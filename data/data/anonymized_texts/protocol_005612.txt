2 PRÉCIS  
Backgroun d: 
• Gray -zone lymphomas (GZL) are rare, aggressive lymphomas that share clinical and 
biological  features of diffuse larg e B-cell lymphoma  (DLBCL)  and Hodgkin lymphoma  
• Standard upfront therapy for GZL is do se-intensive chemotherapy , though disease is often 
resistant; consolidative radiation therapy reserved for patients who are relapsed or 
refractory , and patients  who fail radiation therapy  have a poor prognosis  
• Primary central nervous system lympho ma (PCNSL) , primary testicular lymphoma  (PTL) , 
primary breas t lymphoma (PBL) , primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg -type, and intravascular 
B-cell lymphoma (IVBCL) are rare, aggressive extranodal  subset s of DLBCL  that usually 
have gene expression signatures of activated B -cell (ABC) DL BCL 
• ABC -DLBCL  has cure rate s below 40% after standard therapy, and is  associated with late 
recurrences , often involving the CNS  where treatment options are limited by chemotherapy 
resistance  and a n inability of many agents to cross the blood -brain barrier  
• Molecular biology studies of  GZL  and extranodal  DLBCL  have identified potentially 
targetable genetic features  involving the  programmed death -1 (PD -1) signaling pathway  
• A high proportion of GZL, PCNSL , and PTL  cases  have  copy number alterations or 
chromosomal rearrangements involving the PD -1 ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2 
• Pembrolizumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that tar gets the PD -1 receptor, is 
a rational therap eutic  target  for patients with relapsed and refractory  GZL, PCNSL , PTL, 
and other extranodal  DLBCL   
Objectives:  
• To determine th e best overall response rate of pembrolizumab in patient s with relapsed and 
refractory GZL  and extranodal  DLBCL  
Eligibility:  
• Confirmed diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma, relapsed from or refractory to prior : 
o Cohort 1:  B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with feat ures intermediate between 
diffuse large B -cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (i.e., Gray -zone 
lymphoma  or GZL)   
o Cohort 2:  Extranodal  diffuse large B -cell lymphoma  involving one or more of the 
specified extranodal sites (i.e., extranodal DLBCL)  
• Adequate bone marrow and organ function defined  
• Age greater than or equal to 18 years  
Design:  
• Phase 2 study of patients  with relapsed and refractory GZL  and extranodal  DLBCL  
• Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg (flat dose) IV every 3 weeks provided 
they have clinical benefit  and no unacceptable toxicity; patients  who achieve a complete 
response  (CR) will have the option stop after 1 year of therapy . 
• All res ponding patients  (CR, PR, or SD with clinical benefit) who subsequently relapse or 
progress within 1 year after discontinuation of study drug are eligible for re -treatment.  
• At least 20 evaluable patients  each with GZL and DLBCL  will be evaluated on this pr otocol  
for the primary endpoint  (overall  accrual ceiling of 52 patients )

1 INTRODUCTIO N 
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objective  
To determine the best overall response rate of pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory 
B-cell lymphoma, uncl assifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B -cell 
lymphoma and classical Hodgkin l ymphoma (heretofore referred to as gray-zone lymphoma s 
(GZL) and extranodal diffuse large B -cell lymphomas (DLBCL)  that involve 1 or more extranodal

pembrolizumab and can be us ed for monitoring disease  
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Trial Design  Summary  
This study will evaluate pembrolizumab in 2 different cohorts of patients : one cohort of gray-zone 
lymphoma s (GZL) and a second cohort of extranodal  DLBCL that includes primary CNS 
lymphoma (PCNSL), p rimary testicular lymphoma (PTL), primary breast lymphoma (PBL), 
primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg -type, and i ntravascular B -cell lymphoma (IVBCL ) 
1.2.2 Gray -Zone Lymphoma s 
Gray zone lymphomas (GZL) are a rare heterogeneous group of aggressive B -cell lymphomas first 
recognized in the World Health Org anization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms in 
2008 as a B -cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B -
cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cH L).  Most  cases present in the 
mediastinum of young patients and are known as mediastinal gray zone lymphomas (MGZL)2-4. 
The indeterminate pathobiology of MGZL has led to unc ertainty about its optimal therapeutic 
approach5. A recent prospective study looked at the outcome of MGZL following treatment with 
the dose -adjusted, infusional regimen of etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH -R) and report ed a 5 -year event -free survival (EFS) of 
62% and a 5 -year overall survival (OS) of 74%.6  Although this regimen cures the majority of 
patients with MGZL, these results were inferior to the re sults in primary mediastinal B -cell 
lymphoma ( PMBL ) where DA -EPOCH -R resulted in 5 -year EFS and OS of 93% an d 97%, 
respectively6. Further, patients with MGZL  were more likely to require  consolidative radiotherapy 
to the mediastinum s uggesting more intrinsic chemotherapy resistance.  Patients with GZL who 
are refractory to radiation therapy have a grave prognosis and constitute an unmet clinical need7. 
Other GZL  are less comm only encountered with clinical outcomes less well described.  
Recent  studies have investigated  the underlying molecular biology of MGZL and other GZLs4. 
Over 60% of MGZL  cases have amplification  or copy number alter ations involving a region of 
chrom osome 9p24 that encodes  critical genes in the PD -1 pathway such as PD-L1, PD-L2 and 
JAK28-10. These  genetic aberrations result in overexpression of PD -1 and its ligands, suggesting  
that PD -1 signaling is important for tumor surviv al. Block ing the PD-1 pathway  may result in both 
direct anti -tumor effects related to PD -1 signaling as well as restoration of the immune anti -tumor 
response by enhancing T -cell and NK -cell function11.  Based on these hypotheses, we have  
recently treated two pati ents with refractory MGZL with p embrolizumab , and both patients 
achieved a complete response to ther apy ( authors’ unpublished data, accepted for publication).   
Both of these patients had genetic alterations of 9p24.1 , suggesting  a disease -specific, genetically 
Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
8 determined dependence on PD -1 for survival.  These cases provide early evidence for further 
testing of pembrolizumab in a larger cohort of p atients with relapsed  and refractory MGZL.  
1.2.3 Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL)  
Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare disease representing less than 3% of all non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma s12.  The term encompasses all aggressive  lymphomas that arise in the brain 
parenchyma, spinal cord, eyes, cranial nerves and meninges .  PCNSL spreads  outside t he CNS in 
fewer than 5% of cases .  Most cases  of PCNSL  are diffuse large B -cell lymphomas (DLBCL). The 
incidence of PNCSL has been increasing; particularly in immunocompetent hosts and in patients 
over the age of 65 years12. PCNSL also occur s in patients who are HIV -positive, but this en tity is  
virtually always associated with EBV  and is a biologically distinct disease from those in 
immunocompetent patients.  
Compared to patients with systemic DLBCL, the outcome for patients with PCNSL is poor as late 
recurrences  are common13. The standard t reatment  approach  to PCNSL differs significantly from 
systemic DLBCL because many chemotherapy agents , such as anthracyclines,  do not adequately 
pene trate the blood -brain barrier. While radiotherapy  (XRT)  can overcome this limitation, 
remissio ns are of only short duration.   Further, XRT  is associated with significant acute and 
delayed neurotoxicity that limits its use in patients over the age of 60 years.  High dose 
methotrexate (HD -MTX), an agent with good CNS penetration, has formed the backbone of 
systemic  therapy for PCNSL , but produces a progression -free survival of only 7 months  as a single 
agent14.  The comb ination of  HD-MTX with XRT  improves the remission rate, but is associated 
with late relapses and treatment -associated  neurotoxicity limits the use of combined modality 
therapy in many patients15,16. 
Combination imm unochemotherapy platforms have been developed with the goal of applying dose 
intensive regimens that induce remissions without the need for radiation therapy.  The various 
systemic agents that have been added to HD -MTX include rituximab, hig h-dose cytarabi ne, 
etoposide, thiotepa and temozolomide17-19.  Although such combination  regimens are effective at 
inducing remissions in the majority of patients, late relapses are common and fewer than 30% of 
patients are cured  with this standard approach13. 
Recent studies have  focused on the development of  targeted agents  in PCNSL on the basis of its 
underlying molecular biology.  PCNSL tumors commonly have a gene expression signature and 
share many molecular features that resemble the ABC subtype  of systemic DLBCL20,21. As a 
whole, the ABC subtype of DLBCL has a poorer prognosis than other subtypes, is associated with 
late relapses, and commonly involves the CNS22.  Sequencing -based appr oaches have shown that 
the genomic landscape of PCNSL is enriched for mutations in the B -cell receptor (BCR) signaling 
and MYD88 pathway23-28. Published results from 7 studies of CD79B  and MYD88 sequences in 
tumors from patients with PCNSL demonstrate that 76% of cases  have either a MYD88  L265P 
mutation or a mutation in the ITAM motif of CD79B , including 37% of cases that have both 
mutations23-28.  Ibrutinib is an oral inhibitor  of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK)  and is particularly 
active in systemic ABC DLBCLs suggesting that it would be highly effective in PCNSL29. Indeed, 
recent studies have shown that ibruti nib monotherapy resu lts in clinical remissions in a high 
number of patients, but of only short duration as a single agent.30-32 Lenalidomide is ano ther novel 
agent  with single agent activity in ABC DLBCL that is  under clinical development in PCNSL.33  
Similar to ibrutinib, single agent lenalidomide demonstrates clinical responses in PCNSL, but they 
tend to be of brief duration.

9 Additional targetable genetic features of PCNSL  have also recently been reported by Chapuy and 
colleagues27.  Using an integrative approach, they characterized the recurrent somatic mutations, 
chromosomal rearrangements, and copy number alterations in PCNSL.  T he authors identified a 
unique set of abnormalities  in PCNSL characterized by g enomic instability, abnormal signaling 
through the Toll -like receptor (TLR)  pathway; often in combination with activat ion of the BCR  
pathway, and upregulation of PD -1 ligands.   Copy gains of 9p24.1, which includes the genes for 
programmed death -ligands 1 a nd 2 ( PDL1  and PDL2 ) were found in more than 50% of case s of 
PCNSL . Since PD -1 inhibitors have demonstrated the ability to induce clinical responses in a 
variety of aggressive B -cell lymphomas, these pre -clinical data provide strong rationale to test 
anti-PD-1 therapy in relapsed cases of PCNSL34-37.  Indeed, a recent report of 4 patients with 
relapsed and refractory PCNSL  showed  that tar geting the PD-1 pathway can induce remissions in 
patients with  relapsed  and refractory PCNSL  without unexpected toxicities38.  Further testing of 
PD-1 inhibitors in patients with relapsed  and refrac tory PCNSL is clearly warranted and a multi -
center study is currently underway with nivolumab [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] .   
1.2.4 Primary Testicular Lymphoma (PTL) and other extranodal  ABC lymphomas   
Additional rare extranodal  forms of DLBCL share a biologic link to PCNSL  and are included in 
this study .  These lymphomas have clinical similarities to PCNSL including frequent involvement 
of immune -privileged sites and a propensity to remain confined within  the involved  organ unti l 
late stages of disease .  The specifi ed extranodal  forms of DLBCL  include primary testicular 
lymphoma (PT L), primary breast lymphoma (PBL), intravascular B -cell lymphoma (IVLBCL), 
and primary cutaneous diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, leg -type.  All of these lymphomas are  
predominantly  of the A BC subtype and harbor  frequent  mutations of CD79B  and MYD8839-46. 
Additional  evidenc e suggesting a biologic link among  these tumors is a common pattern of disease 
spread.  Many of these extranodal  ABC lymphomas eit her involve the CNS at diagnosis or at the 
time of recurrence .47  
A biologic link between PCNSL and P TL has recently been demonstrated  with comprehensive 
molecular characterization .  Chapuy et al. characterized  PTL tumors on the basis of  recurrent 
mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and copy number alterations27.  The authors found that 
both PCNSL and PTL share remarkably similar combinations of genetic features including  
frequent alterations of 9p24.1, PD-L1, and PD-L2.  Indeed, these authors have anecdotally re ported 
that PD -1 pathway blockade was effective in  a case of relapsed PTL, and a multicenter study is 
underway testing PD -1 inhibitors in relapsed and refractory PCNSL and PTL [ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]].  
The other extranodal  DLBCL subsets included in this study are hypothesized to have similar 
molecular biology  since  they are almost exclu sively of the ABC subtype and share common 
clinical behavior .   Given the low incidence of these tumors and strong rationale for potential 
benefit, they are included in this study in the same cohort as PCNSL and PTL.  
1.2.5 Programmed cell death pathway (PD -1) as a therapeutic target  
Immune surveillance plays a key regulatory role in the development of many lymphomas, and 
GZL and the extranodal  DLBC L subtypes included in this protocol are hypothesized to have  
acquired tolerogenic mechanisms that permit them to evade an effective immune response.  
Programmed Cell Death -1 (PD -1; CD279) is a cell surface signaling molecule that delivers 
inhibitory signal s that regulate the balance between T cell activation and tolerance by interacting 
with its li gands, PD -L1 (CD274; B7 -H1) and PD -L2 (B7 -DC/CD273).  PD-1 is primarily expressed 
on activated T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells.48 PD-1expression can also be detected on memory 
T-cell subsets with variable levels . Upon ligand binding to PD -1, T-cell activation is down -
Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
10 regulated in both murine and human systems . The interaction of PD -1 on tumor specific cytotoxic 
T cells with its ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2 causes a decrease in the ability of these cells to 
proliferate  and exert cytotoxic effects, increases their apoptotic rate and alters the functional 
characterist ics of the cells to produce a tolerogenic phenotype. Inhibition of the interaction 
between PD -1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen -specifi c T-cell responses 
to both foreign antigens as well as self -antigens. Since these responses are var iable and dependent 
upon various host genetic factors, PD -1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a universal 
loss of tolerance to self -antigens.  
PD-L1 expression may be a mechanism by which tumors can directly engage PD -1 to evade an 
effective an ti-tumor immune response.  PD-L1 expression by malignant tumor cells is a marker of 
poor prognosis in aggressive lymphomas such as diffuse large B -cell lympho ma (DLBCL) .49 Other 
cells in the tumor microenvironment of these tumors such as T cells, dendrit ic cells, and monocytes 
are also positive for PD -L1 and have the potential to interact with tumor specific T cells tha t 
express PD -1.49 Blocking PD -1 may reverse the inactivation of tumor -specific effector T -cells at 
the tumor site, as well as activate anti -tumor responses that are limited by PD -L1 expression on 
host cytotoxic cel ls. 
The host’s adaptive immune response to inhibitors of th e PD -1 axis has not been completely 
characterized and is a research priority .  Pre -clinical studies in mice with chronic viral infections 
established that a subset of exhausted CD8 T -cells can be r escued with inhibition of the PD -L1/PD -
1 axis and can be fu nctionally restored.50 In lung cancer, increases in the peripheral blood of CD8+ 
T-cells with an effector phenotype have been observed after PD -1 inhibitio n.51  These increases 
tend to  occur early and are associated with clinical response. Predictive biomarkers that identify 
specific T -cell sub -populations still capable of being restored have not been established, ho wever.    
1.2.6 Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -
L1 and PD -L2.  Keyt rudaTM (pembrolizumab ) has been approved in the United Stated for the 
treatment of patients with  metastatic melanoma, metastatic non -small cell lung cancer, recurrent 
or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and recurrent and refractory classic al 
Hodgkin lymphoma.  
1.2.6.1  Rational e for dosing  
An open -label Phase I trial has been  conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single 
agent pembrolizumab .  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, a nd 10 mg/kg, administered eve ry 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with ad vanced 
solid tumors.  All of three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were 
observed.  This  first in human study of pembrolizumab showed  evidence of target engagement and 
objective evidence of  tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in this 
phase 1 study , will be the dose and schedule utilized in this protocol to test for initial t umor activity.  
Recent data from ot her clinical studies within the pembrolizumab  program has shown that a lower

clinical activity.  
A population pharmacokinetic a nalysis has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of

Version Date:  03/05/2021  
11 pembrolizumab  were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship between clearance 
and b ody weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for other 
antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body 
weights.  Pembro lizumab  has been found to have a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma 
indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg 
Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established  exposure 
margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for pembrolizumab  in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are 
based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed 
dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and e xposure). The population PK 
evaluation revealed that the re was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, 
exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no 
anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings. In this study the planned  
dose of pembrolizumab will be 200mg  every 3 weeks until confirmed disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity , with an option for a treatment interruption in cases of response and 
retreatment upon p rogression . 
1.2.6.2  Efficacy of Pembrolizumab  in Classical Hodgk in lymphoma  
A phase I study of pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies  
(KEYNOTE -13) is ongoing [NCT 01953692 ]. Patients are treated with 10mg/m2 of 
pembrolizumab every 2 weeks until disease progression  unless or excessive  toxicity.  Responses 
were assessed at week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter.  Since patients with classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL) frequently exhibit genetic alterations in the PD -1 pathway, this cohort was 
assessed independently .  A total of 31 patients w ith cHL with relapsed or refractory disease were 
included in this analysis.  All patients had been previously treated with brentuximab vedotin and 
71% and undergone autolog ous ste m cell transplantation. The overall response rate to 
pembrolizumab monotherap y was 65% (90% CI, 48% to 79%) with the majority of responses 
lasting longer than 6 months.  Further, 5 patients (16 %) had a complete response ( CR) at 12 weeks.  
Given the promisin g response rate in cHL, a multi -center phase II study (KEYNOTE -087) has 
recen tly been completed testing the response rate of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with 
relapsed and refractory cHL52.  In this study, three cohorts of cHL patients were included for a 
total of 210 patients.  Th e ORR of the entire group was 69% (95% CI, 62.3% to 75.2%) and the 
CR rate was 22.4% (95% CI, 16.9% to 28.6%).  Patients receiv ed a median of 13 treatment cycles 
and many patients had responses lasting longer than 6 months. This study led to accelerated FD A 
approval of pembrolizumab for relapsed and refractory cHL.  
1.2.6.3  Adverse event profile  of Pembrolizumab in Lymphoid Malignancies  
All patients treated with PD -1 inhibitors require monitoring for the development of immune -
related complications including, but not  limited to, diarrhea, pneumonitis, and rash.  Given that 
this study will include patients with tumors involving the CNS, speci al concern for immune -related 
complications  within the CNS will be implemented.  Overall, in the phase 1 study of 
pembrolizumab i n cHL, t here were n o serious adverse events (SAEs) or grade 3 -4 AEs related to 
treatment34. Overal l, 5 patients experienced a grade 3  drug-related AE.  The most common drug -
related AEs were grade 1 -2 respiratory ev ents (20%) and thyroid disorders (20%). One patient 
discontinued study treatment because of an AE (grade 2 pneumonitis), and 3 patients ended therapy 
after progressive disease (PD).  In the phase II study in patients with cHL, the s afety profile was 
as exp ected.  The most common treatment -related AEs were hypothyroidism (12.4% and pyrexia 
(10.5%), while the most common grade 3 -4 treatment -related AEs were neutropenia (2.4%), 
Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
12 dyspnea (1%), and diarrhea (1%). In conclusion, pembrolizum ab therapy appears to be  safe, 
tolerable, and associated with clinical benefit in patients with heavily pretreated cHL.   
1.2.7 Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers  
Predictive biomarkers within baseline tumor tissue or in the peripheral blood are a research priority 
shared across  all immuno -oncology studies.  The identification of reliable biomarkers that can 
predict either response or toxicity may enhance individualized treatment decisions.  The e xpression 
of PD -L1 by immunohistochemistry in malignant and surrounding inflammatory cells has been 
demonstrated as a  predictor of response to PD -1 inhibitors  in various studies . In lymphoma, 
however, the expression of PD -1 is present on both malignant cells as well as non -malignant cells 
in the tumor microenvironment. Further , expression of PD -1 is expe cted in the majority of cases, 
so simply the presence or absence may not predict for response.  Therefore, localization of PD -1 
staining will be assessed on this study as well as longitudinal sampling on optional biopsies  taken 
during therapy and at the tim e of progression.  
Currently, there is an incomplete understanding of the molecular pathways that are susceptible to 
inhibition of PD -1. A molecular profile may exist that identify patients likely (or unlikely) to 
respond to PD -1 inhibition . In a study of patients  with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, pre -treatment 
tumor specimens from multiple patients  revealed copy -number gains in PD -L1 and PD -L2 and 
increased expression of these ligands.37 In patients  with lung cancer, the number of non -
synonymous mutations in the pre -treatment biopsy specimen predicted likelihood of response to 
PD-1 inhibitor .53 In melanoma, the absence of PTEN expression has been asso ciated with a lack 
of clini cal response to PD -1 inhibitors54.  A comprehensive molecular profile will be used on 
baseline and sequential tumor samples and utilize DNA/RNA sequencing as well as copy number 
alterations as part of the explo ratory analysis to identify genetic profiles of tumors that are likeliest 
to respond to pembrolizumab.  
Another research priority is to identify potential biomarkers in the peripheral blood and CSF that 
correlate with response or toxicity.  A recent study d emon strated that PD -1 inhibitors  result in an 
increase in the number of CD8+Ki-67+PD-1+ effector T -cells in the peripheral blood shortly after 
initiation of therapy in patients with lung cancer51.  We will use multi -parameter flow cytometry 
for T -cell and NK -cell subsets and monitor the peripheral blood for an e arly host adaptive immune 
response (6 weeks), a “rebound effect” (18 weeks), at 1 years, and 2 years.  In addition, we will 
assess the host immune response at th e time of disease progression. In the case of patients with 
PCNSL, these tests will also be per formed longitudinally in the CSF and correlated with response . 
Tissue biopsy specimens and peripheral bloo d samples obtained while on pembrolizumab  therapy 
may i dentify other potential biomarkers that predict response and/or help elucidate the mechanisms 
of treatment resistance at the cellular level.

20 3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a  non-randomized, open -label, single arm, single institution phase 2 study of 
pembrolizumab in patients  with relapsed or refractory GZL or extranodal  DLBCL  (including 
PCNSL) .  The patients with GZL  and extranodal  DLBCL  will be enrolled into two (2) separate , 
disease -specific  cohorts.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2 DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
Each cycle of treatment is 21 days or 3 weeks.  The minimum window betw een cycles due to 
scheduling or other administrative reasons is 18 days (i.e., 21 days -3 days).   
All patients  will receive single -agent pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of  200 milligrams ( mg) 
administered via intravenous (IV) infusion every 21 days (3 weeks ).  Dosing of pembrolizumab is 
fixed; not based upon subject weight.  Infusions may be done peripherally or via central venous 
access device, etc.  
Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30 -minute infusion.  Every effort should be made to 
target the infus ion timing as close to 30 minutes as possible; however, a preferred window of -
5/+10 minutes to account for variability of infusion pumps is permitted (i.e., anticipated infusion 
window of 25 -40 minutes).   
Treatment will be on an outpatient basis; however , at the investigator’s discretion (e.g., for 
additional monitoring, patient social reasons, etc.), patients may be treated on an inpatient basis.  
Any cases of planned hospitalization are not considered reportable serious adverse events per 
Section 7. 
Bloods for correlates collected prior to treatment, after cycles 2 and 6,  and at approximately 
months 9, 12, 18, and ever y 6 months thereafter.   
Tissue for correlates collected prior to trea tment (archival or fresh); with optional fresh tumor 
biopsy at baseline, after 2 cycles, and at disease progression.   
 
Disease evaluations will be performed prior to treatment and after initiation of treatment at the 
same time points at correlate blood s ample collection.

3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Adverse events (both non -serious  [AEs]  and serious  [SAEs] ) associat ed with pembrolizumab  
exposure may represent an immunologic et iology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after 
the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.   
Pembrolizumab must  be withheld  for all drug-related  toxicities  and severe or life -threatening AEs 
as per below.  See Section  3.3.1  for immune -related event supportive care guidelines, including 
use of  corticosteroids.  
For any other, non -immune related AEs/SAEs, the treating investigator may use discretion with 
regards to dose holds, modificat ions, and supportive care.  NOTE:  S ee Section 3.3.3  for guidelines 
and management specific to infusion reaction/infusion -related toxicity,    
Dosing interruptions are p ermitted in the case of medical and/or  surgical events or logistical 
reasons not related to study therapy  (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient 
vacation, and/or holidays).  Patients  should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption , whenev er possible .  The reason for interruption should be documented in 
the medical/research record s.  These interruptions will not be considered protocol deviations.  
3.3.1 Immune -Related Toxicity Management  
Patients  should receive appropriate supportive care measures  as deemed necessary by the treating 
investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below (i.e., immune -related adverse events or irAEs). 
Where appropriate, t hese guid elines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary 
as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should 
be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease  or bacterial or viral infection, which 
might require additional supportive care. The  treatment guideli nes are intended to be applied when 
the investigator  determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab .  
NOTE:   If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator  does not 
need to follow the treatment guidance  (as outlin ed b elow) . Refer to Section 3.3 for dose 
modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event.

22 3.3.2 Immune -Related  Adverse Events  
General Instructions:  
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.  
2. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid 
has been tapered. Pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last d ose or corticosteroids cannot be 
reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12  weeks.  
3. For severe and life -threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid. Other immunosuppressive treatment sh ould be 
initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids .

administration.  
3.4 ON STUD Y EVALUATIONS  
Upon confirmation of eligibility and successful registration, and following completion of the 
Screening/Baseline visit, patients  will begin treatment with pembrolizumab.  Patients  must 
Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
26 maintain eligibility for any assessments/tests repeated p ost-registrati on and prior to administration 
of the first dose of pembrolizumab.   
After Cycle 1, pre -dose assessments may be performed up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of a cycle  (7 
days for imaging),  except where otherwise noted.  The results from all procedu res/tests must  be 
reviewed prior to initiation of each cycle of treatment for consideration of dose modifications.   
Pembrolizumab will continue until disease progression  absent clinical benefit , unacceptable 
treatment -related toxicit y, or other reasons ou tlined in Sect ion 3.10.1 .  
Refer to the Study Calendar (Section  3.8) for all tests and procedures to be con ducted during 
screening/baseline, on study/during trea tment, and upon discontinuation of treatment and during 
follow -up.   
In summary, t he following will be done at follow -up visits per the Study Calendar:  
3.4.1 Clinical Evaluations

27 • Required:  Blood samples  
• Optional:  Tumor biopsy at the first disease re -evaluation time point (i.e. , after 2 cycles) 
and at disease progression   
• Select patients only:  CSF samples (i.e., in patients with Ommaya or planned routine  
procedure)  
3.5 TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS /EXCEPTIONS  
3.5.1 Treatment Beyond Progression (“Ps eudo -progression”)  
A minority of patients  treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despite initial 
evidence of progressive (PD).  Patients  suspected to have PD b y response criteria will be permitted 
to continue pembrolizumab treatment beyond confirmed PD as measured by the appropriate 
evaluation criteria as long as they meet all of the following criteria as determined by the 
investigator:  
• Investigator assessed cli nical benefit  
• Subject is tolerating pembrolizumab  
• Stable performance status  
• Absen ce of other signs and symptoms indicating disease progression  
• Absence of evidence to suggest that other or alternative medical intervention or treatment 
is needed to treat th e disease  
Patients  that meet the above criteria should have repeat radiographic evaluation within 6 weeks of 
initial investigator -assessed progression to determine whether there has been a decrease in the 
tumor size or continued PD.  
3.5.2 Discontinuation of Stud y Therapy  
3.5.2.1  Post-24 Months of Treatment  
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for patients  who have completed 24 months of 
uninterrupted treatment with pembro lizumab or 35 administrations of study medication, whichever 
is later  (24 months of study medication is calculated from the date of first dose ).  Patients  who stop 
pembrolizumab after 24 months may be eligible for up to one year of additional treatment with 
pembrolizumab via the Second Course Phase at the discretion of the investigator if no ca ncer 
treatment was administered since the last dose of pembrolizumab, the subject meets the safety 
parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion cr iteria, and the trial is open .  Patients  will resume 
therapy at the same dose and schedule at the time of init ial discontinuation.  Additional details are 
provided in Section 3.5.3 . 
3.5.2.2  Post-Complete Response ( CR) 
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered f or patients  who have attained a confirmed CR 
that have been tre ated for at least 1 year  with pembrolizumab and had at least two treatments with 
pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.  Patients  who then experience 
disease relapse  may be eligible for additional treatment with pembrolizumab via t he Second 
Course Phase at the discretion of the investigator if no cancer treatment was administered since 
the last dose of pembrolizumab, the subject meets the safety parameters listed in the 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is open.  Patients  will resume therapy at the same dose 
and schedule at the time of initial discontinuation.  Additional details are provided in Section 3.5.3 .

Version Date:  03/05/2021  
28 3.5.2.3  Discon tinuation Evaluations  
When a subject discontinues, all applicabl e activities scheduled for the End of Treatment Visit  
should be performed at the time of discontinuation  (see Study Calendar ).  Any adverse events 
which are present at the time of  discontinuation  shou ld be followed in accordance with the safety 
requirements outlined in Section 7. 
3.5.3 Second Course Phase (Retreatment Period)  
Patients  who stop pembrolizumab with SD or better may be eligible for up to one year of a dditional 
pembrolizumab therapy if they relapse or progress after stopping study treatment.  This retreatment 
is termed the Second Course Phase of this study and is only available if the study remains open 
and the subject meets the following conditions:  
• Either  
o Stopped initial treatment with pembrolizumab after att aining an investigator -
determined confirmed CR, and  
▪ Was treated for at least 1 year  with pembrolizumab before discontinuing therapy  
▪ Received at least two treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the d ate when the 
initial CR was declared  
  OR 
o Had SD, PR or CR a nd stopped pembrolizumab treatment after 24 months of study 
therapy for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability  
AND  
• Experienced an investigator -determined confirmed radiographic d isease progression or 
relapse after stopping their initial t reatment with pembrolizumab  
• Did not receive any anti -cancer treatment since the last dose of pembrolizumab  
• Has a performance status of 0 -2 on the ECOG Performance Scale  
• Demonstrates adequate organ  function as detailed in Section 2.1.1.6  
• Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative serum or urine pregnancy 
test within 72 hours prior to receiving retreatment with study medication.   
• Fema le subject of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control 
or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the cour se of the study 
through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Section 4.3.2  and 4.3.3 ).  Patients  
of child bearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have been 
free from menses for > 1 year.  
• Male subject should agree  to use an adequate method of co ntraception starting with the 
first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.   
• Does not have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory 
abnormality that might i nterfere with the subject’s part icipation for the full duration of the 
trial or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating 
investigator.  
Patients  who restart treatment will be retreated at the same dose and do se interval as when they 
last re ceived pembrolizumab.  Treatment will be administered for up to one additional year.

Version Date:  03/05/2021  
29 Additionally, the same treatment and testing schedule should be followed at the discretion of the 
investigator (see Section 3.8).   
After discontinuing the Second Course/Retreatment Phase , patients  should return to the site for a 
Safety Follow -up Visit (Section  3.7.1 ) and then proceed to the Follow -Up P eriod of the study 
(Section s 3.7.2  and 3.7.3 ). 
3.6 TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION /POST-TREATMENT EVALUATIONS  
Taking into accoun t required 30 -Day Safety and Follow -Up requireme nts below (Section 3.7), the 
following will be performed at the end of treatment (and at disease pro gression, if subject 
discontinues treatment for a reason other than progression) within 30 days of the last dos e of trial 
treatment (and prior to the start of new anti -cancer therapy).   
In absence of progression or new anti -cancer therapy, follow -up will continue at the following 
time points, unless otherwise noted:  e very 3 months (+/ - 2 week s) for first year aft er completion 
of therapy , every 6 months for years 2 -5 (+/ - 4 weeks) , and then annually  thereafter (+/ - 6 weeks) 
at the discretion of the investigator.  Other assessments should be performed as clinically indicated ; 
see Study Calendar (Section  3.8) for additional information .   
Upon disease progression or initiation of other anti -cancer therapy, contact will be for survival 
only until the subject is off study; unless otherwise clinically indicated.

• Required:  Blood samples  
• Optional:  T umor biopsy (at disease progression ) 
• Select patients only:  CSF samples (i.e., in patients with Ommaya or planned routine 
procedure ) (at disease progression ) 
3.7 FOLLOW -UP EVALUATIONS  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all n ew anti -neoplastic therapy initiated after 
the last dose of trial treatment.  If a subject initiates a new anti -cancer therapy within 30 days after 
the last dose of trial treatment, the 30 -day Safety Follow -up visit must occur before the first dose 
of the new therapy.   
Once new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated the subject will move into survival follow -up. 
3.7.1 30-Day Safety Follow -Up Visit  
The mandato ry Safety Follow -Up Visit should be conducted approximately 30 days after the last 
dose of trial treatmen t or before the initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment, whichever comes 
first.  All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be rec orded.  Patients  with an 
AE of Grade > 1 will be followed until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0 -1 or until the beginning 
of a new anti -neoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.  SAEs that occur within 90 days of the 
end of treatment and before initia tion of a new anti -cancer treatment should also be followed and 
recorded.  Patients  who are eligible for retreatment with pembrolizumab (as described in Section  
3.5.3 ) may have up to two safety follow -up visits,  one after the Treatment Period and one a fter the 
Second Course Phase.  
3.7.2 Follow -Up Visits – Prior to Disease Progression  
Patients  who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move into 
the Follow -Up Phase and should be ass essed approximately every 3 months clinically and every 6 
months by  radiologic imaging to monitor disease status  (see Section 3.6 for full information and 
Study Calendar, Section  3.8).  Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease 
status until the start of new anti -neoplastic therapy, disease progression, death, end of the study or 
if the subject begins retreatment with pembrolizumab as detailed  in Section 3.5.3 .  Information 
regarding post -study anti -neoplastic treatment will be collected if new treatment is initiated.    
Patients  who are eligible to receive retreatment with pembrolizumab according to the criteria in 
Section 3.5.3  will move from the follow -up phase to the Second Course Phase when they 
experience disease progression.   
3.7.3 Follow -Up Visits – Survival/Post -Disease Progression  
Once a subject experie nces confi rmed disease progression or starts a new anti -cancer therapy, the 
subject moves into the survival follow -up phase and should be contacted approximately  every 12 
weeks to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of  the study , 
whichever occurs first  (see Study Calendar ).

4 CONC OMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES  
Medications or vaccinati ons specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during 
the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohi bited during the trial, discontinuation from trial th erapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with 
the Merck Clinical team .  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with 
the investigator and/or the subject's primary physicia n. 
4.1 ACCEPTABLE MEDICATIONS  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be administered 
at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standard s of medical care.  All 
concomitant medication will b e recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, 
over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes occur 
during the trial period, documentation of  drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be 
included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment and 
until 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment  or until start of next treatment , whichever occurs 
first, should be recorded.  Concom itant medications administered after 30 days after the last dose 
of trial treatment should also be recorded for SAEs and ECIs (Section  7). 
4.2 PROHIBITED MEDICATI ONS 
Patients  are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and Treatment 
Phase (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy   
o NOTE :  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
allowed at the investigator’s dis cretion .   
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating 
in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: 
measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rab ies, BCG, a nd typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event 
of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology  are generally not allowed.  For 
subjects who are on stable doses of steroids (i.e. , ≤ 10 mg/d ay of dexamethasone or 

Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
35 equivalent) at study entry, the investigator should try to taper/discontinue dosing after 
initiation of therapy, if appropriate .  Other e xceptions include t he use of physiologic doses 
of corticosteroids and steroid use for  acute issu es (e.g., for up to 2 weeks unless otherwise 
felt to be clinically necessary in the opinion of the PI to continue for longer) after 
consultation with the PI.  
Patients  who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the afor ementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Patients  may receive other 
medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this t rial. 
There  are no prohibited therapies during the Post -Treatment Follow -up Phase . 
4.3 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  
4.3.1 Diet 
Patients  should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as 
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
4.3.2 Contraception  
Pembro lizumab  may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab  has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.   
For this trial, male patients  will be considered to be of non -reproductive potential if they h ave 
azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).   
Female patients  will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they are either:  
1. Postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alte rnative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women 
not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. I n the a bsence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.); OR  
2. have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or 
bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening; OR  
3. has a c ongenit al or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  
Female and male patients  of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or 
impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for 120 days after the last 
dose of  study drug by complying with one of the following:   
1. practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity; OR  
2. use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.   
4.3.3 Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
4.3.3.1  Single method   
Use of one of the following is acceptable : 
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
36 4.3.3.2  Combination method  
Requires use of two of the following : 
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in  conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrog en/progestin pill or progestin -only 
pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive 
injection  
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently 
employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies 
and ERCs/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc.) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable  methods of contraception.   
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an 
acceptable method of contraception for patients  participating at sites in this country/region.  
Patients  shoul d be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the 
study patients  of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requi rement (described 
above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study 
medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose 
of trial therapy.  If there is any question that a subject of childbearing potential will not reliably 
comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study.  
4.3.4 Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab , the subject 
will immediately be removed from the study  treatment .  The site will contact the subject at least 
monthly and document the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  
The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported t o Merck without delay and within 2 working days 
to Merck  if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, 
or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn).   
The study investigator will  make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of 
the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to Merck .  If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately 
and the  pregnancy reported  to Merck and followed as described above and in Section 8.1.4.3 . 
4.3.5 Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab  is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are excreted 
in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions i n the nursing infant, 
patients  who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
5 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
5.1 SUMMARY  
The signaling pathways immediately disrupted by PD -1 blockade as well as the compensatory 
pathways that emerge with PD -1 blockade are poorly understood.  The magnitude and duration of 
PD-1 blockade is expected to correlate with clinical benefit.  Understanding the biology of the

37 tumor microenvironment both pre -/post -treatmen t will be critical for evaluating the role that 
pembrolizumab plays in modulating the immune system and its response to PD -1 blockade. 
Molecular profiling of malignant cells and the tumor microenvironment in the tissue may be a 
biologic correlate of tumor response.

40 5.2.3.1  Cytokines  and serum banking  
• Collect blood in Serum Separato r Tubes (e.g., red/gray  or red/yellow speckled top); 
gently invert the tubes 8 -10 times immediately after collection and allow the blood 
to clot by at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.   
• Serum will be isolated and frozen at -80ºC  until analysi s (e.g., centrifuged at 1200 x 
g for 5 minutes at 4 ºC; serum transferred/frozen in aliquots of 1.5 -2 mL each).   
5.2.3.2  Cell-free DNA (cfDNA)/Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) and plasma banking  
• Collect blood in cell -free DNA (e.g., Streck BCT/ collectio n tubes)  and K2EDTA  
tubes; gently invert the tubes 8 -10 times immediately after collection.   
• Plasma will be isolated and frozen at -80ºC  until analysis (e.g., centrifuged at 1800 x 
g for 10 minutes at room temperature; plasma transferred/frozen in aliquot s of 1.5 -2 
mL each). Tissue Samples  
5.2.4 Tissue Samples  
5.2.4.1  Archival  tissue  
Archival block(s) or slides (i.e., at least 15 unstained slides, 5 -microns) is required at 
baseline; these may also be required in follow -up in case of future routine procedures or 
in case additional tis sue is needed even in the event of optional tumor biopsy .   
5.2.4.2  Lymph node excision  or core needle biopsy procedure  
Lymph node excision or core needle biopsy will be performed per routine standard of 
care, by Surgery Consultants or Interventional  Radiology, as  appropriate.  A procedure -
specific consent form will be signed by the patient prior to the procedure.  Every attempt 
will be made to perform excisional lymph node biopsies to obtain the best quality tissue 
for translational investigation.  C onsideration o f alternative biopsy methods (e.g., core 
needle biopsy) will only be made if follow -up excisional biopsy is not possible/safe or 
patient is unwilling to undergo repeat excisional lymph node biopsy.  
In the event that a surgical biopsy procedur e is performed , more than one lymph node and 
at more than one anatomic site may be collected, provided the additional procedures are 
not unacceptable risk to the patient.  In the event of core needle biopsy, these are obtained 
typically by using a 16 -18G needle at the d iscretion of the provider performing the 
procedure.  Conscious sedation may be used, if warranted, and the use and risks are 
acceptable to the patient.   
Potential site(s) of biopsy include, but are not limited to:  bone marrow lesions, bony 
lesions, extra medullary disease/masses, and lymph nodes.  The type of procedure to be 
done and manner in which it will proceed (e.g., excision/core, single vs. multiple sit es of 
biopsy) will be discussed with the patient prior to the biopsy procedure.  The patient will 
be reminded that all sampling for research is voluntary.  
5.2.4.3  Sample handling/processing  
When performed, excisions or core biopsies will be placed in sterile coll ection/core 
cylinder tubes (e.g., formalin); gently invert/inspect tubes with media 8 -10 times 
immediately after collection to ensure the core(s) is completed immersed in the media.

41 Tissue  samples will be handled/processed as below prior to planned analyse s, as 
appropriate:  
• Any required routine review for histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis and/o r 
grade will occur per standard of care (e.g., H&E, immunohistochemistry), if required.   
• Formalin samples will be fixed and paraffin -embedded per routine tec hniques.   
5.2.5 Other Samples  
5.2.5.1  Germline DNA  
Germline DNA will be collected by blood, buccal swab, and/or  saliva samples 
(preferred).  These will ideally be collected at baseline; however, may be collected at any 
point on study based on supplies.  Standardized, commercial collection kits or tubes wil l 
be used (e.g., 1, 5-10 mL K 2EDTA tube  for blood; Isohelix SK-1 for buccal swabs; 
Salviette/Oragene® for saliva).  In the case of buccal swabs, two (2) samples may be 
collected in order to ensure adequate DNA collection.     
The samples will be processed and DNA extracted/isolated per kit instructions and 
establis hed techniques.  These will also be handled by Dr. Figg’s lab (see Section 5.2.3  
for contact information).  
5.2.5.2  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)  
• Collect CSF in K 2EDTA tubes  or sterile syringes ; gently invert tubes 8 -10 time s 
immediately after collection.   
• Samples will be processed per routine laboratory techniques.  These will be handled 
by both (i.e ., one tube each) Dr. Figg’s and Trepel’s labs (see above for contact 
information).   
5.3 BIOMARKER AND RESEARCH METHODS  
The techn ology platforms that are able to interrogate genomic structure and function are constantly 
in flux; therefore, the exact nature of  the methodologies that will be employed will be assessed at 
the time that the samples are collected and ready for analysis.  
The following are technologies that are currently in use for each planned analysis:   
5.3.1 Molecular Profiling  
Immunohistochemical (IHC ) analyses  will take part in tumor tissue samples, including but not 
necessarily limited to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD45RO, CD57,  CD68, FOZP3, Granzyme B, 
LAG3, PD -1/PD -L1 (H -score), CD14, CD33, CD163 and/or CD206.   FISH probe for 9p.24 
amplification will be done on all available pre -treatment FFPE specimens.  
5.3.2 Immune Subset Analysis  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be a ssessed using multiparameter flow cytometry 
for immune subsets including but not necessarily limited to CD8+ T -cells, CD4+Foxp3 - T-cells, 
Tregs, T ex, Th1, Th2 and Th17+ CD4+ T -cells, monocyte subsets, MDSC subsets. Assessment 
will include functional marker s, i.e. PD -1, Tim -3, CTLA -4, PD -L1, HLA -DR, Ki67 and/or CD40.  
5.3.3 Peripheral Blood Metabolism Gene Expression  
Peripheral metabolic tra nscriptional signature will be evaluated using the NanoString nCounter ® 
platform (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA). We wi ll use the nCounter 180 gene cancer 
metabolism panel, built in collaboration with the Urologic Oncology Branch. Peripheral blood w ill 

Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
42 be collected in a PAXgene tube (PreAnalytix; 2.5 cc peripheral blood per tube) per the 
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA wi ll be isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
5.3.4 Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)  
CTCs will be isolated and evaluated per established techniques in the Trepel laboratory (e.g., flow -
based analysis).  As analysis i s primarily exploratory, technique(s) may be adjusted over the course 
of the study to determine the best methods for analysis.    
5.3.5 DNA/RNA Sequencing  
Genomic DNA and total RNA will be extracted from tumor samples using a Qiagen All -prep kit. 
For individual target genes that are recurrently mutated in DLBCL (CARD11, CD79B, MYD88, 
EZH2), classical Sanger sequencing will be performed on PCR amplicons, using primers 
surrounding the known sites of mutation. To broadly assess mutations, next generation sequencing 
(e.g., on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform) will be employed, using a paired end sequencing 
strategy of libraries constructed from tumor DNA. DNA will either be sequenced in its entirety 
from a whole genome library or will be first enriched for exonic seque nces using the Agilent Sure 
Select system, aiming for 30X or 100X average coverage per base, respectively. The sequence 
fragments will be mapped back to the genome using the BWA algorithm. Of sequences 
overlapping a particular base pair in the genome, the percent mutant calls greater that 20% with a 
minimum of 25X coverage will be considered as an arbitrary threshold for single nucle otide 
variants (SNVs). SNVs that are not present in the matched normal sample will be considered 
candidate somatic mutations.  
A related technology, RNA -Seq, utilizes RNA from the tumor specimen to create a cDNA library 
for high -throughput sequencing. RNA -seq will be performed using Illumina kits followed by high -
throughput sequencing on an Illumina HighSeq 2000 machine. The cuto ffs for coverage and 
percent mutant calls mentioned above will also be used to identify putative SNVs. RNA 
sequencing will also be  used to read out digital gene expression across the genome as described.  
5.3.6 DNA Copy Number Analysis  
Array comparative genomic hybridization (e.g., on Agilent 240K or Affy SNP 6.0 microarrays) 
will be used to assess DNA copy number alterations as described,  in tumor DNA to yield 
somatically acquired regions of copy number gain and loss.  
5.3.7 Other Analyses  
Other analyses include the fo llowing:  
• Cell analysis and histological (e.g., H&E), immunohistochemical review and analysis per 
standard and established research techniques (e.g., PD -1/PD -L1 expression [Dako], FISH 
for 9p24 amplicon, and other IHC analyses in blood and tissue).  
• Cytokine  analysis (e.g., IL -6, IL -10, interferon beta, TNF -alpha)  
• cfDNA/ctDNA for liquid genotyping as a non -invasive dynamic monitoring of disease as 
well as monitoring for individual molecular aberrations that herald progression or disease 
transformation; specif ically, amplification and sequencing of the VDJ segment of the 
immunoglobulin receptor is planned  
5.3.8 Future Use  
Any blood, tissue, or other (e.g., CSF) products or portions leftover from other analyses will be 
stored for future research.

43 5.4 SAMPLE STORAGE , TRACKING AND DISPOSITION  
5.4.1 General  
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Manage ment system .  
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed .  Samples 
will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if required . 
All specimens obtain ed in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens that are 
remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the c onditions described below.  The 
study will remain open so long as  sample or data analysis continues.  Samples from consenting 
patients will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent 
for their continued use, at  which time they will be destroyed.   
If the patient withdraws consent his/her data will be excluded from future distributions, but dat a 
that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be able to be retrieved.  
The PI will r ecord any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples as a deviation. Reporting will 
be per the requirements of Section  7.2.1 . 
5.4.2 Developmental Thera peutics Branch  (Trepel Lab)  
Under the direction of Dr. Trepel, a ll samples processed by  the Developmental Therapeutics 
Branch  Laboratory will be uniquely barcoded , with data entered using a secure computerized 
database and backup hardcopy process per stand ard laboratory practice .  
Samples are stored in labeled boxe s in secured  freezer s (i.e., -20ºC to -80ºC , or other, as 
appropriate)  according to stability requirements; t hese freezers are located onsite .  Access to stored  
clinical samples is restricted and limited to research personnel for approved analyses only ( as per 
the IRB approved protocol ). 
Upon completion of planned analyses by th e Trepel lab, leftover samples may be stored for future 
analyses at the Clinical Support Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.in Frederick, MD  
(see below).   
5.4.3 Clinical Pharmaco logy Program (Figg Lab)  
5.4.3.1  Sample Data  Collection  
All samples sent to the Blo od Processing Core (BPC) of the Clinical Pharmacology 
Program under the direction of Dr. Figg will be barcoded, with data entered and stored 
in the Labmatrix utilized by the BPC. This is a secure program, with access to Labmatrix  
limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. 
Installation of Labmatrix  is limited to computers specified by Dr. Figg. These computer s 
all have a password restricted login screen. All Figg lab personnel with  access to patient 
information annually complete the NIH online Protection of Human Subjects course.  
Labmatrix  creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, w hich cannot 
be traced back to patients without Labmatrix  access. T he data recorded for each sample 
includes the patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, 
dose, material type, as well as box and freezer location. Pa tient demographics associated 
with the clinical center patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there 
are notes associated with the processing method (delay in sample processing, storage 
conditions on the ward, etc.).

Version Date:  03/05/2021  
44 5.4.3.2  Sample Storage  
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer s at appropr iate 
temperatures (e.g., -20ºC to -80ºC ) according to stability requirements.  These freezers 
are located onsite in the BPC and offsite at NCI Frederick Central Repository Services 
in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied  by laboratory 
staff at all times.  
Acce ss to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by 
a researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix . 
All researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are  only to be used for 
research purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that 
any unused samples must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI 
Principal Investigator  to ensure that the samples requested ar e being used in a manner 
consistent with IRB approval.  
Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. 
This information will only be provided to investigators listed on this proto col, via 
registered use of the Labmatrix . It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient 
information such as race, age, dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information 
about the tumor, in order to correlate genotype with these variables.  
5.4.4 Hematopathology Section of La boratory of Pathology (Tissue samples)  
Archival and/or freshly collected and processed tumor tissue may be stored in the 
Hematopathology Section of Laboratory of Pathology until ready for planned and/or future  
resear ch assays if the patient has agreed to a llowing specimens to be used in future research studies.  
IRB approval will be obtained before using any samples to conduct studies that are not described 
within this protocol.  Samples will be stored under condition s appropriate to the type of sample 
and processing (e.g., ambient or frozen).   
Tissue that is given to the technician will be assigned an accession number (HP#) in the HP Case 
Log book ; sample tracking also takes place with a FileMaker Pro data base  calle d HP Patient 
Information and Specimen In ventory.    A Patient background sheet may be filled out and filed  with 
any accompanying paperwork, with final reports and any supplemental reports that follow added 
as completed .  
5.5 SAMPLES FOR GENETIC /GENOMIC  ANALYSIS  
5.5.1 Description of the scope of genetic/gen omic analysis  
The research correlates for this study are expected to include DNA/RNA sequencing of tumors, 
including circulating tumor (ct) DNA.  In addition, whole exome sequencing may include 
evaluation for known l ymphoma mutations.  For any genetic stud ies performed, the results will be 
deposited in a database such as dbGaP per NIH requirements.  Although there is controlled access 
to such a database, such a submission carries theoretical risks of revealing the ide ntity of the 
subject.  This is discussed  in the consent.  
5.5.2 Description of how privacy and confidentiality of medical information/biological 
specimens will be maximized  
Confidentiality for genetic samples will be maintained as described (Section  5.2.1 ).  In addition, a 
Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained for this study.

45 5.5.3 Management of Results  
Subjects  will be contacted if a clinically actionable gene variant is discovered.  Cli nically 
actionable findings  for this study are defined as disorders appearing in the American College of 
Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for the return of incidental findings that is 
current at the time of primary analysis. (A list of current  guidelines is maintained o n the CCR 
intranet: https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/CCRCRO/Incidental+Findings+Lists ). 
5.5.4 Genetic C ounseling  
Subjects  will be cont acted with a request to provide a blood sample to be sent to a CLIA certified 
laboratory.  If the research findings are verified in the CLIA certified lab, the subject will be offered 
the opportunity to come to NIH  to have geneti c education and counseling to explain this result; at 
the time of any such event(s), these activities will be funded by the NCI/CCR in consideration of 
the specific circumstances.  If the subject does not want to come  to NIH, a referral to a local genetic 
healthcare provider will be  provided (at their expense) . 
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No 
interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis.  
6 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION   
6.1 DATA COLLECTION  
The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into an in -house password protected 
electronic system (C3D) and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness.  The Principal 
Investigator, associate investigators/research nurs es and/or a contracted data manager will assist 
with the data management efforts.    Primary  and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that 
research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant.    
All adverse events , including clinically significant abno rmal findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, w ill be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event.     
Document AEs from the first study intervention, Study Day 1, through 30  days after the last dose 
of the study treatment  
Adverse eve nts that are serious need to be recorded through 90 days. Beyond or, for SAEs, 30 days 
after the last intervention, only adverse events which are serious and related to the study 
intervention need to be recorded.  
End of study procedures: Data wi ll be store d according to HHS, FDA regulations, and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable.  
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach  in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred , this will  be reported expeditiously per 
requirements in section 7.2.1 .

47 6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Response rate of pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory gray -zone lymphomas (GZL) 
and extranodal  diffuse large B -cell lymphomas (DLBCL)  will be assessed according to the 
International Working  Group (IWG ) response criteria and the International PCNSL workshop 
response criteria.  In addition, we will also look at overall response rate according to the 5 -point 
Lugano classification for interpreting FDG -PET scans.  
When appropriate , for patient s with disease involvement of the bone marrow at baseline, repeat 
assessment will be done to confirm response.   
6.3.1 Response C riteria for L ymphoma  Lymphoma  – GZL and DLBCL (not PCNSL)  
The following will be used to assess response in subjects with GZL and extranod al ABC, wit h the 
exception of PCNSL  (see Section 6.3.2 ).   
6.3.1.1  International Working Group (IWG ) response criteria

6.3.1.2  The Five-Point S cale (5 -PS) Deauville crit eria 
The five -point scale (5 -PS) has been validated for use at interim staging and at the end of treatment 
and was adopted as the preferred reporting method at the First International Workshop on PET in 
Lymphoma in Deauville, France (i.e., De auville criter ia), and in several international trials.  
The 5 -PS scores the most intense uptake in a site of initial disease:  
1. if present, as follows: no uptake or no residual uptake (when used at interim)  
2. slight uptake, but below blood pool (mediastinum)  
3. uptake above me diastinal, but below or equal to uptake in the liver  
4. uptake slightly to moderately higher than liver  
5. markedly increased uptake or any new lesion (on response evaluation)

NOTE:   It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s ring or extranodal  sites with high physiologic uptake or 
with activation within spleen or marrow (e.g., wi th chemotherapy or myeloid colony -stimulating 
factors), uptake may be greater than normal mediastinum and/or liver. In this circumstance, complete

Lymph nodes and 
extralymphatic sites  Score 4 or 5† with reduced uptake 
compared with baseline and residual 
mass(es) of any size  
At interim, these fi ndings suggest 
responding disease . 
At end of treatment, these findings indicate 
residual disease . • ≥50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 target 
measurea ble nodes and extranodal sites  
 
When a lesion is too small to measure on CT, assign 5

beyond normal  
New lesions  None  None  
Bone marrow  Residual uptake higher than uptake in 
normal marrow but reduced compared 
with baseline (diffuse uptake 
compatible with reactive changes from 
chemotherapy  allowed). If there are 
persistent focal changes in the marrow 
in the context of a nodal response, 
consideration should  be given to 
further evaluation with MRI  or biopsy  
or an interval scan . Not applicable

*A score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especially if at the time of an inter im 
scan. However, in trails involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider a  score of 3 as 
inadequate response (to avoid under treatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes, nodal 
masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in 2 diameters. Nodes should preferably be from 
disparat e regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal 
lesions include those in solid org ans (eg, liver spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those 
noted on palpation. Nonme asured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable 
disease should be considered not measured. These si tes include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected 
as dominant or measurable or that do not m eet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as 
well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected d isease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with 
measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, b one lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other 
lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by imaging. In Waldeyer’s ring o r in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, 
bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response, but should be no 
higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activation as a result of chem otherapy of myeloid 
growth factors).

6.3.3 Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progre ssion/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
6.3.4 Duration of  Response  
The duration of response  (DOR)  is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR 
or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progres sive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started) , death, or, in the absence of PD, date of last assessment .  
6.3.5 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from the date of study enr ollment 
until time of disease relapse, d isease progression , or death, whichever occurs first.  
6.3.6 Event -Free Survival  
Event -free survival  (EFS) is defined as the duration of time from the date of study enrollment until 
time of disease relapse, disease progress ion, alternative therapy for lymphoma gi ven (such as 
radiation ), or death, whichever occurs first.  
6.3.7 Other

51 Evaluable for objective response :  Only those patients who have measurable or evaluable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least two doses of therapy, and have had their disease re -
evaluated with radiographic ima ging will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients 
will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (NOTE:  Patients 
who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)

immediately to Merck Global Safety.   
NOTE:  These same reporting requirements a nd windows apply to Events of 
Clinical Interest (see Section 8.1.4 ).    
All patients  with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome.   
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the Merck Global 
Safety facsimile  number:  +1 -215-993-1220 .  See APPENDIX B for the specific criteria and 
categories of information that require documentation and reporting to Merck with each event.   
8.1.3 Serious Adverse Events  
In addition to the serious adverse events l isted in Section 7.1.1  , the following are also required to 
be reported as “serious” events to Merck:  
• Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)  
• Is associated with an overdose  (see additional informatio n in Section 8.1.4.1 ) 
8.1.4 Reporti ng Requirements for Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) 
and must be reported within  2 worki ng days to Merck Global Safety.  (Attn: Worldwide Product 
Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) . 
All ECI reporting time frames are indicated above in Section 8.1.2 .   
8.1.4.1  Overdose of a Merck Product  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg 
or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose)  and is a reportable event of special interest .  No specific 
information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab . Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  In the event of overdose, the subject should 
be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Approp riate supportive treatment should be provided if 
clinically indicated.  
If an adverse e vent(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck product , the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness cri teria are 
met. 
If a dose of Merck’s product  meeting the protocol definition of overdos e is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non -
serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose 
without adverse effect.”  
8.1.4.2  Liver Functio n Tests (LFTs)  
An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal 
and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal 
and, at the same time, an alkaline phospha tase lab value t hat is less than 2X the upper limit of 
normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory 
testing , are also to be reported as events of clinical interest to Merck in an expedited fashion.  
NOTE:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of 
the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional 
evaluation for an underlying etiology .

54 8.1.4.3  Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactati on to Merck  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously 
reported to them) that occurs during the trial.  
Pregnancies and la ctations that occur from the t ime of treatment allocation  through 120 days 
following cessation of pembrolizumab , or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject 
initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be repo rted by the inve stigator.  All 
reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy 
outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, 
fetal death, intrauterine death, misc arriage and stil lbirth must be reported as serious events 
(Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) 
must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety.  (Attn : Worldwide 
Prod uct Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220)  
8.1.5 Protocol -Specific Exceptions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to Merck as described in Section 
8.1.2 , unless there is evidence suggestin g a causal relationship between the drug and the event.  
Any such event will be submitted to Merck Global Safety within 2 working days either by 
electronic or paper media.  
Specifically, the suspected/actual eve nts covered in this exception include any even t that is disease 
progression of the cancer under study . 
The PI will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure the 
safety of the patients in the trial.  Any suspected endpo int which upon review is not progression 
of th e cancer under study will be forwarded to Merck Global Safety as a SAE within 2 working 
days of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study.   
In addition, hospitalization related to convenience (e.g., transportation issues et c.) will not be 
considered a SAE or a Protocol Deviation.  
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS    
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS  
• Primary Endpoint :  
o Overall response rate (ORR) ; this will be assessed at up to 24 months.   
• Secondar y Endpoints:  
o Type, grade, and frequency of toxicities  
o Duration of response  
o Progression -free survival (PFS)  
o Event -free survival (EFS)  
o Overall survival (OS)  
NOTE:  Each of the above will be assessed definitively when 24 months have passed 
since the  last pati ent has been enrolled.

55 9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
The trial will be conducted in two cohorts using a single stage design for evaluati ng efficacy in 
each cohort sin ce modestly high clinical response rates are expected in both cohorts.  
In the GZL cohort, res ults from a prior study indicate that 3 of 3 patients had a complete response 
when treated with (authors data, manuscript accepted for publication).  W ith 20 evaluable patients, 
there would be 91% power to rule out 50% and be consistent with 80% who may be  able to 
experience a clinical response , using an exact binomial test with a 0.10 one -sided significance 
level.  As an illustration, if 2 0 evaluable patients are enrolled, 14 of 20 (70.0%) who experience a 
clinical response  would have an associated one -sided lower 90% confidence interval bound of 
53.3%, and simultaneously an associated one -sided upper 90% confidence interval bound of 
83.4%.  This demonstrate s that 14 responses in 20  patients would be a desirable result based on 
the parameters selected.  
In the PCNSL and extranodal  DLBCL cohort, newly published results in 5 patients suggest the 
overall response rate will be moderately high.38  With 20 evaluable patients, there would be 88% 
power to rule out 40% and be consistent with 70% who may be able to experience a clinical 
response , using an exact binomial test with a 0.10 one -sided significance level.  As an illustration, 
if 20 evaluable patients are enrolled, 12 of 20 (60.0%) who experi ence a clinical response  would 
have an associated one -sided lower 90% confidence interval bound of 43.3%, and simultaneously 
an associated one -sided upper 90% confidence interval bound of 75.1%.  This demonstrates that 
12 responses in 20 patients would be a desirable result based on the parameters selected.  
Within the PCNSL and extranodal  DLBCL cohor t, the goal wi ll be to enroll a total of 10 PC NSL 
patients and 10 extranodal  DLBCL patients.  By doing so, at the conclusion of the trial, there will 
potentiall y be adequate patients to make an approximate estimate of the response rate for each 
group, whic h could provide information that may guide future development in these patient 
subsets.   While 20 patients may be needed for evaluation per cohort, in order to allow for a small 
number of inevaluable patients, we intend to initiate treatment in 48 eligible  subjects.  In order to 
also account for ineligible patients (i.e., screen failures who do not initiate treatment), the accrual 
ceiling will be set at 52 patien ts.  If 18 -20 patients may be accrued onto this trial per year, accrual 
should  be completed with in 2 to 2.5 years.  
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
All patients who receive at least 2 doses of pembrolizumab, and who have both a baseline and 
follow -up scan at the a ppropriate time to assess response will be considered evaluable and included 
in the analyses.  
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
9.4.1 General Approach  
The response rate will be determined and reported along with a 95% confidence interval. Other 
time-to-event outcomes will be  reported using Kaplan -Meier curves .   
9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoints  
The ORR in each cohort will be determined and reported along with a 95% confidence interval .

Version Date:  03/05/2021  
56 9.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints  
The duration of response (DOR; beginning at the date c linical response is first identified), overall 
survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), and progression free survival (PFS) will be estimated for 
each of the two types of lymphoma individually using Kaplan -Meier curves with appropriate 
confidence interval s reported . 
9.4.4 Safety Analyses  
The type, grade and frequency of toxicities will be reported . 
9.4.5 Planned Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned because of the single stage design of the trial .   
9.4.6 Sub-Group Analyses  
None . 
9.4.7 Tabulation of I ndividual Particip ant Data  
None . 
9.4.8 Exploratory Analyses  
The exploratory objectives such as seeking to identify potential biomarkers or T -cell and B -cell 
clones in peripheral blood which are associated with response, will be assessed using descriptive 
statistics as well as non -parametric methods such as exact Wi lcoxon rank sum tests. The analyses 
will be done without formal adjustment for multiple comparisons, but in the context of the number 
of tests performed.   
10 COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS  
10.1 CLINICAL TRIAL AGREEMENT  
There will be  a CTA between the National Cancer I nstitute and Merck, Inc . (CTA #01043 -17)  A 
CRADA is also being discussed and will be added in an amendment, if finalized.   
11 HUMAN SUBJECTS  PROTECTIONS  
11.1 RATIONALE FOR SUBJECT SELECTION  
Gray -zone lymphomas (GZL) affect al l races and genders, but certain subsets such as mediastinal  
gray-zone lymphomas occur preferentially in young adults with a slight male predominance.  
Extranodal  DBCL and other ABC -like subtypes of DLBCL including PCNSL are more likely to 
occur i n older p atient s. Across both cohorts, we anticipate an even gender distribution. This trial 
is directed at assessing a novel therapy using single agent pembrolizumab in patients with either 
previously treated GZL and patients with previously treated extra nodal  DLB CL. Pregnant or 
nursing mothers are excluded because of the potential teratogenic effects of therap y. 
11.2 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
The original intent was for the study to include participation of children.  Specifically, that subjects 
who are at least 14 years old will be included because mediastinal gray zone lymphomas do 
occasionally affect younger age subjects and because there is no adequate treatment at this time.  
The age cut -off is based on the rarity of this disease in y ounger children.    
Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
57 However, gi ven the difficulty in recruitment and decision to close the study to accrual early, and 
that no children were enrolled to the study prior to the decision to close, children were ultimately 
not included.  Due to required protoco l updates at the request of th e NIH IRBO (made in early 
2021), the study was revised to note enrollment and inclusion of only adults in the study.   
11.3 PARTICIPATION OF SUBJECTS  UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT  
Adults who are unable to consent are included in this protocol because the protocol offe rs a 
prospect of direct benefit and should  therefore exclude participants only when scientifically 
necessary or participants with this condition are at risk of losing capacity at least temporarily and 
enrollment might be compromised without their involveme nt.   
In addition, r e-consent on this prot ocol may be necessary and there is a possibility that subjects 
could become decisionally impaired.  For this reason and because there is a prospect of direct 
benefit from research participation ( Section  11.4), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be  offered the 
opportunity to fill in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on 
the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Pa rticipation” form so that 
another person can make decisions about their medi cal care in the event that they become 
incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the study.   
NOTE: The PI or AI will contact the NIH Ability to Consent Assessment  Team (ACAT) for 
evaluation  to assess ongoing capacity of the subjects and to identify an LAR,  as needed .  Please 
see section 11.5 for consent procedure . 
11.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
Patients may obtain direct benefit from treatment with pembrolizumab. The most common adverse 
reactions (≥ 10%) observed in clinical trials were rash, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, cough , pruritus,  
dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite,  headache , vomiting, asthenia, pyrexia, back 
pain, anemia, peripheral edema  and constipation. Although the potential fo r serious adverse events 
exists for these patients, the incidence of them is decidedly  lower and management algorithms 
have been developed. The poten tial toxicity of pembrolizumab is reasonable in relation to the 
potential benefit to this group of patients  who have few treatment options.   The risks associated 
with research procedures (i.e., research blood and tissue collection, including planned analys es and 
risks associated with genetic research) are described in detail in the informed consent document.  
11.4.1  Risks 
11.4.1.1  Imaging  
In addition to the radiation risks discussed below, scans often use a contrast agent  and may include 
the risks of an allergic reaction t o the contrast. Participants might experience hives, itching, 
headache, difficulty breathing, increased heartrate and swelling.  
11.4.1.2  CT and PET scans  
CT and PET scans often use a contrast agent.  There is a sm all risk of having a reaction to the 
contrast and m ost often include nausea, pain in the vein where the contrast is given, headache, 
metallic and/ or bitter taste in the mouth and a warm, flushing feeling.  Rarely, some people have 
more severe allergic rea ctions to the contrast which may include skins rash es, shortness of breath, 
wheezing or low blood pressure.  
11.4.1.3  MRI  
People are at risk for injury from the MRI magnet if they have some kinds of metal in their body. 
People with fear of confined spaces may beco me anxious during an MRI. Those with back 

Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
58 problems may have back pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner.  The noise from the 
scanner is loud enough to damage hearing, especially in people who already have hearing loss.  
There are no known long -term r isks of MRI scans.  
11.4.1.4  Gadolinium enhanced MRI  (Require d in patients with PC NSL)  
During part of the MRI patient will receive gadolinium, a contrast agent, through an intravenous 
(IV) catheter (small tube). It will be done for research purposes.  
The risks of an IV catheter include bleeding, infection, or infla mmation of the skin and vein with 
pain and swelling. Participants undergoing gadolinium enhanced MRIs may also be at risk for 
kidney damage.  
Most of the gadolinium contrast is eliminated in t he urine. However, recent studies have found 
very small amounts o f residual gadolinium in the body, including the brain and bone, by imaging 
and at autopsy. Macrocyclic gadolinium -containing contrast agents are substantially less likely to 
leave gadolinium  behind than linear agents. There is presently no evidence that t he retained 
gadolinium is associated with any adverse effects or other health risks. Participants undergoing 
gadolinium enhanced MRIs may also be at risk for kidney damage.  
11.4.1.5  Radiation Exposure  
The procedures for performing the CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans wi ll follow clinical policies, 
no special procedures apply to these additional assessments for research purposes.  In summary, 
subjects may receive additional radiation exposure from up to five  (5) additional CT scans of the  
chest, abdomen, and pelvis  and t wo (2) additional 18F-FDG PET/CT  scans maximum in an annual 
period.  
The total additional radiation dose for research purposes will be approximately 7.9 rem.  This 
amount is more than would be expected from everyday background radiation . Being exposed to 
excess radiation can increase the risk of cancer.  
11.4.1.6  Blood sampling  
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting.  
11.4.1.7  Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy  
Bone marrow biopsy is minimally invasive and is typically a ve ry safe procedure. Usually hipbone 
is numbed with anest hesia. Using a needle, the solid and liquid portion of bone marrow is taken 
out. This procedure causes some pain. Very rarely, infection or bleeding may occur at the needle 
site. 
11.4.1.8  Biopsy (optional)  
All care will be taken to minimize risks that may be incurr ed by tumor sampling. However, there 
are procedure -related risks (such as bleeding, infection, and injury) that will be explained fully 
during informed consent  
11.4.1.9  Urine collection  
There is no physical ris k involved with urine collection.  
11.4.1.10  Lumbar puncture  
Risks of lumbar puncture include headache, dizziness, infection, back  discomfort, minor radicular 
numbness and brainstem herniation.

There are no anticipate d long-term physical risks expected with the eye exams planned in patients 
in PCNSL.  
11.5 CONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
The informed consent document will be provided to the participant or consent designee(s)  as 
applicable  for review prior to consenting.  A designated study investigator will carefully explain 
the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the associated risks, discomforts  and benefits.  
In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time as is needed to review the document will be 
given, including an opportunity to discuss it with friends, family members and/or other advisors, 
and to ask questions of any designated study investigator. A signed informed consent document 
will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.  
The initial consent process as well as re -consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platfo rms) per discr etion of the 
designated study investigator and with the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  
Whether in person or remote, the privacy of the subject will be maintained. Consenting 
investigators (and participant/consent designee,  when in perso n) will be located in a private area 
(e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted remotely, the participant/consent designee 
will be informed of the private nature of the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a 
more priva te setting if needed .    
11.5.1  Consent Pro cess for Adults Who Lack Capacity to Consent to Research Participation  
For participants addressed in section 11.3, an LAR will be identified consistent with Policy 403 
and informed consent obtained from the LAR, as descr ibed in Section 11.5.  
11.6 INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES  
Both men and women and members of all races are eligible for this trial.  
12 REGULATORY AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS   
12.1 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended  or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to st udy participants, 
investigator, funding agen cy, and regulatory authorities.  If the study is prematurely terminated or 
suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study participants, the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and  will provide the reason(s) for the terminat ion or suspension.  
Study participants will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit 
schedule.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant , or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determinat ion that the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility  

Abbr eviated Title:  Pembro in R/R GZL and DLBCL  
Version Date:  03/05/2021  
60 Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed, and satisfy the sponsor  and IRB.  
12.2 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
The clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological  
specimen collection, documentation and completion.  An individualized quality management plan 
will be developed to describe the site’s quality management.  
Quality  control (QC) p rocedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
Following written  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical 
trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, documented 
(recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, Internat ional Conferenc e on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., 
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial relate d sites, source  data/documents, 
and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and 
regulatory authorities.  
12.3 CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, su ch as by the 
pharmaceutical industry, is critical.  Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of persons who have 
a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and 
managed. Furthermore, persons who hav e a perceived c onflict of interest will be required to have 
such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the design and conduct 
of this trial.  The study leadership in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute  has esta blished 
policie s and procedures for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will 
establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.  
12.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY  
Participant  confidentiality  and privacy is strictly held  in trust by the participating investigators, 
their staff, and the sponsor(s). This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological 
samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participa nts. Theref ore, 
the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized 
third party without prior written approval of the spon sor.  
All resea rch activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representative s of the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB), and/or regulatory agencies  may inspect all doc uments and 
records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records 
(office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participant s in this study. The clinical 
study site will permit access to such record s. 
The study pa rticipant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal 
use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location 
for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing  IRB, Institutional policies, or sponsor 
requirements .

61 Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, 
will be stored at the NCI CCR . This will not include the participant’s contact or ident ifying 
information. Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique 
study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by the 
clinical site (s) and by NCI CCR research staff will be sec ured and password pr otected. At the end 
of the study, all study databases will be archived at the NIH. 
To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality has been  issued 
by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This certificate protects  identifiable research 
information from forced disclosure. It allows the investigat or and others who have access to 
research records to refuse to disclose identifying information on research participation in any civil, 
criminal, administrative, legislative , or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local 
level. By protecting  researchers and institutions from being compelled to disclose information that 
would identify research participants, Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve the resear ch 
objectives and promote participation in studies by helping assure confidentialit y and privacy to 
participants.

68 16 APPENDIX B:  MERCK ADVERSE EVENT D OCUMENTAT ION R EQUIREMENTS  
The following information should be considered for each reportable event to Merck:  
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diag nostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi talization or prolongation or hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL.  
Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event is any adverse event occu rring at any dose or during any use of Merck product that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This doe s not include an adve rse event 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an  existing inpatient hospitalization  (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless  of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a 
precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to t reat a pre -existing condition that has not worsened is not a serious adverse 
event.  A pre -existing c ondition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a Merck product and is documented in the patient’s med ical history.); or  
 †Is a con genital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagno sis); or 
 Is a new cancer  (that is not a condition of the study)  (although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to Merck within 2 working days to  meet certain local requirements); 
or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event for  collection purposes. An overdose 
that is not associated with an adverse eve nt is considered a non -serious event of clinical inter est and must be reported to Merck within 2 working days.  
 Other important medical events  that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospitalization may be considered a seriou s adverse event when, based upon 
appropriate medical j udgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes  listed previously (designated 
above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, i ndicate the appropriate length of time and units  
Action taken  Did the adverse event cause Merck product to be discontinued?

69 Relationship to 
Merck Product  Did Merck product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that Merck product caused the adverse event will be provided by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted  on the AE form, ensures that a medically quali fied 
assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criter ia below are intended as reference guidelines to assist 
the investigator in ass essing the likelihood of a relationship between  the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between Merck product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective 
elements (i n number and/or intensity), the more likely Merck product caused the adverse event (AE):  
Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to Merck product such as: reliable history, acceptabl e compliance assessment (pill count, diary, 
etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of Merck product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a dru g-induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or  environmental factors  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (continued)  
Dechallenge  Was Merck product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improve d despite continuation of 
the study drug ; or (3) the  trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) study drug is only used one time.)  
Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to Merck product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative re challenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is  a single -dose drug trial); or (3) 
study drug is used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR A N ADVERSE E VENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED 
BY MERCK PRODUCT, OR IF REEXPOSURE TO MERCK PRODUCT  POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE 
SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY THE PI AS PER DOSE MODIFICA TION GUIDEL INES 
IN THE PROTOCOL.  
Consistency with Trial 
Treatment Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding Merck product or drug class pharmacology or 
toxicology?  
The assessment of relationship will b e reported on the case report forms /worksheets by an investigator who is a qualified physician according to his/her best cli nical judgment, including consideration 
of the above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be indicative of Merck product relationship).  
Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of 
Merck product relationship.  There is evidence of exposure to Merck product.  The temporal sequence of the AE onset relati ve to the administration of Merck product is reasonable.  
The AE is more likely explained by Merck product than by another cause.  
No, there is not a reasonable possibility of 
Merck product relationship  Subject did n ot receive the Merck product  OR temporal  sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of Merck product is not reasonable OR 
the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the Merck product.  (Also entered for a subject with overdose without a n associated AE.)

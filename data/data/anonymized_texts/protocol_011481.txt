1.1. Synopsis  
 
Title:  Wet Time for a Foam Hand Sanitizer with 70% ethyl alcohol  
 
Study Description:  Hand sanitizers are a standard of hygiene requirements. They must be 
effective at reducing germ count on the hands while ideally providing 
emollients to moisturize the skin aft er use. Spectrum ™ Advanced Hand 
Sanitizer Foam (70%)   (hereby referred to as Spectrum Advanced Foam)  kills 
over 99.99% of germs within 15 seconds while boasting double digit 
increases in hand moisture after two weeks of use.  
 
In 2002 and 2009 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) and 
World Health Organization  (WHO) published guidance that hands should 
remain wet for at least 15 seconds while being rubbed together after 
application of an alcohol -based hand rub, though the recommendations d o 
not specify the volume of product to be apply.  1, 2 
 
This study will evaluate  the “wet time ” of Spectrum Advanced Foam , which 
will be defined as the length of time in which the sanitizer foam stays wet  on 
the hands  while the participant rubs their hands with the foam sanitizer . The 
participant  will first be asked to wash an d dry their hands. Participants will 
review the appropriate hand sanitizer application steps, as detailed by  the 
WHO guidance. Then , a 1.0 mL  or 1.4 mL* aliquot of Spectrum Advanced 
Foam will be dispensed from an automated dispenser3 to the participant ’s 
hands . 1 The participant will be asked to rub their hands together following 
the WHO  method for hand sanitizer application until they declare the product 
has dried sufficiently for the donning of medical gloves . Study personnel will 
measure the wet time  of Spectrum Advanced foam  using a stopwatch.  
 
  
Phase:  
 Post-market.  
 
* The study is to include an interim analysis of the data after 46 participants have completed the study on the medium 
dispenser setting  (1.0 mL). If the results demonstrate a satisfactory 15 second wet time using the medium setting, the 
study will end and no further recruitment will take place. If at this point, the results demonstrate that the amount of 
hand sanitizer dispensed under the  medium setting (1.0 mL) does not sufficiently stay wet for at least 15 seconds, a 
second data collection will take place with another 46 participants who will undergo the study using the high dispenser 
setting (1.4 mL).

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Background & Rationale  
 
Hand sanitizers are a standard of hygiene requirements. They must be effective at reducing germ count 
on the hands while ideally providing emollients to moisturize the skin after use. In 2002 and 2009 the 
CDC  and WHO  published guidance s that hands should r emain wet for at least 15 seconds while being 
rubbed together after application of an alcohol -based hand rub, though the recommendations d o not 
specify the volume of product to be apply. 1, 2 
The CDC specifically recommends applying alcohol -based hand sani tizers by applying the 
manufacturer -recommended amount of sanitizer directly to the palm of one hand and then rubbing the 
hands together. The sanitizer must entirely cover the surfaces of both hands and all fingers while 
rubbing the hands together until th e product has dried.1 
 
The goal of this study is to evaluate the  “wet time ” of Spectrum Advanced Foam , which will be defined  
in this study  as the length of time in which the foam sanitizer  stays wet  on the hands  while the participant 
rubs their hands with the foam sanitizer . 
2.2. Study Products  
2.2.1.   Medline Spectrum ™ Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam (70%)   
Spectrum Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam  kills over 99.99% of germs within 15 seconds . 
The formula includes  added moisturizers  to help reduce dry skin.  The SKU number for 
Medline Spectrum Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam  is HH70F1000H .  
 
2.3. Risk/Benefit Profile  
2.3.1.  Potential Study Risks  
This study entails minimal risk to t he participants. Spectrum Advanced Foam is  
commercially available and widely used in clinical settings. There is the possibility of 
minor skin irritation with the application of Spectrum Advanced Foam , however the 
magnitude of this should be no greater than what occurs through the normal use of th e hand 
sanitizers . In addition, the study is designed such that the test product will be applied on 
the non -compromised skin of participants with no self-reported  known skin conditions, 
which should impose less risk for study participants.  
2.3.2.  Potential Study Benefits  
Direct benefit to the study participants is unlikely. However, the results from this study 
will provide the wet time for Spectrum Advanced Foam , which may better inform  product 
efficacy and  infection prevention for individuals applying Spectrum Advanced Foam  to the 
hands.

 Informed consent will be  obtained either in-person or remotely. Following  in-person or remote 
remote  participant screening, the participant will be asked to wash and dry their hands and wait an 
additional two minutes. The participants will review th e steps for hand sanitizer application, adapted 
from a WHO poster on application of handrubs. The participants will be i nstructed to apply a 1.0 mL 
or 1.4 mL * aliquot of Spectrum Advanced Foam to their hands. The Spectrum Advanced foam will 
be dispensed from an automated dispenser. The participant will then be asked to rub their hands 
together with the foam sanitizer until their hands are dry, following the WHO recommended method 
for hand sanitizer application. Study staff will use a stopwatch to measure the wet time: the 
application of the product to the palm of the participant will indicate the “start time”, and the 
partic ipant stating that their hands have dried will indicate the “stop time”.  
 
After the participant has indicated that their hands have dried  sufficiently for the donning of gloves , 
study staff will record the wet time of Spectrum Advanced Foam. The participa nt will then be 
dismissed from the study.  
 
 
4.2. End of Study Definition  
A participant will have complete d their study  participation  when all study activities are completed 
at the end of Visit 1.  
This study will be considered complete upon issuance of a Clinical Study Report that has been 
approved by the Clinical Affairs Director.  
5. STUDY POPULATION

meet the desired N = 46.  
6. STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
6.1. Visit 1  
6.1.1.  Informed consent  and screening  
6.1.1.1.   Informed Consent  
The study staff will  ob tain written informed consent from the participant  in-person or  over a 
video conference call with the participant. Written consent must be obtained from all 
participants and documented on an Informed Consent form (ICF) that has received  approval 
by an IRB/Ethics Committee. The ICF will be written in adherence to Good  Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and must comply with all elements required by United States (U.S.) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) 21 CFR 50.25 and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
4.8, state and local regulations, and additional elements releva nt to specific study situations 
(including a statement that Medline Industries, LP and relevant authorities have access to 
participant records). A copy of the signed consent will be provided for each participant.  
6.1.1.2.  Verification and Eligibility  
The PI or delegated study staff will verify the eligibility of the individual for the study, based 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria that will be evaluated in the Participant Screening Form. 
Participant demographics (age and sex), as well as hand size, will be documented. Study staff 
will verify participant eligibility in the study  in-person or  over a video conference call with the

 participant. The participant will receive a unique screening number that will be recorded in the 
Participant Screening Form. The participant resp onses will be included in the Participant 
Screening Form.  
Successfully enrolled participants will be assigned a unique participant identification number 
based on the order in which they enroll. If the individual  is considered eligible to participate in 
the study, the participant will proceed to the  study  activiti es detailed in section  6.1.2 . 
6.1.2.   Hand Sanitizer Application  
 
Participants will first be asked to wash and dry their hands and wait an additional two minutes 
after their hands have dried before application of the hand sanitizer products. Study staff will 
record that the participant has washed their hands and waited a n additional two minutes in the 
Case Report Form (CRF). The participants will then review the hand sanitizer application steps  
detailed in Figure 1 , which are  adapted from the WHO  “How to Handrub?” poster . 4

The participants will then be instructed by study staff to apply a 1.0 mL or 1.4 mL * aliquot of  
Spectrum Advanced Foam to their hands , which will be provided from an automated dispenser , 
following the hand sanitizer application steps.  Study staff will begin to measure the wet time 
using a calibrated stopwatch: the application of the product to the palm of the participant will 
indica te the “start time”, and the participant stating that their hands have dried will indicate the 
“stop time”.  
 
Once the participant has indicated that their hands are dry  enough to don medical gloves , study 
staff  will stop the stopwatch and record the Spectrum Advanced Foam wet time in the CRF.  
 
6.1.3.   Participant Dismissal   
After the study staff has recorded the wet time of Spectrum Advanced Foam in the CRF, the 
participant will be dismissed from the stu dy.  
7. ADVERSE EVENTS (AEs)  
7.1. Definition of AE   
The FDA definition for an AE is: An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or 
procedur e that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.  
However, a  narrower definition of AE will be used for this study. In this study, an AE is any untoward 
medical occurrence related to the topical use of the hand sanitizers d uring this study,  including  skin 
itching, erythema, edema, or any other skin irritation that occurs.  
7.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
The FDA definition of a SAE will be used in this study: An AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered "serious" if, in the view of the PI it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event,  
• Inpatient hospitalization o r prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or

 __________ _____________  
* The study is to include an interim analysis of the data after 46 participants have completed the study on the medium 
dispenser setting (1.0 mL). If the results demonstrate a satisfactory 15 second wet time using the medium setting, the 
study will end and no further recruitment will take place. If at this point, the results demonstrate that the amount of 
hand sanitizer dispensed under the medium setting (1.0 mL) does not sufficiently stay wet for at least 15 seconds, a 
second data collection will take place  with another 46 participants who will undergo the study using the high dispenser 
setting (1.4 mL).  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be 
considered  serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
All SAEs will be reported to Medline, regardless of poten tial relationship to the study product(s). SAEs  
will be reported to the reviewing IRB as necessary according to their reporting requirements.  
7.3. Severity of AE  
The severity of all AEs will be graded on a scale of one through five according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for AE guideline, where each grade represents a unique clinical description based 
on this general guideline:  
• Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation 
only; intervention not indicated.  
• Grad e 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limited age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.  
• Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospital ization indicated; disabling; limiting 
activities of daily living involving self -care.  
• Grade 4:  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5:  Death related to AE  
7.4. Relatedness of AE and SAE  
 
• Unrelated:  This category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.)  
• Possible:  This category applies to those AEs for which, after careful medical 
consideration at th e time they are evaluated, a connection with the Investigational 
Product administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  
• Probable:  This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are ev aluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to 
be related to the study product(s).  
• Definite:  This category applies to those AEs  which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to the study product(s).

 7.5. Expectedness  
The PI will  be responsible for determining whether an AE or SAE is expected or unexpected. An AE 
will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk information previously described for the study interventi on.  
7.6. AE Reporting  
The AEs will be recorded on the AE form (provided by Medline Industries, LP) by the study staff and 
reviewed by the PI. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity. Changes in severity will necessitate a new CRF to 
document the new level of severity. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset 
and duration of each episode.  
Non-serious AEs will be reported to the IRB per IRB reporting requirements.  
7.7. SAE Reporting  
The PI shall complete an SAE Form (provided by Medline Industries, LP) and  will be responsible for 
reporting the event to the IRB, if applicable, per the IRB’s reporting requirements. The PI is responsible 
for conducting an eval uation of the SAE and shall report the results of such evaluation to the FDA and 
to all reviewing IRBs, if applicable, within 10 working days after the  PI first receives notice of the 
effect. Thereafter, the PI shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA requests.

8.       INTERIM ANALYSES  
The study is to include an interim analysis of the data after 46 participants have completed the study on 
the medium dispenser setting (1.0 mL). If at this point, the results demonstrate that the amount of hand 
sanitizer dispensed under the medium setting (1.0 mL) does not sufficiently stay wet for at an average of 
at least 15 seconds, a second data collection whereby another 46 participants will undergo the study using 
the high dispenser setting (1.4 mL) will take place. If the results demonstrate a satisf actory average 15 
second wet time using the medium setting (1.0 mL) with 46 participants, the study results will be 
analyzed and it will be decided if an additional study using the 1.4 ml setting is warranted.

 9.      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1.   Sample Size Determination  
The sample size of 46 was estimated for 95% confidence interval based on a standard deviation of 5 seconds 
and target distance from mean to limits of 1.5 seconds (PASS -Confidence Intervals for One Mean). Results 
from a previous  study conducted by Ecolab (summarized in the Appendix) was utilized as a starting point 
sample size estimation for the current protocol, using PASS 2021 Power Analysis and Sample Size 
Software (2021). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA, ncss.com/software/pas s. In the event that a participant 
withdraws from the study, additional participants will be enrolled to achieve a final number of 46 
participants with complete data and until adequate power for analysis has been reached.  
                                                                    
9.2.   Randomization  
No randomization is planned at this time.  
9.3.   Populations for Analyses  
The analyses will be performed on the intent to treat (ITT) population which consists of all subjects who 
participated in the study, meaning they have full data on all covariates as well as the hand sanitizer dry 
time.  
No per protocol, safety, or other an alyses groups are planned.  
9.4 Protocol Deviations  
The list of protocol deviations will be compiled prior to database lock.  All deviations will be reviewed 
and decisions for handling each of the deviations will be made prior to the start of data analysis.  
9.5. Endpoints  
 9.5.1. Primary Endpoint   
The time during which 1.0 mL of Spectrum Advanced Hand Sanitizer Gel with Aloe Vera and Vitamin E 
remains wet under conventional use conditions.  
  
9.5.2. Secondary Endpoint   
None . 
9.6. Demographics, Variables and Covariates  
 Age will be collected as a continuous measure, with all participants being >=18 years of age.  Age strata 
will be defined as stratum 1: 18 -25 years old, stratum 2: 26 -41 years old, stratum 3: 42 -57 years old, 
stratum 4: 58 -67 year s old, stratum 5: 68 -76 years old, stratum 6: 77 -94 years old, 95+ years old.  Age 
will be considered for secondary analysis.

Sex will be collected as a categorical equal to 0=male, 1=female, or 2=other.  Sex will be considered for 
secondary analysis.  
  
Hand size will be calculated using the formula 2.48 x hand length x hand breadth as described by 
(Wilkinson et al. (2017), Bellissimo -Rodrigues et al. (2015) and Hsu and Yu (2010)).    
  
 
9.7. Handling of Missing Values  
All missing data will be quantified in the final report and possible biases for any missing data will be 
reported.  
 
9.8. Statistical Analysis  
Statistical analyses will be conducted in SAS® software, Version 9.4 or higher of the SAS System for 
Windows (Copyrigh t © 2013 SAS Institute Inc.) or other appropriate statistical software. P<0.05 will be 
considered statistically significant.  
All continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: (non -missing 
sample size), mean, standard d eviation, median, maximum and minimum.  The frequency and percentages 
(based on the non -missing sample size) of observed levels will be reported for all categorical measures.  
95% confidence intervals will be calculated for all means.   
A box -and-whisker p lot will be employed to display the mean, interquartile range, range, and any possible 
outliers for wet -to-dry time.    
 Spearman correlation analysis will be used to examine possible associations between the key variable of 
dry time with age, sex, and han d size. Additional t -tests or non -parametric tests will be employed to 
further examine any significant associations found in the correlational analyses between key and covariate 
measures.   
If the results of the interim analysis of 46 participants on the m edium dispenser setting (1.0 mL) does not 
demonstrate that hands stay sufficiently stay wet for at an average of at least 15 seconds, a second data 
collection whereby another 46 participants will undergo the study using the high dispenser setting (1.4 
mL) will take place.  All analyses presented above would then be repeated for the data from an additional 
46 participants at the high dispenser setting (1.4 m L).

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 5 Period , while on a self-reported stable, heart -healthy  diet. 
STUDY DESIGN:  
Pre-Screening  (Wash- Out Period ): A Wash-Out P eriod will be required for potential subjects  
taking any lipid -regulating therapies or supplements, with the exception of statins or ezetimibe 
10 mg QD . For subjects requiring a Wash-Out P eriod, the Pre -Screening Visit will be their first 
study visit  and will occur anywhere from 4 to 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (S1, Week - 4) 
based on the type of lipid- regulating therapy and its associated duration of wash-out required.  
Subjects  currently taking lipid -altering medications such as: niacin > 200 mg/day, fibrates, 
prescription or over -the-counter fish oil or other products containing omega- 3 fatty acids (OMG-
3), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, or 
other herbal products or dietary supplements with potential lipid -altering effects, must be able to 
safely discontinue therapy at the Pre-S creening  Visit. The duration of the Wash-Out P eriod will 
be dependent upon the status of the subject ’s current lipid -regulating therapy. Specifically, 
PCSK9 inhibitors will require an 8 -week Wash-Out P eriod, fibrates will require a 6 -week Wash-
Out Period, and niacin, OMG- 3 compounds, bile acid s equestrants or other lipid- regulating 
therapies will require a 4 -week Wash-Out P eriod prior to the Screening Visit.  If the subject 
needs to be washed off more than one lipid -altering medication; the medication that requires the 
longest Wash-Out P eriod will be the default.  For example, if a subject is taking OMG -3 and 
fibrates, then the subject would undergo a six -week Was-Out Period.  Exception : if a potential 
subject  is statin -naïve, or dosing only on a statin or ezetimibe  (for at least 12 weeks) and not 
currently dosing on other lipid -altering medications, there is no requirement for a Pre -Screening 
Visit.  
The Wash-Out P eriod will only be initiated after inclusionary lab values are received and 
reviewed.  During this Wash-Out P eriod, potential subjects will be counseled on the importance 
of maintaining a heart -healthy diet and limiting alcohol intake.  
Screening  Period : This is the TG qualifying period. All potential subjects  will participate in the 
Screening Period, including Screening Visit 1 (S1), Screening Visit 2 (S2) and, if necessary as 
outlined below, optional Screening Visit 3 (S3)  up to 28 days prior to Study Day 1  (Visit T1) . 
For potential subjects  on stable statin and/or ezetimibe therapy for ≥ 12 weeks and who do not 
require a Wash-Out P eriod, S 1 will be their first study visit.  For other subjects who have been 
washing out their other lipid medications, S1 occurs after the full required washout has been 
completed.  
During this Screening Period, potential subjects mus t meet the TG qualif ying values to be 
eligible for randomization  on Day 1 (Visit T1). 
The screening visits can be completed up to 28 days but not less than 14 days prior to T1 (Day 
1).  The visits are provided with recommended timepoints; however the minimum time between 
visits can be as short as 1 week with the Screening Period as short as 14 days for qualification 
with S1 and S2 visits or 21 days for qualification with S2 and S3. At the end of this 2-4-week 
diet and lifestyle stabilization and TG qualifying period, eligible  subjects  must have an average 
fasting TG level ≥ 500 mg/dL to < 1500 mg/dL to qualify for randomization into the 12- week 
double -blind treatment period. The TG level for qualification will be based on the average

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 6 (arithmetic mean) of the Visit S1 and Visit  S2 values. If a subject 's average TG level from Visit 
S1 and Visit S2 falls outside the required range for entry into the study, one additional sample 
for fasting TG value can be collected 1 week later  (at the Optional Visit S3), and the arithmetic 
mean from Visits S2 and S3 will then  be used to determine eligibility.    
Double -Blind Treatment Period:  After confirmation of qualifying fasting TG values  and all 
other inclusion and exclusion criteria , eligible subjects  will be randomized and enter a 12 -week, 
double- blind treatment period. At Visit T1, 90 eligible subjects  will be randomized via an 
interactive web/voice response system (IWRS/IVRS) on Study Day 1 in a 1:1:1  ratio (30 
subjects  per group) to one of the following treatment groups:  
• Gemcabene 300 mg QD, or  
• Gemcabene 600 mg QD, or  
• Placebo  
Subjects  will be stratified by baseline statin therapy  (yes or no)  and qualifying TG value ( < 880  
mg/dL or ≥ 880 mg/dL) to ensure background therapies and baseline TG values are balanced 
across all treatment groups.   
The primary evaluation of efficacy will be at End of Study (EOS)  (using the average of Week 10 
[T4] and Week 12 [T 5]).  The Follow -up Visit (telephone call) will occur 4 weeks (±  3 days) 
after the last dose of study drug.  
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Study drug will be double- blinded and prepared in bottles with 30 days  of dosing contained 
within each bottle .  The subjects  will be asked to take one tablet from each of the 2 bottles for a 
total of 2 tablets per day as outlined below: 
• 300 mg: 30 gemcabene tablets  in one bottle + 30 matching placebo tablet in a second bottle  
• 600 mg: 2 bottles each containing 30 300 mg gemcabene tablets  
• Placebo: 2 bottles each containing 30 placebo tablets.  
The first dose of study drug will be administered at the site on Study Day 1. On days with a 
scheduled office visit with blood sample collection, subject  will remain fasted and should not 
take gemcabene until after the blood samples are collected  at the si te.  On all other days , the 
subject  will self-dose: taking study drug at the same time in the morning with a full glass 
(approximately 8 ounces) of water either with or without food. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  
Sample Size  
Approximately 90 subjects (30 subjects per treatment group) will be randomized into 1 of 3 
treatment groups: gemcabene 300 mg, gemcabene 600 mg or placebo.  
A sample size of 30 randomized subjects  in the gemcabene 300 mg group, 30 randomized 
subjects  in the 600 mg group and 30 randomized subjec ts in the placebo group is expected to

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 7 provide 80% power to detect a difference of 35% in the percent change in TG from baseline to 
End of Study ( EOS) between either of the gemcabene treatment group s and the placebo group.  
This calculation is based on a 2 -sided t -test at the 5% level of significance (α = 0.05), a common 
standard deviation of 43, and a drop -out rate of 15%.   
Subject  Populations 
Full Analysis Set : The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all randomized subjects  who 
receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 post -baseline efficacy assessment. The 
FAS population will be the primary analysis population. All efficacy analyses will be performed 
on the FAS population.  
Per Protocol Set : The Per Protocol S et (PPS) will include all FAS subjects who complete the 12-
week Treatment Period without major protocol deviations. The PPS will be used to assess 
robustness of the analysis results. Protocol deviations will be reviewed and the PPS will be 
determined prio r to database lock.  
Safety Analysis Set : The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) will include all randomized subjects  who 
receive at least 1 dose of study drug. All safety analyses will be conducted on SAS . 
EFFICACY ENDPOINTS AND ANALYSIS:  
Primary Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in fasting serum TG from baseline to EOS.  
Baseline will be defined as the average of the (Screening Visits [S1 and S2 ] or [S2 and S3 ] 
occurring up to 28 days prior to Study Day 1 ) and Study Day 1 [pre-dose ]) values .  EOS will be 
defined as the average of Week 10 and Week 12.  If either the Week 10 or Week 12 value is 
missing, then the single value (Week 10 or Week 12) will be used.  Completely missing values 
(both Week 10 and Week 12) will be impute d using last observation carried forward (LOCF) , 
with the last on -treatment value carried forward as the EOS value.    
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 
percent change  from baseline to EOS  in TG as the dependent variable; treatment  and baseline 
statin (yes or no) as factor s; and baseline fasting serum TG as a covariate. The ANCOVA will be 
performed using the FAS , with subjects  included in their randomized treatment group regardless 
of the treatment the y actually received .  The least -squares mean (LSM) and standard error (SE) 
will be provided for each treatment group, along with the placebo -corrected LSM, its 95% 
confidence interval (CI), and associated p -value for both gemcabene groups .  A 2 -sided test with 
a significance level of 0.05 will be used for the comparison of the gemcabene 300 mg and 600 
mg groups separately to the placebo group.  If non- normality is detected, then either the data will 
be transformed so that it is normally distributed or a non parametric test will be used.   
A confirmatory analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed using the PPS.  
 Secondary Effica cy 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
• Change and percent change from baseline to Weeks 2, 6, 10 and 12 in fasting serum TG , and 
Page 236 of 307

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 8 change from baseline to EOS in fasting serum TG;  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Weeks 2, 6, 10, 12 and EOS  in total cholesterol 
(TC), non- HDL -C, HDL -C, and VLDL- C;  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Weeks 10, 12 and EOS  in Apo B, ApoA -I, 
ApoA- II, ApoA- V, ApoC -II, ApoC-III, and ApoE;  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Weeks 10, 12 and EOS in LDL- C 
(ultracentrif ugation), LDL- TG, VLDL -TG, HDL -TG;  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Week 12 in lipoprotein siz e and particle number 
(NMR);   
• Change and percent change from baseline to Week 12 in hsCRP, IL-6, SAA, ANGPTL4 , 
adiponectin and fibrinogen; and   
• Percent of subjects achieving a TG value < 500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) at E OS.   
For continuous secondary efficacy endpoints, the same ANCOVA model outlined above for the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be used, with the respective baseline included as the covariate.  
Baseline for TC, non -HDL -C, HDL -C, and VLDL -C will be defined as  the average of the last 
two pre -dose values  (generally will be the average of Visit S2 and pre -dose Study Day 1/Visit 
T1).  Baseline for fasting apolipoproteins, LDL -C (ultracentrifugation), LDL- TG, VLDL -TG, 
HDL -TG, hsCRP, IL -6, SAA, adiponectin, fibrinogen, and ANGPTL4 is defined as the value  
from pre -dose Study Day 1/Visit T1.  For the EOS time  point, EOS will be defined as the 
average of Week 10 and Week 12.  If either the Week 10 or Week 12 value is missing, then the 
single value (Week 10 or Week 12) will be used.  Completely missing values  (both Week 10 and 
Week 12) will be imputed using LOCF, with the last on -treatment value carried forward as the 
EOS value.  For all other time  points, missing values will be imputed using LOCF, with the last 
on-treatment value carried forward to that time  point. 
Each ANCOVA will be performed using the FAS, with subjects  included in their randomized 
treatment group regardless of the treatment they actually  received.  The output from each 
ANCOVA will include the LSM and SE for each treatment group, along with  the placebo -
corrected LSM, its 95% confidence interval (CI) and associated p -value for both gemcabene 
groups.  For every continuous endpoint (each parameter, each time  point), if non- normality is 
detected, then either the data will be transformed so that it is normally distributed or a 
nonparametric test will be used.   
The percent of subjects  achieving a TG value <  500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) will be analyzed 
using a logistic regression with treatment, baseline statin use (yes or no) and baseline TG value 
as independent factors.  The percent of subjects  in each treatment group achieving a TG value <  
500 mg/dL, and the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and p -values will be presented to 
compare gemcabene 300 mg and gemcabene 600 mg separately with the pl acebo group.   
The secondary efficacy analyses will be repeated using the PPS.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 10 AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  The summarization of AEs will include only treatment -emergent AEs 
(TEAEs), defined as AEs that begin or worsen after randomization and ingestion of the first dose 
of study drug. TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC), severity, and 
relationship to study drug for each treatment group. Deaths, withdrawal from study treatment 
due to AEs, and withdrawal from the study due to AEs will each be summarized by treatment 
group.   
Safety laboratory data will be summarized by treatment group at baseline, and at each post -
baseline time point, if applicable, and change from baseline to End of Treatment (Week 12) or

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 18 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 Background 
Gemcabene calcium is the monocalcium salt of a dialkyl ether dicarboxylic acid having 2 
terminal gem dimethyl carboxylate moieties. Gemcabene has a dual mechanism of action that 
involves: (1) enhancing the clearance of very-low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ); and (2) blocking 
the overall production of hepatic triglyceride (TG)  and cholesterol synthesis.  
Gemcabene enhances the clearance of VLDL by decreasing the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) of the APOC3 gene, thereby decreasing the production of the apolipoprotein C -III 
(apoC-III) protein.
1 This in turn unmasks ApoE which (1) enhances the clearance of the VLDL 
remnants via ApoE remnant receptor s; (2) reduces the formation of low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) particles ; and (3)  enhances  lipoprotein lipase mediated TG lipolysis allowing increased  
deliver y of fatty acids to muscle and adipose tissue.  
Gemcabene may also block the overall production of hepatic TG and cholesterol. Given its 
structural similarities to long -chain fatty acid, gemcabene may act as an inhibitor of acetyl CoA -
carboxylase ( ACC ), subsequently leading to a decrease  in hepatic TG production.2 Gemcabene 
may also inhibit one or more enzymes in the cholesterol synthesis pathway leading to less 
cholesterol in the cell, thereby upregulating LDL receptors  in the liver.  
In inflammatory states, cytokines, such as interleukin -6 (IL -6) and interleukin 1-beta (IL1-b), 
activate nuclear hormone receptors ( NHRs ), such as C/EPB -b, C/EPB -d and nuclear factor kappa 
B (NF -kB), and lead them to bind to the C-reactive protein ( CRP ) promoter and increase CRP 
mRNA production. Based on preclinical studies, gemcabene may inhibit the interaction of these NHR s on the CRP promoter and therefore reduce CRP mRNA production.
3  
Taken together, gemcabene’s mechanism of action should lower the full range of atherogenic particles (VLDL, IDL, and LDL) resulting in decreases in atherogenic particle number (apoB), partic le cholesterol (non -HDL -C) and TG (when elevated); with concomitant lowering of 
hsCRP.   
Gemcabene calcium rapidly converts to gemcabene free acid when in contact with the gastric 
fluid.  Gemcabene is rapidly absorbed following oral administration . It distr ibutes to the liver 
where it has its effect as the active molecule, with exposure increasing approximately linearly 
with dose. Steady state concentrations are achieved within six days of repeated dose 
administration , with an a verage half -life from 32 to 41 hours. Gemcabene's primary route of 
metabolism and elimination is  renal , predominantly as a gemcabene glucuronide formed in the 
kidney. 
1.2 Dose Selection  
We conducted (1) a prospective analysis in a gemcabene monotherapy study (1027- 04) in 
subjects  with mild- moderate hypertriglyceridemia ( baseline TG ≥ 200 mg/dL) ; (2) a 
retrospective integrated analysis  of Phase 2 dyslipidemic studies that included  subjects with 
baseline TG ≥ 200 mg/dL administered gemcabene monotherapy (1027- 04, 1027- 14 [healthy, 
obese subjects ], and 4141001 [monotherapy arm of a study in hyperlipidemia subjects  +/-

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 19 atorvastatin] ); and (3) a retrospective integrated analysis of Phase 2 dyslipidemic studies that 
included subjects with baseline TGs ≥ 200 mg/dL administered gemcabene in combination with 
statin therapy  (1027-18 and 4141001 [atorvastatin combination arms ]) to determine  the doses of 
gemcabene with the greatest TG lowering and the most favorable effects on LDL -C to test 
further in Phase 2 to support Phase 3.  Gemcabene 300 mg and the 600 mg were selected for 
following reasons: 
• The 300 mg once daily ( QD) dose is optimal based on the highest level of TG reduction in 
the gemcabene monotherapy  analyses  and dose response curve data from studies that assess 
gemcabene over across the full dose range;   
• Gemcabene has a U -shaped TG dose response curve in hypertriglyceridemia  subjects and 
including 600 mg along with 300 mg may further elucidate the mechanism; 
• Gemcabene 600 mg is the proposed dose for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and as 
such its effects in severe hypertriglyceridemia are being evaluated ; 
• Although TG lowering is mitigated at gemcabene 600 mg in hypertriglyceridemia subjects, 
LDL- C is significantl y lowered at the 600 mg dose by a median % change of 17% (p = 
0.026), unlike an increase of 8% (p = 0.076) at the 300 mg dose;   
• Decreases in ApoB were observed across all doses.   
Study 1027-04 
In a pre -specified analysis in subjects with baseline TG ≥ 200 mg/dL (Study 1027 -04) 
gemcabene lowered TG by a median % change at 12 weeks of 27% (p value for treatment 
difference < 0.05), 39% (p value for treatment difference < 0.01), 13% (p value for treatment difference = 0.623), and 9% (p value for treatment difference = 0.952) at the 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg doses, respectively, compared to a 5% lowering for placebo. The dose response curve was U -shaped with the maximum effect at 300 mg. There was a correlative 
decrease in ApoC -III of 24% (p < 0.05) and 31% (p < 0.01) at the 150 mg and 300 mg doses, 
respectively.  There was also a statistically significant lowering of ApoE by 37% (p < 0.01) at 300 mg.   
Similar to OMG -3 compounds and fibrates, gemcabene  increases LDL -C in subjects with 
isolated hypertriglyceridemia when TG levels are lowered. LDL -C elevation may be observed 
when triglyceride- rich VLDL lipolysis is facilitated as LDL are the metabolic product of VLDL 
catabolism .
4 In study 1027-04, non- significant increases in LDL -C of 16%  and 8% at 150 mg 
and 300 mg and significant lowering in LDL-C of 17% (p value for treatment difference = 0.026) 
and 23% (p value for treatment difference < 0.001) at gemcabene 600 mg and 900 mg, respectively; compared to an increase of 0.4% on placebo were observed.  It is hypothesized that 
in this population gemcabene is facilitating the formation of larger less atherogenic LDL particles, supported by a lowering of ApoB across all doses. 
Retrospective Integrated Analysis of Gemcabene Monotherapy  
A retrospective integrated analysis of  the effect of gemcabene monotherapy on TG in subjects  
with baseline TG ≥  200 mg/dL included studies 1027- 04 (low HDL), 1027- 14 (healthy obese) 
and 4141001 (hypercholesterolemic).

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 20 Gemcabene monotherapy subjects with baseline TG ≥ 200 mg/dL  had a difference  median % 
lowering in TG  of 25% ( p value for treatment difference = 0.0192) and 32% (p value for 
treatment difference = 0.0051) for gemcabene 150 mg (n = 22) and 300 mg (n = 27) , 
respectively, compared to a lowering of 3% for placebo (n  = 31).   No significant differences 
were observed in TG levels at the 600  mg or 900 mg doses versus placebo.   
A further sub -cut of subjects with baseline TG ≥ 400 mg/dL  yielded enough subjects to perform 
an analysis in subjects similar to those at risk for pancreatitis and representative of subjects to be 
enrolled in GEM -401. In this integrated analysis, subjects with TG ≥ 400 mg/dL on gemcabene 
300 mg (n = 8) lowered TG  by in median % change of 55% ( p value for treatment difference = 
0.0228), compared to a lowering of 20% for placebo (n = 6).  Clinically significant, statistically 
non-significant TG lowering was observed for the gemacbene 150 mg and 600 mg.  C linically 
non-significant, statistically non -significant TG lowering was observed for gemcabene 900 mg .  
Retrospective Integrated Analysis of Gemcabene Combined with Statin Therapy  
The effect of gemcabene as add-on or combination to statin therapy was also analyzed ( 1027-18; 
4141001 [atorvastain combination arms] ) in subjects with baseline TG ≥ 200 mg/dL. Gemcabene 
had a median % lowering in TG similar to monotherapy: 38% (p value for treatment difference = 
0.0067) for gemcabene  300 mg + statin (n = 23), compared to a  lowering of 19% with statin 
alone (n  = 26).  There were no subjects  in the dataset with baseline TG ≥ 400 mg/dL.  
Dose Response Curve over Full Dose Range  
In ONLY those studies that assessed gemcabene over its  full dose range  (1027- 04 and 
A4141001), consistent TG dose effects were observed across all sub -cuts of baseline TG, with 
peak lowering at the gemcabene 300 mg dose.   
 
In hypertrigyceridemic subjects , monotherapy gemcabene produces a U-shaped TG- lowering 
curve over its dose range.  In subjects with baseline TGs ≥ 500 mg/ dL gemcabene 300 mg lowers 
TG 50 -60%.  The effect on TG is  less at doses lower and higher than 300 mg, approximately 
30% with gemcabene 600 mg and 5% with gemcabene 900 mg.  Importantly, beneficial effect on

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 21 TG are still observ ed at the 600 mg dose in all hypertriglyceridemic populations. This waning in 
TG effect at the higher doses may be explained by the shift in the balance between the ApoE and 
ApoC proteins.  TG–rich particles are cleared through remnant receptors which is m ediated by a 
balance between the levels of ApoE and the ApoC proteins on the particle.  ApoE facilitates  
clearance, while the apo C’s inhibit clearance.  High level of ApoC- I, Apo C -II or ApoC- III 
appear to mask apo E, preventing it from recognizing /interacting with the remnant receptor, while allowing the particle to undergo lipolysis in the circulation. However, too much ApoC- III 
prevents intravascular lipolysis by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase ( LPL) and too little ApoC- II 
prevents adequate activation of  LPL.  Therefore , an optimal balance of ApoC- II to ApoC- III, and 
between ApoE and the ApoC proteins are needed to be achieve optimal lipolysis of the TG- rich 
particle and clearance of its remnant .
5-8   Preclinical data shows gemcabene lowers both ApoC- II 
and apo C- III, supporting enhanced ApoC-II reduction in humans at the higher gemcabene dose 
(600 and 900 mg), which result s in a reduction of optimal TG clearance via inhibition of LPL 
activation .1   The gemcabene 600 mg dose in the current study will enhance the understanding of 
the effects of gemcabene on ApoC-II and ApoC- III and ultimately TGs.  
1.3 Population Overview and Rationale  
Hypertriglyceridemia is a common condition present in about a third of the population. It is well 
established that severe HTG, defined as TG levels ≥  500 mg/dL (≥ 5.65 mmol/L) can 
significantly increases the risk of acute pancreatitis , and controlling TG levels  to well below 500 
mg/dL can effectively prevent the risk of its re currence. 9, 10, 11   
In subjects  with severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates, omega- 3 fatty acids ( OMG-
3) and occasionally niacin are first -line therapy.  
Niacin lowers TG and increases HDL -C levels in subjects  with TG > 500 mg/dL .  At doses of 
500 to 2000 mg/d ay, niacin lowers TG by 10 –30%, increases HDL -C by 10 –40%, and lowers 
LDL- C by 5 –20%.12,13 Increased risk of flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, cough, and pruritus 
with niacin has tended to limit its use in general practice. Moreover, when co -administered with 
lovas tatin or simvastatin, the risk of rhabdomyolysis and abnormal liver function is increased, 
particularly in the elderly and in subjects  with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or uncontrolled 
hypothyroidism.14  
Fibrates decrease TG levels by 30 –50% and somet imes increase HDL -C levels in subjects  with 
TG > 500 mg/dL .15 In subjects  with high TG levels, LDL -C levels may increase during therapy, 
likely due to an increased conversion of VLDL to LDL. Side effects associated with fibrates may include elevated liver enzymes, increased creatinine kinase ( CK). Fibrates are contraindicated i n 
subjects  with liver and gall bladder disease and should be used with caution in renal 
insufficiency. Gemfibrozil (unlike fenofibrate) inhibits multiple glucuronosyltransferases, which can lead to reduced statin excretion and increased risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.
15  
Omega-3 compounds are used in the treatment of subjects  with TG > 500 mg/dL .  To achieve a 
TG reduction of 20–50%, administration of 3–4 g/d of EPA plus DHA given in multiple capsules  
is required.12 As with fibrates, with the reductio ns of TG levels there can be increased levels of 
LDL- C. Most common side effects include fishy taste and burping with no increased in adverse 
effects reported for statin and OMG -3 co-administration.16

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 22 Background statin therapy is increasingly common in subjects  with moderate to severe 
hypertriglyceridemia due to increased cardiovascular risk in subjects  with moderate 
hypertriglyceridemia  and has become  standard of care in diabetic subjects across all severities of 
hypertriglyceridemia .  Therefore, a robust safety profile for TG -lowering compounds in 
combination with statins for these subjects  is a necessity .12   However, current lipid lowering 
agents are not ideal due to their limited TG -lowering effects and the potential for safety and 
tolerance issues, specifically in combination with statins.  
Gemcabene has shown TG lowering from 20 to >  50% based on dose and severity of 
hypertriglyceridemia. To date, gemcabene has been shown to be generally well tolerated in 
combination with statins , with no drug intera ction identified with either high -intensity 
simvastatin or atorvastatin.   The current study assesses the efficacy and safety of gemcabene 300  
mg and 600 mg in subjects with moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL  to < 
1500 mg/dL ) who may or  may not be receiving background statin therapy ( ± ezetimibe 10 mg) 
and who may or may not have Type 2 diabetes, a population representative of those 
hypertriglyceridemic subjects  at risk for pancreatitis.    
1.4 Risk/Benefit  
The clinical program conducted to date has demonstrated that gemcabene is generally well 
tolerated.  A total of 895 healthy adult subjects and subjects  with various underlying conditions 
(including dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and hypertension) have been exposed to a minimum of at least 1 dose of gemcabene at doses ranging from 150 mg to 1500 mg QD. This includes 
837 subjects  who received multiple doses of up to 900 mg for up to 12 weeks.  This also includes 
292 subjects  (150 subjects  on high- intensity) on gemcabene in combination with a statin.   Safety 
of these subjects  was evaluated by adverse event monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and vital sign assessments.  
No significant drug -drug interactions have been observed with simvast atin (80 mg), atorvastatin 
(80 mg), or digoxin (0.25 mg).  No clinically relevant effect on QTc or blood pressure has been  
observed.  
Across all clinical studies, the majority of  treatment- emergent adverse events  were mild to 
moderate in intensity. The most common adverse events reported include d headache, asthenia 
(feeling of weakness), nausea, dizziness, dyspepsia (upset stomach), infection , abnormal bowel 
movements, myalgia, and abnormal kidney function tests. Ten subjects  (1%) reported a 
treatment -emergent serious adverse  event ( SAE ) across all previous studies . None of these SAEs 
were considered treatment -related.  There were no deaths.  
Small mean increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been observed in 
some studies. These changes appeared within the first 2 to 4 weeks and did not appear to increase 
further over time. An iohexol clearance study showed that glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 
slightly decreased and was associated with a slight increase in serum creatinine. There was no 
indication of proteinuria or hematuria identified in any subject. There were no significant 
changes observed in urine protein, which seems to indicate that gemcabene does not cause tubular or glomerular injury. And, the increase was reversible with all creatinine values returning

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 23 to baseline within approximately 2 weeks of cessation of gemcabene, suggesting a vascular 
effect and not renal injury.  
Based on data in 94 hypertriglyceridemic subjects  (TG ≥ 200 mg/dL ) in the 1027-04 protocol, 
the 300 mg dose of gemcabene showed the greatest TG effect (median percent change of -38.9% 
[p<0.001]). The current study (GEM -401) will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
gemcabene 300 mg and 600 mg in subjects  with SHTG ( TG ≥ 500 to < 1500 mg/dL ) either on 
background statin therapy or statin naive with or without ezetimibe.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 26 3 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Summary of Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, multi -center study. Subjects  may 
enter the study with or without stable statin therapy , with or without ezetimibe (10 mg QD), and 
with or without diabetes, for  at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.  Approximately 90 
subjects  with severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL  to < 1500 mg/dL ) will be enrolled 
into the study. Total study duration will be up to 26 weeks with 12 weeks of study drug 
treatment.  The study will consist of a Pre -Screening Visit (only for subjects requiring a Wash-
Out Period), up to 3 Screening Visit s (to stabilize diet and lifestyle and determine TG levels) , a 
12-week Treatment Period  (with 5 Visits) , and a Follow-up Visit (4 we eks after the last dose) .  
Pre-Screening (Wash -Out Period):  A Wash-Out P eriod will be required for potential subjects 
taking any lipid -regulating therapies or supplements, with the exception of statins or ezetimibe 
10 mg QD. Subjects may initiate the Wash-Out P eriod, if meeting all other criteria and have a 
qualifying fasting TG value of ≥ 350 mg/dL. For subjects requiring a Wash-Out P eriod, the Pre -
Screening Visit will be their first study visit and will occur anywhere from 4 to 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (S1, Week -4to -2) based on the type of lipid- regulating therapy and its 
associated duration of wash-out required.  
Subjects currently taking lipid -altering medications such as: niacin >  200 mg/day, fibrates, 
prescription or over -the- counter fish oil or other products containing omega -3 fatty acids (OMG -
3), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, or 
other herbal products or dietary supplements with potential lipid- altering effects, must b e able to 
safely discontinue therapy at the Pre- Screening Visit. The duration of the Wash-Out P eriod will 
be dependent upon the status of the subject ’s current lipid -regulating therapy. Specifically, 
PCSK9 inhibitors will require an 8 -week Wash-Out P eriod, fibrates will require a 6 -week Wash-
Out P eriod, and niacin, OMG -3 compounds, bile acid sequestrants or other lipid- regulating 
therapies will require a 4 -week Wash-Out P eriod prior to the Screening Visit.  If the subject 
needs to be washed  off more than one lipid-altering medication; the medication that requires the 
longest W ash-Out P eriod will be the default.  For example, if a subject is taking OMG -3 and 
fibrates, then the subject would undergo a six -week Wash-Out Period. Exception: if a potential 
subject  is statin -naïve, or dosing only on a statin or ezetimibe (for at least 12 weeks) and not 
currently dosing on other lipid- altering medications, there is no requirement for a Pre -Screening 
Visit.  
During this Wash-Out P eriod, potential subjects will be counseled on the importance of 
maintaining a heart -healthy diet and limiting alcohol intake.  
Screening  Period : This is the TG qualifying period. All potential subjects will participate in the 
Screening Period, including Screening Visit 1 (S1), Screening Visit 2 (S2) and, if necessary as outlined below, optional Screening Visit 3 (S3) up to 28 days prior to Study Day 1 (Visit T1). For potential subjects on stable statin therapy  and/or ezetimibe  for ≥12 weeks and who do not 
require  a Wash-Out P eriod, S1 will be their first study visit.  For other subjects who have been 
washing out their other lipid medications, S1 occurs after the full required washout has been completed.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 27 During this Screening Period, potential subjects must meet the TG qualifying values in order to 
be eligible for randomization on Day 1 (Visit T1). 
The screening visits can be completed up to 28 days but not less than 14 days prior to T1 (Day 
1).  The visits are provided with recommended timepoints; however , the minimum time between 
visits can be as short as 1 week with the Screening Period as short as 14 days for qualification 
with S1 and S2 visits or 21 days for qualification with S2 and S3. At the end of this 2-4-week 
diet and lifestyle stabilization and TG qualifying period, eligible subjects must have an average 
fasting TG level ≥  500 mg/dL to < 1500 mg/dL  in order to qualify for the 12- week double -blind 
treatment period. The TG level for qualification will be based on the average (arithmetic mean) of the Visit S1 and Visit S2 values. If a subject 's average TG level from Visit S1 and Visit S2 
falls outside the required range for entry into the study, one additional sample for fasting TG 
value can be collected 1 week later (at the Optional Visit S3), and the arithmetic mean from 
Visits S2 and S3 will then be used to determine eligibility.   
Double -Blind Treat ment Period:  After confirmation of qualifying fasting TG values and all 
other inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible subjects will be randomized and enter a 12- week, 
double- blind treatment period. At Visit T1, 90 eligible subjects will be randomized via an 
interactive web/voice response system (IWRS/IVRS) on Study Day 1 in a 1:1:1 ratio (30 subjects per group) to one of the following treatment groups:  
• Gemcabene 300 mg QD, or  
• Gemcabene 600 mg QD, or 
• Placebo  
Subjects  will be stratified by statin therapy  (yes or no)  and qualifying TG value ( < 880 mg/dL or 
≥ 880 mg/dL) to ensure background therapies and baseline TG values are balanced across all 
treatment groups.   
The primary evaluation of efficacy will be at EOS  (using the average of Week 10 [T 4] and Week 
12 [T 5]).  The Follow -up Visit (telephone call) will occur 4 weeks (±  3 days) after the last dose 
of study drug. 
3.2 Study Indication(s) 
Treatment with gemcabene is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce serum triglyceride (TG) 
levels in adult patients  with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥  500 mg/dL); where lowering TG 
levels below 500 mg/dL may decrease a patient ’s risk for developing pancreatitis.

4.3 Withdrawal Criteria  
Participation of a subject in this clinical study may be discontinued for any of the following 
reasons:  
• The subject  withdraws  consent or requests discontinuation from the study for any reason; 
• Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance (ie, alert TG value ≥ 2000 mg/dL; 
8.1.4.4) that exposes the subject  to substantial risk and/or does not allow the subj ect to adhere 
to the requirements of the protocol; 
• Any SAE , clinically  significant adverse event, severe laboratory abnormality, concomitant  
illness, or other medical condition which indicates to the Investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the subject; 
• Pregnancy;  
• Requirement of a concomitant medication  which is prohibited by the protocol; 
• Subject  failure  to comply with protocol requirements or study- related procedures; or  
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor or any regulatory authority (ies). 
If a subject  withdraws prematurely from the study due to the above criteria or any other reason, 
study staff should make every effort to complete the full panel of assessments scheduled for the Early Termination (ET) Visit.  The reason for subject  withdrawal must be documented in the 
electronic Case Report F orm (eCRF).  When a subject withdraws due to a SAE, the SAE must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements as defined.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 32 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment Groups  
Ninety  subjects  will be randomized on Study Day 1  in a 1:1:1  ratio to the following treatment 
groups: placebo or gemcabene 300 mg  or gemcabene 600 mg . Subjects  may be on a stable sta tin 
regimen  as appropriate , with or without ezetimibe 10 mg  QD for at least 12 weeks prior to  the 
Screening Visit. Subjects  will be stratified  by baseline statin therapy (yes or no) and qualifying 
TG value (< 880 mg/dL or ≥ 880 mg/dL).  
5.2 Dose Rationale 
Based on a prospective analysis in a gemcabene monotherapy study (1027- 04) in subjects with 
mild-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 200 mg/dL) and a retrospective integrated analysis of 
all studies (1027- 04, 1027- 14 [healthy, obese subjects ], and 4141001 [hyperlipidemia subjects  
+/- atorvastatin] ) that tested gemcabene monotherapy in subjects with mild to severe 
hypertriglyceridemia , we conclude that the 300 mg QD dose is optimal based on monotherapy 
data.  The 600 mg dose will also be included in the GEM-401 protocol for the following reasons: 
gemcabene 600 mg is the proposed dose for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and as such 
its effects in severe hypertriglyceridemia need to be understood; gemcabene has a U -shaped TG 
dose response curve in Type IV subjects and further study with gemcabene 600 mg may further 
elucidate the me chanism; although TG lowering is mitigated at gemcabene 600 mg in 
hypertriglyceridemia s ubjects , LDL-C is significantly lowered at the 600 mg dose by a median %  
change of 17% (p = 0.026), unlike an increase of 8% (p = 0.076) at the 300 mg dose.  Non-
signif icant decreases in ApoB were observed at all doses. Therefore, we propose including the 
300 mg and 600 mg dose in our Phase 2 study to assess efficacy , safety and tolerability in severe 
hypertriglyceridemia  (TG ≥ 500 mg/ dL to < 1500 mg/dL ) prior to Phase 3.  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
Subjects  who have completed the Screening  Visit and meet all of the inclusion and none of 
exclusion criteria  will be randomized  into the study  on Study Day 1 . Randomized treatment 
assignmen t and randomization numbers will be  assigned via IWRS/IVRS. Following 
randomization, study drug will be dispensed in a double -blind manner. The Sponsor and all 
clinical site personnel (Investigator, pharmacist, etc.) will be blinded to the treatment group for 
each subject. S ubjects  also w ill be blinded to the treatment they receive .  
5.4 Breaking the Blind  
Blinding is not to be broken during the study unless considered necessary by the Investigator for 
emergency situations for reasons of subject  safety. The Investigator should contact the Medical 
Monitor who will break the blind  in a qualifying event. When the blind is broken, the reason 
must be fully documented.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 34 5.5.3 Study Drug Preparation a nd Dispensing 
Study drug will be administered at the site on clinic visit days. Subjects will receive a study drug 
kit comprised of two bottles, labeled Bottle A and Bottle B. Subjects must take one tablet from 
each bottle every day. In no case should the subject take two tablets from the same bottle on a 
given day.  Subjects  will self -dose at all other times during the Treatment Period. The 
Investigator or designee will provide subjects  with sufficient study drug until the next scheduled 
study visit.  
5.5.4 Study Drug Administration  
The first dose of study drug will be administered at the site on Study Day 1. On days with a scheduled office visit with blood sample collection, subject  will remain fasted and should not 
take gemcabene until after the blood samples ar e collected at the site.  On all other days, the 
subject  will self -dose: taking study drug at the same time in the morning with a full glass (8 
ounces) of water either with or without food.  If a subject  misses a dose  prior to 6:00 PM , then 
the subject  should take their dose.  However, if past 6:00 PM, the subject should not dose and 
then count the dose as a “missed dose.”  The subject  will resume normal dosing the next day  
(i.e., do not take two doses the following day).  
5.5.5 Treatment Compliance  
Subjects  will be instructed to take study drug daily according to the protocol and return used and 
unused packaging to the site at each subsequent study visit.  
Compliance with administration of study drug will be assessed at each study visit 
post-randomization during the Treatment Period  and at the E arly Termination  Visit, if applicable , 
and recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the drug accountability log.  The Investigator or designee will remind subjects  at each visit of the importance of following the 
protocol- defin ed schedule for taking study drug. Reasons for not following the study drug 
administration  schedule as described in the protocol will be clearly recorded in the source 
documents. 
5.5.6 Storage and Accountability 
The study drug will be stored at controlled room t emperature ( 15 to 30°C ) in a secured location 
(locked) with access restricted to authorized personnel only. Storage temperature will be 
monitored and recorded.  
Upon receipt of study drug, the Investigator or designee will conduct a complete inventory of all 
study drug and ensure no damage occurred during shipment.  
The Investigator will maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of study drug. Drug accountability logs will identify the study drug code number and account for the disposition on a subject -by-subject basis, includi ng specific dates and quantities. 
The drug accountability logs will be signed by the individual who dispenses the study drug and copies will be provided to the Sponsor.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 35 All used and unused supplies will be appropriately inventoried and verified by the clinical 
research associate (CRA).  
Unused study drug may be destroyed at  the sites according to their Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs). If a site does not have appropriate SOPs for compliance, the study drug will 
be returned to the Sponsor at the end of t he study . 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures  
5.6.1 Permitted Medications and/or Procedures 
Subjects  are required to be on a stable, heart -healthy  diet.  Randomized subjects  should remain  
on previously prescribed background stable statins or ezet imibe 10 mg QD for the duration of the 
study , if started at least 12 weeks prior to the Screening  visit.  Subjects  with Type 2 diabetes who 
receive pharmacologic treatment  must be on a stable regime n for 3 months prior to signing 
informed consent  at the Screening Visit (S2).   It is strongly recommended that subjects  with 
Type 2 diabetes be under routine care for management and monitoring of their diabetes. 
5.6.2 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures 
Subjects  are not permitted to receive treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor (8 weeks prior to the 
Screening Visit), a fibrate lipid -regulating agent (6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit), niacin (4 
weeks prior to the Screening Visit), or other lipid- regulating therapies such as bile acid 
sequestrants and OMG -3 compounds (4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit).  If subjects have a 
confirmed TG alert value of > 2000 mg/dL they should follow the steps in Section 8.1.4.4 which 
may require the subject to  stop study treatment and begin TG -lowering rescue medication 
including OMG -3 compounds and/or fibrates. Subjects  are not permitted the use of tamoxifen, 
estrogens or progestins that ha ve not been stable for >  4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (S1) , 
nor the use of oral or injected corticosteroids or anabolic steroids. 
Subjects  are instructed to follow the package label for all concomitant medications, including 
statins . See Append ix D for a reference list of CYP 3A4 inhibitors.  
5.6.3 Restrictions and Dietary Guidelines  
It is important that subjects  are instructed to not undertake any form of strenuous physical 
activity for at least 24 hours prior to blood testing.  Subjects  are restricted from using alcohol within 48 hours prior to study visits. Subjects  must not 
drink more than 2 units of alcohol per day.  A unit of alcohol is defined as a 12 ounce s (350 ml) 
of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine, or 1.5 ounces (45) ml of 80-proof alcohol for mixed drinks; 
All clinic visit assessments require subjects to fast .  This is  defined as no food or caloric 
beve rages for at least 10 hours prior to sample collection. Subjects  will be permitted to have 
water , black tea or black coffee.   
On all other days, the subject  will self -dose: taking study drug at the same time in the morning 
with a full glass (8 ounces) of water either with or without food.

Clinical Study Protocol GEM -401 
Confidential & Proprietary  
 
Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 36 Subjects  will maintain  a stable, heart -healthy  diet (counsel led per NCEP ATP -III guidelines or 
equivalent) throughout the study. 
5.6.4 Documentation of Prior/Concomitant Medication Use and Procedures 
A concomitant medication is any treatment including nutritional supplements, vitamins, or 
over-the- counter medications received by  or prescribed to the subject concomitantly to the study, 
from the time of informed consent to the Follow -up Visit or  the ET Visit, if applicable.  
Concomitant Procedures are procedures (i.e. tooth extraction, CT scan), and NOT the clinically 
relevant diagnosis that p recipitated the  procedure. 
The Investigator should record the use of all concomitant medications taken during the study, 
both prescribed and over the counter, in the eCRF and the source document. This includes drugs used on a chronic and as needed basis. Subjects  should be discouraged from starting any new 
medication, both prescribed and over the counter, without consulting the Investigator, unless the new medication is required for an emergency.  Concomitant procedures will be documented on 
the Concomitant Medicat ion CRF and the reason for the procedure (i.e. diagnosis) will be 
documented on the Medical History or Adverse Event CRF, whichever is appropriate.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 37 6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
A tabular listing of the Schedule of Procedures can be found in Appendix A . ALL CLINIC 
VISITS REQUIRE THAT THE SUBJECT  IS IN A FASTED STATE . This is defined as no food 
or caloric beverage for at least 10  hours prior to sample collection. Subjects  will be permitted to 
have water , black tea or black coffee.  
6.1 Informed Consent  
Written  informed consent for the study will be obtained from all subjects  before any 
protocol- specific procedures are performed. See Section 11.3 for details on informed consent.  
6.2 Pre-Screening Visit  
Only subjects  requiring a Wash-O ut Period will participate in the Pre -Screening Visit.  
Subjects must have a Pre-Screening TG value ≥ 350 mg/dL and < 1 800 mg/dL before 
washing out of current  TG-lowering therapies and proceeding to S 1.   
A Wash-Out P eriod will be required for eligible subjects  taking any lipid -regulating therapies  or 
supplements, with the exception of  statins or ezetimibe . For subjects  requiring a Wash-Out 
Period, the Pre -Screening Visit will be their first study visit and will occur prior to the Screening 
Visit based on the duration of the Wash-Out P eriod required. Specifically, PCSK9 inhibitors will 
require an 8 -week Wash-Out P eriod, fibrates will require a 6 -week Wash-Out P eriod, and niacin, 
OMG-3, bile acid sequestrants or other lipid-regulating therapies  will r equire a 4 -week Wash-
Out P eriod  prior to the Screening Visit. If the subject needs to be washed off more than one 
lipid-altering medication; the medication that requires the longest Wash-Out P eriod will be the 
default.  For example, if a subject is taking OMG- 3 and fibrates, then the subject would undergo 
a six-week Wash-Out Period. 
The Wash-Out P eriod will only be initiated after inclusionary lab values are received and 
reviewed.   
The following procedures will be performed at the Pre- Screening Visit: 
• Obta in informed consent; 
• Conduct eligibility assessment based on inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
• Obtain medical/surgical history and demographics; 
• Obtain concomitant medications; including all anti-diabetes  pharmacologic therapy  for 
subjects  with Type 2 diabetes  
• Perform full physical examination;  
• Record vital signs, height, weight and calculate BMI ; 
• Collect urine sample; 
• Perform urine pregnancy test (for women of child -bearing potential only); 
• Obtain blood sample for the following:

o TSH, HbA1c, and s erology  (HBV, HCV, and HIV) ; and  
o Fasting serum TG only; 
• Explain importance of continued adherence to a stable, heart -healthy diet and limited alcohol 
intake;  
• Initiate wash -out; and  
• Assess adverse events (AEs  that occur prior to the first dose of study drug [ Study Day 1 ] 
should be reported as an update to medical history as well as be reported on the  appropriate 
adverse event eCRF) and concomitant medications.  
6.3 Screening Visit s 
The screening visits can be completed up t o 28 days but not less than 14 days prior to T1 
(Day 1).  The visits are provided with recommended timepoints; however the minimum 
time between visits can be as short as 1 week with the screening period as short as 14 days 
for qualification w ith S1 and S2 visits or 21 days for qualification with S2 and S3.  
To qualify for randomization into the treatment period, the mean of TG value at Visits S1 
and S2 must be ≥ 500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) to  < 1500 mg/dL (16.95 mmol/L) with the 
greater value not more than 50% of the lower value. If the mean of TG values at Visit s S1 
and S2 is <  500 mg/dL or ≥ 1500 mg/dL  or outside the 50% range in variability, the subject  
can be brought in for an additional TG value (lipid profile) one week later at Week -1 
(Screening Visit S3).  If the mean of TG values at Visits S2 and S3 is < 500 mg/dL or ≥ 1500 
mg/dL  or outside the 50% range in variability, then the subject  will be a screen failu re.  
Subjects  who are a screen failure may not re- screen at any time.  
If all of the inclusion criteria ( Section 4.1) are met and the subject  has none of the exclusion 
criteria ( Section 4.2) the subject  may be randomized into the 12- week treatment period.  
6.3.1 Screening Visit  1 (up to Day -28 to -14/Week -4 or -2 ) 
Only  those  subjects  NOT requiring wash -out from PCSK9 inhibitors , fibrate s, niacin, 
OMG -3 or bile-acid sequestrants  may participate in Screening Visit  1.  Subjects  may be 
receiving statins (± ezetimibe 10 mg ) only if therapy is  stable for ≥ 12 weeks prior to 
Screening Visit 1.  
Subjects must have S1 TG value ≥ 425 mg/dL and < 1800 mg/dL before proceeding to S2.   
For subjects who required a Wash-Out P eriod and completed the Pre- Screening Visit, the 
following Screening Visit procedures will not be repeated: informed consent, full physical 
examination, height, TSH, HbA1c, and serology  (HBV, HCV, and HIV) . Updates, as needed, 
will be made to medical/surgical history, demographics, and concomitant medications.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 47 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
subject  administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
Adverse events, which include abnormal an d clinically significant clinical laboratory test 
variables, will be monitored and documented from the time of first dose of study drug ( Study 
Day 1 ) until study participation is complete  (the Follow -up Visit) . Subjects should be instructed 
to report any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator. Beginning with the signing 
of the informed consent  until the time of the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ), Investigators 
should make updates to medical history and record a ny pre -existing medical condition or signs or 
symptoms that changes in severity, frequency, or seriousness in the medical history . Serious 
adverse event s that occur prior to the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ) should be reported as 
an update to medical history as well as be reported on the appropriate adverse event e CRF.  
Beginning with the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ), Investigators should make an 
assessment for adverse events at each visit and record all adverse event s, non-s erious and 
serious, on t he appropriate adverse event  eCRF . 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the Investigator , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF.  
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure. Concomitant procedures should be recorded as such on the appropriate eCRF.  
Any medical condition al ready present prior to the subject  taking the f irst dose of study drug 
(Study Day 1 ) should be reported in the medical history. Any SAEs  occurring prior to the first 
dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ) should be reported as an update to medical history as well as 
an adverse event. Any pre -existing medical condition or signs or symptoms that changes in 
severity , frequency, or seriousness after the subject takes the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 
1) and through the Follow-up Visit should be reported as an adverse event. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory  values or other examinations ( e.g., ECG ) that are 
detected at the time of the first dose of study drug ( Study Day 1 ) and worsen during the study 
should be reported as adverse event s. An abnormal laboratory result that is not verified by re peat 
testing does not necessitate reporting as an adverse event. The Investigator will exercise his or 
her medical,  scientific , and clinical  judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding 
or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal,

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 48 stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an 
error does not re quire reporting as an adverse event . 
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than specified in the protocol and higher than known therapeutic doses. Overdoses with associated symptoms are always handled as AEs and reported as such. Overdoses without associated 
symptoms are not reported as AEs but are documented in [specify eg, CRF] in order to collate information for the IB regarding the level of excess dosage taken or administered without adverse effects. A n overdose will be reported irrespective of outcome even if toxic effects were 
not observed. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
For adverse events with a causal relationship to study drug, follow -up by the Investigator will be 
required until the event or its sequelae  resolve or stabilize to a level acceptable to the 
Investigator. 8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (s ee Investigator’s Brochure) . 
For gemcabene,  the reference safet y information is included in  Section s 8.4 and 10 of the 
Investigator’s Brochure currently in force. The reference safety information will be reviewed 
yearly and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized with the reporting period of the Development Safety Update Report . 
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator 
The Investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will  also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug 
using the categories of Y es or No, as defined below . 
Assessment of Severity:  
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality Assessment:  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs. The causality is the 
determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug itself (eg, gemcabene or placebo) caused or contributed to an AE.  
If the final determination of causality is  unknown and the Investigator does not know whether 
the study drug caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to study drug” for 
reporting purposes. If the Investigator’s causality is “unknown, but not related to study drug”, 
this should be clearly documented on study records.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 49 The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug will be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
No (unlikely related, unrelated, not related, no relation)  – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a 
causal relationship and another cause (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, therapies, and 
complications ) is suspected.  
Yes (possibly related, related ) – The time course between the administration of study drug and 
the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause ( e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, therapies, and complications ) can be 
identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
The following factors should also be consider ed: 
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event. 
• Underlying, concomitant diseases  (medical history) - 
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject  may have.  
• Concomitant drug - 
o The other drugs the subject  is taking or the treatment the subject  receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in 
question. 
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - 
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likel y to be 
a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses  - 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a 
logical and better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and PKs of the study drug - 
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 50 8.1.4 Specific Safety Measures  
8.1.4.1 Hemoglobin decrease 
For a hemoglobin decrease  of > 1.5 g/dL from baseline during the study,  repeat hematology 
studies and reflexive evaluation of reticulocyte count will be performed . The subject ’s past 
medical history , concomitant medications (including  over the counter drugs  and herbal 
supplements ), and any recent symptoms ( e.g., bleeding, shortness of breath, fatigue) will be 
reviewed to determine a potential etiology and make a clinical assessment of the significance of 
the finding. 
8.1.4.2 Creatinine increase  
If, at any visit, a creatinine increase of > 0.3 mg/dL (27 µmol/L) from baseline , a GFR decrease 
of >15 mL/min from baseline, or a > 30 urinary albumin:creatine ratio mg/g is observed , a repeat 
chemistry/urinalysis  will be performed. The subject ’s past medical history, concomitant 
medications (including over the counter drugs and herbal suppleme nts), and any recent 
symptoms ( e.g., fatigue, malaise, polyuria/oliguria, or palpitations) will be reviewed to determine 
a potential etiology and make a clinical assessment of the significance of the finding . 
During the study, clinically significan t abnormal results in NGAL will be used as a means of 
identifying subjects  who have unremarkable creatinine/BUN studies at the time of assessment 
but may require additional or closer/follow -up monitoring of renal parameters .  Cystatin -C will 
be measured at  baseline and Week 12.  
8.1.4.3 Possible muscle and liver injury 
For muscle injur y, CK, hepatic, and renal function laboratory data will be integrated with 
myopathy signs and symptoms. For management of CK elevations  > 3 × ULN, refer to 
Appendix E . For liver injur y, laboratory data will be integrated with hepatic signs and symptoms. 
Alanine aminotransferase increases > 2 × ULN with symptoms of hepatitis or >  3 × ULN with or 
without symptoms of hepatitis will be evaluated and managed according to guidelines.  
8.1.4.4 Increased risk for pancreatitis (TG ≥ 2000 mg/dL) 
To prevent the risk for pancreatitis, lab alerts will be given for TG values ≥ 2000 mg/dL. A 
subject with a TG ≥ 2000 mg/dL should have a confirmatory TG value obtained within 1 week.  
As a first step, the subject should be immediately counseled and managed on their adherence to a 
heart -healthy diet, restricted alcohol intake and diabetic control . A follow- on TG value should be 
obtained 2 weeks  later.  If the TG remains ≥ 2000 mg/dL then the study medication should be 
stopped, and the subject should complete the ET visit  and be instructed to begin TG -lowering 
rescue medication (fibrates and/or OMG -3 compounds). 
8.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse event;

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 53 All other suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the FDA, applicable 
competent authorities concerned , and to the Central Ethics Committee concerned  as soon as 
possible, but within a maximum of 15 days of first knowledge by the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor will also inform all Investigators as required.  
Expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions related to 
non-investigational medical products (NIMPs ) used in this study  (e.g., simvastatin, atorvastatin, 
rosuvastatin, and/or ezetimibe ) will not be necessary. Listings of the cases related to these 
NIMPs will be included in the Development Safety Update Report.  
8.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected at the visits  shown in the Schedule of 
Procedures (Appendix A ) and the data captured will be forwarded to the central laboratory for 
evaluation. Assessments that require a subject to fast will be defined as no food or  caloric 
beverage for at least 10  hours prior to sample collection. Subjects  will be permitted to have 
water, black tea or black coffee.  
Central laboratory results will be provided to the sites , with the exception of the post -
randomization lipid values . TG alert values with a risk mitigation plan is in place with the 
Central Labo ratory  (Section 8.1.4.4 Increased risk for pancreatitis [TG ≥ 2000 mg/dL ]).  
Laboratory results that appear potentially spurious based on the I nvestigator’s clinical 
assessment and review of the subject ’s medical history may be repeated for confirmation of  the 
finding. Reassessments of non- qualifying screening labs must be reviewed and approved by the 
Medical M onitor prior to obtaining the new specimen. The clinical rationale for performing 
repeat testing of screening assessments should be thoroughly documented. Standard clinical laboratory evaluations for safety chemistry , coagulation, and hematology will 
be conducted at all study visits and the Follow -up Visit  (only for subjects  who had an abnormal 
result at Week 12  [or the ET Visit, if applicable] or an ongoing treatment- related adverse event ). 
Clinically significant a bnormal creatinine  results  at Week 12  (or the ET Visit, if applicable)  will 
also be followed- up 2 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug in addition to the 4 week 
(±3 days) Follow-up Visit.  See Appendix B  for a list of clinical laboratory analytes. 
A full fasting lipid panel will be assessed at the Pre -Screening Visit, if applicable, and at all  other 
study visits, including the Follow -up Visit . Fasting apolipoproteins  and LDL -C 
(ultracentrif ugation) will be asse ssed at Study Day 1 , Week 10 , Week 12 , the Follow -Up Visit, 
and the ET Visit, if applicable . In addition to these lipid parameters, hsCRP , IL-6, SAA, and 
fibrinogen will also be measured at Study Day 1 , Week 10, Week 12 , and the ET Visit, if 
applicable.  Finally, ANGPLT4, adiponectin and cystatin -C will be measured at Study Day 1  and 
Week 12  (or the ET Visit, if applicable ).  
A urine sample for urinalysis will be collected at the  Pre-Screening Visit, if applicable , the 
Screening Visit , Study Day 1 , Week 6, Week 12, the Follow -up Visit ( only for subjects  who had 
an abnormal result at Week 12  [or the ET Visit, if applicable] or an ongoing treatment -related 
adverse event ), and the ET Visit, if applicable . Urine protei n:creatinine ratio and 
albumin:creatinine ratio will be performed at the Screening  Visit, Study Day 1 , Week 6, Week

Visit, if applicable] or an ongoing treatment -related adverse event ), and the ET Visit, if 
applicable. Urinary NGAL will be measured at Study Day 1 , Week 6, Week 12 , the Follow -up 
Visit (only for subjects  who had an abnormal result at Week 12  [or the ET Visit, if applicable] or 
an ongoing tr eatment -related adverse event) .  
Tests for HBV, HCV, and HIV will be conducted at the subject ’s first study visit, either at the 
Pre-Screening Visit , if applicable,  or the Screening Visit.  
For women of child- bearing potential only, a  serum  pregnancy test w ill be conducted at the 
Screening Visit , Week 12 , and the ET Visit, if applicable . A urine pregnancy test will be 
conducted at the Pre- Screening Visit, Study Day 1 , Week 2 , Week 6, and Week 10.  
Thyroid -stimulating hormone will be measured at the subject ’s first study visit, either at the 
Pre-Screening Visit, if applicable, or the Screening Visit.  
Fasting insulin levels and FPG  will be measured at Study Day 1  and Week 12.  
HbA1c  will be measured at the subject ’s first study visit, either at the Pre -Screenin g Visit, if 
applicable, or the Screening Visit, Study Day 1  and Week 12.  
The estimated blood volume for the full study is 625 mL. 
8.7 Vital Signs  
Measurement of vital signs will include an assessment of pulse rate, blood pressure, res piration 
rate, and temper ature. Vital signs will be measured at all s tudy visits, excluding the Follow -up 
Visit. Blood pressure should be obtained in the seated position, after the subject  has rested 
comfortably for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure  at the Screening Visit should be obtained in 
both arms and the arm with the highest  diastolic  value should be used for ongoing monitoring 
throughout the rest of the study. If an automated assessment is performed, the same machine 
should be used for the subject  throughout the st udy when possible . Care should be taken to 
ensure an appropriate cuff size is utilized.   8.8 Electrocardiograms  
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be performed in triplicate and sent to a central reviewer. 
Subjects  should be lying quietly in a fully supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to each 
12-lead ECG. A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit , Study Day 1 , Week 2 , 
Week 6, Week 10 , Week 12 , and the ET Visit, if applicable.  
The Investigator will assess ECG data as normal, abnormal not clinically significant, or 
abnormal clinically significant. Any clinically significant abnormalities should be documented as medical history/ adverse event/SAE as applicable. All ECG traces will be kept as source data.  
8.9 Physical Examinations 
A full physical examination will be performed  at the subject ’s first study visit, either at the 
Pre-Screening Visit, if applicable, or the Scree ning Visit,  Week 12 , and the ET Visit, if

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 55 applicable. A full physical examination  includes genitourinary examination per the Investigator’s 
discretion and does not include a rectal exam ination .  
A symptom -directed physical exam ination  will be conducted at the Screening Visit (only  for 
subjects  who required a Wash-Out P eriod and completed the  full physical examination at the  
Pre-Screening Visit ), Study Day 1 , Week 2 , Week 6, Week 10 and the Follow -up Visit  (only for 
subjects  who had an abnormal result at Week 12  [or the ET Visit, if applicable] or an ongoing 
treatment -related adverse event ). 
Height will be measured at the subject ’s first study visit, either at the Pre -Screening Visit, if 
applicable, or the Screening Visit and weight  will be measured at all study visits , excluding the 
Follow- up Visit . BMI will be calculated at the Pre-Screening Visit  or Screening Visit, Day  1, 
Week  10, and Week 12. Waist circumference will be measured at Day 1 and Week 12 [or the ET 
Visit, if applicable] .    
8.10 Medical/Surgical History  and Demographics 
Medical and surgical history and demographics will be recorded at the Pre -Screening Visit, if 
applicable, and/ or the Screening Visit . Subject  eligibility will be evaluated to determine all 
inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met. The Investigator will inquire with the 
subject  at Study Day 1  to determine if  there have been any changes in the subject ’s health 
affecting eligibility or requiring an update to their medical and surgical history.  
8.11 Reserve Samples  and Pharmacokinetics (PK)  
Additional blood samples will be collected at all study visits during the Treatment Period and the 
ET Visit, if applicable, to be available for  analysis of exploratory biomarkers associated with 
lipid metabolism ( which may include but will not limited to RLP -C, RLP -TG and RLP -apoB, 
Lp(a), ox -LDL, and Lp -PLA2) , repeat lipid testing, blood drug levels including use in 
confirming subject  compliance (PK analysis), and/or repeat or additional clinical laboratory 
testing in the event of a safety issue.  
Reserve samples will be stored for a minimum of 1 year following study completion and may be 
stored until the IND is with drawn or the NDA is approved.  If requested, results of tests 
performed on study samples will be made available to subjects or investigators. Subjects may not withdraw their samples.  
The plasma reserve samples collected at Week 2, Week 6, Week 10 and Week 12 [or the ET 
Visit, if applicable]  will be used for the analysis of PK. To facilitate the analysis of PK samples, 
the time and date of the last dose of study medication and statin if applicable (generic name and strength) prior to the clinic visit will be  collected by the subject via a diary.  In addition, the time 
and date of the PK blood sample at the clinic visit will be collected.  
 
8.12 Diary  
All subjects will complete a Sponsor -provided paper diary prior to all study visits that require PK 
samples. The su bject will document the exact date and time of their last dose of study drug and,

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 57 9 STATISTICS  
9.1 Sample Size  
Approximately 90 subjects (30 subjects  per treatment group) will be randomized into 1 of 3 
treatment groups: gemcabene 300 mg, gemcabene 600 mg or placebo. 
A sample size of 30 randomized subjects in the gemcabene 300 mg group, 30 randomized 
subjects in the 600 mg group and 30 randomized subjects in the placebo group is expected to 
provide 80% power to detect a difference of 35% in the percent change in TG from baseline to end of study (EOS) between either of the gemcabene treatment groups and the placebo group.  This calculation is based on a 2 -sided t -test at the 5% level of significance (α = 0.05), a common 
standard deviation of 43, and a drop-out rate of 15%.   
9.2 Analysis Populations 
9.2.1 Full Analysis Set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all randomized subjects  who receive at least 1 dose 
of study drug and have at least 1 post -baseline efficacy  assessment . The FAS population will be 
the primary analysis population. All efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS . 
9.2.2 Per Protocol Set  
The Per Protocol S et (PPS) will include all FAS subjects  who complete the 12- week Treatment 
Period  without major protocol deviations. The  PPS will be used to assess robustness of the 
analysis results. Protocol deviations will be reviewed and the PPS will be determined prior to 
database lock.  
9.2.3 Safety Analysis Set  
The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) will include all randomized subjects  who receive at least 1 dose 
of study drug. All safety analyses will be conducted on SAS .  
9.3 Statistical Methods  
9.3.1 Analysis of Efficacy  
9.3.1.1 Primary efficacy analyse s 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in fasting serum TG from baseline to EOS.  Baseline will be defined as the average of the (Screening Visits [S1 and S2] or [S2 and S3] occurring up to 28 days prior to Study Day 1) and Study Day 1 [pre -dose]) values.  EOS will be 
defined as the average of Week 10 and Week 12.  If either the Week 10 or Week 12 value is missing, then the single value (Week 10 or Week 12) will be used.  Completely missing values (both Week 10 and Week 12) will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF), with the last on -treatment value carried forward as the EOS value.

Gemphire Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol GEM -401 
Confidential & Proprietary  
 
Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 58 The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 
percent change from baseline to EOS in TG as the dependent variable; treatment  and baseline 
statin (yes or no) as factor s; and baseline fasting serum TG as a covariate. The ANCOVA will be 
performed using the FAS, with subjects included in their randomized treatment group regardless 
of the treatment they actually received.  The least -squares mean (LSM) and standard error (SE) 
will be provided for each treatment group, along with the placebo -corrected LSM, its 95% 
confidence interval (CI), and associated  p value for both gemcabene groups.  A 2- sided test with 
a significance level of 0.05 will be used for the comparison of the gemcabene 300 mg and 600 mg groups separately to the placebo group.  If non -normality is detected, then either the data will 
be transformed so that it is normally distributed or a nonparametric test will be used.    A confirmatory analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed using the PPS.  9.3.1.2 Secondary efficacy analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
• Change and percent change from baseline to Weeks 2, 6, 10 and 12 in fasting serum TG, and 
change from baseline to EOS in fasting serum TG;  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Weeks 2, 6, 10, 12 and EOS in total cholesterol (TC),  non- HDL -C, HDL -C, and VLDL- C;  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Weeks 10, 12 and EOS in Apo B, ApoA -I, 
ApoA- II, ApoA -V, ApoC -II, ApoC-III, and ApoE;  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Weeks 10, 12 and EOS in LDL -C 
(ultracentrifugation), LDL -TG, VLDL -TG, HDL -TG;  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Week 12 in lipoprotein size and particle number 
(NMR);  
• Change and percent change from baseline to Week 12 in hsCRP, IL -6, SAA, ANGPTL4, 
adiponectin and fibrinogen; and  
• Percent of subjects achieving a TG value <500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) at EOS.   
For continuous secondary efficacy endpoints, the same ANCOVA model outlined above for the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be used, with the respective baseline included as the covariate.  Baseline for TC, non- HDL -C, HDL -C, and VLDL -C will be defined as the average of the last 
two pre -dose values (generally will be the average of Visit S2 and pre -dose Study Day 1/Visit 
T1).  Baseline for fasting apolipoproteins, LDL -C (ultracentrifugation), LDL -TG, VLDL -TG, 
HDL -TG, hsCRP, IL -6, SAA, adiponectin, fibrinogen, and ANGPTL4 is defined as the value 
from pre -dose Study Day 1/Visit T1.  For the EOS time point, EOS will be defined as the 
average of Week 10 and Week 12.  If either the Week 10 or Week 12 value is missing, then the single value ( Week 10 or Week 12) will be used.  Completely missing values (both Week 10 and 
Week 12) will be imputed using LOCF, with the last on- treatment value carried forward as the 
EOS value.  For all other time points, missing values will be imputed using LOCF, wi th the last 
on-treatment value carried forward to that time point.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 60 confidence intervals and p- values will be presented to compare gemcabene 300 mg and 600 mg 
separately with the placebo group.    
The exploratory efficacy analyses will be repeated using the PPS.  
9.3.2 Analysis of Safety  
Safety will be assessed using the SAS. The assessment of safety will include adverse events, 
clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs. In addition, the 
safety assessment will be based primarily on the frequency of new or worsening adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and serious adverse events ( SAEs ). Other safety data will be 
summarized as appropriate.  
AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  The summarization of AEs will include only treatment- emergent AEs 
(TEAEs), defined as AEs  that begin or worsen after randomization and ingestion of the first dose 
of study drug. TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC), severity, and 
relationship to study drug for each treatment group. Deaths, withdrawal from study treatme nt due 
to AEs, and withdrawal from the study due to AEs will each be summarized by treatment group.   
Safety laboratory data will be summarized by treatment group at baseline, and at each post -
baseline time point, if applicable, and change from baseline to  End of Treatment (Week 12) or 
the ET Visit, if applicable. Baseline for safety laboratory data will be defined as the last pre -dose 
value (pre-dose Study Day 1/Visit T1 or prior).  Frequency counts of new or worsening 
abnormalities will also be provided. Vital signs data (value and change from baseline, where appropriate) will be summarized by 
treatment group at baseline and at each post -baseline time point.  Baseline for vital signs data 
will be defined as the last pre-dose value (pre -dose Study Day 1/Visit T1 or prior). Abnormalities 
in ECGs and in PEs will be summarized.  
All safety data will be listed.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 63 11 INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS AND QUALITY CONTROL  
11.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve human subjects . Compliance 
with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of study 
subjects  are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and that the clinical study data are credible.  
11.2 Institutional Review Board/ Ethics Committee  
Federal regulations and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) require that 
approval be obtained from an Institutional Review Board  (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)  prior to 
participation of subjects  in research studies. The IRB /EC will review all appropriate study 
documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety, and well -being of subjects . The study will 
only be conducted at sites where IRB /EC approval has been obtained. The protocol, 
Investigator’s Brochure, Informed Consent Form (ICF) , advertisements (if applicable), written 
information given to the subjects , safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to 
these documents will be provided to the IRB /EC by the Investigator. 
Prior to study onset, the protocol, any protocol amendments, ICFs, advertisements to be used for 
subject  recruitment, and any other written information regarding this study being  provided to a 
subject  or subject ’s legal guardian must be approved by the IRB /EC. 
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB /EC authorization has been 
received by the Sponsor, or designee. 
11.3 Informed Consent  
The ICF and any changes to the ICF made during the course of the study must be agreed to by 
the Sponsor  or designee and the IRB /EC prior to i ts use and must be in compliance with all ICH 
GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  
The Investigator , or a person delegated the responsibility by the Investigator, must ensure that 
each study subject (or legally acceptable representative)  is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation and must ensure that the 
subject  has been informed of his/her rights to privacy. The Investigator or delegate will allow the 
subject  adequ ate opportunity to read the written informed consent and ask any questions. The 
Investigator will obtain written informed consent from each subject before any study -specific 
activity is performed and should document in the source documentation that consent  was 
obtained prior to any study -specific activity . The original signed copy of the ICF must be 
maintained by the Investigator and is subject  to inspection by a representative of the Sponsor , 
their representatives, auditors, the IRB /EC and/or regulatory agencies. A copy of the signed ICF 
will be given to the subject.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 64 11.4 Study Monitoring Requirements  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with 
the protocol, ICH GCP, Directive 2001/20/EC, applicable regulatory requirements, and the Declaration of Helsinki (Seoul 2008) and that valid data are entered into the eCRFs. 
The role of the study monitor is to verify the rights and well- being of the subjects  are protected, 
the data is accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents, and the conduct of the 
study is in compliance with the protocol, Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, and applicable 
regulatory requirements. To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Invest igator and, at the same time, 
the Sponsor  in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized and easily retrievable data. 
Before the enrollment of any subject in this study, the Sponsor  or their designee will review with 
the Investigator and site pers onnel the following documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, 
eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed consent process, management of 
investigational product, and the procedure for reporting adverse events such as  SAEs.  
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor  or their designee to monitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. 
During the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is entered by the site, the CRA will review the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor 
and provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by signature and date on the study -specific monitoring log  
and findings documented in a follow- up letter . 
11.5 Disclosure of Data  
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection by the FDA, the Sponsor or their designee, applicable foreign health authorities, and the IRB /EC as appropriate. Subjects  or their 
legal representatives may request their medical information be given to their personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for their welfare. 
Subject  medical information obtained during the study is confidential and disclosure to third 
parties other than those noted above is prohibited. 
11.6 Retention of Records  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator 
will keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects  (sufficient information to 
link records, e.g., eCRFs and hospital records), all original signed ICFs , copies of all eCRFs, 
SAE  forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records should 
be retained by the Investigator  accor ding to specifications in the ICH guidelines, local

c. Study assessments will be completed ±3 days of given time point for all study visits from Study Day 1  through Week 10 . Week 12  assessments can be performed up to 3 
days prior to Study Day 8 5, but not after Study Day 8 5. 
d. The Follow -up Visit will be conducted as a telephone call 4 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug, unless the subject  requires a site visit due to  an abnormal 
result at Week 12  (or the ET Visit, if applicable) or an ongoing treatment -related adverse event . 
e. Procedures will be performed pre -dose. The Investigator will inquire with the subject  at Study Day 1  to determine if there have been any changes in the subject ’s health 
affecting eligibility or requiring an update t o their medical and surgical history.  
f. For subjects  who required a Wash-Out Period and completed the Pre-Screening Visit, the following Screening Visit procedures will not be repeated: informed consent, 
full physical examination, height, TSH, H bA1c, and ser ology (HBV, HCV, and HIV) screening.  Updates, as needed, will be made to medical/surgical history, 
demographics, and concomitant medications.   
g. A full physical examination includes genitourinary examination per the Investigator’s discretion and does not include a rectal examination.  
h. Only f or subjects  who required a Wash-Out Period and completed the  full physical examination at the  Pre-Screening Visit . 
i. Only for subjects  who had an abnormal result at Week 12  (or the ET Visit, if applicable) or an ongoing tr eatment -related adverse event .  
j. Vital signs include pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature.  Blood pressure should be obtained in the seated position, after the subject  has rested 
comfortably for at leas t 5 minutes. Blood pressure at the Screening Visit  should be obtained in both arms and the arm with the highest value should be used for ongoing 
monitoring throughout the rest of the study. If an automated assessment is performed, t he same machine should be used for the subject  throughout the study  when 
possible . Care should be taken to ensure an appropriate cuff size is utilized.  
k. Heig ht will be measured only at the subject ’s first study visit, either at the Pre-Screening Visit or the Screening Visit. 
l. Urine will be collected for a full urinalysis at the lab including protein:creatinine ratio  and albumin:creatinine ratio  at the Prescreening/screening  Visit, Study Day 1 , 
Week 6 , Week 12 , the Follow -up Visit (o nly for subjects  who had an abnormal result at Week 12  [or the ET Visit, if applicable]  or an ongoing treatment -related adverse 
event ), and the ET Visit, if applicable . Urinary NGAL  will be measured at Study Day 1 , Week 6, Week12 , the Follow -up Visit (only for subjects  who had an abnormal 
result at Week 12  [or the ET Visit, if app licable] or an ongoing treatment -related adverse event), and the ET Visit, if applicable.  
m. For women of child-bearing potential only, a serum pregnancy test will be conducted at the Screening Visit, Week 12 , and the ET Visit, if applicable. A urine pregnancy 
test will be conducted at the Pre- Screening Visit, Study Day 1 , Week 2 ,  Week 6 , and Week 10 .  
n. Clinically significant a bnormal creatinine results at Week 12  (or the ET Visit, if applicable) will also be followed -up 2 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug 
in addition to the 4  week (±3 days) Follow -up Visit. See Appendix B  for a list of analytes  and description of when repeat or reflexive testing will be required.  
o. Thyroid -stimul a ting hormone, HbA1c, and serology  (HBV, HCV, and HIV)  will be measured at the subject ’s first study visit, either at the Pre -Screening Visit, if 
applicable, or the Screening Visit.  
p. Includes non-HDL -C, TC, TG, HDL -C, and VLDL -C and HDL -TG. Fasting  will be defined as no food or caloric beverage for at least 10  hours prior to sample 
collection.  Subjects  will be permitted to have water, black tea or black coffee.

HEART FAILURE CLASSI FICATION  
• Class I: subjects with cardiac disease but without resulting limitation of physical activity. 
Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal 
pain. 
• Class II: subjects  with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They 
are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.  
• Class III: subjects  with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. 
They are comfortable at rest. Less t han ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, 
or anginal pain. 
• Class IV: subjects  with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity 
without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal  syndrome may be present even 
at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 77 APPENDIX E : MUSCLE INJURY AND HEPATIC MONITORING  
Muscle Injury  
Muscle injury  will be assessed using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms and 
laboratory data ( creatine kinase [ CK], hepatic, and renal function). 
All subjects  with suspected or confirmed muscle injury should be managed according to the 
standard of care at the discretion of the Investigator. 
• Subjects  with new or unexplained muscle symptoms should have an unscheduled visit 
scheduled within 7 days of site notification. At this visit, samples should be sent for a full 
chemistry panel, including CK, liver, and renal function. 
• Subjects  with CK elevations of >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) who are asymptomatic 
should be considered for an unscheduled visit  (+ isozyme s), based upon medical 
judgment. 
• All subjects  with CK elevations >10 × ULN should have an unscheduled visit  (+ 
isozymes) . Study drug should be temporarily discontinued, pending the results of an 
investigation  into the cause of muscle injury and/or CK elevation is complete.  
It is important that subjects  are instructed to not undertake any form of strenuous physical 
activity for at least 24 hours prior to repeat blood testing. 
Hepatic Monitoring  
Subjects  with hepatic enzyme elevations should be managed according to the standard of care, at 
the discretion of the Investigator. For subjects  with signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis, an 
unscheduled visit and a chemistry panel should be performed. Subjects  with a n alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT ) >2 × ULN with symptoms suggestive of hepatitis should have an 
unscheduled visit. Subjects with ALT >3  × ULN with or without symptoms should also have an 
unscheduled visit. A repeat assessment should be performed as soon as possible to confirm the 
finding. A clinical evaluation should be performed, including assessment of past medical history  
(including non- alcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis  and alcohol use)  and concomitant 
medications (including over the counter drugs and herbal supplements). Risk factors for hepatitis 
infection should be reviewed and hepatitis studies should be performed.  
Study drug should be temporarily discontinued during this evaluation if the subject  has signs or 
symptoms of hepatitis or an A LT >5  × ULN . The possible dosing re -initiation (re -challenge) or 
follow- up schedule for any events meeting these criteria will be determined by the Investi gator in 
consultation with the Medical M onitor. 
Recommended Hepatic Discontinuation Criteria  
Study drug should be discontinued permanently if one of the following occurs (as confirmed by 
repeat assessment) and if the event is without an alternative explanation : 
• ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  >8 × ULN;  
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks;

Version 4.0, 17 March  2017 78 • ALT or AST >3 × ULN and either total bilirubin >2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio >1.5; and/or 
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%). 
It is also recommended that statin regimen is discontinued. Abnormal values should be followed 
until they return within normal range or to a level deemed acceptable by the Investigator, or until 
the abnormality is explained by an appropriate diagnosis.

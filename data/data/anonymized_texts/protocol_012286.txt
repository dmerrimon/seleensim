Reference therapy:  Normal s aline solution  (saline placebo) and 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine  
Duration of treatment: Each  subject  will receive a single dose of study medication intra- operatively.  
Overview: Subjects will participate in the screening visit within 28 days of the scheduled surgery.  At that time, 
medical history, vital signs, physical examination , clinical laboratory tests , drug and alcohol screening,  12-lead 
ECG  testing  and collection of prior and concomitant medications, and a pregnancy test will be performed.  ASA 
classification and assessment of PONV risk factors will be assessed.  Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
eligibility, along with training the subject on pain assessment and place bo response will be performe d. 
On day of surgery, Day  0, subjects will be reassessed for eligibility and undergo the index procedure under general 
anesthesia.  No epidural or spinal anesthesia will be allowed, nor will any local anesthetic infiltration oth er than the 
administration of the IP or control be permitted.  No prophylactic antiemetic , local anesthetics,  or analgesic 
medications are allowed  other than those used with general anesthesia .   
Subjects will be dosed in each cohort as described above.  S tart and stop time of dosing will be recorded.  Dosing 
stop time will be considered T0.  
Subjects will be transferred to the post- anesthesia care unit and observed according to institutional standards.  While 
in the unit, subjects may receive morphine IV for pain control as needed as per local practice.  
A photograph of the surgical wound will be taken immediately after surgery, at 48 , 72, and 96 hours, and at Day s 10 
and 28. 
When subjects have met post -anesthesia care unit discharge criteria, they may be discharged to the clinic floor

where they will be housed until 7 2 hours post Time 0 and discharge procedures are performed.  
Pain scores at rest  will be assessed utilizing an 11 point (0– 10) numeric al pain rating scale (N PRS) 1, 2, 78, 84, and 
96 hours after administration of study medication (Time 0). In this N PRS scale, 0 -no pain experienced and 10 -worst 
pain imaginable.  
Pain scores will be measured on movement  (sitting up fr om a supine position) starting at Hour 4 and measured at 6, 
8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, and 72 hours.  Once subjects can tolerate oral medication, subjects may 
receive oral oxycodone or other comparable analgesic, as required for breakth rough pain every four to six hours as 
needed.  All medications taken by the subject and administered during surgery will be recorded and all adverse 
events noted throughout the study period.  Patients may receive acetaminophen 1000 mg for pain that is grad e 4 or 
lower.  A daily dose of acetaminophen must not exceed 4 grams (4000 mg) per day.  
Vital signs will be measured at Screening, Baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after administration of study medication (Time 0)  and at  Day 10 visit .  
Subject s will have a 12- lead ECG performed at screening, at baseline (i.e., at check -in on Day 0) and at 24, 48, 72,  
and 96 hours post -treatment .  Study personnel will assess subjects for adverse events which will include a 
neurologic evaluation for potential bupivacaine toxicity.  
Blood PK samples will be drawn prior to administration of the investigational product (IP), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, and 120 hours post -treatment. 
The subject will be assessed on Days 10 at the clinic  by physical exam, 12- lead ECG, vital signs,  and the wound 
assessed for healing  and at Day 28 assessed for wound healing .  Any adverse events and concomitant medications 
will be collected.  
Subjects will receive a ph one call from the study site on Day 60 and will be asked if they have any current pain 
related to the operation and to rate their pain intensity over the previous 24 hours using the NRS. Subjects will also be asked about their use of any pain medication ov er the previous 24 hours to treat pain related to the operation.

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION 
The use of local anesthetics within a surgical wound, i.e., “wound infiltration,” has found 
extensive use in a vast number of patients ( Renck 1994).  Medical opinion suggest s that such 
infiltration with local anesthetics may be a relatively simple and safe means to reduce post -
operative pain ( Moiniche, Mikkelsen et al. 1998).  The major limitation of the current local 
anesthetics used for infiltration is the limited duration of effect (6 –12 hours) that is observed 
following surgery ( Kehlet and Andersen 2011).  In recent years there has been a dramatic 
increase in day -case surgery.  In this patient population it is estimated that 30 to 40% of the 
patients suffer from moderate to severe pain during the first 24 to 48 hours.  The development of 
a long- acting local anesthetic formulation for this patient population would be of clinical 
significance ( Rawal 2001 ). 
While non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been used in the treatment of 
post- operative pain ( Moote 1992), there is early evidence that there may be a synergistic 
interact ion between local anesthetics and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory compounds when 
locally administered ( Ortiz, Castañeda- Hernández et al. 2011).  The Sponsor has identified a 
combination of bupivacaine and low dose meloxicam in a sustained release formulation (HTX -
011), intended for the management of post -operative pain via wound infiltration that has 
demonstrated positive results in a non- clinical model of post -surgical pain  and in an initial study 
in healthy volunteers with its first formulation HTX -011-19.  HTX -011 with the appropriate 
amount and combination of excipients has been selected for further clinical development.  Three  
distinctly different formulation s of HTX -011 have been composed for clinical evaluation: 
• HTX-011-19: t he vehicle formulation is tri[ethylene gly col] based poly[orthoester]  
polymer with N- methyl -2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and maleic acid.  
• HTX-011-49 t he vehicle formulation is tri[eth ylene glycol] based poly[orthoester]  
polymer with dimethyl sulfoxide  (DMSO) , glycerol triacetate, and maleic acid. 
• HTX-011- 56: the vehicle formulation is tri[ethylene glycol] based poly[orthoester] 
polymer with DMSO, glycerol triacetate, and maleic acid . 
The three formulations differ from each other solely on the basis of either the percentage content of the active ingredients (bupivacaine and meloxicam) and or the percentage content of excipients comprising the vehicle formulation.  The two  newer formulations , HTX-011-49 and 
HTX-011-56, were developed and incorporate two new excipients:  these formulation s improve 
the ease of delivery while maintaining the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of HTX-011-19. 
The Sponsor has also developed 2 formulation s, HTX-002 and HTX -009, which  are similar  in 
pharmaceutical composition to HTX-011-56 except  that they contain  only bupivacaine or 
meloxicam, respectively , as the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API).  Exploratory studies 
evaluating the antinociceptive effect in a post- operative pain model in domestic piglets and 
cross -over PK studies in the beagle dogs demonstrate that the primary pharmacodynamics and 
PK characteristics for HTX -002 are similar to that of HTX -011-56.  B oth the active ingredient s 
(bupivacaine and meloxicam ) and the identical biochronomer polymer vehicle have been studied 
in humans.

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective for Part A is to evaluate the efficacy and duration of analgesia following 
administration of  one of two doses of HTX-011- 19 by different techniques. 
The primary objective of Part s B through G will be to evaluate the efficacy and duration of 
analgesia following administration of HTX -011-49, HTX -011-56, HTX-002, HTX-009, 
bupivacaine (Marcaine) , or normal saline . 
The secondary objectives  to be evaluated in Parts A  through G are as follows : 
• To determine in Part A the optimal administration techniqu e of study drug  
• To determine the safety a nd tolerability of HTX -011, HTX -002, and HTX -009 as 
evaluated throug h physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and 
incidence of adverse events (AEs) and s erious AEs (SAEs)  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of bupivacaine and/or meloxicam in  
HTX-011, HTX -002, and HTX-009 over 120 hours  
• To evaluate the analgesic effects of HTX-011, HTX-002, and HTX -009 over various 
intervals using a series of secondary efficacy endpoints for pain intensity (such as the 
patient’ s global assessment of pain control, time to administration of first dose of rescue 
analgesia, and total and average daily rescue consumption ) 
• To assess the effects of HTX-011, HTX -002, and HTX-009 on wound healing at 72 hours 
and on Days 10 and 28 post- treatment  
• To evaluate nausea at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours post- treatment  
• To evaluate the percentage of subjects pain free over time

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, multi- center, single -dose, randomized, study in adult subject s undergoing 
unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy.  The  study will enroll up to approximately  453 subjects . 
Subject s at least 18 years of age requiring unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy will be 
screened for participation at the study sites in the United States within 28  days of  the planned  
surgery.  After signing the informed consent, subjects will be assessed for  medical history, 
PONV risk factors, physical examination, baseline  clinical  laboratory test s, drug and alcohol 
screen,  12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy testing, vital sign measurements, and  they 
will undergo pain and placebo assessment  training during the screening visit.  
On the day of surgery (Day 0),  after having been reassessed for eligibility,  subject s will undergo 
a unilateral  open inguinal herniorrhaphy  under general anesthesia.  No epidural or spinal 
anesthesia will be allowed, nor will any local anesthetic infiltration, other than the administration 
of the  investigational product  (IP), be permitted.  No prophylactic antiemetic , local anesthetics,  
or analgesic medications are allowed at any time.  A si ngle dose of study drug (either HTX-011, 
HTX-002, HTX-009, Marcaine, or saline, according to a randomization schedule) will be 
administered.   Start and stop time of dosing will be recorded.  Dosing stop time will be 
considered T ime 0. 
Following the completion of surgery and immediate postoperative recovery stay, subject s will be 
transferred to the unit.  Staff members at the unit will be blinded to study treatment.  Subject s 
will stay at the unit for approximately 72 hours after the administration of study medication and will return to the unit 96 and 120 hours after the administration of study medication to complete 
additional assessments.  Subject s will be scheduled to return on Day 10 for additional efficacy 
and safety assessments and Day 28 for an assessment of wound healing  and collection of AEs 
and concomitant medicati ons.  Part A of the study will determine the optimal technique of 
administrati on of study drug .  Efficacy assessments will include pain intensity scoring, use of 
rescue medication,  Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control , and assessments of nausea , 
and use of analgesia rescue medicine .  Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, 
physical examinations, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and wound healing assessments  and photographs of the surgical site.  Blood samples will be obtained to 
assess meloxicam and bupivacaine ph armacokinetics.  Subjects will also receive a phone call 
from the study site on Day 60 to collect follow -up information on postoperative pain and pain 
medications.  
3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control Groups  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of three  formulation s of the combination of a 
known local anesthetic, bupivacaine , and a known anti -inflammatory drug, meloxicam 
(HTX-011), via different administration techniques (injection into the  surgical wound and/or 
topical administration into the surgical wound).

replaced in this study after discussion with the investigator and at the discretion of the Sponsor. 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 28 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  Any subject who is randomly assigned to study drug but who discontinues the study prior to the 
study drug administration will be replaced by the next study subject who meets the study entry criteria.  The replacement subject will be assigned to the same study drug that was intended for 
the subject being replaced.  
4.4. Lifestyle Guidelines  
4.4.1. Confinement  
Prior to the surgical procedure ( Day 0 ), subject s will arrive at the study clinic in sufficient time 
to prepare for the procedure and confirm eligibility to participate in the study.  In Part  A of the 
study, appropriate ly qualified  subject s will be assigned randomly  to one of 5 treatment cohorts of 
HTX-011- 19 or  to saline during the unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy procedure.  In Part B, 
subjects will be assigned randomly to one of 4 treatment groups of either HTX -011- 49 or HTX -
011-56 or to saline , via the technique that was determined to be  optimal in Part A.  In Part C, 
subjects will be assigned randomly to one of the 9 treatment groups of HTX -002 or HTX -011, 
Marcaine, or to saline .  In Part  D, subjects will be assigned randomly to one of the 3 treatment 
groups of HTX -011-56 with or without  fentanyl administration at the conclusion of the case  and 
before study drug administration .  In Part E, subjects will be assigned randomly to one of the 2 
treatment groups of HTX -009 or normal saline.  In Part F, subjects will be assigned randomly to 
one of the 2 treatment groups of HTX -011- 56 or normal saline with fentanyl administration at 
the conclusion of the case and before study drug administration. In Part G, subjects will be 
assigned randomly to one of the 3 treatment groups of HTX -011- 56, Marcaine, or normal saline 
with fentanyl administration at the conclusion of the case and before study drug administration.  
(See Section  4.6 for more info rmation on treatment cohorts for each part of the study.)  Subject s 
will be discharged from the study clinic on Day 3, about 72 hours after receiving study medication.  They will be scheduled to return to the study clinic 24 hours later, i.e., approximatel y 96 hours, and at 120 hours aft er receiving study medication.  
Bathroom privileges will be restricted during the postoperative confinement period.  Following completion of the surgery, subjects will be restricted to use of a bedpan, bedside commode, or bathroom privileges via wheelchair  through completion of 12- hour assessments;  bathroom 
privileges may be loosened  at any time at the discretion of the investigator.   While confined at 
the study clinic following surgery, subject s will be required to remain resting in bed at least 5 
minutes prior to any pain intensity assessment.  Subject s will be allowed to ambulate according 
to standard postoperative care instructions. 
4.5. Surgical Procedure  
On the day of surgery (Day 0), subject s will undergo unilateral open inguinal hernia with tension 
free technique using implanted mesh .  Surgeries should be scheduled so as to allow for all 
surgical procedures to be completed by approximately 5:00 pm on the day of surgery.

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  4.5.1. Anesthesia Protocol and Administration of Study Medication 
4.5.1.1. Anesthesia  
The anesthetic protocol below is a guide that should be followed to minimize inter -subject  
variability to the greatest extent possible.  However, it is understood that hemodynamic 
fluctuations and other intraoperative events may necessitate some deviation from the standard regimen.  
The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia  according to local practices ; for 
example,  inducing s edation with up to 2 mg midazolam is permitted , or induction with propofol 
(and lidocaine to decrease injection pain from propofol is permitted) , and  fentanyl should be 
limited to no more than 100 micrograms.  Should intubation be required, non-depolarizing 
muscle relaxants may be used and reversed , if needed, per local practice.   Laryngeal mask airway 
(LMA ) placement is preferred over intubation.  Succinylcholine is not permitted.  Volatile 
anesthetics are to be used for maintenance of anesthesia, and nitrous oxide is not permitted.  No epidural or spinal anesthesia  will be allowed, nor will any local anesthetic infiltration, other than 
the administration of the IP , be permitted.  No prophylactic antiemetic s, local anesthetics , or 
analgesic medications are allowed at any time.  
4.5.1.2. Study Drug Administration (Parts A , B, C , F, and G ) 
Once the hernia repair is completed , study medication will be administered by local 
administration  into the surgical site utilizing either the technique of wound infiltration 
(“injection”), instillation (“topical”) , or both, depending on the study group assignment. 
Wound Infiltration  
For subjects receiving wound infiltration of study drug only: 
• Approximately 1/3 of the study drug is placed into the upper third of  subcutaneous tissue 
just above the level of the fascia,  
• Approximately 1/3 is placed immediately underneath the aponeurosis of the external 
oblique above the inguinal canal (taking care to avoid the nerves), and  
• Approximately 1/3 i s placed into the canal itself  
For the first two steps, it is expected that a number of intrusions of the needle will be necessary 
to cover the area.  
Instillation  
For subjects receiving the topical administration dosing cohort, the s tudy drug is prepared in the 
syringe and then evenly applied throughout the surgical wound prior to closure at both the level 
below a nd the level above the fascia.  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 30 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  Both  
For subjects receiving both wound infiltration and instillation, both of the above steps are to be 
followed. 
In all cases, start and stop time of dosing will be recorded; dosing stop time  will then be 
considered Time 0 (T0).  Details of an administration will be recorded on a worksheet which will 
be used in the dictation of the surgical notes and will become part of the source document. 
4.5.1.3. Study Drug Administration (Parts D and E) 
Once the he rnia repair is completed , study drug will be administered by local administration  into 
the surgical site using a “combination” technique comprising both wound infiltration 
(“injection”) and instillation (“topical”).  
Use approximately  ½ the study drug for wound infiltration . This portion of study drug 
should be administered as follows: 
• Approximately 1/3 of the study drug is placed into the subcutaneous tissue just  above the 
level of the fascia. 
• Approximately 1/3 is placed immediately underneath the aponeuros is of the external 
oblique above the inguinal canal (taking care to avoid the nerves). 
• Approximately 1/3 i s placed into the canal . 
For the first two steps, it is expected that a number of intrusions of the needle will b e necessary 
to cover the area.  
Use the remaining amount of study drug  for instillation : 
The s tudy drug is prepared in the syringe and then evenly applied throughout the surgical wound 
prior to closure at both the level below a nd the level above the fascia.  
In all cases, start and stop time of dosing will be recorded; dosing stop time will then be considered Time 0 (T0).  Details of an administration will be recorded on a worksheet , which 
will be used in the dictation of the surgical notes and will becom e part of the source document.  
4.5.2. Identity  of Study Medication 
Study drug is defined as HTX -011 (HTX -011- 19, HTX -011- 49, HTX -011-56) , HTX-002, HTX -

Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 36 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  All study doses  administered  will be according to the original treatment assignment.  Only the 
site staff directly involved in the surgery and the unblinded pharmacy staff will have acces s to 
the randomization scheme. 
Subject and s ite staff involved in the post- surgical  assessments of safety and efficacy will not 
have access to the randomization scheme and will be blin ded to study treatment.   
4.7. Selection of Doses  
To ensure analgesic efficacy is demonstrated and to better understand the dose response effect  of 
the HTX -011 formulations, 3 dose levels (200, 300, and 400 mg) will be evaluated in this study. 
HTX- 011 doses up to 600 mg have been evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies  and 
have been generally well tolerated .  
In a placebo -controlled Phase 1 clinical trial, single doses of 100 mg , 200 mg, and 400 mg  of 
HTX-011-19, and single doses of 100 mg  and 200 mg  mL of HTX -011-49 were administered to 
healthy  adult volunteers.  HTX -011 elicited  the desired pharmacokinetic profile for both 
bupivacaine and meloxicam.  Therapeutically relevant plasma bupivacaine levels were sustained 
for 2  to 3 days in the absence of large initial peak plasma concentrations that can be observed 
with commercially available formulations of the drug.  The anesthetic effects of HTX-011 
persisted through 96 hours, which closely correlated with plasma bupivacaine con centrations.  
All five doses were well -tolerated with no serious adverse events, clinically relevant ECG or 
laboratory changes, or premature discontinuations.  Mild redness and bruising were seen at some 
injection sites due to the subcutaneous administration of the product in this healthy volunteer 
study.  
4.8. Blinding and Unblinding of Study Medications  
Since HTX-011, HTX -002, and HTX -009 formulations are colored and viscous solutions 
whereas  saline and Marcaine are  not, and the volume administered varies with dose, this renders 
obsolete any double- blinded study drug administration.  Therefore, the site’s surgical and 
pharmacy staff will not be blinded to the study medication administered .  However , the conduct 
of the  study will be observer blind.  Once  surgery is completed and subject s have been 
transferred to the clinical unit, all site staff in the clinical unit involved in the assessment of safety and efficacy will be blinded to the treatment assignment, and (s)he will remain masked to treatment assignments throughout the conduct of this study.  The study blind may be broken only if the safety of a subject  is at risk and the treatment plan for that subject  depends on which study 
medication he or she received.  If knowledge of the treatment assignment is absol utely necessary 
for the management of a subject ’s safety,  the investigator must contact the medical monitor for 
unblinding information.  If a subject ’s data are unblinded without the prior knowledge of the 
sponsor, the investigator must notify the sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented. 
4.9. Treatment Compliance  
Since study medication is being administered  as a component of  the surgical procedure , a lack of 
treatment compliance is not expected .  The exact date, time, and dose of study medication 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 37 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  administration will be r ecorded in the subject’s eCRF.  It is important that all study medication is 
administered and that the syringes are emptied.  
4.10. Drug Accountability  
The investigator (or designee) will sign for the study medications when they are received.  The 
study medication must be handled and stored as described in the pharmacy manual and dispensed only to those subject s formally entered into the study. 
At the completion of the study and after reconciliation of all delivery and usage records, any unused study medication supplied by the sponsor  will be returned to the sponsor (or designee) or 
destroyed per written instructions from the sponsor. 
4.11. Packaging, Labeling, and Storage 
All study medication ( HTX -011, HTX-002, and HTX -009) will be prepared by the sponsor or 
the sponsor’s designee.  All study medication will be dispensed by the investigator or a person 
under his/her supervision and will be administered by the individual performing the surgery. 
4.11.1. Study Drug Packaging  
HTX-011, HTX -002, HTX-009 will be packed and dispatched in refrigerated shipping containers 
with a temperature monitor enclosed.  The lot number and a manufacturing date will be 
provided. 4.11.2. Study Drug Labeling  
HTX-011, HTX-002, HTX-009 labeling will comply with federal applicable laws and 
regulations.  At the minimum, the following information will be provided: 
• Study number (HTX-011-C2015-202) 
• Drug identification  
• Name, address , and telephone number of sponsor or manufacturer 
• Lot number 
• Contents of Package 
• Storage conditions  
• CAUTION: New Drug – Limited by United States Law to Investigational Use Only  
All HTX-011, HTX-002 , and HTX -009 formulations at the study site(s) should be stored in a 
refrigerator at 2 –8
oC.  The refrigerator should be in a locked area with restricted access.  A 
temperature log or chart should be maintained to monitor the environment at the study site. 4.12. Prior and Concomitant Medi cations 
All medications and other treatments taken by subject s within 30 days before dosing and during 
the study will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 38 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  All chronic medications that have not been at a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to the 
scheduled surgery procedure will be prohibited.  
4.13. Prohibited Medications  
The following medications are prohibited throughout the study: anticonvulsants, monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), neuroleptics, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) , gabapentin , and pregabalin , and administration of 
any of these agents, while participating in the study will disqualify the subject from the efficacy evaluation . 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) treatments are allowed if taken for at least 30 days 
before the screening period of the study at an unchanged stable dose. 
Analgesic medications other than those pre -specified for post -randomization rescue use 
(Section  4.15) are prohibited during the period from T0 to T 72 and the prohibited medications 
include, but are not limited to : hydromorphone, hydrocodone, codeine, fentanyl, meperidine, 
tramado l, opioid combinations, and NSAID s.  Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is also prohibited  
excluding low dose ASA for cardiac prophylaxis. Sedatives (including benzodiazepines) used as minor tranquilizers or hypnotics are not allowed 
unless approved by the investigator and the Sponsor’s medical monitor.  
Agents for post- surgical nausea prophylaxis , including 5- HT
3 receptor blockers  
(e.g.,  ondansetron) , scopolamine, dexamethasone, or hal operi dol, are prohibited during or upon 
completion of  the surgical procedure.  Anti -nausea medication will only be administered during 
the post -operative period for any of the following: (1) subject records a score of ≥  5 on the 
nausea numeric rating scale; (2) subject is actively vomiting; (3) subject requests anti-nausea medicati on. 
Note: Midazolam 1–2 mg IV may be administered preoperatively for anxiolysis . 
4.14. Concomitant Interventions and Procedures  
All interventions or procedures, whether diagnostic or therapeutic, and concomitant medications used for these interventions will be r ecorded in the eCRF, along with time, date, and reason for 
the intervention or procedure.  If an intervention or procedure is implemented to treat an AE, the event must be recorded as an AE, along with all relevant information. 
4.15. Rescue Medication  
Study inve stigators will review the HTX-011/HTX-002 I nvestigat or’s Brochure so as  to be 
aware of the safety related events which may be anticipated with its use.  Investigators will be 
versed in the latest standard of care guidelines.  A fully stocked emergency cras h cart, oxygen, 
and personnel trained in emergency resuscitation will be available at the study center at all times during the confinement period.  Pain intensity assessments (N PRS) must  be completed prior to 
each dose of rescue medication.  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 39 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  Rescue analgesia ( from T0 to T72) will be available to subject s with inadequately controlled pain 
symptoms.  The approved rescue regimen will be morphine 2 mg IV bolus dos es by titration as 
needed in the post- anesthesia care area.  Once effective analgesia has been reached using the 
morphine administered, subject s will be tran sitioned to oral oxycodone 10 mg every  4–6 hours, 
as needed for analgesia.  Additional morphine 2 mg IV every 2  hours may be administered for 
inadequate analges ia with oxycodone.  A subject who indicates a PI score that is ≤  4 may be 
given  acetaminophen 1000 mg for analgesia;  however, a daily dose of acetaminophen must not 
exceed 4 grams (4000 mg). 
Efforts should be made to encourage subject s to wait at least 60 minutes after the end of study 
drug admini stration prior to receiving rescue medication .  Subject s do not need to have a 
qualifying pain score to receive rescue analgesia; however, whenever possible staff should try to 
ensure that rescue analgesia is administered only when the numerical pain intensity rating score  
prior to rescue is NPRS ≥ 4. 
Between T72 (i.e., after discharge from the research unit) and T96, pain medication (if needed) will be prescribed according to the investigator’s discretion and institutional standard of care. 
After T96, PI scores will not be recorded: subjects may resume standard of care pain medication 
as advised by their surgeon.  This may include, but is not limited to, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, 
opioids, or opiate/APAP combo medication, if still needed.  The name, dose, reason, route , and 
time of administration of analgesics consumed after T96 will be recorded at the time of Day 10 visit to the study center.  
Subjects who do not achieve adequate analgesia from t he rescue regimen or experience 
intolerable opioid- related side effects will be discontinued from study drug efficacy evaluations, 
and they can be administered the standard of care regimen of analgesics.  However, the subject 
must remain in the study for a ll planned visits (i.e., safety evaluations and for obtaining PK 
blood samples) until completion of participation in the study or early termination from the study for any other reason.

will not be conducted.  Medical history will be updated on Day  0 when the subject  reports for 
surgery, and the subject  will be interviewed to confirm that they continue to meet the required 
study inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 41 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  5.2.3. Physical Examination 
The investigator or designee will perform a physical examination (HEENT, cardiovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, dermatologic, and musculoskeletal systems) during the 
screening visit, at admission (Day 0 ) to the study site on the day of surgery, at 72  hours post 
dosing, and at the Day 10 visit.  Body weight and height will be measured, and BMI  
(Appendix D ) will be calculated during the screening visit; all other physical examinations will 
include weight only.  Weight does not need to be measured at 72 hours after administration of 
study medication.  
The neurologic examination includes a mental status exam and evaluation of cranial nerve, motor, sensory, and cerebellar function.  In addition, the findings will be summarized in a 
neurologic assessment.   The examiner will be asked to record whether the subject’s overall 
neurologic status is better, worse, or the same. 
The study investi gator should perform a physical examination (the extent of which is determined 
by the study investigator) at any time during the study if indicated by change in a subject ’s 
condition. 
5.2.4. Pain Intensity (PI)  
PI will be assessed by the subject  for their current  pain according to an 11- point NPRS (0-10) 
where 0 equates t o no pain and 10 equate s to the worst pain imaginable.   PI scores will be 
measured two ways: on movement and at rest. 
PI scores will be assessed utilizing an 11 point (0 –10) numeric al pain rating scale (N PRS) at the 
following time points: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 72, 78, 84, and 
96 hours post study drug administration.  Assessments performed at 78 and 84 hours will be 
performed by subject s on an out subject  basis.   PI assessments scheduled between 24:00 and 
06:00 must be collected, even if subjects are asleep  at the time of the assessment.    
Pain scores will be measured on movement  (sitting up from a su pine position) starting at Hour  4 
and measured at 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, and 72 hours. 
Pain Scores will be measured at rest  at 1, 2, 78, 84, and 96 hours after administration of study 
medication.  The pain score will be measured after the patient has been supine for a minimum of 
5 minutes and a resting  pain score has been obtained.  
There will be a ±  15 minute window allowed for the collection of each PI assessment  unless 
otherwise stated . 
PI will also be assessed within 5 minutes prior to administration of each dose of rescue analgesia and at time of early discontinuation (should it occur and only if the subject  was discontinued 
prior to 96 hour). 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 42 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  5.2.5. Patient Global Assessment of Pain Control ( PGA)  
Subject s will be asked to evaluate the performance of their study medication as a pain treatment 
in response to the following inquiry : “Overall, please rate how well your pain has been 
controlled during the last 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours since you rece ived study medication ?: 0-poor, 
1-fair, 2 -good, 3-very good, or 4- excellent.”  
The PGA of pain control will be completed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after study medication 
administration and at time of early discontinuation (should it occur and only if the subject  was 
discontinued prior to 96 hours post- treatment ). 
5.2.6. Nausea Assessment  
Nausea will be assessed during the study using an 11- point NRS where 0 equates to no nausea 
and 10 equates to the worst nausea imaginable.  Assessment of nausea will be completed  by 
subject s at the following time points: 6, 24, 48 , and 72 hours within a ±  15 minute window  
unless otherwise stated . 
5.3. Safety Assessments Description  
5.3.1. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
During the screening visit , on Day 0  during check- in, at 72  (± 1)  hours following study drug 
administration, and in the event of subject  early discontinuation, subject s will have blood 
samples collected for routine clinical laboratory testing as follows:  
• hematology: complete blood count consisting of white blood cell (WBC) and red bl ood 
cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and differential counts (total 
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes)  
• clinical chemistry tests: urea, glucose, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, aspartate  aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyltransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, 
calcium, total protein, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, and uric acid 
Additional urine or blood samples w ill be collected and tested as follows:  
• urine drug screen and alcohol breath test at the screening visit, and during admission to the study unit on Day 0.  Urine drug screen will include screening of (at minimum): 
cocaine, marijuana, opiates /opioids , amphe tamines, methamphetamines, phencyclidine 
(PCP), benzodiazepines, barbiturates, methadone, and oxycodone.  
• serum pregnancy test at the screening visit, and a urine pregnancy test at check -in on Da y 
0 (female subjects of child bearing potential only). 
Screening laboratory results will be used for assessing eligibility for randomization.  Clinical 
laboratory test done on Day 0 prior to surgery will be used as baseline reference and not for 
assessing study randomization eligibility.  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 43 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  5.3.2. Vital Sign Measurement s 
Resting vital signs will include resting blood pressure, resting pulse, respiratory rate, oral 
temperature, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2).  Resting tests must be obtained after 
resting (s eated/supine) for ≥  5 minutes. 
After the administration o f study medication, subject s will have vital signs (resting only) 
measured and recorded at the following times: 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours and at the Day 10 visit.  Vital signs will have a collection window of ± 15 minutes  unless 
otherwise stated . 
Actual times will be recorded for all events, and any deviation outside the specified ranges must be clearly documented in the subject’s study records . 
5.3.3. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed after the subject has been supine for at least 5 minutes and will 
be completed for all subject s at screening, at check -in on Day  (0) and at 24, 48, 72, 96 hours , and 
at the Day 10 visit and at time of early discontinuation.  12- lead ECG will be used to exclude 
subject s with a c linically significant abnormal ECG.  
The findings (i.e., classification as “normal ,” “abnormal not clinically significant,” or “abnormal 
clinically significant [ including heart block] ”) will be recorded in the subject ’s eCRF.  The ECG 
tracings will not be c ollected for Data Management.  
5.3.4. Surgical Wound Healing Evaluation 
The wound evaluator will be a blinded investigator or will be other medically qualified clinical site personne l  (S)he and will assess the surgical site to determine if healing is normal or 
abnormal at 72 hours, Day 10, and Day 28 or Early Termination, and record observations (Appendix F ) on the appropriate eCRF and source document.  Norm al is defined as expected 
post- surgical findings as assessed by a blinded investigator or other medically qualified clinical 
site personnel, including but not limited to wound dry, no dehiscence, no erythema, no drainage, mild bruising, oozing, and swellin g.  A normal finding will not be recorded as an AE. 
Photographs of the subject’s surgical site will be taken immedia tely after surgery, 48 and 
72 hours, Day 10, and Day 28 ( Appendix H ).  If a wound is assessed as having an abnormal and 
unexpected post-surgical finding, the finding will be recorded as an AE.  
5.3.5. Blood Sampling for Bupivacaine /Meloxicam Pharmacokinetics Analysis  
Blood samples for the pharmacokinetic analysis of bupivacaine and meloxicam will be collected at the following times: prior to surgery, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 
60, 72, 96, and 120 hours after study medication administration  (± 15 minutes  unless otherwise 
stated ). 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 44 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  5.3.6. Assessment of Adverse Events  
Physical examinations including neurologic and cardiovascular evaluations will be performed to 
determine if there are any changes in the patient’s condition from baseline as noted in the schedule of events.   Close attention should be given to conditions that may represent reported 
toxicities associated with bupivacaine including, but not limited to, perioral tingling, strange taste, visual and auditory disturbances, muscle twitching, seizure, acidosis, shortness of breath, bradycardia (heart rate < 50 bpm with symptoms), hypotension (BP <  90 mmHg or symptomatic 
decrease from baseline), low oxygen saturation (≤  90% for ≥  1 minute), and cardiac arr est.  
Adverse events and any interventions will be documented in the eCRF. 
5.3.6.1. Procedures for Blood Sampling and Further Handling for PK Analysis  
Blood samples for the assay of bupivacaine and meloxicam will be taken in Li -Heparin 
collection tubes (BD Vacutain er cat no 367886; 13 x 100 mm x 6.0 mL BD Vacutainer plus 
plastic plasma tube, additive lithium heparin).  Tube volume should allow collection of 6 mL 
blood.  Blood samples wi ll be stored at approximately 4 °C on ice until further processing which 
should start within 30 minutes after blood collection.  Processing of blood to plasma concerns 
centrifugation at 1500 g at a temperature between 0°C and 4°C and subsequent pipetting of the 
plasma layer into cryovial sample tubes for a maximum of 15  minutes.  Plasma  will be equally 
divided over 2 of these tubes.  Samples/tubes will be deep frozen (at approximately -20°C) prior

Blood samples and derived plasma samples must be properly labeled at every stage of the 
process.   Refer  to the Laboratory M anual for more details.  
5.3.6.2. Bioanalysis of Bupivacaine and Meloxicam 
The concentrations of bupivacaine and meloxicam in plasma will be determined using validated LC-MS/MS assays.   Concentrations will be calculated by interpolation from a ca libration curve.  
Quality control samples will be analyzed throughout the study.  Their measured concentrations 
will be used to determine between -run, overall precision, and accuracy of the analyses. 
5.3.6.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The plasma PK parameters for bupivacaine and meloxicam will be derived by noncompartmental analysis of the plasma concentration- time profiles.  The following pharmacokinetic endpoints 
will be defined: 
• The area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to time t of the last 
measured concentration above the limit of quantification (AUC
last) 
• The area under the plasma concentration -time curve from zero to infinity (AUC inf) 
• The maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
• The time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T max) 
• The termi nal elimination rate constant (λ Z) with the respective half -life (t ½)

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  6. ADVERSE EVENTS, SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENTS, AND SERIOUS SUSPECTED 
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE, SAE, or serious s uspected adverse reaction as provided in this protocol.  
During the study, when there is a safety evaluation, the i nvestigator or site staff will be 
responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol. 
6.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not considered causally associated with the use of the study medication.  Any abnormal laboratory 
value deemed clinically significant by the investigator, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported as an AE.  
Examples of an AE include the following: 
• significant or unexpected worsening or ex acerbation of the condition or indication under 
study 
• exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (e.g., abnormal physical examination 
finding) 
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study medication or 
a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unless 
nonserious or serious sequelae oc cur) 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
• medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE 
• anticipated day to day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• the disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur  with a greater 
frequency than expected for the subject’s condition 
• transient paresthesia that are considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to occur as a long -acting local anesthetic wears off)  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination and regardless of 
causality or seriousness, will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF beginning after administration of study medication through the Day 10 study visit. 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 49 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  6.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• It results in death or is life -threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred).  (This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, mi ght have caused death.) 
• It results in persistent or substantial disability or incapacitation.  (This criterion is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.) 
• It results in hospitalization.  
• It results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization. 
• It is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• It requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is serious when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent any of the other outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from baseline does not meet the definition of an SAE. 
Social or convenience admission to a hospital or prolongation of a hospitalization for social or  
convenience reasons not associated with the occurrence of an AE does not meet the definition of 
an SAE.  
6.2.1. Serious Adverse Events That Occur Before Administration of Study Medication  
Before administration of study medication, only SAEs assessed by the invest igator as related to 
study participation (e.g., related to study procedures or a change in existing therapy) will be transcribed onto the SAE reporting form and reported to the sponsor. 
6.2.2. Serious Adverse Events That Occur After Study Completion  
If an investi gator becomes aware of an SAE or death that occurs in a subject  more than 28 days 
of the subject ’s last study visit and that investigator considers the event to be related to the study 
medication, the investigator is obligated to report the SAE to the sponsor as outlined in 
Section  6.7. 
6.3. Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the adverse event was caused by the study drug.  For the pur poses of IND safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility”  means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 50 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  between the drug and the adverse event.  A su spected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
6.4. Definition of a Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A serious s uspected adverse reaction is any s uspected adverse reaction that is determined to be 
serious, based on the outcomes of a SAE described in Section  6.2; i.e. death, life -threatening, 
causes or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, causes a persistent of significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital abnormality/birth defect.  
6.5. Recording and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adver se Events  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE. 
6.5.1. Assess ment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study, using his or her clinical judgment.  The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF should be assigned to one of the following cat egories:  
• mild: an event that is easily tolerated by the subject , causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not interfere with everyday activities  
• moderate: an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities  
• severe: an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a term used to describe the intensity of a specific event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  The event itself, howeve r, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe 
headache).  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject’s or event’s outcome or on action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s l ife or 
functioning (see Section  6.2). 
6.5.2. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relations hip 
between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  For this study, adverse 
events that are considered by the Investigator to have a Possible, Probable, or Definite relationship to the investigational product are considered to be “related” to the investigational product; unlikely and unrelated are considered to be “not related” to the investigational product.  Sponsor assessment of causality may differ from Investigator assessment in accordance with FDA guidance, Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE studies. 
The investigator will assess the relationship to the study medication by using the following 
criteria:  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 51 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  • Definitely Related: An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The AE 
is most likely explained by stu dy drug.  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if possible) are 
positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study drug.  Another 
etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
• Probably Related: An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The AE is 
more likely explained by study drug than by another cause.  Dechallenge (if performed) 
is positive.  
• Possibly Related: An AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug.  The AE 
could have been due to another equally likely ca use.  Dechallenge is positive.  
• Not Related: The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no temporal 
relationship to study drug OR the AE has a much more likely alternate etiology OR the AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug. 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before transmitting the SAE reporting form and completing the AE eCRF page(s).  The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  The investigator may change his or her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and 
amend the SAE reporting form and AE eCRF page(s) accordingly. 
6.5.3. Assessment of Outcome  
All SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the condition stabilizes, the events are 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator will assess the outcome 
of the event by using the following terms:  
• Resolved: The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae.  An event (either 
serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject experienced no restrictions.  Examples include stent placemen t for coronary artery disease (a device 
implanted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a sequela), a postoperative wound infection, or an upper respiratory tract infection. 
• Resolved with sequelae: The event has at least one secondary outcome t hat may result in 
permanent disability, functional limitation, or both.  Such sequelae are usually limited to SAEs.  Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or emboli formation after a bacterial infection resulting in a renal infarct and loss of renal function. 
• Not resolved: At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown.  
Examples include headache, low- grade fever, or nausea.  
• Unknown: The subject has withdrawn from the study p rematurely or is lost to follow -up, 
and the status of the event is unknown. 
• Death  
6.5.4. Assessment of Expectedness  
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, adverse events and suspected adverse events should be assessed as being expected or unexpected.  An AE or s uspected adverse r eaction is considered 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 52 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application . 
6.6. Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until an appropriate resolution can be documented. 
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow ea ch subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition.  All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact and  designated as ongoing and will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits or contacts. 
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator will ensure that follow -up 
information provided to the sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investi gations, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals 
that serve to clarify the nature of the event, the cause of the event, or both. 
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE reporting form 
and entered into the eCRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator.  The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  6.7. 
6.7. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, he or she must notify the sponsor within 24 hours.  
ANY SAE OR ANY OUTCOME OF DEATH DUE TO ANY CAUSE WHICH OCCURS DURING THE COURSE OF THIS STUDY, REGARDLESS OF RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY MEDICATION, MUST BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR IMMEDIATELY (within 24 hours).

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  In the initial e -mail, the investigator must provide to the sponsor the following eCRF pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible:  
• AE record  
• medical history  
• prior and concomit ant medications  
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE.  
E-mail transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information.  In rare circumstances 
and in the absence of e -mail capacity, notification by fax or telephone is acceptable, with a copy 
of the SAE reporting form sent by overnight mail.  Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete the SAE reporting form and eCRF pages within the time frames outlined.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he or she must not wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event.  The form must be updated when additional information is received.  Follow -up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the sponsor by using the same procedure and timelines as for an initial report.  
6.8. Regulatory Reporting Requirements 
The investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the  procedures 
detailed in Section  6.7, “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor.”  The 
sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the appropriate pr oject contact for SAE receipt is 
essential so that serious s uspected adverse r eaction that are either unexpected or observed with 
increasing occurrence be reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects ar e met.  
Investigator letters are prepared according to sponsor policy and are forwarded to the investigators as necessary.  An investigator letter is prepared for any s uspected adverse r eaction 
that is attributable to study medication, serious, and unexpected.  The purpose of the investigator letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. 
6.9. Precautions  
Any subject  who becomes pregnant during the study must be discontinued immediately but 
should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy.  A subject  should also 
notify the investigator if she becomes pregnant within 28 days after receiving study medication.  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 54 of 83

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  7. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of up to approximately 453 subjects ( 108 subject s for Part A , 90 subjects for 
Part B , 135 subjects for Part C , 45 for Part D, 20 for P art E , 20 for Part F , and 35 for Part  G) for 
this study was selected empirically without a formal statistical assumption.  
7.2. Study Endpoints  
7.2.1. Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the SPI 0-24. 
Secondary efficac y variables will include the following:  
• SPI at various other time points ( SPI 0-6, SPI 0-12, SPI 12-24, SPI 24-48, SPI 0-48, SPI 48-72, SPI 0-72, 
SPI 72-96, and SPI 0-96). 
• The Patient global a ssessment (PGA) of pain control at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours  post-
treatment . 
• Time to administration of first dose of rescue analgesia.  
• Total and average daily rescue consumption over 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post- treatment . 
• Mean nausea assessment scores at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours post- treatment . 
• The percentage of s ubjects who remain  pain free  (Numerical Pain Rating Scale ≤ 1) at 72 
hours and at 96 hours after study drug administration.  
7.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
The plasma PK parameters for bupivacaine and meloxicam will be derived by non -
compartmental analysis of the plasma concentration -time profiles.  The following 
pharmacokinetic endpoints have been defined: 
• The area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to time t of the last 
measured concentration above the limit of quantification (AUC last) 
• The area under the plasma concentration -time curve from zero to infinity (AUC inf) 
• The maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
• The time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T max) 
• The termi nal elimination rate constant (λ Z) with the respective half -life (t ½) 
7.2.3. Safety Endpoints 
The safety endpoints will include the following: 
• wound assessment findings  
• vital signs  
• clinical laboratory tests, including routine blood chemistry and hematology 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 56 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  • ECG findings 
• AEs and SAEs  
7.3. General Considerations for Statistical Analysis 
7.3.1. Analysis Datasets  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: The ITT set will include all subject s who are randomize d to 
receive study medication.  
Efficacy Set: The efficacy analysis set will include all subject s who are randomized to receive 
study medication an d have recorded at least one post dosing PI scores.  This analysis set is noted 
as the modified Intend- to-Treat (mITT) set.  
Safety Set: The safety set will include all treated subjects and will be used for safety  and 
tolerability assessments.  
7.3.2. Test Hypothes is and P Value Justification 
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between  each comparison (pairwise or pooled 
group comparison) .  The alternative hypothesis is  there is a difference for the comparison . 
Each pairwise or pooled group comparison will be evaluated via 2 -sided 2 -sample t -test at the 
0.05 level of significance.  Nominal p value will be reported without adjustment for multiplicity.  
7.3.3. Procedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise (see Section  7.3.3.1  and 7.3.3.2), no imputation will be done for 
missing data . 
7.3.3.1. PI Score Before and After Analgesic Rescue Medication  
All subject s are expected to assess their postoperative pain intensity according to the pain 
intensity schedule; those PI assessments are referenced as the scheduled PIs.  Subject s who 
require rescue analgesia are expected to report their pain intensity immediately before taking the 
rescue medication; this PI is referenced as the pre- rescue PI.  The duration of analgesic effect 
will be determined for the rescue medication (e.g., the anal gesic window for one oxycodone 10 
mg tablet is 6 hours); this analgesic duration is referenced as the analgesic window of this rescue 
medication.  When the assessment of a scheduled PI is done after the rescue medication and the time is within the analgesic window (inclu sive) of the rescue medication, the scheduled PI score 
will be replaced by the pre- rescue PI score for the purpose of efficacy analysis.  This method is 
referenced as the Windowed Last Observation Carried Forward (WLOCF).  The original scheduled PI scores will be displayed on data listing along with the “imputed” PI score.  
7.3.3.2. Other Missing PI Score(s)  
After the scheduled PI scores are appropriately replaced by the pre- rescue PI score for all 
subject s who had rescue medication based on the WLOCF method, if ther e are additional time 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 57 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  points where the PI scores are missing, the standard LOCF method will be used to impute the 
missing PI score.  All imputed PI scores will be clearly marked on data listings.  
Additional missing data imputation methods may be used to as sess the robustness of the efficacy 
data.  The details will be discussed in the statistic al analysis plan for the study.  
7.3.4. Derived Variables  
Prior to data base lock, a complete statistical analysis plan will be developed which will describe in detail the calculation of all efficacy variables . 
7.3.4.1. Study Population Summaries  
Population summaries will be provided for the safety analysis set included in this study. 
7.3.5. Disposition  
The summary tables will provide frequency counts for subject disposition (all treated subject s, 
subject s who completed the study, subject s who discontinued from the study, and reason for 
discontinuation) by treatment group and study overall. 
Disposition in terms of number of subject s excluded from each analysis sets (mITT, safety) will 
also be provided by treatment groups and study overall. 
7.3.6. Demographics 
The demographic summary will include descriptive statistics for age, sex, race, weight, height, 
and BMI for the overall and by treatment group.  
7.3.7. Protocol Violations 
All protocol violations and deviations will be identified.  Tabulation may  be provided if data  is 
warranted . 
7.3.8. Treatment Compliance  
Since study medication is administered intra -operatively, no formal summary of treatment

7.4.1. SPI and PI Analyses  
The analyses of the primary and all secondary endpoints will be described in  the statistical 
analysis plan.  
7.4.2. Time to First Dose of Rescue Medication  
A description of the analysis of time to first dose of rescue medication will be presented in the 
Statistical A nalysis P lan. 
7.4.3. Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Pain Control 
Number and percent of subjects in each global pain control category (0- poor, 1- fair, 2 -good, 3-
very good, or 4- excellent) will be tabulated by treatment group.  The difference between the 
groups in global pain control will be evaluated based on proportion of subjects rated their pain control as good, very good, or excell ent using Fisher’s exact test.  
7.4.4. Proportion of Subject s Requir ing Rescue Medication  
The analysis will evaluate the relative risk ( each HTX-011 formulation vs. saline, each HTX -011 
formulation vs. Marcaine , HTX-011- 56 vs. HTX-002, and HTX-009 vs. saline ) to require rescue 
medications during the treatment phase of the  study.  Proportion of subjects that used rescue 
medications at least once will be tabulated by treatmen t group; treatment group difference s will 
be assessed as described in  the S tatistical A nalysis P lan.

8.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 
8.1.1. Regulatory Authority Approval 
The sponsor will obtain approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regul atory agency in 
accordance with any applicable country specific regulatory requirements before any site may 
initiate the study in that country.  
8.1.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study and Ethics Approval  
This study will be conducted according to GCP; US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50 (Protection of Human Subjects); US 21 CFR Part 56 (IRBs); US 21 CFR Part 54 (Financial Disclosure); Inte rnational Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidance for Industry, E6 GCP: 
Consolidated Guidance; the Nuremberg Code; and, where applicable the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Recommendations guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects), and with the NH&MRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007). 
8.1.2.1. Ethics Committees  
The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the 
site’s informed consent form, and any other information that will be presented to potential subjects (e.g., advertisements or information that supports  or supplements the informed consent 
form) are reviewed and approved by the appropriate IRB or IEC.  The investigator agrees to allow the IRB or IEC direct access to all relevant documents.  The IRB or IEC must be constituted in accordance with all applica ble regulatory requirements.  The sponsor will provide 
the investigator with relevant documents or data needed for IRB or IEC review and approval of the study.  Before investigational products can be shipped to the site, the sponsor must receive copies of the IRB or IEC approval, the approved informed consent form, and any other information that the IRB or IEC has approved for presentation to potential subject s. 
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other information that the IRB or IEC has approved for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where applicable, these amended documents.  The investigator must follow all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to the use of an amended informed consent form, including obtaining IRB or IEC approval of the amended form, before new subjects consent to take part in the study using the new version of the form.  The investigator must promptly forward to the sponsor copies of the IRB or IEC approval of the amended informed consent form or other information and the approved amended informed consent form or other information.  IRB or IEC approval of the consent forms must be obtained in addition to the approval given for the clinical study.  Regulatory review and approval may be required in some countries before IRB or IEC approval can be sought. 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 61 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  8.1.2.2. General Considerations  
The ethical standards defined within GCP are intended to ensure the followi ng: 
• Human subjects are provided with an adequate understanding of the possible risks of 
their participation in the study, and they have a free choice to participate or not. 
• The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in such a 
way as to ensure the integrity of the findings. 
• The potential benefits of the research justify the risks. 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. is the sponsor of study HTX -011-C2015-202.  The sponsor (or its 
designee) is responsible for all of the following: 
• selectin g qualified investigators  
• providing investigators with the information they need to conduct the investigation properly 
• ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation 
• ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all participating investigators are properly informed of significant new information regarding AEs or risks associated with 
HTX-011, HTX -002, or HTX-009. 
8.1.3. Informed Consent  
The sponsor (or its designee) will provide investigators with a multicenter informed consent 
form for this study.  Investigators may adapt the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required elements of informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part 50.25).  The final informed consent form must be accepted by the sponsor and approved by the IRB or IEC.  Investigators must provide the sponsor with an unsigned copy of 
the final informed consent form before and after it is approved by the IRB or IEC.  If any new information becomes available that might affect subject s’ willingness to participate in the study, 
or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed consent form, the sponsor will provide investigators with a revised informed consent form.  The IRB or IEC must provide written approval of any revisions to the informed consent form in advance of its use. 
Investigators must provide subject s with all the information necessary to make an informed 
decision about their participation in the study, including the nature and intended purpose of the 
study, possible benefits, and possible risks. 
All information in the informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether written 
or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical and that is understandable to the subject s. 
Before written informed consent is obtaine d, the subject  should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study.  All questions must be answered to the satisfaction of the subject (or his or her legally authorized representative). 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 62 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  Before a subject  undergoes procedures  specific to the protocol, the informed consent form must 
be signed and dated by the subject  (or his or her legally authorized representative) and any other 
signatories as required by the IRB or IEC. 
If a subject (or legally authorized representative) cann ot read, a short form approved by the IRB 
or IEC may be used.  Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the 
representative.  However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign the copy of the summary in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27 (b2). 
After all required signatures have been obtained, a copy of the informed consent form should be 
provided to the subject , and the original must be kept on file at the sit e and made available for 
review by the sponsor.  Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the subject’s case history.  
8.1.4. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The investigator is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and a ccurate eCRFs and 
source documentation.  Source documentation constitutes original records (first point of entry, either hard copy or electronic), which may include progress notes, medication administration records, operation reports, laboratory reports, discharge summaries, and so on. 
8.2. Study Monitoring  
The sponsor (or its designee) is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with 
regard to subject  protection, ethics, protocol adherence, site procedures, and integrity of the data.  
At regular  intervals during the study, the sponsor’s study monitors will contact the study site via 
visits to the site, telephone calls, and letters in order to review study progress and eCRF completion and to address any concerns or questions regarding the study conduct.  During monitoring visits, the following aspects of study conduct will be carefully reviewed: subjects’ informed consent documents, subject  recruitment procedures, subject s’ compliance with the 
study procedures, source -data verification, drug accoun tability, use of concomitant therapy by 
subjects, AE and SAE documentation and reporting, and quality of data. 
8.3. Quality Assurance 
The sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IRB representative may visit the study site at any time 
during the study or after completion of the study to perform audits or inspections.  The purpose of a sponsor audit or regulatory inspection is to examine systematically and independently all study related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted according to the protocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, and any other applicable regulatory requirements.  Investigators should contact the sponsor immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection at their site. 
8.4. Study and Site Closure  
If the s ponsor, investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study site should be

study 
• submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the sponsor, 
study monitor, or regulatory agencies 
• failure of the investigator to comply with GCP (e.g., ICH guidelines, regulatory agency guidelines) 
• insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of missing, 
erroneous, or improperly collected data 
• evidence from the blinded data of sufficient technical problems with the study that one 
could believe with a high degree of certainty that subject s are being exposed to the 
investigational drug without a realistic expectation of evaluable data  
• a decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing evaluation or development of the product 
• failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate  
8.5. Records Retention  
8.5.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

Body Mass Index Calculations 
 
Body Mass Index =  Weight in kilograms  / (height in meters)2 
Meters  = inches  × 0.0254 
Kilograms  = pounds × 0.45 
 Example : 
For a man who weighs 165 pounds and is 71 inches tall: 165 lbs. × 0.45 = 74.25 kg  
71 in. × 0.0254 = 1.8 m 74.25 / (1.8 × 1.8) = 22.92 kg/m

Page 10PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Indication:
Human papillomavirus (HPV) -negative, cetuximab -naïve, recurrent/metastatic (R/M) 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) after failure of one platinum -based 
chemotherap y regimen.
Background and Rationale:
SCCHN is the sixth most common cancer.  Globally , approximately  600,000 new cases occur 
yearly.  In the United States (US) , it is estimated that about 55,000 new cases of oral cavity , 
phary ngeal, and lary ngeal cancers will occur in 2014, which account for about 3% of new 
cancer cases. 
Epidermal growth factor rec eptor (EGFR ) overexpression is found in approximately  90% of 
SCCHN cases, and it is associated with decreased progression
-free survival (P FS) and 
overall survival ( OS).  EGFR -directed drugs include antibodies that prevent ligand -binding 
and/or receptor dimerization (eg ,cetuximab) and small molecule adenosine 
triphosphate- competitive inhibitors of the intrinsic catal ytic activit y of ErbB receptors
(eg,erlotinib and gefitinib). 
Important regulatory proteins involved in the cell cycle transition from G1 to the S -Phase are 
cyclin D1 (CCND1 ), p16INK4 A(thereafter referred to as p16) and cyclin -dependent kinase s
(CDK s). Deregulation of aspects of the c ell-cycle, including CDKs, have been shown to 
contribute to the development of cancer. Overexpression of cy clin D1 and inactivation of 
p16 occur in the vast majority of cases of HPV -negative SCCHN.  Genomic characterization 
of oral SCCHN identified amplif ication of CCND1 and/or loss of CDKN2A (encoding p16 
protein) were found in 94% of tumors, supporting the observation that cell cy cle alterations 
were a nearl y universal feature .
Palbociclib is a highly  selective, reversible oral inhibitor of cy clin-depend ent kinases 4 and 6 
(CDK 4/6). The compound prevents cellular deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) sy nthesis by  
prohibiting progression of the cell cy cle from G1 into S phase.  In clinical trials, palbociclib
enhanced tumor response to letrozole in women with HR-positive, HER2- negative metastatic 
breast cancer .  Palbociclib also has efficacy  in cy clin D1 overexpressing mantle cell 
lymphoma and has activity  in a broad range of other solid tumors .
Combinatorial efficacy  was observed following treatment with palbocicl ib and inhibitors of 
the EGFR pathway , including cetuximab, in preclinical models.  In a panel of 24 SCCHN 
cell lines the p albociclib combination with c etuximab produced s ynergistic growth inhibition 
in 50 % of models. The combination of palbociclib and c
etuximab in a subset of these cell 
lines demonstr ated increased inhibition of retinoblastoma protein and downstream
transcription factor E2F signaling, leading to greater inhibition of new DNA sy nthesis and 
increased hallmarks of cellular senescence than w ith each agent alone. In vivo studies in 
patient -derived xenografts demonstrated the ability  of either single agent to produce 
>90% tumor growth inhibition in distinct models, and in a model that failed to show 
significant response to either single agent, the combination of palbociclib and c etuximab 
yielded s ynergistic tumor growth inhibition .

A5481044Final Protocol Amendment 2, 31 March 2016
Page 11In an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of escalating doses of palbociclib added to fixed-dose 
cetuximab, one partial tumor response was observed in a patient with SCCHN resistant to cetuximab and cisplatin.  Disease control (partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]) occurred in 6 of the 7 evaluable patients. Of the 6 patients with cetuximab-resistant SCCHN, 5 experienced disease control with combined palbociclib + cetuximab treatment. Of the 4 patients with cisplatin-resistant SCCHN, 3 experienced disease control with palbociclib + cetuximab.
The current Phase 2 study provides the opportunity to test the hypothesis that the addition of 
palbociclib to cetuximab will improve outcomes in patients with platinum-resistant, incurable SCCHN in a direct, double-blind comparison to cetuximab.
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
To demonstrate that the combination of palbociclib with cetuximab is superior to
cetuximab in prolonging OS in HPV-negative, cetuximab-naïve patients with R/M SCCHN in whom one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy has failed.
Secondary Objectives:
To compare secondary measure of efficacy between the treatment arms;
To compare safety and tolerability between the treatment arms;  
To compare Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) measures between the treatment arms;
To characterize the correlations between baseline biomarker (eg, p16, Rb) expression
in tumor tissue and clinical efficacy in both treatment arms;
To characterize steady state trough concentrations for palbociclib, and trough and 
maximum concentrations for cetuximib in patients with R/M SCCHN.

Study Design:
This is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group Phase 2 study comparing the efficacy and safety of palbociclib in combination with cetuximab versus cetuximab in HPV-negative, cetuximab-naïve patients with R/M SCCHN after failure of one platinum-containing regimen.  Approximately 120 patients will be randomized 1:1 between the investigational arm (Arm A: palbociclib plus cetuximab) and the comparator arm (Arm B: placebo plus cetuximab).  Crossover between treatment arms will be prohibited.C

Page 13Patients will be stratified by  Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG ) performance 
status (0 vs 1), and b y prior use of immunotherap y(yes vs no) .
Patients r andomized to Arm A (investigational arm) will receive :
Palbociclib , 125 mg, orally  once daily (QD) with food on Day 1to Day 21followed 
by 7days off treatment in a 28- day cy cle; 
in combination with
Cetuximab , 400 mg/m2initial dose as a 120-minute intravenous (IV) infusion 
followed b y 250 mg/m2weekl y infused over 60 minutes.
Patie nts randomized to Arm B (comparator arm) will receive: 
Placebo orall y QD with food on Day 1 to Day 21 followed by  7days off treatment in 
a 28-day cycle; 
in combination with
Cetuximab ,
400mg/m2initial dose as a 120 -minute IV infusion followed by  
250mg/m2weekly  infused over 60 minutes.
Patients will continue to receive their assigned treatment until objective disease progression, 
symptomatic dete rioration, unacceptable toxicity , death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever 
occurs first.  
The importance of timely and complete disease assessments in this study  cannot be 
overstated.  Disease assessments will be performed every  8weeks (7days) from t he date of 
randomization.  Each assessment will be performed as scheduled according to the calendar 
regardless of an y dosing delay  to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of 
efficacy .  Failure to perform any  of the required disease assessme nts will result in the 
inability  to determine disease status for that time point.  Tumor assessments will be 
performed until radiographically  and/or clinicall y (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) 
documented progressive disease ( PD)asper RECIST v.1.1, initiation of new anticancer 
therap y,or discontinuation of patient from overall study  participation (eg, death, patient's 
request, lost to follow- up), whichever occurs first.  Off schedule or incomplete disease 
assessments have the potential to weaken the conclusion of this clinical trial and must be 
avoided wherever possible.
Patients who discontinue study  treatment for reasons other than radiographically  and/or 
clinically  (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECI ST
v.1.1 will continue to have tumor assessment performed duri ng the follow- up visits every  
8weeks (7days) until RECI ST-defined disease progression, initiation of new anticancer 
therap y or discontinuation of patient from overall study  participation (eg, death, patient's 
request, lost to follow
-up), whichever occurs first.

Page 14Patients discontinuing the active treatment phase will enter a follow -up period during which 
survival and new anti -cancer therapy information will be collected every  2months from the 
last dose of investigational product.  The follow -up period will conclude at the time of the
final OS anal ysis.
Efficacy  anal yses will be performed using the local radiologist’s/investigator’s tumor 
assessments as the primary  data source .
Patients will undergo study -related safet y, efficacy, and PK assessm ents as outlined in the
Schedule of 
Activities section.
A key  objective of the biomarker anal yses that will be performed in this study  is to 
investigate candidate biomarkers assessed in tumor tissue an d blood obtained prior to 
treatment for their potential predictive value in identify ing patients who may  benefit from 
treatment with cetuximab in combination with palbociclib or placebo .Blood and tumor 
(optional) biomarkers also assessed on -treatment pro vide an opportunit y to investigate 
pharmacod ynamics effects, and tumor specimen (optional) and blood collected upon disease 
progression (end of treatment) will be anal yzed to investigate potential mechanisms of 
resistance to treatment .
In addition, blood samples will be collected from all patients in Cy cles1 and 2 to assess 
steady -state trough concentrations of palbociclib and pre-and post -infusion concentrations of 
cetuximab to provide an opportunity  to conduct an exploratory  exposure/response anal ysis 
for safety  and efficacy  findings as well as correlative anal yses between drug exposure and 
biomarker changes from baseline.
Examining and measuring the patient’s subjective experience in this study  will be 
accomplished using health- related q uality  of life q uestionnaires. These assessments provide 
the means to validly  and reliably  quantify  subjective information, which is provided by  the 
study  patients in response to specific questions from validated instruments.   Observations
will be documented at specified timepoints throughout the study , plus 1 observation after 
treatment discontinuation (to measure the impact of progressive disease on the patient’s 
quality  of life).
An independent third party  External Data Monitoring Committee (E
-DMC) will monitor the 
theefficacy  and safety  of patients in the study  according to the Charter. The E -DMC will 
make recommendation as to whether or not the trial should continue based on ongoing 
reviews of safet y data.  In addition, the E -DMC will also evaluate interim efficacy  data and 
make a recommendation regarding stud y continuation based on observed results of the study.  
The recommendations made b y the E -DMC to alter the conduct of the study  will be 
forwarded to Pfizer for final decision.

Page 15Statistical Methods:
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate that the combination of palbociclib with 
cetuxi mab is superior to cetuximab in prolonging OSin the target population.  This study  is 
designed to test the null hy pothesis of equal survival between treatment arms ve rsus the 
alternative hypothesis of improved survival in the palbociclib + cetuximab arm compared 
with the placebo + cetuximab arm.
Assuming a medi an OS of 6 months in the comparator arm, approximatel y 79total events
(death s
)are required for1:1randomiza tion to have at least 80% power to detect a true hazard 
ratio of 0.6 (corresponding to a median OS of 10 month in the palbociclib arm) using a 
one-sided, log-rank test at a significance level of 0.1.  One interim anal ysis based on OS is 
planned when at lea st50% of the OS events (40deaths) have been observed .  The purpose of 
this interim analy sis is to 
provide an opportunit y to potentially stop the study  early for
futility .  The study  may  be considered for earl y termination if the hazard ratio estimate is 
greater than 0.9 .  The formal futility  boundary  will be constructed using the Gamma famil y 
of spending function with parameter = 
0.05.  With 40 observed events at the interim anal ysis, 
the futilit y boundary  is p- value = 0.36 (corresponding to HR = 0.9) . The boundary  at final 
analysis is p-vlaue = 0.1.
Approximately  120 patients will be enrolled in about 16 months and followed for about 
6
months to observe the required number of events.  This estimation is based on the 
following assumptions on the enrollmen t rates: 1) 5 patients per month (on average) during 
the first 6 months; 2) 10 patients per mo nth (on average) thereafter .

a.Active Treatment Phase: All assessments should be performed prior to dosing with study medications on the visit day unless otherwise indicated.  
Acceptable time windows for performing each assessment are described in the column headers. For the purposes of this trial, 1 cycl e is 28 days in length. A 
cycle could be longer than 28 days if persistent toxicity delays the initiation of the subsequent cycle.
b.Cycle 1/Day 1: Physical examination/vital signs, blood chemistry, hematology, urinaly sis, coagulation, and 12-lead ECG are not required if accep table 
screening assessment is performed within 7 days prior to randomization.
c.Cycle X, Day 1: In the event that the start of a new cycle is delayed due to treatment related toxicity, procedures required on Day 1 of the giv en cycle will be 
performed when palbociclib/placebo is resumed.  New cycle Day 1 procedures (ie, physical examination, vital signs, ECOG performa nce status, ECG, 
Quality of Life questionnaires, blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, coagulation, and serum pregnancy test) that were perfo rmed prior to knowing the 
need to delay the start of the cycle do not need to be repeated (1) if not required to determine whether study drug may be resu med and (2) if performed 
within 7 days prior to study drug resumption.
d.End of Treatment/Withdrawal: End of Treatment/Withdrawal visit will be performed as soon as possible but no later than 4 weeks (ie, 28 days) 7d a y s  
from last dose of study treatment and prior to the initiation of any new anticancer therapy.
e.Post Treatment Follow-up:   After discontinuation of study treatment, post-treatment follow-up (including survival status and post-study anticancer thera py 
evaluation) will be collected every 2 months ( 7 days) from the last dose of study treatment.  Telephone contact is acceptable.
f.Informed Consent: Informed consent may be obtained greater than 28 days from randomization; however, it must be obtained prior to any protocol 
required assessments being performed.
g.Medical/Oncological History: To include information on prior anticancer treatments.
h.Baseline Signs/Symptoms: Baseline tumor related signs and symptoms will be recorded at the C1D1 visit prior to initiating treatment and then reported as  
AEs during the trial if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.CCI

Page 19i.HPV-status: Patients must be HPV-negative to participate in this study.  Analytical method is per institutional standards.
j.Physical Examination/Vital signs: A full physical examination including an examination of all major body systems (including head, ears, eyes, nose, 
mouth, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, breasts, abdomen, and musculoskeletal), height (at screening only), weight, blood pr essure and pulse rate, which 
may be performed by a physician, registered nurse or other qualified health care provider, will be required at Screening and C2D1 .  If screening assessment 
is not performed within 7 days prior to randomization, a full physical examination must be performed at C1D1. Symptom-directed phys ical examinations, 
blood pressure and pulse rate assessments will be performed at subsequent visits.
k.Serum Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, and assayed in a 
certified laboratory, will be performed on 2 occassions prior to starting study therapy- once at the start of screening, and once at th e baseline visit, 
immediately before investigational product administration.  A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receiv e the investigational 
product.  Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when pot ential pregnancy is 
otherwise suspected), repeated at Day 1 of each cycle, and at the end of the study to confirm the patient has not become pregnant  during the study.  
Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request of institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if require d by local regulations.  In case 
of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the patient will be withdrawn from study medication and from the study.  Two methods of high ly effective contraception 
must be used throughout the study and continue for 6 months after the last dose of cetuximab.  See Section 4.4 for further information.
l.Hematology, and Blood Chemistry Panel, and Urinalysis: Hematology includes hemoglobin, WBC, absolute neutrophils, absolute lymphocytes, and 
platelet count.  Blood chemistry includes AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, total calcium, t otal bilirubin, BUN (or 
urea), serum creatinine, uric acid, phosphorous (or phosphate), albumin, fasted glucose, and hemoglobin A1c.  Additional hematolo gy/chemistries panels 
may be performed as clinically indicated.  Fasting glucose will be acquired at baseline C1D1, C1D15, and C2D1.  For all patient s, including patients starting 
post-study anticancer therapy, 8 weeks after the completion of therapy, blood chemistry panel consisting of magnesium, total calc ium, and potassium must 
be checked.  If abnormalities are observed, an ECG can be performed at the discretion of the investigator to check QTc.  Urinal ysis will be conducted via 
urine dipstick for urine protein: if the result is positive, further diagnostic testing will be performed as clinically indicat ed.
m.Hemoglobin A1c: Hemoglobin A1c will be measured at C1D1, during the active treatment phase every 3 months from the date of randomization (ie, C4D 1, 
C7D1, C10D1, etc.), and at the End of Treatment visit.
n.Coagulation:   Coagulation analysis includes PT or INR and PTT/aPTT.
o.12-Lead ECG : All ECGs should be obtained after a fast of at lease 1 hour.  For the purpose of this study, triplicate ECGs are defined as t hree consecutive 
ECGs performed approximately 2 minutes apart but within 10 minutes for all 3 ECGs at the protocol-specified timpoints to determi ne the mean QTc 
interval.

Page 20r.Archival Tumor Tissue Specimen : All patients will provide a FFPE archival tumor specimen, specifically a FFPE tissue block that contain sufficient tissue 
to generate at least 15 unstained slides, each with tissue sections that are 5 microns thick, or at least 15 unbaked glass slides,  each containing an unstained 
5 micron FFPE tissue section if FFPE tissue block cannot be submitted.  If an archival tumor tissue sample is not available, a d e novo tumor biopsy 
specimen must be obtained.  Specimens will be sent to the Sponsor-designated central laboratory.  Details for the handling of t hese specimens, including 
processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Study Manual.
s.De Novo Tumor Specimens : Optional de novo tumor biopsy collection at screening, C1D15 or C2D15 (pre-dose, one time point only) and at the time of 
progression/End of Treatment is strongly encouraged; no more than 3 timepoints should be collected in total.  In all cases, these s pecimens will be provided 
in addition to the archival tumor tissue specimen that is required for enrollment.  Details for handling of these specimens inc luding processing, storage, and 
shipment will be provided in the Study Manual. 
 
 
 
v.Disease Assessments: Please refer to the Tumor Assessment Requirements Flowchart for details and timing of procedures.
w.Drug Compliance: Palbociclib and placebo bottle(s), including any unused capsules, will be returned to the clinic for drug accountability.  Drug 
accountability will be performed on Day 1 of every cycle prior to dispensing drug supply for the next cycle.
x.AEs: For SAEs, the active reporting period begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent through and including 28 c alendar days after the 
last administration of the investigational product.  Following the active safety reporting period, other SAEs of which the inve stigator becomes aware should 
be reported to Pfizer, unless the SAE is attributed by the investigator to complications of either the underlying malignancy or  any subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy or to the patient’s participation in a subsequent clinical study.  AEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the 
patient has taken at least one dose of study treatment through last patient visit.
y.Concomitant Medications/Treatments: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and up 
to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. If a patient begins new therapy before the 28-day time period is complete, conc omitant medication 
information will not be recorded (from the start date of the new therapy). This includes H1 antagonists pre-medication to allevi ate cetuximab infusion 
reactions.
z.EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-H&N35 Assessments: Patients will complete questionnaires prior to any study or medical procedure on Day 1 of 
Cycles 1, 2 and 3 and then Day 1 of every other cycle thereafter starting with Cycle 5 (ie, Cycle 5, 7, 9, etc.), and at the End of Tr eatment visit. Four weeks 
after discontinuation of study treatment due to progressive disease, patients, including patients starting post-study anticancer  therapy, will be completing the 
questionnaires at the Follow-up Visit.  All self-assessment questionnaires must be completed by the patients while in the clini c and cannot be taken home.  
Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances, but family members are not permitted to assist wi th questionnaire 
administration.C

a.Screening scans must occur within 4 w eeks (ie, 28 days) prior to randomization unless otherw ise specified. 
b.Tumor assessment must be done during the treatment period, every 8 weeks (7days) until radiographically and/or clinically (ie, for photographed or 
palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECIST v.1.1, initiation of ne w anticancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation 
(eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow up), whiche ver occurs first.  The schedule of assessments should be fixed according to the calendar, regardless 
of treatment delays/interruptions.  Imaging assessments are to be scheduled using the randomization date as the reference dat e for all time -points and are 
NOT to be scheduled based on the date of the previous imaging time -point.  Imaging assessment delay to conform to treatment delay is not permitted .  The 
same tumor assessment technique MUST be used throughout the study for a given lesion/patient. 
c.Patients who have already demonstrated objective disease progression as per RECIST v.1.1 do not need to have scans repeated at the end of treatment visit 
or during the post -treatment follow -up.  For patients who do not have documented objective disease progression at time of study treatment discontinuation, 
tumor assessment will continue to be performed every 8 weeks (7days) until radiographically and/or clinically confirmed objective disease progression, 
initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation o f patient from overall study participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow -up). 
d.The CT scans, including brain CT scan if applicable, should be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medi cal reasons.  If IV contrast is 
medi cally contraindicated, the imaging modality to be used to follow  the disease (either CT w ithout contrast or MRI) should be th e modality which best 
evaluates the disease, and the choice should be determined by the investigator in conjunction with the local radiologist.  MRI of the abdomen can be 
substituted for CT if MRI adequately depicts the disease.  How ever, MRI of the chest should not be substituted for CT of ches t even if IV contrast is 
contraindicated.  In such case CT will be performed without contra st.  If MRI is used to follow -up bone lesion(s) it must be performed a few days before 
any treatment that may affect bone- marrow  cellularity (eg, G -CSF). 
e.Radiographic assessments obtained per the patient’s standard of care prior to randomization into the study do not need to be repeated and are acceptable to 
use as baseline evaluations, if (1) obtained w ithin 28 days before randomization, (2) they were performed using the method requirements outlined in 
RECIST v.1.1 (3) the same technique/modality can be u sed to follow  identified lesions throughout the trial for a given patient, and (4) appropriate 
documentation indicating that these radiographic tumor assessments were performed as standard of care is available in the pat ient’s source notes. 
f.Baseline brain scans are required in patients with a history of metastatic brain disease.  Brain scans performed before the signing of infor med consent as 
routine procedures (but within 6 weeks before randomization) do not need to be repeated and may be used as baseline assessments as long as (1) tests were 
performed using the method requirements outlined in RECIST v.1.1 (2) the same technique/modality can be used to follow  identi fied lesions throughout 
the trial for a given patient (3) appropriate documentation indicati ng that these radiographic tumor assessments were performed as standard of care is 
available in the patient’s source notes.  Post -baseline repeat brain scans will be required only if new metastases are suspected.

Page 22g.Clinical assessment of superficial disease must be carried out on the same date as the imaging studies and will include photographs of all superficial 
metastatic lesions.  All lesion measurements must be recorded in the CRF.
Notes: 
- Radiographic tumor assessments may be done at any time if there is clinical suspicion of disease progression at the discretion of the investigator.  If progressive disease is 
confirmed per RECIST v.1.1, patients are expected to discontinue study therapy and begin the follow -up phase of the trial

Page 291.INTRODUCTION
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is the sixth most common cancer.  
Globally , approximatel y 600,000 new cases occur y early. In the United States, it is estimat ed 
that about 55,00 0new cases of oral cavity , phary ngeal, and lary ngeal cancers will occur in 
2014, which account for about 3% of new cancer cases. Data from a non- age-specific 
meta -analysis of 17,346 patients from 93 randomized trials presented orophary ngeal cancer 
as the most frequentl y observed (36%) SCCHN tumor ty pe, followed by  laryngeal and oral 
cavity  cancer s(21% each ).1
An estimated 12,000 deaths from SCCHN will occur during 2014 in the United States (US) .2
In the European Union ( EU)an estimated 21,000 deaths from oral and h ypophary ngeal 
cancers occurred each year between 2005 and 2009 .3
Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 90% of the head andneck tumors and the main risk 
factors include tobacco use, and alcohol use .4  Even though SCCHN is considered a 
predominantly  male disease, several studies have reported a higher women proportion in the 
elderl y SCCHN populatio
n, with a sex ratio close to 1. Tobacco and alcohol consumption 
were the major risk factors identified in 50% of the male population, whereas chronic oral 
trauma, leukoplakia and lichen planus were the predominant risk factors found in half of the 
female population.6  The oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a risk factor 
for orophary ngeal SCCHN .5P
atients with HPV infection tend to be younger than 
HPV -unrelated SCCHN patients.  HPV seems to have minor effect in the pathogenesis of 
SCCHN in the elderly  population .  Advanced age itself is considered to be a risk factor for 
poor outcome. 
Local treatment of SCCHN often incorporates multimodality  therapy  and can be associated 
with signific ant 
functional sequelae .  Multimodality  treatment including surgery and/or , 
radiation and/or chemotherap y is considered the best therapeutic options for patients with 
SCCHN .  Unfortunately, development of recurrent or even metastatic disease after therap y is 
common , and occurs in 40
-60% of patients with locally  advanced disease despite initially  
aggressive multimodal therap y. R/M disease is associated with poor outcomes and a median 
overall survival (OS) of 10 -11months in the first -line treatment setting, and about 6 months 
in the second -linetreatment setting .  Chemoradiotherapy regimens have reached th eir upper 
limit of tolerability  so that the investigation of new rational targets, based on the biology  of 
the disease, is of major importance, thus highli ghting the current need for more efficacious 
and better tolerated therapy .7
1.1.
Mechanism of Action/ Indication
Palbociclib is a highly  selective, reversible oral inhibitor of cy clin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 
(CDK 4/ 6). The compound prevents cellular deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) sy nthesis by  
prohibiting progression of the cell cy cle from G1 into S phase.  Palbociclib is being 
develope d in combination with cetuximab (Erbitux), an epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR ) antagonist, for the treatment of HPV- negative, cetuximab -naïve, R/M SCCHN after
failure of one platinum -based chemo therapy regimen .

Page 301.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Role of EGFR in SCCHN
Epidermal growth factor rec eptor (EGFR ) overexpression is found in approxim ately  90% of 
SCCHN cases8and it is associated with decreased progression
-free survival (P FS) and OS .9
The ErbB famil y of proteins contain four receptor tyrosine kinases, structurally related to 
EGFR, includes HER1 (EGFR, ErbB1), HER2 (EGFR, ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3), and HER4 
(ErbB4). EGFR -directed drugs include antibodies that prevent ligand -binding and /or 
receptor dimerization (eg, cetuximab) and small molecule adenosine
triphosphate- competitive inhibitors of the intrinsic catal yticactivit y of ErbB receptors 
(eg,erlotinib and gefitinib ). 
1.2.2. Deregulation of Cell Cycle Related Genes and Proteins in SCCHN
Important regulatory proteins involved in the cell cycle transition from G1 to the S -Phase are 
cyclin D1 (CCND1 ), p16INK4 A(thereafter referred to as p16) and CDK4. Deregulation of 
aspects of the cell -cycle, including CDKs, have been shown to contribute to the development 
of cancer.10,11
CCND1 , encoded b y cyclin D1 is a well characterized member of the cy clin D family  and is 
a positive regulator of the cell cy cle (in complex with CDK4, see below) and is amplified in 
80% or more cases of HPV -negative SCCHN.12Cyclin D1 has been recognized a s amarker 
of poor prognosis .13,14,15,16,17,18With platinums as important component of first line therap y 
of SCCHN it is noteworthy  that Cyclin D1 overexpression in SCCHN was associated with 
cisplatin resist ance in vitro, in vivo,19,20and clinically.21
CDK4 and CDK6 are two closely  related kinases that are regulated b y the cyclin D famil y 
members.22In preclinical studie s, increased levels of cy clin D and decreased levels of p16
(see below) , have been associated with increased sensitiv ity to CDK 4 and 6 inhibition.23  
Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of cy clin D -dependent kinase act ivity may  prevent 
tumor growth.22
CDKN2A , which encodes p16, is considered a negative regulator of the cell cy cle.  It is
inactivated in most cases of HPV- negative SCCHN by  mutation, methy lation in combination 
with chromosome l oss or by  homozy gous deletion.24Over -expression of cyclin D1 ,along 
with decreased expression of p16 and abrogation of p53 function ,can cause cellular 
immortal ization of oral keratinocy tes.25Thus, cy clin D1 over expression in the context of 
decreased expression of p16 is likely  to be an important driver of HPV- negative SCCHN . 
1.2.3. Interaction of EGFR and CDK4/6 in SCCHN
CCND1 is one of the many  genes induced b y intranuclear EGFR, linking cell cycle 
progression to EGFR stimulation.26  Data from SCCHN cell lines suggest an association 
between resistance to EGFR inhibitors and cy clin D1 ampli fication and/or overexpression.27

Page 311.2.4. Investigational Agents : Cetuximab
Cetuximab (Erbitux)is a chimeric monoclon al antibody  directed against EGFR .In the US, 
EU, and Japan, c etuximab is approved in combination with radiation therapy  forthe 
treatment of locall y advanced SCCHN and in combination with platinum- based
chemotherap y for the treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN.  In the US it is also 
approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN
for whom prior platinum -based chemo therap y has failed.
In a randomize d Phase 3 trial conducted on 424 patients with locoregi onally advanced 
(stage III or IV) SCCHN in which patients received either radiotherap y alone or radiation 
plus weekl y cetuximab, cetuximab combined with radiotherap
y improved median survival 
from 29.3 to 49.0 months (p- value = 0.03) and locoregional control from 14.9 to 24.4 months 
(p-value =0.05).28,29
In randomized, open -label, multinationa l, Phase 3clinical trials, cetuximab plus first- line 
platinum -based chemotherap ysignifi cantl y improved OS (primary  endpoint) compared with 
first-lineplatinum -based chemotherap yin patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN .7
This study  demonstrated a signi ficant benefit of cetuximab with an improvement in median 
OS from 7.4 months to 10.1 months (p
-value = 0.04).
Three Phase 2 trials have investigated the role of cetuximab in patients with advanced 
SCCHN who had progressed on platinum- based chemotherap y.  In such trials, cetuximab 
administered a s a single -agent in the second -line setting, was associated with response rates
between 10 and 1 3%, a median PFS of about 3 month s, and a median OS of 6months.30,31,32
Vermorken and colleagues conducted a pooled analy sis of these trials.33The anal ysis 
compared the outcome of these patients t o that of pat ients who received a range of common 
second -line treatment approaches including best supportive care, palliative chemotherap y, 
radiotherap yand chemoradiotherapy in a retrospective study . The median OS for patients in 
theretrospective study  was 3.4 month s.
Cetuximab -related adverse events ( AEs), which include skin rash, hy pomagnesaemia and
infusion- related reactions, are mostly  mild to moderate in severit y and manageable . The 
most serious AEs associated with cetuximab are infusion reactions, cardiopulmonary  arrest, 
dermatologic toxicity  and radiation dermatitis, sepsis, renal failure, interstitial lung disease, 
and pulmonary  embolus. The current boxed warning includes infusion reactions and 
cardiopulmonary  arrest .
1.2.5. Investigational Agents: Palbociclib
1.2.5.1. Pre-Clinical Data
1.2.5.1.1. Evidence of P albociclib Single Agent A ctivity in SCCHN Tumor M odels
Palbociclib (Molecular Weight: 447.53) is a highly selective inhibitor of CDK 4/cyclinD 1
kinase activity (IC50=11nM; K i=2nM).   Palbociclib has selectivity for CDK 4/6, wit h little 
or no activity against a large panel of 274 other protein kinases including other Cdks and a 
wide variet yof tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases.
  CDK 6, another enzyme that also 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 32complexes with cyclin-Dsubunits, is also commonly expressed in mam malian cells and 
tumors. CDK 6 is highly  homologous to CDK 4 and can perform the same function by
phosphory lating Rb, thus potentially creating a redundant mechanism to promote cell cycle
progression. Consequently ,inhibition of both enzy mesis necessary to ensure complete 
suppression of Rb phosphory lation and the greatest possible spectrum of antitumor activit y.  
Results indicate that palbociclib inhibits CDK 6 with equivalent potency to CDK 4. 
Palbociclib showed anti -proliferative effects on Rb - positive ce lls in vitro and inhibition of 
tumor growth in several Rb- positive huma n breast and colon xenografts. In these models, 
palbociclib resulted in decreased Rb phosphory lation and decreased Ki -67 expression, but 
did not show activity  in Rb-negative tumor xeno grafts.22  Additional information may  be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)for palbociclib. 
To assess the significance of CDK4/6 signaling in SCCHN, a breadth of efficacy  studies 
were conducted across a panel of molecu larly annotated cell lines and tumor explants.  In 
SCCHN cell line s p
albociclib treatment produced growth arrest in the majority of models 
tested. Palbociclib treated cells showed reduced phosphory lation of Rb, inhibition of E2F 
signaling, and loss of CDK 4/6 substrate FOXM1. Treated cell lines display edinhibition of 
new DNA s ynthesis, measured through incorporation of EdU, andshowed no signs of 
apoptosis when assessed through measurement of active c aspases. To evaluate the efficacy  
of palbociclib in SC CHN models in vivo, tumor growth inhibition studies were run in a panel 
of three patient -
derived xenografts.  Single agent p albociclib displayed equivalent or superior 
efficacy  to single agent c etuximab treatment in these s tudies, with demonstration of 
>90% inhibition in one model and partial inhibition (>60% TGI) in one model (unpublished 
data, data on file at Pfizer).
1.2.5.1.2.
Evidence for Additive/Synergistic Activity for the C ombination of Palbociclib
and C etuximab
Combinatorial efficacy  was observed following treatment with palbociclib and inhibitors of 
the EGFR pathway , including cetuximab, in preclinical models.  In a panel of 24 SCCHN 
cell lines the p albociclib combination with c etuximab produced s ynergistic growth inhibition 
in 50% of models. The combinatio n ofpalbociclib and c etuximab in a subset of these cell 
lines demonstrated increased inhibition of pRb and downstream E2F signaling, leading to 
greater inhibition of new DNA s ynthesis and increased hallmarks of cellular senescence than 
with each agent alo ne. In vivo studies in patient
-derived xenografts demonstrated the ability  
of either single agent to produce >90% tumor growth inhibition in distinct models, and in a 
model that failed to show significant response to either si ngle agent, the combination o f 
palbociclib and c etuximab y ielded s ynergistic tumor growth inhibition . 
1.2.5.1.3. Overview of Nonclinical Safety Data
The nonclinical safet y profile of palbociclib has been well characterized through the conduct 
of single -and repeat -dose toxicity  studies up to 39 weeks in duration, and safet y 
pharmacolog y, genetic toxicity , reproductive and developmental toxicity , and phototoxicity  
studies. 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 33Consistent with the pharmacologic activity of palbociclib (cell cycle inhibition, 
CDK4/6 inhibition), the primary  target organ findings included hematoly mphopoietic 
(decreased cellularit y of bone marrow and l ymphoid organs) and male reproductive organ 
(seminiferous tubule degeneration, and secondary  effects on the epididy mis, prostate, and 
seminal vesicle) effects in rats and d ogs, and altered glucose metabolism that was 
accompanied b y effects on the pancreas and secondary changes in the eye, teeth, kidney, and 
adipose tissue in rats only, and effects on bone in rats only  that were observed following 
single and/or repeat dosing at clinically  relevant exposures.  Altered glucose metabolism 
(hypergl ycemia/glucosuria) correlated with pancreatic islet cell vacuolation that was 
determined to reflect a loss of beta cells with corresponding decreases in insulin and 
C
-peptide.  The rever sibility  of the effects on glucose homeostasis, pancreas, ey e, kidney , 
and bone was not established following a 12 -week non -dosing period; whereas partial to full 
reversal of effects on thehemato- lymphopoietic and male reproductive systems , teeth, and 
adipose tissue were observed.
Additionally , a potential for QTc prolongation and hemody namic effects were identified 
from safet y pharmacology studies, and developmental toxicity  was identified from 
embry o-fetal development studies in the rat and rabbit.
Though gastrointestinal effects would be anticipated from a cell cy cle inhibitor and while 
effects were observed in rats and dogs following single -and repeat -dose studies up to 
3 weeks in duration (emesis, fecal changes, and microscopic changes in stomach and
intestines), the effects were of limited severit y at clinically relevant doses .  Gastrointestinal 
effects were not prominent in longer duration studies, limited to effects on the glandular 
stomach and rodent -specific effects on the non -glandular stomach i n rats following 27 weeks 
of intermittent dosing that did not reverse during a 12 -week non -dosing period .  Additional
palbociclib -related findings 
considered non- adverse at tolerated doses based on limited 
severit y and/or absence of degenerative changes included cellular vacuolation in multiple 
tissues that was morphologically consistent with phospholipidosis ; hepatic (increases in liver 
enzy mes, hepatocellular hy pertrophy /increased vacuolation), renal (increased chronic 
progressive neuropath y), adrenal (co rtical cell hy pertrophy ), and respiratory  (clinical signs, 
tracheal epithelial cell atrophy )effects; and prolonged coagulation times.  Reversibility  
(partial or full) was established for these additional toxicities.  Finally , palbociclib was 
determined to be an aneugen, for which a no effect exposure was identified.  Additional 
information may
 be foun d in the I Bfor palbociclib.
1.2.5.2. Clinical Data
Two Phase 1 trials evaluated single agent administration of palbociclib to patients with 
Rb-positive cancers.34,35One of these trials determined that the dose- limiting toxicity  (DLT) 
was neutropenia and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 125 mg once daily  when 
administered for 21 of 28 days (3/1 schedule). The most comm on non- hematologic AE s 
included fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.  The mean half -life of 
palbociclib was 26.9 hours.  
Patients were selected for Rb -positive cancers, based on immunohistochemistry  (IHC)stain, 
defin ed as positive if staining intensity  was 1+ or greater above background.  Stable disease 
for 4cycles (16 weeks) occurred in 27% of evaluable patients and in a number of tumor 
types (liposarcoma, testicular, renal, ovarian, breast, appendiceal, peritoneal , melanoma, 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 34thymoma and lung ).  Another P hase I trial of palbociclib using an alternative dosing plan 
(21day
 cycles; 2/1 schedule) observed a similar likelihood of disease contro l in a variet y of 
tumor ty pes.34These studies demonstrate that palbociclib has substantial activity  in 
Rb-positive tumors. 
A randomized P hase 2trial initiated to determine the overall s afety and efficacy of 
palbociclib (125 mg) and letrozole (2.5mg) versus letrozole in post -menopaus al women with 
ER+ HER2- negative advanced breast cancer.36  The overall objective response rate (ORR)
was 45% for those women who received palbociclib plus letrozole versus 31% for those who 
received letrozole (statistically  significant ).  Importantly , the me dian PFS was significantly  
different (26.2 versus 7.5 months) favoring the combination arm.
The most common adverse drug reactions of an y grade reported in patients in the palbociclib
plus letrozole arm were neutropenia, leuk openia, fatigue, anemia, upper respiratory  infection, 
nausea, stomatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, thrombocy topenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, 
asthenia, peripheral neuropathy, and epistaxis . The most frequentl y reported serious adverse 
drug reaction in pat ients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole was diarrhea (2.4%).
Overall, neutropenia of any  grade was reported in 62 (74.7%) patients in the combination 
arm, with Grade 3 neutropenia being reported in 40 (48.2%) patients, and Grade 4 
neutropenia being repo rted in 5 (6.0%) patients.
In the combination arm, 56.6% of patients had a maximum grade of Grade 3 neutropenia and 
4.8% of patients had a maximum grade of Grade 4 neutropenia based on laboratory  data. 
The median time to first episode of neutropenia was 1 5days for any  grade, Grade 2, and 
Grade 4 neutropenia, and 28 days for Grade 3 neutropenia in the palbociclib plus letrozole 
arm.Median duration of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 7 days.Most episodes of Grade 3 
neutropenia were managed by  dose reductio n and/or dose delay  or temporary  discontinuation 
and did not require permanent discontinuation of study  treatment or addition of supportive 
therap y
.
Palbociclib, in combination with anti -hormonal treatment, is currently  being tested in large 
Phase 3 studie s, in patients with advanced ER+ HER2- negative breast cancer.
Palbociclib has also demonstrated activity in a broad range of other solid tumors and 
hematological malignancies.  I n relapsed mantle cell ly mphoma selected for cy clin D1 
overexpression,37the objective response ( complete response [ CR] or partial response [ PR]) 
rate was 18% and the stable disease (SD) rate was 41%.  Significant reductions in 
phospho- Rb (89%) and Ki -67 (74%) occurred in paired biops y samples after trea tment with 
palbociclib . 
In a study  in 29 patients with well-differentiated and dedif ferentiated liposarcoma,
Dickson et al reported a 66% (90% CI, 51% to 100%) PFS rate at 12 weeks. Themedian 
PFS was 18 weeks, and there was one partial response. Grade 3 to 4 events included anemia, 
thrombocy topenia, neutropenia , and febrile neutropenia in one patient .38

Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 35In an ongoing P hase 1 clinical trial of escalating doses of palbociclib added to fi xed dose 
cetuximab in patients with SCCH N, one partial tumor response was observed in a patient 
with SCC
HNresistant to cetuximab and cisp latin. Disease control (PR or SD ) occurred in 
6of the 7 evaluable patients. Of the 6 patients with cetuximab -resistant SCCHN , 
5experienced di sease control with combined palbociclib +cetuximab treatment. Of the 
4patients with cisplatin- resistant SCCHN , 3experienced disease control with palbociclib + 
cetuximab. These clinical data support significant potential efficacy  of palbociclib in 
SCCHN ( Appendix 1).  Further data anal yses, including PK, safety , and efficacy  anal ysis, are 
in progress for this study .Additional information may  be foun
d in the IB for palbociclib.
1.2.6. Dose Rationale for the Combination
In the afore mentioned on going Phase 1 dose escalation study , palbociclib was administered
at doses of 100 and 125 mg QD for 21 out of 28 days (3/1 schedule) .  Cetuximab was 
administered at the initial dose of 400 mg/m2as a 120
-minute IV infusion, followed b y 
250mg/m2weekly  dose, infused over 60 minutes. The combination was well tolerated 
without any DLTs observed at either dose level. U ncomplicated neutropenia wasthe most 
frequent AE. Based on this study , the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined to 
be 125mg of pa lbociclib administered o n the 3/1 schedule in combination with the standard 
dose for cetuximab .
Comple te information for palbociclib may be found in the Single Reference Safet y 
Document (SRSD) , which for this stud y is the IB .  The SRSD for the active comp arator 
agent, cetuximab (Erbitux), is the most recent version of the Summary  of Product 
Characteristics ( SPC).39
1.2.7. Study Rationale
HPV -negative, R/M, SCCHN represents a disease with a dismal prognosis.  Although t he 
EGFR inhibit or cetuximab is an important recent addition to the treatment options for the 
second -
line treatment of SCCHN , ithas resulted in only modest improvements in clinical 
outcomes, and no standard of care exists.  Therefore, n ewer treatments or treatment regime ns 
with novel mechanisms of action are desperatel y needed. 
Over expression of cy clin D1 and inactivation of p16 occur in the vast ma jority  of cases of 
HPV -negative SCCHN , but not in HPV -related SCCHN, in which both loss of Rb and high 
p16 expression levels are common .  Genomic characterization of oral HPV -negative SCCHN 
identified amplification of CCND1 (cyclin D1) and/or loss of CDKN2A (p16) in 94% of 
tumors, supporting that ce ll cycle alterations are a nearl y universal feature in this patient 
population ,32and that a drug targeting cell cy cle such as palbociclib may  be appropriate to 
test in this disease setting.
A breadth of preclinical in vitro and in vivo efficacy  studies were conducted in which 
palbociclib display ed equivalent or superior efficacy  to single agent cetuximab treatment and 
combination treatment with the two agents increased efficacy and/or the DR .

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 36Based on the evidence presented, the proposed Phase 2 study  provides the opportunity  to test
the hy pothesis that the addition of palbociclib to cetuximab will improve outcomes in 
patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN after failue of one platinum
-containing regimen .
1.2.8. Summary of Benefit Risk Assessment
Current second -line treatments for HPV- negativ e, R/M, SCCHN have minimal effectiveness 
and are undesirabl y toxic.  The result is OS in this setting is very  short; therefore, there is a 
high unmet medical need for new and improved treatment options.
The potential benefits of the present stud y are base d on sound pre clinical and preliminary  
clinical evidence that inhibition of the cy clin D1/CDK4 axis by palbociclib in combination 
with EGFR inhibition by  cetuximab can be 
an effective treatment for patients with incurable, 
cetuximab -naïve, HPV -negative SCC HN. It can be expected that patients will benefit from 
prolonged sur vival, PFS , and other health -related outcomes, such as delay ed deterioration or 
improvement of global health status, pain and swallowing capabilities. 
Potential risks associated with palbociclib include non -cumulative, reversible, uncomplicated 
neutropenia (about 50% Grade 3) managed by  dose reduction and/or dose delay  or tempor ary 
discontinuation without the require ment of permanent discontinuation of treatment or 
addition of supportive therap y. Other risks associated include leukopenia, fatigue, anemia, 
upper respiratory  infection, nausea, stomatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, thrombocy topenia, 
decreased appetite, vomiting, asthenia, peripheral neuropath y, and epistaxis . 
Risks 
associate d with cetuximab include infusion reactions, der matologic tox icity, cardiac arrest,
andhypomagnesemia . The overall toxicit y profiles of palbociclib and cetuximab do not 
overlap.
Therefore, the potential benefit s outweigh the potential risks, supporting an ove rall favorable 
benefit/risk assessment in the treatment of patients with incurable, cetuximab -naïve, 
HPV -negative R/M SCCHN after failure of one platinum -containing regimen .

3. STUDY DESIGN
This is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group Phase 2 study comparing the efficacy and safety of palbociclib in combination with cetuximab versus cetuximab in HPV-negative, cetuximab-naïve patients with R/M SCCHN after failure of one platinum-containing regimen.  Approximately 120 patients will be randomized 1:1 between the investigational arm (Arm A: palbociclib plus cetuximab) and the comparator arm (Arm B: placebo plus cetuximab).  Crossover between treatment arms will be prohibited.
Patients will be stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG, see Appendix 5 ) 
performance status (0 vs 1), and by prior use of immunotherapy (yes vs no).
Patients randomized to Arm A (investigational arm) will receive:
Palbociclib, 125 mg, orally once daily (QD) with food on Day 1 to Day 21 followed 
by 7 days off treatment in a 28-day cycle; 
in combination with
Cetuximab, 400 mg/m2initial dose as a 120-minute intravenous (IV) infusion 
followed by 250 mg/m2weekly infused over 60 minutes.
Patients randomized to Arm B (comparator arm) will receive: 
Placebo orally QD with food on Day 1 to Day 21 followed by 7 days off treatment in 
a 28-day cycle; 
in combination with
Cetuximab, 400 mg/m2initial dose as a 120-minute IV infusion followed by 
250 mg/m2weekly infused over 60 minutes.
Patients will continue to receive their assigned treatment until objective disease progression, 
symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. CCI

Page 39The importance of timely and complete disease assessments in this study  cannot be 
overstated.  Disease assessments will be performed every  8weeks (7days) from the date of 
randomization.  Each assessment will be performed as scheduled according to the calendar 
regardless of an y dosing delay  to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of 
efficacy .  Failure to perform any  of the required disease assessments will result in the 
inability  to determine disease status for that ti me point.  Tumor assessments will be 
performed until radiographically  and/or clinicall y (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) 
documented PD as per RECI ST v.1.1, initiation of new anticancer therap y, or discontinuation 
of patient from overall study  participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow -up), 
whichever occurs first.  Off schedule or incomplete disease assessments have the potential to 
weaken the conclusion of this clinical trial and must be avoided wherever possible .
Patients who dis continue study  treatment for reasons other than radiographically  and/or 
clinically  (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECI ST
v.1.1 will continue to have tumor assessment performed duri ng the follow- up visits every  
8weeks (7 days) until RECI ST-defined disease progression, initiation of new anticancer 
therap y or discontinuation of patient from overall study  participation (eg, death, patient's 
request, lost to follow- up), whichever occurs first. 
Patients discontinuing the active treatment phase will enter a follow- up period during which 
survival and new anti -cancer therapy information will be collected every  2months from the 
last dose of investigational product.  The follow -up period will conclude at the time of the 
final OS ana lysis.  Crossover will not be allowed in the trial.
Efficacy  anal yses will be performed using the local radiologist’s/investigator’s tumor 
assessments as the primary  data source .
Patients will undergo study -related safet y, efficacy, and PK assessm ents as o utlined in the
Schedule of 
Activities section.
A key  objective of the biomarker anal yses that will be performed in this study  is to 
investigate candidate biomarkers assessed in tumor tissue and blood obtained prior to 
treatment for their potential predictive value in identify ing patients who may  benefit from 
treatment with cetuximab in combination with palbociclib or placebo .  Blood and tumor 
(optional) biomarkers also assessed on -treatment provide an opportunit y to investigate 
pharmacod ynamics effects, and tumor specimen (optional) and blood collected upon disease 
progression (end of treatment) will be anal yzed to investigate potential mechanisms of 
resistance to treatment.
In addition, blood samples will be collected from all patients in Cy cles1 and 2 to assess 
steady -state trough concentrations of palbociclib and pre-and post -infusion concentrations of 
cetuximab to provide an opportunity  to conduct an exploratory  exposure/response anal ysis 
for safety  and efficacy  findings as well as correl ative anal yses between drug exposure and 
biomarker changes from baseline.

Page 40Examining and measuring the patient’s subjective experience in this study  will be 
accomplished using health- related quality  of life questionnaires. These assessments provide 
the mea ns to validly  and reliably  quantify  subjective information, which is provided by  the 
study  patients in response to specific questions from validated instruments.  Observations 
will be documented at specified timepoints throughout the study , plus 1 observat ion after 
treatment discontinuation (to measure the impact of progressive disease on the patient’s 
quality  of life).
An independent third party  E
-DMC will monitor the the efficacy  and safet y of patients in the 
study  according to the Charter. The E -DMC wil l make recommendation as to whether or not 
the trial should continue based on ongoing reviews of safet y data.  In addition, the E -DMC 
will also evaluate interim efficacy data and make a recommendation regarding study  
continuation based on observed results of the study.  The recommendations made b y the 
E-DMC to alter the conduct of the study  will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision .

Page 444.3. Randomization Criteria
Patients will be randomized into the study  provided they  have satisfied all patient selection 
criteria. 
The investigators or their pre -specified designee will randomize eligible patients by  
interactive randomization technology  (IRT) as described in the Study  Reference Manual. 
At the time of randomization, information about patient demograph ics and stratification 
factors ( ie, ECOG PS [ 0 vs 1 ] and prior use of immunotherap y[yes vs no]) will b e requested. 
The central computerized sy stem will provide the randomization number and treatment 
assignment .
4.4.Lifestyle Guidelines
In this stud y,all male and female
patients of childbearing potential ,as defined in I nclusion 
Criterion 8, must agree to use 2 methods of highly  effective contraception throughout the 
study  and continue for 6 months after the last dose of cetuximab .  The investigator or his/her 
designee , in consultation with the patient, will confirm the patient has selected 2appropriate 
methods of contracept
ion for the individual patient (and his female partner as warranted)
from the list of permitted contraception methods (see below) and confirm that the patient has 
been instructed in their consistent and correct use.  Patients need to affirm that they  meet at 
least 2 of the selected methods of contraception.  The investigator or his/her design ee will 
discuss with the patient the need to use highl y effective contraception consistently  and 
correctly  according to the Schedule of Activities and document such conversation in the 
patient ’s chart.   In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient to 
call immediately  if a selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnanc y is known 
or suspected. 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie,perfect use) and 
include:
1.Established use of oral, inserted, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of 
contraception are allo wed provided the patient plans to remain on the same treatment 
throughout the entire study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an 
adequate period of time to ensure effect iveness .
2.Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD ).
3.Male condom or female con dom used WI TH a spermicide ( ie,foam, gel, film, cream, 
or suppository ).For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus 
spermicide is not accep ted as highly  effective contraception, this option is not 
appropriate.
4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate .

drug through semen to their partners b y using a condom consistently and correctl y, beginning 
with th e first dose of investigational product and continuing for 6months after the last dose
of cetuximab .
4.5.Sponsor ’sQualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study is documented in t hestudy  contact list, located in the coordinator’s manual.
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medica l 
questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, 
at a minimu m, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study  number s, 
contact information for the investigational site, and contact details for a help desk in the 
event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a med ical 
question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the 
patient ’s participation in the study . The help desk number can also be used by  investigational 
staff if they  are seeking advice on medical questions or problems ; however, it should only  be 
used in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational 
site and the study  team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace ,
the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and the study  team 
for advice on medical questions or problems that may  arise during the study . The help desk 
number is not intended for use b y the patient directly ,and if a patient calls that number , he or 
shewill be dir ected back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
If the patient is found t
o be eligible for the study , he/she should be randomized using a 
centralized internet/telephone registration s ystem no more than 4 calendar daysbefor e 
administration of the first dose of investigational product. 
Allocation of patients to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an I nteractive 
Reponse Technolog y (IRT) sy stem (Interactive Web Response (IWR)/Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR) S ystem).  The site personnel (study  coordinator or specified designee) will 
be required to enter or select information including, but not limited to, the user’s 
identification (ID) and password, protocol number, the patient number and date of birth of 
the patient.  The site personnel will then be prov ided with a randomization number and 
dispensable unit (DU) or container number when drug is being supplied via the I RT.  The 
IRT s ystem will provide a confirmation report containing the patient number and DU or 
container number assigned.  The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files.

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 46There is a 24 hour a day , 365 days a year IRT helpdesk available for an y questions or issues.  
The study  specific IRT reference manual will provide the contact information and further 
details on the use of the IRT.
Note: The IRT is the source of the patient number.  The I RT sy stem will provide the patient 
number at the end of the first I RT patient transaction.
Eligible patients will be randomly  assigned in a 1:1 ratio to eit her Arm A (investigational
arm: palbociclib plus cetuximab ) or Arm B (comparator arm: placebo plus cetuximab ) 
stratified according to ECOG PS and prior use of immunothrapy (seeSection 4.3).
Clinical sites must complete t
he screening CRFs for all registered and randomized patients, 
even if the patient is not subsequently  treated in this study . 
At the time of registration, the clinical site staff must provide site and patient identifiers and 
demographic information.  The IRT will assign a unique patient identification number.  The 
IRT s ystem will also be used to assign study medication.
If a patient does not receive the correct stud y treatment for their allocated treatment arm, the 
reason must b e clearl y documented in CRF.  The patient will remain on study, baseline data 
will be collected and follow up will conti nue as described in the Schedule of Activities table .
5.1.1. Screen Failure
Patients who completed the informed consent process but do NOT meet all eligibility  criteria 
and therefore are NOT randomized to either treatment arm will be considered as screen 
failures. Please see Section 4.1and Section 4.2 for detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Clinical sites must provide for all screen failures the following information using the
appropriate CRFs
: screening number, demographic d ata as well as the fina l patient summary  
including the reason for screening failure .
5.2.Breaking the Blind
At the initiation of the trial, the trial site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind.  The method will be either a manual or electronic process.  Blinding co des should only  
be broken in emergency  situations for reason of patient safet y.  Blinding codes may also be 
broken after a patient discontinues treatment due to disease progression, as determined b y the 
treating investig ator using RECI ST v.1.1, but only ifdeemed essential to allow the 
investigator to select the patient's next treatment regimen and after discussion and agreement 
with the sponsor.  Code should not be broken in the absence of emergency  situations or 
progressive disease as per RECIST v.1.1 (eg, in case of clinical deterioration, increase in 
tumor markers or an y other evidence suggestive of disease progression but in the absence of 
RECI ST-defined disease progression).  When the blinding code is broken, the date and 
reason for unblinding must be fully  documented in source documents and entered on the 
CRF .  However, every  effort should be made b y the site staff to ensure that the treatment arm 
in which the unblinded patient is assigned is not communicated to an y sponsor personnel or 
designee involv ed in the conduct of the trial .

guidance.
5.4.2.1. P albociclib /Placebo
The patient number should be recorded on the bottle label in the spaces provided by  site 
personnel at the time of assignment to patient.  Site personnel must ensure that patients 
clearl y understand the directions for self -medicati on.  Patients should be given a sufficient 
supply  to last until their next study  visit.  Unused drug and/or empt y bottles should be 
returned to the site at the next study  visit.  Returned, unused medication MUST NOT be 
re-dispensed to the patient. 
Palboci clib/placebo is an agent that must be handled and administered with care.  Patients 
should be instructed to keep their medication in the bottles provided and not transfer it to an y 
other container.  Due to possible unknown hazards associated with topical a nd environmental 
exposure to experimental agents, capsules must not be opened and/or emptied into any  
vehicle for oral ingestion; capsules must be swallowed intact.
Only  one capsule strength will be dispensed to the patient at each dispensing visit.  I n the 
event of dose modification, request should be made of the patient to return all previously  
dispensed medication to the clinic and new capsules will be dispensed .
5.4.2.2. Cetuximab
Cetuximab is commercially  available in multiple presentations .  Presentations cont aining 
100mg of cetuximab per vial will be used in this study .  Commercial supplies of cetuximab 
will be centrall y sourced and provided to sites.
Do not shake or dilute the medication, and discard unused portion after 8 hours at controlled 
room temperatur e (20to 25C; 68F to 77F) or after 12 hours at 2 to 8C (36F to 46F).

Page 49Patients must be instructed to withhold their daily dose of palbociclib/placebo on 
pharmacokinetic sampling day s until the pre -dose pharmacokinetic sample and safet y 
assessments (ie, hematology , blood chemistry  and ECGs) have been completed.  On day s the 
patient is in the clinic, palbociclib/placebo will be taken when instructed b y the investigator.
Patients should take palbociclib /placebo with food. 
One p albociclib /placebo capsule will be administered once a day , orall y,for 21 days
followed b y 7days off treatment in28-day  cy cles.
Patients who miss a day ’s dose entirel y must be instructed NOT to “make it up” the next day.
Patients who vomit any time after taking a dose must be instructed NOT to “make it up,” and 
to resume treatment the next day  as prescribed. 
Patients who inadverte ntly take 1 extra dose during a day  must be instructed to skip the next 
day’s dose.  Also refer t o Section 8.4 for further details on medication errors and overdose .
Patients experiencing inve stigational product related toxicity  may  have their dose modified 
according to Section 5.5.3 .
Patients who become unable to swallow palbociclib/placebo capsules will discontinue study  
treatmen
t.
5.5.2. Cetuximab
All patients will be p remedicate dwith an H1 antagonist (eg, 50 mg of diphenhy dramine) 
intravenously  30-60 minutes prior to the first dose. All patients will also be premedicated 
with a corticosteroid at least 1 hour prior to administration o f the first dose of cetuximab .
Premedication should be administered for subsequent cetuximab doses based upon clinical
judgment and presence/severit y of prior infusion reactions .Note : Systemic dexamethasone 
use is not recommended due to possible drug-dr ug interactions .
Administer 400 mg/m2(initial dose) as a 120 -minute IV infusion with the maximum infusion 
rate of 10 mg/min.  Subsequent weekly  dose (all other infusions) is 250 mg/m2infused over 
60 minutes with the maximum infusion rate of 10 mg/min.  Detailed information can be 
found in the locally  approved package insert for Erbitux.  Note: do not administer 
cetuximab as an IV push or bolus.  Do not exceed an infusion rate of 10 mg/min .Body  
surface area will be calculated per institutional standard .  Patients need to be closel y 
monitored for all vital signs for the two hour duration of the initial cetuximab infusion, and 
for the one hour duration of subsequent infusions, plus an additional one hour after 
completion of all infusions.

Page 505.5.3. Recommended Dose Modifications
Every  effort should be made to administer study  treatment on the planned dose and schedule.  
However, in the event of significant treatment -related toxicity , administration of study  drugs 
(palbociclib /placebo or cetuximab ) may  need to be adjusted as described in the following 
sections.  Depending on the nature of the toxicity  observed, dosing adjustment may  be 
required for just one or both study  drugs in the combination. 
In the event of significant treatment- related toxicity , palbociclib /placebo and/or cetuximab
dosing may  be interrupted or delay ed and/or reduced as described below.  In the event of 
multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.  
Patients are to be instructed to notify  Investigators at the first occurrence of any  adverse sign 
or sy mptom.
Dose modifications may  occur in three way s:
Within a cy cle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and dose reduction, if 
required, during a given treatment cy cle;
Between cy cles: next cy cle adminis tration may  be delay ed due to persisting toxicity  
when a new cy cle is due to start;
In the next cycle: dose reduction may  be required in a subsequent cy cle based on 
toxicity  experienced in the previous cy cle.
Patients discontinuing palbociclib /placebo trea tment due to treatment -related toxicity  may  
continue on the active treatment phase of the stud y receiving cetuximab monotherap y as per 
the investigator’s discretion.  Patients discontinuing cetuximab treatment due to 
treatment -related toxicit y must also di scontinue palbociclib/placebo treatment
.
5.5.3.1. Cetux imab Dose Modification Guidelines
Dose reduction of cetuximab by 1 and, if needed, 2 dose levels ( Table 2) will be allowed 
depending on the t ype and severit y of toxicity encountered.  Patients requiring more than 
2dose reductions will be discontinued from the study  and entered into the follow -up phase.  
All dose modifications/adjustments must be clearly documented in the patient's source notes 
and Investigational product administration CRF .

Page 515.5.3.1.1. Cetuximab Hypersensitivity Reactions
Mild (G rade 1) hypersensitivity  reactions (HSRs) characterized b y mild pruritus, flushing, 
rhinitis, rash, and fever are treated with sy mptom -directed management, including cessation 
of infusion, administration of diphenh ydramine 25mg IVP (may  repeat x2), followed by  
famotidine 20 mg IV if sy mptoms remain after diphenhy dramine.  Vital signs should be 
monitored every  15minutes until sy mptoms resolve.  Treatment may  be restarted at the same 
rate at resolution of sy mptoms.
Moderate (Grade 2) HSRs consist of generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, back pain, dyspnea, 
hypotension, and rigors .  The infusion should be stopped, and ox ygen should be administered 
if the patient is experiencing dy spnea.  Normal saline 500 mL bolus may  be given if the 
patient is hy
potensive (may  repeat as needed).  Diphenhy dramine 50 mg IVP should be 
administered, followed by famotidine 20 mg IV followed by  hydrocortisone 100 mg IVP 
followed b y meperidine 25 mg IV (for rigors).  Vital signs should be monitored e very 
2minutes until stable, then every  15minutes until sy mptoms resolve.  Treatment may  be 
restarted at resolution of sy mptoms .
Severe (G rade 3) HSRs are characterized by  bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, 
hypotension, and angioedema.   These HSRs should be managed b y stopping the infusion and 
administering: normal saline 500 mL bolus (repeat as needed), epinephrine (1:1000) 0.3mg 
IM, diphenh ydramine 50 mg IVP, famotidine 20 mg IV, hydrocortisone 100 mg IVP, and 
albuterol 2.5 mg inhalation (for broncho spasms).  Vital signs should be monitored every  
2minutes until stable, then every  15minutes until sy mptoms resolve.  If cetuximab is 
restarted, restart the infusion rate at 25% of original rate for 30 minutes, then increase to 
50% of infusion rate for th
e remainder of the infusion.  The infusion rate should be 
permanentl y reduced b y 50%.
Life-threatening/disabling (G rade 4) HSRs consist of anaph ylaxis, airway  obstruction, shock, 
cardiac arrest, or prolonged hy potension.
Grade 4 HSRs require the immediate 
interruption of cetuximab therapy  and permanent 
discontinuation from further treatment with cetuximab.  Appropriate medical therap y 
including epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and 
oxygen should be available for use in the treatment of such reactions.  Patients should be 
carefully  observed until the complete resolution of all signs and sy mptoms .
5.5.3.1.2. Cetuximab Infusion Reactions
Severe infusion reactions (Grade 4) require the immediate interruption of cetuximab therap y 
andpermanent discontinuation from further treatment.  Appropriate medical therap y 
including epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and 
oxygen should be available for use in the treatment of such reactions.  Patients should be 
carefully  observed until the complete resolution of all signs and sy mptoms .

Reduce the infusion rate by  50% for National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity  
Criteria (NCI CTC v.4.03) Grade 1or 2 and non -serious Grade 3 infusion reactions;
Immediately  and permanently  discontinue cetuximab for serious infusion reactions, 
requiring medical internvention and/or hospitalization;
Review the information found in the locally
 approved package insert for Erbitux;
If a patient experiences recurrent fever following premedication and post -dosing with 
an appropriate antip yretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing should be 50% of 
previous rate.
5.5.3.1.3. Cetuximab Dermatological Toxicities
Patients developing dermatologic toxicities while receiving cetuximab should be monitored 
for the development of inflammatory  or infectious sequelae, and appropriate treatment of 
these sy mptoms initiated.  Dose modifications of any  future cetuximab infusions should be 
institu ted in case of severe (G rade 3) acneiform rash.  Treatment with topical and/or oral 
antibiotics ( minocy cline 100 mg bid ) should be considered.
In patients with mild and moderate skin toxicity , treatment should continue without dose 
modification.
Cetuximab recommended dose modifications for severe (NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4) acnei form 
rash are described in Table 3.

5.5.3.1.4. Cetuximab Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects
Antiemeti c agents may  be administered prior to the administration of cetuximab.  Diarrhea 
will be treated s ymptomatically  with antidiarrheal agents.  Should gastrointestinal toxicity  
become severe enough to require hospitalization or outpatient IV fluid replacement , all 
treatment should be discontinued temporaril y until the patient’s condition improves .  Patients 
experien cing treatment -related Grade 4 vomiting or diarrhea 
should have their cetuximab and
palbociclib/placebo treatments permanentl y discontinued.

Page 535.5.3.1.5. Cetuxi mab Pulmonary Adverse Effects
In the event of acute onset (G rade2) or worsening pulmonary  symptoms which are not 
thought to be related to underly ing cancer, cetuximab therapy  should be interrupted and a 
prompt investigation of these s ymptoms should occur .Cetuximab retreatment should not 
occur until these s ymptoms have resolved to Grade 1.  If interstitial lung disease is 
confirmed, cetuximab should be discontinued and the patient should be treated appropriatel y.
5.5.3.1.6. Cetuximab Renal Adverse Effects
Hypomagne semia has been reported with cetuximab when administered as a single agent and 
in combination with multiple different chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients receiving 
cetuximab should be monitored for h ypomagnesemia. Magnesium repletion may  be 
necessary  based on clinical judgment .
5.5.3.2. Palbociclib/Placebo Dose Modification Guidelines
5.5.3.2.1. P albociclib /Placebo Dosing Interruptions/Delays
Patients experien cing treatment- related Gr ade4 vomiting, diarrhea , or h ypertension should 
have their palbociclib/placebo andcetuxima btreatment spermanentl y discontinued.
Patients experien cing the following AE s should have their palbociclib /placebo treatment 
interrupted/delay ed: 
Uncomplicated Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm3);
Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm3) associated with a docu mented infection or 
fever 38.5C;
Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC<500/mm3);
Grade 4 thrombocy topenia (Platelet count <25,000/mm3);
Grade 3 non
-hematologic toxicity  (including, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
hypertension only  if persisting despite optimal medica l treatment);
Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities (see exceptions of vomiting, diarrhea, or 
hypertension above);
Grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTc  501 msec on at least two separate ECGs).
Appropriate follow up assessments should be done until adequate recovery occurs as 
assessed b y the Investigator. Criteria required before treatment can resume are described in 
Section 5.5.3.3.
Doses may  be held as needed until toxicity  resolution. Depending on w hen the AE resolved, 
a treatment interruption may  lead to the patient missing all subsequent planned doses within 
that same cy
cle or even to delay  the initiation of the subsequent cy cle. 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 54If the AE that led to the treatment interruption recovers within the same cycle, then re -dosing 
in that cy cle is allowed.  Doses omitted for toxicity are not replaced within the same cy cle.  
The need for a dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption should be based on the 
criteria defined in Section 5.5.3.4 unless expressly  agreed otherwise following discussion 
between the investigator and the sponsor. If a dose reduction is applied in the same cy cle, 
the patient will need to return to the clinic to rec eive new drug suppl y.
In the event of a treatment interruption for reasons other than treatment -related toxicity
(eg, non- cancer related surgery ) lasting >2 weeks, treatment resumption will be decided in 
consultation with the sponsor .
5.5.3.3.
Palbociclib /Placebo R etreatment
Retreatment following treatment interruption for treatment -related toxicit y or at the start of 
any new cy cle may  not occur until all of the following parameters have been met:
Platelet count 50,000/mm3; 
ANC 1000/mm3and no fever;
Grade 3 trea tment - related non-hematologic AEs (including, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, and h ypertension only  if persisting despite optimal medical treatment), with 
the exception of alopecia, have recovered to Grade 1 or baseline (or, at the 
investigator’s discretion, Grade2 if not considered a safet y risk for the patient);
Grade 4 treatment - related non-hematologic AEs with the exception of alopecia, have 
recovered to Grade 1 or baseline (or, at the investigator’s discretion, Grade 2 if not 
considered a safety  risk for the patient ).  Patients experiencing treatment-related 
Grade 4 vomiting, diarrhea, or h ypertension should have their palbociclib/placebo and
cetuximab treatments permanently  discontinued.  QTc <501 msec and potential 
reversible causes (eg, electroly te imbalance, concomitant medications known to 
prolong QTc) corrected.  If QTc remains above 480 msec, ECG sshould be monitored 
more frequently  as per the investigator’s best medical judgment until QTc480msec.
If a treatment delay  results from decline in he matologic parameters, the frequency  of blood 
count assessments should be increased as clinically indicated.
If these parameters are met within 2 weeks of treatment interruption or cy cle delay , 
palbociclib /placebo may  be resumed.  Refer to Section 5.5.3.4 for AE
s requiring dose 
reduction at the time of treatment resumption. 
If these parameters have not been met after 2 weeks of dos inginterruption (including the 
scheduled 1 week off treatment) or 2weeks of cycle delay , permanent discontinuation of 
palbociclib /placebo treatment should be considered.  Treatment resumption for patients 
recovering from treatment -related toxicit y after >2 weeks of treatment interruption or cy cle 
delay  but deemed to be deriving obvious clinical benefit per the investigator’s best medical 
judgment is left at the investigator’s discretion.

Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 55If palbociclib/placebo treatment is delay ed due to a palbociclib/placebo treatment- related 
toxicity  within a cy cle, the patient will continue cetuximab treatment and complete the 
28-day  cy cle.  A new cy cle will begin after the end of the standard previous 28 -day cy cle.  If 
the patient experiences prolonge d palbociclib/placebo treatment -related toxicity  beyond the 
standard one week brea k in the 28 -day cy cle (prior to Day 1 of the next cy cle), Day 1 of the 
next cy cle will begin when palbociclib/placebo treatment is resumed.  The re -treatment of 
cetuximab will be handled independent of palbociclib/placebo treatment, based upon the dose 
modification guidelines for cetuximab, see Section 5.5.3.1. 
In the event that the start of a new cy cle is delay ed due to treatment related toxicity , 
procedures required on Day 1 of the given cy c
le will be performed when palbociclib /placebo 
is resumed.  New cy cle Day 1 procedures (ie ,physical examination, ECOG performance 
status, ECG, Quality  of Life questionnaires, blood chemistry , hematology , urinaly sis, 
coagulation, and serum pregnancy  test) t hat were performed prior to knowing the need to 
delay  the start of the cy cle do not need to be repeated (1) if not required to determine whether 
study  drug may  be resumed and (2) if performed within 7 days prior to study  drug 
resumption.  All tumor assessm ents will occur as scheduled, independent of treatment delays,
and of cycle start delays .
5.5.3.4.
Palbociclib /Placebo Dose Reductions
Following dosing interruption or cy cle delay  the palbociclib /placebo dose may  need to be 
reduced when treatment is resumed.
No spe cific dose adjustments are recommended for Grade 1/2 treatment -related toxicity .  
However, investigators should alway s manage their patients according to their medical 
judgment based on the particular clinical circumstances.
Dose reduction of palbociclib /placebo by 1 and, if needed, 2 dose levels ( Table 4) will be 
allowed depending on the ty
pe and severit y of toxicity  encountered.  Patients requiring more 
than 2 dose reductions will be discontinued from palbociclib/placebo treatmen t and entered 
into the follow -up phase.  All dose modifications/adjustments must be clearly  documented in 
the patient's source notes and Investigational product administration CRF. 
Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cy cles should be 
administered at that dose level, unless further dose reduction is required.  Dose re -escalation 
is not allowed.

In the event of QTc prolongation, possible alternative reversible causes such as serum 
electrol ytes abnormalities, or usage of concomitant medications with the potential to prolong 
the QTc interval should be evaluated. 
If such reversi ble causes are identified, then they  should be corrected accordingly  
(ie,correction of electroly te abnormalities with supplements to within normal limits and/or 
discontinuation (if possible) of concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval). 
Recommended dose modifications in the event of QTc prolongation are provided in Table 6.

5.6.Drug Storage
The investigator, o r an approved representative, eg , pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products, including any  comparative agents and/or marketed products are 
stored in a secured area with controlled access under recommended storage conditions and in 
accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements.
Investigational product should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the 
drug label. 
Storage conditions stated in the Study  Reference Safet y Document (ie , IBor SPC) willbe 
super seded b y the storage conditions stated in the label ing.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting ( for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations ( as 
applicable, including frozen , refrigerated and/or room temperature products).  This must be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study .  Even for 
continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure which ensures active daily evaluation 
for excursion s must be available .  The operation of the temperature monitoring device and 
storage unit (for example, refrige rator), as applicable, must be regularl y inspected to ensure it 
is maintained in working order. 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 58Any excursions from the product label storage co nditions must be reported upon discovery .  
The site must actively  pursue options for returning the product to labeled storage conditions, 
as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, including any  actions taken, 
must be documented and re ported to the sponsor. 
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  
Specific details regar ding information the sit e should report for each excursion will be 
provided to the site. 
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where 
the product(s) are briefl y out of labeled temperature range are not considered 
excursions. More s pecific details will be provided to the sites separatel y.
Site staff will instruct patients on the storage requirements for take home medications
.
5.7. Drug Accountability
The investigator’s site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss , or 
other disposition of the drug supplies.
Medication must be kept in a secured locked area at the study  site in accordance with 
applicable regulatory  requireme nts.  Returned medication must be stored separately from 
medication that needs to be dispensed .
To ensure adequate records, palbociclib /placebo capsules will be accounted for as instructed 
by the sponsor.  Patients are requested to return previously  dispensed containers as well as 
their completed patient diary  to the clinic at each visit for accountability  purposes even if 
they will not be issued with new medication at that visit.
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational 
product ( eg, at the site).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the st udy site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
Pfizer and all destruction must be adequatel y documented.
5.8.Concom itant Treatment s
Patients must be instructed not to take an y additional medications (over -the-counter or other 
products) during the study  without prior consultation with the investigator.  Any  medications 
including 
herbal supplements, vitamins, or treatmen t taken by the patient from 28 days prior 
to the start of study  treatment and up to 28 days following the last dose of investigational 
product and the reason for their administrati on must be recorded on the CRF, which includes 
H1 antagonists pre -medication to alleviate cetuximab infusion reacions.  If a patient begins 
new therap y before the 28 -day time period is complete, concomitant medication information 
will not be recorded (from the start of the new therap y).

Page 59Routine postoperative care, such as dressing changes, suture removal, drain removal, or 
venous access (central or peripheral), does not need to be recorded.  Anesthetics used for an y 
surgical procedures performed during the patient’s participation in the study can be recorded 
as “unspecified anesthe sia” on the concomitant treatment records; it is not necessary  to list 
the specific anesthetics.  Palliative and supportive care for cancer -related s ymptoms will be 
offered to all patients in this study .
5.8.1. Prohibited Medications
The following treatments are prohibited throughout the duration of the active treatment 
phase: 
Anticancer agents: No additional investigational or commercial anticancer agents 
such as chemotherap y, targeted therapy , or biological response modifiers, will be 
permitted during the active treatment phase.  In general , any  drugs containing “for the 
treatment of 
SCCHN” on the product insert are not permitted on study .
Strong/Moderate CYP3A inhibitors/inducers: Palbociclib is metabolized to 
multiple metabolites in a qualitatively  similar manner in rat, dog and human liver 
microsomes.  In vitro, palbociclib is primarily  metabolized by  CYP3A4 enzy mes.  
Co-administration with drugs that are strong CYP3A inhibitors orinducers in vivo 
has been shown to change the pla sma concentrations of palbocic libin humans.   Data 
from a drug-drug interaction (DDI) stud y in healthy subjects indicate that 
coadministration of multiple 200-mg doses of the strong CYP3A inhibitor 
itraconazole with a single 125
-mg palbociclib dose increased palbociclib total 
exposure (AUC inf)andthe peak exposure (
Cmax)by approximatel y 87% and 34%, 
respectivel y, relative to a single 125 -mgpalbociclib dose given alone .  Data from a 
DDI study
in healthy  subjects indicate that coadmi nistration of multiple 600 -mg 
doses of the strong CYP 3A inducer rifampin with a single 125 -mg palbociclib dose 
decreased palbociclib AUC infand C maxby 85% and 70%, respectively , relative to a 
single 125- mg palbociclib dose given alone .The concurrent use of the compounds 
listed below is not allowed in the study : 
Strong /Moderate CYP3A inhibitors , including but not limited to amprenavir, 
atazanavir, boceprevir, clarithromy cin, conivaptan, delavirdine, diltiazem, 
erythromy cin, fosamprenavir, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, 
mibefradil, micona zole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, suboxone, telaprevir, telithrom ycin, verapamil, voriconazole, and 
grapefruit, grapefruit juice or an y product containing grapefruit.
Strong /Moderate CYP3A inducers , including but not limite d to carbamazepine,
felbamate, nevirapine, phenobarbital, phen ytoin, primidone, rifampin, rifabutin, 
rifapentin, and St. John’s wort .
Drugs known to cause QT interval prolongation are prohibited during the active 
treatment phase.  Refer to Appendix 6for a list of drugs known to predispose to 
Torsade de Pointes.

A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 605.8.2. Medications Not Recommended 
The following treatments are not recommended throughout the duration of the active 
treatment phase.  Alternative therapies should be considered whenever possible.  If usage of 
the following treatments is deemed necessary, consultation and agreement with the sponsor is 
required prior to treatment initiation . 
The concurrent use of sy stemic dexamethasone is not recommended. Topical use of 
dexam ethasone is permitted.
Chronic immunosuppressive therapies should be avoided, including s ystemic 
corticosteroids.  Steroids given as premedication for cetuximab infusion reactions, or
short course of oral steroids , or inhaled/topical steriods are allowed.
The use of herbal medicine is not recommended during the active treatment phase. 
5.9. Concomitant Radiotherapy or Surgery
Any concurrent radiotherapy (except palliative radiotherap y as specified below) or 
cancer -related surgery  are prohibited throughout the duration of the active treatment phase of 
the study .  Patients requiring any  of these procedures will be discontinued from the active 
treatment phase and will enter the follow -up phase.
Palliative radiotherap y is permitted for the treatment of painful bony l esions provided that the 
lesions were known to be present at the time of study  entry  and the investigator clearl y 
documents that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression.  
In view of the current lack of data about the i nteraction of palbociclib with radiotherap y, 
palbociclib /placebo treatment should be interrupted during palliative radiotherap y, stopping 
1day before and resuming treatment 1 week after.  For patients with bone involvement, it is 
suggested to institute pa lliative radiotherap y before study  initiation if possible and clinicall y 
appropriate ( eg, lesions at risk for spontaneous micro- fractures or painful lesions).  Palliative 
radiotherap y during the active treatment phase will be considered alternative cancer therapy  
and will result in censoring of the PFS endpoint.  The dates on which palliative radiotherap y 
is administered should be recorded on the appropriate CRFs. 
Caution is advised on theoretical grounds for an y surgical procedures during the study .  The 
appropriate interval of time between surgery  and palbociclib required to minimize the risk of 
impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined.  Based on the available 
pharmacokinetic data, stopping palbociclib /placebo is recommended at least 7 days prior to 
elective surgery .  Postoperativel y, the decision to reinitiate palbociclib /placebo treatment 
should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory  wound healing and recovery  from 
surger y.
6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
Prior to undergoing any study specific procedures (with the exception of certain imaging 
assessments if meeting the criteria defined in Section 6.1), patients must read and sign the 
consent form.  All study  procedures and the timing when they  must be performed are detailed 
in the S chedule of Activities .  All data obtained for these assessments must be supported in 
the patients' source documentation.

persistent toxicity  delay s the initiation of the subsequent cy cle.
When scheduled at the same nominal time, triplicate ECGs should be collected prior to an y 
blood draws for PK, biomarkers, or safet y labs and prior to placemen t of the IV line for 
cetuximab administration.
6.1.Screening
Voluntary , written, dated, and signed informed consent must be obtained before an y stud y 
specific procedures are performed (with the exception of certain imaging assessments if 
meeting the criteria d efined in this section); however, it may  be obtained more than 28 days 
before randomization
.  See Section 4.1 and Section 4.2for detailed inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.
Medical and oncological history  must include information on prior anticancer treatments.
Baseline tumor related signs and sy mptoms will be recorded at the C1D1 visit prior to 
initiating treatment an d then report ed as AEs during the trial if they  worsen in severity  or 
increase in frequency .
Radiographic tumor assessments (as documented on the Tumor Assessment Requirements 
Flowchart ) that were performed before the signing of the informed consent form as routine 
procedures (but 
within 28 days prior to randomization ) do not need to be repeated and may  
be used as baseline assessments, as long as:
The tests were performed per the method requirements outlined in the Tumor 
Assessment Requirements Flowchart ,andSection 7.1, and
Appropriate documentation indicating that these radiographic tumor assessments 
were performed as standard of care is available in the patient’s source notes .
Patients must be HPV -negative to participate in this study .  Anal ytical method is per 
institutional standards
.
For details on screenin g/baseline procedures, see the Schedule of Activities.
6.2. Active Treatment Phase
For details on procedures during the active treatment phase, see the S chedule of Activities. 
Physical examination/vital signs, blood chemistry, hem atology , urinaly sis,coagulation, and 
12-lead ECG are not required if acceptable screening assessment is performed within 7 days 
prior to randomization .
Patients must agree to use two methods of highly  effective contraception throughout the 
study  and conti nue for 6 months after the l ast dose of cetuximab.  See Section 4.4for further 
information.

Page 62Hemoglobin A1c will be measured at C1D1, during the active treatment phase every  
3months fr om the date of randomization (ie , Cycle4 Day 1, Cycle 7 Day 1, Cy cle10 Day 1, 
etc.), and at the End of T reatment visit.  Fasting glucose will be acquired at baseline Cy cle1 
Day 1, Cy cle1 Day 15, and Cy cle2 Day 1.
In the event that the start of a new cy cle is delay ed due to treatment
-related toxicity , 
procedures required on Day  1 of the given cy cle will be performed wh en palbociclib /placebo 
is resumed. New cy cle Day  1 procedures (ie, phy sical examination, vital signs, ECOG 
performance status, ECG, Quality  ofLife questionnaires, blood chemistry , hematology , 
urinaly sis, coagulation, and serum pregnancy  test) that were performed prior to knowing the 
need to delay  the start of the cy cle do not need to be repeated (1) if not required to determine 
whether stud y drug may  be resumed and (2) if performed within 7 days prior to study  drug 
resumption.
6.3.End of Treatment Visit
The e nd of treatment visit will be performed as soon as possible but no later than 4 weeks 
(ie,
28days) 7days from last dose of investigational p roduct and prior to the initiation of 
any new anticancer therapy .
For all patients, including patients starting post -study  anticancer therapy , 8weeks after the 
completion of therap y, blood chemistry panel consisting of magnesium, total calcium, and 
potass ium must be checked.
Patients must continue to use two methods of highly  effective contraception for 6 months 
after the last dose of cetuximab.
For details on procedures to be performed at the End of Treatment visit, see the S chedule of 
Activities.
6.4.Follow -up Visit
After discontinuation of study  treatment, post -study  survival status (including post study  
anticancer therapies) will be collected approximately  every  2months (7days) from th e last 
dose of study  treatment .  Telephone contact is acceptable.
Patients who discontinue study  treatment for reasons other than radiographically  and/or 
clinically  (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) documented disease progression ,as per 
RECI ST v. 1.1 definitions, will continue to have tumor assessme nt performed during the 
follow -up visits every  8weeks (7days) from the date of randomization until disease 
progression, initiation of new anticancer therap
y or discontinuation of patient from overall 
study  participation ( eg, death, patient's request, lo st to follow -up), whichever occurs first. 
For details on follow- up visit procedures , see the Schedule of A ctivities.

Four weeks after discontinuation of study  treatment due to progressive disease, patients will 
be asked to complete the EORTC -QLQ -C30 ( Appendix 3) and EORTC -QLQ -H&N35 
(Appendix 4)assessments .  For details, see the Schedule of Activities.
6.6.Patient Withdrawal
6.6.1. Active Treatment Phase Discontinuation
The term "interruption" refers to a patient stopping the investigational product during the 
course of the stud y, but then re -starting it at a later time in the study .  The reason for dosing 
interruption will be collected on the appropria te CRF. 
The term "discontinuation" refers to a patient's withdrawal from the active treatment phase.  
The reason for discontinuation from treatment will be collected on the appropriate CRF. 
Patients may  be withdrawn from the active treatment phase in cas e of:
Disease progression as per RECI ST v.1.1; 
Symptomatic deterioration ( ie, development of inability  to swallow or global 
deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression as per RECI ST v.1.1);
Need for additional anticancer therapy not specified in the protocol;
Unacceptable toxicities; 
Investigator conclusion that it is in the patient’s best interest to discontinue therap y 
(eg, poor compliance with either protocol monitoring or with taking the study  
medications, etc.);
Lost to follow -up;*
Patient choice to withdraw from treatment (follow
-up permitted b y patient);
Withdrawal of patient consent (cessation of follow- up);
Death.
*If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
patient.  Lost to follow -up is defined by  the inability  to reach the patient
after a minimum of 
three documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as wel l as lack of response by the patient to 
one registered mail letter.  A ll attempts should be documented in the patient ’s medical 
records.  If it is determined that the patient has died, the site will use permissible local 
methods to obtain the date and cause of death.  If investigator’s use of third -party 
representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study  has been included in the patient’s 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 64informed consent, then the investigator may  use a Sponsor retained third -party  representative 
to assist site staff with obtaining patient’s contact information or other public vi tal status data 
necessary  to complete the follow -up portion of the study .  The site staff and representative 
will consult publicly  available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in 
order to obtain updated contact information.  If after all attempts, the patient remains lost to 
follow -up, then the last known alive date as determined by  the investigator should be 
report ed and documented in the patient ’s medical records.
Patient who discontinue from the active treatm ent phase must have End of 
Treatment/W ithdrawal evaluations performed as soon as possible but no later than 4 weeks 
from the last dose of investigational product and prior to initiation of any  new anticancer 
therap y.  Data to be collected for the end of stud y treatment/withdrawal are described in the 
Schedule of A ctivities. 
Patient s who request to discontinue study  treatment will remain in the study  and must 
continue to be followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures.  The only  exception to 
this is when a p atient specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact with him/her or 
persons previousl y authorized by patient to provide this i nformation.  Patient s should notify  
the investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up in writin g, 
whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical 
records b y the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study 
drug only  or also from study  procedures and/or post treatment study follow -up, and entered 
on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that v ital status (whether the patient is alive or 
dead) is being measured, publicly  available information should be used to determine vital 
status only  as appropriately  directed in accorda nce with local law .
If a patient opts to discontinue from the active treatment phase as a result of an unacceptable 
adverse drug reaction, "withdrawal of consent" should not be the reason for discontinuation.  
Instead, the reason for discontinuation of active treatment phase must be recorded as 
"Unacceptable toxicit y" and an appropriate action taken must be assigned on the AE CRF to 
the AE leading to the patient’s withdrawal of consent .
6.6.2. Study Discontinuation
Patients may  withdraw from the study  at an y time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability  of the patient to comply  with the protocol required schedule of study  
visits or procedures at a given study  site.
Patients will be withdrawn from study in the case of:
Withdrawal of consent ( ie, refuses tumor assessments or survival status after end of 
treatment );
Lost to follow -up;*
Administrative study  closure by  sponsor;
Death. 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 65*If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
patient.  If after three unsuccessful attempts to contact the patient, one of which is by  
registered letter, the patient should be considered “lost to follow -up”.  Steps taken to contact 
the patient ( eg, dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc.) must be clearly  documented in 
the source documents.  In any  circumstance, every  effort should be made to document patient 
outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire ab out the reason for withdrawal, 
requests the patient to return all unused investigational product(s), request the patient to 
return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -up with the patient regarding any unresolved 
AEs.
Data to be collected for the e nd of study  treatment/withdrawal are described in the Schedule 
of Activities. 
If the patient withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no addit ional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent .
7.ASSESSMENTS
All study  procedures are described in the Schedule of Activities table and footnotes.
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary  to ensure the 
safet y and well- being of the patient.   When a protocol -required test cannot be performed the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions 
which he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  
The study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion
.
7.1.Efficacy Assessments
7.1.1. Tumor Assessments
The importance of timely and c omplete disease assessments in this study  cannot be 
understated.  Disease assessments must be performed as scheduled according to the calendar , 
regardless of treatment delay s resulting from toxicity , to prevent the introduction of bias into 
the assessment of efficacy .  Failure to perform any  of the required disease assessments will 
result in the inability  to determine disease status for that time point.  A series of incomplete 
disease assessments will result in censorin gof the secondary  endpoint of PFS back to the 
time of the last fullassessment that did not show progression.  Frequent off schedule or 
incomplete disease assessments have the potential to weaken the conclusion of this clinical 
trial.
Objective tumor response will be measured using RECI ST v. 1.1.  All measurements should 
be recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.

Page 66MRI  of the abdomen can be substituted for CT if MRI  adequatel y depicts the disease.   
However, MRI  of the chest should not be substituted for CT of chest even if IV cont rast is 
contraindicated.  In such case CT will be performed without contrast.  If MRI  is used to 
follow -up bone lesion(s) it must be performed a few day s before an y treatment that may  
affect bone -marrow cellularity  (eg, G -CSF).
7.1.1.1. Screening/Baseline Tumor A ssessment
Screening/baseline tumor assessment will be carried out within 28 days before randomization 
(unless otherwise specified below). 
Disease assessment for all patients at baseline will include:
Computed tomography  (CT)or magnetic resonance imaging (M RI) scan of the head 
and neck (oral cavity , orophary nx, hy popharynx, lary nx);
CT or MRI  scan of the chest and abdomen (including the liver);
CT or MRI  scan of an y other sites of disease as clinically  indicated. 
Baseline brain scans are required in patient s with a history  of metastatic brain disease.  Brain 
scans performed before the signing of informed consent as routine procedures (but within 
6weeks before randomization) do not need to be repeated and may  be used as baseline 
assessments as long as (1) te sts were performed using the method requirements outlined in 
RECI ST v.1.1 (2) the same technique/modality  can be used to follow identified lesions 
throughout the trial for a given patient (3) appropriate documentation indicating that these 
radiographic tum or assessments were performed as standard of care is available in the 
patient’s sou rce notes.  Post -baseline brain scans will be required onl y if new metastases are 
suspected.
Clinical assessment of superficial disease which will include photographs of all superficial 
metastatic lesions.  All lesion measurements must be recorded in the CRF .
7.1.1.2. Post- Baseline Tumor A ssessments
Post-baseline tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (7days) from 
randomization until radiographicall y and/or clinically  (ie, for photographed or palpable 
lesions) documented PD as per RECI STv.1.1, initiation of new anticancer therap y, or 
discontinuation of patient from overall stud y participation ( eg, death, patient's request, lost to 
follow -up).  Imaging assessments are to b e scheduled using the randomization date as the 
reference date for all time -points and are NOT to be scheduled based on the date of the 
previous imaging time -point.  I maging assessment delay  to conform to treatment delay  is not 
permitted.
Patients who disc ontinue study  treatment for reasons other than radiographically  and/or 
clinically  (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) documented disease progression as per 
RECI ST definitions will continue to have tumor assessment performed during the follow-up 
visits every  8weeks (7days) until documented disease progression, initiation of new

Page 67anticancer therap y or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation ( eg, death, 
patient's request, lost to follow- up), whichever occurs first.  Every  effort sh ould be made to 
perform a last tumor assessment before starting a new anticancer therap y.  Additional 
unscheduled tumor assessments may  be performed as clinically  indicated at any  time. 
Post-baseline tumor assessments will include:
Clinical assessment of sites of superficial disease identified at baseline.  Clinical 
assessment of superficial disease must coincide with the imaging studies and will 
include photographs of all superficial metastatic lesions.  All lesion measurements 
must be recorded in the CRF .
The CT scans, including brain CT scan if applicable, should be performed with 
contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons.  If IV contrast is medically 
contraindicated, the imaging modality  to be used to follow the disease (either CT 
witho ut contrast or MRI) should be the modality  which best evaluates the disease, and 
the choice should be determined by  the investigator in conjunct ion with the local 
radiologist.
CT or MRI  scan of the head and neck (oral cavity, orophary nx, hy popharynx, lary nx).
CT or MRI  scan of the chest and abdomen (including the liver).
CT or MRI  scan of an y other sites of disease identified at baseline .
The same method and technique should be used to characterize each lesion identified and 
reported at baseline, during the study  treatment period and during follow -
up.  The use of 
plain- film X -rays is discouraged.  The use of positron emission tomography  (PET) imaging 
as the only  imaging modality  is not permitted .
7.1.2. Overall Survival
Following the End of Treatment visit, surviva l status will be coll ected in all patients every  
2months (7days) from the last dose of study  treatment.  I nformation on subsequent 
anticancer therap y will also be collected .
7.2.Pregnancy Testing
For female patient s of childbearing potential, a serum pregna ncy test, with sensitivity  of at 
least 25 mIU/mL and a ssayed in a certified laboratory , will be performed on 2 occasions 
prior to starting study  therapy -once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit, 
immediately  before investigational produ ct administration.  A negative pregnancy  result is 
required before the patient may
 receive the investigational product. Pregnancy  tests will als o 
be routinely  repeated at Day 1 of each cycle during the active treatment per iod, at the End of 
Treatment Visi t,and additionally  whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed or when potential 
pregnancy  is otherwise suspected. Additional pregnancy  tests may  also be undertaken if 
requested b y IRBs/ECsor if required b y local regulations.  In the case of a positive 
confirm ed pregnancy , the patient will be withdrawn from study  medication and will be

throughout the study  and continue for 6 months after the last dose of cetuximab.  See 
Section 4.4 for further information.
7.3.Safety Assessments
Safety  assessment will consist of monitorin g of all AEs , including SAEs , regular monitoring 
of hematology , serum chemistry , and routine monito ring of ECGs, phy sical examinations, 
vital signs, and ECOG performance status. 
AEassessment will include ty pe, incidence, severity  (graded b y the NCI CTCAE , 
Version 4.03, Section 8.8), timing, seriousness, and relatedness.
Baseline tumor- related signs and sy mptoms will be recorded at the Cy cle 1 Day  1 visit an d 
then reported as AE s during the trial if they  worsen in severity  or increase in frequency .

(PT)/INR, and alkaline phosphastase.
Blood tests will be drawn at the time points described in the Schedule of A ctivities, and 
analyzed at local laboratories.  Additional blood tests may  be performed at the investigator's 
discretion as clinicall y indicated for the purpose of planning treatment administration, dose 
modificat ion, or following AE s.

Page 69For all patients, including patients starting post -study  anticancer therapy , 8weeks after the 
completion of therap y, blood chemistry panel consisting of magnesium, total calcium, and 
potassium must be checked.  If abnormalities are observed, an ECG can be performed at the 
discretion of the investigator to check QTc.
Urinaly sis will be conducted via urine dipstick for urine protein: if the result is positive, 
further diagnostic testing will be performed as clinically  indicated.
Patients must be HPV -negative to participate in this study .  Anal ytical method is per 
institutional standards
.
Refer to the S chedule of Activities for laboratory assessment details.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) ;
All ECGs will be performed using a 12-lead (with a 10- second rhy thm strip) tracing.  
ECG measurements will include PR interval, QT interval, RR int erval, and QRS 
complex.  I t is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the 
standard intervals automatically . 
ECG interval readings by the ECG recorder’s algorithm will be read and interpreted at the 
investigational site for eligibilit y determination and patient safet y monitoring and 
documentation stored in the source documents. 
Triplicate ECGs will be performed for all patients . 
All ECGs should be obtained after a fast of at least 1 hour .  When scheduled at the 
same nominal time /visit, triplicate ECGs should be collected prior to an y blood draws 
for PK, biomarkers, or safety  labs and prior to placement of the IV 
linefor cetuximab 
administration.
Triplicate ECGs will be obtained for safet y monitoring at Screening, and 0 hour 
(palbocic lib pre-dose) on C1D1, C1D15 and C2D15, then on Day 1 of C ycles4, 7, 
and 10.  ECGs will be obtained at the time of End of Treatment or Withdrawal.  
ECGs bey ond C ycle10 will be performed as clinically  indicated.
Additional ECGs may  be performed as clinica lly indicated at an y time.
For the purpose of the study , triplicate ECGs are defined as three consecutive ECGs 
performed approximatel y 2minutes apart but within 10 minutes for all 3 ECGs at the 
protocol specified timepoints (see theSchedule of Activities for details) to determine the 
mean QTc interval. 
If at an y time during the course of treatment, the mean QTc is prolonged ( 501msec on at 
least two separate ECGs, ie , CTCAE Grade 3), then the ECGs should be re -evaluated b y a 
qualified pe rson at the site for confirmation as soon as the finding is made, including 
verification that the machine reading is accurate.  If manual reading confirms a QTc of 

Palbociclib (PD-0332991)
A5481044Final Protocol Amendment 2, 31 March 2016
Page 70501 msec, immediate search for reversible causes (including electrolyte abnormalities, 
hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the potential to prolong the QTc 
interval) should be performed.  In addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3 hours until the QTc interval falls below 501 msec. 
If QTc interval reverts to less than 501 msec, and in the judgment of investigator(s) in 
consultation with the sponsor the cause is determined to be other than study drug, 
treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring under hospital supervision. 
If in that timeframe the QTc intervals remain above 501 msec the study drug will be 
held until the QTc interval decreases to <501 msec. 
Prior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug, 
thorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in patient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and possible evaluation by specialist.
If investigational product causality cannot be ruled out, Investigational product dose 
adjustment and/or discontinuation should be performed according to instructions provided in Section 5.5.3 .  Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated. 
When matched with PK sampling, ECG must be carried out before PK sample drawing such 
that the PK samples are collected at the nominal time (ie, the timing of the PK collections over rides the timing of the ECG collections).
7.3.2. Other Safety Assessments
A full physical examination including an examination of all major body systems (including
head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, breasts, abdomen, and musculoskeletal), height (at screening only), weight, blood pressure and pulse rate whichmay be performed by a physician, registered nurse or other qualified health care provider, will be required at screeni ng, and Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2. 
Symptom directed physical examinations, blood pressure and pulse rate will be performed at 
subsequent visits.
Performance Status: ECOG performance status scale will be used (see Appendix 5 ).

Page 72The actual times may  change but the number of samples will remain the same.   All efforts 
will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the exact nominal time relative to 
dosing.
  However, pre -infusion samples drawn within 30 minutes of the start of infusion and 
post-infusion samples collected within 10% of the planned nominal time (eg, within 
6 minutes of the end of a 60 minute infusion) from dosing will not be captured as protocol 
deviations, as long as the exact time of the sample collection and th e exact infusion start/stop 
times are noted on the source docum ent and data collection tool (eg , CRF).
One 3 mL sample of venous blood , to provide a minimum of 1 mL serum for PK anal ysis,
will be collected in toappropriatel y labeled collection tubes contai ning no additives at the 
protocol -specified times.  Samples will be kept in an ice bath prior to processing.
Samples will be analy zed for cetuximab using a validated anal ytical method in compliance 
with Pfizer standard operating procedures. 
As part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the study  drug, samples may  be used for 
metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanaly tical method.   These data will be 
used for internal exploratory  purposes and will not be included in the C linical Study  R
eport.
Samples collected for this purpose will be retained in accordance to local regulations and if 
not used within this timeframe, will be destro yed.
Additional blood samples may  be requested from patients experiencing une xpected or serious 
AEs, or AE s that lead to discontinuation.
Blood samples for PK assessments of c etuximab will be collected from all participating
patients prior to IV infusion (pre- dose) and immediately prior to completion of the IV 
infusion (post- dose) on Day 15of Cycles 1 and 2. In the event a pre -dose or post -dose 
sample cannot be/is not collected on Day 15of Cycle 1 or C ycle 2 as scheduled, every  effort 
should be ma de to collect a makeup sample on Day 22of the same cy cle or onDay 15 or
Day 22of an y subsequent cy cles bey ond C
ycle2 following the same rules described above.   
Blood samples for post -dose PK assessments of cetuximab should not be collected from the 
same arm that the cetuximab IV infusion was administered.
When assessments are scheduled on the same visit, whenever p ossible, efforts should be 
made to coordinate collection of pre- infusion PK and biomarker blood draws within a 
30-minute window.
Refer to the Study Manual for detailed collection, processing and shipping procedures .
7.5. Biomarker Assessments
Archival t umor tissues are required from all patients for study  participation. 
Submission of formalin -fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples (blocks preferred) of 
adequate size (to generate at least 15 sections of 5- micron each) are needed.  If FFPE tissue 
block can not be provided, a minimum of 15 glass slides each containing an unstained

Page 76Patients will comple te each instrument at pre -dose on Day 1 of C ycles 1-3, then on Day 1 of 
every  other subsequent Cy cle starting with Cy cle5 (eg, Cycles5, 7, 9, etc. ), and then at the 
End of T reatment visit.   This schedule is based on the schedule for the assessment of cli nical 
activity .  Four weeks after discontinuation of study treatment due to progressive disease, 
patients
, including patients starting post -study  anticancer therapy ,will be completing the 
quesstionaires at the Follow- up Visit .
Patients must complete these instruments in clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to 
having an y tests and to any discussion of their progress with healthcare personnel at the site.  
Interviewer administration in clinic may  be used under special circumstances ( eg, patient 
forgot the ir glasses or feels too ill) , but family  members are not permitted to assist with 
questionnaire administration .  The instruments will be given to the patient in the appropriate 
language for the site. 
7.7.1. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Instrument (EORTC QLQ -C30) ( Appendix 3)
The EORTC QLQ C30 is a 30 item questionnaire composed of five multi item functional 
subscales (ph ysical, role, cognitive emotional, and social functioning), three mult i item 
symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health/quality  of life (QOL) 
subscale, and six single items assessing other cancer related s ymptoms (dy spnea, sleep 
disturbance, appetite, diarrhea, constipation, and the financial impact of cancer).  The 
questionnaire emplo ys 28 4 point L ikert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very  
much” and two 7 point Likert scales for global health and overall QOL.  For functional and 
global QOL scales, higher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to 
a 0 to 100 scale.  For s ymptom oriented scales, a higher score represents more severe 
symptoms.
7.7.2.
European Organisation for Research and Tre atment of Cancer Head and Neck 
Module 35 (EORTC QLQ -H&N35) ( Appendix 4)
The EORTC QLQ -
H&N35 is designed to be used together with the core QLQ- C30.   The 
time frame of the module is ‘‘during the past week,’’ and the format is similar to that of the 
core questionnaire.   Items hn 1 to hn30 are scored on four -
point Likert-type categorical 
scales (‘‘not at all,’’ ‘‘a little,’’ ‘‘quite a bit,’’ ‘‘very  much’’).   Items hn31 to hn35 have a 
‘‘no/y es’’ response format.  The scores are transformed into 0- to-100 scales, with a high 
score imply ing a high level of sy mptoms o r problems, in the same way  as scoring for 
symptom scales and single items of the QLQ- C30.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product( s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 77For all AEs , the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a
serious adver seevent (SAE ) requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated 
representative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by  the investigator to 
determine the causality  of the AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  
Follow -up by  the investigator may  be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non serious 
AEthat is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by  the s ponsor as a n SAE .  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness ,further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the ev
ent in the context of the clinical 
study . 
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAE s, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient ’s 
participa tion in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar day s after the last 
administration of the investigational product.  SAEs occurring to a patient after the act ive 
reporting period has ended should be reported to the s ponsor if the investigator becomes 
aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a 
reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be r eported to the 
sponsor.
AEs (serious and nonserious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has 
taken at least 1dose of investigational product through thepatient’s last visit.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy , the AE report ing period for nonserious AEs ends 
at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE
reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of an y intervening 
treatment.
8.3.Definition of an Ad verse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not l imited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 78Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  should be reported 
as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed by  
measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be 
reported as AEs .
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or con sumption of the 
wrong product , by the wrong patient , at the wrong time, at the wrong dosage strength , or 
inadvertent exposure.   Such medication errors occurring to a study  participant are to be 
captured on the 
medicatio n error CRF which is a specific versi on of the AE page ,and on the 
SAE form when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be 
notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication erro rs involving patient exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating patient .

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 79Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, as determined by  the 
investigator, the medication error iscaptured on the medication erro r version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abn ormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention ;
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any  of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any  untoward medical occu rrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions)
;
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and symptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as a nSAE unless the outcome is fatal within the 
safet y reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and sy mptoms of disease 
progression should not be reported as anSAE . If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome 
during the study  or within the safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death 
must be r ecorded as an AEand as a nSAE with Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTC AE) Grade 5 (see the s ection on Severity  Assessment ).

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 80Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an importa nt 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or de velopment of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protoco l-specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported by  the 
investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the s ection onSerious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug
-Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal va lues in asparate aminotransferase ( AST )and/or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT)
levels con current with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should always be consi dered 
important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the patient ’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Patient s who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory
 values:
Patient s with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values 3times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value  2 X ULN with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value 2X ULN or not available ;
For patient s with preexisting AL TOR AST OR total bilirubin values above the ULN , 
the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above:
For 
patient s with pre existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT values  2times the baseline values and 3 XULN, or 
8 X ULN (whichever is small er).
Concurrent with
For patient s with preexisting values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by  an amount of at least 1X ULN or
if the value reaches 3 X ULN (whichever is smaller).

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 81The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history ,physical assessment , and primary or secondary  
hepatic neoplasia should be considered.
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include 
albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/ international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline 
phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact with a jaundiced person , surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( e
g, biliary  tract) 
may be warranted.   All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above , with no other cause for liver function test ( LFT
)abnormalities identified at 
the time ,should be considered potential Hy ’s law cases irrespective of availability  of all the 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnor mal L FTs.  Such 
potential Hy ’s law cases should be reported as SAEs.
8.7.Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility  or any  prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit) . An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance .
Hospitaliza tion does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care ( eg,caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolon gation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical 
AEis not in itself a nSAE .  Examples include: 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 82Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AEor with a worsening of the preexisting condition ( eg, for 
work up of persistent pre
-treatment lab oratory abnormality );
Social admission ( eg,patient has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission ( eg,for yearly physical exam ination );
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg,for a proc edure required by  the study  
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient ;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8.Severity Assessment
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (interfere s significantly  with 
the patient 's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for 
SAE s, listed below .
Investigators report AE s using concise medical terminology  (verbatim) as well as collect on 
the CRF the appr opriate Common Terminology  Crite ria (CTC) term for AE s (Version 4.03, 
Publish Date:  June 14, 2010, http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html)) listed in the Cancer 
Therap y Evaluation Program. 
The investigator will use the following definitions of Severit y in accordance with the current 
CTC Version to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.

Version 4.03 CTC AEdocument but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD AE
2 MODERATE AE
3 SEVERE AE
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO AE
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious an d 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of w hether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor (see the s ection on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investiga tor's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product ," 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that anSAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure 
During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while rece iving or having been 
exposed ( eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product
;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with 
a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman ( eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 84Ifastudy  patient or study  patient ’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient ’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the Pfizer drug safety unit on a SAE Report Form and EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman ( eg, a 
patient reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed t o a cy totoxic product by  inhalation 
or spillage) using the EDP supplemental f orm.  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AEhas occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer of the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event o f a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gros s visual inspection (unless pre procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenita l anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAE s follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAE s.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possi bly related to 
exposure to theinvestigational product .
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by  the 
investigator.  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on pre term infants to identify  developmental delay s).In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner. The i nvestigator must document 
in the sourc e 
documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to th e occurrence of an AE .

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 85An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet yunitwithin 24 hours of the
Investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF , however a cop y of the completed SAE Report form 
is maintained in the investigator sit efile.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section on Patient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on t he appropriate AECRF 
page. 
When a patient withdraws because of an SAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and a ll AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  patient /legall y acceptable representative .  In addition, each study  patient /legally  
acceptable representative will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If anSAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator awarenes s of the 
event .
In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer must be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This time frame also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on pre viously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of exposure during pregnancy ,exposure via 
breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his or her first awareness of the AE.
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fa shion.  This i nformation collected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 86medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Nons erious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF. Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AEreporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a statistical analy sis plan(SAP) , which will be maintained by  the 
sponsor.  This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; how ever, an y major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate that the combination of palbociclib with 
cetuxi mab is superior to cetuximab i n prolonging OS in the target population.  This study  is 
designed to test the null hy pothesis of equal survival between the treatment arms versus the 
alternative hypothesis of improved survival in the palbociclib + cetuxim ab arm compared 
with the placebo + cetuximab arm.
Assuming a medi an OS of 6 months in the comparator arm, approximatel y 79total events
(death s)are required for1:1 randomization to have at least 80% power to detect a true hazard 
ratio of 0.6 (correspondi ng to a median OS of 10 month in the palbociclib arm) using a 
one-sided, log- rank test at a significance level of 0.1.  The formal futility  boundary  will be 
constructed using the Gamma family  of spending function with parameter = 0.05.  With 
40observed ev ents at the interim analy sis, the futilit y boundary  is p
-value = 0.36 
(corresponding to HR = 0.9) . The boundary  at final anal ysis is p-vlaue = 0.1.
Approximately  120patients will be enrolled in about 16 months and followed for additional
6months to obse rve the required number of events.  This estimation is based on the 
following assumptions on the enrollment rates: 1) 5 patients per month (on average) during 
the first 6 months; 2) 10 patients per month (on average) thereafter .

Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 879.2.Efficacy Analysis
9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
All randomized patients will be included in this analy sis.  Survival time is defined as the time 
from the date of randomization to the date of death.   Since the date of randomization and the 
date of death should be counted as a full day , 1day will be added to each calculation.   
Patients alive will have their survival times censored on the last date of known contact that 
the patient was documented to be alive.   Patients lacking data bey ond the day  of 
randomization will have their surviva l times censored at Day 1. 
For each arm, estimates of the survival curves from the Kaplan -Meier method will be 
presented.  Median survival times and 2-sided 95% and 80% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the medians will be provided using the Brookmeyer
-Crowl ey method.  The survival 
probabilities at4,6 and 12 months will be estimated.
Differences in survival between treatment arms will be tested using the stratified log -rank 
test where the stratification factors are ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) and prior use of 
immunotherapy (yes vs. no).  The stratisfied analy sis will be the primary  analy sis.  As a 
sensitivity  anal ysis, the unstratified log
-rank analysis will also be performed.  The hazard 
ratio estimates and their 95% and 80% CIs will be generated usin g stratified and unstratified 
Cox proportional hazards models .  Rank- preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) method, 
as supportive/exploratory anal ysis for OS, will also be conducted.
9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
9.2.2.1. Progression -Free S urvival
PFS which i s defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first 
documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to an y cause, whichever 
is earlier.  
For patients who do not have objective tumor progression and who do not d ie 
while on study , PFS data will be censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment 
on study .  Patients lacking an evaluation of tumor response after randomization will have 
their PFS time censored on the date of randomization with duration of 1day. 
For each arm, estimates of the PFS curves from the Kaplan -
Meier method will be presented.  
Median PFS and 2 -sided 95% and 80% CI s for the medians will be provided using the 
Brookmey er-Crowley  method.  The PFS probabilities at4,6 and 12 months will be 
estimated.
Differences in PFS between treatment arms will be tested using the unstratified log -rank test.  
The hazard ratio estimates and their 95% and 80% CIs will be generated using unstratified 
Cox proportional hazards models .

Page 889.2.2.2. Objective Response
Objective response (OR) is defined as a CR or PR according to RECIST v. 1.1.  
Confirmation of the response is required.  The ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a CR or PR.  Patients who die, progress, or drop out for any reason after randomization prior to documented response will be included in the analysis as non-responders.
ORR on each treatment arm will be estimated with exact 2-sided 95% and 80% CIs.  
Treatment effects in terms of risk ratio will be tested using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with the same stratification factors as for the OS analysis.  Ninety-five percent and 80% CIs will also be provided. 
9.2.2.3. Duration of Response
DR will be analyzed for patients who achieve a best overall response of CR or PR per 
RECIST v. 1.1.  DR is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier.  The same censoring rules for PFS will be applied to DR. 
For each arm, estimates of the DR curves from the Kaplan-Meier method will be presented.  
Median DR times and 2-sided 95% and 80% CIs for the medians will be provided using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method.

9.3.2.1. Biomarker Analysis Set
The biomarker analysis set is defined as all patients treated with cetuximab in combination 
with placebo or palbociclib who have at least one baseline biomarker assessment.  Analysis sets will be defined separately for , archival tumor tissue  
 
9.3.2.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarker Endpoints
Biomarkers will be assessed separately , archival tumor tissue  
  In each case, summaries of baseline levels, changes from baseline (where 
appropriate), expression and mutation will be reported.  For continuous variables, summary statistics may include the mean, ratio to baseline, standard deviation, 25
thmedian, and 
75thquartile, % CV, and minimum/maximum levels of biomarker measures; for categorical 
variables, summary may include number and percentage, odds ratio as appropriate. 
 
 
 
 
9.3.3. Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)
Health-Related Quality of life and Head and Neck scores and change from baseline scores 
will be compared between the treatment arms using a mixed model repeated measures approach adjusting for specified covariates.  In addition, analyses will be performed to determine if the change from baseline scores achieve the appropriate minimally important difference (MID) cut-off for the scale being examined. 
In addition to the above analyses, an examination of the time to deterioration (TTD) 
composite endpoint will be carried out using survival analysis methods.  A composite 
definition for deterioration based on death, tumor progression, and/or SCCHN
cancer-specific quality of life subscale MIDs may be used.CCI CCI

Page 909.4.Safety Analysis
All patients who receive any study  treatment will be included in the final summaries and 
listings of safety  data.  In addition, the relationship between exposure and efficacy  and safety  
endpoints will be explored, as necessary , based on emerging efficacy  and safet y data.  Refer 
toSAP for details of the anal yses.The results of these modeling anal yses may  be reported 
separately  from the clinical study  report.
9.4.1. Adverse E vents
Frequencies of patients experiencing at least 1 AE will be summarized by  system organ class 
(SOC) and prefer red term according to MedDRA terminology .  The number and percent of 
patients with AE will be tabulated b y treatment and by cycle. 
Detailed information collected for each AE will include: a description of the event; duration; 
whether the AE was serious; i ntensity  (severit y) of event; relationship to study drug; action 
taken; and clinical outcome.  I ntensity  (severit y) of the AEs will be graded according to NCI 
CTCAE version 4.0 3. 
AEs leading to death or discontinuation of treatment, classified as Grade 3, or drug related, 
and SAEs will be considered with special attention.
9.4.2. Laboratory Abnormalities
Hematology  and chemistry  laboratory  data will be summarized by  treatment and by  cycle.  
The laboratory  results will be graded according to the NCI  CTCAE v4.0
3 severit y grade.  
The frequencies of the worst severit y grade observed will be displayed b y study  treatment.  
Shift tables will be provided to examine the distribution of laboratory  toxicities.  For 
parameters for which an NCI  CTCAE v4.03 scale does not exis t, the frequency  of patients 
with values below, within, and above the normal ranges will be summarized by  treatment .
9.4.3. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
For the anal ysis of ECG data, the triplicate data will be averaged and all summary  statistics 
and data presentation s will use the triplicate averaged data.  Any  data obtained from ECGs 
repeated for safet y reasons after the nominal time -points will not be averaged along with the 
preceding triplicates.
For all patients in the safety  anal ysis set, individual changes in QT c (QTcF , QTcB and 
QTcS) will be calculated for each nominal post- baseline time point and summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  Categorical anal ysis of the QTc data will be performed as follows:
The number and percentage of patients with maximum increas
e from baseline in QTc 
(<30, 30- 60, and  60msec).
The number of and percentage patients with maximum post- dose QTc 
(<450, 450-<480, 480 -<500, and >500 msec).

9.5. Interim Analysis
An interim anal ysis will be performed when at least 50% of the required number of events
(40deaths) is observed. The purpose of this interim analy sis is to stop the study  early for
futili ty.  The formal futility  boundary  will be constructed using the Gamma family  of 
spending function with parameter = 
0.05.  With 40 observed events at the interim anal ysis, 
the futilit y boundary  is p- value = 0.36 (corresponding to HR = 0.9) . The boundary  atfinal 
analysis is p-vlaue = 0.1.
9.6.Data Monitoring Committee 
This study  will use an E-DMC . 
The E- DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy  and safet y of patients 
in the study  according to the Charter. The E -DMC will make recommendati on as to whether 
or not the trial should continue based on ongoing reviews of safet y data.  In addition, the 
E-DMC will also evaluate interim efficacy data and make a recommendation regarding study  
continuation based on observed results of the study. The recommendations made b y the 
E-DMC to alter the conduct of the study  will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision.  Pfizer 
will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analy ses of endpoint 
events and of safet y data that are not en dpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate .  The 
sponsor will designate a biostatistician not affiliated with the project to prepare data for 
E
-DMC review.  Only  if action or consultation with Health Authorities is required will other 
sponsor staff be involved.  Clinical sites will be restricted from access to study  results until 
the conclusion of the study .
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study  conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the prot ocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs areaccurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be patient to review b y the IR B/EC, and/or to quality  assurance audits 
performed b y Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection 
by appropriate regulatory authorities.

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 92It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RECO RD KEEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this s tudy.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient .  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or approp riate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y
,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring , and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  the investigator or by  an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs are true. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the ph ysician's patient chart.  In 
these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be av ailable at the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorit ies or Pfizer, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating patient s (sufficient 
information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH), according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA) , 
whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  Pfizer. 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 93Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 y ears after completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patient s.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Hels inki (World 
Medical Association 1996 & 2008). 
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protoc ol, the ICHguideline 
on GCP , and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names 
or other identifiable data in any reports, p
ublications, or other disclosures, except where
required b y law.
When study  data is compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, patient
name s, address es, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code consisting 
of a nu mbering s ystem provided by  Pfizer in order to de -identify  study patients. The study  
site will maintain a confidential list of patient s who participated in the study  linking their 
numerical code to the patient’s actual identity .  In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain 
high standards of confidentiality  and protection of patient personal data consistent with 
applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document smust be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements , including applicable privacy  laws .

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 94The informed consent document s used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed b y the sponsor, approved b y the IRB/EC before use , and available for inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  patient,or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative ,is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from a patient
’s legally  acceptable representative, the patient ’s 
assent ( affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the 
capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  the IRB/EC.  If the investigator determines that 
a patient ’s decisional capacity  is so limited he/she cannot reasona bly be cons ulted, as 
permitted by  the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, then 
the patient ’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y patient does not provide his/he r own consent, the source documents
must record why the patient did not provide consent ( eg, minor, decisionally  impaired adult), 
how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient ’s legal ly 
acceptable representative, the c onsent signer’s relat ionship to the study  patient (eg, parent, 
spouse) and that the patient
’s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y it 
must be documented in the source documents.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the inv estigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient or the patient 's legally  acceptable representative before an y 
study -specific activity  is performed , unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by  
an IRB/EC . The investigator will retain the original of each patient 's signed consent 
document .
12.4. Patient Recruitment
Advertiseme nts approved by  ECs and investigator databases may  be used as recruitment 
procedures. 
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed ( ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks o f the investigational 
product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study patient s against any  immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that a sufficient number of patient s have been recruited and completed the study  as 
stated in the regulatory  application ( ie, clinical trial application [CTA ]) and ethics application 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 95in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated numbe r in the 
CTA) by  a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a 
normal conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in A ll Other Participating Countries
End of t rial in all other participating countries is define d aslast patient last visit (L PLV).
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/EC, drug safety  problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer.  I n 
addit ion, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of palbociclib at any  time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly  notify  the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and 
the hospital pharmacy  (if applicable) withi n one week of notification.  As directed b y Pfizer, 
all study  materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.
15.PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS
15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer
Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the 
results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov) ,the European Clinical Trials 
Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com , and other publ ic registries in accordance with 
applicable local laws/regulations. 
In all cases, stud y results are reported b y Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and 
complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the stud y or the country in 
which the study  was conducted.
www.clinicaltrials.gov
Pfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer -sponsored

that could be used to ident ify individual patients has been removed) on www.pfizer.com for 
Pfizer -sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is 
posted to on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
15.2. Publications by Investigators
Pfizer has no objection to publication by  an investigator of any  information collected or 
generated b y the investigator, whether or not the results are favorable to the i
nvestigational 
drug. However, to ensure aga inst inadvertent disclosure of confidential i nformation or 
unprotected 
invent ions, the investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity  to review an y 
proposed publication or other ty pe of disclosure before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed.
The i nvestigator will provide manuscripts, abstracts, or the full text of any  other inte nded 
disclosure (poster presentation, invited speaker or guest lecturer presentation, etc.) to Pfizer 
at least 30 days before they  are submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If any 
patent action is required to protect intellectual property righ ts, the investigator agrees to delay  
the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days.
The i nvestigator will, on request, remove an y previously  undisclosed confidential 
information (other than the study results themselves) before disclosure.
If the study  is part of a multi centerstudy , the investigator agrees that the first publication is 
to be a joint publication covering all centers. However, if a joint manuscript has not been 
submitted for publication within 12 months of co mpletion or ter
mination of the study  at all 
participating sites, the investigator is free to publish separatel y, patient to the other 
requirements of this s ection.
For all publications relating to the 
study, the i nstitution will comply  with recognized ethical 
standards c oncerning publications and authorship, including Section II -“Ethical 
Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for

CATEGORIZING LESIONS AT BA SELINE
Measurable Lesions 
Lesions that can be accurately  measured in at least one dimension.
Lesions with longest diameter twice the slice thickness and at least 10 mm or greater 
when assessed b y CT or MRI  (slice thickness 5
-8 mm).
Lesions with longest di ameter at least 20 mm when assessed b y Chest X -ray. 
Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by caliper.
Malignant ly mph nodes with the short axis 15 mm or greater when assessed by  CT.
NOTE: The shortest axis is used as th e diameter for malignant ly mph nodes, longest axis for 
all other measurable lesions. 
Non-measurable disease 
Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be considered measurable (including 
nodes with short axis between 10 and 14.9 mm) and truly  non- measurable disease such as 
pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, clinical lesions that cannot be accurately  measured 
with calipers, abdominal masses iden tified b y physical examination that are not measurable 
by reproducible imaging techniques.
Bone disease: Bone disease is non
-measurable with the exception of soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated b y CT or MRI and meet the definition of 
measurability at baseline. 
Previous local treatment: A previously  irradiated lesion (or lesion subjected to other 
local treatment) is non -measurable unless it has progressed since completion of 
treatment.
Normal sites
Cystic lesions: Simple cysts should not be conside red as malignant lesions and should 
not be recorded either as target or non- target disease.  Cy stic lesions thought to 
represent cy stic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they  meet the specific 
definition above.  If non -cystic lesions are also presen t, these are preferred as target 
lesions.

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 104Normal nodes: Nodes with short axis <10 mm are considered normal and should not 
be recorded or followed either as measurable or non- measurable disease.
Recording Tumor Assessments 
All sites of disease must be asse ssed at baseline.  Baseline assessments should be done as 
close as possible prior to study  start.  For an adequate baseline assessment, all required scans 
must be done within 28 days prior to treatment and all disease must be documented 
appropriatel y.  If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generall y should be 
indeterminate. 
Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as targ et lesions at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability  for 
accurate repeated measurements.  Record the longest diameter for each lesion, except in the 
case of pathological l ymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded.  The sum of 
the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions 
at baseline will be the basis for comparison to assessments performed on study . 
If two target lesions coalesce t he measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a 
large target lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used.
Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded.  If 
a target lesion becomes too small to measure, 0 mm should be recorded if the lesion is 
considered to have disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm should be 
recorded.
NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurement should 
still be recorded.
Non-target disease 
All non- measurable disease is non -target.  All measurable lesions not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non -target disease.  Measurements are not required but rather 
assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMI NATE, PRESENT/NOT 
INCREASED, INCREASED.  Mul tiple non- target lesions in one organ may  be recorded as a 
single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic l ymph nodes’ or ‘multiple 
liver metastases’).
OBJECTIVE RESPONSE STATUS AT EACH EVALUATION
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent 
administration of contrast and timing of scanning.  If a change needs to be made the case 
must be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution is possible.  If not, 
subsequent objective stat
uses are indeterminate.

Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 105Target disease
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the 
exception of nodal disease.  All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis 
< 10 mm).  All target lesions must be assessed.
Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions.  The short diameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target 
lesions.  All target lesions must be assessed. 
Stable: Does not qualify  for CR, PR or Progression.  All target lesions must be 
assessed.  Stable can follow PR only  in the rare case that the sum increases by  less 
than 20% from the nadir, but enough that a p reviously  documented 30% decrease no 
longer holds. 
Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in 
the sum is observed during therap y), with a m inimum absolute increase of 5 mm. 
Indeterminate.  Progression has not been documented, and 
one or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed, 
or assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at baseline,
or one or more target lesi ons cannot be measured accuratel y (eg, poorl y visible 
unless due to being too small to measure),
or one or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared 
or increased. 
Non-target disease
CR: Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
levels.  All ly mph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of an y non -target lesions and/or tumor marker level 
above the normal limits. 
PD: Unequivocal progression of pre- existing le sions.  Generally  the overall tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently  to merit discontinuation of therapy .  In the presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non- target 
disease should be rare. 

Palbociclib (PD -0332991)
A5481044
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 31 March 2016
Page 106Indeterminate: Progres sion has not been determined and one or more non -target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at 
baseline.
New Lesions 
The appearance of an y new unequivocal malignant lesion indicates PD.  If a new lesion is 
equivocal, for example due to its small size, continued assessment will clarify  the etiology .  
If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression should be recorded on the date of 
the initial assessment.  A lesion identified in an area not previously sc anned will be 
considered a new lesion.
Supplemental Investigations
If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased in size but did not 
disappear completel y, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with 
biopsy  or fine needle as pirate.  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.
If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increase possibly due to 
necrosis, the lesion may  be investigated with biopsy  or fine needle aspirate to clarify  
status. 
Subjective progression
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CRFs.  This should be 
indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deteriorat ion of Health 
Status.  Every  effort should be made to document objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

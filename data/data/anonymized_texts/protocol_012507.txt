*** Confidential  *** 1.0 Introduction and Background 
In September 2016, the Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel’s report highlighted excessive mortality 
from colorectal cancer (CRC), the problems of health disparities, the need for interventions that inform 
patients of CRC screening tests, and the need for research to rapidly translate evidence- based CRC 
screening interventions into practice.1  This study  directly addresses all four of these Cancer Moonshot 
priorities by examining  the implementation of an innovative mobile health (mHealth) CRC screening 
intervention that is accessible by members of health- disparate populations.  Lessons learned from this 
study will inform the scale- up of this CRC screening intervention, as well as the implementation of other 
mHealth interventions.  
Screening for CRC is widely recommended but underused. CRC screening tests are cost -effective, and 
they reduce both CRC mortality and incidence by detecting and removing pre- cancerous polyps.2–5  
Regular screening for CRC beginning at age 50 is widely recommended by several groups, including the United States Preventive Services Task Force.
6–9 Nonetheless, over 35% of Americans are 
unscreened.10   
Screening rates are even lower among underserved populations, contributing to health disparities.10,11 
Those with less education, limited income, or rural residences are less likely to be screened, and thus 
more likely to present with advanced- stage CRC and die from it.12–16 Limited health literacy, which 
affects over 33% of American adults further interfering with patients’ ability to access, interpret, and apply health information to their care.
17–21  
Barriers to CRC screening include patient factors (lack of knowledge, low self -efficacy, fears, negative 
attitudes)22–28 and provider/system factors (lack of time, failure to offer screening options, lack of patient 
support).29–33 Meaningful increases in CRC screening will require an easily implemented intervention 
that addresses patient, provider, and system barriers while also being accessible to low income and low literacy individuals.
34,35 We created our mPATH -CRC (mobile PAtient Technology for Health -Colorectal 
Cancer) intervention to tackle  these needs.  
mPATH -CRC is our iPad -based application, designed for individuals with low literacy, which patients 
use during routine health care visits.36 Because most Americans over age 50 have seen a doctor within 
the past year, including 75% of adults with less than a high school education, interventions in medical practices have a potential broad reach.
37 mPATH -CRC also sends automated text messages to help 
patients complete their screening tests, which extends support  beyond the medical encounter.  95% of 
US adults own a cellphone, and there is no digital divide along racial or socioeconomic lines, which creates an opportunity to encourage healthy behaviors and potentially reduce health disparities.
38–41 
Our mPATH -CRC intervention leverages the high prevalence of medical encounters and cellphone 
ownership to maximize its reach.  
While several tests exist for CRC screening, most clinicians encourage colonoscopy, the most invasive 
and costly option.33,42  Because CRC screening rates are higher when patients can choose fecal occult 
blood testing, there is a critical need for interventions to help patients decide which test they prefer.11,43  
Our mPATH -CRC program uses a validated decision aid to inform patients of the commonly used 
screening tests and help them select their best option,44 a direct recommendation of the Cancer 
Moonshot Implementation Science Working Group Report.1  In our previous randomized, controlled 
efficacy trial of 450 patients, mPATH -CRC more than doubled CRC screening rates (30% vs 15%, 
p=0.0001).45 This efficacy trial demonstrated the potential for mPATH -CRC to improve screening rates,

*** Confidential  *** but the implementation was led by our research team, thereby restricting its potential for scale- up in a 
real-world context. This major gap is now addressed in this planned Type III hybrid implementation trial.  
Translating mPATH -CRC into widespread use could increase receipt of CRC screening in the US from 
its current low level of 58% to over 70%, the target set by Healthy People 2020.46,47 However, the 
optimal strategies for implementing mHealth interventions in clinical care remain unknown. Three 
recently published reviews identified over 500 articles and conference proceedings on mHealth studies, 
none of which prospectively examined competing implementation strategies.48–50  Accordingly, this 
study will impact public health in two key ways: implementing mPATH -CRC in community practices to 
decrease CRC mortality, and determining the best strategies for implementing and sustaining the 
growing number of other mHealth interventions that currently lack an evidence base for implementation.  
2.0 Objectives 
2.1 Primary Objective  
2.1.1  In a cluster -randomized controlled trial of 22 primary care clinics, compare 
the implementation outcomes of a “high touch” evidence- based mHealth 
implementation strategy with a “low touch” implementation strategy.   We 
will first refine the “high touch” strategy based on input from focus groups with stakeholders.  We will then rigorously evaluate the strategy in sites with different geographic settings (urban, suburban, and rural), clinic structures, and patient 
populations served.  Our primary implementation outcome will be the proportion 
of all pa tients who complete mPATH -CRC in the 6
th month following the  
implementation date.  Secondary outcomes will include Reach, Adoption, 
Maintenance, and Fidelity.  Additional secondary outcomes include Acceptability, 
Appropriateness, and Feasibility.   We will also measure implementation costs to 
estimate the cost per patient reached  as an exploratory outcome. 
2.2 Secondary Objective 
2.2.2  In a pragmatic trial, e stimate the effect of mPATH -CRC on completion of 
CRC screening within 16 weeks of visit.  We will query the electronic health 
record (EHR) at each study clinic to identify individuals aged 50 – 74 with no 
evidence of current CRC screening at the time of their clinic visit. We will then examine in the EHR whether these individuals complete CRC screening within 
16 weeks of their index visit. The primary effectiveness analysis will compare the 
proportion of patients who complete screening between the pre - and post -
implementation period in the “high touch” vs. “low touch” clinics. A secondary analysis will explore whether there is a dose -response relationship between use 
of mPATH -CRC and screening rates across all clinics.   
2.2.3  Det
ermine the factors that facilitate or impede the maintenance of mHealth 
interventions like mPATH -CRC.  We will assess all clinics 12 months after 
implementation to identify those with high, low, and variable levels of 
maintenance.  Using mixed methods that incorporate in- depth interviews with 
clinic staff, providers, and administrators, we will identify theory -based and 
organizational factors associated with sustained use of technology -based

guide future large -scale dissemination and implementation trials. 
3.0 Study Population 
This study will include three distinct populations of participants: 1) healthcare providers and staff  at 
primary care practi ces, and 2) all adult patients  seen in the participating study sites 3) all adult patients 
seen in the participating study sites who are deemed eligible for CRC screening . Providers and staff will 
participate through focus groups, survey s, and interviews. The provider/staff inclusion criteria vary 
according to the phase of the study. Therefore, for simplicity, the provider/staff inclusion c riteria are 
described with the experimental methods  for the relevant study activity  (Section 4.0). The patient 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed below. 
3.1 Patient Inclusion Criteria: All Patients  
3.1.1. Age 18 and older  
3.1.2. Spanish or English -speaking  
3.1.3. Have appointment scheduled with provider (Physician, PA, or NP) at 
participating study site  
3.2 Pati
ent Inclusion Criteria : CRC Screening Portion 
3.2.1.  Have appointment scheduled with provider (Physician, PA, or NP) at participating 
study site  
3.2.2.  Age 50 – 74  
3.2.3.  Spanish or English -speaking  
3.2.4.  Due for routine CRC screening, defined as:  
•No colonoscopy within the prior 10 years
•No flexible sigmoidoscopy within the prior 5 years
•No CT colonography within the prior 5 years
•No fecal DNA testing within the prior 3 years
•No fecal blood testing (guaiac -based test with home kit or fecal
immunochemical test) within the prior 12 months
3.3 Inclusion of Women and M inorities  
3.3.1  Women and men of all races and ethnicity who meet the above- described 
eligibility criteria  are eligible for this trial. 
3.3.2  Patient s will be participating in a pragmatic trial that will include Spanish and 
English -speaking adult patients who are seen in community -based primary care 
practices in North Carolina. Therefore, the study sample demographics will 
reflect the demographics of the clinics’ population.  We will query the electronic 
health records to obtain data for all age and language eligible patients seen in 
the 22 study clinics over a 24- month  period. Therefore, we are unable to es timate 
a precise sample, but we estimate this pragmatic trial will include a minimum 30,000 patients.  Based on the clinics’ population estimates, we expect 
approximately 55% of participants to be women. Similarly, we expect

Black/African -American, 1% to be Asian, and < 1% to be American Indian/Alaska 
Native.  
3.4 Registration Procedures  
Patients will be participating in a pragmatic trial  in which patient data collection will occur 
by retrospective electronic chart review. All patients will receive current guideline-
recommended care, and we will request a waiver of patient Informed Consent. 
Therefore, it is impractical to register patients with the Cancer Center, and any such 
registration would jeopardize patient confidentiality.  
Clini
c staff and providers will participate in surveys, interviews, and/or focus groups. No 
sensitive information will be collected from clinic staff or providers. Therefore, we are 
requesting a waiver of signed cons ent. W e will give all participating staff and providers a 
study information sheet explaining the purpose of the study, the nature of the data to be collect ed, and the voluntary nature of their participation.  
4.0 Experimental Methods 
Using a Type 3 hybrid implementation -effectiveness design, we will evaluate a theory -based “high 
touch” implementation strategy compared to a “low touch” implementation strategy for incorporating 
mPATH -CRC in routine practice in 22 geographically diverse primary care practices . The study will 
include an implementation trial (to compare the implementation outcomes of both strategies ), a 
pragmatic trial (to e stimate the effect of mPATH -CRC on completion of CRC screening), and a mixed-
methods study (to determine the factors that facilitate or impede the maintenance of technology -based 
interventions ).   
4.1 The mPATH Intervention 
mPATH is a self -administered iPad program that patients use in primary care clinics to help 
them receive CRC screening.  The mPATH  program also includes health questions to assist

*** Confidential  *** clinics with patient check -in, thereby incentivizing its use for all patients. Clinic staff hand the 
mPATH -Check In program to patients upon check -in so that they may use it immediately be fore 
their medical visit.  To overcome literacy and usability barriers  each question is written in simple 
lay language.  One question is displayed per screen, with large intuitive response buttons 
(Figure 1).  The mPATH -CheckIn  program determines patients ’ screening status (due, possibly 
due, or current) by asking patients three items about their screening history and by connecting 
with the EPIC electronic health record.  
If patients are due for CRC screening, mPATH -CRC displays an 8 -minute previously -valida ted 
CRC screening decision aid that includes graphics, animations, and video testimonials from 
patients and physicians, consistent with Social Cognitive Theory.51,52  mPATH informs patients 
of the benefits and risks of screening (including costs and complications) and lets them “self -
order” either of the two most commonly recommended tests (fecal occult blood testing and 
colonoscopy).9,44  Self -ordered tests are automatically routed to the patient’s primar y care 
provider for approval, allowing providers to overrule an order in the rare case it is felt inappropriate.   
mPATH tells patients with specific risk factors (such as family history of CRC) to discuss screening with their provider, since screening gui delines differ for these high- risk individuals.
6,8 
When patients are done using mPATH, a clinic  staff member collects the iPad. 
mPATH  checks its usage database on startup and only ascertains patients’ screening status if 
the patient has not completed the CRC questions in the prior 6 months, an approach validated 
by Miller in a prior study of a substance abuse screening system in primary care practices.54  
mPATH automatically sends data  wirelessly to a central server and deletes the data once 
transmission confirmation is received, thereby preventing any data loss.  Although all currently 
interested clinics have wireless networks, any clinic without an existing wireless network will be 
given a wireless router. All clinics can access their data and generate customized reports via a 
secure web interface.  
mPATH runs outside the EHR but directly receives and sends data to EPIC -based EHRs, a 
commonly used EHR in the US55 and the platform used by all Wake Forest -affiliated practices. 
4.2 Framework for Implementing mPATH  
Our strategy for implementing mPATH is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to 
guide initial implementation and the Dynamic Sustainability Framework to guide maintenance, 
or continued use over time.  The TAM posits that implementation of a new technology is 
determined by social influences and characteristics of the technology (which determine its perceived usefulness ) and employees’ characteristics and experiences (which determine its 
perceived ease of use ).
56–58  After implementation, the Dynamic Sustainability Framework 
incorporates adaptability  of mPATH as a means to promote maintenance.  
Our “high touch” implementation strategy leverages evidence- based implementation strategies 
in conjunction with these two models ( Figure 2 ).  Each clinic will have a clinic champion who will 
guide implementation and contribute to the Social Influence construct of the TAM.  The research 
team will provide facilitation through a pre -implementation meeting with the clinic champion, an 
on-site kick -off training session, and regular follow -up phone conferences with the champion.59  
During the follow -up phone conferences, topics known to promote implementation and 
sustainability will be discussed, including reviewing quality assurance reports, identifying 
performance gaps, and brainstorming barriers.59–63  Clinics can also use a reporting function in 
mPATH to generate custom reports of data collected and receive “real time” feedback. We

*** Confidential  *** expect that these features, and adaptations to mPATH to meet check -in needs, will increase the 
perceived usefulness of the program.  Training and support through a hands -on kick -off session, 
follow -up technical assistance, and repeated trainings as needed will increase staff self -efficacy, 
perceptions of control, and usability.60,64 Altogether, these multiple activities will increase intent 
to use mPATH, use of mPATH, and sustained use of mPATH.  We will measur e the key 
constructs of these models to determine their impact on implementation and maintenance 
(Section 5.0) .
4.3 Pilot -Testing Implementation Strategy and Materials  
4.3.1 . Focus Groups and Interviews  
A formative evaluation of our implementation strategy65 will include a  review of the strategy and 
training materials with four focus groups  and individual semi -structured interviews.  Each focus 
group will include six to 10 clinic staff who are involved with checking in and rooming patients, 
such as front desk staff, medical  assistants, and nurses. Two focus groups will be recruited from 
clinics that participated in the randomized- controlled efficacy trial of mPATH (R01CA178941), 
and the other two from primary care clinics new to mPATH -CRC.  A trained moderator will use a 
moderator’s  guide (Appendix A.3) to explore the facilitators and barriers to implementation, 
strategies for minimizing barriers, the adequacy of draft training plans , and additional support or 
training materials desired.   
A trained interviewer will also conduct individual semi -structured interviews with two providers 
(doctors or advanced practice professionals) and one administrator at each of the four clinics, 
for a total of 12 interviews. Interviews will be conducted using an interview guide ( Appendix 
Figure 2.  mPATH -CRC Implementation Theoretical Model and Strategies.

materials) according to what is most convenient for the interviewee.
All focus group and interview participants will complete a brief demographic survey  that incl udes 
items assessing attitudes about technology  (Appendix A.5) which will help the research team 
interpret their responses.  
Focus groups and interviews will be audio recorded and the content summarized. Each 
participant will receive a $50 gift card . Revisions to the implementation strategy and materials 
will be informed by the focus group  and interview  results .  
4.3.2 . Pilot Testing Training Materials , Surveys,  and the mPATH Program  
We will pilot test our training materials , surveys,  and the mPATH program with two primary care 
clinics in the Wake Forest Baptist Health network. Each clinic will receive the kick -off training 
described in Section 4.4.1. Following the kick -off training session, we will ask clinic staff to 
complete the sta ff baseline survey described in Section 4.4.4.6. We will then let each clinic use 
the mPATH program. After six months, we will ask clinic staff to complete the follow -up survey 
described in Section 4.4.4.6  
4.4  Implementation 
Trial  
 In a randomized- controlled 
cluster study of 22  primary 
care clinics, we will 
compare the 
implementation outcomes 
(as defined by the RE -AIM 
framework)66 and 
implementation costs of the “high touch” strategy to a 
“low touch” strategy.  The 
components of each strategy and their timing are outlined in Table 1. 
 4.4.1. “High Touch” 
Implementation Strategy  
The “high touch” strategy consists of pre -
implementati on activities, 
training, and ongoing support.  
Pre-implementation activities.   At each site, we will identify a clinic champion who will guide the 
local implementation effort.  Champions typically arise through self or peer- nomination.
67 This 
person typically plays a central role in implementing new systems and has a demonstrated 
ability to  communicate effectively, navigate the organizational environment, promote a project, 
and work well with others.67,68 We will identify the champion by asking clinic administrators, lead 
nurses, and lead physicians who meets these qualities and would be will ing to serve in this role.  
Each champion will then help the team identify a  nursing super -user and a front desk super -Table 1.  Comparison of Implementation

*** Confidential  *** user. Lastly, each clinic will identify an alternate champion to assist with implementation and 
provide continuity if the champion is unavailable due to vacation or illness.  The alternate 
champion may be one of the super -users . We designed mPATH for use by patients before 
medical visits, but the timing and location of use can vary. However,  each clinic may adjust the 
implementation to meet their unique needs.   
 Kick-off training session.   Two members of the study team will visit each practice to conduct a 
training session for clinic staff identified by the local clinic champion.  This training will incl ude 
hands -on practice with mPATH, including scenarios where patients “self -order” tests, to 
increase staff’s comfort with the program, increase their self -efficacy, and demonstrate its 
usability.   
A separate brief training session will be held for the clinic providers. The provider training will 
include an overview of the mPATH program and its functionality. Because providers will not directly interact with the mPATH program, the provider training will not include hands -on 
practice scenarios.  
 At-elbow support.  The study team will provide at -elbow technical support the day the clinic 
launches mPATH in their practice.  
On-Going Support:  The study team will conduct a conference call with the clinic champion and 
alternate  2-3 business days after the launch date, and then  at weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 post -
launch to discuss the clinic’s exp eriences with mPATH, review QA reports generated from 
mPATH data (frequency of use, patient demographics), explore the need for  adaptations, and 
provide support. If program usage is below goal levels, barriers will be reviewed with the clinic champion and additional on- site training offered. Clinics may request technical support and 
additional training at any time, and clinics can self -generate reports to self -monitor mPATH -CRC 
implementation.  
4.4.2 .  “Low Touch” Implementation Strategy  
Clinics randomized to receive the low 
touch 
implementation 
strategy will 
receive: 1) the 
initial kick -off on -
site training session and implementation materials (identical 
to the “high touch” 
group), and 2) 
access to 
phone/email technical support 
as requested.  No 
adaptations will be 
made to the mPATH program for “low touch” clinics, nor will study staff proactively reach out to them after the kick -off training session.  Table 2.   Ch aracteristics of study clinics   3.   Characteristics of study clinics

*** Confidential  ***  4.4.3. Study Sites 
 We will conduct the trial in community -based primary care practices in North Carolina, chosen 
to reflect diversity in geography and populations served.  Practices will be affiliated with the 
Wake Forest Health Network  (Table 2). Pilot data from target  clinic systems show  significant 
diversity in terms of payer mix (7% -10% Medicaid vs 48%) and racial diversity (76% -83% white).  
To increase racial diversity further, we will selectively enroll clinics with greater diversity. 
Counties where the clinics are located range from rural to urban.  No currently identified clinics 
use tablet devices with patients, and we will exclude any additional clinics that already use 
tablets.  Each potential study clinic will complete a baseline clinic overview questionnaire 
(Appendix B). Data from this questionnaire will be used to construct our final study clinic 
sample.  All clinics will receive at least one study iPad (preloaded with mPATH) per full -time 
equivalent clinician.  All clinics will keep the study iPads  at the end of the study, encouraging 
participation.  
 4.4.4. Study Cohort  
mPATH is designed to be given to all English  or Spanish- speaking patients on clinic check -in.  
Therefore, our implementation outcomes cohort will include all adult (18 and over) Engl ish or 
Spanish- speaking patients who are seen in the study clinics  in the 12 months following the initial 
clinic mPATH launch date.  Our effectiveness outcome will include all English or Spanish 
speaking patients aged 50- 74 who are eligible for CRC screening based on EHR records in the 
12 months prior to and 12 months following the initial clinic mPATH launch date. We can 
capture all data needed for this cohort because all the clinics have searchable electronic health 
records.  
4.4.5. Implementation and Clinic Randomization  
We will randomly implement mPATH -CRC in 2 clinics (1 “high touch” and 1 “low touch”) until all 
22 clinics are enrolled. To control for major organizational differences that could impact 
implementation, we will first select 2 clinics of  similar size, then randomly assign one to receive 
the “high touch” strategy and the other the “low touch” strategy.   
4.4.6. Data Collection  
Baseline clinic  personnel  survey  (Appendix B) :  At the initial kick -off training visit, w e will 
administer a basel ine survey to all clinic personnel (e.g., administrators, nurses, providers) who 
are involved with the implementation of  mPATH -CRC, as identified by the local clinic 
champions. All surveys will assess constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model and the 
Dynamic Sustainability Framework.56,69 Clinic personnel who do not complete the baseline 
survey (i.e., new hires) will complete it with their first follow -up survey  (described below).   
Follow -up clinic personnel  survey (Appendix B): Because clinic environments and experience 
with the mPATH system will evolve over time, we will administer a follow -up survey 6 months 
and 12 months after the initial on- site training.  I f a clinic site decides to stop using the mPATH 
program prior to a scheduled follow -up survey, one final follow -up survey will be administered 
within 6 weeks of the practice discontinuing use of mPATH. The follow -up survey will assess 
organizational characteristics, individual characteristics, and experience with the mPATH -CRC 
system. Each person will receive a $10 incentive for each survey completed.   
Clinic Contact and Cost Database (Appendix B):   All study team contact with the clinics, and all 
technology costs associated with implementing and maintaining mPATH will be recorded in a 
secure, electronic database. Data will include date of contact, mode of contact (i.e., in- person,

*** Confidential  *** phone, email), person initiating contact, purpose of contact, and the roles of staff involved in the 
contact.  These data will allow us to compare the cost of the “high touch” and “low touch” 
intervention strategies and associations between the amount of support given and specific 
implementation outcomes.  
4.5 Pragmatic Trial  
To determine mPATH -CRC’s effectiveness, we will nest a pragmatic trial within the 
implementation study.  We will query the electronic health record (EHR) at each study clinic to 
identify unscreened individual s aged 50 – 74 who completed a clinic visit with a physician or 
advanced practice professional  4 to 12 months prior to the implementation launch date, and 0 to 
8 months after the implementation kick -off launch date .  Specific inclusion criteria are detailed in 
Section 3.0.  We will then examine in the EHR whether these individuals complete CRC 
screening within 16 weeks of their index visit.   
4.6 Mixed -Methods Study  
The mixed- methods study will examine the f acilitators and barriers to maintenance (sustained 
use o f mPATH -CRC over time). In the 12th month after each clinic’s launch date, we will identify 
sites who have maintained use of the mPATH program throughout the study period.  To 
supplement the quantitative data gathered with our clinic surveys  (Section 4.4.6) , we will 
conduct semi -structured interviews with four  members of each clinic:  the clinic champion, one 
clinician , one front desk team member, and one medical assistant/nursing team member. The 
clinic champion will assist in the identification of the other team members for interviews based on their experience with the mPATH program.  All participants will receive a $50 gift card.  Using 
an interview guide (Appendix C), we will explore how mPATH -CRC was incorporated in the 
clinic’s work flow and factors that  affected maintenance such as intervention adaptations, 
organizational characteristics, and the champion’s role. There will be a separate version of the interview guide for clinics who have very low (or no) usage of mPATH during their participation 
in the study .
56,69,70 Members of clinics that opt to discontinue use of mPATH will be interviewed 
as soon as practical after they discontinue use. We will interview representatives from study 
clinics until thematic saturation is reached.  These semi -structured interviews, expected to last 
approximately 30 minutes, will be conducted by phone or video conference and analyzed by 
staff trained in qualitative methods.  Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
Transcripts will be imported into ATLAS.ti software,71 iteratively reviewed, coded by concept, 
and analyzed thematically to describe the implementation and sustainability experience. 
Themes will be compared among clinics to determine any differences.  
5.0 Outcome Measures 
5.1 Def
inition of Time Points  
The Implementation Date will be defined as the date of the clinic launch  at each site. A 
“month” is defined as a 4 week time period.   “Week 1” commences the day of clinic 
launch.

*** Confidential  *** 6.0 Analytic Plan 
6.1  Samp
le Size and Power  
6.1.1 Primary outcome: Our primary objective is to assess differences in mPATH -CRC Reach 
proportion of participants who complete the mPATH -CRC program or have risk factors identified 
by mPATH -CheckIn) in the 6th month  between the two implementation strategies. Using 
formulae found in Hemming et al.,72 Table 3 shows the number of clinics necessary to detect 
differences in Reach  ranging from .1 5 to .20 with 80% and 90% power for intraclass correlations 
(ICC) ranging from .03 to .08, assuming an average sample size per clinic of 30 with a cluster 
sample size coefficient of variation (CV) of 25%.  These latter numbers are based on estimated 
numbers  of eligible patients seen monthly, obtained from a  
survey of the  
participating clinics.  Since 
these data will 
be obtained 
from the EHR, 
we will use all eligible patients at each site. We will recruit a total of 22 clinics, which will provide 
at least 80% power to detect a difference of 15% if the ICC is 0.0 3 or lower. If the ICC were as 
high as 0.08, we would have over 80% power to detect a difference of 20%. These calculations assume average utilization across all sites of 50%. Power increases as rates move away from 
50% in either direction.  
6.1.2 Effectiveness outcome:  A secondary objective is to assess the effect of mPATH -CRC on 
screening rates  (effectiveness)  comparing 8 months of data prior to implementation to 8 months 
of data following implementation. The detectable difference (difference in screening rates pre vs 
post) depends on the sample size, power, ICC, and cluster sample size CV .  We will assume a 
screening rate in the  pre-implementation group of 15%, as observed in the control group in our 
R01 study.
45 Using SS/Power  formulae for cluster designs72,73, Table 4 shows the differences  in 
screening rates we will be able to detect 
with 80% and 90% power for ICCs ranging from 0.03 to 0.06, assuming an 
average monthly sample size of 30 
patients per clinic in the EHR, a cluster 
sample size CV of 25% , and no change 
in the screening trends over time. Because of the diminishing return of cluster designs, 
additional patients have little effect on the detectable difference, although we will use all the 
patients in the EHR.  We see that we will be able to detect a 10% difference in screening rates 
(15% vs 25%)  with 80% power even if the ICC is as large as 0.04 . We estimate that a minimum 
of 30 patients per clinic per month will meet inclusion criteria for this analysis (based on age, 
language, and screening status) and will be available through the EHR, so we will be amply powered for assessing the secondary aim.    
To evaluate whether the effect of mPATH- CRC on screening rates differs by implementation 
strategy, the period (pre vs post) by strategy (“high touch” vs “low touch”) interaction can be 
evaluated. Based on the control group from the previous randomized- controlled efficacy study, 
we anticipate a screening rate of 15% for “low touch” and pre - implementation. An increase in  Table 3.  Total number of clinics needed to detect the specified difference in Reach as a

*** Confidential  *** the screening rate from 15% to 25% from pre to post, corresponds to an odds ratio (OR) of 3. 
Similarly, assuming a screening rate in the “low 
touch” group of 15%, and a screening rate of 25% in 
the “high touch” group, also corresponds to an OR of 
3. By design, we anticipate half of the patients being in the “high touch” group and half in the post period, 
and that strategy and period are independent. Based
on these assumptions, Table 5  shows the interaction OR that can be detected with 80% power
for ICCs ran ging from 0.03 to 0.06, assuming an average monthly sample size of 30 patients
per clinic in the EHR (for 8 months pre and 8 months post), a cluster sample size CV of 25%,
and no change in the screening trends over time.
6.2  Anal
ysis of Primary Outcome  
We will assess the primary hypothesis  (that the “high touch” vs. “low touch” implementation 
strategy will result in greater use of the intervention) using a mixed effects logistic regression 
model with mPATH -CRC Reach  (Y/N) as the individual -level outcome, implementation 
approach as the primary independent variable, site as a random effect, and the stratification 
factor  clinics size  as a covariate per the design.  A descriptive approach will also be utilized 
where mPAT H-CRC Reach is estimated and reported along with an exact 95% confidence 
interval for each month (for months 1- 6 following implementation), and within socioeconomic 
strata for “high touch” and “low touch” clinics separately.  In secondary analyses, we will assess 
effects of clinic -level covariates (e.g. volume, rurality, organizational culture) and patient level 
covariates (e.g. age, gender, race/ethnicity) on  Reach.  We will include arm -by-covariate 
interactions to determine if the effect of the implementation strategy differs depending on levels of the covariates.  This secondary analysis will allow us to determine effects of the 
implementation strategy in clinics with varying organizational factors and populations. The 
proposed approach allows us to incorporate participant - and cluster -level covariates, but there 
are other  analysis methods we could employ. For example, we could use a clinic -level analysis 
(e.g. analysis of covariance) on the mean implementation rates within each clinic, or another 
individual- level approach (e.g. generalized estimating equations). Alternative methods and their 
strengths and weaknesses  are well-documented.
74–76 These alternate approaches will be used 
in a sensitivity analysis to determine effect s of the modeling assumptions on the results.  
6.3 Analysis of Secondary Outcomes 
The key secondary outcome of effectiveness of mPATH -CRC will be evaluated by comparing 
the proportion who complete CRC screening within 16 weeks of their index visit to the clinic 
between a pre- implementation cohort (months 12 - 4 before implementation) and a post -
implementation cohort (months 1 - 8 after implementation). Similar to the model described for 
mPATH -CRC Reach above, effectiveness of mPATH -CRC will be evaluated using a mixed 
effects logistic regression model. For an overall assessment of the effectiveness, completing 
CRC screening within 16 weeks ( Y/N) will be the patient -level outcome, implementation cohort 
will be the primary independent variable, site will be a random effect, and the stratification factor clinic size will be a covariate per the design. Pre - vs post -implementation changes will also be 
compared between the “high touch” and “low touch” implementation strategies and between 
dose levels defined based on mPATH -CRC usage by incorporating interactions  into the mixed 
effects logistic regression models.  An interrupted time series analysis (segmented Table 5. Detectable interaction odds ratio

(using interaction terms with clinic within a linear model)  adjusting for any trend that was 
occurring in screening prior to the implementation.  This model provides estimates of the time 
trends before and after the intervention as well as the change in s creening rates due to the 
intervention. Linear contrasts will be used to compare the changes in screening rates and trends 
between the “high touch” clinics and the “low touch” clinics.  As in Section 6.2, we will assess the effects of cluster - and patient -level covariates and their interactions with implementation 
strategy in secondary analyses. The same basic approach outlined in Section 6.2 will also be used to compare other binary implementation outcomes between the “high touch” and “low 
touch” strategies. Continuous implementation outcomes are measured at the provider/staff 
level, rather than the patient level. Linear mixed effects models will be used to compare these 
outcomes between the “high touch” and “low touch” strategies, with implementation approach as the primary independent variable, site as a random effect, and the stratification factor clinic size 
as a covariate per the design.

Clinic survey data will be stored in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system, a web-
based application for building and managing online surveys and databases. REDCap was developed in the CTSA network and implemented at Wake Forest specifically around HIPAA security guidelines. 
REDCap provides an intuitive interface for users to enter data, has real -time validation rules at the time 
of entry, and maintains audit trails.  
All ex
tracted clinical datasets and datasets containing data from combined sources will be stored on a 
central Wake Forest data server using industry standard encryption (e.g., AES -256 bit) to protect 
personal health information.  
All i

iPad after confirmation that the data were sent and received. All study site databases will be stored in 
an encrypted, HIPAA -compliant Cloud- based server with continuous data backup. 
8.0 Confidentiality and Privacy  
Confiden
tiality will be protected by collecting only information needed to assess study outcomes, 
minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify subjects, and maintaining all study information in a secure manner. To help ensure subject privacy and 
confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appear on the data collection form  and in study 
datasets . An honest broker will mediate the electronic health record data queries to limit the exposure 
of patient identifying information.  Our analyses require us to have full dates of visits (to determine the 
success of implementation over time), age, and  5-digit zip codes , and GEOIDs  (to determine rural  or 
urban residency). Therefore, the honest broker will create a limited data set for analysis. The day that 
each clinic launches mPATH will be called day 0, with each subsequent or previous date recorded as 
an integer relative to day 0. This will add additional protections for patients by obscuring dates in the dataset. Any collected patient identifying information corresponding to the unique study  identifier will be 
maintained i n a linkage file, store d separately from the data. The linkage file will be kept secure, with 
access limited to designated study personnel. S ubject identifying information will be destroyed three 
years after closure of the study, consistent with data validation and study design, producing an 
anonymous analytical data set. Data access will be limited to study staff. Data and records will be kept 
locked  and secured, with any computer data password protected. No reference to any individual 
participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise from the study.  
9.0 Data Safety and Monitoring 
The only anticipated risks specific to this study are loss of data confidentiality. The mPATH study database is hosted on an encrypted secure server maintained by Wake Forest Information Technology 
& Services  (ITS) . The database is password protected, and only authorized individuals are granted 
access. ITS routinely monitors for any security weaknesses or breaches.  In the unlikely event of a data 
breach, ITS will notify the PI  who will convene an internal Data and Safety Monitoring committee  to 
review the event and determine the appropriate response. The Data and Safety Monitoring committee will be comprised of the PI, Project Manager, study statistician, and study programmer.  Other 
individuals may be added to the Data and Safety Monitoring committee at the PI’s discretion.  In 
addition, the PI will promptly review any participant or other -reported concerns regarding the study. The 
PI will report any loss of data confidentiality or other adverse event to the Wake Forest IRB and the NIH 
within 2 business days of the discovery the event.  
10.0 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations 
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes 
will be promptly reported by the principal investigator or designated member of the research team to the 
IRB and sponsor or appropriate government agency if appropriate.

was kind enough to participate in his prior study of the mPATH iPad app about colorectal cancer 
screening. The study showed that the app doubled the number of patients who were screened for 
colorectal cancer. I’m calling now to invite your clinic to participate in a research focus group to help us 
learn how mPATH might be implemented in primary care clinics. If you are willing to participate, we would meet with your clinic staff and providers at your clinic site for a group discussion that would last 
no more than 60 minutes. Each person who participates in the focus group will receive a $50 gift card 
as a thank you for their time. We would schedule this meeting for the day and time that works best for

*** Confidential  *** A.3. Implementation Strategy Focus Group Moderator’s Guide  (Wake Forest Clinics)
FG Purpose :  To learn how mPATH can be implemented successfully in primary care clinics. 
The main overarching questions to answer are:  
1.What would make clinic staff want to use mPATH with patients?
2.How do clinic staff think mPATH wou ld be best incorporated into clinic flow?
3.What type of training and support will clinics need to use mPATH?
The guide  will:
I. Explore the facilitators and barriers to implementation
II. Strategies for minimizing barriers
III. The adequacy of draft training materials
IV. Additional support or training materials desired
V. Focus groups will also comment on the set of clinic check -in questions  proposed for
the mPATH -CRC iPad app
Focus groups will be audio recorded and the content summarized. Revisions to the 
implementation strategy and materials will be informed by the focus group results.

Hello and welcome to our session. My name is Nicole Puccinelli -Ortega. I am today’s focus 
group moderator. This is Donna; she will be assisting with the focus group. She will record our 
discussion and take notes on what we say, to ensure we don’t miss anyone’s comments.  
We want to thank you for being here today. We appreciate your willingness to share your thoughts with us. The reason you are here today is obtain your feedback about a program called mPATH. mPATH is a user -friendly iPad program designed to increase the efficiency and 
quality of care in primary care offices. While in the waiting room, patients use mPATH to

then transmits this information to the electronic health record, reducing data entry by nursing 
staff.  
Our goal today is to obtain your opinions about  how best to implement mPATH into a primary 
care clinic’s workflow. I will be asking for your feedback about the iPad program, our proposed clinic workflow strategy and our training plan. There are no right or wrong answers. Everything we talk about will be considered confidential. We will use the information from our conversations to inform our study team about the best way to implement mPATH in other clinics. There will not be any names used and no one outside of this room will know specifically who said what. Please do not share other people’s names or comments outside of the group. We will audio record today’s conversation and take notes. This helps us remember what you all said.

thoughts with me. The reason we are doing this interview is obtain your feedback about a program called mPATH. mPATH is a user -friendly iPad program designed to increase the 
efficiency and quality of care in primary care offices. While in the waiting room, patients use mPATH to answer standard check -in items and assess their need for routine cancer screening. 
mPATH then transmits this information to the electronic health record, reducing data entry by nursing staff.  
The purpose of the interview is to learn from you your opinion on how best to implement mPATH into a primary care clinic’s workflow. I will be asking for your feedback about the iPad program, our proposed  clinic workflow strategy and our training plan. There are no right or

Interview  Purpose :  To learn how mPATH can be implemented successfully in primary care 
clinics. The main overarching questions to answer are:  
1.What would make clinic staff want to use mPATH with patients?
2.How do clinic staff think mPATH would be best incorporated into clinic flow?
3.What type of training and support will clinics need to use mPATH?
The guide  will:
I. Explore the facilitators and barriers to implementation
II. Strategies for minimizing barriers
III. The adequacy of draft training materials
IV. Additional support or training materials desired
V. Interviews will also comment on the set of clinic check -in questions  proposed for
the mPATH -CRC iPad app

I. WELCOME
I want to thank you for speaking with me today. I appreciate your willingness to share your 
thoughts with me. The reason we are doing this interview is obtain your feedback about a program called mPATH. mPATH is a user -friendly iPad program designed to increase the 
efficiency and quality of care in primary care offices. While in the waiting room, patients use mPATH to answer standard check -in items and assess their  need for routine cancer screening. 
mPATH then informs the office staff of patients’ answers so they can update the electronic health record as needed.  
The purpose of the interview is to learn from you your opinion on how best to implement mPATH into a primary care clinic’s workflow. I will be asking for your feedback about the iPad program, our proposed clinic workflow strategy and our training plan. There are no right or

information from our conversations to inform our study team about the best way to implement 
mPATH in other clinics. I will audio record today’s conversation and take notes. This helps us remember what you all said. The notes and the audio will be kept in our offices and will not be shared with anyone outside our project. I would like for you to speak freely, sharing your ideas and opinions. You are the expert and there are no right or wrong answers.
 
You will be asked to complete a brief survey at the end  of our discussion, and you will 
receive a $50 gift card for your participation today.  
The interview should last between 20 and 30 minutes. Before I get started, are there any questions? 
 
II. MAIN QUESTIONS
Let’s get started.
Mot
ivators and Barriers
First, let me demonstrate the mPATH iPad program so you can see how it looks and how we are thinking clinic staff will use it.  
1.What are your first impressions of this program?
Follow -up q
uestions:
a.Based on what you’ve seen in the demonstration, do you think this would behelpful to you in your clinic? Why or why not?
b.What
 would motivate your team to use this iPad app?
c.What
 would discourage your team from using the app?
2.We prog
rammed the app to ask patients the standard clinic check -in questions, hoping
that would save nurses some time. Do you think that feature is helpful or not helpful?
(Probe,
 if needed) Tell me why you say that.  
Follow -up question:  
a.What other features could the app do that would make your job easier and makeyou excited to use it?

*** Confidential  *** 3.Patients will independently answer the check -in questions on the iPad, and the program
will show the patients’ answers to the person who is rooming the patient. The rooming
staff would then enter the answers into the electronic health record.
Tell me
 your thoughts about that process.
Follow -up q
uestion:
a.Tell me your concerns.
Clinic 
Workflow 
I am g
oing to walk you through what we are envisioning to be the typical pattern of patient 
check in and how staff and patients will hand off and use the iPad.  
(Dis
play clinic workflow poster/slide illustration and walk through the flow.) 
4.What
 are your immediate thoughts about this workflow?
Follow -up q
uestions:  
a.What do you like about this workflow?  And why?
b.What
 don’t you like about this workflow? And why?
c.Are th
e front desk staff the best people to hand the iPad to patients? Why or why
not?
5.The app i
ncludes audio narration and a video about colon cancer screening. If we gave
patients disposable earbuds when they are handed the iPad, do you think they  could
use the app in the waiting room? Why or why not?
Follow -up q
uestions:
a.Do you think audio in the video is important? Or do you think reading closedcaptions would be enough?
b.How coul
d patients use the app without earbuds? Would it disturb other patients

with clinic flow?
Follow -up q
uestions:
a.On average, how long do patients wait from check -in until the doctor sees them?
7.How many
 iPads would a clinic of your size and patient volume need to ensure this
process didn’t interfere with patient flow?
8.If a pat
ient is 50 or older, the app will determine if they are due for colon cancer
screening. If they are due, it will help them get a test ordered. If your clinic decided to
use this program, would it be best to offer it to all patients on check -in, or only those
who are 50 and older?
(Probe,
 if needed) Tell me more.
For Clinic Manager ONLY  
9.Could our team email you later to get a list of the intake questions your clinic routinelyasks patients?
For Physicians (MDs, NPs, PAs) ONLY  
As you saw, if patients are between 50 and 75, mPATH asks them about their colon cancer screening history and desire to be screened. mPATH will generate a summary of 
each patients usage so you know what they said. Here are two examples of what the 
printed summary would look like. (show examples of mPATH app output)  
10. Would you find this printout helpful or not helpful? Why or why not?
11. What
 do you think about the length of the printout?
Follow -up q
uestion:
a.Is it too much information or not enough?
(Prompt if needed): Tell me what you would remove (if too much information) 
(Prompt, if needed): If not enough information, what else would you want to know?

Traini
ng and Support (for everyone – if time permits)  
In a few months, we will be helping some clinics incorporate the mPATH program into their workflow. Now I will tell you about the training and support we are planning to give those clinics 
so you can tell me what you think about our plans.   
We will first ask each clinic to identif y a person working in the clinic, a “clinic champion,” who 
will help keep the program going and serve as our main contact. If the clinic wants us to add 
additional check -in questions to the mPATH program, we can do that for them. We will also 
hold a 45 minute on- site training session with the clinic staff to give them practice using the 
mPATH program. Afterwards, we will provide the clinics with as needed technical support by phone, email, or in person.  
13. Tell 
me your thoughts about this training plan.
Follow-up ques

B.  Construct:  Impact of mPATH on Universal Screening and CRC screening  
Now I would like to ask you some questions about the universal screening questions that 
Wake Forest  mandates all clinics ask on a routine basis, which include questions about 
depression, falls in older adults, and household violence or abuse.  
  
1. How are patients screened for these risk factors (Probes:  at check -in via a paper -based 
self-completed screener, asking patients directly, using other tablet based screening)?  
Did you play any role in screening patients?  If yes, explain.

Appendix D – Effect of mPATH on Screening for Depression, Fall Risk, and 
Safety  
 
Wake Forest policy requires primary care clinics to  screen patients  aged 18 and older  for 
depression,  fall risk, and safety at home at each provider visit. Nursing staff conduct this 
screening during the rooming process by asking patients standardized questions and recording their responses in the electronic health record.  
 We designed mPATH to save staff  time by having patients answer these same screening 
items on an iPad and then transmitting their answers to WakeOne.  It is possible that mPATH 
will increase detection of depression, fall risk, and safety concerns because: 1) mPATH 
systematically asks these screening items of all patients, and 2) patients may feel more comfortable answering these items in an iPad survey than during an in- person interview.  
 To determine the effect of mPATH on the performance of this screening, we will examine a limited use dataset comparing the 2 months before a clinic started using mPATH to the 2 months after the clinic began using mPATH. Because clinics may need some time to fully adopt mPATH, we will exclude the first two weeks following the launch of mPATH.  
 Study Population 
We will create a limited use dataset containing patients who are seen in one of the first six 
Wake Forest Baptist Health primary care clinics that are participating in the mPATH Effectiveness and Implementation trial. 
 
Patient inclusion criteria : 
• Age 18 or older  
• Completed a provider visit at the study clinic during the 60 days prior to the clinic launching the mPATH program (the “pre” time period), or completed a provider visit at the study clinic during days 14 – 73 after the launch of mPATH (the “post” time period)  
• Have a preferred language of English or Spanish 
 
Patient exclusion criteria: 
• Requiring a language interpreter for a language other than Spanish  
 Experimental Methods The limited use dataset will contain the following data elements for each completed patient 
visit: 
• Date of clinic visit  (where each date is indicated by a number relative to the clinic’s 
Launch Date)  
• Clinic (designated by a unique study  clinic identifier)

*** Confidential  *** • Type of visit completed (for example, new patient visit, return patient visit, annual exam)  
• Patient age  
• Patient gender  
• Patient race/ethnicity  
• Patient primary insurance  
• N ursing staff who roomed the patient  (designated by a unique study identifier)  
• Whether patient used mPATH -CheckIn program (Y/N) 
• Whether nursing staff used mPATH Nursing Module to transmit mPATH data to 
WakeOne (Y/N)  
• Whether patient has a diagnosis of depression in the problem list in the EHR (Y/N)  
• Whether patient has an antidepressant medication listed in the active medication list (Y/N)  
• Results of depression screening items  
• Results of fall risk screening items  
• Results of safety at home screening items  
 The study dataset will be maintained using the procedures outlined in Section 8.0 (Confidentiality and Privacy) . Of no te, we are taking the following additional safeguards to 
further protect patient confidentiality:  
1. Dates of clinic visits will be designated using numbers relative to each clinic’s launch 
date, rather than using the actual date  
2. Clinics will be designated with a unique study clinic identifier instead of clinic name  
3. Nursing staff will be designated with a unique study identifier instead of actual name  
 Definition of Time Periods  
• The day a clinic  launches mPATH will be designated as that clinic’s Day 0 
• The “pre” time period will be D ays -60 to - 1 (the 60 day period before mPATH Launch)  
• The “post” time period will be days 14 to 73 (the 60 day period commencing 2 weeks after mPATH Launch)  
 Outcome Measures  
Primary outcome: The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients seen in each time 
period (“pre” vs. “post”) who screen positive for depression, fall risk, or safety concerns at home.  
 
Secondary outcomes : Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of patients in each time 
period who: 
• Screen positive for depression using the PHQ -2 items. In addition, the outcomes below 
will be assessed:  
o Have a PHQ9 score >14 (indicating moderately severe depression or severe depression)  
o Have a PHQ9 score >19 (indicating severe depression)  
o Have a PHQ9 score >14 and are not currently taking a medication for depression

assessed: 
o Report that conflicts  turn into fights  
 
Analytic plan  
Our primary analysis will compare the proportion of  patients seen in the “pre” ti me period to the 
“post” time period who screen positive for either depression, fall risk, or safety at home.  If a 
patient is seen more than once in a given time period, only the patient’s first visit in that time period will be included in the analyses. We will estimate the proportion who screen positive for  
each time period and report along with 95% confidence intervals. A chi -square test will be used 
to provide an unadjusted comparison between the “pre” and “post” proportions. Logistic regression models will then be used to compare the “pre” and “post” proportions while controlling for clinic and patient demographic variables. We will use the same analytic methods 
for our secondary outcomes.  We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis for our primary 
outcome where we consider all patients’ visits during a given time period (and not limit 
analyses to a patient’s first visit in the time period only) . For this sensitivity analysis, we will 
compa re the proportion of patients who meet our primary outcome definition at any visit  during 
the “pre” and “post” time periods.    
Analytic adjustments due to COVID19 pandemic : Due to the COVID19 pandemic, all practices 
stopped using mPATH in March 2020, which is prior to the closure of the 60- day “post” time 
period for clinics #5 and #6 in our sample. Therefore, we will truncate the “post” time period for 
these two clinics to 30 days. To determine if this truncated time period affected our overall 
results, we will conduct the following sensitivity analyses: (1) limiting the analyses to only the 
first 4 clinics to enroll, and (2) limiting data collection to 30- days post - for all 6 clinics.

*** Confidential  *** Appendix E – Data Transfer from non- Wake Forest Health Network Clinics 
The fol
lowing was the original plan for 
In Wa
ke Forest Health Network clinics , mPATH connects to the electronic health record (EHR)  
to import basic patient demographic data (e.g., patient name, medical record number, age) and 
prior colorectal cancer screening history information to determine if screening is needed. For clinics outside of the Wake Forest Health Network, this data will be imported to mPATH using secure file transfers . Non -WFHN clinics will upload  a weekly flat file  using Secure Fi le Transfer 
Protocol to an encrypted, HIPAA -compliant Cloud -based server . The mPATH program will 
process the file , encrypt needed data elements,  and then delete the original data file to protect 
data security.  Additional data safeguards are outlined in Sec tion 8.0. Formal data use 
agreements will be executed with all participating external sites. The flat file will include the 
following elements  for patients who have upcoming scheduled appointments in the clinic(s) :

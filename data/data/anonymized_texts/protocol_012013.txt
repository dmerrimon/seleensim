The primary objective of the INFINITY  Trial  is to assess causality  between 24-hour systolic BP levels and preservation of 
mobility, cognitive and urinary  function  associated with reduced accrual of small vessel disease of the subcortical white 
matter in people over the age of 75 years.
 A key hypothesis of the trial is that intensive  treatment  of 24-hour  systolic  BP to levels of 130 mmHg or less will result in 
improved gait time, stair descent time, and maximal gait velocity  compared to treatment  of 24 hour systolic BP to levels 
of 145 mmHg  or less.  This separation of ambulatory BP goals should achieve at least a ≥10 mmHg  differences between 
groups over time. Previously,  this difference  has been  shown to be responsible  for the mobility decrements  associated 
with WMH  in older patients with systolic hypertension in a prospective cohort study (Circulation. 2011;124 (21):2312-9. 
doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.037036). 
Prior to database lock of this trial in October 2018, we have added several secondary analyses to be pre-specified with 
their rationale as needed.

between the intervention group and the reference  group  and thus the parameter of primary interest;  is a i
random intercept  for participant   that addresses the correlation in WMH % across the two time points; and i

hour systolic BP was < 135 mmHg would be excluded from the sensitivity analysis; an intensive group  
patient whose 24 hour systolic BP was > 135 mmHg  would  be excluded from the sensitivity  analysis).

This analysis will be repeated for each mobility  parameter (gait speed, four stair  ascent  and descent time,  
supine to sit time), cognition scores  (Trailmaking  A and B, Stroop Color  & Word score, and simple reaction 
time), and the Geriatric Depression Scale.  The timed measures – Trailmaking A and B, and simple  reaction  
time – will be inverse-transformed  so that they have a speed interpretation; this will also reduce the 
influence of outliers.  Similarly,  all analyses will be repeated as stratified  analyses  (b - e below).

3.Change in urinary severity index  and depression category (based on the Geriatric Depression Scale) from 
baseline to 3 years. These analyses will be similar to the analyses for white matter hyperintensities in (1) and for 
mobility and cognition in (2), but using  ordinal  logistic regression.

Bootstrap standard errors and confidence intervals will be used  for statistical  inference, including estimation  of 
standard errors and confidence intervals. 
In secondary  analyses, age, sex, and resultant ambulatory systolic BP at 36 months regardless of treatment 
assignment will be considered as mediators  through similar  methods.  Specifically,  age, sex, and systolic BP will 
replace in the model above and similar  measures of interaction and mediation will be estimated. 2 1 i i m m

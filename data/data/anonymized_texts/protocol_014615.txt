  SPECIFIC  AIMS  
The project will develop and pilot test the Location Initiated Individualized Texts for African 
American Adolescent Health (LIITA3H), a mobile application to aid healthy food choices.  
 
The obesity epidemic in the US has disproportionately affected African American (AA) adolescents who have a prevalence of obesity that is almost 50% higher than that of their Caucasian peers.  This higher prevalence is due in 
part to greater exposure to, and higher consumption of, fast food and calorie dense foods among minori ty 
populations than their majority peers.  Finding effective ways to address dietary habits affecting childhood obesity in 
general and in African American adolescents particu larly is vital to averting the magnitude  of obesity -related 
illnesses and the assoc iated costs that are likely to cloud the future of American children.   
 Youth consume a significant proportion of their calories during school, often from two sources 1) school meals and 2) other eating venues (e.g., fast food restaurants, convenience stores ) near  school s. For AA adolescents, school -
related food choices are un iquely impacted by economic and environmental factors.  Specifica lly, many receive  
free/reduced meals, thus packing a lunch is often difficult  and selecting from the options at school is the most 
feasible approach.  Furthermore, a significant number of AA adolescents live and attend school in low -income 
communities with a disproportionally high prevalence of surrounding fast food restaurants and convenience stores.  
Better  ways to help AA adolescents mak e healthy choices in these obes ogenic environments is 
critical  to reduce the disparity between them and their peers.    
 Our clinical and research experience suggests that tailored texts linked to location will improve  choices . Our clinical 
work  in the Michigan Pediatric Outpatient Weigh t Evaluation and Reduction (MPOWER) program suggests that an 
intervention based on Self -Determination Theory that use s motivational interviewing to increase motivation  is 
effective, but  adolescents’ success with making healthy choices is greatly impacted by their school environment. Our 
preliminary research  in the MPOWERed Messages intervention , incorporating the theories  used in MPOWER,  
indicated that adolescents welcom ed individually relevant  health -related text s that used social m arketing  and 
provided cues to action. Importantly, they believed the texts helpe d them make healthy choices but suggested  it 
would be better if they were sent at time s when they faced dietary  choices.     
 Proposed Intervention:  The LIITA
3H intervention  will include  3 components: 1) Personal Geo -location 
mobile technology to identify when students  are in their school cafeteria or other eating  venue s with an  “intent to 
eat”; 2) Culturally and individually t ailored text messages  to promote healthy choices in the se venues; and 
3) Message s delive red to students when they are in eating  locations and a mechanism for them to  respond with 
information about their eating experience such as  an annotated photo  of their selection .  
 Hypothesis : We hypothesize that the LI ITA
3H intervention can be developed to automatically and accurately send 
text messages, tailored to recipients’ preferences  /characteristics, when they are making  selections in their school 
cafet eria or other eating venues , and that these health -focused messages will encourage healthy choices.  
 
We will accomplish the following 3 specific aims:  
Aim 1 : To develop an integrated mobile phone application that will a) accurately identify when students are in their 
school cafeteri a or other eating venue , b) automatically deliver a tailored text message that  prompts  healthy choices , 
and c) receive a photo  of food choices annotated with  the user’s health rating of the food . [For this amendment we 
aim to optimize the previously develo ped app to automatically identify a larger number of fast food restaurants 
(FFR) using GPS monitoring and by incorporating additional user input regarding the app design]  
Aim 2 : To develop a message library adapted from the previously tested MPOWERed Messa ges library that can be 
tailored to students’ food preferences, the menu opti ons from their school and fast food venues, and incorporate 
cultural tailoring with input from the target population.  [For this amendment we will utilize additional focus groups 
and an Adolescent Advisory board to provide additional input regarding the tailored messages and app design] 
Aim 3 : To explore , in a 1 -month pilot, the accep tability, feasibility and use  of the intervention developed in Aims 1 
and 2, via usage data collected by the application plus semi -structured interviews with participants  and with school 
personnel who might speak to any disruption to school functioning encountered during  the p ilot.  [For this 
amendment we will pilot test the enhanced app to assess whether its use, over 6 months, is associated with fewer 
calories purchased from FFR and fewer visits to FFR . 
 
3 
  We have shortened our study period time frame from 6 months to 1 month  due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
This study will provide pil ot data to inform our planned R01  proposal to test the impact of the intervention o n 
behavior.  We expect to develop LII TA3H as a marketable intervention, attractive  to institutions interested in cost-
effective means of improving health and impacting point of purchase choices.  As a mHealth intervention, it can 
easily be scaled to include numerous participants.  Further, the methodology may be adapted to address other 
conditions, offering the potential to reduce a wide range of health disparities.

  RESEARCH STRATEGY 
A. SIGNIFICANCE  
African American (AA) adolescents have a disproportionately high prevalence of obesity, putting them at risk for a myriad of illnesses in their youth and for incurring a greater burden of morbidity 
and premature mortality than their Caucasian peers.   
While the prevalence of obesity (BMI >95
th percentile for age and sex) for Caucasian adolescents is 16.1%, for AA 
adolescents the prevalence is markedly higher at 23.7%.1,2 Not only are more AA adolescents obese, but more are 
severely obese (BMI >97th percentile) than their Caucasian peers (18% vs. 11% respectively).1 The impact of obesity 
has short and long term health consequences increasing the likelihood of numerous illnesses during their youth, and 
putting them at risk for developing early cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and many cancers  as adults .3-6 
Moreover, the effect of obesity goes beyond the individual to impact the society by augmenting healthcare costs, a 
problem that starts in childhood, as obese children have higher healthcare costs than their normal weight peers.7-10 
It is vital  to find ways to decrease the prevalence of obesity and reduce the burde n of disease and 
related health care costs, particularly among AA adolescents.   
 
Obesity has proven to be remarkably refractory to treatment.  Clinical treatments for obese adolescents (both in 
primary care and multidisciplinary interventions) have shown no or only modest suc cess.11-13 Furthermore, 
treatment outcomes are typically worse for AA adolescents, com pared to Caucasian participants.12-14 Based on the 
Self-Determination Theory and utilizing motivational intervi ewing to deliver evidence- based content, the Michigan 
Pediatric Outpatient Weight Evaluation and Reduction (MPOWER) program, is a family -focused, multidisciplinary 
program for obese adolescents that  has shown promising results, that d id not differ by race.15 This likely wa s due to 
the level of individual tailoring incorporated into the program. However, our clinical experience in the MPOWER program suggests that despite intensive treatment  adolescent s’ success with making healthy choices is greatly 
impacted by their school environment . Indeed, youth consume nearly 35 percent of their total daily calories duri ng 
school hours while food eateries, such as corner stores, located near schools  play a major role in their daily food 
consumption .
16-18 Finding ways to help adolescents make healthy choices du ring the school day is 
imperative  to improving obesity treatment efforts.   
 The rapidly increasing capabilities of information and communications technologies along with the ubiquitous use of 
mobile phones by all ages and races, presents an opportunity to reach out to patients during the course of their daily 
activities to conveniently deliver individua lly tailored interventions at low cost.19,20 As such, the possibility exists to 
revolutionize health care delivery and to minimize disparities.  However, previous research indicates that using these 
technologies without rigorous testing and attention to message content and timing  may have unintended effects.21 
In our MPOWERed Messages intervention, we created and tested a library of computer tailored texts addressing weight -related topics that were sent automatically  at set times to promote healthy choices.  This study revealed that 
adolescents were enthusiastic about  receiving the messages but they indicated that it would be more effective if 
they were delivered at times when they faced specific choices, such as at me als.
22 Augmented location technology 
has the potential to identify when adolescents are in venues such as a school cafeteria or a restaurant and allow 
delivery of messages when they might have the greatest impact.    
 The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on obesity highlights the urgent need for effective obesity interventions, particularly for minority patients.
23 By identifying when AA adolescents are making meal choices during the school 
day and automatically sending text messages that are culturally tailored and tailo red to individual preferences, we 
believe the Location Initiated Individualized Texts for African A merican Adolescent Health 
(LIITA3H) mobile app has the potential to significantly impact dietary choices and aid the reduction 
of obesity in this high risk population.   
 In this project we will develop the capability to identify when students are in food related venues (e.g. , their school 
cafeteria or in fast food restaurants or convenience stores in the vicinity of their school) and to link this with 
evidence -based tailored text messages to enc ourage healthy choices.  In addition, we will pilot test the intervention 
with at-risk AA adolescents who attend schools in low -income neighborhoods where a high proportion of students 
receive free or reduced school meals and where there is a disproportionately high number of fast food restaurants 
and convenience stores.  This will provide the initial data needed to inform a large r trial in  Phase 2 of the 
intervention to demonstrate impact on food choices and BMI.  Furthermore, this technology will have the po tential to 
be extrapolated for use in other interventions requiring sophisticated location data to enhance message delivery. As such, the opportunities for commercialization are vast.

  B. INNOVATION  
B.1. Personal Geo -location  Technology  
The Problem : AA a dolescents are often faced with calorie dense  foods and obesogenic environments . Tailored t exts 
may prompt  healthy choices, but as suggested by t eens in our  MPOWEREd messages study, they may be most 
effective  if delivered  at the time food is presented . This complex task , that requires linking message delivery to 
presence in an eating venue at a relevant time , has not been incorporated into  intervention s for adolescents. 
Personal geo-locatio n might  accomplish this goal , but we believe this requ ires precision , as our prior work suggests 
that texts  could trigger  eating . Specifically, a student near  an eating venue , but not aw are of it  or not planning to eat , 
may be triggered to eat if they receive a text about food at that venue . Hence, it is important to use  the advanced 
technology we have available to ensure messages are delivered when students are in an eating venue with the intent 
to eat.    
 
The Innovations : MEI Research developed the modular, easily customized “ActiPalTM” mobile smart device 
application.24,25 ActiPal integrates into a single application data from built -in and external sensors, presents a rich 
user interface of surveys (e.g., ecological momentary assessments  (EMA) ) and actionable data, and maintains r emote 
communication.26,27 ActiPal rapidly configure s software that minimizes user burden while performing the functions 
needed for prospective data collection and behavioral interventions.28 This  native software (i. e., it lives  on the phone 
and does not need  an internet connection) , has automatic restart and other features that ensure reliable 
performance .29   
 ActiPal works with “P iLR Healthware” to collect 
objective and subject -reported data.
30 This very 
powerful combination of technologies allows investigators to create surveys, assign them to subjects or 
subject groups, and initiate interactions with participants when pre -determined (tr igger) conditions occur 
(Figure 1 ). The triggers can be based on any objective 
source (time, location, speed, etc) or initiated by investigators and participants (e.g., tapping a widget ). 
Responses from the subjects are uploaded to the server in 
real-time for analysis and action by the investigator. PiLR 
is built on a Java application stack (Linux, Tomcat, MySQL, Java Server Pages). The Java application uses the 
Model -View -Controller (MVC) pattern integrated with 
MongoDB to store data. PiLR del ivers software 
updates and new content to ActiPal on a schedule . ActiPal and PiLR are in nearly constant communication when the 
mobile device has an internet connection.  
 The LIITA
3H project will use  this powerful  integrated application and user interface as a novel geo -linked tailored 
messaging intervention. Key technological innovations to be created include:  
1) The personal location information system (pLIS) that allows students to register preferred and likely  eating 
venue s (cafeteria, fast food restaurant, convenience store) as they are encountered.  
2) System that records  and refines venue time/ radius parameters to improve prediction accuracy . 
3)  After training the pLIS , it will be activated to deliver tailored texts  prior to users choosing  a food . 
 
B.2. Cul turally and I ndividually T ailored Text Messages  
The Problem : While it  is important to deliver text s at the right time and location, it is also necessary to deliver 
content that is individually and culturally relevant to optimize  the impact on behavior. This has yet to be achieved in 
a weight -related mobile intervention for adolescents. Further, prior studies suggest efforts are needed to aid 
engagement as  teen s may ignor e the texts over time  if they  are not viewed as varied or relevant .31  
 The Innovation : Our messages will be innovative in 3 ways: 1) they will be tailored to students ’ individual 
characteristics and food preferences, 2) they will reflect the style, tone, vernacular, graphics  and content preferred by 
the target population of AA students (determined by prior work in cultural tailoring and by focus group findings) and 3) recommended choices will be linked to menu options for their location ( the healthiest options o n the eating 
venues’  online menus will be identified in advance for use in the study ).

  C. APPROACH  
This project will test an infrastructure to de liver culturally and individually tailored , evidence -based  texts  to 
adolescents at the time and location when they make food choices . During Phase 1 we will determine separately how 
well each of the fun ctions can be achieved. A Phase 2 proposal will test effects on behavior , ensure long -term 
engagement, and determine how to achieve ‘scale-u p’ that reaches any participant and  accommodates an extended 
geography. As required in an STTR, “commercial developm ent” will occur in  Phase 3.  
 
C.1. Integrated Mobile Phone Application (Aim 1)   
To a) accurately identify when students are in their an  eating venue, b) automatically deliver a tailored text 
message that prompts healthy choices , and c) receive annotated  photo s of students’ food choices.  
 
C.1.a. R egistration and D etection of Eating Venues with Intent to Eat.  Detectin g when students are in an 
eating venue with the intent to eat will use our  personalized location information system (pLIS).  A traditional 
Geographic Information System (GIS) assigns geographically referenced parameters to data types.  For many cities a 
descr iption of every street , business, bus stop, school and even smaller details are available. However, ‘full up’ GIS is 
too burdensome and expensive for individually targeted interventions and aren’t needed . Behaviors and 
environments experienced by a single person have interactions with a limited number of locations. This provides the 
opportunity to develop a GIS behavioral dataset for each individual, such as our pLIS. The system will dynamically 
integrate objective and context data into “just enough” mapping. 
 
The personali zed location information system  (pLIS) will run on a student’s 
mobile phone to determine when they are i n an eating location with the intent  to 
eat. We will enhance and test functions to perform  the following : 
1. Rapidly determine location indoors and outdoors, using  a "fused 
provider" service that combines cel lular tower signal triangulation 
(E911) wit h satellite augmented GPS  and local RF (e.g., WiFi) signals. We 
will use the Google Location Applicat ion Programming Interface 
(http://developer.android.com/google/play -services/location.html ).  
2. Enable each student to mark a unique set of ea ting locations by the 
ActiPal and PiLR Healthware EMA tools (Figu re 2).  
3. Recognize presence in an eating ve nue with an “intent to eat” by: 
a. Creating customizable recognition boundaries around each marked location, called “Geofencing”.  
b. Assign ing a “dwell time” of duration within the eating location 
boundary that can be m odified by the participant and dietitian.  
c. Assign ing “meal times” for each participant that c an be modified by studen ts.  
d. Using the EMA tools to ask  students whether they intend  to eat in a training period prior to delivery of 
tailored texts .  
[For this am endment newly available databases and technology that make it feasible to automatically 
identify when users are in FFR, will be used  to create an enhance location identification (ELI) system . 
 
C.1.b . Message and Intervention Content Framework t o Automa tically Deliver Tailored Texts a nd 
EMA questions . For this  Phase 1  proposal , message coordination and content will be organized and presented with 
the existing PiLR capabilities, described above. These are sufficient to manage up to 100 participants 
simultaneously. The MPOWERed message library will be transferred to a database logically integrated by a C ommon 
Record Interface and MIME t ype that identifies content. Data formats and standards for objective and subject- report 
data will be  linked to the system through an internal Collector component that implements a Configure interface 
telling other components details of how the data are collected.  
 The EMA tool will be used to assess whether the messages are delivered appropriately and wi ll address  questions 
such as: whether the text was  received appropriately prior to making a food choice, whether  the text was relevant to 
them, and whether the text infl uenced their choice. In addition to these general survey questions, individualized 
ques tions can be asked such as “yesterday you indicated that your food choice had a health rating of very unhealthy, 
are healthier options available today?” . [For this amendment newly available technology will be incorporated to 
enhance the ability to survey p articipants and to manage hundreds of participants simultaneously].

  Students will use ActiPal’s capability to annotate image s to allow students to submit photos of their food choices and 
to annotate them , based on their perceptions of the food, with a Likert scale rating of very healthy to very unhealthy. 
Annotations may be made either by voice recording or touching marked buttons on the screen.   
 
C.2. Culturally and Individually Tailored Text Message Library (Aim 2)   
The MPOWERed Messages Library , designed to be tailored to individual  characteristics and food preferences, will be 
adapted to include recommendations from eating  venues ’ menus , and to incorporate cultural tailoring . 
C.2.b. Message Library A daptation . The MPOWERed Message Library was originally created for obese teens, 
and texts were tailored to baseline characteristics, preferences, and values.  For the proposed project, texts w ill be 
revised  to ensure relevance for AA adolescents, and those in all weight categories . Further , because the app is not 
limited to  160 character s, we will be able to expand the mess ages to include menu -based recommendations  tailored 
to students’ preferences.  
Cultural Tailoring Focus Groups . To ensure cultural  relevance , we will conduct  focus groups with students 
(inclusion criteria: AA, 1 3-17 years old; e xclusion criteria: Non English speaking ).  
Population and Recruitment  – A convenience sample of adolescents  (6 to 8  for each of 8 additional  group s) will be 
recruited via flyers distributed at trial schools /community agencies  with a number to text/call if interest ed.  The 
project manager (PM) will contact parents to describe the study and schedule them for a focus group. Assent/consent will be obtained at the focus group.  Or for schools that prefer the parents to contact the research 
team rather than the RA calling the parents, study information packets will be made available for students to take 
home to their parents.  The packets will include a letter of invitation with instructions for the parent to call the research assistant to discuss the study and to provide consent.  The package will also include the consent d ocument 
for parents to sign and return to the study team. Assent will be obtained at the focus groups.    A $25 gift card 
incentive will be given.   
Focus Group Discussion – The groups will meet for 2 hour s at the ir school  / community location  will be facilitated 
by the PI  (along with a note taker)  and will be audio recorded. Basic  data will be obtained on age, sex, height and 
weight. In the first  45 min, the app design and messages  (Table 1)  will be  discussed  and input el icited on  ways tailor 
it to individual/cultural preferences . After a break, 
the last 45  minutes participants will complete a 
survey of preferences for cultural tailoring, along with the Multiethinic Identity Scale . 
Analysis and Revision of Text Messages  – 
Transcripts will be reviewed, coded, and themes identified independently by 2 team members using the constant comparative method .
32 The language, 
graphics and content desired by the target population will b e incorporated into the texts  along 
with cultural  tailoring developed in prior  studies.
33  
Message Testing Groups . A sample of the  
adapted  texts  will be tested with the target population (2 groups with 6 to 8 students/ group). Population, 
recruitment and consent/assent as above.  Based on methods used successfully in our prior studies , studen ts will use 
an OptionFinder audience response handset34 to indicate for each text if  they:  (1) Really liked it  = No Changes , (2) 
Thought it was O.K. = Improve , or (3) Did not like it =  Reject . Messages with ≥ 60% “really liked” and tho se with 
60% “did not like” rating will be viewed as a consensus and not discussed further.  All others will be discussed  to elicit 
suggestions for improvements.   The research team has extensive experience with testing and revising text mes sages 
for use in behavioral  interventions.  Students will receive a $25 gift card  for participatin g in this  2-hour group.  [For 
this amendment, message testing groups will be replaced with a 5 – 10 member adolescent advisory board recruited . 
Key informants from th e community  (e.g., teachers our  previous studies) will be asked to provide  recommendations 
for possible members, and adolescents will also be selected from participants in the  focus groups. The PM will 
contact t he parents to describe the board.  If they give verbal co nsent for their adolescent to participate, teens  will be 
contacted to discuss the study and to assess their interest. Signed  consent/assent will be obtained at the first 
meeting. Teens  will receive a $50  incentive per month of participation . 
For convenience, these 90 minute meetings will be held in Detroit, Flint and Benton Harbor, and attendance  
via Skype or VSee teleconferencing will be offered. Meetings will be facilitated by the PI who works extensively  
with adolescents in clinical and research setti ngs.  
Tailored Menu Recommendations . Additional menus will be obtained f rom schools and popular fast food 
venues.  The healthiest  options will be identified from each venue for a variety of categories (e.g., sal ty foods, dairy 

8 
  foods, etc ). The lists will be used to offer recommendations based on user s’ location and preferences (e.g., in 
McDonald’s  a student  who said  they like dairy foods on the baseline survey, might be asked to try  a parfait).    
Following completion of Aims 1 and 2 the LIITA3H system (Figure 3) will be ready for pilot testing.  
 
C.3. Pilot Trial (Aim 3)  
We will study the feasibili ty, acceptability  and use  of the LII TA3H system  via a pilot with  four 1 -week phases.  [This 
amendment will test the app impact on frequency of visits to, and calories purchased from, FFR in a 6 -month pilot].  
 
We have shortened our study period time frame from 6 months to 1 month  due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
C.3.a. Population and Recruitment.  We will  recruit 150 13-17 year old s, with a BMI>85th percentile who eat at 
FFR at least 3 times/ week)  from each of the 3 cities . Recruitment and consent/assent are as above.  Students  will 
receive two $30 gift card s as an incentive for participation. A cell phone will be provided for those who do not own 
one. Payment will also be provided to cover the costs of internet access for thos e who need it.  
 Due to the COVID -19 situation that hampers physical contact, recruitment for the research study trial (to replace the 
in-person enrollment sessions due to the COVID situation) will be conducted virtually through 
UMHealthResearch.org and through a Facebook and Instagram advertising campaign managed by MICHR and linked to our UMHealthResearch study page.  
  
 
C.3.b. Enrollment Session . Upon obtaining consent /assent, an enrollment session will be scheduled. At this 
session students’ height and weight will be measured and t hey will complete an online enrollment  survey  addressing 
preferences, baseline characteristics, current habits, values, ethnic identity , their level of interest in making d ietary 
changes and any changes they might wish to make. They will download the app and receive instruction in its use, 
including photo submission and rating foods on a Likert scale of very healthy to very unhealthy . They will be 
informed that they  will be randomly assigned to use one of three versions of the app by the technology team who will 
apply to  appropriate functionality to their app.  
 Ame00110293  
Due to recruitment and enrollment efforts being conducted virtually because of the COVID -19 pandemic, 
participants will be guided as they take their own height and weight measurements. Since this will be done remotely, we will send any participants who require a scale, a tape measure, a square, and/or pencils, the necessary materials, which they will be ab le to keep.  
 
Randomization – The technology team will randomly assign participants as they enroll to either the  
intervention or one of the control groups. They will then adjust the functionality of the app for the participants  
accordingly, and will send a message to their phone indicating their group assignment, along with instructions  
for their group. Thus, the research assistant who collects data will be blinded regarding group assignment.  
 
C.3.c. Four Week Intervention  
Week 1 – Student Registration of Ea ting Venues . Students will be asked to identify, usi ng ActiPal, when they 
are in an eating venue (cafeteria, restaurant, or convenience store). The venue data  (time  and location) are registered 
 
9 
  in PiLR. They will be encouraged  to submit  a photo of their food choice s and annotate it with a rating on the very 
healthy to very unhealthy scale.28 By the end of week  1 the system will have collected data about the most frequent 
eating locations, when they typically eat there, and what food they  choose .  
Week 2 – Eating Venue Identification . We will  use the system to identify and contact st udents when they are 
in eating venues. We will ask students via an EMA survey  whether the system is correct. For erroneous detections 
the appropriate stored ve nue criteria (location, geofence, time of day or dwell time) will be adjusted to improve 
detection.35 For correct detections the y will be asked to report on their food  choice.  
Throughout the study students will be able to identify  newly  encountered eating venues.  If the app does not 
recognize it, they will be asked to register that location (as they did in week 1). The first assessment of eating venue 
recognition accuracy will be calculated. Investigators will make an overall assessment of recognition criteria and potentially correlated factors such as neighborhood or which school the student attends.  
Week 3  – Delivery of Location Linked Tailored Messages . In week 3 the system w ill try to deliver a relevant 
message  when a student enters an eating ve nue with the inten t to eat. EMA surveys will elicit whether messages are 
appropriate  (i.e., received prior to making a choice, the venue is correct, the suggested food is  available ), relevant 
(i.e., suggestion  matched their preferences), and if/how it influenced their choic e. At the en d of week 3 the feasibility 
and acceptability of location linked tailored texts  will be demonstrated.  
Week 4 – Inclusion of EMA Questions Including Feedback . During  week 4 we will assess the feasibility and 
acceptability of including content  that provide s feedback on earlier choices.  The EMA tool will be used to provide 
information from a recent choice and to request current information (e.g., students may  be reminde d of the health 
rating of their choice from the day before and asked whether there are healthier options available today ). In addition, 
the EMA tool will be used to congratulat e students  for making healthier choices and for submitting the requested 
photos.  Students will be asked to provide their perspectives as in week 3.  
For this amendment weeks 1 to 3 will not be repeated.  Participants will use the app for 6 months in one of 3 groups.  
 
We have shortened our study period time frame from 6 months to 1 month  due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 Intervention Group 1 – Participants will be asked to keep the app running on their phone. They will receive  
a ping when the app identifies that they are in a fast f ood restaurant followed by a point of purchase  promp t, tailored 
to their  preferences and the options available at that location. If they are in a venue without a menu , general healthy 
suggestions will be provided (such as “consider choosing smaller portions” or “does this venue  sell fruit?”). If the app 
does not ping when they enter a restaurant, they will be asked to register that location by  tapping the ‘register 
location’ button on the app and entering the restaurant name. For detection errors, the  appropriate stored venue 
criteria (location, geo -fence, t ime of day or dwell time) may be adjusted to improve  detection. Users will also be 
asked to take a picture of any items they buy and to annotate it with information that would help to determine the nutrients in the food. Annotations may be audio, text, or made from a  selection of descriptive buttons (e.g., to 
indicate small, medium or large sizes).  
Control Group 2 – Participants in Control Group 2 will receive similar instructions to those given to group 1,  
but without receiving point of purchase  prompts.  
Control Group 3 – The Location Only Control Group 3 will only get information about location detection,  
and asked to register FFR if the app does not indicate with a ping that they have entered one. Their instructions  
will not discuss photo docum entation of food or prompts as these features will not be active on their app.  
 
During the s tudy period, the participants will be contacted once per month by a research team member. Monthly calls will  be 
added to help gather feedback from participants about the app. S tudy participants will be contacted by phone on three separate 
occasions, at times when the participants are not in school (e.g. after 4pm on weekdays or a weekend). If, for any reason, a 
research team member is unable to reach a study participant after three attempts, we will connect with the parent and/or 
research liaison (e.g. a staff member at the school or community organization we are working with) for assistance.  
  C.3. d Post Interv ention Assessment  
Semi -Structured Interviews.  At the completion of the 6- month trial  (or sooner if they appear to have dropped 
out) , adolescents  will be interviewed to obt ain detailed feedback about PiLR, the subject interface, methods of 
prompting, EMA surveys, entering data, submitting photos and rating foods. Location data will be used to inform the 
questions in the interview. For example,  participants who, based on the GPS, have not visited FFR will be asked to 
share reasons for this ch ange. Those  who, based on the GPS, continue to visit FFR, will be asked about the choices 
made, and what if anything  would be most helpful to them when they are making the choice regarding what to 
10 
  purchase. They will also be  asked about the user interface,  cultural tailoring, and the SNAP component.  Interviews 
will be transcribed and coded by 2 researchers separately.  
 
For the semi -structured interviews  at the end of the study period, s tudy participants will be contacted by phone on three 
separate occasions, at times when the participant s are not in school (e.g. after 4pm on weekdays or a weekend). If, for any 
reason, a research team member is unable to reach a study participant after three attempts, we will connect with the parent 
and/or research liaison (e.g. a staff member at the school or community organization we are working with) for assistance.  
 
We have shortened our study period time frame from 6 months to 1 month  due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
Quantitative Survey . Acceptability Measure : A questionnaire will assess acceptability of the format (What was 
their experience, did they like it?; How would you rate the overall experience?), and feasibility (How easy was it to use the hardware and respond to prompts?). Acceptability and feasibility mean scores of 3.5 or greater, rated on a 
scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), are deemed acceptable.  
Assessment of Usage.  Electronic Usage Measures : During the pilot , the  PiLR will automatically record  (1) the 
time students spent u sing the system, (2) the frequency of triggering events, (3) compliance with prompts, (4) and 
whether subjects felt the system was responsive.  If will automatically record number of visits to the FFR. It will also 
collect usage data in regard to things lik e frequency of submitting pictures and whether they include annotations.  
 
C.3. e. Analyses  
Primary Outcome  – Feasibility of the technological components 
Based on students’ responses when using the system  we will determine 1) the percentage of the time that the system 
accurately identified presence in an eating venue and correctly identified the registered venue (cafeteria vs. convenience store), and 2) the percentage of time that an appropriate and relevant message was delivered.  
For this amendment, c alories purchased will be assessed using submitted annotated photos, and nutrition data  
from FFR menus (e.g., if the participant submits a picture of McDonald’s fries and indicates it is a small order,  
then from the McDonalds menu, we will determine that the calories purchased were 240 kcals). Frequency of  
visits will be obtained directly from the app. We will use population averaged generalized estimating equation  
regressions (GEE) to compare trajectories of calories purchased and number of visits between groups. The GEE  
approach allows us to account for the correlation in repeated observations collected from each subject over  
time. For calories purchased, we will perform GEE linear regression modeling a s a function of time, treatment  
group (intervention vs. control group 2) and the interaction of time by treatment group (Y= 𝛽𝛽 0 + 𝛽𝛽 1𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇  + 
𝛽𝛽2𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇  + 𝛽𝛽3𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇  ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇  + 𝜖𝜖). Similarly, for the number of visits, we will fit  a GEE Poisson regression  
model as a function of time, treatment group (intervention vs. control group 2 vs control group 3) and the  
interaction of time by treatment group. Residual diagnostics will be performed to examine departures from  
model assumptions. If necessary, we will use transformed outcome variables and refit the models.  
Secondary Outcome 1  – Acceptability of the intervention and the messages 
From the post -pilot  interviews we will identify students’ perceptions of the intervention overall and o f the messa ges 
specifically. We will explore opinions of school personnel  on impact s of using the LIITAH a t school.  Data from post-
pilot interviews plus the advisory board input, will inform revisions of the app and planning for a larger trial.  
For this amendment, we  will use the models discussed above  to examine associations between  calories purchased  
/number of visits including as covariates participant characteristics such as extent of app use, initial BMI, and ethnic 
identity (as an ordinal measu re assessed via the Multiethnic Identity Scale)  as a secondary outcome . 
Secondary Outcome 2  – Exploration of  food choices 
As an exploratory analysis to assess for feasibility in preparation for a phase 2 trial, the U of M research team will 
apply  MPOWER gu idelines (regarding fat, fiber, sugar and calorie content) to assess whether students’ food choices 
in week 4 were healthier than those in week 1 using the uploaded photos , accompanying  student  annotations , and 
nutrition information  from venues’ menus . We also will explore any associations between change s in food choice  and 
student characteristics (i.e., sex, level of interest in making changes, BMI).

  C.5. Limitations  / Potential 
Problems  / Alternativ e Strategies  
For the benefit of cost and time, we will 
build the Phase 1 system with readily 
available and free Google services 
combined with  our existing ActiPal 
objective data / EMA applications. Both require the Android operating system (OS). Android is currently th e most 
popular smart device OS so we expect at least half of  the students will have a 
compatible device. Students who do not own a smart device may be issued one for use in  the study.  In Phase 2 we will 
extend the system to Apple (iOS) and other OS popular  at that time. iOS  is not 
economical to implement in Phase 1 due 
to commercial distribution restrictions 
applied by Apple Corporation.  
 
The Google location API combines all of 
the most robust services available , including augmented GPS , cellular triangula tion (E911) and local RF (e.g., WiFi). 
An outcome of this Phase 1 will be to assess our ability to detect eating locations. However, for critical locations, such as a school cafeteria, we will be able to augment the current Google location database if fail ures are detected. The 
solution is simply to place a $15 WiF i transmitter anywhere in the eating venue and register its unique “MAC” 
address with Google. The transmitter would be recovered at the end of the study. The transmitter will not be connected to t he internet. More RF sources are being “discovered” and entered in the Google and similar databases 
constantly, so we expect that by the time Phase 2 work begins supplemental marking devices will not be needed.  
In any human research there is always the pos sibility of difficulty in recruiting. However, 3 schools have agreed to be 
trial school s. Further,  in past studies, we have found adolescents are enthusiastic about participating .  
 C.6. Commercialization  
The ActiPal and PiLR Healthware  systems are used in a wide variety of healthy messaging applications, from 
smoking to weight management and clinical pain control. Once the present methodologies have been developed and proven through an RCT by the University of Michigan and MEI, it will be moved to primary markets, including health and wellness centers, obesity clinics, and corporate wellness programs.  This academic and small business 
collaboration will lead to the development of a sophisticated evidence- based tool  likely to aid in reduci ng health 
disparities by promoting healthy choices among AA adolescents, and which will be marketable to address this and other situations where timely location -linked messaging may be helpful .

PROTECTING NURSING HOME RESIDENTS FROM INFECTIONS AND READMISSIONS 
Data Collection 
The goal of Project PROTECT is to evaluate whether a decolonization strategy can 
better protect residents from multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) and their 
associated infections and hospitalizations when compared to routine bathing and 
showering. To understand the impact of decolonization, we will assess several 
outcomes: 
Primary Outcome 
•Transfers due to infection (% of discharges to a hospital due to infection)
Secondary Outcome 
•All cause admissions (% of discharges to a hospital)
Other outcomes of interest include MDRO prevalence (MRSA, VRE, ESBL, CRE), 
antibiotic usage, and emergence of resistance (strain collection). Project  PROTECT 
coordinators will work  closely with the on-site study  champions to collect  data 
on measured  outcomes.  Additionally,  data will be obtained  from state and 
national  datasets.

Project PROTECT Introduction  
Your nursing home has agreed to participate in Project PROTECT, a 
federally funded randomized trial of nursing homes in Southern 
California. Project PROTECT is being conducted by infectious di seases 
physicians at the University of California Irvine, and Harbor -UCLA.  
 
From this training you will learn:  
Why Project PROTECT is important  
Which group your nursing home belongs to  
The importance of routine care  
How to contact study staff for additional information  
 
This training module will take approximately 10 minutes to complete  
 
2 15
This trial is evaluating whether bathing with special antiseptic soap plus 
using nasal products to remove nose bacteria (universal decolonization)  
is better than routine bathing in nursing homes in reducing infection 
and antibiotic -resistant bacteria  
The goal is to:  
Reduce transfers to hospitals due to infections  
Reduce antibiotic use  
Reduce multi -drug resistant organisms ( MDROs)  
The 28 Southern California nursing homes participating in this trial will 
be randomized to one of the following groups:  
Group 1 : Routine Care  
Group 2 : Universal Decolonization  
Intervention begins April 2017  
 
 What is Project PROTECT?  
3 16
Your nursing home has been randomized to Group 1: Routine Care  
This means you will continue routine bathing and showering of all 
residents with your usual products  as you are already doing  
 Group 1: Routine Care  
Maintain Current Bathing/Showering  
4 17
 
Every new strategy needs to be compared to an existing strategy to 
know if it is better or not  
Strategies that are not better than current care, should not be adopted  
Nursing homes in the routine care group serve as the current gold 
standard to assess whether decolonization is helpful or not  
Remember , decolonization is labor -intensive and incurs cost, so we only 
want to implement if we are absolutely certain it is effective  
Critical to maintain current practices  
Do NOT adopt decolonization  Importance of the  
Routine Care Group  
5 18
Here is a scenario on the importance of maintaining current practices:  
Let’s assume decolonization has a real effect. Group 1 (Routine Care) 
nursing homes add in some additional interventions that improve 
infection rates while Group 2 adopts Universal Decolonization. The trial 
shows no difference between Group 1 and Group 2 nursing homes and 
decolonization is deemed to be not -effective. No nursing homes adopt 
decolonization and an important and effective solution is lost.  
By working together, all nursing homes in the PROTECT Trial will 
collectively learn the effect of the decolonization strategy  It is Critical  to M aintain Current 
Practices  
6 19
Competing Interventions  
7 IMPORTANT  
Participation in the routine care group includes an agreement to NOT 
implement new quality improvement initiatives that involve CHG or 
iodophor  
 
Your key role is to maintain current processes for bathing and 
showering. Do not change current basic  practices.  
 
 
20
Special Circumstances  
8 If a physician places an order to decolonize a resident with iod ophor, 
chlorhexidine, or both, you should do the following:  
 
1. Follow the physician orders  
AND 
2. Remind the physician that this nursing home is part of Project 
PROTECT. This nursing home has been randomized to the routine car e 
arm which does not involve routine decolonization of residents.  
 
 
21
 No. The IRB has granted a waiver of consent.  
 
 This protocol has approved by the UC Irvine IRB and is in compliance  
with the Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR part 46), to be 
implemented as a minimal risk project. Specifically, this project c ompares 
two Quality Improvement strategies . This improvement strategy has met 
all criteria for waiver of consent. A handout will be provided for all 
residents upon admission to the nursing home.  
  
Is Resident Consent Required?  
9 22
This is a landmark trial to identify the best strategies for 
reducing infection, antibiotic use, hospitalization, and multi -
drug resistant organisms (MDROs) in nursing homes.  
 
Your role in the Routine Care group of this trial is critical to 
understand whether decolonization is or is not beneficial 
over current best practice.

Instructions  
 Apply iodophor swabs twice daily  for 5 days every 
other week  
 Clears bacteria that live in the nose that can cause infection, like S. aureus (including MRSA)  
 80% of S. aureus infections are caused by bacteria in 
the resident’s own nose  
 
Povidone -Iodine use in specific circumstances  
 If nasal device in place (NG tube), swab around  
tubing if possible  
 If nasal packing in place, do not apply to that nostril  
 STAFF  
Do NOT blow nose if solution drips.  
Gently wipe with a tissue.  
Clean nostrils (including tip) with tissues prior to  application Repeat with 2nd swab in other nostril Apply nasal povidone -iodine antiseptic swabs to all  
residents twice daily for 5 days every other week 
to help remove germs and prevent infection  
 How to Use:  
Insert swab into one nostril and rotate for 30 seconds, or at least 3 times around slowly, covering all surfaces. Discard swab.

Randomization 
The unit of randomization will be the nursing home, with all residents within a 
nursing home assigned to the same arm. Cluster randomization is the only feasible 
randomization method when an intervention must be applied (or is typically  applied ) to an 
entire group, such as a quality improvement initiative. It is  also the only method for 
evaluating interventions for which individuals are linked, e.g., by shared exposure to 
contagious illness, as occurs in nursing home s. Cluster randomization also has the 
advantage of studying interventions under conditions of actual use, of minimizing 
disruption to normal practice, and of allowing the use of healt h system resources for 
ensuring compliance with the intended treatment.  
In cluster -randomized trials, the relatively smaller number of randomized units 
means that simple randomization may not ensure balance of key variables by chance alone. 
The existence o f a priori  data allows us to improve balance through stratification. One way 
is to establish pairs with similar covariate profiles in which one member per pair is 
assigned to each arm. There is no “best” method of making pairs. One approach we used in 
86
a prior trial145 is to calculate the Mahalanobis distance between facilities across all 
available key variables and choose the pairings with the minimum average within -pair 
distance. In this approach, we standardize the variables and then multiply by values 
calibrated to reflect any difference in their importance with respect to balance.  
To select the best pairing scheme, we will compare this distance method to other 
pair construction schemes, using graphical methods to compare the balance between the 
arms und er each scheme. For example, if two variables had to be balanced, we could 
tentatively divide the sample into two groups under a pair construction scheme and then 
generate a scatterplot showing the between -arm absolute value of the mean difference for 
one variable on the x -axis and the second on the y -axis for each possible result of the 
randomization. We would then divide the groups again under the same scheme, and find 
another point on the scatterplot. Repeating many times would show the typical distribution 
of balance under a scheme. Comparing the resulting scatterplots from each scheme can 
reveal the relative risks of imbalance and benefits for balance accruing to each scheme. One 
scheme may result in close balance on one key characteristic and very variable balance on 
the other, while a competing scheme may have good median balance on both 
characteristics, but a long tail implying a few bad -luck assignments with poor balance.  
We aim to balance facility case mix based upon population age, wounds, 
comorbi dities, and functional status scores, as well as infection prevention activities 
assessed by survey . To assess balance, we will use a parallel coordinates plot, a 
multivariate plot method. A simulation  (Figure)  shows a potential result of a single pair 
construction method using baseline values of volume, outcome, device  
use, and bathing frequency. Each blue, red, green, or black line  
shows the mean difference between arms for all four variables 
for one realized randomization under the scheme. The results 
show that a few randomizations, in blue, are relatively 
imbalanced on volume and outcome but are balanced on device 
use and bathing, while a few others, in black, have the reverse 
pattern. The green and red realizations are approximately 
equally balanced across these variables. If we considered it 
more important to balance on volume and outcome, this would 
not be an ideal scheme, as medium or poor balance is common.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
All outcomes will be assessed similarly. Here, we use the example of  the primary 
outcome: the probability a transfer to a hospital is for an infectious diagnosis . Mai n trial 
results will be based on as -randomized, unadjusted analyses using logistics regression 
models. Clustering within nursing home will be accounted for using random effects, which 
are added model terms that allow unique baseline rates  for each nursing home , and are 
necessary to account for clustered randomization. Model terms will include individual -level 
data on arm, nursing home, outcome events, trial period (baseline vs. intervention) and an 
interaction term between trial period and arm. T rial succes s will be determined by the 
significance of the interaction term, which assesses whether the difference in log odds 
between the baseline and intervention period differs significantly between the two arms. 
We can write a simple version of the model symbolic ally as:  Volume         Outcome   Devices           Bathing  Figure. Parallel  Coordinates Plot Showing

readmission rates at each nursing home , and account s for the clustering within a given 
nursing home. The ultimate effect of the intervention is assessed by 𝛽𝛽3. If it is negative with  
p-value < .05 (or 95% CI excluding 0) , then we can conclude that the intervention reduces 
the risk of infectious transfer.  
 Subsequent analyses will include as -treated and covariate -adjusted models. 
Adjusted models will account for individual age, gender, comorbidities (by diagnostic 
codes), and fun ctional status scores. All analyses will use current versions of SAS (9.4),  
SAS/STAT (13.2, SAS  Inst itute, Cary NC) and/or R (3.1.2). 
 
Power  
We assessed p ower via resampling methods. We used preliminary data  on outcomes  
adjusted to an 18 -month baseline and  intervention period. First, each nursing home  was 
randomly assigned to a study arm. Then, individuals were sampled with replacement from 
within each nursing home  to simulate  “baseline” period data. Individuals were sampled 
again to simulate the “follow -up” period data.  For nursing homes  assigned to  intervention 
arm, observed readmissions among the sampled follow -up individuals were removed at a 
given probability  to reflect the effect of the intervention.  Finally, the analysis planned for 
the trial was conducted  on the resampled “baseline” and “follow -up” data. In this case, the 
planned analysis is a generalized linear mixed model logistic regression with main effects 
for period and arm, with the study effect assessed via their interaction, as described abov e. 
To es timate power, we repeated this process 2 00 times. The proportion of times that the 
null hypot hesis of no interaction effect was rejected, with alpha = .05, provided  the 
estimated  power.  In contrast to analytic approaches to power, we also needed to  find 
confidence limits on the estimate, which we did using exact methods.  For cluster -
randomized trials, this approach has the advantage that it does not require guessing t he 
value of the intra -class correlation coefficient, or , importantly, its variability.  In addition, 
this approach  does not require a n assumption of constant cluster size.   
For our primary outcome, p reliminary data showed that 21.3 % of  hospital transfers 
from nursing homes were  due to infection. For the probability of transfer due to infection, 
we assessed the pow er for a relative reduction of 15 %, from 21.3% to 18.1 %. Power  was 
estimated at 89% (95% CI [83%, 93%]). For  our key secondary outcome of the probability 
of transfer to a hospital among discharges, our preliminary data sh owed  that 37.8 % of  
discharges were associated with admission to hospitals across the nursing homes. For this 
outcome, w e estimated  the power for a relative reduction of 8%, from 37.8 % to 34.8%, to 
be 99.5 % (95% CI [97%, 99.9%]). Even at  a relative reductio n of 5%, we have 74% power 
(95% CI [67%, 80 %]). These effect sizes are meaningful  because there is tremendous 
88
national interest in reducing preventable readmissions, of which infections are a major 
cause. Reductions in overall readmissions of 1-3% are lauded as sizeable in the CMS 
Hospital Readmissions Program which fined 2,225 hospitals in its first year, with each 
fraction of a percent resulting in substantial lost revenue. The second year of this program 
saw a reduction of 0.6% in all  cause readmissions.  In summary, our  power assessment 
demonstrates adequate power to detect plausible and meaningful  effects of the proposed 
trial.

Study Conditions and Period  
 
Participating nursing homes (28) we re randomized to  
• Arm 1 – Routine Care  
Nursing homes in this group arm did not change their bathing materials, timing, 
schedule, or other aspects of bathing regimen.  
• Arm 2 – Universal Decolonization  
Nursing homes in this group  used chlorhexidine  soap or wipes  for admission 
bathing and then for  all resident bathing.  They did not otherwise change their 
bathing materials, timing, schedule, or other aspects of bathing regimen.  In 
addition, nasal iodophor was  administered  twice daily Monday through Friday, 
every other week.  
Study Period s  
• 18-month baseline period : September 2015 -Febr uary 2017  
• Phase -in period: March -June 2017 (not included in analysis)  
• 18-month intervention period: July 2017 -December 2018  
 
Note that the baseline period occurred before the beginning of trial activities, including 
randomization.  Data collection for primary and secondary trial outcomes used electronic 
sources and could not have been affected by randomization status.

Main trial results will be based on as -randomized, unadjusted analyses using

individual -level data on arm, nursing home, outcome events, trial period (baseline vs. 
intervention) and an interaction term between trial period and arm. Trial results  will be 
assessed through the interaction term, which measures  the difference in log od ds between 
the baseline and intervention period between the two arms. We can write a simple version 
of the model symbolically as:

demonstrates adequate power to detect plausible and meaningful  effects of the proposed 
trial.

Statistical Plan Amendments  
 
Date  Statistical Plan Amendments  
2/4/2015  Original  
8/20/2018  • Defined ‘other’ outcomes for secondary publications . Previously, clinicaltrials.gov 
listed both secondary outcomes for the primary manuscript and outcomes for 
secondary manuscripts under the same heading. After the ability to separate th e two 
under “other outcomes,” we clarified additional outcomes that were not  trial 
outcomes.  
o Multidrug -resistant organism (MDRO) colonization  (separate aim from the 
trial in original grant; distinct design, methods, collection, analysis ) 
o Hospital transfer due to infection, in Long Stay and Short Sta y Subsets  
o Hospital transfer  for any reason , in Long Stay and Short Stay Subsets  
o Emergency Departme nt visits d ue to Infection; overall and in Long Stay and 
Short Stay Subsets  
6/19/2019  • Remov ed secondary outcome ( antibiotic usage ) 
o We had proposed to use the CMS Minimum Data Set (MDS) to assess this  and 
other trial  outcome s. At the time of the grant proposal, antibiotic usage was a 
newly -added variable. We assumed that this variable would increase in usage 
and accuracy with time. However, even five years after the variable was 
added, expert opinion from the creators of the MDS dataset, was that 
antibi otic data capture in MDS was poor and insufficient  for analysis . Thus, 
the steering committee removed this as an outcome and filed a change with 
clinicaltrials.gov at that time. We note that MDS data is released 18 months 
following completion of a calendar  year. This decision was made prior to 
receipt of any intervention data ( 2017 -2018 MDS data ) for the trial  and prior 
to any data cleaning or  analysis.  
8/10/2019  • Updated layout, no change in content or meaning  
• Removed randomization details from statistical  plan

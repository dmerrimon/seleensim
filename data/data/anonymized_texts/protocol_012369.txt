Title:  Evaluation of the Effectiveness , Safety and Tolerability  of the 
ContraMed VeraCept  Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive for 
Long- Acting Reversible Contraception 
Protocol #:   CMDOC -0008 
Version 5.0 / 19 September 2017  
  
Device Name:  VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive (referred to as 
VeraCept or Study Device throughout this document)  
  
Study Design:  Prospective, multi -center, single -arm, open -label, Phase II clinical 
study  
  
Study Purpose:  To evaluate the effectiveness, device placement, safety, and 
tolerability of VeraCept  to support commencing a Phase III 
Clinical Study  
Study Duration:  Subject enrollment will take approximately 4 months . Each 
subject  will be followed for 12 months  after device placement  for 
the protocol endpoints , and then every 6 months  thereafter  for 
those subjects who wish to continue study device use 
 
Enrollment:  Up to 250 subjects will be consented, screened and have 
VeraCept  placed , with a goal to have 2240 evaluable cycles at 12 
months .  It is planned that 225 of the 250 subjects will be within 
the 18 -35 year age range, with a total of 2015 evaluable cycles .  
The remaining 25 subjects will be within the 36- 40 year age 
range . 
  
Investigational  
Site Information:  This study will be conducted at up to 14 centers in the U.S  
  
Follow -up:  Physical a ssessment (office visit) will occur at weeks 6, 13, 26 
and 52 after placement , with monthly telephone contact.   For 
those subjects who wish to continue study device use after 12 
months, follow -up office visits will occur every 6 months  with 
contact at the end of each 28- day cycle  beginning after the 52-
week visit .  Additional visits will be conducted if  necessary for 
safety issues.  
Follow -up after e arly study device removal: 
Subjects requesting VeraCept  removal  to become pregnant will 
be followed to pregnancy or until the subject changes her mind about trying to get pregnant.  All subjects in whom  VeraCept  is 
removed prior to 12 mont hs, for any reason, will be required to 
use an alternative contraceptive for the first two  weeks following 
removal.  Hormonal contraceptive pills will be reimbursed by the

Note :  If subject has a current IUD that is being removed; if subject had monthly 
menses, you do not need to wait  any amount of time between removal of her first IUD 
and placement of VeraCept – however, if pain is present you should wait until pain has 
resolved with prior IUD before insertion of Veracept.  It is however suggested the 
subject have a return of menses if she had amenorrhea prior to placement.  
  STATISTICAL METHODS  
 Effectiveness Outcome  
 The primary efficacy population will include all subjects aged 18- 35 who had a study 
device successfully placed, provided at least 1 day of diary data, and were not pregnant 
before the IUD was placed.   
 
Effectiveness will be evaluated as the absence of pregnancy during VeraCept use for 
up to12 months.  Pregnancies judged to  have occurred during  study device use 
(determined by ultrasound and medical assessments), for w hich the estimated date of 
conception was within 7 days after study device removal or calculated date of expulsion,  will be included in the per protocol analysis of pregnancies.    
 The Pearl Index (and 95% confidence intervals) will be calculated through 12 months 
for cycles in subjects aged 18- 35 at the time of study device placement, excluding the 
following  cycles (unless the subject became pregnant in the cycle): 
• When  back -up contracepti ve or emergency contracepti ve use was documented on 
the daily diary   
• When the subject denied having any  intercourse.   
All pregnancies will be counted in the intent to treat analysis.  
 Life table analyses will be used as further assessment of pregnancies. Secondarily the Pearl index and life table analyses will be done through 3 years.   
  
Safety and Other Outcome Measures  
 
VeraCept  ease of placement , removal  and placement  success will be descriptively 
summarized.

Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 11 of 44 Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence of adverse events  and serious 
adverse events  changes from baseline in other assessments (examinations and vital 
signs) and by relationship to the study device or study device placement procedure.   
Study device tolerability will be based on changes in bleeding and spotting patterns and 
study discontinuation (including reasons for discontinuation).  
Safety analyses will be bas ed on the experience of  all subjects who had attempted 
study device placement  and provided any relevant data.  Tolerability analyses will be 
based on the experience of all subjects who received a study device and provided any 
relevant data.  
 
Subjects will record frequency and intensity of vaginal bleeding through a daily diary.  
The number of bleeding or spotting days will be summarized for each cycle.  In addition, bleeding and spotting will each be summarized separately.  Bleeding analyses will 
include all subjects who had a study device placed and have at least 1 cycle where they 
were not pregnant and were providing bleeding -related diary data on the days in the 
reference period. 
 
In general, summaries of quantitative variables will include the sample size, mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. For qualitative (categorical) variables the summaries will include the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category.   
 
SAMPLE SIZE  
 No formal sample size calculations were performed for the study.  It is estimated  that 
with 225 subjects enrolled with age 18- 35, a 12 -month P earl Index of 0.6 (1 observed 
pregnancy), and 2, 015 evaluable cycles, we will observe a 95% confidence interval for 
the 12 month P earl Index of (0.1, 3.3).   
 2,015 evaluable cycles assumes that in the overall study : 
• Each subject will  average10 evaluable cycles of VeraCept  use 
• 1% of subjects will not pr ovide any diary data and will be excluded from the 
primary efficacy population 
• Subjects will not have intercourse or will use backup contraception in 9.2 % of 
cycles

The VeraCept  Intrauterine  Copper Contraceptive is designed as a birth control  device. 
There are over 62 million US women in their child- bearing years, ages 15 to 44. Thirty  
eight million (38M) use some form of contraception (62%). Thirty -one (31%) percent do 
not use or need contraception because they are either trying to get pregnant, are 
pregnant, are infertile or are not sexually active. Seven (7%) percent are at risk for 
unintended pregnancy since they are using no method1. 
Contraceptive options for those 38 million US women include permanent sterilization 
(tubal ligation or vasectomy  in male partner), contraceptive implants, intrauterine 
devices, injections, pills, patches, vaginal rings, male and female condoms, other female barrier methods, vaginal spermicides, and behavioral methods such as coitus 
interruptus and fertility awareness. Of all these methods, oral contraceptives are used 
by 30% of sexually active women. The more effective methods, such as intrauterine 
contraceptives, are used by fewer than 10% of women.
2 The CHOICE Study showed 
that the pill failure rate is 17-20 times higher than the failure rate with intrauterine 
devices .3,4  
Intrauterine devices have high initial costs, so early discontinuation rates have profound 
impacts on their cost -effectiveness. The early rates of user dissatisfaction due to 
complications or  side effects may be associated with the materials used in these 
devices and/or their design. The Copper T380A IUD has been associated with complaints of increased bleeding, inter -menstrual bleeding and cramping pain. The 
LNG-IUS (Mirena®) is also associated with early complaints of irregular bleeding 
patterns, cramping pelvic pain and with amenorrhea.  First year discontinuation rates for 
Copper IUDs in most studies range from 4- 15%.

With high unintended pregnancy rates in the U.S. (49%)1, additional effective, safe and 
long-acting reversible contraceptives are needed. An intrauterine device with low -dose 
copper that achieves high contraceptive effectiveness, minimizes side effects and has improved mechanical advantages could offer an attractive option to women seeking 
effective protection against unintended pregnancy.  We believe the VeraCept 
Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive embodies these advantages.  
Pilot Study of the VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
 A Pilot Study of the VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive in a population of 
parous women enrolled at a single site demonstrated the safe use of the study  device in

Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 15 of 44 approximately 463 subjects total in two phases of the study, representing approximately 
6,706 combined women- months (558 women- years) of experience.  
 
In this time period, there were no serious adverse events due to the study device or its 
placement. Discontinuation rate due to tolerability was low. There have been no intrauterine pregnancies over the course of the study to date, and one serious adverse 
event (an ectopic pregnancy ) early in the Phase I portion of the study. 
 
VeraCept was successfully placed in all enrolled subjects with no peri -procedural 
adverse events and without the use of anesthetics, pre- medication or mechanical 
dilatation.  The VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive, in this initial experience, 
satisfied the objectives of providing a safe, easy to place, conformable low -dose copper 
contraceptive that is highly tolerated.  
In the Phase II Confirmation portion of the Pilot Study, the Subject Continuation Rate is 
90% at 10 months, with only 2% expulsion rate and 3% discontinuation for tolerability.  
The remaining 5% discontinued due to other reasons (e.g. the desire to get pregnant or 
inability to comply with study follow -up requirements.)   
Comparative Study of the VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive 
 Subsequent to the Pilot Study, a 2:1 randomized, subject -blinded Comparative Study of 
the VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive vs. the TCu380 IUD is being  
conducted in a population of parous women enrolled at a single site.  The interim 
results to date demonstrate that VeraCept has achieved equivalent performance in 
terms of safety and effectiveness as compared to  the predicate TCu380 IUD, i.e. no 
serious adverse events and no intrauterine or ectopic pregnancies in either group, while 
achieving clinically and statistically significant improvements in subject- related 
outcomes such as improved tolerability, reduced expulsions and reduced pain- at-
insertion.  
 
 
VeraCept was successfully placed in 99.5% of all subjects to whom the study device 
was randomly assigned, with no peri- procedural adverse events, and without the use of 
anesthetics, pre- medication or mechanical dilatation. No new or unanticipated adverse 
events were introduced. Statistically significant improvements  (95% CI)  in Subject 
Continuation Rate, Tolerability, Study D evice Expulsion and Pain at Insertion were all 
demonstrated when compared to the control intrauterine device.  
 In this experience to date, VeraCept satisfied the objectives of providing a safe, easy to 
place, conformable low -dose intrauterine copper contraceptive without sacrificing safety 
or effectiveness. Study completion to 12 months and, subsequently, a larger multicenter study is warranted.  
 
This Phase II Clinical Study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness, study device 
placement, safety, and tolerability of VeraCept to  support a larger,  Phase III clinical 
study.

4.  STUDY TREATMENTS  
 
After the risks and benefits of study participation have been explained to the candidate, 
her questions have been answered, she has signed a written consent  and PHI form , 
and eligibility has been established, a subject identification number will be assigned by 
the Study Sponsor or designee.  If subject has a current IUD that is being removed; if 
subject had monthly menses, you do not need to wait any amount of time between removal of her first IUD and placement  of VeraCept – however, if pain is present you 
should wait until pain has resolved with prior IUD before insertion of Veracept.  It is however suggested the subject have a return of menses if she had amenorrhea prior to 
placement.  
 
4.1 VeraCept Intrauteri ne Copper Contraceptive (Dosage and Formulation)  
VeraCept  contains 175mm
2 exposed copper surface area. A single VeraCept design 
and dosage will be used in this study.  VeraCept will be supplied by ContraMed LLC.  
For further details, see the VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
4.2 VeraCept Supply and Administration  
Each VeraCept is preloaded in the inserter and packaged as a single use sterile 
system. Subjects will have VeraCept  placed on “Day 1 ” of the trial.  VeraCept  should be 
stored in its sterile sealed package until study device placement.  
See the Investigator’s Brochure for a more detailed VeraCept product description, and 
the VeraCept  labelling  for placement and removal instructions.   
4.3 VeraCept Storage and Accountability  
VeraCept  should  be stored at 25°C (77°F),  with excursions permitted between - 20 °C to 
+50°C ( -4F to 122F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].  
Study Device accountability, reconciliation and record maintenance are responsibilities 
that mus t be performed  by the study site in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements. Please refer to Appendix 1,  Investigator Responsibilities for a detailed

and collection. Shipping procedures to return unused Study Devices are detailed in the 
Study Reference Manual.  
4.4 VeraCept Dosage Modification  
All subjects will receive  the same VeraCept dosage of  175mm2 exposed copper surface 
area. No Study Devices will be replaced if an expulsion or removal occurs.  
4.5 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications are any prescription medications or over -the-counter 
preparations used by the subject taken from the time the subject signs the informed 
consent documents until Study Exit.   All concomitant medications, including excluded 
therapies, must be documented in the Concomitant Medication eCRF.  
4.6 VeraCept Retention Compliance  
Subjects will be instructe d on how to check for  study device  presence by feeling for the 
string s in the vagina.  Subjects will not be required to routinely check for  study device 
presence, but if a subject believes the study device may have been expelled or is no 
longer in place, the subject  can check for the study device string if desired.  If the 
subject does not feel the strings, feels more than the strings, or has expelled the study 
device, the subject  should be instructed to call for an urgent study visit and refrain from 
having sex or use appropriate non -hormonal contraception until further evaluation is 
completed .  For detailed instructions regarding management of missing strings, refer to 
the Study Reference Manual.   
 
5. OBJECTIVES

Note that a subject changing from an oral contraceptive, IUD or implantable 
contraceptive does not need to wait before switching to VeraCept subject to the criteria 
above.   If subject has a current IUD that is being removed; if subject had monthly 
menses, you do not need to wait any amount of time between removal of her first IUD 
and placement of VeraCept – however, if pain is present you should wait until pain has 
resolved with prior IUD before insertion of VeraC ept.  It is however suggested the 
subject have a return of menses if she had amenorrhea prior to placement.

12.4.1 End of Each 28 -day Cycle Contact (Post 52 Weeks + 1 w) 
Subjects will be contacted (e.g. phone calls , e-mail or text message) at 
the end of each 28 -day cycle , beginning after the 52- week  visit. The 
cycle is determined from the day of VeraCept insertion: 
o Verify s exual activity  
o Document any back -up contraception methods 
12.5 Early  Discontinuation Visit  
Subjects who request removal of VeraCept before 12 months will be required to 
use an alternative contraceptive for the first two weeks following removal.  A 
two-week supply of Hormonal contraceptive pills will be provided by the site  as a 
contraceptive option during this time.  
If a subject  request s VeraCept removal because of an adverse event , the Study 
Exit Visit described in Section 12.3 above should be completed and documented on the CRF at the time of VeraCept removal.  The subject will be followed until 
resolution of the event or 30 days after removal, w hichever occurs first .  Subjects 
experiencing an on- going adverse event will continue to receive the appropriate 
follow -up medical care.  
 
If a subject  requests  early discontinuation and VeraCept removal to become 
pregnant , the Study Exit Visit described in Section 12.3 above should be 
completed and documented on the CRF at the time of VeraCept removal.   
Additionally, subjects shall be followed for  either;  six (6) months , until they decide 
to no longer try to conceive or they become pregnant, whichever comes  first. 
Outcome data  regarding subject’s ability to conceive,  or the decision to no longer 
try to become pregnant will be collected via phone contact  and documented on 
the phone contact form.   
 
12.6 Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits m ust be documented on a follow -up visit CRF .  Medical 
evaluations will be conducted as indicated by the reason for the unscheduled visit.

CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 31 of 44 12.7 Emergency  Contraception  
If the subject suspects the VeraCept has expelled, she should contact the study 
site. Emergency contraception may be administered, according to product 
labelling,  if the subject suspects expulsion has occurred and an act of 
intercourse might be unprotected, and she does not want the risk of pregnancy .  
If the subject is subsequently found to have an in situ  IUD and desires  to 
continue in the study, the cycle during which she used EC will not be included in the analysis unless the subject conceives.  If the IUD is expelled, she will be 
exited from the study.   
 
13. Diaries  
Subjects will be instructed to complete diaries daily.  Diaries are designed to collect the 
following information for each day of each menstrual cycle:  
• Day of cycle  
• Date  
• Absence or presence of menstrual or other bleeding (none, spotting, normal or 
heavy)  
• VeraCept expulsion (yes, no , suspected)  
• Usage of additional birth control methods and type of birth control used  
• Presence of  abnormal pain or cramping 
• Other medical problems  
• All medications taken that day  
• Frequency of intercourse  
• Liner, pad and tampon usage  
 14. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Concomitant medications include any medication or health product (any prescription 
medications or over -the-counter preparations) taken from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent documents until Study Exit  and must be recorded appropri ately on the 
eCRF .   
15. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
During the study, the Investigator or study site personnel will be responsible for 
querying and recording adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), as detailed below. Subjects will also be required to record AEs on their daily diary. For the  
Sponsor to fulfill safety assessment obligations , the Investigator must report  all SAEs  to 
the Study Sponsor , whether or not they result from study participation, within 24 hours 
of learning of the event.  
15.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event occurring within the 
timelines specified in the protocol that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• Life- threatening situation (subject is at immediate risk of death);  
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 32 of 44 • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who 
received study device; or  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of serious adverse 
events  include, but are not limited to: intensive treatment in an 
emergency room , hospitalization for any reason, and extensive treatment 
at home for an adverse event.  An ectopic pregnancy is considered a 
serious adverse event.  
 
15.2 Definition Of An Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
subject administered an investigational  product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (that could include a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
 
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an 
onset date before the first date of attempted study device placement  is usually 
considered to be pre -existing, and should not be documented in the e CRF as an 
AE, unless there is an increase in frequency or intensity of that AE, but should 
be recorded as medical history.  
 • Any AE (i.e., a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) with 
an onset from the first attempt of study device placement  through Study Exit  
should be recorded as an AE on the e CRF. All AEs must be recorded on the AE 
eCRF regardless of the severity or relationship to study device. It is important 
that Investigators also report all AEs that result in expulsion or removal of the 
investigational product being studied, whether serious or non- serious.  
 Pregnancy is an outcome, and not an adverse event in this study. 
15.3 Causality: Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Event Relationship to 
Study Treatment  
 
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the SAE and AE to  study device 
placement procedure (procedure) or  study device  by using the following general 
guidelines:  
 
Not Related: A causal relationship between the study device  and the AE can be 
ruled out (e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause).  
 
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 33 of 44 Unlikely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to procedure or study device initiation which makes a 
causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
 Probably Related: A cl inical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to  first attempt of  study device placement , unlikely to 
be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
 Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to first attempt of study device placement, cannot be attributed to concurrent disease or other medical devices, drugs , or chemicals, 
and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal.  
 
15.3.1 Clarification of Adverse Events Related to Study Procedures 
Any untoward event that occurs from the beginning of the study device placement procedure until completion of placement, or from the 
beginning of the removal procedure until the completion of removal, will 
be reported as an AE. The AE should be recorded on the AE e CRF with 
a causality assessment of “related to study device placement 
procedure.” If the AE also meets the criteria for an SAE,  an SAE e CRF 
should be completed and submitted to Sponsor. 
 
15.4 Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Event Severity  
 
The Investigator will assess the severity of the AE using the following general 
guidelines:  
 
• Mild: An AE that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, 
and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 • Moderate: An AE that introduces a low level of inconvenience or 
concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures.  
 
• Severe: An AE that interrupts a subject’s usually daily activity and 
typically requires systemic drug therapy or other treatment (a severe AE may not necessarily qualify as a n SAE).  
 
• Life-threatening: An AE that put the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity.  
15.5 Adverse Event Outcome  
 The Investigator will categorize the outcome of each SAE and  AE according to 
the definitions below:  
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 34 of 44  
• Resolved: The subject recovered from the SAE or AE. 
 
• Resolved with sequelae: a condition whereby the consequences of a 
disease or injury include lingering effects.  
 
• Ongoing: At the time of the last assessment, the event is ongoing, with 
an undetermined outcome. Note: Ongoing SAEs and AEs are not 
considered resolved as a result of death and no SAE or AE stop date should be recorded for an AE that is ongoing at the time of death. 
 
• Fatal: Adverse Event directly caused death. The Sponsor may request 
that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations. If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the Sponsor should 
be provided with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.   Note: Death is an outcome  of an adverse event and not 
an adverse event in itself. All reports of subject death should include an adverse event term (other than “Death”) for the cause of the death.  
 
Since reporting of an SAE is required within 24 hours of discovery, Death can be reported as an initial event term and updated to the final diagnosis in a follow -up 
report. If an adverse event term is not provided, the Investigator will be queried to obtain the cause of death. Only in the rare occurrence that no verbatim description of an adverse event can be obtained from the investigative site will 
“Death – Unknown Cause” be used as the event term. 
 The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on 
the signs, symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE (and SAE if serious) and not the 
individual signs/symptoms.  
 In the case of abnormal labs or diagnostic tests judged to be clinically significant 
by the Investigator  a diagnosis, if known, or clinical signs or symptoms if the 
diagnosis is unknown, rather than the clinically significant laboratory finding or abnormal  assessment, should be used to complete the AE  or SAE eCRF. If no 
diagnosis is known and clinical signs or symptoms are not present, then the 
abnormal finding should be recorded on the AE  or SAE eCRF. If an SAE report 
is completed, pertinent laboratory data should be recorded on the SAE e CRF, 
preferably with baseline values and copies of laboratory reports.  
15.6 Prompt Reporting of SAEs to Sponsor  
 
The Sponsor has requirements for reporting serious adverse events to regulatory agencies for a drug under clinical investigation. The Sponsor must be 
notified within 24 hours of discovery and the Investigator determines that an 
adverse event meets the prot ocol definition of an SAE.  
 All SAEs occurring from the beginning of study  entry  through study exit require 
immediate  reporting to the Sponsor. Investigators should not wait to receive 
additional information to fully document the event prior to notifying the Sponsor 
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 35 of 44 but should provide as much relevant information as immediately available. 
Further details of the event can be provided as they become available. The procedures for reporting SAEs are as follows:  
 
• Complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report” form ; 
 • Submit the completed form to Sponsor;  
 
• For fatal or life- threatening events, also submit copies of hospital case 
reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable;  
 • The Sponsor may request additional information from the Investigator 
to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports;  
 
• Any fatal or life -threatening events should also be reported immediately 
by telephone to Sponsor;  
 
• The SAE e CRF should be completed as thoroughly as possible and 
signed by the Investigator before transmittal to Sponsor. It is very 
important that the Investigator provides an assessment of the causal 
relationship between the event and the study  device at the time of the 
initial report ; and 
 • The Investigator, or responsible person according to local 
requirements, must comply with the applicable local regulatory 
requirements concerning the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the IRB.  
15.7 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments 
as Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other 
abnormal assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, X -rays, vital signs) per se are 
not reported as AEs.  However, abnormal findings that are deemed clinically 
significant (i.e., associated with signs and/or symptoms or requiring therapeutic 
intervention) must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an adverse 
event (and recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious) as 
described previously. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other 
abnormal f indings that are detected after study  device  placement or  that are 
present at baseline and worsen following the placement of VeraCept are 
included as AEs ( or SAEs if serious).  
 The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical symptoms may also jeopardize the subject and may require 
intervention to prevent immediate consequences (e.g., a markedly high serum 
potassium concentration may not be accompanied by arrhythmia, yet be of a 
magnitude to require potassium -binding resin administration to prevent such 
ContraMed, LLC VeraCept Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive  
Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 36 of 44 sequelae). Subjects should undergo repeat testing of clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings as soon as they are recognized.  
15.8 Documenting Adverse Events 
 
Any AE occurring from th e beginning of the study device placement  procedure 
through Study Exit  must be documented in the subject’s study records and on 
the AE e CRF. SAEs that occur during the study must be documented in the 
subject’s study record, on the AE e CRF and on the SAE e CRF as appropriate. 
 
The investigator’s assessment of causality, severity and status of the adverse 
event must be documented. When a causality assessment is provided for a 
serious adverse event, it is important to include a rationale for the assessment so that a better understanding of the reported event can be compiled. The rationale should be accompanied by all available supporting evidence, including 
relevant laboratory tests, histopathology evaluations and the results of other 
diagnostic procedures. The Investigator’s rationale with supporting evidence is 
valuable when Sponsor performs a cumulative analysis of similar events.  
15.9 Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
 
All AEs and SAEs must be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, 30 days post study device removal, or the subject dies or is lost to follow -up 
(including withdrawal of consent), whichever occurs first . The Investigator is 
responsible to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as 
may be indicated to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or 
causality of the AE/SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathologic examinations, or consultation with other health 
care professionals. Follow -up information should be submitted to the Sponsor in 
a timely many as the information is obtained.  
15.10 Clarification in Reporting of Deaths 
 
All subject deaths (regardless of relationship to study device) should be reported 
that occur from the beginning of study device placement through Study Exit . The 
information should be recorded on the Subject Death form and the SAE e CRF. 
15.11 Post -Study Treatment Reporting Requirements  
 
For all enrolled subjects, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, 
that occur from the beginning of study device placement  through Study Exit  
require reporting to the Sponsor.   In addition, if the Investigator learns of any 
SAE at any time after a subject has had the study device removed, and such 
event seems reasonably related to study drug, the Investigator should 
immediately  notify the Sponsor.  
15.12 Study Device Malfunction  
Should the study device not  perform mechanically as expected, it is essential that 
it be returned to the study Sponsor for assessment.

16. PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS  and DEVIATIONS  
Except in the event of a medical emergency or where it is necessary to protect 
the safety, rights or welfare of the study subject, any changes to the protocol will 
require written approval of ContraMed LLC or designee.  Violations or deviations 
from the Cl inical Investigational Plan to protect the health and safety of the 
subjec t will be reported to the IRB  and as required by local regulations.  All 
protocol violations or deviations will be recorded on the case report forms 
(eCRFs). A protocol violation or deviation may be requested in advance of 
implementation and will be reviewed for approval  by ContraMed or its designee, 
or a violations/ deviation may be identified after the fact, by the Investigator, 
ContraMed,  or the monitoring staff.  Investigators will  be asked to provide an 
explanation for the all violations and deviations identified. ContraMed, or 
designee, will be responsible for analyzing deviations and may implement 
corrective actions as necessary.    
 
17. SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
At all times throughout this study, all parties shall strictly observe the confidentiality of 
subject’s health information.  All data shall be secured against unauthorized access.  
Each subject participating in this study will have consented to allow access to her data, as described during the informed consent process and document ed in the signed 
informed consent form.  Each subject will also sign an Authorization For Release of Protected Health Information (PHI) form granting ContraMed and its designees ac cess 
to her medical records, should she receive medical care from non- study sites where 
she gets care (e.g., emergency room, urgent care, etc.) .Each subject will be assigned a 
unique identifier.  All e CRFs will be tracked, evaluated, and stored using only this 
unique identifier.   HIPAA guidelines and regulations will be followed.  
 
The Investigator will maintain a confidential study subject list identifying all enrolled 
subjects. This list will contain the assigned study subject’s unique identifier and name .  
The Investigator bears responsibility for keeping this list confidential.  This list will not be 
provided to the study Sponsor and is only to be used at the study center.  
 Monitors and auditors will have access to the study subject list and other personally 
identifying information of study subjects to ensure that data reported in the eCRFs 
corresponds to the person who signed the consent form and the information contained 
in the original source documents.  Such personal identifying information may include, 
but not limited to, the subject’s name, address, date of birth, gender, race and medical 
record number.  
 In an effort to protect subject confidentiality , any source documents copied for 
monitoring purposes by the Sponsor or designee will be identified using the subject’s 
assigned unique identifier and personal identifying data  will be obscured . 
 
18. PREGNANCY DETERMINATION AND FOLLOW UP  
Suspected pregnancy will be confirmed with a urine pregnancy test.  A positive 
urine test will be confirmed by a serum test.  Pregnancies will be promptly

Phase II Feasibility Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)  
 
 
CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 38 of 44 confirmed and dated by ultrasound evaluation and medical assessment as 
needed. Presence or absence of the study device will also be determined by 
ultrasound.  Removal of the study device, if in place, will be performed as 
deemed appropriate by the study physician and upon obtaining subject consent  
(note: removal itself may be performed by another clinician, such as a nurse practitioner).  Consideration of study device removal should include the following 
standard of care criteria: If the subject  has an intrauterine pregnancy in the first 
trimester and the study device is seen to be in the uterine cavity or cervix on 
ultrasound, remove the s tudy device if the retrieval threads are visible. If the 
retrieval threads are not accessible , the IUD should remain in the uterus until 
delivery (abortion or term) .  
Subjects will be counseled and followed through completion of pregnancy, and the clinical  outcome will be recorded.    
 
19. DATA MONITORING AND QUALITY CONTROL  
19.1 Monitoring of Clinical Sites and Investigators 
Periodic monitoring visits will be made at the investigational site throughout the clinical study to ensure that the Investigator obligations are fulfilled and all 
applicable regulations and guidelines are being followed. These visits will ensure that the facilities remain acceptable, the investigational plan is being 
followed, the IRB  and local authorities have been notified of approved 
investigational plan changes as required, complete records are being 
maintained, appropriate and timely reports have been made to the Sponsor 
and/or its designees and the IRB , study device and study device inventory are 
controlled and the Investigator is carrying out all agreed upon activities. The Sponsor will reserve the right to remove either the Investigator or the 
inves tigational site from the study for noncompliance with the investigational 
plan or regulations.   See monitoring plan for full details.  
19.2 Electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRF) 
Electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) will be used to collect all subject data 
during the study

2. at least one report of pregnancy status after being enrolled 
AND  
3. have at least 1 cycle of diary with intercourse and without any 
backup contraception or emergency contraception ( EC) 
OR 
4. became pregnant while VeraCept  was in place.  
Evaluable for Cycle Control (ECYC) :  all subjects Evaluable for Pregnancy with 
at least one cycle for which: A) a pregnancy did not occur; and B) there is bleeding related diary data.  
20.2 Disposition Of Subjects

CMDOC- 0008 Version 5 .0 / 19 September 2017   Confidential    Page 41 of 44 study.  Pre- trial medications include any routine medications taken within 30 
days of enrollment.  The number and percentage of subjects using medications, 
as captured on the Concomitant Medication e CRF, will be tabulated according 
to the medication’s Worl d Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Drug 
Class and Generic Term.  Pre -trial and concomitant medications will be 
presented separately.  
20.6 Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome measure is e ffectiveness and will be evaluated as  
absence of pregnancy during VeraCept use for up to 12 months. Pregnancies 
judged to have occurred while a study device was in place (determined by 
ultrasound and medical assessments) will be included in the analysis of pregnancies.  
 For the primary evaluation of effectiveness , the P earl index (and 95% 
confidence intervals) will be calculated through 12 months for cycles in subjec ts 
aged 18- 35 at the time of VeraCept  placement, excluding the following (unless 
the subject became pregnant in the cycle):  
• Cycles where back -up contraception use was documented on the daily diary  
• Cycles with no intercourse.   
• Cycles in which emergency contraception was used 
The EP population will be used for the primary evaluation of effectiveness.  
Life table analyses will be used as further assessment of pregnancies.  Secondarily the Pearl index and life table analyses will be done through 3 years.  
20.7 Safety And Other Outcome Measures  
All safety and other outcome measures will be analyzed using the ITT/Safety 
Population unless noted otherwise.  Confidence intervals will be provided to 
support interpretation of the observed safety rates. 
 
VeraCept  Characteristics 
Study device  ease of placement and placement success will be summarized.  
Cumulative study device expulsion rates will be summarized  
 
Adverse Events

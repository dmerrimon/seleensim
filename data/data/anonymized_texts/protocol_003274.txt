TITLE : Retrospective Experience of CIED Implantation with Piedmont Ath ens 
Regional Electrophysiology 
OBJECTIVE  The objective of this study is t o retrospectivel y gather inform ation on 
patients who underwent a CIED pro cedure with either a CanGaroo,  
Tyrx envelope, or no envelope.   
DESIGN  A single center will retrospect ively review up to 700 subjects who 
underwent implantation of a C IED with CanGaroo, Tyrx, or no 
envelope.  All sets of subjects en rolled will also be examined for any 
follow-up visits and/or advers e events that occurred up to 12 m onths 
post-surgery. 
STUDY 
POPULATION  Male or female patients who underwen t a CIED implantation utilizing 
CanGaroo hydrated in saline, Can Garoo hydrated in Antibiotic, T yrx, or 
no envelope. 
ENDPOINTS  The endpoints will be defined as: 
1. The incidence of major i nfection post procedure. 
2. Any pocket related issues that prompted an office visit 
CLINICAL 
PARAMETERS  The following clinical data will be collected  
 Demographic information 
 Risk factors for infection 
 Surgical procedure 
 Type of device implanted 
 Envelope soak solution used 
 Post procedure information on m ajor infections as defined 
below 
 Post procedure information on pocket related issues 
 Post procedure information on hematoma 
DURATION  Data will be collected for a minimum of one post-surgical visit  after CIED 
implant for all groups.  If more v isits are available, data fro m those visits 
will be collected up to 12 months post-procedure.

1.  Introduction and Rationale 
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This st udy is to be conducted 
according to U.S. and international standards of Good Clinical Practice in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations, International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, and 
institutional researc h policies and procedures. 
 
Broader indications for the imp lant of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) and 
population aging are the main reas ons for the continuous increa se in the use of pacemakers, 
implantable cardioverter-defibr illators, and devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy.  
The rate of infection is out of proportion to the increase in implantation rate. T his is primarily 
due to the comorbidities in CIED patients, the greater complexi ty of the devices, and the 
increased duration of procedures.1,2,3   
 
2. Study Design and Methods 
 
Clinical records will be reviewed and data collected for up to 700 subjects who underwent 
implantation of a CIED.   All sets of subjects will have data r eviewed for any visits on or 
after March 27, 2017. No subject will  be excluded from the stud y based on gender, racial, or 
ethnic origin. Patients will not  be contacted and only de-identified data will be collected. A 
waiver of Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization will be requested from the IRB.   
 
Each patient’s medical records will be reviewed by the investig ator or designated personnel 
for basic clinical data, incl uding demographic information, ris k factors for infection, 
information about the surgical procedure, type of device implan ted, and post procedure 
information on infection, pocket related issues, and hematoma information will all be 
collected for each subj ect. Data will be collected retrospectiv ely using Electronic Data 
Capture (Medrio). 
 
CIED infections are defined as (1 ) superficial cellulitis in th e region of the CIED pocket with 
wound dehiscence, erosion, or purulent drainage, (2) deep incisional or organ/space 
(generator pocket) surgical site  infection that meets the Cente rs for Disease Control and 
Prevention criteria, independent f rom time of surgery, (3) pers istent bacteremia, or (4) 
endocarditis. 
Major CIED infections are defined as a CIED infection resulting  in one or more of the 
following: 
 CIED system removal 
 Any invasive procedure (e.g., pocke t opened) without system rem oval

 Treatment with antibiotic thera py if the subject is not a candi date for system removal 
and infection recurrence after com pletion of antibiotic therapy  or evidence of deep 
infection with wound dehiscence, e rosion, or purulent drainage 
 Death 
 
Any serious adverse event that r equires a Medical Device Report will be reported by the 
Sponsor to the FDA in accordance with Sponsor’s Medical Device Reporting SOP. The site

3. Study Objectives 
 
The objective of the study is to: 
1. The objective of this study is to retrospectiv ely gather inf ormation on patients who 
underwent a CIED procedure with either a CanGaroo, Tyrx envelop e, or no envelope.   
Endpoints 
The endpoints are defined as: 1. The incidence of major post proced ure infection (as defined abo ve)  
2. Any pocket related issues that pr ompted an office visit which i nclude but are not limited 
to pain, swelling, redness, mi gration and/or hematoma 
4. Risks and Benefits 
4.1.Risks 
As this is a retrospective study, there are no physical potenti al risks to research subjects.   
There may be risks associ ated with loss of privacy. 
4.2. Benefits 
As this is a retrospective s tudy, there are no physical benefit to individual research subjects; 
however, society and physicians w ill benefit from the knowledge  gained. 
 
5. Data Analysis   
Since this is a retrospective study, analyses will consist of tabulated data and descriptive 
statistics. Subject data listi ngs and tabular and graphical pre sentations of the summary and 
statistical results will be pr ovided. Additional quantitative and qualitative comparisons will 
be made between the groups of subjects, contemporary literature , and similar studies.  
Statistical comparisons betwee n treatment groups (CanGaroo vers us Tyrx versus no 
envelope) will be performed using Fisher’s exact test or Chi-sq uare tests for categorical 
variables.  Continuous variables  will be analyzed using ANOVA.   A log rank test will be 
performed to compare the time to infection between the CanGaroo , Tyrx, and no envelope 
treatment groups at all of the follow-up visits.

6. Ethical Considerations 
6.1.Code of Conduct 
 
The Investigator will ensure tha t the clinical study is conduct ed in accordance with good 
clinical practice and a ll regulatory and institutional requirem ents, including those for 
subject privacy, informed consent, Institutional Review Board, or Ethics Committee 
approval, and record retention.   
 
6.2.Institutional Review Boar d Approval and Oversight 
 
This protocol, or any subsequent modifications, will be reviewe d and approved by an 
Institutional Review Board. A W aiver of Informed Consent and HIPAA due to the 
retrospective nature of this study will be requested. 
 
The confidentiality of the ident ity of subjects enrolled in the study and the information 
contained in their study records will be maintained. Any public ation of any data collected 
as part of this trial will onl y use de-identified data, so that identification of any individual 
subject will not be possible.   
 The records will be made availa ble as required for review by th e FDA, or other applicable 
regulatory agency and a reviewing IRB; however to the extent po ssible, the subject’s 
identity will not be disclosed.    A subject identification number will be used during data collec tion and the patient name, 
date of birth, medical record number and/or address will NOT ap pear anywhere.

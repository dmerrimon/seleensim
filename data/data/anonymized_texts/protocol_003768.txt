 1. STUDY OBJECTIVE 
 
To evaluate the ocular safety, tolerability, and efficacy of topical administration of SURF -201 
(0.2% betamethasone sodium phosphate  [BSP]  ophthalmic solution) compared with vehicle 
when dosed twice daily (BID) for 1 day prior to cataract surgery, the day of cataract surgery, and 
14 days post cataract su rgery.  
 
2. STUDY DESIGN 
 This study is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -masked, vehicle -controlled, parallel -
group clinical trial. The investigator and his/her staff will not know which study medication the subject is receiving but will be able to determine this in the event of an emergency.  
 Prior to enrollment, the study will be discussed with prospective subjects and those wishing to enter will be asked to give written informed consent. Informed consent will be obtained prior to any study related procedures being performed. Once informed consent has been obtained, the subjects will be questioned regarding their medical history to determine whether or not they are in satisfactory health to enter the study and to determine if they meet the specific entry criteria.  
 During the screening phase (Day -2 to Day - 14) of the study, subjects who meet all inclusion and 
none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio: 40 subjects in the 0.2% BSP group and 40 subjects in the vehicle group.  
 During the dosing phase (Day - 1 to Day 14), subjects will dose BID for 16 days: the day before 
cataract surgery, the day of cataract surgery, and for 14 days after cataract surgery. Subjects will 
then be followed for approximately 2 weeks during the evaluati on phase (Day 15 to Day 32).  
 There will be 7 study visits for full study participation: 1 visit during the screening phase, 3 visits (Day 0, Day 1 and Day 8) during the dosing phase, and 3 visits (Day 15, Day 22, and Day 32) during the evaluation phase.  Subjects will instill 3 doses of study drug prior to surgery (2 doses on Day -1, and 1 dose on Day 
0 prior to surgery), 1 dose in the evening after surgery and continue dosing BID for 14 days after surgery.  
 Subject safety will be evaluated throughout the study. The safety parameters to be assessed are the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuations due to AEs, changes in visual acuity (VA) and intraocular pressure (IOP), and biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic findings.   Efficacy will be assessed by biomicroscopic measurement of anterior chamber cells (ACCs) and measurement of the subject’s pain level at each visit using a visual analog scale (VAS). Subject pain will also be assessed by subjects at home using a subject diary.  
 All ratings  and procedures  should be performed  by the same examiner  from  visit to visit whenever 
possible.

This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol app roved by the IRB, and according 
to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards. No deviation from the protocol will be implemented without the prior review and approval of the IRB except where it may be necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a research s ubject. In such cases, the deviation will be reported, in writing, 
to the IRB and the Sponsor or designee as soon as possible.  4. STUDY POPULATION 
 Approximately 80 s ubjects , 18 years of age and older , who are scheduled to undergo 
uncomplicated unilateral cataract surgery (phacoemulsification or extracapsular extraction; surgery must not be performed with the aid of a femto [femtosecond] laser) and who meet all study entry criteria  will participate in th e study.  
 
4.1.Inclusion Criteria  
 The following are inclusion criteria for prospective study subjects to be confirmed at Visit 1 (Day - 14 – Day - 2) prior to randomization.  
 1. Adult  subjects , age 18 years or older , scheduled for uncomplicated unilateral cataract surgery 
(phacoemulsification or extracapsular  extraction ; surgery must not be performed with the aid 
of a femto [femtosecond] laser ) with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation.  
 2. Subjects must be a ble to understand and sign the Informed Consent Form  (ICF) . 
 3. Female s ubjects  of childbearing potential must agree to and submit a  negative urine

 6. CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
 
Contraindications : Betamethasone sodiu m phosphate  (BSP) , as with other ophthalmic 
corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most active viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also 
in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures.  
 
Warnings and Precautions : Ocular adverse reactions which may occur with SURF -201 based on 
marketed ophthalmic corticosteroids include the following:  
• Prolonged intensive use of corticosteroids may result in intra ocular pressure ( IOP) increase, 
glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, posterior subcapsular cataracts, thinning of the globe and eventual perforation, secondary ocular infection, reduced visual acuity and visual field defects, mydriasis, ptosis, epithelial punctate keratitis, and corneal calcification may occur.  
• Delayed healing - The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the 
incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, 
perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids.  
• Bacterial infections -  Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus 
increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may 
mask infection or enhance existing infection.  
• Viral infections -  Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the 
severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex).  
• Fungal i nfections - Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop 
coincidentally with long- term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in 
any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Funga l culture 
should be taken when appropriate.  
 
Special Warnings and Precautions for Use : 
• Topical corticosteroids should never be given for an undiagnosed red eye as inappropriate use 
is potentially blinding.  
• Persistent visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. 
Persistent symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances should be evaluated 
for possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical corticosteroids.  
 
Undesirable Effects :  
• Hypersensitivity reactions usually of the delayed type, leading to irritation, burning, stinging, 
itching and dermatitis.  
• Corneal calcification has been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate -
containing eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas.  
 
Overdose : Long term intensive topical use may lead to ocular corticosteroid specific cla ss effects. 
Oral ingestion of the contents of a single -dose container of SURF -201 is unlikely to lead to any 
serious adverse effects.

Drug -Drug Interactions : No topical ophthalmic drug- drug interactions are known for SURF -201. 
Corticosteroids (including betamethasone) are metabolized by CYP3A4.   Ketoconazole has been 
reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased 
risk of corticosteroid side effects.   Coadministration with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, cobicistat -containing products) may lead to increased 
exposures of corticosteroids and therefore the potential for increased risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.   (Celestone Soluspan PI, 2018 ). 
 
Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines : SURF -201 may cause transient blurring of vision 
on instillation into the eye. Patients should be warned not to drive or operate hazardous machinery unless vision is clear.  
 
7. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
 
Disallowed medications include:  
• Any corticosteroid at least 15 days before surgery and throughout the duration of the study;  
• Depot -corticosteroids in either eye at least 45 days before surgery and throughout the 
duration of the study;  
• Administration of a ny nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including but not 
limited to topical, systemic (including sleep -aids containing NSAIDs), inhaled, or irrigation 
solution at least 1 week before surgery and throughout the duration of the study, with the 
exception of aspirin, where oral doses of 165 mg/day or lower are allowed;  
• Ocular or systemic antihistamines (including sleep -aids containing an antihistamine), or mast 
cell stabilizers in either eye at least 1 week before surgery and throughout the study’s dosing period;  
• Triamcinolone in either eye at least 90 days before surgery and throughout the study’s dosing period;  
• Medications used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia throughout the duration of the study;  
• Inhaled, ingested, sublingual, transdermal or topical products containing marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) at least 1 week before surgery and throughout the study’s dosing period and for one day after the study’s dosing period ends ;  
• Systemic pain relievers, analgesics (e.g.,  pregabalin, gabapentin, opioids) 14 days before 
surgery and throughout the duration of the study;  
• Any supplement, prescribed medication or over -the-counter product that the investigator 
feels may interfere with the study parameters, including homeopathic remedies, analgesics, and pain me dication .  
 
During the study dosing period (Day - 1 through Day 14), i f the investigator determines that a  
rescue medication is necessary  due to lack of efficacy (whether at a planned study visit or at an 
unscheduled visit) , the subject should be discontinued from the study drug and the appropriate 
rescue medication prescribed . The subject should continue to be seen for all remaining study visits 
to assess safety and efficacy.  This information must be recorded in the subject’s source record and 
on the appropriate eCRF .

 8. CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS/ EXAMINATION PROCEDURES  
 
The ophthalmic examinations listed below will be conducted in the surgery eye (study eye) and in the order specified. The fellow eye (non- study eye) may be examined at the investigators’ 
discretion.   Subject  Assessment of Pain via D iary:  Surgery eye (study eye) pain will be evaluated prior to 
each study drug dos e using a pain scale included in the dosing and pain assessment diary that 
subjects complete at home.  
 Investigator Assessments  include the following:  
 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (ocular symptoms) : Eye pain/discomfort will be evaluated at 
Screening Visit 1 (Day -14 to Day - 2) and at Visit 3 through Visit 7 (Day 1 through Day 32) 
using a VAS, scoring from 0 to 100 using a mark on a 100 mm line (0 = absent; 100 = maximum).  
 Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) : BCVA will be measured at Screening Visit 1 (Day - 14 to 
Day-2) and at Visit 3 through Visit 7 (Day 1 through Day 32) (log of the minimum angle of 
resolution [logMAR] score using ETDRS [Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study] chart will be used to measure BCVA). A pinhole test may be performed at Visit 3 (Day 1).  
 Biomicroscopy : Slit lamp biomicroscopy, including the evaluation of anterior chamber cell 
(ACC) and anterior chamber flare, chemosis, bulbar conjunctival injection, ciliary injection, corneal edema, and keratic precipitates will be conducted by  a board- certified ophthalmologist at 
Screening Visit 1 (Day -14 to Day - 2) and at Visit 3 through Visit 7 (Day 1 through Day 32).  
 Ophthalmoscopy : Ophthalmoscopy will be performed at Screening Visit 1 (Day - 14 to Day- 2) 
and Visit 5 (Day 15) by a board- certified ophthalmologist. Ophthalmoscopy will be performed at 
Visit 7/Early Discontinuation Visit only if not performed at Visit 5.   Intraocular Pressure (IOP) : IOP will be measured at Screening Visit 1 (Day - 14 to Day- 2) and at 
Visit 3 through Vis it 7 (Day 1 through Day 32) in mmHg using a Goldmann applanation 
tonometer.   Standard examinations for subjects undergoing cataract surgery will be conducted by the investigator or qualified designated staff. However, ophthalmoscopy and biomicroscopy exam inations will be performed by the same board -certified ophthalmologist who performs a 
subject’s cataract surgery. All ratings and procedures should be performed by the same examiner from visit to visit whenever possible.

 Adverse Events and Concomitant Me dications:  At each study visit, subjects will be  queried for 
new adverse events  and, if applicable , previously unresolved adverse event s. Also, c oncomitant 
medications w ill be  documented. 
 
Diary : At Visit 2  through Visit 5 (Day 0 through Day 15) , subjects ’ diaries will be reviewed and 
compliance with study drug dosing and completion of pain assessments will be evaluated . 
 
9. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Throughout the course of the study, the investigator must remain alert to possible adverse events  
or untoward findings. If adverse events  occur, the first concern will be the safety of the subject. 
Appropriate medical intervention will be provided by the i nvestigator. 
 Adverse Event (AE) Definitio n: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a study drug in a clinical investigation subject, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  Adverse Event Reporting Period : The AE reporting period for this trial begins upon signing the 
ICF and ends at the completion of the subjects’ final study visit exam. All AEs reported by the subject during the course of the study, or elicited by questions from the investigator, or noted as a result of procedures carried out on the subject, during the AE -reporting period must be 
recorded by site staff in the source documents and on the AE eCRF, whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug. In addition, any known untowar d event that occurs 
subsequent to the AE reporting period that the investigator assesses as related to the study drug should also be reported as an AE.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition :
 A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is any 
untoward medic al occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening or immediately sight -threatening in the study eye (surgery eye)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or  significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 SAE Reporting: SAEs must be immediately reported (within 24 hours of awareness of the event) to designated CRO and will be clearly documented in the source documents and on the appropriate AE eCRF and SAE Report Form. The investigator  must also notify the IRB of any 
SAEs, according to the IRB’s guidelines.  Pre-existing Conditions: In this trial, a pre -existing condition (i.e., a disorder present before the 
AE-reporting period started and noted on the Systemic and/or Ocular Medical His tory Forms) 
should not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or episodes increase in frequency or severity during the AE -reporting period.

BCVA: A worsening of 3 lines or more in log of the minimum angle of resolution ( logMAR ) 
score in the study eye from baseline or any prior visit should be captured in the source documents and on the appropriate case report form  as an AE.  
 
IOP: An increase from baseline or any prior study visit of 10 millimeters of mercury  (mmHg ) in 
IOP in the  study eye should be captured in the source documents and on the appropriate eCRF as 
an AE. An IOP of 30 mmHg or higher will be reported as an SAE.  
 
Biomicroscopy : Anterior chamber cell and flare, chemosis, bulbar conjunctival injection, ciliary 
injection,  corneal edema, and keratic precipitates will be assessed in the study. Since the severity 
of these assessments will be recorded and carefully monitored during the study, worsenings do not need to be recorded as AEs unl ess the investigator judges it appropriate. Any treatment -
emergent findings (i.e., findings that were not present prior to treatment or a worsening relative to the pretreatment baseline) outside of these assessments should be recorded as an AE.  
 Ophthalmoscopy : A new finding or a significant worsening (2 units or more) from baseline 
should be recorded as an AE.  VAS: Pain/discomfort will be assessed in the study eye. Since the severity of these assessments 
will be recorded  and carefully monitored during the study, worsenings do not need to be 
recorded as AEs unless the investigator judges it appropriate.  
 AE Considerations : Addit ional exams may be scheduled  as necessary to ensure the safety of the 
subjects during the study period. Subjects discontinued due to an AE should be seen for post -
study follow -up visits, as needed. Adverse events considered related to study drug that have not 
resolved or stabilized by the final study visit will be followed during post -study follow -up visits 
at the discretion of the investigator until the incident has resolved or stabilized and will be documented in the source documents and AE eCRF. Where appropriate, additional writte n 
reports and documentation will be provided. Adverse events considered not related to study drug that have not resolved or stabilized by the final study visit will be noted as ongoing in the eCRF, followed at the discretion of the investigator, and recorded in the source documents.  Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, any complication related to pregnancy 
would be considered an AE and recorded in the source documents and, if applicable, on the AE eCRF. If an SAE is associated with the pr egnancy, the SAE should be reported on the SAE 
Report Form.  
 10. STATISTICAL A NALYS ES 
 10.1. Randomization, Stratification, and Masking  
 Eligible s ubjects will be randomly assigned to each of treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio according to 
a validated SAS® computer -generated central randomization schedule. The randomization 
schedule  contains the coded treatment assignments for each randomization number. The

 randomization plan will be based on the study design, number of treatment groups and number of 
sites.  
 The random ization is generated by a n un-masked statistician who is not affiliated with the study. 
The randomization plan is  shared with the Sponsor’s designee responsible for final clinical 
packaging and labeling to allow for proper packaging and labeling of the study drug suppl y. Access 
to the randomization code will be strictly controlled according to the Sponsor designee’s  Standard 
Oper ating Procedures  (SOPs) .  
 The randomization is not unmasked until the study is complete and the database is locked. The 
Sponsor will confirm in writing that there are no regulatory or quality issues which preclude the unmasking of the study.  Unmasking of the randomization code prior to study completion due to a m edical emergency will 
be managed in accordance with the Sponsor designee’s SOP. All unmasked cases will be fully documented. Otherwise, the study mask will remain intact.  In this double -masked study, the investigator and his/her study staff, the subject ( including 
caregiver, if applicable) and Sponsor/designee (other than as stated above) are masked to the identity of the study drug.  10.2. Efficacy and Safety Variables  
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s) : The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjec ts 
with ACC grade of 0 (cell count=0)  at Day 15. Subjects with an ACC grade of >0 at Day 15 or 
who receive rescue medication prior to Day 15 will be treated as failures. Last -observation-
carried -forward (LOCF) will be used for the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis.  
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint : The secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects who 
achieve a pain score of 0 at each post -surgical VAS (0 -100 millimeter [mm] scale) assessment 
(Days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 32).   Safety Variables : AEs, BCVA, IOP, biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic findings. 
 10.3. Analysis Populations  
 Safety Population: The safety population includes all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of the study drug. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed in the treatment group for the study drug they received.  
 Intent -to-Treat Population: The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will include all randomized 
subjects who undergo routine uncomplicated unilateral cataract surgery. Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were assigned by the randomization scheme, regardless of which study drug they receive.

 Per Protocol Population: T he per -protocol (PP) population will include all subjects in the ITT 
population who have no major protocol deviations during the study.  
 10.4. Data Handling: Handling of Missing Da ta 
 The primary efficacy analysis for the ITT population will use the LOCF method to impute missing observations due to COVID -19 or otherwise [EMA. Guideline on Missing Data in Confirmatory 
Clinical Trials [Internet]. 2010. Available from: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/missing- data-
confirmatory -clinical -trials ].  
 Partial dates and missing dates will not be imputed. Any classifications based on partial or missing dates will assume a “worse case” scenario. If a medication cannot be classified as either prior or concomitant due to missing or partial start and stop dates, it will be considered to be concomitant. If an AE cannot be classified as resolved prior to the end of the study period due to missing or partial stop dates, it will be assumed to be ongoing.  10.5. Statistical Methods : General Principles  
 All data processing, summarization and analyses will be performed using Sponsor designee’ s SAS 
Environment / Version 9.4 (or later) of the SAS
® statistical software packa ge. The principles that 
will be applied to all tables, listings and figures (TLFs) unless otherwise stated are outlined in 
Table 1.

 10.6. Efficacy  
 
10.6.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
 The primary efficacy analysis will test  for a difference in the proportion of subjects with ACC 
grade zero (0) in the SURF -201 active treatment group versus the vehicle group only at Day 15. 
An ACC grade of zero is considered to be a success, and an ACC grade >0 or the use of rescue medication prior to Day 15 is counted as a failure (as described in Section 3.1). Missing data will 
be imputed using LOCF in the ITT population only.  The test will be the z -test for proportions and will be reported with associated z -based 95% 
confidence interval (CI ). The null hypothesis is that the proportions are equal, and this will be a 
two-sided test at the alpha = 5% level. If the assumptions of the z -test are not satisfied, a Barnard’s 
exact test and exact 95% CIs will be presented.  
 10.6.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analysi s 
 The differences in the proportion of subjects who achieve a pain score of 0 on the VAS at each post-surgical assessment between SURF -201 and vehicle will be tested using a z -test for 
proportions with a 95% CI. The null hypothesis is that the proportions  are equal, and this will be 
a two -sided test at the alpha = 5% level. If the assumptions of the z -test are not satisfied, a 
Barnard’s exact test and exact 95% CIs will be presented.  
 10.7. Safety  
 
10.7.1.  Adverse Events  
 Adverse Events (AEs) will be summarized. To select events for summarization when there are multiple occurrences of an event for a subject, AEs will be sorted by severity and relationship to study drug (i.e., severity will be sorted as mild, moderate, and s evere; relationship will be sorted 
as not related and related) . 
 Adverse Events (AEs) will be coded according to MedDRA version 23.0 Update. All data will be listed and summarized in the safety population.  
 Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be defined as AEs that first occurred or worsened on or 
after the date of first dose of study drug. Treatment emergent SAEs (TESAEs) will be defined as SAEs that first occurred or worsened on or after the date of first dose of study drug.    Adverse event (AE ) summaries will be provided for the number of subjects experiencing at least 
one event overall and in each treatment group. This will be provided for all AEs, TEAEs, SAEs and TESAEs. All will be presented overall and divided into ocular and non- ocular AEs  where 
ocular events are defined as those where an eye is indicated in the eCRF form. Percentages for the subject based summaries will be calculated based on the number of subjects in the safety population.

 Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs): The per subj ect incidence of TEAEs for each system organ 
class ( SOC ) and preferred term ( PT) will be summarized. If a subject reports the same PT multiple 
times, then that subject will only be counted once for that PT. As with the PT, if a subject reports 
multiple TEA Es within the same system organ class, then the subject will only be counted once 
for that system organ class. Summaries will be further divided by ocular and non- ocular.   
 
Relationship of Adverse Events (AEs) to the Study Drug: An overall summary of AEs by 
relationship to the study drug will be presented separately for each treatment group. The relationships indicate the possibility that the study drug caused the event. The possible grades of relationships are “Not Related” and “Related”. If a subject rep orts multiple occurrences of the 
same AE, only the most strongly related occurrence would be presented for all subject level summaries. The per subject incidence of TEAEs related to study drug for each SOC, and PT for AEs related to study drug will be summ arized.  
 Severity of Adverse Events (AEs): An overall summary of AEs by severity will be presented separately for each treatment group. If a subject reports multiple occurrences of the same AE, only the most severe event will be presented for all subject level summaries. The order of severity will be “Mild,” “Moderate,” and “Severe”. The per subject incidence of severe TEAEs for each SOC, and PT will be summarized. Percentages will be calculated based on the number of subjects in the safety population.

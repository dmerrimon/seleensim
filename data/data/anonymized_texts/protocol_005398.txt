Version 5.0, 04Dec2018
Changes to the protocol are summarised below.
Synopsis and Sect ions1 through 8were modified to reduce the length of thetreatm ent 
extensio n peri od from 92 to 40 weeks. Week 54 (Visit 14) will  bethe minimum required 
time point for treatment comparisons. Study  duration will now be a minimum of 62 weeks, 
including a 2 -week screening period, a 2 -week run -in period, a 14 -week treatment period, a 
minimum 40-week treatm ent extensi on, and a 4 -week follow -up.The rationale for t his 
change is to allow subjects adequate time to transitio n to other therapies and allow 
continued co llection of safet y and efficacy  data to inform  further decisi ons regarding 
MEDI0382 doses.
Figure 1 was m odified to reduce the length ofthe treatment extensio n peri od from 92 to a 
minimum o f 40weeks. 
Table 2 and Table 3were m odified to reduce the length of the treatm ent extensio n peri od 
from 92 to a minimum o f 40weeks .All subjects must complete an end o f treatm ent
schedule of assessments .
Appendix D was modified to be consistent with the updated potential Hy’s Law/ Hy’s Law 
reporting process.
Version 4.0, 20Apr 2018
Changes to the protocol are summarised below.
Synopsis, section 3.7 (Methods for unblinding), section 8.1 (Stati stical considerat ions): 
These sections were modified to include an analysis when all subject reach 26 weeks 
treatm ent. The rati onale for introducing the 26 week analysis is to inform about efficacy at 
6 months and guide the select ion proc ess of the optimal dose regimen because the impact of 
weight loss on improved insulin sensit ivity and glucose con trol may not be adequately  
captured at 14 weeks.
Table 2, Table 3 and section 4.2.1.5 (Rescue visit): These tables and the rescue visit 
descript ion were m odified to rem ove the requi rement of bringing used/unused IP to the 
rescue visit. Subjects should continue receiving IP while receiving rescue therapy .
Secti on 4.3 (Last dose of invest igational product follow -up visit): PK sample co llection was 
added to the visit descript ion to keep consistency with Table 2 and Table 3.

3(111)Secti on 6.3.9 (Pancreat itis): This sect ion was modified to indicate more detailed 
inform ation to be collected for events of pancreat itis.
Secti on 6.3.10 (Pancreat ic carcino ma) was added to include collect ion of specific 
inform ation for events of pancreat ic carcino ma. Section 6.4 (Clinical Event Adjudicat ion) 
was updated to include pancreat ic carcino ma and thyro id neopl asmto the list of adj udicated 
events. Given the controve rsy of whether GLP -1–based therapy  increases the ri sk for 
specific malignant disease like pancreat ic carcino ma and thy roid cancer, we plan to 
adjudicate pancreat ic carcino ma and thy roid cancer in thephase IIbstudy .
Version 3.0, 05 Feb 2018
Changes to the protocol are summarised below.
Synopsis, section 1.4 (Study  design), section 3.5 (Methods for assigning treatment groups), 
section 3.7 (Methods for unblinding), section 8.1 (Statist ical considerat ions) and sect ion 
8.5.4 (Interim analysis): These secti ons were m odified to excl ude the interim analysis and 
the analysis associated with the 26 week data. Due to fast enrolment to the study , timing for 
the primary  analysis advanced so there is no longer a need for the interim analysis. 
Similarly, the separate analysis associated with the 26 week data is removed because fast 
enrolment leads to an insufficient number of subjects reaching 26 weeks at the time of the 
primary  analysis to provide satisfactory  statistical  power. 
Version 2.0, 09 Oct 2017
Changes to the protocol are summarised below.
Secti on 1.2.3.1 (Recruit ment of subjects with T2DM and a body  mass index ≥25 kg/m2), 
section 3.1 (Inclusio n criteria): This sect ion and inclusion criterion 3 were modified to 
remove the upper BMI limit for the study . The rational e is to improve rate of enrolment and 
to increase abilit y to dem onstrate si gnificant wei ght loss when incl uding subjects wi th very 
high BMI.
Secti on 1.4 (Study  design): The number of countries and participating sites was updated.
Study  flow diagram: The diagram was corrected to reflect that MEDI0382 and liraglut ide 
dosing does not depend on the time of day.
Secti on 3.1 (Incl usion criteria): The m etformin monotherapy  inclusio n criterion (#5) was 
modified to allow use of another glucose -lowering med ication for up to 2 weeks in the 2 
months prior to screening. The rationale is to improve rate of enro lment and still include 
subjects on Metformin mo notherapy  who m ay have been offered another glucose -lowering

Male or female subjects aged ≥18 y ears of age, wi th body  mass index (BMI ) ≥25kg/m2, a 
diagnosis of T2DM and inadequate blood glucose control as defined by  an HbA1c of 7.0 to 
10.5% who are on met formin mo notherapy .
Duration of treatment
Study  durati on will be a minimum of 62 weeks, including a 2 -week screening period, a 2 -
week run -in period, a 14 -week treatment period, a minimum 40-week treatm ent extensi on, and 
a 4-week fo llow-up.
Dosage and mode of administration –investigational product, oral antidiabetic agents, 
and rescue therapy
Investigational product
Invest igational product (IP) in this clinical study  protocol  (CSP) refers to either MEDI0382, 
placebo, or li raglut ide.  
MEDI0382 and placebo:
All IP will be packed into kits with supplies for 1 week treatment (8 sy ringes –7 day  supply 
and one spare sy ringe).  MEDI0382 or placebo will be administered by  subcutaneous (SC) 
inject ion once daily for the 14 -week treatm ent period and a minimum 40-week treatm ent 
extensio n.
Liraglutide: 
Liraglut ide (6.0 mg/mL, open label) as act ive drug will be administered by SC inject ion once 
daily  for the 14 -week treatment period and a minimum 40-week treatm ent extensio n using a 
3mL pen -injector.  Liraglutide should be administ ered and stored according to product -
specific and country -specific l abelling. We recognise that in so me markets the liraglut ide label 
has not been updated with the data from the LEADER trial, as so is current ly not 
recommended in pat ients with congest ive heart failure New York Heart Associat ion (NYHA) 
class III. However, based on recent data and updates to the EU summary of product 
characterist ics, which was submitted with the CTA, we plan to include patients with 
congest ive heart failure NYHA class III in our study.
Oral antidiabetic agents:
Throughout the study , subjects shoul d cont inue to administer the same type and dose of 
metformin therapy  that they  were using at study  entry .  Metformin should be administered and 
stored according to product -specific and country -specific labelling.
Rescue therapy:
Subjects who require rescue therapy  will receive open -label insulin as a preferred option.  
Subjects should cont inue receiving IP while receiving rescue therapy.

12 (111 )Statistical methods
Populations for analyses
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis set for the efficacy  evaluat ion wil l be the primary analysis 
set and will include subjects who received at least one dose of IP, and will be analysed 
according to their rando mised treatment group.  
The Per Protocol (PP) analysis set will include only treatment completers and exclude those 
with important protocol vio lation(s).  Im portant protocol  violations are those that have the 
potenti al to aff ect the resul t of the primary analysis.
The Safet y analysis set, which includes all subjects receiving at least one dose of any  study  IP, 
will be a nalysed according to the treatment they  actually  receive.  
The Pharmacokinet ic (PK) populat ion includes all subjects who received at least one dose of 
MEDI0382 and had at least one post -baseline MEDI0382 PK sample taken that is above the 
lower limi t of quantificat ion.
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical analysis methods
The co -primary efficacy endpo ints of HbA1c change an d weight change fro m baseline to 
14weeks will be co mpared between MEDI0382 and placebo arms.  For these endpo ints, an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model wit h last-observat ion-carried-forward (LOCF) 
approach to handle missing data will be used and adjus ted for treatm ent and m easurement at 
baseline.  For weight loss, the strata of screening HbA1c ( ≤8% or >8%) will be added into the 
model as a covari ate.  Analyses will be based on the ITT populat ion, which includes all 
rando mised subjects who received at l east one dose of IP.  The analysis will include the post 
IP-discontinuation data and post- rescue data for those subjects who discont inue from study 
treatm ents or are rescued, but are still fo llowed up for their scheduled visits.
Secondary  efficacy endpo ints of body  weight and HbA1c change at 26 weeks and 54 weeks 
will be analysed by ANCOVA model wit h LOCF.  For the secondary proportion -related 
endpo ints, a logistic regressio n model will be used.  These analyses will be performed for the 
ITT populat ion.  Ant i-drug ant ibody  incidence rate and titre will be tabulated for each 
treatm ent.  Individual MEDI0382 plasma concentrations will be summarised by  treatm ent and 
visit.

1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
This study  will provide efficacy  and safet y information for 3 doses of MEDI0382 compared 
with placebo and li raglutide in subjects wi th T2DM who are taking metformin.  All subjects 
will be mo nitored throughout the study  to ensure adequate glycaemic control.  Refer to the 
current IB for infor mation on the potential benefit s of MEDI0382, and an assessment of the 
potenti al and known risks.  Refer to the prescribing informat ion for the potential benefits of 
liraglutide, and an assessment of the potential and known risks.
1.4 Study design
This is a ra ndomised, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled study  with an open -label act ive 
comparator (li raglut ide) arm, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of MEDI0382 in 
overwei ght and obese subjects with T2DM.  This study  will enrol  male and female subjects 
aged ≥18 y ears, wi th a BMI ≥25 kg/m2.  Subj ects will have a diagnosis of T2DM, and 
inadequate blood glucose control as defined by an HbA1c o f 7.0% to 10.5%, and are on 
metformin monotherapy .  Approximately 750 subjects will be randomised at approximately 
150sites in approximately  8 countri es, and it is anticipated that approximately  542 subjects 
will co mplete the study , taking into account a projected annual study  drop -out rate of 15%.  
The study  has a run -in period of 2 weeks, a 14- week treatment period, fo llowed by  a 
minimum 40-week treatm ent extensi on.  
Prior to the run -in period, subjects will be consented and screened for suitabilit y.  During the 
run-in period, subjects will refrain fro m taking prohibited medications (see Section 7.7for 
details o f prohibited medicat ions), but will cont inue to take their prescribed stable dose of 
metformin for the remainder of the study .  After complet ion of run -in, subjects who are still 
eligible will be rando mised within 1 week.  Di et and exercise counselling will be provided 
from the beginning and throughout the duration of the study .  Only subjects who are treated 
with metformin monotherapy  will be enrolled; thi s will ensure that subjects with an early  
stage of T2DM are treated in this study .
To achieve the enrolment goal for the init ially planned interim analysis (see previous versio ns 
of the protocol), subjects will be rando mly assigned with a ratio of 2:2:2:1: 1 to 1 of 5 
treatm ent arm s to receive MEDI0382 at dose level of 300 μg, 200 μg, or 100 μg, placebo or 
liraglutide respectively.  After approximately the first 400 subjects have been enro lled, the 
rando misat ion rati o will be changed to 5:5:0:2:2 to fully  enrol the rem aining 350 subjects. 
Analysis will be stratified with respect to screening HbA1c ( ≤8% or >8%).  
For subjects randomised to MEDI0382 or placebo, MEDI0382 will be init iated at 100 μg, and 
dose increments may occur in 100 μg steps every  week unt ilthe predefined maintenance dose 
is reached.  Subjects and Investigators will be advised that there may be dose increments.  
During the 14- week treatment period, open -label liragl utide will  be ini tiated at 0.6 mg and up 
titrated by  an addi tional 0.6 m g wee kly unt il a stable daily dose of 1.8 mg is reached. After the 

Clinical Study Protocol

Date 04 December 2018
30 (111 )14-week treatment period, subjects will continue wit h the allocated treatment for a further 
minimum o f 40week sof extensio n treatment , after which study  treatment will end.
Subjects receiving study  treatm ent who have completed more than 40 weeks of extensio n 
treatm ent will end study  treatm ent as soon as possible, preferably at the next scheduled visit
(including IP -supply visits) , but in no case longer than 4 weeks beyo nd the next sch eduled 
visit.   
An Early  Terminati on visi t will be perform ed for subjects who discont inue treatment 
prem aturely  at any  time and for any  reason as soon as possible, but not l ater than 7 days from 
last IP dose .  A fo llow-up visit will be performed for final safet y assessments 4 weeks after 
the last dose of IP.
See Figure 1for a summary  of the study  design.  Details of assessments at each visit are 
summar ised in Table 2and Table 3.

Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
37 (111 )Subjects m ay be rescreened once, if in the opinion of the Invest igator there is a reason to 
believe they  may be eligible.  Subjects should continue to meet all inclusio n and none of the 
exclusio n criteria to qualify for re -screening.  
For the procedures for withdrawal o f incorrectly enro lled subjects, see Section 3.4.
3.3 Subject enrolment and randomisation
Invest igator(s) should keep a record, the subject screening log, of subjects who entered study  
screening.
The Investigator(s) will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent fro m the potenti al subject before any  study -specific 
procedures are performed.
2. Assign potential subject a unique enro lment number, beginning with ‘E#’.
3. Determine subject eligibilit y.  See Secti on 3.1and 3.2.
4. Assign eligible subject unique rando misat ion code.
If a subject withdraws fro m participat ion in the study, then his/her enro lment/randomisat ion 
code cannot be reused.
Randomisat ion codes will be generated by  screening HbA1c ( ≤8% or >8%) s trata and regions 
(Europe, US/Canada, Russia, Mexico).  Specific informat ion concerning the use of interactive 
voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS) will be provided in a separate manual.  Rando mised 
subjects who discontinue from IP administration will not be replaced.
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomised 
subjects
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be 
enrolled or receive IP.  There can be no except ions to this rule.  Subjects who are enrolled, but 
subsequent ly found not to meet all the eligibilit y criteria m ust not be randomised or init iated 
on treatment, and must be withdrawn fro m the study.
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -generated random 
sequence using an IVRS/IWRS.  To achieve the enrolment goal for the init ially planned 
interim analysis (see previous versio ns of the protocol), subjects will be rando mly assigned 
with a rati o of 2:2:2:1:1 to 1 of 5 treatment arms to receive MEDI0382 at dose level of 300 μg, 
200 μg, or 100 μg, placebo or liraglut ide respect ively.  After approximately the first 400 
subjects have been enro lled, the randomisat ion ratio will be changed to 5:5:0:2:2 to fully enro l 
the rem aining 350 subjects.

Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
38 (111 )3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
The study  will be conducted in a doubl e-blind fashio n for MEDI0382 and placebo.  Pre -filled 
syringes of MEDI0382 three different doses and placebo are visually  distinct from one 
another.  Clear, colourless so lutions ofMEDI0382 (0.5 mg/mL) will be supplied in 1 mL pre -
filled sy ringes containing between 0.2 mL and 0.6 mL, depending on the dose.  Buffer placebo 
will be supplied in 1 mL pre -filled syringe containing 0.3 mL.  The different fill vo lumes and 
the relative posi tion of  the pl unger rods will be visually  distinct during administration.  The IP 
kit cartons are i dentical in appearance which will be opened exclusively by  subjects, j ust 
before taking the study  drug (preferably at home).  The sponsor staff, the subjects , and the 
Invest igators invo lved in the treatment of subjects or in the clinical evaluat ion of subjects will 
not be aware of the treatment received (Internat ional Council  on Harm onisat ion [ICH] E9).  IP 
will be handled by  a desi gnated individual (IP manage r –pharmacist/study  nurse) at the study  
site who will not be involved in the management or evaluation of study  subjects.  The tasks 
will/ m ay include dispensing of IP, collection of used IP boxes along with unused doses, drug 
accountabilit y, instructing t he subject on self -administration.  This designated individual may 
also administer the IP during the subject’s on- site visi t, and answer the subject’s quest ions 
related to the IP administration.
There m ay also be a designated Site Monitor to verify  drug ac countabilit y perform ed by  
designated IP manager.
The results for fast ing plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c are blinded to the Invest igator for all 
visits except Visit s 1 to 3.  FPG and HbA1c values are blinded to the Investigator site until the 
unblinding criteria for rescue therapy  are m et.  Once the cri teria are m et, FPG and HbA1c will 
be reported to the site for an individual subject (see Section 4.2.1.4 and 4.2.2.1 ).  Previous 
values will remain blinded and the site will only  receive t he values go ing forward from the 
point the criteria were met.  However, after Week 26, during the treatment extension period, a 
different glycaemic rescue criterion has been defined for the safety o f the subjects (see Section 
4.2.2.1 ).  The central laboratory  will notify  the Investi gator to repeat HbA1c without 
provi ding an explanat ion, and if the repeated HbA1c value is at or above the defined level for 
the visit an instruction will be sent to the site by the Central Laboratory to start glycaemic 
rescue therapy  in the subject.
3.7 Methods for unblinding
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomisation for each randomised 
subject, will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacists from the IVRS/IWRS.  Routines 
for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be provided to each centre.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the app ropri ate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment randomisat ion.  The 
Invest igator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment 
given to the subject to the AstraZeneca staff.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI 0382
Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
39 (111 )AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for serious adverse events (SAEs) that are 
unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory  authori ties.  Treatm ent codes will not be broken for the 
planned analyses of data until all decisio ns on the evaluabilit y of the data from  each individual 
subject have been made and documented.
The except ion to the above is for those personnel analysing the PK samples.  The 
rando misat ion code will be provided to ensure that only samples fro m subjects who were on 
active study  treatment are analysed.  Samples from subjects not dosed with the relevant active 
study  treatm ent will only be analysed on a ‘for cause’ basis, for example, if there is suspicio n 
that a subject has b een dosed incorrectly .  The treatm ent allo cation informat ion will be kept in 
a secure l ocati on unt il the end of the study .
For the purpose of the primary  analysis and the 26 -week analysis, any study  team  members 
who serve in the unblinded analysis group wi ll stop day -to-day work on the study and other 
pre-selected personnel will take over these roles for the remainder of the trial.  The study  team  
members will remain blinded to treatment assignment until the data base lock after the 
treatm ent extensio n is finished.
3.8 Restrictions
Once screened and qualified for entry , subjects will be instructed as follows:
 Any new prescript ion medicat ions or over -the-counter preparations must be 
reported to study  site staff.  For restri ctions on concomitant medicat ions, see 
Section 3.1and Section 3.2(Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria) and Section 7
(Invest igational Product and Other Treatments).
 Continue metformin therapy at current dosage (if applicable) and at approximately 
the sam e time each day .
 Fast overnight for at least 8 hours prior to study  site visits (all except Visit s 2, 12, 
13, 15, 16, 17 and 18), ie, no food or beverage except water.
 Withhold alcohol, and refrain fro m intense exercise 24 hours prior to each study site 
visit.
 Do not donate blood for the duration of the study .
 Delay administering the morning dose of met formin therapy  (if applicable) and IP 
(as applicable) on the morning of each study  site visi t and bring anti diabetic 
medicat ion (as applicable) and IP to each study  site visit.
 Subjects should not be prescribed GLP -1 receptor agonists (Byetta®, By dureon®, 
or Vi ctoza®) or any  other GLP -1 analogs during the 4 -week safet y follow-up 
period.

40 (111 ) If a subject comes to a visit without having followed at l east one of the above 
instructi ons, then the subject should be re -scheduled for the ent ire visit (if possible 
within the allowed time -window and feasible in Investigator’s judgment).  The 
sponsor or designee should be contacted if the Investig ator i s informed of any  
restri ction vio lations.  The sponsor will decide whether a subject with restrict ion 
violations will be allowed to continue study  parti cipati on.
3.9 Discontinuation of investigational product
Subjects m ay be di scontinued from the IP in t he following situations:
 Subject decisio n.  The subject is at any  time free to discont inue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment.
 An AE that, in the opinion o f the Invest igator or the sponsor, warrants 
discontinuat ion from further dosing.
 Subje ct noncom pliance that, in the opinio n of the Investigator or sponsor, warrants 
withdrawal  (eg, ref usal to adhere to scheduled visit s).
 Pregnancy in a female subject.
 Calculated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min confirmed by repeat testing or a 
decrease in re nal funct ion that would preclude continued treatment with met formin 
according to local guidance.
 Loss of glucose control.  If any subject experiences a loss of glucose control, in 
addition to IP, the Invest igator should init iate rescue therapy  and the subj ect may  
continue study  parti cipat ion.  The Invest igator should fo llow local prescribing 
inform ation for the rescue therapy  and m ay discuss appropriate rescue therapy  with 
the AstraZeneca Medical Monitor if needed.  Subjects must first complete the 
Rescue v isit procedures before receiving open -label rescue therapy.  Rescued 
subjects judged by the Invest igator to have inadequate glycaemic control despite a 
maximum tolerated dose of rescue therapy  will be di scontinued fro m the IP and 
referred for additional an ti-hyperglycaemic therapy  (see Secti ons 4.2.1.4 and 
4.2.2.1 ).
 Subjects with a central laboratory  ALT and/or AST >3 × ULN will be scheduled for 
a follow-up visi t within 3 days fo llowing the receipt of the result (see Appendix D).  
Subjects should be discont inued fro m study  medicati on if the init ial and repeat 
laboratory  tests m eet any  of the f ollowing cri teria:
ALT and/or AST are >3 × ULN and TBL >2 × ULN
ALT and/or AST are >5 × ULN for ≥14 consecut ive days, at any time after 
initial confirmatory  resul ts

Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
41 (111 )ALT and /or AST are >8 × ULN.
 Lost to follow -up.  
Every  effort will be m ade to ensure that the subject continues to return to the clinic for study  
visits and to avoid “lost to fo llow-up” during the conduct of the study .  It is important that 
Invest igators and site staff familiarise themselves with procedu res for maintaining such 
subjects in the study  to collect their data as scheduled.  The study  staff shoul d make diligent 
attem pts to contact subjects who fail to return for study  visits by using inst itutional databases, 
subject’s health professio nals, and any other m eans that com ply wit h country  and l ocal laws 
and regulations.  After the first missed visit, subjects who are considered temporarily lost to 
follow-up will have 2 documented telephone contact attempts and 1 certified letter in an effort 
to con tact them.
Any withdrawal must be fully documented in the subject’s source records and recorded in the 
electroni c Case Report Form (eCRF).  The documentation must include the reason for the 
withdrawal  and details o f any sequelae (fo llowed unt il symptoms reso lve or improve, as 
appropriate).
If a subject is withdrawn fro m the study  during treatm ent phase, he/she must complete the 
procedures outlined in Section 3.9.1 and the sponsor should be contacted.
3.9.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a subject from investigational product
At any time, subjects are free to discont inue IP or withdraw from the study  (ie, IP and 
assessments –Secti on 3.10), without prejudice to further treatment.  A subject who decides to 
discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  The 
reasons for premature discont inuat ion of IP should be recorded in the eCRF.  If possible, the 
subject will be seen and assessed by  an Invest igator(s).  Adverse events will be fo llowed up 
(Secti on 6).  All IP should be returned by the subject.
Ifa subject discont inues from the IP, he or she should be asked, at the discretion of the 
treating physician, to return to the study  site for the Early  Terminati on Vi sit as soon as 
possible, but not later than 7 days from last IP dose.  All endpo int assessm ents m ust be 
perform ed at thi s visi t (Table 2).  The subject should also be asked to return 4 weeks (±3 days) 
after the l ast IP dose, for follow -up ass essments (see Section 4.3).  If the subject is unable or 
unwilling to return, a phone fo llow-up shoul d be conducted.
Subjects who discont inue IP wi ll be recommended to continue on the study  and f ollow the 
original  visit schedule wi thout taking IP. A follow-up vi sit shoul d be perform ed as advised by 
the study  plan.  The next visits should be planned in accordance to the original visit schedule 
(apart from the IP resupply visits). If the subject is unable or unwilling to return to the study 
site for visits according to the ori ginal  visit schedule, the subject shoul d be asked to undergo 
modified visit s and schedule (eg, less frequent visits, regular tel ephone contacts, a contact at 
study  closure, or other means).

3.10 Criteria for withdrawal
3.10.1 Screen failures
Screening failures are subjects who do not fulfil the eligibilit y criteria for the study , and 
therefore m ust not be randomised.  These subjects should have the reason for study  
withdrawal  recorded as ‘Screen failure’.  ‘Failure to meet random isation criteria’ shoul d be 
selected for an indicat ion that the subject has been unable to fulfil/satisfy  the cri teria requi red 
for assignment into a randomised group.
Given so me variabilit y in HbA1c, subjects may be eligible for re -testing of HbA1c, if deemed 
applicable by  the Invest igator.  These subjects will not be automatically listed as screen 
failures.  For such subjects the results measured as part of Screening will be replaced by a re -
test result obtained within the screening period.  For these s ubjects, the screening will be 
extended to up to 18 day s.
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study  at any time (IP and assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment.
A subject who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AEs.  The Invest igator will fo llow up AEs outside of the clinical study .  
AstraZeneca or its delegate may request invest igators to collect informat ion on subjects’ vital 
status (dead or alive; date of death when applicable) at the end of the study  from publicly 
available sources, in accordance with local regulat ions.  Knowledge o f the vital status at study  
end in all subject is crucial for the integrit y of the study .
If a subject withdraws fro m participat ion in the study, then his/her enro lment/randomisat ion 
code cannot be reused.  Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study  may be stopped if, in the judgment of AstraZeneca, trial subjects are placed at 
undue risk beca use o f clinically significant findings that:
 are assessed as causally related to IP
 are not considered to be consistent with cont inuat ion of the study
Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data available for the subject at the time of 
discontinuat ion of  follow
-up m ust be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  All reasons 
for discont inuat ion of treatment must be documented.  In terminating the study , the sponsor 
will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ int erests.

52 (111 )4.1 Screening/Enrolment period
Procedures will be performed according to the Study  Plan (Table 2).  At screening, consent ing 
subjects are assessed to ensure that they  meet eligibili ty criteria.  Subj ects who do not meet 
these cri teria must not be enrolled in the study .  Subjects will be instructed to arrive in the 
morning o f each scheduled visit.  
4.1.1 Visit 1 assessments -Screening 
The m aximum  durati on of  the screening period will be 2 weeks (fro m provi sion of informed 
consent to complet ion of screening procedures).
Each potential subject will provide written informed consent prior to any  study -specific 
procedures and undergo assessments applicable for the visit (see Table 2). Subj ects m ust si gn 
the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to any  Visit 1 procedures and prior to being instructed 
to fast or withho ld any medicat ion unless it is usual site practice to a sk all pat ients to com e to 
regul ar visit s having fasted. Registration of subject’s enrolment via IVRS/IWRS should occur 
on the day  of ICF signature.  
If a subject has not fasted, the subject will sign the informed consent, perform all non -
laboratory screening assessments, and return at least 1 day  later in a fasted state for collect ion 
of screening l aboratory  assessments.
Throughout the study , subjects will be instructed to delay administering their morning dose of 
metformin on the morning of study  site visi ts, as well  as to abstain from  strenuous exercise 
and alcoho l for 24 hours before each visit.  As above, in case such requests are not usual 
practi ce, the procedures that could potentially be affected will be rescheduled for a later day  
within the maximum durat ion of 2 weeks planned for screening.
Dem ographics data collected will include age, gender, race, and ethnicit y. Date of birth will 
be co llected if allowed by local regulat ions.  The subject’s co mplete medical history  will be 
recorded, and will include current medical condit ions, past or present, and any diseases or 
disorders.  Vi sit 1 assessments are primarily  conc erned wi th confirmat ion of the underlying 
disease state and the requisite level of severit y based on background medicat ions.  A record of 
physician -diagnosed T2DM i s requi red in source docum entation pri or to enrolment.  A 
subject’s verbal history  suggest ive of T2DM symptom s, but wi thout supporting 
docum entati on, is not sufficient to satisfy  this inclusi on cri terion.
All conco mitant m edicat ions will be recorded.  See Section 7.7for more inform ation on 
concomitant medicat ions. The abilit y of the subject to self -administer SC inject ion will be 
checked. 
A co mplete physical examinat ion will be conducted, vital signs will be measured, and a digital 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed.  Body  weight and height will be 
measured, and BMI will be calculated direct ly in RAVE.

53 (111 )Blood sam ples will be taken for laboratory  evaluati ons, including HbA1c measurements, 
calcitonin, serum  chemistry , haematol ogy, fasting blood glucose, and fast ing serum lipids.  
Urine will be collected for urinalysis, pregnancy  testing, and drug screening.  A screen for 
hepat itis and tests for HIV -1 and HIV -2 antibodies will also be performed.  
Given so me variabilit y in HbA1c, subjects m ay be eligible for re -testing of HbA1c, if deemed 
applicable by  the Invest igator.  For such subjects the results measured as part of screening will 
be replaced by a re -test result ob tained wi thin the screening period.  For these subjects, the 
screening will be extended to up to 18 day s. Addit ionally , in case of laboratory  results that are 
deem ed questi onable or unreliable by  the invest igator or if the blood sample is hemo lyzed, re -
testing is permitted.
Screening values will be used to determine if the subject is eligible for randomisat ion.  In case 
of HbA1c, as described above, the re -test val ue may  be used instead.  All samples will be 
processed by  a central  laboratory  and results will be reported back to the clinic.  Subjects will 
not be rando mised if results of any laboratory  test are abnorm al and clinically significant as 
judged by  the Invest igator or study physician.  Individuals may requalify for study enro lment 
within 2 weeks of screening fo llowing an abnorm al test resul t by having that tes t repeated 
once wi th acceptable results as judged by the Investigator and study  physician (or designee).
When all o f the screening results are available, individuals will be notified by  telephone of 
their preliminary eligibilit y status.
4.1.2 Re-screening
If the reason for screen failure was transient (including but not limited to study -supplied 
equipment failure or unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening visits), 
re-screening can be allowed only once.  All study  procedures of init ial Visit 1 mus t be 
repeated at the re -screening visit (Table 2).  Re-screened subjects should re -sign informed 
consent on the re -screening Visit 1.  If a subject is re-screened, he/she must continue to meet 
allinclusio n/exclusio n criteria.  All procedures from screening should be repeated.
The re -screening and HbA1c re -test are independent fro m one another.  Subjects who fail the 
central  HbA1c testing twice during s creening may still be re -screened within the 
recommended window but not sooner than 12 weeks (or 3 months) fo llowing the date of 
second failed test.
Re-screened subjects keep an originally assigned enro lment number.
4.1.3 Visit 2 assessments - 2-week run -in peri od
Subjects m ust com e to the clinic for Visit 2 within a maximum o f 7 day s upon com pletion of 
the screening period.  Subjects will be instructed to arrive in the morning of the visit and to 
abstain from strenuous exercise and alcoho l for 24 hours before th e visit.  Subjects should also 
delay administering their morning dose of metformin.

During Visit 2, designated IP manager/ caregiver will go through the Instructi ons for Use 
(IFU) for MEDI0382, placebo, or liraglut ide in detail.  Subjects will be trained in self -
administration of IP, disposal o f used needles, and all the other IP handling steps while they  
administer the drug at home.  Moreover, subjects will be ask ed to return the used IP kit boxes 
along wi th sharp containers and unused syringes to invest igational site at thei r next scheduled 
visit.
Moreover, subjects will receive educat ion on di et and exercise to promote weight loss and will 
be asked to refrain fro m alternative wei ght loss programmes; they  will be expected to follow 
this advice for the duration of the study  and will receive periodic educat ion updates and 
support.
During the run -in subjects will be provided with a blood gluco meter and training for it s use.  
Subjects will be asked to monitor their capillary  blood gl ucose l evels two times per day  and 
complete a di ary to record these levels while at home for the duration of run -in.  For more 
details, see Sect ion 5.3.1 .
All conco mitant m edicat ions will be reviewed and updated.  Subjects will refrain fro m taking

local treatment gui delines before a study  visit, and for two weeks fol lowing a change in 
diabetes m edicati on.  Subjects shoul d also be advised to check their blood glucose level if 
they have symptom s of hypoglycaemia (hunger, dizziness, shaking, sweat ing etc.) or feel 
unwell.  Any  blood gl ucose l evel <3.0 mm ol/L (54 m g/dL) i s considered as clinically  
significant hypoglycaemia and should be reported by  Investi gators as an AE (See Section 
6.3.8 ).  For more details, see Se ction 5.3.1 .  Rescue therapy  will be considered for any  subject 
with persistent hy perglycaemia (see Section 4.2.1.4 for more details).
4.2.1.4 Initiation of rescue medication (14 -week treatment period)
Pre-specified glycaemic criteria (see Table 4), based upon central laboratory  FPG and repeat 
confirmatory  FPG, have been established during the 14 -week treatment period, starting at 
Week 0 and up to Week 14 visits, to determine eligibilit y for open -label rescue medication.

Date 04 December 2018
58 (111 )Subjects with a central laboratory  FPG value m eeting the l ack of glycaemic control criterion 
at a pre -specified visit will be scheduled for a fo llow-up visit (within 3 to 5 days) to obtain a 
second central laboratory  FPG value and re view the subject’s gluco meter readings.  If the 
repeat central laboratory  FPG value st ill meets the cri terion, the subject m ust be rescued.
Subjects who meet rescue criteria in the 14 -week treatm ent peri od m ust fi rst com plete the 
rescue visit procedures be fore receiving open -label rescue medicat ion to ensure that important 
trial endpoint measurements are collected.
Following com pletion of the rescue visit, rescued subjects will be given open- label 
antidiabet ic rescue medicat ion (insulin or other antidiabet ic agents except GLP -1 receptor 
agonists, dipept idyl pept idase -4 (DPP4) and/or sodium -glucose co -transporter 2 inhibitors or 
metformin) to be init iated at the lowest starting dose and t itrated in accordance with the 
approved product label in the applicable country  at the di screti on of  the Investi gator, in 
addition to thei r metformin and IP.  Rescued subjects will then cont inue in the treatment 
period according to their original visit schedule.
Following init iation of open -label rescue ant idiabeti cmedicat ion, rescued subjects should be 
scheduled for titration visit s to increase their ant idiabet ic medicat ion dose, as tolerated and in 
accordance with the approved product label for that coun try and by their glycaemic response 
and as per the Invest igator’s judgment.

5.2.3 Resting 12- lead ECG
A digital 12 -lead ECG will be performed in accordance with the schedule provided in the 
Study  Plan (Table 2and Table 3).  A 12 -lead ECG will be taken in the supine position after 
the subject has been rest ing for atleast 10 minutes.  If the ECG must be performed wit h the 
subject in another posit ion (sitting, standing, etc.), the Invest igator should record the alternate 
position.  The Invest igator should date and sign the ECG tracing and record the clinical 
significa nce of any abnormal result on the tracing.  The ECGs will be interpreted by  a 
qualified physician (the Invest igator or qualified designee) at the clinical study site.  The 
ECGs will be stored at the study  centre.  ECG data and evaluation will be recorded i n the 
eCRF.  See Section 6for informat ion on reporting AEs.
5.2.4 Vital signs
Pre-dose vital signs (pulse and BP) are to be obtained in accordance with s chedule provi ded in 
the Study  Plan ( Table 2and Table 3).  Vi tal signs are to be taken prior to IP administration, 
and, if possible, before blood drawing.  Vital signs should be measured after the subject rests 
for approximately  5 minutes and wi th the subject in a sitting posit ion.
5.2.4.1 Pulse and blood pr essure
One pulse measurement will be taken after the subject has been sitt ing and rest ing for atleast 
5minutes, and before blood samples are taken. If a semi -autom atic device i s used, 
extrapol ation to 1 minute is recommended. If using manual BP measureme nts, a full sixt y 
second period for recording the pulse is required.  The pulse measurement will be fo llowed by

Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
67(111)two BP m easurements separated by  2 minutes each.  The two BP readings should be recorded.  
At Visit 1 the seated BP will be recorded two times i n both the left and the right arms.  The 
two measurements should be made in one arm before transferring the cuff to the other arm.  
The arm  with the highest m ean seated BP readings will be the one used for all subsequent 
readings throughout the study .  Blood pressure readings should be taken while the subject is in 
a comfortable seated posit ion with the arm  supported at the l evel of the heart.  All readings 
shoul d be recorded.  Ideally , BP shoul d be measured with the same machine, at the same time 
of day with a two hour wi ndow, and by the same personnel at each visit.  
At each visit, two BP measurements separated by  2 minutes each will be done.  The two BP 
readings should be recorded and entered in eCRF.
5.2.4.2 Orthostatic blood pressure
In the event that the subject experiences symptoms of dizziness or light -headedness or visual 
blurring, orthostatic BP and pulse should be co llected if deemed necessary by the Investigator.  
Supine and standing measurements should be made after the seated BP and pulse 
measurements have been made, using the same arm that was used for the seated BP 
measurements.  All readings should be recorded.  
Supine BP and pulse
The supine BP and pulse must be measured prior to the standing BP and pulse.  After the 
subje ct rests in the supine position for at least 5 minutes, supine BP and pulse will be 
determined fro m two replicate measurements ob tained 2 minutes apart.  The two readings 
must be recorded.
Standing BP and pulse
After the supine BP and pulse measurements ar e obtained, the subject will stand for 2 to 
3minutes.  After this t ime, the BP will be measured with the arm supported at the level o f the 
heart.  Standing BP and pulse will be determined from two replicate measurements ob tained at 
least 2 minutes apart. The two readings must be recorded.  If a new occurrence of previously  
absent orthostatic hypotension is demo nstrated, it should be recorded in the appropriate 
section of the CRF.  The Invest igator may consider reducing conco mitant anti -hypertensive 
medica tion to alleviate signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, without 
discontinuat ion of IP.
5.2.5 Other safety assessments
5.2.5.1 Drug -induced liver injury
Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP) and TBL should be monitored for abnormalit ies 
indicat ive of drug -induced liver injury .  Invest igators should contact the study physician if a 
subject develops a liver funct ion test abnormalit y.
Laboratory  values meet ing the criteria for Hy’s Law are to be reported to AstraZeneca as 
SAEs in the same time frame as defined for oth er SAEs.

68 (111 )A Hy’s Law case is defined as any  subject wi th an increase in AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN 
together with TBL ≥2 × ULN, where no other reason can be found to explain these increases.
Potenti al Hy’s Law cases that m eet any  of the i dentificati on cri teria spec ified in Appendix D
will require an unscheduled laboratory  draw for assessment by  the central  laboratory  (see 
central  laboratory  manual  for further instructions on appropriate laboratory  kit).  See 
Appendix Dfor further details.
5.3 Other assessments
5.3.1 Glucose measurements
Subjects will be asked to monitor blood glucose levels at the discretion of the Invest igator and 
per local treatm ent gui delines, before a study  visit, and for 2 weeks following a change in 
diabetes m edicati on (see Table 2and Table 3) to hel p in the clinical management.  The 
exception to this is during run -in, where subjects will be asked to monitor blood glucose twice 
per day  for 1 week before this visit.  Subjects should also be advised to check their blood 
glucose l evel if they  have symptom s of hypoglycaemia (hunger, dizziness, shaking, sweat ing 
etc.) or feel unwell.  Any blood glucose level <3.0 mmo l/L (54 m g/dL) is considere d as 
clinically significant hy poglycaemia and should be reported by  Invest igators as an AE (see 
Secti on 6.3.8 ).  Pharmaco logical treatm ents administered for hypoglycaemia, eg, 
dextrose/glucose tablets, glucagon etc., shoul d be recorded.  Rescue therapy  will be 
considered for any  subject wi th persiste nt hyperglycaemia.  Self -monitored pl asma gl ucose or 
blood glucose readings and hypoglycaemic events will be co llected and reviewed by the 
Invest igator.  Subjects may be expected to be educated and knowledgeable about their actions 
in case o f hypoglycaemia , but study  personnel will offer education and contact information 
during visit s.
5.3.2 Clinical outcome assessments
5.3.2.1 Calculation of BMI
Weight and height will be measured, in accordance with schedules provided in the Study  Plan 
(Table 2and Table 3).  The subject's weight will be recorded in kilograms (se e Sect ion 5.1.2
for more details); height will be recorded in cent imetres.  Body mass index will be calculated 
directly in RAVE [BMI =weight / (hei ght)2], where weight is measured in kg, and height in 
metres).
5.3.2.2 Waist circumference
For waist circumference measurement, the study  site personnel must ensure that:
 The subject stands and the examiner places a measuring tape in a horizontal plane 
around the abdo men at the l evel of the umbilicus
 The m easuring tape i s snug, but does not compress the skin, is parallel to the floor, 
and is not twisted

69 (111 ) The m easurement is taken at the end of a normal respiratory  expi ration.
 The m easurement is recorded in cent imete rs to the first decimal po int.
Waist circumference will be measured according to the schedules presented in the Study  Plan 
(Table 2and Table 3).
5.3.2.3 Retinal assessment
Standardi sed assessments of the ey es, such as dilat ed fundoscopic examinat ion/fundus 
photography  will be collected at baseline and store d in the subject’s source documentation.  If 
the subject has underlying ret inopathy , the baseline assessment will be entered also in the 
eCRF.  According to local pract ice the retina assessment may be in the form of detailed 
dilated fundoscopic examination by a heal thcare professi onal experi enced in the procedure, or 
a retinal photograph.  Where AEs associated with worsening of diabet ic eye disease are 
reported, baseline assessments of diabet ic eye disease will be reviewed.  The time window for 
baseline ret inal assessment i s 6months pri or to administration of first dose of IP if done in 
accordance to local standard requirements.

Samples will  be collected, l abelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.  
 
5.7.1 Storage, re -use, and destruction of biological samples
Samples will  be stored for a m aximum o f 15years fro m the date of the l ast subject’s last visit, 
after whi ch they  will be destroyed.  The results of this bio marker research will be reported 
either in the CSR i tself or as an addendum, or separately  in a scient ific report or publicat ion.  
The results of this bio marker research may be pooled with bio marker data from other studies 
with the IP to generate hy potheses to be tested in future research.
5.7.2 Labelling and shipment of biological samples
The Principal Invest igator ensures that samples are labelled and shipped in accordance with 
the Laboratory  Manual and the Bio logical Substance, Category B Regulations (materials 
containing or suspected to contain infect ious substances that do not meet Category A cri teria); 
see Appendix B, IATA 6.2 Gui dance Document.
Any samples ident ified as Infect ious Category A materials are not shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the subject unless agreed with AstraZeneca and a ppropri ate 
labelling, shipment, and containment provisio ns are approved.
5.7.3 Chain of custody of biological samples
A full chain o f custody  is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The Principal Invest igator at each centre keeps full traceabil ity of co llected bio logical  samples 
from the subjects while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) 
and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage a nd during use unt il 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
AstraZeneca keeps oversight of the ent ire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring o f 
study  sites, and audi ting of external laborator y providers.
Samples retained for further use are registered in the appropriate AstraZeneca bio bank during 
the ent ire life cycle.

74 (111 )5.7.4 Withdrawal of informed consent for donated biological samples
If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the sam ples will  be 
disposed of/destroy ed, and the acti on documented.  If samples are already  analysed ,
AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy  the resul ts of this research.
As collect ion of the bio logical samples is an integral part of the study , then the subject is 
withdrawn from  further study  parti cipat ion.
The Principal Invest igator:
 Ensures subject’s wit hdrawal o f informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to AstraZeneca.
 Ensures that bio logical samples from that subject, if stored at the study  site, are 
immediately  identified, disposed of /destroy ed, and the action documented.
 Ensures the organisation(s) ho lding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/de stroy ed, the 
action docum ented, and the signed docum ent returned to the study  site.
 Ensures that the subject and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.
AstraZeneca ensures the organisat ion(s) ho lding the sam ples is/are inform ed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroy ed and the act ion 
docum ented and returned to the study  site.
6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The Principal Invest igator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study are 
familiar wit h the content of this sect ion.
6.1 Definition of adverse events
An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical study  
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 
sign (eg, an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom (eg, nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not cons idered related 
to the m edicinal product.
The term  AE is used to include both serious and nonserious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in period, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered, but will for the purpose of 
this study  only be recorded from the time of first IP dose (see Section 6.3.1 ).

75 (111 )6.2 Definitions of se rious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i e, run -in, treatment, fo llow-up), that 
fulfils 1 or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -patient hospi talisat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talisat ion
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may  require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the ou tcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definit ion of an SAE, see Appendix A.
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
Adverse events will be collected from time of first IP dose, throughout the treatment period 
and including the fo llow
-up peri od, final visit (4 weeks post last dose ± 3 day s).
Serious AEs will be recorded fro m the tim e of signature of informed consent.
6.3.2 Follow -up of unres olved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment in the study are 
followed up by  the Invest igator for as long as medically indicated, but without 
further recording in the CRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request addit ional 
inform ation for any  subject wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if 
judged necessary .
6.3.3 Variables
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE:
 AE (verbat im)
 The date when the AE started and stopped
 Maximum intensit y
 Whether the AE is serious or not
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI0382
Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
76 (111 ) Invest igator causalit y rating against the IP (y es or no)
 Action taken with regard to IP
 AE caused subject’s wit hdrawal from study  (yes or no )
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for each SAE:
 Date AE m etcriteria for SAE
 Date Invest igator became aware of SAE
 AE is seri ous due to
 Date of hospitalisat ion
 Date of discharge
 Probable cause of death
 Date of death
 Autopsy  performed
 Causalit y assessment in relat ion to study  procedure(s)
 Causalit y assessment to ot her medicat ion
 Descript ion of AE
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Sect ion 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only  a limi ted degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Secti on 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between the IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ 
or ‘no’ to the question ‘ Do y ou consi der that there is a reasonable possibilit y that the event 
may have been caused by  the invest igational product?’
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance MEDI0382
Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
77 (111 )For SAEs, causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be ass ociated wi th any study  procedure, the causal relat ionship 
is implied as ‘yes.’
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix Ato the clinical 
study protocol .
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the subject or reported in response to the open question 
from the study  site staff: ‘Have y ou had any heal th probl ems since the previous visit’ , or 
revealed by  obse rvation will be co llected and recorded in the CRF.  When AEs are reported, 
the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and 
symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are 
not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded 
separately .
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from the mandated laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will  be summarised in the CSR.  
Deteri orations as co mpared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory  values, vi tal signs 
shoul d therefore only  be reported as AEs if they  fulfil any  of the SAE cri teria or are the reason 
for discont inuat ion of treatment with the IP.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.  Wherever possible, the reporting Invest igator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglo bin value).  
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggra vated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a subject shows elevat ions in liver biochemistry  may require further evaluat ion 
and occurr ences o f AST or ALT ≥3xULN together with TBL ≥2xULN may need to be 
reported as SAEs.  Refer to Appendix Dfor further instructi on on cases of increases in liver 
biochemistry  and evaluation o f Hy’s Law.
6.3.8 Hypoglycaemia
Spontaneous and clinically  significant hypoglycaemia has not been experienced in prior 
studi es wi th MEDI0382 up to a dose of 300 μg alongside met formin treatment.  
Subjects will be asked to test their blood glucose if they develop symptoms suggest ive of 
hypoglycaemia and to record specific symptoms and glucose values in the subject’s diary.  
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
78 (111 )Invest igators should fo llow local protocol s for treatm ent and follow -up of  the hy poglycaemic 
episode.  Clinically important bi ochemical hypoglycaemia defined as glucose levels less than 
3.0 mmo l/L (54 g/dL) by  the recent j oint posit ion statem ent of  the Ameri can Diabetes 
Associ ation and the European Associat ion for the Study  of Diabetes ( International 
Hypoglycaemia Study  Group 2017 ) should be reported as an AE, and both the AE and the 
hypoglycaemia eCRF pages must be completed.  
Following at l east two clinically significant bio chemical hypoglycaemia episodes (defined as a 
glucose <3.0 mmo l/L or <54 m g/dL) ari sing over a period of less than 2 weeks, down -titration 
of metformin or liraglut ide (if relevant) may be considered by the Invest igator.  In the event 
that hy poglycaemia is seen in subjects prescribed rescue medicat ion, the rescue medication 
shoul d be down -titrated first before dose reduction of eit her liraglut ide (where relevant) or 
metformin is considered.  Capillary blood glucose level readings recorded a week before a 
visit, or 2 weeks after a change in diabetes medicatio ns may be used as an adjunct to help 
guide decisio ns on dose m odificat ion of rescue medicat ion, liraglutide, and met formin.  
If the subject is no longer receiving metformin treatment and is receiving MEDI 0382 or 
placebo al one, IP di scontinuati on may  be the next step and this should be discussed with the 
study  physician.
6.3.9 Pancreatitis
Inform ation on the clinical course of the event, treatment, and relevant diagnostic, laboratory , 
or other invest igations will be co llected on the eCRF.  All SAEs of pancreat itis should be 
reported according to Section 6.5.  
6.3.10 Pancreatic carcinoma
Inform ation on the clinical course of the event, treatment, and relevant diagnostic, laboratory , 
or other invest igations will be co llected on the eCRF.  All SAEs of pancreat ic carcino ma 
shoul d be reported according to Section 6.5.  
6.3.11 Thyroid neoplasm
Brief information on the clinical course of the event, treatment, and relevant diagnostic, 
laboratory  or other invest igations will be co llected on the eCRF.  All SAEs of thyro id 
neoplasm should be reported according to Section 6.5.
6.3.12 Clinical events for adjudication
A number of clinical events (including CV events and deaths) wi ll be m onitored in the study  
popul ation and an independent adjudicat ion committee will review events.  These clinical 
events will be analysed in conjunct ion with events observed in Phase III studies and reported 
elsewhere.  For details see Sect ion 6.4.

eCRF, wi th the reacti on described as specifically  as possible.
6.3.14 Disease under study –Not Applicable
6.4 Clinical Event Adjudication
A CEA committee, blinde d to the treatm ent of  the subject, will independent ly adjudicate 
certain clinical AEs, and they will operate in accordance with the CEA Charter and Event 
Handling Manual for Sites and Monitors.  The CEA co mmit tee will  adjudicate events possibly 
related to the following:
1. All deaths:
CV death
Non-CV death
2. Cardi ac ischaemic events:
MI
Unstable angina (UA)
3. Cerebrovascular events:
Stroke
TIA
4. Hospitalisat ion for heart failure and urgent heart failure visit
5. Pancreat ic disease including pancreat ic carcino ma
6. Thyroid neopl asm
For all clinical events ident ified for adjudicat ion, the Invest igator will co mplete the 
appropriate modules of the eCRF, and provide source documentation.  In order to provide the 
independent CEA with appropriate and adequate informat ion for adj udicati on of  the listed 
events, pl ease consult the CEA Charter and Event Handling Manual for Sites and Monitors.  
These clinical events will be analysed in conjunction with similar clinical events observed in 
Phase III studies and reported elsewhere.

80 (111 )6.5 Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the 
study  procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Invest igators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 
24hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it .
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that al l the 
necessary  informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site within 
1calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately .  Investi gators or other site personnel inform 
AstraZeneca representatives of any  follow-up informat ion on a previously  reported SAE 
within 1 calend ar day , ie, immediately  butno later than 24 hours of when he or she becom es 
aware of it .
Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an autom ated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study  site staff reports an 
SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study  site staff how to proceed.  
The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca 
drug and the EU Summary o f Product Characteristics for the active comparator product 
(including any AstraZeneca co mparator.).
6.6 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of IP in excess of that specified in this 
protocol .  No specific treatment is reco mmended for an overdose.  The Invest igator will use 
clinical judgment to treat any  overdose.
 An overdose with associated AEs is reco rded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.
 An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose CRF 
module.
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timeli nes apply; see Sect ion 6.5.  
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days.

All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except for:
 Pregnancies discovered before the study  subject has received any  IP
 Pregnancies in the partner of male subjects
6.7.1 Maternal exposure
If a subject beco mes pregnant during the course of the study, IP should be discont inued 
immediately .
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicio n that the IP under study  
may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion.  Congenital 
abnorm alities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  El ective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be followed up and docum ented even if the subject 
was discont inued from the study.
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, i e, immediat elybut no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becom es aware of i t.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 
5calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.5for timeframe guidelines) and within 30 days for all 
other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outco me informat ion is available.
The PREGREP module in the CRF is used to report the pregnancy and the PREGOUT is used 
to report the outcome of the pregnancy.
6.8 Medication error
For the purposes of this clinical study , a m edicati on error i s an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca IP that either causes harm to the subject or has the 
potenti al to cause harm  to the subject.
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or subj ect.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error:
 occurred

82 (111 ) was i dentified and intercepted before the subject received the drug
 did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have l ed to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
 Drug name confusio n
 Dispensing error, eg, medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually 
given to the subject
 Drug not administered as indicated, eg, w rong route or wrong site of administration
 Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as 
a solid tablet
 Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept at room temperature when it should be stored 
in the fridge 
 Wrong subject received the medicat ion (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
 Wrong drug administered to subject (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
 Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS -including those which lead to one 
of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error
 Subject accidentally missed drug dose(s) (eg, forgot to take medicat ion)
 Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
 Subject failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging
 Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion 
in open -label studi es, even if an AstraZeneca product
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.
If an medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site

83(111)6.9 Management of investigational product -related toxicities (Dose 
reductions)
6.9.1 Tolerability 
If sympto ms of nausea and vo miting occur, subjects should be counselled about meal size and 
eating habits, notably consuming small, frequent meals four to five times a day  that are l ow in 
fat and contain only so luble fiber, avo iding carbonated beverages, alcoho l and sm oking.  If 
symptoms do not improve, it is possible to hold metformin for 3 days. Down -titration of  IP is 
not permitted.
6.9.2 Renal impairment 
For subjects who have an eGFR of 31 to 45 mL/min (inclusive) at screening and are taking an 
exist ing dose of met formin that is higher than the recommended dose for that degree of renal 
impairment, the dose of met formin should be reduced at Visit 2 in accordance with local 
guidelines on metformin prescript ion in renal impairment, or to 500 mg once daily if no 
guidance is in place.  Similarly, any subject experiencing a decline in eGFR during the study  
to 31 to 45 mL/min (inclusive) should have their dose of met formin reduced.  
For subjects who are found to have an eGFR ≤30 mL/min, the subject should undergo a repeat 
level 1 week later, and if the eGFR remains ≤30 mL/min on a second consecut ive test, the IP 
(MEDI0382, placebo, and liraglut ide) should be discontinued, but the subject should remain in 
the study  for all other study  procedures until their scheduled end of st udy.

84(111)aFinal Qualified Person certification and responsible manufacturer is AstraZeneca.
The MEDI0382 and placebo will be packed into kits enough for 1 -week treatment, supplied as 
blinded kits each containing 8 pre -filled syringes.  A unique ident ifying number will appear on 
both the sy ringes and ki t label.  
Liraglut ide (6.0 mg/mL, open label ) as act ive drug will be administered by SC inject ion once 
daily  for the 14 -week treatment period and a minimum 40-week extensi on peri od using a 
3mL pen -injector.  Liraglutide will be repacked/relabelled by AstraZeneca as applicable 
according to regulator y requi rements.
7.2 Dose and treatment regimens
The study  consists of a screening visit (Visit 1), a run -in period of 2 weeks (Visit 2), and a 
baseline visit (Visit 3), followed by a 14 -week randomised, double -blind placebo -controlled 
treatm ent peri od wi th open-label active comparator, and a minimum 40-week double -blind 
placebo -controlled treatment extensio n with open -label act ive co mparator.  
AstraZeneca or a designated representative will provide all IPs (MEDI0382, placebo, 
liraglutide).  At each visit, subj ects will receive sufficient quantit y of drug to l ast the durati on 
of time between visits.  In the event the subject loses her/his IP, the study  centre shoul d call 
into the IVRS/IWRS system to allow the system to determine the appropriate alternative kit 
identificat ion number(s) to be dispensed fro m the study  centre’s rem aining inventory .
Run-in period (Visit 2)
Subjects will receive placebo to be injected daily  for the 2 -week placebo run -in period.  A 
medically qualified staff member will demo nstrate injec tion techniques, after which the 
patient (or desi gnated caregiver) will administer the placebo inject ion.  Subjects will be 
instructed to continue taking met formin as directed during this period.
14-week treatment period (Visits 3 to 8)
At Visit 3 subjects will be rando mly assigned to 1 of the 5 treatment arms and rando mised IP 
will be dispensed.  The first day  of dosing is considered Day  1.  For subjects rando mised to 
MEDI0382 or placebo.  MEDI0382 will be init iated at 100 μg, and dose i ncrements may 
occur i n 100 μg steps every  week until the predefined maintenance dose is reached.  Subjects 
and Invest igators will be advised that there may be dose increments.  During the 14 -week 
treatm ent peri od, open l abel liragluti de will be init iated a t 0.6 mg and up titrated by  an 
additional 0.6 m g weekly until a stable daily  dose of 1.8 m g is reached.  All subjects, together 
with the open -label liraglut ide subjects inclusive, will be asked to attend all outpatient clinic 
visits, including weekly dosin g visi ts, as listed in the protocol.  For MEDI0382, placebo and 
liraglutide, the init ial doses of IP will be taken at the study  site.  Subj ects will subsequent ly 
self-administer MEDI0382 or placebo or liraglut ide at home (or have it administered by  a 
careg iver) once daily through end of treatment .

is to be self -administered by  SC inject ion at any  time of day , preferably around the same t ime 
every day , independent lyof meals.  There i s no restri ction to m etformin co -administration.  
Storage requirement for the IP kit boxes are included in the IFU.  
On weeks of scheduled study  visits, subjects should bring their IP with them to the study  site 
(subjects should be give n instructions and supplies as appropriate for IP transportation to 
ensure proper temperature control, etc.) and will self -administer MEDI0382 or placebo or 
liraglutide as directed by designated study -site personnel  (IP m anager).  If a dose of 
MEDI0382 or placebo or liraglut ide is missed, advise subjects to take it as soon as it is 
remembered unless it is almost time for the next dose, in which case subjects should skip the 
missed dose and take the medicine at the next regularly  scheduled time.  Advise subj ects not 
to take 2 doses of MEDI0382 or placebo or liraglutide at the same t ime.  Doses of MEDI0382 
or placebo are to be administered by  SC injecti on in the abdom en, and doses of liraglut ide are 
to be administered by  SC inject ion in the abdo men, thi gh, or upper arm.  The site of inject ion 
shoul d be rotated wi thin or across regions on a regular basis so that the same site is not used 
repeatedly.
If deemed necessary by  the Invest igator, IP can be stopped temporarily for up to 3 days once 
during the 14 -week tr eatment period and then re -started. In case there is a need to stop IP for a 
different time period, a discussio n with the study  physician shoul d take pl ace. Si tuations will 
be handled on a case by case basis and all decisio ns will be documented in the pati ent’s study

The Per Protocol (PP) analysis set includes only treatment completers and excludes those with 
important protocol vio lation(s).  Im portant protocol vio lations are those that have the pote ntial 
to affect the result of the primary  analysis.  Detailed exclusio n criteria for the PP popul ation 
will be specified in the SAP.  Subjects excluded from the PP analysis will be identified before 
the final database lock.  
8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 Primary efficacy endpoint
The primary  efficacy  endpoints are the change in HbA1c and percent change in body  weight 
from baseline to Week 14.
8.4.2 Secondary efficacy endpoints
The secondary  efficacy endpoints are:
 Change in HbA1c fro m baseline to 26 weeks, and 54 weeks
 Percentage of subjects achieving an HbA1c target of <7.0% after 14 weeks, 
26weeks, and 54 weeks
 Percent and abso lute change in body  weight from baseline to 14 weeks, 26 weeks, 
and 54 weeks
 Percentage of subjects achieving weight loss of ≥5% and ≥1 0% after 14 weeks, 
26weeks, and 54 weeks
8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
In general, data will be provided in list ings and tabular summaries.  Categorical data will be 
summarised by the number and percentage of subjects in each category .  Con tinuous vari ables 
will be summarised by descript ive statist ics, including mean, standard deviat ion, median, 
minimum, and maximum.  Baseline values will be defined as the last assessment prior to the 
first administrati on of  IP.  Addi tional details will be described in the SAP.
8.5.1 Analysis of primary variable (s)
The co -primary efficacy endpo ints of HbA1c change and weight change fro m baseline to 
14weeks will be co mpared between MEDI0382 and placebo arms.  For these endpo ints, an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model wit h last-observat ion-carried-forward (LOCF) 
approach to handle missing data will be used and adjusted for treatment and measurement at 
baseline.  For weight loss, the strata of screening HbA1c ( ≤8% or >8%) will be added into the 
model as a covari ate.  Analyses will be based on the ITT populat ion, which includes all 
rando mised subjects who received at least one dose of IP.  The analysis will include the post

treatm ents or are rescued, but are still fo llowed up for their scheduled visits.
8.5.2 Analysis of secondary variable(s)
8.5.2.1 Efficacy
Secondary  efficacy endpo ints of body  weight and HbA1c change at 26 weeks, and 54 weeks 
will be analysed by ANCOVA model wit h LOCF, including fixed effect and covariates of 
treatm ent, baseline measurement, strata of screening HbA1c ( ≤8% or >8%; except for HbA1c 
related analyses).  For the secondary  proporti on-related endpoints, a logist ic regressio n model 
will be used with similar fixed effect and co variates.  These analyses will be performed for the 
ITT populat ion.  
8.5.2.2 Safety
Adverse events and SAEs will be coded by  the m ost updated versi on of  the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA), and the ty pe, incidence, severit y and 
relationship to study  IP will be summarised by  MedDRA Sy stem  Organ Class and Preferred 
Term  and by treatm ent.  Adverse events leading to discont inuat ion, AEs leading to death, and 
deaths will also be summarised.  Specific AEs will be counted once for each subject for 
calculat ing percentages.  In addit ion, if the same AE occurs mult iple times wit hin a particular 
subject, the highest severit y and level  of relationship observed will be reported.  Subject -level 
data list ings of all AEs will be presented.  
Other safet y data, such as vital signs, clinical laboratory  data, ECG, and physical examinat ion 
findings will be descriptively  summarised at each time point by  treatm ent.  
8.5.2.3 Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity
Individual MEDI0382 plasma concentrations will be summarised by  treatm ent and visit.  
MEDI0382 plasma concentration at trough (C min) may be summarised by treatment and visit 
using descript ive statist ics for the MEDI0382 treatment arms.
A population PK analysis may be performed to further evaluate the PK properties of 
MEDI0382, but will not be reported in the CSR.
The immunogenicit y of MEDI0382 will be evaluated.  The number and percentage of subjects 
with confirmed posi tive serum  antibodies to MEDI0382 will be reported by treatment.  If 
possible, the incidence of ADA po sitivity will be correlated wi th the observed PK.
8.5.3 Subgroup analysis
For body  weight and HbA1c related primary  and secondary  endpoints, subgroup summary  or 
analysis by  whether a subject received rescue therapy  will be performed.  Full details o f any 
subgrou p analysis will be pre -specified in the SAP.

correctly .  The DMP will also cl arify the rol es and responsibilit ies of the various funct ions and 
personnel invo lved in the data management process.  When all data have been coded, 
validated, signed and locked, clean file will be declared.  Any  treatm ent revealing data may  
thereafter be added and the final database will be locked.
Serious adverse event reconciliation
Serious AE reconciliat ion reports are produced and reconciled with the Patient Safet y
database and/or the invest igational site.
Data associated with human biological samples
Data associated with bio logical samples will be transferred from laboratory (ies) internal  or 
external to AstraZeneca.

100(111)Appendix A Additional Safety Information
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adve rse 
event ( AE) as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would 
resul t in the subject ’s death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not m ean that had an AEoccurred i n a 
more severe form  it might have caused death (eg, hepat itis that re solved without hepat ic 
failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE , although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical 
operati ons planned befor e or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical a nd scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty, or incapaci ty but may jeopardise the subj ect or m ay requi re 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious.  
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
 Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm
 Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalizat ion
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
A Guide to Interpreting the Causalit y Question
When making an assessment of causalit y, consider t he following factors when deciding if 
there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE may  have been caused by the drug.
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix A
Drug Substance MEDI0382
Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
101(111) Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the suspect 
drug?  Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of 
the suspect drug?
 Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class?  Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
 De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the 
dose of the suspect drug?
 No al ternative cause.  The AE cann ot be reasonably  explained by another aetio logy 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
 Re-challenge experi ence.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped?  AstraZeneca wo uld not norm ally recommend or support a 
re-challenge .
 Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
 Is this a recogni sedfeature of overd ose of the drug?
 Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibili ty’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general , that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed j udgment.  Wi th limited or insufficient information in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no r easonable possibilit y.

Guidance Document
Labelling and shipment of biohazard samples
International Airline Transpo rtation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 3 
categori es.  For transport purposes, the classification of infectious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulat ions in the 46th edit ion (2005).  
Infecti ous substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category  B or Exem pt.  There 
is no di rect relati onship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs , is capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals.  Category  A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
 are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A.  Category  B pathogens are eg, hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
human immunodeficiency virus ty pes 1 and 2.  They  are assigned the following UN n umber 
and proper shipping name:
 UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
 are to be packed in accordance with UN 3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -all other materials wit h minimal risk of containing pathogens
 Clinical trial samples will fall into Category  B or e xempt under IATA regulations
 Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature 
in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
 Biological samples transported in dry  ice requi re addi tional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry -ice content
 IATA co mpliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as applicable
 Samples routinely transported by  road or rail are subject to local regulations which 
requi re that they  are al so packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way  to 
contain any  risk of infect ion or contaminat ion by using approved couriers and 
packaging / containment materials at all times.  The IATA 650 bio logical  sample 
containment sta ndards are encouraged wherever possible when road or rail transport is 
used.

106 (111 )Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
1.  Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to identify and appropriately 
report potential Hy’s Law ( PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases .  It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries.  
Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in Sect ion 5.2.5.1 of the 
Clinical Study  Protocol (CSP) .
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets PHL 
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central  and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL 
criteria coul d be m et by  an elevated alanine aminotransferase ( ALT )from a central laboratory 
and/or elevated total bilirubin (TBL )from a local laboratory .  
The Investigator will also review adverse event (AE) data (for example, for AEs that may 
indicate elevat ions in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria t o agree whether HL criteria are met.  
HL cri teria are m et if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver 
biochemistry  other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI) caused by  the invest igational 
medicinal product (I MP).  
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting serious a dverse events (
SAEs) and AE saccording to the outcome o f the review and 
assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
2.  Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT ≥ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) together with
TBL ≥ 2xULN at any  point during the study  following the start of study  medicat ion
irrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP).  
Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IP, can be found to explain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicat ing 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.  
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance MEDI0382
Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
107 (111 )For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transa minases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
3.  Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order t o identify  cases of PHL, it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
 ALT ≥ 3xULN
 AST ≥ 3xULN
 TBL ≥ 2xULN
Central laboratories being used
When a subject meets any o f thePHL ident ificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to AstraZeneca 
representative).  
The Investigator will also remain vigilant f or any  local  laboratory  reports where the PHL
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
 Notify  the AstraZeneca representative.
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  the central  laboratory without delay .
 Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  Case Report Form  (CRF) m odule(s) 
with the ori ginal  local laboratory  test resul t.
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts, the 
Invest igator will without delay:
 Determine wh ether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Section 2 Definit ions wi thin 
this Appendix for definit ion) by reviewing laboratory  reports fro m all previous visit s 
(including both central and local laboratory  resul ts)
4.  Follow -up
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria, the Investigator will:
 Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance MEDI0382
Study Code D5670C00004
Version 5.0
Date 04 December 2018
108(111) Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the CSP.
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the subject does meet PHL criteria, the Investigator will:
 Notify  the AstraZeneca representative, who will then inform the central Study  Team .
 Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the Invest igator will report the c ase as an SAE 
of potenti al Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y 
assessment ‘y es/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
 For subjects that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator is not required 
tosubmit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the subject’s condit ion.
 The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator to provide guidance and discuss and 
agree an approach for the study  subjects’ fo llow-up (including any further laboratory  
testing) and the continuous review of data.  
 Subsequent to this contact ,the Invest igator will:
 Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate 
clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as 
long as medically  indicated. Com pletes fo llow-up SAE form  as 
requi red.
 Invest igate the aetiology of the event and perform diagnostic 
investigat ions as discussed with the Study  Physician.  Thi s includes 
deciding which the tests available in the HL lab kit  shoul d be used.
 Com plete the 3 Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available.
5.  Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the bi ochemistr y abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the 
IMP, to ensure timely anal ysis and reporting to healt h authorit ies wit hin 15 calendar days 
form the date PHL cri teria were met.   The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent 
and Glo bal Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this review together with other subject 
matter ex perts as appropriate.  
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.

109(111)Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alter native explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF.
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE : upda te the previously submitted PHL
SAE and AE CRFs accordingly, with the new info rmation (reassessing event term; 
causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes .
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the I MP:
 Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes.  
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 15 cal endar day s, in obtaining the information 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
 Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for SAE 
reporting .
 Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are met.  Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.
6.  Laboratory Tests
The list below represents the standard, comprehensive list of fo llow-up tests which are 
recommended when using a central laboratory . For individual studies, the list may  be reduced 
to a subset of tests after co nsultat ion with the Hepati c Safet y Knowl edge Group.

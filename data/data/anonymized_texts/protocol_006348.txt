Title: A Double -Blind, Placebo -controlled, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) , Multiple 
Ascending Dose (MAD)  and CSF Capture Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics of (2R,6R )-Hydroxynorketamine  in Healthy Volunteers  
Sponsor:  National Institute of Mental Health  
Name of drug substance:  (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine hydrochloride  
Name of investigational drug product : (2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine  hydrochloride solution 
for injection  
Clinical Phase:  Phase 1  
Clinical Sit e: Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine  
Objectives:  
 
Primary: 
● Determine the safe dose range of ( 2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine 
● Determine the pharmacokinetics of ( 2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine administered in 
single ascending dose s 
● Determine the pharmacokinetics of ( 2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine administered in 
multiple ascending dose s 
 Exploratory : 
● Collect quantitative electroencephalography  (qEEG) data following administration  of 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine in healthy Subjects as a pharmacodynamic biomarker  ● Assess the concentration  of (2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine in cerebral spinal fluid 
(CSF) following a single IV administration  
 
Methodology/study design:  
 A 6-cohort single ascending dose (SAD) study will be conducted in healthy volunteers utilizing a slow -infusion intravenous ( IV) route of administration. Standard safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and qEEG monitoring will be evaluated at all dose levels. 
Subsequently, a 2-cohort multiple ascending dose (MAD) study will be conducted. Doses will be administered on days 1,4, 8, and 11. Standard safety parameters will be monitored, and PK  
will be evaluated at all dose levels.  
Finally, a single cohort of healthy volunt eers will receive a single dose by slow -infusion IV 
and have PK samples collected from both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
 
Study drugs, formulation, dose and route of administration:  
 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine hydrochloride will be administered intravenously over a 40-minute period as a solution in a 25 mM sodium phosphate 0.9% w/v saline solution. The SAD d oses will range from 0.1 mg/kg to 4.0 mg/kg and the investigational drug product will 
be diluted into a 5 3 mL total volume of formulant.   
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 6 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL   
Placebo will be made up of a 0.9% w/v saline solution (53 mL total volume) also administered 
via slow IV infusion over a 40-minute period.   
 
Subjects : 
 A total of 48 Subjects are planned to be enrolled in a 6-cohort SAD study (36 in the treatment groups and 12 in the control groups). All SAD cohorts will have 6 Subjects in the treatment 
group and 2 Subjects in placebo group.   
 All cohorts in the SAD study will incorporate sentinel dosing which will include 1 active and 1 placebo Subject. All  remaining Subjects will be dosed at least 24 hours after the sentinel 
cohort participants.   A total of 16 Subjects are planned to be enrolled in a 2 cohort MAD study (12 in the treatment groups and 4 in the control groups). All MAD cohorts will have 6 Subjects in the treatment group and 2 Subjects in placebo group.     A total of 6 subjects are planned to be enrolled in a 1 cohort CSF capture study. The CSF cohort will have 4 in the treatment group and 2 in the control group.   Additional cohorts (both SAD and MAD) may be enrolled if it is determined that an intermediate or higher dose level should be evaluated upon review of both safety and PK data. 
The Institutional Review Board will be notified of this revised approach. 
 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 7 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  Phar macokinetics:  
 
Serial PK blood samples will be collected during the SAD portion for each Subject receiving drug and placebo at 9 timepoints (preinfusion, end-of-infusion [approximately 40 minutes], 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and approximately 48 hr after the start of the infusion ). Pharmacokinetic urine 
samples will be collected during the SAD study for each Subject receiving drug and placebo at set intervals following the initiation -of-infusion (0-4, >4-8, >8-12, >12-24 hr). 
Pharmacokinetic urine samples (up to 3 per subject) will be collected at key time intervals (0 -
4h, >4-8h, >8-12h, >12-24h) after the start of infusion.   Serial PK blood samples will be collected for the first and fo urth (last) dosing in the MAD 
study for each Subject receiving drug and pl acebo . Blood PK samples will be obtained at 8 
timepoints (preinfusion, end-of-infusion [approximately 40 minutes], 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and approximately 24hr after the start of the infusion ). Two  PK blood samples will be collected for 
the second and third dosing in the MAD study for each subject receiving drug and placebo at approximately 10 minutes predose and at the end of the infusion.   Serial PK blood samples will be collected for the single dose CSF capture study for each Subject receiving drug and placebo. Blood PK samples will be obtained at 8 timepoints 
(preinfusion, end-of-infusion [approximately 40 minutes], 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and approximately 24hr after the start of the infusion).  CSF samples will be obtained preinfusion, and at 2 
timepoints (1h and 8 hours post infusion).   Blood and CSF samples will be analyzed for  PK of ( 2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine using a 
LC/MS/MS method to capture the following parameters: maximum plasma concentration 
(C
max), time to C max (tmax), minimum plasma concentration ( Cmin), area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve from 0 to infinity  (AUC 0-∞), area under the plasma concentration -
time curve during the dosing interval  (AUC 0-Tau), systemic plasma clearance ( CL), volume of 
distribution during terminal phase ( Vz), renal clearance ( CL R), terminal half -life (t1/2). 
 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 8 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  Safety:  
 
Safety will be assessed throughout the study. Baseline and follow-up safety assessments will include height, body mass index (BMI), weight, temperature, medical, visual and ocular history, physical examinations, ocular examinations, visual acuity, color vision tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs  (VS) , clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Columbia-S uicide Severity 
Rating S cale (C -SSRS) , the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADS S), and 
adverse events (AEs). Safety assessment s will include  AEs, ECGs, VS , clinical laboratory 
results, and physical observations. Assessment of each Subject ’s level of alertness/sedation 
will be accomplished using the Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) .  
 Evaluation of safety in the MAD study will utilize the same safety assessments used in the SAD study.   Evaluation of safety in the CSF capture study will utilize the same safety assessments used in the SAD and MAD study with the exception of the CADSS and MOAA/S assessments.  
 Monitoring of AEs will be governed by change from baselines established during prescreening and Day - 1 examinations and clinical laboratory tests. AEs will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by system organ class and preferred term, by severity, by relationship to study drug and study procedure, and by study drug dose.  Dose escalation in the SAD study or continued dosing in the MAD study may be stopped according to the predefined halting rules  or if  a Subject ’s scores demonstrate acute suicidality 
on the C- SSRS assessment or at the discretion of the study Principal Investigator and/or 
sponsor.  Determination of whether to escalate to the next dose level in the SAD study or continue dosing in the MAD will be made by the Principal  Investigator in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor and Study Sponsor.

Currently over 15 million Americans suffer from major depressive disorder ( MDD), and 
up to 40% of these patients are resistant to current first -line pharmacological therapies 
(1). Furthermore, current first line pharmacological therapies can take over 8 weeks of 
treatment before f ull alleviation of the symptoms of depression often occurs. Thus, there 
is a large unmet medical need for a fast -acting antidepressant that can also effectively 
treat those patients resistant to current pharmacological therapies .  
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine is a metabolite of the drug ketamine. Ketamine, a racemic 
mixture of R-(-)ketamine and S-(+)ketamine, is an approved anesthetic  and a World 
Health Organization ( WHO ) essential medicine ( 2). Ketamine has been  examined as a 
therapy for treatment -resistant depression  (TRD)  (3). S- (+)ketamine (SpravatoTM) has 
recently been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication . However, similar to Ketamine, S- (+)ketamine also has sedativ e, sensory 
dissociative and abuse potential. Following administration, ketamine is rapidly metabolized into over twenty characterized metabolites including (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine ( 4). (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine possesses antidepressant 
qualities in established rodent models without ketamine’s associated sedative, sensory dissociative or addictive actions ( 5). Based on this background, (2R,6R)-
Hydroxynorketamine is being evaluated in this phase 1 study to establish a safe range of exposure prior to being examined in patients with TRD.

Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 26 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 NONCLINICAL STUDIES  
At doses ranging from 5 to 125 mg/kg, (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine demonstrated acute 
and sustained antidepressant-like activity in validated murine models including the forced -swim test, novelty -suppressed feeding test, learned helplessness test , the social 
defeat/social interaction ratio , and sucrose preference tests (5). At a dose of 10 mg/kg in 
mice (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine induced an increase in hippocampus gamma-power 
(30-80 Hz) oscillations like  those noted following ketamine administration in human 
studies ( 5). In muri ne models, within this antidepressant -relevant dose range there were 
no ketamine- related adverse effects observed. These include d no change in locomotion 
activity  or rotorod coordination, no prepulse inhibition deficits  and no ketamine -like drug 
discrimina tion or self- administration (5). The antidepressant -like activity of 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine could be blocked by a dministering  a brain -penetrant 
AMPA (α -amino -3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor antagonist, 
implicating AMPA receptor involvement ( 5). (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine possessed no 
quantifiable  binding to the ketamine/MK801 site of the NMDA- type glutamate receptors 
(NMDAR)  up to 100 μM, and modest functional inhibition of the NMDA R was limited 
to high concentrations ( 5,6). For  example, at 10 μM  concentrations, (2R,6R)-
Hydroxynorketamine did not modify NMDAR- mediated field excitatory postsynaptic 
potentials in the CA1 field of mouse hippocampal slices and NMDAR- mediated 
miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents or  NMDA-evoked c urrents in CA1 pyramidal 
neurons of rat hippocampal slices ( 6). (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine protected mice from  
NMDA-induced lethality with a median effective dose ( ED
50) of 227.8 mg/kg compared 
to 6.4 mg/kg for ketamine ( 6). 
 
2.2 NONCLINICAL SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
As part of the nonclinical development of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine, key safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were conducted. Safety pharmacology studies included the central nervous system modified Irwin test, respiratory, cardiovascular, and 
human ether -á-go-go-related gene ( hERG ) evaluations. Single and repeat dose range 
finding studies preceded definitive Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) single dose and 
repeat -dose toxic ology studies in two species (rat and dog). Genetic toxicology was 
evaluated utilizing a micronucleus test i n cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes. 
An examination of neurotoxicity was conducted by evaluating the induction of neuronal vacuolation and apoptotic cell death in selected regions of the brain including the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial c ortex. All safety pharmacology and definitive 
toxicology studies were performed in accordance with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) GLP guidelines. All in vivo safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were performed utilizing an intra venous ( IV) infusion route of administration of 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine.

Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 27 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  2.3 SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY 
Central Nervous System 
Central nervous system safety pharmacology studies of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine 
were performed in male RccHan® WIST rats. Single doses of 25, 175, and 300 mg/kg were administered, and each animal was subjected to a modified Irwin assessment at 5 minutes, 1.5, 5, and 24 hours postdose. Transient changes were noted at up to 1.5 hours 
postdose for animals administered doses ≥ 175 mg/kg with the majority of findings 
evident solely at 5-minutes postdose for those rats receiving 300 mg/kg. The changes 
included decreases in measures associated with motor activity, increases in measures associated with sedation, altered respiration, and decreased body temperature. All test 
article -related changes at ≥ 175 mg/kg had resolved by the 5-hour postdose timepoint.   
 
Respiratory  
Respiratory safety pharmacology studies of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine were performed in male RccHan® WIST rats. Single doses of 25, 175, and 300 mg/kg were administered, and each animal was subject ed to head-out plethysmography for a duration 
inclusive of the infusion period through 5.5 hours postdose and 24 hours postdose. Transient changes in respiratory parameters were dose-related in magnitude and had resolved by 1.5 hours after the end of infusion. Respiration rate increases were noted for animals administered ≥25  mg/kg, with compensatory tidal volume decreases observed for 
animals administered ≥175  mg/kg. Given the compens atory differences in respiration rate 
and tidal volume, evident changes in minute volume were limited to a brief increase for animals administered 300  mg/kg. 
 Cardiovascular  
Cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine were performed in beagle dogs. Single doses of 15, 30, and 90 mg/kg were administered to telemetry -instrumented beagles and the cardiovascular function of each animal was 
assessed by qualitative or quantitative electrocardiography for a duration inclusive of the infusion period (20 minutes) through to 18 hour s after the start of the infusion . No 
qualitative or quantitative electrocardiography effects were noted over this period for all doses. Administration of 15, 30, and 90 mg/kg caused lower systolic pressure (-4 mmHg, -6 mmHg, -16 mmHg, respectively) and ar terial pulse pressure ( -2 mmHg, - 6 mmHg, -12 
mmHg, respectively) from  0.25 to 3 hours after the start of infusion. At 90 mg/kg, 
diastolic pressure and mean arterial pressure were significantly lower ( -4 mmHg and -8 
mmHg, respectively) from  0.25 to 3 hours after the start of infusion. No (2R, 6R)-
Hydroxynorketamine- related effects on heart rate or body temperature were noted 
through 18 hours after the start of infusion.  hERG  
The in vitro  effect of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine on the hERG potassium channels 
was assessed using cloned hERG expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. The HEK cells stably expressing hERG were held at -80 mV and exposed to drug treatments of 100 µM and 300 µM and onset and steady state inhibition of potass ium 
current was measured using a pulse pattern with fixed amplitudes. Each recording ended 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 28 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  with a final application of a supramaximal concentration of the reference substance (E-
4031, 500 nM) to assess the contribution of endogenous currents. The remaining uninhibited current was subtracted off -line digitally from the data to determine the 
potency of hERG inhibition. (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine inhibited hERG current by 4.3% ± 0.1% (Mean ± SEM) at 100 µM (n  = 3) and 10.3% ± 0.4% at 300 µM (n  = 3) 
versus 0.2% ± 0.6% (n = 3) in control. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50)for the inhibitory effect of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine on hERG potassium 
current was not calculated but was estimated to be greater than 300  µM.  
 2.4 TOXICOLOGY  
Range-finding toxic ol
 ogy studies 
Dose range-finding studies (single- and repeat-dose) of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine were performed in rat and dog and were supported by toxicokinetics. In rats, single doses of 150, 300, or 630 mg/kg were administered and repeat ed doses of 150 or 375 
mg/kg/dose were administered on days 1, 4, 8, 11, and 15. The 630 mg/kg single dose was the maxim um tolerated dose (MTD) with 1 animal death and 2 animals being 
sacrificed due to  morbidity. A single dose of 300 mg/kg evoked several drug related 
observations including ataxia and low carriage and dose-dependent hypoactivity and squinting eyes in females administered 150  mg/kg. In the repeated  dose study, clinical 
pathology findings secondary to hypoactivity, hemoconcentration, and a stress response were observed in rats administered ≥150 mg/kg/dose . Additionally, increased liver 
weights were noted in males administered ≥150 mg/kg/dose . Clinical effects of repeated  
doses ≤300 mg/kg/dose and 150 mg/kg/dose were considered nonadverse owing to t he 
mild severity or transient nature of the findings and the overall lack of impact on animal health and wellbeing.  
 In dogs, single doses of 45, 90 or 180 mg/kg and repeat ed doses of 90 or 180 mg/kg/dose 
were administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 15. At a sin gle dose of 180 mg/kg, test- article 
related clinical observations included ataxia and cloudy foamy vomitus. At repeat ed 
doses of ≥90 mg/kg/dose excessive salivation and ataxia were noted and emesis, vomitus, and intermittent whole -body tremors were observed in dogs administered repeat ed doses 
of 180 mg/kg /dose. Other effects observed in animals administered 180 mg/kg at both 
single and repeat ed doses were considered nonadverse owing to the mild severity and/or 
transient nature of the findings and the overall lack of impact on animal health and wellbeing.  Definitive  
 GLP toxicity  studies 
Definitive toxicology studies of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine w ere performed in two 
species (rat and dog) and were supported by toxicokinetics. Male and female rats were administered 0, 25, 175, or 350 mg/kg/dose (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25. (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine- related clinical observations for 
males included dose-dependent squinting eyes and low carriage and red discolored hair 
coat for males administered ≥ 175 mg/kg /dose and ataxia, swollen nose, and sternal 
recumbent body position (one animal) for males administered 350 mg/kg/dose. 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine- related clinical observations for females included 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 29 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  dose-dependent hypoactivity and ataxia for females administered ≥ 175 mg/kg/dose and 
squinting eyes for females administered 350 mg/kg/dose . Irregular/labored respiration 
was also noted for animals (male and female)  administered ≤ 350 mg/kg/dose and it was 
not clear whether this was related to (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine dosing. All  
observations were transient, occurred close to  tmax (1-minute postdose), generally 
resol ved by 60 minutes postdose, and did not correlate with any changes in food 
consumption or body weight; therefore, they were considered nonadverse for animals 
administered 175 mg/kg/dose. However, these findings were considered adverse for animals administered 350 mg/kg/dose due to mortality, recumbence, and minimal decrease in  male body weight/body weight gain (females experienced no change in body 
weight) . Additionally, at the terminal sacrifice, (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine- related 
increased liver weight parameters were noted in males administered 350 mg/kg /dose and 
correlated with the microscopic finding of minimal centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy. No (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine-related microscopic findings or effects on organ weight parameters were observed at the recovery sacrifice, which was consistent with reversibility. Thus, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats was determined to be 175 mg/kg/dose. This dose level corresponded to mean maximum plasma 
concentration (C
max) and AUC valu es of 150,000 ng/mL and 308,000 ng*hr/mL, 
respectively, in males and 147,000 ng/mL and 315,000 ng*hr/mL, respectively, in females on Day  25 of the dosing phase.  
 Male and female dogs were administered 0, 8, 90, or 180 mg/kg/dose (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 of the dosing phase. (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine- related clinical observations for males included 
vocalization during dosing (dose- dependent) and clear eye discharge for males 
administered ≥ 90 mg/kg/dose and ataxia and intermittent whole- body tremors for males 
administered 180 mg/kg/dose. (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine- related clinical 
observations for females included dose-dependent ataxia and vocalization during dosing 
for females administered ≥ 90 mg/kg/dos e and excess salivation, emesis, vomitus, and 
intermittent hind limb tremors for females administered 180 mg/kg /dose . (2R,6R)-
Hydroxynorketamine was associated with higher heart rate in males administered 180 
mg/kg/dose ; this effect reversed during the recovery phase. Effects for animals 
administered 180 mg/kg/dose were considered nonadverse owing to the transient nature 
of these findings and the lack of overall impact on the health and wellbeing of animals. 
Thus, the NOAEL in dogs was determined to be 180 mg/kg/dose. This dose level corresponded to mean C
max and AUC 0-72 values of 218,000 ng/mL and 316,000 
ng*hr/mL, respectively, on Day 25 of the dosing phase.  2.5 GENOTOXICITY  
A standard battery of genetic toxicology studies has been conducted on (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine in accordance with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD) Principles on GLP.  (2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine 
showed no evidence of mutagenicity in a bacterial reverse mutation test using 5 strains of Salmonella typhimurium  (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA102) and test 
concentrations of 5 to 5000 µg/plate in the absence or presence of exogenous metabolic

Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 30 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  activation  (Aroclor 1254 induced rat liver S9). An in vitro  micronucleus assay conducted 
using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and test concentrations up to 240 µg/mL 
(approximately 1 mM) showed that (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine did not induce biologically relevant increases in the frequency of micronucle ated cells following 
treatment in the absence and presence of S -9. To complete the test battery, 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine was assessed in an  in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus 
assay  using IV doses of 105, 210, or 420 mg/kg/day for 2 days. Although 1 animal given 
210 mg/kg/day was found dead at 2.5 hours post second dose, (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine showed no evidence of induction of micronucleus formation in polychromatic erythrocytes following IV  administration at up to 420 
mg/kg/day. Hence, (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine showed no evidence of mutagenic, 
clastogenic, or aneugenic activity in a standard battery of genotoxicity studies.  2.6 NEUROTOXICITY  
Although multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine is a 
weak NMDAR antago nist, it was deemed prudent to assess if  (2R,6R)-
Hydroxynorketamine induces a specified neurological toxicity involving neuronal vacuolation (referred to as Olney’s lesions) that is associated with blockade of the NMDAR. Olney’s lesion neurotoxicity studie s of (2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine were 
performed using male and female RccHan®:WIST rats. Both single and repeat -dose 
studies were performed. Single-dose studies involved doses of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine of 12, 80, 120, and 160 mg/kg. Clinical observations for (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine were consistent with those noted during the GLP toxicology studies. The validated NMDAR antagonist MK -801 was utilized as a positive control and 
dosed at 0.5 and 0.8 mg/kg via the subcutaneous (SQ) route. MK-801- related Oln ey-like 
brain lesions were observed in rats administered both these doses. No microscopic brain lesions were noted in rats administered (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine at any dose. Repeat ed dose studies employed (2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine at  12, 80, or 160 
mg/kg/dose administered 4 times over 2 weeks (days 1, 4, 11 and 15). MK-801 was again 
utilized as a positive control and dosed SQ at 0.5 and 0.8 mg/kg/dose at the same schedule (ie, 4 times over 2 weeks [days 1, 4, 11, and 15] ). Data were consistent with t hat 
obtained in the single dose study, in that Olney- like brain lesions were observed in rats 
administered both doses of MK801. In summary, no microscopic brain lesions were noted in rats administered single or repeated  doses of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine at 
any dose.  2.7 CONCLUSIONS  
Based upon multiple non clinical models of antidepressant effectiveness, there is now 
strong evidence that (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine possesses acute and sustained antidepressant -like activity akin to ketamine but without the associated ketamine- like 
adverse effects including sedation, sensory dissociation , and abuse potential . Non clinical 
toxicology studies show that there are no predicted safety pharmacology liabilities for (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine including studies explori ng the respiratory, central 
nervous, and cardiovascular  systems. There was no evidence of g enotoxicity of 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine in a standard battery of genotoxicity studies ( Ames test , in 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 31 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  vitro  micronucleus test , and rat bone marrow micronucleus test ). There was no observed 
effect of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine on the hERG potassium channels. Single and 
repeated -dose range finding and definitive (GLP) toxicology studies in rats and dogs 
established NOAEL s of 175 mg/kg/dose and 180 mg/kg/dose, respectively .  
 A neurotoxicity assessment of neuronal vacuolation (Olney’s lesions) demonstrated that there were no microscopic brain lesions in rats administered (2R,6R)-
Hydroxynorketamine at single or  repeated  doses up to 160 mg/kg. Overall, these data 
support c linical investigation of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine at the planned doses and 
schedule outlined (se e section 8.0 Study design rationale).

Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 32 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  3.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS  
The primary objective of this study is  to determine  the safe dose range and tolerability  of 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine HCl administered via a slow IV infusion (40 minutes) to 
healthy volunteers. A second primary objective for this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK)  of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine H Cl in serum following single 
and multiple dose administrations.   The exploratory objective of this study is to  collect quantitative electroencephalography 
(qEEG ) data as a PD  biomarker (SAD) . Another exploratory objective of this study is to 
assess the concentration of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine HCl  collected from 
cerebrospinal fluid following administration of a single dose (CSF capture).  
 Study endpoints include completion of all dosing levels and timepoints with full collection of all safety data, adverse events ( AEs) tabulation, clinical laboratory tests, PK  
endpoints (eg, C
max, time to C max [tmax], minimum plasma concentration [C min], area under 
the plasma concentration- time curve from 0 to infinity  [AUC 0-∞], area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve during the dosing interval  [AUC 0-Tau], systemic plasma 
clearance ( CL), volume of distribution during terminal phase [V z], renal clearance [ CL R], 
terminal half -life [t1/2]).

Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 33 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  4.0 STUDY RISKS AND BENEFITS  
As with all clinical studies, there are risks. These risks include multiple venipuncture and 
blood sample collections. The blood sample collection scheme was designed to collect 
the minimum number of blood samples to collect the needed samples for thorough 
clinical laboratory testing and that accurately and completely describe the PK of study 
drug. This minimizes the number of venipunctures and the total volume of blood collected from each Subject during the study. The amount of blood to be collected from each subject over the course of the stud y is acceptable based on the American Red Cross 
standard ( http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating- blood/eligibility -requirements ). 
 Subjects in the CSF Capture Study will also undergo lumbar puncture with placement of 
CSF catheter , a procedur e associated with risk  of bleeding, infection and post -procedure 
headache. The volume of CSF to be collected at each time point was calculated to be less than the hourly CSF production to minimize risk of headache and subjects will be kept in a semi -recumbent position while the CSF catheter remains in place. Procedures will be 
performed utilizing standard aseptic technique to minimize infection risk.  
 
Subjects will be asked to provide protected health information (PHI). All attempts will be 
made to keep PHI confidential within the limits of the law; however, there is a chance that unauthorized persons will see the subjects’ PHI. All study records will be kept in a locked file cabinet or maintained in a locked room at the Duke Early Phase Research Unit (DEPRU). Electronic files will be maintained on secure servers and transferred files with PHI will be password protected. Only people involved in the conduct, oversight, 
monitoring, or auditing of this study will be allowed access to the PHI that is collected. Any publications from this study will not use information that will identify subjects by name. Organizations that may inspect and/or copy research records maintained at DEPRU for quality assurance and data analysis include the local Institutional Review Board ( IRB) , National Institute of Mental Health  and/or their designees , and the FDA. 
 
A description of this clinical study will be available at http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as 
required by US law. This websit e will not include information that can identify subjects  
and at most, it will include a summary of the results.  
 The potential risks to the subjects enrolled in this study are moderate. To further 
minimize these risks, experienced personnel will implement  the protocol and provide 
detailed instructions to the subjects. There may be other risks, discomforts, or side effects that are currently unknown. Overall, the risks associated with the research are justified by the potential public health benefits. 
 
The primary benefit to Subjects, aside from the financial compensation, is the contribution to a study that may prove beneficial for the discovery of a new therapy for TRD.

8.1 STUDY DRUG  
The antidepressant activity of racemic ketamine and the recent approval of S- (+)ketamine  
(esketamine, SpravatoTM) have proven to be major advances for individuals with TRD. 
However, several  issues surround these drugs including unwanted side effects and the 
potential for abuse. Further, inconsistencies surround the purported mechanism of action 
(NMDAR antagonism) as other investigational drugs with optimized potency for this 
target lack cons istent antidepressant activity. There are also PD  questions given that 
ketamine is eliminated  on a timescale (hours) that is inconsistent with the effect duration 
(days). (2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine is a metabolite following ketamine administration. 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine possesses strong antidepressant activity in multiple models 
of depression and anxiety. (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine is a weak  NMDAR antagonist 
and, therefore, is devoid of unwanted side-effects including sedation, dissociation and addictive potential as tested in animal models . (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine is 
manufactured as the HCl salt which yields a single polymorph and crystal form and is stable as both a solid and as a solution in multiple formulants. The investigational drug product ( IDP) is a solution -based formulation of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine in 25 mM 
phosphate buffer.   8.2 STUDY POPULATION 
Healthy male and female adult s ubjects (18-65 years old ) will be enrolled in this study. It 
is expected that the PK  of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine in these Subjects will be 
representative of the PK  profile in patients with TRD. The cohort size in all SAD and 
MAD stages is expected to sufficiently evaluate the safety and PK of (2R,6R)-
Hydroxynorketamine . Furthermore, these cohort si zes are also expected to provide 
sufficient qEEG data to evaluate the use of qEEG as a potential PD  biomarker.  
 
8.3 DESIGN ASPECTS  
The design of the SAD, MAD and CSF Capture studies are intended to mirror the 
currently accepted best  practices for the administration of ketamine in the setting of 
depression (in MDD and TRD). Each design aspect (route of administration, IDP , PK 
measurements, qEEG data capture, etc.) should allow for direct comparison to existing clinical data on the use of ketamine as an antidepressant and should inform dose and schedule of (2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine in TRD .  
 8.4 ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION 
Racemic ketamine is being used to treat T RD in specialized clinics utilizing a slow IV 
infusion. To produce a comparati ve clinical assessment for (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine 
an identical route  of administration (ie , IV) and time frame  (40 min) is adopted.  
 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 39 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  8.5 PLANNED DOSAGE  
The doses of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine in the SAD study are based upon both the 
presumed safety ranges as defined by the definitive toxicology studies and the doses which achieve efficacy in various models of depression and anxiety. Efficacious doses of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine achieved in mouse models of antidepressant efficacy  and 
qEEG gamma changes range from 5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. The commonly used dose of 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal (IP) achieve d a mouse plasma C
max of 2,587 ng/mL and plasma 
AUC of 772  ng*hr/mL. The human equivalent dose is 0.813 mg/kg utilizing an 
allometric scaling factor of 12.3. Adjusting for the bioavailability of IP dosing (approximately 50%), the human IV dose estimate can be corrected to 0.406 mg/kg.   The (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine NOAEL  in rats is 175  mg/kg/dose. The human 
equivalent dose is 28.2 mg/kg utilizing an allometric scaling factor of 6.2. This dose level corresponded to mean C
max and AUC values of 150,000 ng/mL and 308,000 ng*hr/mL, 
respectively, in males and 147,000 ng/mL and 315,000 ng*hr/mL, respectively, in females on Day  25 of the dosing phase. The (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine NOAEL in 
dogs is 180 mg/kg/dose. The human equivalent dose is 100 mg/kg utilizing an allometric scaling factor of 1.8. This dose level corresponded to mean C
max and AUC 0-72 values of 
218,000 ng/mL and 316,000 ng*hr/mL, respectively, on Day 25 of the dosing phase. The human equivalent dose is 100 mg/kg utilizing an allometric scaling factor of 1.8.

A second approach was applied for human dose estimation based on PK  data of 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine postketamine doses in humans using validated methods (7-9). Ketamine and its major metabolites were quantified in plasma after IV infusion at  
0.5 mg/kg of racemic ketamine. A parent- metabolite PK model was developed for 
racemic -ketamine and its major metabolites including rac -norketamine , rac-
dehydronorketamine and (2S,6S:2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine, and the model parameters were estimated using a stepwise approach. The estimated model parameters for (2S,6S:2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine was assumed to be the same as those for (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine to establish these estimations. Concentration of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine was predicted at different dose levels post a 40 min infusion and 
the exposure was calculated. Based upon these methods, i t was determined that an IV 
dose of 0.1 mg/kg in human could provide similar exposure as observed in mouse post 10 
mg/kg IP dose.   
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 40 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  Based upon these collective models, t he (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine proposed doses 
for the SAD study range from 0.1 mg/kg to 4.0 mg/kg. Dose escalations between cohorts 
are approximately 2 -fold increases between coh orts in alignment with common phase 1 
clinical trial practice. The highest proposed SAD dose of 4.0 mg/kg is approximately  7X 
lower than the NOAEL human equivalent dose in the most sensitive species (rat) and 25X lower than the NOAEL human equivalent dose in the less sensitive species (dog) using allometric scaling factors of 6.2 and 1.8, respectively.   The (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine doses selected for the MAD portion are set at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg. These doses are deemed acceptable for inclusion in the MAD study based on 
the PK , PD, safety , and tolerability outcomes obtained from the SAD section  study. 
 The ( 2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine doses selected for the CSF Capture  portion are set at 
0.25 and 2.0 mg/kg. These doses are deemed acceptable for inclusion in the CSF Capture study based on the PK , PD, safety , and tolerability outcomes obtained from the SAD 
section  study. 
 8.6 PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATION 
Blood samples will be obtain ed during the study for measurement of 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine plasma concentrations to provide an unambiguous 
association between drug dose and systemic drug exposure. Serial PK  blood samples will 
be collected during the SAD and MAD studies for each Subject receiving drug and placebo at 9 timepoints and 20 timepoints, respectively. For PK  assessments, there will 
be an acceptable blood collection window of ± 5 minutes in the first 8 hours after a dose 
and ± 30 minutes thereafter.  
 Serial PK  blood samples will be collected during the SAD portion for each Subject 
receiving drug and placebo at 9 timepoints (preinfusion, end-of-infusion [approximately 40 minutes] , 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and approximately 48 hr after the start of the infusion ). 
Pharmacokinetic urine samples (up to 3 per Subject) will be collected during the SAD study for each Subject receiving drug and placebo at set intervals following the initiation -
of-infusion (0 -4, >4-8, >8-12, >12- 24 hr).  
 Serial PK  blood samples will be collected for  the first and fo urth (last) dosing in the 
MAD study for each Subject receiving drug and placebo. Blood PK samples will be obtained at 8 timepoints (pre infusion, end-of-infusion [approximately 40 minutes], 1, 2, 
4, 8, 12, and approximately 24 hr after the start of the infusion ). Two  PK blood samples 
will be collected for the second and third dosing in the MAD study for each Subject receiving drug and placebo at preinfusion and end-of-infusion [approximately 40 minutes] timepoints.   Serial PK  blood samples will be collected during the  CSF Capture  portion for each 
Subject receiving drug and placebo at 8 timepoints (pre infusion, end-of-infusion 
[approximately 40 minutes], 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and approximately 24 hr after the start of the infusion). CSF  samples will be collected during the CSF Capture  portion for each Subject 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 41 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  receiving drug and placebo at 3 timepoints (pre infusion, 1, and approximately 8 h r after 
the start of the infusion).  
 Blood and CSF samples will be stored and shipped to LabCorp (Covance) c entral 
laboratories who will perform PK  analysis of ( 2R,6R) -Hydroxynorketamine using a 
LC/MS/MS method to determine plasma concentration levels in order to calculate  the 
following PK parameters: C
max, tmax, Cmin, AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-Tau, CL, V z, CL R, t1/2. 
 8.7 SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY EVALUATIONS  
A series of safety assessments will be employed to assess drug -related AEs  and assess 
tolerability  in the study described in sections 12.8  and 13.1. Preclinical toxicology studies 
did not identify any anticipated or toxicology issues and, therefore, standard phase 1 study safety  assessments will be employed. Given the nature of the planned indication 
(TRD) and the relationship  of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine to ketamine, 4 s pecialty 
assessments will be included (ie , the Profile of Mood States [ POMS ], the Columbia-
Suicide S everity Rating S cale [C- SSRS], the Clinician Administered Dissociative States 
Scale [ CADS S], and the Modified O bserver’s A ssessment of Alertness/ Sedation 
[MOAA/S ]) as described in s ections 12.8 and 13.1.  
 Monitoring of AEs will be governed by change from baseline established during prescreening and Day - 1 examinations and clinical laboratory tests  as described in 
sections 12.9  and 13.1. The AEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and 
summarized by system organ class (SOC)  and preferred term, by severity, by relationship

Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 47 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  Dose Escalation Halting Rules 
The PI must review the following criteria before  dose escalation:  
• SAD: A review of all available safety data for the cohort to Day 3 demonstrates 
that the study halting criteria described below have not been met. 
• MAD: A review of all available safety data to Day 12, at a minimum, 
demonstrates that the dose- escalation halting criteria described below have not 
been met.  
If any of the following dose escalation halting rules are met in either the SAD or MAD 
parts, escalation to the next planned dose cohort will not proceed until all available study data have been reviewed by the PI , the Medical Monitor and the Study Sponsor: 
• Any subject develops an SAE . 
• Any subject experiences a Grade 3 (severe) AE . 
• 2 or more subjects in a cohort experience a Grade 2 (moderate) or greater AE that 
is of the same type (preferred term) and occurring in the same SOC.  
 
Individual Halting Rules 
The following individual halting rules pertain to the MAD study only: 
• Any SAE.  
• Any other condition that the site PI judges to unduly increase the risk to the 
subject. 
 
Sentinel Halting Rules  
The following are SAD sentinel halting criteria, ie, if any are met, the rest of the cohort 
will not be dosed until reviewed by the PI , the Medical Monitor and the Study Sponsor: 
• Any subject develops a Grade 3 (severe) AE within 24 hours of study drug administration .  
 If stopping rules are triggered for any reason , the study PI  will notify the Medical Monitor 
and the Study Sponsor  and initiate a review that may include unblinding of treatment 
assignments.  A summary of the decision making for all halts will be documented and 
submitted to the IRB.  
In the event that any of the stopping criteria are triggered, the PI  in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor and Study Sponsor may take one of the following courses of action. 
 
1. Temporarily halt dosing while the event is investigated.  
2. Declare the prior tested dose level as the MTD.   
3. Recommend repeat dosing at the same level.  
4. Recommend dosing at an intermediate level.  
5. Recommend protocol amendment to increase Subject safety.

not dosed in a cohort (eg, alternates or because a cohort is filled) may be rescreened as 
needed to participate in future cohorts.  
12.3 INFORMED CONSENT  
Each Subject must give written consent according to local requirements after the nature 
of the study has been fully explained. The consent form must be signed before performance of any study- related activity. The consent form that is used must be 
approved by both the sponsor and by the reviewing IRB and be in a language that the Subject can read and understand. The informed consent should be in accordance with Principals that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and sponsor policy.  Before enrollment in the study, the PI  or an authorized member of the investigational staff 
must explain to potential Subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study, and any discomfort participation in the study may entail. Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate 
will not affect the care the Subject will receive. Finally, they will be told that the 
Investigator will maintain a Subject identification register for the purposes of long- term 
follow up if needed and that their records may be accessed by health authorities and authorized sponsor staff without violating the confidentiality of the Subject, to the extent permitted by the applicable law(s) or regulations. By signing the informed consent form, the Subject is authorizing such access, and agrees to allow his or her study physician to recontact the Subject for the purpose of obtaining consent for additional safety 
evaluations, if needed.  The Subject will be given sufficient time to  read the informed consent form and the 
opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study, consent should be appropriately recorded by means of the Subject’s personally dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the signed informed consent form must be given to the Subject.

Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 52 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  12.4 SUBJECT ASSIGNMENT AND CHECK -IN 
For the SAD part, 48 Subjects (6 cohorts of 8 Subjects) will be dosed according to the 
Time and Events Schedule for the SAD study ( Table 1 ). For the MAD part, 16 Subjects  
(2 cohorts of 8 Subjects) will be dosed according to the Time and Events Schedule for the MAD study ( Table 2 ). For the CSF Capture  part, 8 Subjects ( 1 cohorts of 8 Subjects) will 
be dosed according to the Time and Events Schedule for the CSF Capture  study ( Table 
3). Additional cohorts may be enrolled after evaluation if it is determined that intermediate or higher dose levels should  be tested. The number of Subjects planned is 
considered sufficient to charact erize the safety and PK  in a first- in-human clinical trial. 
Each Subject will receive an assigned treatment based on the randomization schedule prepared by the clinical site.   Subjects in the SAD study will be randomized to receive either a single dose of  active 
drug or a single dose of matching placebo. Subjects in the MAD study will be 
randomized to receive either a series of 4  doses of active drug or a series of 4  doses of 
matching placebo. Subjects in the CSF Capture  study will be randomized to receive either 
a single dose of active drug or a single dose of matching placebo.   For Subjects in the SAD study, the maximum duration of the study from screening to end-of-study will be approximately 33 days. For Subjects in the MA D study, the 
maximum duration of the study from screening to end-of- study will be approximately 
52 days. For Subjects in the CSF Capture  study, the maximum duration of the study from 
screening to end -of-study will be approximately 33 days.  
 For the SAD , MAD and CSF Capture parts , an appropriate number of alternates will be 
included as judged by the PI . Alternates not used in a cohort may be dosed in future 
cohorts if eligibility criteria are re -confirmed .  
 At check -in (Day -1), Subjects will be admitted to the research center at an appropriate 
time the Day before study drug administration to ensure a minimum 8-hour fast prior to dosing. At check- in, all Subjects will be evaluated to confirm that they continue to meet 
all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. An alcohol breath test will be performed. A urine sample will be collected to screen for drugs of abuse and cotinine. If at any time an alcohol, cotinine, or drug test is positive, the Subject will be discontinued  
from study participation. A positive point-of-care drug test may be sent for confirmation to the clinical laboratory at the discretion of the Investigator (eg, suspicion of a spurious value).  All Subjects will be asked to confirm that they still adhere to the contraceptive criteria, and each Subject’s response will be documented.  
 A urine sample from each female Subject will be collected for a urine pregnancy test at check in. This test must be negative for the Subject to continue in the study. If an assessment is performed at both screening and Day -1, the Day - 1 assessment will be 
considered baseline. The following additional assessments will be performed on Day -1.

12.5 FASTING, MEALS , AND BEVERAGES  
An optional meal , snack , and/or beverage will be served  on the evening of check- in. All 
Subjects will then be required to fast for at least 8 hours before drug infusion, during the drug infusion and for 1 hour after the start of the infusion . The Subjects will  be provided 
a light meal from 1 hour after the start of the infusion  to 2 hours after the start of the 
infusion. Subjects will be allowed up to 240 mL of water from one hour before until one hour after drug treatment. At all other times, Subjects will be allowed to drink water ad libitum.  
 All other meals will be provided at appropriate times thereafter. Meal/snack menus will be approximately the same for all cohorts.  
  
12.6 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
All Subjects and clinical staff, (except the unblinded pharmacist staff) will be blinded to treatment. An unblinded pharmacist staff will be required at the Clinical Site to comply with the study’s randomization and blinding requirements. At the clinical site, prior to study administration, the PI  will be responsible for designating a qualified pharmacy staff 
to service as the unblinded pharmacy staff in the study. Unblinded pharmacy staff may dose Subjects, but may not participate in Subject assessments.  
 The designated, unblinded pharmacy staff will be responsible for all drug accountability issues, in cluding preparing, labelling, and dispensing study drug and placebo in 
accordance with the randomization codes provided, yet remain independent of all Subject assessments. The pharmacy staff will follow the Standard Operating Procedures and Work instructio ns related to pharmacy services and protocol- specific requirements.  
 Randomization codes will be provided to the unblinded pharmacy staff. Confirmation of receipt of the randomization code will be required by the Sponsor. The unblinded pharmacy staff will be responsible for maintaining the blind, consistent with protocol 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 54 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  design, throughout the study. All documentation is to be filed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Access to this manual will be restricted to the unblinded pharmacy staff.  
 The Subjects, PI , and all other study personnel involved with the Subject assessments 
will be blinded to the actual treatment assignment of the Subjects. The PI  will be 
ultimately responsible for ensuring the integrity of the blind, and that it is maintained through the study.   The treatment assignment should only be unblinded at the clinic in the case of dose-
limiting toxicity or emergency when the knowledge of the study drug assignment is necessary for the clinical management or welfare of the Subject. Breaking the blind at the clinic under any other circumstance will be considered a protocol violation. The PI  is 
strongly encouraged to contact the sponsor before unblinding the study drug assignment. If the blind is broken for any reason, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor within one day. In addition, the Investigator will record the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment for that Subject in the source documents and appropriate case report form page(s).   12.7 DRUG PREP ARATION, DOSING , AND ADMINISTRATION  
The IDP  and placebo will be prepared according to the Pharmacy Manual (general 
description below and provided in the Study Drug Information ( section 11).   
 The dose of IDP  will be prepared based upon the specific dose level of the cohort and the 
Subjects body weight. The exact dose will be prepared by diluting the IDP [a 10 mg/mL solution of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine Hydrochloride] with buffered vehicle [25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7) buffer in 0.9% (normal) saline].  12.8 SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING

  VS will be monitored according to the Time and Events Schedule for the SAD study 
(Table 1 ), MAD study ( Table 2 ), and CSF Capture Study (Table 3) and will include 
blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration, and temperature. The PI or designee will verify the 
eligibility of each Subject with out-of-range VS  and document approval prior to dosing.  
 Systemic blood pressure and pulse will be continuously monitored throughout drug administration and for  2 hours after the conclusion of study drug infusion. M onitoring of 
these parameters will be accomplished with a correct -sized finger cuff placed on either 
the index or middle finger and the Nexfin noninvasive continuous blood pressure monitor.  The ECG me asurements , collected in triplicate,  will be monitored using a 12- lead ECG 
signal according to the Time and Events Schedule for the SAD study ( Table 1 ), MAD 
study ( Table 2 ) and CSF Capture study (Table 3). During the collection of the baseline 
ECGs, Subjects should be in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television or cell 
phones). Subjects should rest in a recumbent position for at least 5  minutes before ECG 
collection and should refrain from talking or moving arms or legs. Baseline ECG recordings should be taken at a time independent of blood sampling or VS  measuremen ts.  
 Subjects will be instructed to tell the study physician and/or research personnel of any AEs that occur at any time during the study. Subjects will be monitored for AEs from 
dose administration through the end-of-study. 
 
For both the S AD and M AD parts , each Subject’s level of alertness/sedation and mental 
state will be examined using 4 standard tests (ie , the MOAA/S, the POMS, the C- SSRS 
and the CADSS). The MOAA/S  is a scale developed to measure the level of alertness in 
subjects who may be sedated ( see Appendix #1) . The POMS is a psychological rating 
scale used to assess transient, distinct mood states (see Appendix #2).  The C -SSRS is a 
low-burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was developed to assess severity and track suicidal events through any treatment ( see Appendix #3).  The 
CADSS  is an instrument for the m easurement of present -state dissociative symptoms (see 
Appendix #4).   For the CSF Capture study, only the POMS and C-SSRS surveys will be 
administered.   These measures will be completed according to the Time and Events Schedule for the SAD part ( Table 1 ), MAD part ( Table 2 ) and CSF Capture part (Table 3) . 
 Medical emergency personnel trained in advanced cardiac life support will be on si te to 
monitor Subjects during the confinement period in the research center. Emergency medical equipment including but not limited to intubation equipment and pulse oximetry shall be maintained on site to administer appropriate medical care if required. Procedures will be completed as specified in this protocol unless contraindicated due to a reported AE.

12.9 ADVERSE EVENTS  MONITORING AND REPORTING  
Subjects will be monitored for any AEs from study drug administration until the end- of-
study. These will include a full assessment of abuse- related AEs. The Investigator or 
designee will review each event. The Investigator or designee will assess its relationship to the study drug. Each sign or symptom will be graded for severity and the date and t ime 
of onset, cessation, and resolution will be recorded. Treatment of any adverse reactions will be evaluated and managed by the PI , a designated physician or appropriate 
emergency responders, as appropriate. All nonserious AEs will be reported on a regul ar 
basis, or as specified by the Sponsor.   An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without judgement to causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
 
A life -threatening AE/life -threatening suspected adverse r eaction, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, places the Subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an adverse reaction that, if it had occurred in a more severe form, may have caused death.  
 A serious adverse event  (SAE) or seri ous suspected adverse reaction in the view of either 
the Sponsor or the PI , results in any of the following outcomes. 
 
1. D
eath . The death was the outcome of the AE. Date will be included, if known. 
2. Life-threatening AE . The Subject was at substantial risk of dying at the time 
of the AE, or continued use of the Clinical Trial Material may have resulted in 
the death of the patient. 
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
Emergency room visits that don’t result in admission to the hospital should be evaluated for other serious outcomes. 
4. Disability or permanent damage.  A
  substantial disruption in a person’s ability 
to conduct normal life function. For example, the AE resulted in a significant, persistent, o r permanent change, impairment, damage, or disruption in the 
patient’s body function, body structure, physical activities, and/or quality of life. 
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect. Exposure to Clinical Trial Material prior to 
conception or pregnancy that ma y have resulted in adverse outcomes for the 
child.  
6. Other serious and important medical events. Events that do not fall into the 
above categories but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent other outcomes. For example, allergic 
bronchospasms requiring emergency room treatment, seizures, or convulsions 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 58 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependence or 
drug abuse. 
All serious adverse event (SAE) reporting will adhere to the U.S. Code  of Federal 
Regulations (21 CFR Part 312.32) for IND drugs. The PI will immediately report any SAEs 
to the sponsor, whether or not these are considered study intervention -related, including 
those listed in the protocol or investigator brochure; any such report must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event.  The PI or designee must send all SAEs on a MedWatch form to the Sponsor, copying the REGSupportORSC@nih.gov inbox at the time of awareness (within 24 hours for deaths, within 48 hours for all other SAEs). Additional information to include in the MedWatch Form 3500A is as follows:  
 
• IND Number  
• Protocol Number 
• Principal Investigator’s Name  
• Event Attribution  
The sponsor or designee will be responsible for determining if an SAE is reportable to the FDA as an IND Safety Report, i.e. the event is considered a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR). The study sponsor will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other applicable regulatory agency, of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected AE as soon as possible, but in no case later than seven 
calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. In addition, the sponsor must notify the FDA and all participating investigators of an Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.  
 All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution. All AEs will be documented on appropriate study records, including case report forms and AE tracking logs. A ll AEs will 
be provided in aggregate to the sponsor upon request and no less than once a year.   
 
An unexpected AE is defined as an AE or suspected  adverse reaction that is not listed on 
the PI ’s Brochure or is not listed at the severity indicated. If the IB is not available, an 
unexpected AE is one that is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  The PI  or designee will notify the appropriate sponsor contact immediately after SAE 
detection, observation, or report of occurrence, regardless of relationship to test article.   Serious AE reports should contain the following details.  
A. Study name/number. 
B. Study Drug. 
C. Investigator details (name, phone, e- mail). 
D. Subje ct numbers.

A. Sensory test (pinprick and vibration) 
B. Motor examination, reflexes and assessment of coordination (neurological 
exam)  
C. Vital signs  
D. Additional blood and/or CSF samples may be obtained, at the discretion of the investigator.  
E. Day 30 (+/- 3 days) phone follow up.  
Any new SAE that occurs within one month after the last dosing in the study and is 
considered to be related to the investigational product should be recorded and reported immediately to the Sponsor. The person responsible for this study shall take care that this study has been carried out in accordance with pharmacovigilance local regulations.  All serious  AE reporting will adhere to the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 
Part 312.32) for IND drugs (15-D ay alerts). The IRB will be notified of the alert reports 
per FDA regulations. All AEs including SAEs will be followed to resolution when possible. All AEs and treatment administered will be recorded on the case report form. The sponsor will be responsible for reporting and processing any SAEs to the FDA or other applicable regulatory agency.  Abuse- related AEs will be reported separately and include a case narrative. Case 
narratives will include the time of onset and duration of the event, dose of drug taken, severity,  and outcomes . A pharmacokinetic analysis will also be performed to assess if an 
abuse- related AE correlates with drug exposure.  
 The relationship between the AE and investigational product (IP) will be determined by the PI  based on his or her clinical judgement and the following defini tions.  
 Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product 
administration and cannot be reasonably explained by the Subject ’s clinical state or other 
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 60 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  factors. The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product 
administration and represents a known reaction to the drug under study or other drugs in its class or is predicted by the known pharmacological properties of the drug.   Not Related : The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from study 
product administration or can be reasonably explained by the Subject ’s clinical state or 
other factors.  
 Pregnancies : Pregnancies will be documented and followed until birth or another 
outcome. Pregnancies will not be reported as AEs. However, if at any time the pr egnancy 
outcome falls under the scope and definition of a SAE, it will be reported as such.  12.10 QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (qEEG) MONITORING 
AND REPORTING  
Scalp -recorded EEG will be collected  on all Subjects in the SAD study for  approximately 
1 hour immediately preinfusion, for 1 hour after the start of the infusion and for a 
subsequent hour following a 1 hour break (ie , collecting EEG data during hours 2→ 3 
after the start of the infusion ; total of 3 hours recording after the start of dosing). Du ring 
this time, there will be three, 10 -minute intervals specifically dedicated to collecting 
‘clean’ resting -state (5  minutes) and visual-evoked- potential (5 minutes) . The remainder 
of the session will entail passive recording of the EEG during other study activities.   
 High -definition EEG will be acquired through a 64-channel Brain Products actiCHamp  
systems using active electrodes positioned according to an equidistant spacing, covering the whole head from slightly above the eyebrows to below the inion. The  EEG leads will 
include horizontal and vertical electrooculography, which will be used to identify and remove periods of ocular artifact during postprocessing of the data. The EEG leads will be placed in a nylon fabric EasyCap. Prior to recording data, a thorough impedance check of the electrodes will be done to ensure high- quality recording . During the drug infusion, 
subjects will remain in a recumbent position with their head slightly raised.  
Approximately 40 minutes prior to infusion, as well as at approximately 40 and 160 minutes after the start of the infusion, participants will perform 10 minutes of dedicated EEG activities. To begin, the subject  will be cued to undergo a 5-minute routine in which 
they stay comfortably in a recumbent position with their eyes closed and relax . This 
interval will allow for capture of “clean intervals” from which to derive time -frequency, 
and spectral power measures.  Immediately following this , subjects will perform a brief, 
5-minute visual evoked potential paradigm in which they passively view a contrast -
reversing checkerboard stimulus alternating  pseudo-randomly at  approximately 0.5 Hz.    
 Subjects will spend the bulk of the remainder of the EEG recording time in a recumbent position. In the event subjects must leave the bed, the recording file will be paused, the EEG head cap will remain on the participant’s he ad while cables that connect to the 
amplifier will be ejected and clipped to the participant’s shirt to allow free movement. Once the participant returns, the cables will be inserted back into the amplifier, a brief impedance check will be done to ensure high-quality recording, and recording will then continue. Additional details of the EEG are in the MOP.  
Phase 1 Evaluation of 2R,6R -Hydroxynorketamine   National Institute of Mental Health  
Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 61 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL   
The N ational Institutes of Health  Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology 
Branch will receive the collected data. The data will undergo epoch-by-epoch visual artifact correction/rejection. Quantitative EEG analysis will only be carried out if a minimum of 30 seconds of waking, artifact free data are available for any resting -state 
scan. The data will undergo Laplacian transformation to produce curr ent density 
estimates. The current density data will undergo spectral analysis via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with boxcar windowing to generate power estimates in the following frequency bands: delta (2-7Hz), theta (7-9Hz), alpha (9- 12Hz), beta (12- 30Hz) , and 
gamma (30 -60Hz). This will be carried out with the LORETA software. At each voxel 
(n=2394; voxel resolution=7 mm3), current density will be computed as the squared magnitude of the intracerebral current density within each of the 5 frequency bands (unit: amperes per square meter, A/m
2). Current density estimates will be intensity -normalized 
to unity and log- transformed before statistical analyses. This will be carried out in 2 -
second segments and averaged over the available artifact -free, waking dat a. These data 
will be used to estimate resting -state EEG current density. The primary qEEG outcome 
will be EEG gamma current density. Resting state EEG current density estimates in other frequency bands will be analyzed to evaluate the specificity of possi ble findings. 
Exploratory analysis for patterns of EEG activity that are predictors and correlates of outcome will be carried out using EEG power in all bands derived from all the electrodes, employing principal components analysis.   
12.11 BLOOD AND CSF  DRAWS FOR CLINICAL LABORATORY AND 
PHARMACOKINETIC TESTING  
Blood and CSF draws for serial PK  and clinical laboratory testing will be collected at 
defined timepoints within the SAD, MAD and CSF Capture parts according to the 
schedule of assessments and procedures ( Tables 1 , 2 and 3, respectively ) and as described 
in section 8.6 .   
 Blood  will be stored and shipped to a LabCorp (Covance) central laboratory who will perform PK analysis of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine using a LC/MS/MS method to 
capture the following parameters: C
max, tmax, Cmin, AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-Tau, CL, V z, CL R, t1/2.  
CSF samples will be analyzed  at NIH using an alternate LC/MS/MS method assessing 
total (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine concentrations at 3 collection timepoints (predose, 1-
hr postdose and 8-hr postdose).  Subjects must have consented to participate before the screening blood draw. Blood draws collected for PK  and clinical laboratory testing will be comprised of a total of 
approximately 16 mL from each Subject. Blood draws collected only for clinical laboratory testing will be comprised of a total of approximately 11 mL from each 
Subject. Blood draws collected for only  PK testing will be comprised of a total of 
approximately 5 mL from each Subject. The maximum amount of blood draw (cumulatively) for any Subject will be approximately 219 mL.   Blood draws collected for clinical laboratory testing will include 4.5 mL for chemistry panel, 4 mL for hematology panel, 2.7  mL for coagulation panel, and 8.5 mL for serology

Detailed summaries of the statistical analysis plan for 1) all safety data; 2) all PK ; and 3) 
all qEEG data  will be prospectively described in a Statistical Analysis Plan section of the 
MOP.  
 13.1 SAFETY DATA  
All investigational product and protocol procedure related  AEs will be listed, and if the 
frequency of events allows, safety data will be summarized usi ng descriptive 
methodology.  Each incidence of investigational product and protocol procedure related AEs will be presented by severity and by association with investigational product as perceived by the PI. Symptoms /AEs  reported to occur prior to study entry will be distinguished from those 
reported as new or increased in severity during the study. All AEs and  symptoms will be 
classified by the most suitable term using the MedDRA and summarized by SOC and preferred term, by severity, by relationship to study drug and study procedure, and by study drug dose.  The number of investigational product- related SAEs will be reported.  
 Safety parameters that will be assessed include clinical lab parameters, VS, and ECG 
parameters.  The parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive 
statistics.  Additional analysis will be performed if warranted upon review of the data.  
 13.2 PHARMACOKINETICS DATA  
Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates will be calculated by standard noncompartmental 
methods of analysis.  The following PK parameters will be calculated as appropriate and if possible depending on actual samples collected : C
max, tmax, Cmin at the end of the dosing interval after each 
dose in the MAD study, area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 0 to time of 
last measurable sample ( AUC 0-last) and area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
from 0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞) in the SAD study, area under the plasma concentration -time 
curve during the dosing interval (AUC 0-Tau) after the first dose and the last dose in the 
MAD study, CL, CL R, Vz, t1/2, and accumulation ratio for C max (RC max) and AUC (0-∞) 
[RAUC (0-∞)]. 
 Renal clearance will be calculated as the ratio of amount excreted/AUC.  This will be 
compared to the unbound glomerular filtration rate, which is estimated using creatinine clearance.  Dose proportionality will be evaluated using a regression analysis model to assess the 
linear relationship between the exposure parameters (C
max and AUC 0-∞ or AUC 0-last from 
the SAD study; C max and AUC 0-Tau from the MAD study) and dose as a covariate after

Protocol Ref. #: HNK -378227- 03 Page 66 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL  log-transformation (Ln) of the data, according to the equation Ln (exposure 
parameter)  = β0  + β1  × Ln (dose); dose proportionality will be  established if the 
estimated values of the slope (β1) are  close to 1 and the 95% confidence intervals for the 
dose-dependent parameters include the value of 1 ( 12). 
 An assessment of steady state will be performed using trough concentrations (C
min) from 
days 4, 7, 10, and 12 in the MAD study. The ratio of geometric mean of C min on each 
corresponding day, divided by the geometric mean of the pooled C min from the following 
days will be calculated  according to established methods ( 13, 14) . The first assessment 
timepoint with a calculated C min ratio that does not statistic ally differ from a value of 1 
will be defined as the timepoint at which steady state is achieved  (13, 14).  
 An interim PK analysis is planned after cohorts 1 and 2 of the SAD study to assess drug exposures. Additional interim PK analyses may be performed based on the results of the interim analyse s performed following cohorts 1 and 2. Details of the interim PK analysis 
will be described in the PK Analysis Plan . 
 13.3 qEEG DATA  
Quantitative EEG (qEEG) data will be obtained for all study subjects in the SAD cohorts. 
This data will be collected over approximately 3 hours with predefined resting- state and  
visual evoked potential intervals . Analysis of the EEG data will include preliminary 
artifact correction using PCA -based techniques to identify biological artifacts that are not 
attributed to cortical activity. This will include scrutiny of the component spectral and spatial profiles, ult imately eliminating components that present with nontypical cortical 
activity. The qEEG parameters that will be studied include the ones discussed below. Other qEEG parameters may be evaluated postacquisition and will be described in the Statistical Analys is Plan.  
 Relative spectral power  
An FFT analysis will be performed on the raw EEG.  From  this FFT analysis, the absolute 
and relative power spectrum will be determined across all frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma).   Visual evoked  
 time-locked data 
Analysis of sensory processing will be conducted through consideration of the visual evoked potential to a contrast reversing checkerboard. Time -locked, event -related 
potential will be calculated on the continuous EEG collected during the visual stimulation allowing for high temporal resolution of signals from the primary and secondary visual cortices. Past research has linked these potential to gain control mechanisms in the brain, and analysis of the amplitude and latency effects of infusion w ill be considered  in this 
context.

14.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES   
This research will be carried out in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Guideline for 
Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance (E6), and applicable regulatory requirement(s) including clinical research guidelines established by the Basic Principle s 
defined in the U.S. 21 CFR  Parts 50, 56, and 312, and the Principl es enunciated in the 
Declaration of Helsinki (revised version Fortaleza 2013). 
 
14.2 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD, ETHICAL COMPLIANCE, 
INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILTIES , AND SPONSOR 
RESPONSIBILITIES  
 This study is being conducted to evaluate the safe-dose ranges and PK  of 
(2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine after slow -IV administration to healthy Subjects. The 
results of this study will provide useful information on dose and exposure of (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine by this mode of administration.   The primary ethical concerns of this study are that this study will be performed in healthy Subjects who will receive no benefit from participation in the study, except for financial compensation for the time and inconveniences that may arise from participation in the study.  As with all clinical studies, there are risks associated with the clinical procedures. To avoid unnecessary risks, met hods including the dosing strategy and blood sample 
collection scheme were designed to minimize the number of venipunctures required to complete the study. Further, the total volume of blood draws in support of clinical laboratory testing and PK evaluations collected from each Subject during the study does 
not exceed acceptable amount of blood to be collected over the defined time periods as recommended by standards set by the American Red Cross.  
 
Potential Subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, 
during the study, Subjects  will be given any new information that may affect their decision 
to continue participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is 
voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only Subjects  who are fully able 
to understand the risks, benefits, and potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent 
voluntarily will be enrolled.  
 Any woman who is pregnant, breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study will be excluded from participating in the study. Potential female Subjects must be postmenopausal, sterile, abstinent, or, if heterosexually active, be practicing a highly effective method of birth control before entry and throughout the study. Women, who are not heterosexually active at Screening, must agree to utilize a highly effective method of birth control if they become heterosexually active  during their participation in the study.

At least once a year, the IEC/IRB will be asked to review and reapprove this clinical study. The reapproval should be documented in writing (excluding the ones that are purely administrative, with no consequences for Subjects , data,  or study conduct). 
 At the end of the study, the Investigator (or sponsor where required) will notify the IEC/IRB about the study completion.  14.3 PRIVACY OF PERSONAL DATA  
The collection and processing of personal data from Subjects enrolled in this study will 
be limited to those data that are necessary to fulfill the objectives of the study.  These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or alteration must be put in place. Sponsor personnel whose responsibi lities require access to personal data agree to keep the identity of study 
Subjects confidential.  
 The informed consent obtained from the Subject includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data and for the Investigator to allow direct access to his or her 
original medical records for study -related monitoring, audit, IEC/IRB review, and 
regulatory inspection. This consent also addresses the transfer of the data to other entities and to other countries.  
The Subject has the right to request through the Investigator access to his or her personal

14.4 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
Neither the PI  nor the Sponsor will modify this protocol without a formal amendment. 
All protocol amendments must be issued by the PI  or the Sponsor and signed and dated 
by the PI . Protocol amendments must not be implemented without prior IEC/IRB 
approval, or when the relevant competent authority has raised any grounds for nonacceptance, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the Subjects , in 
which case the amendment must be promptly submitted to the IEC/IRB and relevant competent authority. Documentation of amendment approval by the Investigator and IEC/IRB must be provided to the sponsor or its designee. When the chang e(s) involve(s) 
only logistic or administrative aspects of the study, the IRB (and IEC where required) only needs to be notified.  During the study, in situations where a departure from the protocol is unavoidable, the PI 
or
 other physician in attendance w ill contact the appropriate sponsor representative. 
Except in emergency situations, this contact should be made before implementing any 
departure from the protocol. In all cases, contact with the Sponsor must be made as soon as possible to discuss the situ ation and agree on an appropriate course of action. The data 
recorded in the CRF and source documents will reflect any departure from the protocol, and the source documents will describe this departure and the circumstances requiring it.  
 14.5 
STUDY MONITORING  
The Sponsor will be allowed to perform on- site monitoring visits without restriction. The 
monitor will record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the site. The Sponsor monitoring activities during visits will cons ist of reviews of procedures and 
data integrity. Direct access to source documentation (medical records) is allowed for the purpose of verifying that the data recorded in the Sponsors database are consistent with the original source data. Findings from com parative reviews will be discussed with the 
PI. The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant investigational staff 
will be available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. The monitor will meet with the Investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct.  Representatives of the Sponsor’s clinical quality assurance department may visit the site at any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and company policy. These audits will require 
access to all study records, including source documents, for inspection and comparison with the Spons ors database. Subject privacy must, however, be respected. The PI  and 
staff are responsible for being present and available for consultation during routinely scheduled site audit visits conducted by the sponsor or its designees.  Similar auditing procedure s may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, 
either as part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a regulatory submission. The PI  should immediately notify the sponsor if 
they have been contacted by a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection.

14.6 STUDY COMPLETION OR TERMINATION 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason at the 
sole discretion of the Sponsor. The PI  may terminate the study at any time , provided there 
is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
 Reasons for the early  closure of an investigational site by the sponsor or Investigator may 
include, but are not limited to:  
 
• Failure of the PI  to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/IRB 
or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines. 
• Inadequate recruitment of Subjects by the PI . 
• Discontinuation of further drug development. 
 
The study i s considered completed with the last visit for the last Subject participating in 
the study. The final data from the investigational site will be sent to the Sponsor after 
completion of the final Subject visit at that site, in the time frame specified in th e Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  
 14.7 REGULATORY DOCUMENTATION 
This protocol and any amendment(s) must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities. A study may not be initiated until all regulatory requirements are met.

LOG  
The PI  agrees to complete a Subject identification and enrollment log to permit easy 
identification of each Subject during and after the study. This document will be reviewed by the sponsor site contact for completeness.  
 The Subject identification and enrollment log will be treated as confidential and will be filed by the Investigator in the study file. T o ensure Subject confidentiality, no copy will 
be made. All reports and communications relating to the study will identify Subjects by assigned number.  The PI  must also complete a Subject screening log, which reports on all Subjects who 
were seen to determine eligibility for inclusion in the study.  
 14.9 DATA CAPTURE, DATA QUALITY CONTROL, AND REPORTING  
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include review of protocol procedures with the PI and associated personnel before the study, periodic monitoring 
visits by the Sponsor, and direct transmission of clinical laboratory data, ECG data , and 
EEG data from central laboratories into the Sponsor’s database. Written instructions will be provided for electronic transfer of data to the Sponsor’s database. The Sponsor will

(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)   
Lifetime  Past Years  
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual 
suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun 
is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, 
a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you  a s a way to end your  life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you   ? 
Were you trying to end your life  when you  ? 
Or Did you think it was possible you could have  died  from   ? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel 
better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen )? (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt 
would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting. Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted 
attempt.  Shooting:  Person  has gun pointed toward  self, gun is taken  away  by someone else,  or is somehow prevented  from  pulling  trigger. Once 
they  pull the trigger, even if  the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt.  Jumping:  Person is  poised to  jump,  is grabbed  and taken  down from  ledge.  
Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0  
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medical damage, 
had potential for very serious lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage;  
laying on train tracks with oncoming train but pulled away before run over).

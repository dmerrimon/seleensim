CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 1.0 SYNOPSIS 
 
Overview  and Role of GVHD Prevention after HCT: 
This is a prospective phase II trial inv estigating the addition  of CD24Fc to standard acute 
graft-versus -host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (H CT). Despite the rapid expansion and curative potential of H CT for 
treating  hematologic malignancies, r ecipients remain at significant risk for  developing  
acute GVHD and its morbid sequel a.[1, 2] The combination of calcineurin inhibitor 
(tacrolimus  or cyclosporine A) with methotrexate (MTX) is the most common GVHD 
prophylaxis used worldwide in the context of myeloablative conditioning transplants. This 
regimen, implemented more than 3 decades ago, demonstrated improved control of acute 
GVHD[ 3, 4]. Acute grade II I-IV GVHD  is the principle contributor to early transplant related 
mortality (TRM), and develops in approximately  15-25% of recipients receiving  unrelated 
donor HCT despite standar d immunosuppressive prophylaxis. [5-8] At same time, 
leukemia relapse of primary malignancy  remains a major risk for mortality after HCT [9-
14]. However, the majority of  drugs currently  available or being developed for the 
prophylaxis and treatment of acute GVHD are based on general immunosuppression, 
which  can increase the risk for opportunistic  infection , contribute to significant morbidity , 
and increase leukemia relapse by reducing  the graft-versus -leukemia ( GVL) response 
[15].  Thus, novel GVHD prophylaxis strategies which successfully attenuate acute GVHD 
and limit leukemia relapse  are urgently  needed to improve outcomes after HCT . 
 Development of Novel Investigational Therapy (CD24Fc) for GVHD Prevention   
A CD24 fusion protein (CD24Fc) has been developed by OncoImmune Inc. to selectively target damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) -induced inflammation inherent to 
HCT. The protein was studied for its potential role in the prevention of acute GVHD.  
Following promising results in pre- clinical murine models of GVHD and demonstration of 
safety in heathy human subjects, a multi -site Phase IIa trial was initiated in 2016 to 
determine the safety and tolerability, the recommended P hase II  dose (RP2D) or 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the HCT setting .  The Phase IIa study consisted of two 
single ascending dose cohorts (240 mg and 480 mg) and one multi -dose cohort. In the 
two single dose cohorts, patients received a single administration of CD24Fc at 240 mg 
or 480 mg at day -1, one day before HCT.  In the multi -dosing cohort, patients received 3 
biweekly administrations of CD24Fc at 480 mg (day -1), 240 mg (day +14) and 240 mg  
(day +28). Each cohort enrolled 8 patients, randomized 3:1 ( drug:placebo) for a total 
enrollment of 24 patients, with 18 receiving study drug.   
 The enrollment of three cohorts of Phase IIa was completed in December 2017 with primary follow up through day 100 post HCT, data- lock and unblinding completed in May 
2018. All patients continue to be followed for one year.    
 Results of Phase IIa Clinical Trial of CD24Fc after HCT:  
The study has shown that the si ngle dose of IV administration of CD24Fc  up to 480 mg 
and multi -dosing of 480  mg, 240 mg, and 240  mg are well tolerated in the intent -to-treat

 (ITT) population.  An MTD was not established.   The median follow -up is 10 months ( from 
6 months to 18 months ).  Median age for the 18 patients that received study drug is  63 
years, with t wo thirds of the patients over 60  years of age.  All patients are undergoing 
myeloablative allogeneic matched unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation. No 
infusion toxicities, dose limiting toxicities  (DLTs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) 
attributable or  likely attributable to the study drug  were observed. All patients achieved 
primary  neutrophil and platelet engraftment . 
 
The incidence of 180 day Grade II -IV acute GVHD  was 39%. The incidence of severe 
Grade III -IV GVHD in the CD24Fc treated cohort was  6% at day 180 with only one subject 
developing grade III GVHD with lower GI  tract involvement. Among  patients  who 
developed GVHD there were no instances of steroid resistance. The 180 day Grade III -
IV GVHD -free survival is 94% in the CD24Fc -treated group and 50% in the placebo group. 
One year non-relapse mortality (NRM) is 6% in the CD24Fc treated group and 17% in the 
placebo group.  An unanticipated observation in this Phase IIa study was a lower than 
anticipated rates of leukemia relapse, with 2 of 18 patien ts (11%)  experiencing recurrence 
of the primary malignancy compared to 2 of 6 patients (33%) in the placebo group over 
16 months (range of 11 - 24 months) of follow up. The respective one-year overall survival 
(OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) estimates are both at 83% in the CD24Fc group and 
50% in the placebo group. These data provide encouraging early evidence that CD24Fc 
is safe and may improve the HCT outcomes.  
 
Based on the Phase IIa safety results, pharmacokinetic data, promising rates of severe 
aGVHD and  evaluating  feedback from the FDA, the study protocol has been amended 
prior to proceeding to a large randomized trial.  The amendment proposes  to first perform 
an open label  single arm expansion cohort to further establish safety at the recommended 
Phase II dose (RP2D) and gain additional data regarding the potential efficacy of this 
dose in improving grade III -IV acute GVHD free survival at 180 day post HCT.   This 
information that will be used in the development of a subsequent randomized Phase I II to 
assess efficacy of CD24Fc in  improving aGVHD -free survival.  
 Primary O bjective(s): 
 Phase IIa: The primary objective of Phase IIa is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
CD24Fc in subjects undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT) , and  to define the recommended Phase II b dose (RP2D)  or 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  for the addition of CD24Fc to standard GVHD 
prophylaxis.  
 Phase IIa – Expansion Cohort:  
The primary objective of the expansion cohort is to determine if combining CD24Fc with 
standard GVHD prophylaxis improves day 180 grade III -IV acute GVHD free survival 
(AGFS) when compared to matched registered controls with standard GVHD prophylaxis.

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 Patient E ligibility:  
Eligible patients will be those requiring allogeneic HCT for malignant hematologic 
conditions  and receiving a myeloablative conditioning regimen. An unrelated donor is 
required to match at HLA-A, -B, -C, and –DRB1 loci.  Eligibility crit eria are defined in 
Section 4.0.  
 Study Design:  
This is a multicenter prospective randomized P hase IIa with a 20 patient expansion cohort  
clinical trial design ed to determine  the RP2D or MTD of CD24Fc  for acute GVHD  
prophylaxis.  Phase IIa is a randomized double blind trial comprised of : i) 2 single 
ascending dose cohorts of 8 patients  (3:1 treatment:placebo) ; and ii)  a multi -dosing cohort 
consisting of 8 patients (3:1 treatment:placebo)  that will receive 3 consecutive biweekly 
administrations of CD24Fc. The multi -dose cohort will be initiated prior to enrolling the 
highest single dose (960 mg) cohort and the total dose administered will be equal to the 
highest single dose. The total planned enrollment for the Phase IIa portion is 24 subjects . 
If CD24 Fc de monstrates safety  and tolerability  in Phase IIa, the trial will proceed to a 20 
patient expansion cohort. All other components of the allogeneic H CT process will be  
according to routine institutional practice. This trial will exclusively utilize  unrelated donors 
that receive myeloablative conditioning  regimen s and  attempt to improve  upon standard  
GVHD prophylaxis  with tacrolimus  and methotrexate.  In the single dose cohorts, the study 
agent, CD24Fc , will be administered  as a single dose on day -1 pre-transplant . In the 
multi dose cohort  the patient s CD24Fc  will be administered  on days -1, 14  and 28.  
 The amendment to conduct Phase II expansion will utilize unrelated donors that receive 
pre-defined myeloablative conditioning regimens and attempt to improve upon standard 
GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus and methotrexate. In the Phase II expansion cohort, the study agent, CD24Fc, will be administered on days -1, 14, and 28 at the dose of 
480mg, 240 mg and 240mg, respectively, as established in Phase IIa.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNI FICANCE  
 
3.1 IMPORTANCE OF IMPROV ING GVHD PREVENTION  
 
Allogeneic HCT is an expanding therapeutic modality for a growing number of malignant  
and non- malignant conditions . Each year  allogeneic  HCT is performed in greater than 
21,000 patients worldwide as a potentially curative option for hematologic diseases. [16] 
However, its success  is limited by  transplantation related mortality  (TRM ), particularly 
when utilizing  unrelated o r non -HLA matched donors. Acute GVHD is the  most frequent 
life thr eatening complication after  HCT and often contributes to mortality related to 
infection. [6, 17] Because GVHD  is the principle contributor to TRM, it poses  a 
fundamental  barrier to improving outcomes after HCT .[18, 19]  
 For over 20 years, the combination of a calcineurin inhibitor  (e.g. cyclosporine and 
tacrolimus ) with methotrexate has remained the standard of care for the prevention of 
GVHD.[ 6] Despite routine administration of immune prophylaxis , clinically significant  
GVHD (Grade II -IV) occurs in  approximately  50 to 80% of patients receiving  unrelated  
donor H CT.[2, 5, 20-22]  
 Several recent single center or large CIBMTR data analyses suggest that moderate, 
Grade II  severity,  which comprises the majority of  acute GVHD events , may have less 
demonstrable effects on overall survival [23, 24].  Nonetheless , in patients with very 
severe Grade III- IV GVHD (Figure 1 ), mortality  rates are 50- 90%.[18, 25, 26]
 One 
explanation  for this  is that, once grade III -IV GVHD  is established, ineffective responses  
occur to front-line therapy with high dose corticosteroids  in greater than 50% of 
patients .[27] S urvival  is significantly diminished  for patients who demonstrate steroid 
refractoriness  or who require prolonged treatment .[26, 28, 29] Even when successful, 
high doses of corticosteroids are a major source of morbidity due to increased infections 
and deconditioning  that places  patient s at significant risk for TRM. [30, 31] These factors  
highlight  the impor tance of improving  our current approaches for the prevent ion of  grade 
III-IV acute GVHD .[25-27]

3.2 PATHOGENESIS OF GVHD  
 
Acute GVHD result s from immunologically -mediated injury to host tiss ues.[32] 
Experimental data have shown that GVHD stems from allogeneic donor lymphocytes 
responding to host tissues that express  
polym orphic human leukocyte 
antigens, [5] that culminate in clinical  
manifestations , namely inflammatory 
responses that  primarily involve the skin,  
intestine , and liver . These events are 
driven  by interactions between antigen 
present ing cells (APCs), specifically  
dendritic cells  that activate donor T 
cells.[33-35] The subsequent 
immunologic cascade results in the release of pro- inflamma tory cytokines 
and expansion of antigen specific  allo-
reactive T cells that target host tissues . A 
key inciting event is believed to be direct 
tissue damage from pre HCT 
conditioning regimens,[ 36, 37] which are 
routinely empl oyed f or immune- ablation 
of host immunity and control of primary 
malignancy. Unfortunately, c onditioning

 therapy also causes broad tissue injurious effects that result  in the releas e of pro-
inflammatory cytokines , and damage -associated molecular patterns  (DAMPs) capable of 
initiating and propagating the inflammatory cascade of GVHD  (Figure  2).  
 
3.3 CURRENT THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES FOR G VHD 
 
To date, treatment  and prevention  of GVHD has  predominantly  focused on either  
pharmacologic inhibition[ 6, 8] or depletion of T cells through in vitro[38] or in vivo  
approaches  to limit expansion of alloreactive T cells that mediate tissue injury .[39] While  
non-selective T -cell depleting strategies (e.g. anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) ) are 
efficacious in prevent ing GVHD, they do not improve survival due to offsetting risks for 
relapse, infection and graft rejection. [31, 40, 41] A recent prospective, randomized, 
double- blind,  placebo controlled,  Phase III clinical trial comparing adding ATG to standard 
GVHD prophylaxis showed that  although ATG reduced the incidence of Grade II -IV acute 
GVHD and chronic GVHD, ATG may have an overall  negative impact on neutrophil and 
platelet engraftment, increased rates of  CMV reactivation, as well as significantly reduced  
overall survival and relapse free survival [15].  Other large registry analysis have not 
clearly demonstrated a clinical survival benefit  for T cell depleting strategies [63].  
Conversely , more selective inhibition by targeting  single pro- inflammatory cytokines  to 
prevent GVHD  has not demonstrated clinical benefit on overall survival and relapse free 
survival  .[42, 43 ] [44, 45] 
 
3.4 ROLE OF SIGLEC -G IN APC MEDI ATED  RESPONSE TO TISSUE I NJURY  
 
We and others have demonstrated a critic al role of 
host APCs in the induction of experimental GVHD .[33-
35, 46, 47]  Through  highly conserved  toll-like 
receptors (TLRs)  and other pattern recognition 
receptors  (PRRs),  APCs acutely sense endogenous  
“danger ” signals  from DAMPs such as HMGB1 and 
heat-shock proteins released during tissue 
damage.[ 48] Mounting experimental evidence now 
recognizes innate immune activation  via DAMPs  as a 
key initiating , step in promoting  allogeneic T cell 
responses  that drive  GVHD.[ 49-51] These findings 
suggest  that targeting APC responses t o DAMPs 
might be exploited as a novel approach to GVHD  
prevention and therapy . To limit  their activating  
responses  to DAMPs , murine APCs  express  Sialic-
acid–binding immunoglobulin- like lectin -G (Siglec -G; 
its homolog in humans is Siglec -10) proteins  that serve 
as negative regulators of DAMP  driven immune activation.[ 52] Recent preclinical data

 effects  against GVHD  in multiple models of allogeneic H CT. [53] Followi ng HLA matched 
and mismatched H CT, Siglec -G-/- deficient animals have  heightened release of multiple 
pro-inflammatory cytokines,  stimulate  greater numbers of alloreactive T cells  and 
ultimately  experience inferior survival due to increased GVHD  severity  compared to 
allogeneic controls  (Figure  3). These findings identify Siglec -G, particularly on 
hematopoietic APCs, as highly relevant for regulating  inflammatory responses , and 
subsequent adaptive T cell responses that produce GVHD.   
 
3.5 CD24 -SIGLEC I NTERACTIONS  IN THE HOST RESPONSE TO TI SSUE I NJURY  
 
Host tissue injury  caused by myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) 
conditioning regimens, including high- dose chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation 
(TBI), not only promote release of DAMPs [54-56] but also have been shown 
experimentally  in mice  to reduce Siglec -G expression.[ 53] Thus, conditioning therapy may 
itself limit  the capacity of Siglec -G to attenuate inflammatory responses triggered by  
DAMPs .  
  Recent data has identified a critical interaction between Siglec -G (and Siglec -10) and 
CD24 (also known as cluster of differentiation 24 or heat stable antigen (HSA)) , which  is 
a small glycosyl- phosphatidyl -inositol (GPI) -anchored glycoprotein expressed on the 
membrane surface of hematopoietic cells , including lymphocytes, dendritic cells and  
macrophages .[57] W hen expressed on T cells , CD24  is essential  for down- modulating 
immune stimulation by DAMPs. [58, 59] It has been shown that CD24 directly associates 
with DAMPs thereby ameliorating their stimulatory activity  (Figure 4). The interaction of 
CD24  with Siglecs  (murine Siglec -G or human Siglec 10) also results in inhibition of  
nuclear factor kappaB (NF -kappaB), facilitatin g an attenuated damage response.[ 59] It is 
postulated that the CD24 -Siglec G /10 pathway  affords the host protection against  
exaggerated response s to pathological cell death, and most  importantly discriminates  HMGB1/HSP70/90

 between tissue damage (i.e. DAMP) versus pathog en (i.e. PAMP)  immune activation. 
Since HCT is associated with tissue injury from conditioning and GVHD,  and places 
immune deficient hosts at risk for infectious complications,  the CD24 - Siglec G /10 
pathway is a compelling therapeutic target  for more selectively  mitigating GVHD while 
leaving the pathogen -specific immune responses intact and thus addressing one of the 
limitations of T cell directed therapy . 
 
3.6 PRECLINICAL STUDIES OF CD24FC FOR PREVENT ION OF GVHD  
 
Consistent with  the loss of Siglec -G, in 
murine models of allogeneic HCT  we 
observed that lack of CD2 4 expression 
on T cells promotes  greater GVHD 
severit y. This provides evidence of a 
crucial interaction between Siglec -G 
and CD24 in modulating  immune 
response. CD24Fc (CD24 Ig) is a fusion 
protein consisting of the extracellular domain of mature human CD24 linked 
to the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc domain  (OncoImmune, Inc.) . Similar 
to native CD24, in vitro  studies 
demonstrate that CD24Fc binds to 
murine Siglec -G (and its human 
orthologue, Siglec 10).[ 58] CD24Fc also 
stimulates tyrosine- phosphorylation of, 
and SHP -1 association to Siglec G . In 
preclinical models of HCT, administration of exogenous CD24Fc restores  Siglec G signaling and reverses  the 
exaggerated GVHD observed with CD24
-/- T cells  (Figure 5).[53] Moreover, CD24Fc also 
ameliorates  GVHD from  wild type  allogeneic T cells  by enhancing CD24 – Siglec -G 
signaling . Taken together, these multiple lines of experimental evidence support  
suppression of innate immune responses, specifically by enhancing CD24-Siglec -G 
interactions that are capable of regulating  severe tissue damage mediated inflammatory 
disorders such as  GVHD. The availability of c linical grade CD24Fc provides a unique  
opportunity to target this pathway as an innovative strategy for GVHD prevention.   
 
3.7 RATIONALE FOR CLINIC AL STUDY OF CD24FC F OR GVHD PREVENTION  
 
Several lines of evidence provide compelling rationale to support clinical investigation of CD24Fc for GVHD prevention. First, preclinical evidence in several well -established HCT 
models suggest that CD24Fc is effective  in preventing GVHD. Second, the mechanism 
of immune modulation by CD24Fc is ideally suited to the inflammatory state immediately

 preceding  HCT, which results from exacerbated immunologic responses to DAMPs  that 
are released through generalized tissue damage by myeloablative conditioning, a 
necessary component of the HCT procedure for reducing leukemic relapse [64]. As 
opposed to standard GVHD therapies that directly  inhibit T cell responses, targeting 
Siglec -10 – CD24 interactions with CD24Fc provides a completely novel strategy for 
preventing GVHD by directly interrupting the immune response to chemotherapy -
associated inflammatory signaling or DAMPs, a major GVHD initiating event. Third, CD24Fc has demonstrated initial safety in healthy  human  subject s and a P hase IIa dose 
finding clinical trial in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT, coupled with a good tolerability, making it suitable for  additional  study in this vulnerable population. Fourth, 
GVHD occurs at a high incidence and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 
thus reflecting an unmet clinical need. Therefore, improving standard of care GVHD prevention strategies could expand the curative potential of HCT . Finally, e stablishing 
proof -of-concept  and efficacy in a prototypical immune disorder would provide key 
evidence for further definitive investigations of CD24Fc for the treatment and prevention 
of GVHD and other inflammatory conditions .    
 
3.8 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE OF CD24FC IN HUMANS  
 3.8.1.
 PHASE I SUMMARY : 
OncoI mmune  Inc. has  developed and manufactured  clinical grade  CD24Fc for use in 
humans . CD24Fc has been tested in a Phase I clinical trial in healthy human subjects, 
and this study showed preliminary safety of  single dose CD24Fc by  IV admin istration . A 
total of 40 subjects were randomized in 5 cohorts of 8 subjects,  and 39 subjects 
completed the study. CD24Fc was administered via IV infusion over 1 hour  at doses 
ranging from 10 to 240 mg, and the subjects were followed over a six -week period.  A 
MTD was not encountered.  
 
In general, adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.  The most common AEs 
were headache (6 [15.0%] subjects), burns second degree (3 [7.5%] subjects), non-
sustained ventricular tachycardia (2 [5.0%] subjects), and upper respiratory tract infection 
(2 [5.0%] subjects).  The rates of the AEs were  similar in the placebo control group. The 
SAE of ventricular tachycardia was considered mild in severity by the investigator and did 
not lead to discontinuation of the subjec t from the study. This SAE was considered to be 
drug related due to its close temporal proximity to dosing, though similar short, isolated episodes of non- sustained ventricular tachycardia may be seen in up to 4% o f normal, 
healthy populations. No deaths or adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred during the study.

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 A Phase IIa prospective randomized double- blind clinical trial of CD24Fc for acute GVHD 
prophylaxis in myeloablative matched unrelated donor HCT was initiated in July 2016. 
The first patient was enrolled in Sept 2016. A total of 24 patients were enrolled in three 
cohorts, 240mg single dose given at day -1, 480mg single dose at day  -1, 480-240-240mg 
multi- dose given on day -1, day 14 and day 28, with 6 patients receiving CD24Fc and 2 
patients receiving  placebo in each cohort. The last patient was enrolled in Dec 2017. The 
last patient reached 100 days post -HCT on Apr. 5, 2018. Data was locked  and unblinded 
on May 17, 2018.  In total t here are 18 patients in the CD24Fc group and 6 patients in the 
placebo group (3:1 randomization) .  All planned dosages were delivered on schedule.    
 
3.8.2.1.   PHASE 2A CLINICAL ST UDY  OVERVIEW  
The primary objectives of the Phase IIa are to assess  the safety  and tolerability of CD24Fc 
in combination with methotrexate and tacrolimus prophylaxis in subjects undergoing 
matched unrelated donor HCT following myeloablative conditioning , and to define the 
recommended P hase II  dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) . In addition, 
second ary efficacy objectives in the Phase IIa include:  
• assessing grade II – IV aGVHD free survival (GFS) at day 180 after HCT,  
• assessing the incidence of c hronic GVHD (cGVHD) at one year following HCT  
• assessing the incidence of relapse one year following HCT  
• assessing the incidence of transplant -related mortality (TRM) one year following 
HCT 
• assessing infection rates at day 100 following HCT  
• evaluating overall survival (OS), absence of grade III -IV GVHD, and relapse- free 
survival one year following HCT  
• evaluating conditioning toxicity including oral mucositis and organ failure 
Other  exploratory objectives include  assess ment of  the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 
CD24Fc, examining the immune cell profile and functional responses of APCs and T cells 
after HCT in the CD24Fc and placebo groups, and assessing pharmacodynamics (PD) biomarkers such as the plasma concentrations of pro- inflammatory cytokines, DAMPs, 
lipids, a nd GVHD biomarkers in the CD 24Fc and placebo groups.  
 
Subjects between the ages of 18- 70 years old undergoing matched unrelated donor 
allogeneic HCT for a malignant hematologic condition with a Karnofsky performance 
score ≥ 70% were eligible for the trial.  An 8/8 HLA allelic match between the unrelated 
donor and the recipient at HLA -A, HLA -B, HLA -C, and HLA -DRB1 was required. 
Restricting the study to patients receiving HCT from unrelated donors was expected to 
limit heterogeneity and facilitate statistical estimates of  toxicity and aGVHD incidence for 
subsequent efficacy assessments, given the historically greater inc idence of grade II – IV 
aGVHD (5 0 – 80%) and grade III -IV aGVHD (20 -35%) in this population.

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 All subjects received myeloablative conditioning  and standard of care GVHD prophylaxis 
with methotrexate and tacrolimus per the P hase IIa protocol. Patients received a 
myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of either fludarabine and busulfan (Flu/Bu) 
or cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (Cy/TBI), as decided by the treating 
physician, followed by an infusion of stem cells on day 0.  The source of donor stem cells 
was either peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow (BM).  GVHD prophylaxis 
was administered to all subjects and consisted of tacrolimus (initiated Day -3 before 
transplant) and methotrexate (initiated Day +1 after transplant) in combination with CD24Fc in the treatment arms, and tacrolimus /methotrexate plus saline solution  in the 
placebo arm. In the absence of GVHD, tacrolimus tapering started on day +100.  
The trial included two ascending single- dose cohorts (240 mg and 480 mg) and a multi -
dose cohort (480- 240-240 mg in three biweekly doses). In the single dose cohorts 
CD24Fc was administered as a single dose on day -1 pre- transplant. In the multi dose 
cohort CD24Fc was administered on days -1, 14 and 28. Eight patients (randomized 3:1 
treatment to placebo) were enrolled in each of the 3 cohorts. All patients who signed consent, met el igibility and were enrolled proceed to randomization and study treatment.  
 
3.8.2.2.   STUDY RESULTS  
 
3.8.2.2.1.  DEMOGRAPHY OF STUDY POPULATION  
Subjects were enrolled in the Phase IIa from Sept 2016 to Dec 2017.  A total of 18 subjects 
received CD24Fc in combination with methotrexate and tacrolimus, and 6 subjects in the 
placebo group received methotrexate and tacrolimus  with saline . As of the cutoff date for 
the data described in this application (May 17, 2018) the median follow -up of P hase IIa 
subjects was 10 months. The survival data was updated on November 28, 2018, the date of our latest safety monitoring meeting  with all surviving subjects surpassing the 6- month 
follow -up period.  
Table 1 lists demography information and clinical characteristics for subjects in the 
CD24Fc and placebo groups , which were relatively balanced across risk factors such as 
age, malignancy, and comorbidity. The most common malignanc ies in both the CD24Fc 
and placebo groups  was AML  and MDS (66.7% and 83.3%, respectively ). At least half of 
the subjects in both groups  had a comorbidity index of intermediate or high. PBSCs were 
more frequently used as the graft source as compared to bone marrow in both groups , 
and Flu/Bu 4 was the most common conditioning regimen across both cohorts. There were  four patients in the CD24Fc group that used Cy/TBI  conditioning.   Patients in the 
CD24Fc group were also relatively older in age (62 vs. 57 years).   
A contemporary control group of 92 adult patients comprising  69% AML/MDS, 26% ALL, 
3% CML and 2% CMML was obtained from  the University of Michigan and The Ohio State 
University  for comparative analysis given the small size of the placebo group.

engraftment before expir ing on Day 49 , the platelets engrafted a median of 13.0 and 15.0 
days after HCT in CD24Fc exposed and placebo subjects, respectively. There were no 
cases of graft failure. The median CD3 chimerism at day +30 was 82.5% (range 38- 100%) 
in the CD24Fc exposed patients and 82.0% (range, 62% -91%) in the placebo group. The 
median donor CD3 chimerism increased to 86% (range, 42% -100%) at day 100 in the 
CD24Fc exposed subjects and 84% (range, 17% -100%) in the placebo group. Donor 
CD33 chimerism at day 30 and 100 was 100% in both the CD24Fc and placebo groups.

 the Phase IIa. Four cases of grade II GVHD involved skin only and two cases involved 
skin and the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There were no cases grade II GVHD in the placebo group.  
When evaluating subjects with the more serious aGVHD grade III – IV, only 5.6% (1/18) 
of subjects in the CD24Fc cohorts experienced grade III GVHD (1 subject in the 480 mg 
cohort with lower GI involvement) as compared to 16.7% of subjects in the placebo group (1/6, also with lower GI involvement) and 24% in the contemporary control cohort. All patients who developed aGVHD in the trial at the time of the data cutoff have responded to steroid treatment . 
After the first one hundred days post HCT, subjects are evaluated quarterly for late onset 
aGVH D or cGVHD until one year after HCT. No additional aGVHD events have been 
observed in the CD24Fc cohorts through minimum of 180 days of post-transplant  follow -
up.  
 
3.8.2.2. 3.  RELAPSE, TRM  AND MORTALITY
 
The incidence of leukemia relapse in subjects exposed to CD24Fc at Day 180 post HCT 
is lower as compared to subjects in the placebo group,  with 11% (2/18) versus 33% (2/6), 
respectively, (see Table 3 ). Considering the limited sample size of available placebo 
controls in the P hase IIa portion, a post -hoc analysis of patients was conducted at the 
highest enrolling centers involved in this trial (UM, OSU) the relapse incidence in 92 similarly treated patients receiving myeloablative unrelated donor HCT using tacrolimus and methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis was 23% at day 180.  
Regarding details of the relapse events in the current  Phase IIa  study o ne subject in the 
480 mg CD24Fc cohort experienced relapse of high risk CMML on Day 146 and one 
subject in the multi -dose 480/240/240 mg CD24Fc cohort experienced relaps e of ALL on 
Day 100 post HCT. The patient with CMML passed away on Day 196 due to leukemia. The patient with ALL relapse was treated with blinatumomab and achieved complete 
remission. The patient with ALL relapse was treated with blinatumomab and achieved 
complete remission. The patient experienced ALL relapse again 6 months later, 
underwent a haploidentical HCT and passed away on Day 357 post first allo- HCT. In the 
placebo cohort, two subjects experienced relapse of CMML on Day 94 and MDS on Day 146. The p atient with CMML passed away on Day 316 and the patient with MDS passed 
away on Day 184. These preliminary results suggest CD24Fc may suppress GVHD 
without  interfer ing with the beneficial graft -versus -leukemia (GVL) process,  which if 
confirmed  in prospecti ve datasets, would represent a significant advance over available 
immune suppressive therapy. Relapse has been monitored as of the writing of this report with a median of 16 months of follow up, with no changes in the incidence of relapse in 
any of the coh orts, up to the Safety Meeting on Nov. 28, 2018.  
The incidence of transplantation related mortality (TRM)  in the CD24Fc group is also 
lower than in the placebo group. At Day 180 post HCT, no death occurred in the CD24Fc 
group, and one death due to pneumonia  occurred in the placebo cohort (16.7%). Over

3.8.2.2. 5.  REDUCTION OF CONDITIONING R ELATED MUCOSITIS  
Myeloablative conditioning for HCT is often associated with severe regimen related 
toxicity including organ failure. G rade 3- 4 mucositis  occurs in approximately 90% of 
patients receiving radiation containing regimens [65], which can promote mucosal 
barrier injury and infection, utilization of opioid analgesia and parenteral nutrition, and 
prolongation of hospitalization.  In the CD24Fc g roup of 18 patients, none died within the 
first 100 days post HCT, while 1 out of 6 in the placebo group died on Day 48 due to 
pulmonary toxicity with respiratory failure. Severe oral mucositis has been reported by 
HCT patients as the most distressing symptom they experienced [63]. We calculated 
the grade- day score of severe grade 3- 4 mucositis  (total number of days patients had 
grade 3- 4 mucositis)  in the placebo cohort and three CD24Fc treatment  cohorts. 
CD24Fc  multi -dosing had a significant reduction of severe mucositis grade- day score 
(placebo vs. 960 multi -dose: P=0.03) (Figure 7).  
 
Figure 7. Mucositis scores calculated as multiple of severe mucositis grade >3 and 
duration (person- days).  
 
3.8.2.2. 7.  INFECTION  
 
There are 10 patients in the CD24Fc group that were at  risk of CMV reactivation 
(Donor/Recipient CMV status before HCT: D+/R+, 5; D -/R+, 3; unknown D/R+, 1; D+/R -, 
1).  Eight patients have status of D -/R- which are not considered to be at risk. Two D -/R+ 
patients had CMV reactivation at Day 42 and Day 48, representing 20% cumulative 
incidence of CMV reactivation at Day 100 in the high risk  CD24Fc group. Both patients

 had prior steroid treatment before the CMV reactivation.  In comparison, 2 patients in the 
placebo group are at risk of CMV reactivation (D+/R+, 1 ; D-/R+, 1; D -/R-, 4). One patient 
had CMV reactivation at Day 47 ( 50%) even through the patient was without prior steroid 
treatment . There were no instances of CMV end organ disease. No patients in either arm 
received CMV directed antiviral prophylaxis.  
Other infections are also comparable between CD24Fc and placebo groups, including 
bacterial infection (50% vs . 33%) and fungal infection (11% vs. 0%).  
Overall t here is no noticeable increase of infections in the CD24Fc treated group.  
 
3.8.2.2. 8.  SAFETY  
Overall, CD24Fc was well tolerated in the Phase IIa study . There were no infusion- related 
toxicities. There was one possible drug related treatment emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) 
of ≥ grade III -IV hyperglycemia in the 480 mg CD24Fc group, which was managed with 
insulin. One dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in the placebo group, and no DLTs 
were observed in the CD24Fc group. There were no adverse events leading to death in 
subjects administered CD24Fc within the 180 days (at least 150 days after the last dosing 
of CD24Fc). There was one adverse event of pneumonia that led to the death of a subject at Day 48 in the placebo group. One patient in the CD24Fc group died at 7 months after 
HCT from pneumonia which was determined to be unlikely related to study drug. The 
development of anti -drug antibodies (ADA) were not detected in any of the 24 subjects at 
any point out to day 100 after HCT.  
The most common TEAEs ≥ grade III (> 10%) included a decrease in platelet counts 
(83.3% placebo and 94.4% CD24Fc), decrease in WBC counts (66.7% placebo and 
88.9% CD24Fc), decrease in neutrophil counts (50% placebo and 83.3% CD24Fc), decrease in lymphocyte counts (50% placebo and 77.8% CD24Fc), anemia (50% placebo and 66.7% CD24Fc), stomatitis (83.3% placebo and 50% CD24Fc), and nausea (0% placebo and 11.1% CD24Fc). These are expected SAEs were anticipated  as they were 
hematologic in nature and were otherwise considered related t o the myeloablative 
conditioning  regimen of HCT.  
3.8.3
 CONCLUSION  AND PLANS FOR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT  
 
The preliminary clinical evidence from the Phase IIa study suggests that CD24Fc is  safe 
and potentially beneficial when administered in combination with m ethotrexate and 
tacrolimus in patients who undergo HCT from an unmatched donor following 
myeloablative conditioning. As described above, the cumulative incidence of grade III – 
IV aGVHD is 6% in CD24Fc exposed subjects as compared to 17% in the placebo group 
(methotrexate and tacrolimus plus saline ) and 24% in the contemporary control cohort 
(methotrexate and tacrolimus alone). These data suggest that administration of CD24Fc in combination with methotrexate and tacrolimus as prophylaxis reduces the risk of  grade

 III – IV aGVHD in HCT patients, the most serious grades of aGVHD which are associated 
with increased risk of non- relapse mortality  [64].  A trend of reduction in the incidence of 
relapse is also observed in subject s who received CD24Fc (11.1%) as compared to 
subjects who did not, both as compared to the placebo group (33.3%) and two sets of 
internal and external (CIBMTR) contemporary controls ( both 23%), demonstrating that 
CD24Fc does not affect the GVT effects of the graft and may contain salutary properties 
that prevent leukemia relapse. The benefit of including CD24Fc in standard GVHD 
prophylaxis regimens is further supported by the better NRM in CD24Fc exposed subjects 
(6%) as compared to placebo (17%), better 1- year overall survival (83% versus 50%, 
CD24Fc versus placebo), a statistically significant improvement in grade III – IV aGVHD 
GFS ( 94% versus 50%, CD24Fc versus placebo, respectively), a dose- dependent 
reduction in severe mucositis, and a favorable overall  safety profile with only one drug -
related TEAE (grade III) observed in the study.  
Based on these favorable findings and discussions with FDA,  sponsor and 
coordinating instituti ons, it was deemed beneficial  to enroll  an expansion cohort 
of patients to be treated with the CD24FC multidose regimen in accordance with 
this amended protocol.  Estimates of acute GVHD free survival obtained from dose 
expansion phase will enable further  assessment the promising results observed in 
Phase IIa by increasing available data in patients treated at the RP2D, and 
optimizing development of  sufficiently powered Phase III randomized controlled 
study.   Protocol -defined criteria for patient selection, treatment, data collection, 
follow -up visit schedule, and safety monitoring will remain substantially 
unchanged. However, the efficacy endpoints and statistical analysis methods will be updated to describe a more rigorous assessment of clinical outcomes using case- matched historical controls  with pre -specified clinical criteria from a large 
international registry database  (CIBMTR).

approved informed consent must be obtained from patients (or legal guardians) prior to  
the initiation of treatment on this protocol. Patient demographics, including underlying 
disease, donor type, and eligibility criteria will be recorded at entry into the study. All 
screening evaluations will be completed as part of the local institutions  standard work up 
for HCT.  
 Patient Characteristics to be Collected at Registration for Cohort Matching .  
The patient’s age, gender, the CIBMTR CRID number, underlying disease, disease risk 
index  (DRI)  [66], disease remission status, conditioning regimen, cell source, 
donor/recipient CMV status, HCT -CI, KPS, transplant center and donor age/gender  will 
be recorded and reported to University of Michigan O-CTSU as part of patient enrollment. 
These pre -specified parameters will be utilized to assemble an external database of 
registered case matched controls  from the CIBMTR.   
 
5.2 OVERVIEW   
 
This is a prospective Phase II clinical trial designed to assess the safety , tolerability, and 
preliminary efficacy of the addition of  CD24Fc to  standard tacrolimus and methotrexate 
GVHD prophylaxis.  This trial employs a sequential design. The initial P hase IIa portion is 
a randomized double blind study to establish the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D)  or 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  of CD24Fc and is comprised of: i) t wo single 
ascending dose cohorts (240 mg  and 480 mg CD24Fc administered on day -1) of 8 
patients (3:1 treatment:placebo) ; and ii) a multi -dosing cohort consisting of 8 patients (3:1 
treatment:placebo)  that will receive 3 consecutive biweekly administrations of CD24Fc on 
day -1 (480 mg), day 14 (240 mg) and day 28 (240 mg) . The total planned enrollment for 
the Phase IIa portion is 24 subjects.      
 This is a prospective Phase II clinical trial designed to assess the safety , tolerability, and 
preliminary efficacy of the addition of  CD24Fc to  standard t acrolimus and methotrexate

 RP2D with standard immune prophylaxis to determine if this combination reduces the 
incidence of acute GVHD after HCT  compared to  standard prophylaxis  alone. The aim of 
this portion of the trial is to investigate the ability of this new regimen for GVHD prevention 
to improve AGFS. Since the potential efficacy of CD24Fc in GVHD prevention is not established, this will enable assessment of init ial efficacy in improving AGFS, which will 
be determined in a subsequent randomized placebo controlled trial.  
  All patients will undergo HLA matched unrelated donor allogeneic HCT according to  
standard institutional practice.  This trial will exclusively f ocus  on HLA matched unrelated 
donors given the historically greater incidence of grade II -IV acute GVHD in this 
population . Restricting the study to unrelated donors  receiving myeloablative conditioning  
will limit heterogeneity  in Phase IIa to best assess potential toxicity and facilitate statistical 
estimates of GVHD  and relapse  incidence for subsequent efficacy assessments. The 
preparative regimen will employ standard doses of myeloablative conditioning , with 
suggested regimens outlined  in section 5.6.   
 
5.3 TREATMENT SCHEMA  
 
For the single dose escalation cohorts  of the study, t he investigational agent ( CD24Fc ) 
will be give n intravenously as a single dose on day -1 before HCT (Figure 8A). In the 
Phase IIa portion of the study a dose level will be assigned at enrollment.  
 For the multi -dosing cohort, the investigational agent ( CD24Fc ) will be given intravenously  
on day -1 (480 mg) before HCT, and on day 14 (240 mg) and day 28 (240 mg) post HCT  
(Figure 8B).  
 Based on the Phase IIa clinical safety results and the pharmacokinetic data, the recommended Phase III dose was determined to be multi -dose 480- 240-240 mg 
administered on day -1, day 14 and day 28.  The Phase II expansion cohort will use the 
same multi -dose 480- 240-240 mg regimen. This regimen will provide biologically active 
levels of CD24Fc through the peak period of DAMP exposure and acute GVHD (median 30 days). The Phase II expansion study schema is shown in Figure 8C.   
 
Dosing is based on a fixed amount and not based on weight or BSA .

5.4 RATIONALE FOR TR EATMENT SCHEMA  
 
We propose early administration of CD24Fc for acute GVHD prevention based on the following rationale: 1) during or immediately following HCT myeloablative conditioning tissue injury ensues resulting in release of inflammatory mediators, including exaggerat ed 
levels of DAMPs, that have been implicated in the initiation of acute GVHD; 2) through direct blockade of DAMPs and enhancing Siglec -10 / CD24 interactions, CD24Fc is 
capable of markedly reducing the inflammatory responses to DAMPs that  initiate acute GVHD; and 3) multiple established models of acute GVHD demonstrate that early administration of exogenous human CD24Fc, prior to infusion of donor cells, attenuates acute GVHD and improves survival after HCT.  
 
5.5 ADMINISTRATION  OF GVHD PROPHYLAXIS   
 5.5.1
 CD24F C  
 
For the single dose escalation cohorts , CD24Fc (study agent) will be administered 
intravenously  as a single dose on day -1 prior to HCT.  Subjects will also receive standard  
of care  GVHD prophylaxis  with methotrexate and tacrolimus . Attempts should be made

 to administer the CD24Fc  on schedule. The dose may be delayed up to 2 days  after its 
intended administration ( i.e. up to day 1 post HCT)  for unanticipated events such as 
toxicity  from preceding conditioning chemotherapy or infection . Administration of CD24Fc 
on a delayed schedule will not be a deviation but will be recorded and require approval 
from study PI or protocol chair.   
 For the multi -dose cohort  and the Phase IIa expansion cohort , CD24Fc  will be 
administered intravenously  on day -1 (480 mg) prior to HCT (day 0), and on day 14 (240 
mg) and day 28 (240 mg) post HCT.  Subjects will also receive standard of care  GVHD 
prophylaxis with methotrexate and tacrolimus. Attempts should be made to administer the CD24Fc on schedule and to ensure that at least 14 days of interval between dosing . The 
dose may not be delayed for the  first intended administration but may be delayed for  up 
to 4 days  for the second (i.e. on day 14 + 4) and the third administration (day 28 + 4 post 
HCT)  for unanticipated events such as toxicity from preceding conditioning 
chemotherapy, severe infection or scheduling. Administration of CD24Fc on a delayed 
schedule on day -1 will not be a deviation but will be recorded and require approval from 
study PI or protocol chair.  
 
5.5.2
 TACROLIMUS   
 
a. Tacrolimus will begin on day -3. IV or PO dosing is permitted. For intravenous dosing 
the recommended starting dose is 0.03 mg/kg/day based on adjusted body weight as a 
continuous infusion. For oral dosing the recommended starting dose is 0.045 mg/kg/dose 
twice daily.  
 b. Patients who cannot tolerate tacrolimus, then cyclosporine at a dose of 100x the intravenous tacrolimus dose (e.g., 3 mg/kg/day starting dose)  is recommended. For oral 
dosing the recommended conversion is 3x the intr avenous dose. When Neoral brand is 
used, because of greater bioavailability, the conversion is 2x the IV dose.  
 c. Tacrolimus will be switched to oral administration when applicable based on the 
patient’s ability to take oral medication generally  at a daily dose of three times the IV dose.   
 d. In the absence of GVHD, levels will be monitored for therapeutic dosing only during  the 
first 100 days post -transplant. The therapeutic target trough level for tacrolimus is  5-15 
ng/mL.  Tacrolimus  levels o utside of the desired range are not considered protocol 
deviations.  
 e. In the absence of GVHD  or relapse, it is recommended that tacrolimus tapering begin 
on day +100 post -transplant .  
 f. In the presence of GVHD, it is recommended that tacrolimus be  continued at the 
therapeutic dosing.

g. Patients who are unable to initiate standard or alternative prophylaxis (calcineurin inhibitor) will be removed from the study and replaced.  
 
5.5.3
 METHOTREXATE  
 
Methotrexate will be used in combination with tacrolimus for standard GVHD prophylaxis. 
Methotrexate will be given  intravenously  at a dose of 15 mg/m2/dose once daily  on Day 1 
after HCT, and at a dose of 10 mg/ m2/dose  on days 3, 6, and 11 after HCT . Attempts 
should be made to deliver  all four doses, however, methotrexate may  be omitted at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  Missed doses of methotrexat e will be recorded as a 
deviation, but will not constitute a protocol violation. Leucovorin rescue may also be administered  accord ing to local institutional practice guidelines.   
 
5.6 MYELOABLATIVE C ONDITIONING R EGIMENS 
 
Pre HCT c onditioning will be selected by the local investigator. Examples of 
acceptable regimens with dose ranges are outline d below:  
 
5.6.1
 BUSULFAN AND FLUDARABINE (BU/FLU) 
 
Days -5 to -2: Busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day IV or 130 mg /m2/day; total dose of 12.8 mg/kg or 
520 mg/m2, respectively) .  
Days -5 to -2: Flu (30 to 45 mg/m2/day, total dose of 120  - 180 mg/m2)  
 The specific sequence and timing  of busulfan and fludarabine administration in MAC 
regimens will be done according to institutional standards .  
 
5.6.2

 5.6.4 OTHER MYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING  
 
This trial is designed to study GVHD prevention in the general context of myeloablative conditioning, thus other myeloablative conditioning regimens are acceptable and do not constitute protocol deviation  so long as they fulfill CIBMTR myeloablative criter ia 
(APPENDIX B).  Incorporation of T cell depletion either ex vivo  or in vivo  (i.e. ATG, 
alemtuzumab) is prohibited.   
 
5.7 DONOR ELIGIBILITY, SELECTION, AND  RELATED  PROCEDURES  
Donor selection will be conducted according to local institution’s BMT clinical practice 
guidelines.  Participating HCT centers are registered and must remain in compliance with 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services FDA 21 CFR 1271.  Donors shall be 
assessed per National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) Donor Center and Apheresis 
Collection Center Procedures of Interaction  that will determine compliance with FDA 
donor eligibility regulations. Matched u nrelated donor prod ucts undergo comprehensive  
medical  screening to determine that the donor is free of risk factors for infection due to 
relevant communicable diseases, as well as testing for relevant communicable disease 
agents  prior to administration.    
No sibling, cord, haploidentical or syngeneic donors are eligible.  
The source of donor stem cells will be peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow 
(BM).  
PBSC should be infused into the patient on the same day of collection  whenever possible. 
However, given logistics of unrelated donor collections, unrelated PBSC may be infused 
within 48h of collection.  
For PBSC: The recommended stem cells dose i s ≥ 5.0 to 10 x 10
6 CD34 cells/kg recipient 
weight.  
For BM infusions: The recommended cell dose is ≥  2.0 x 108 mononuclear cells/kg 
recipient weight.  
Note: The day of the stem cell/marrow infusion will be defined as day 0. If more than one 
day of infusion is required, then these days are defined as day 0a, day 0b accordingly. 
The first day after the last stem cell infusion will be defined as day 1.   
 
5.8 POST -TRANSPLANT SUP PORTIVE CARE 
Post- transplant supportive care outside of the scope of what is delineated in this protocol , 
for instance infection  prophylaxis , will be conducted as per the local institution’s BMT  
clinical practice g uidelines.

 5.8.1   GROWTH FACTORS  
G-CSF may be given per institutional guidelines.  
 
5.8.2   SEIZURE PROPHYLAXIS  
Keppra (Levetiracetam) will be administered for the prevention of busulfan- associated 
seizures  to all participants receiving busulfan. Typically, this will involve initiation of 
Levetiracetam 12 hours prior to Busulfan through 48 hours after last dosage. Specifics 
of Dosing of Levetiracetam will be administered as per the institutions BMT guidelines . 
Alternatively, Phenytoin or another similar seizure prophylaxis agents  may be 
administered starting prior to starting busulfan for the prevention of busulfan- associated 
seizures, according to institutional practices.  
 
5.8.3   BLOOD PRODUCTS  
Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be consistent with the standard 
institutional guidelines. All blood products will be irradiated.  
 
5.8.4   PROPHYLAXIS AGAINST INFECTIONS  
Patients will receive infection prophylaxis according to institutional guideli nes. Infection  
prophylaxis should include, but is not limited to, agents or strategies (e.g., PCR screening and preemptive therapy) to reduce the risk of bacterial, Herpes simplex, 
CMV, EBV, Pneumocystis  jiroveci and fungal infections:  
  
 5.8.4.1 ANTIFUNGA L THERAPY:  
Prophylaxis with fluconazole or other antifungal agents will be given as per local 
institutional guidelines. Fluconazole, voriconazole and other azoles  are expected 
to increase serum cyclosporine or tacrolimus levels, therefore, dosages of  
cyclosporine or tacrolimus should be adjusted accordingly.  
 
 5.8.4.2 CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV):  
CMV monitoring will be done according to institutional guidelines. It is 
recommended that at minimum  weekly assessment for CMV be done through 
Day 60 post -transpla nt, and then at each clinical assessment until day 180 post -
transplant. Any reactivation of CMV necessitating treatment and/or CMV end 
organ disease (enteritis, pneumonitis) will be captured in this study. Preemptive 
treatment (early treatment of CMV viremia detected by PCR) is the preferred 
strategy for the majority of patients.   Patients receiving CMV prophylaxis with 
FDA approved agents (Letermovir) will be recorded. Other investigational agents for CMV prevention should be avoided while on study treatment.   It is 
recommended that the threshold to initiate preemptive therapy will be according to a value determined by the assay being performed at the institution or a rising

 trend on successive measurements from patient’s baseline. As an example, 
when using an FDA approved assay that has been calibrated, using WHO CMV standards, a threshold of 3000 international units (IU)/mL may be used.  
 5.8.4.3 EPSTEIN -BARR VIRUS ( EBV) : 
EBV monitoring will be done according to institutional guidelines. Any reactivation of EBV necessitating treatment and/or EBV -related post -transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease will be captured in this study.
 
 5.8.5.4 PNEUMOCYSTIS  JIROVECI:  
Prophylaxis with Bactrim or other agents directed against Pneumocystis jiroveci must be administered where clinically feasible per local institutional guidelines.  
 5.8.4.5 HERPES VIRUS (HSV OR VZV):  
Patients must receive acyclovir or valacyclovir through Day  365 post -transplant 
as standard prophylaxis against HSV and VZV per institutional gui delines or until 
the CD4 T -cell count has normalized.  
 
5.8.5   SINUSOIDAL OBSTRUCTION SYNDROME (SOS)  / VENO-OCCLUSIVE DISEASE (VOD)  OF 
THE LIVER 
 
Prophylaxis against SOS/VOD with ursodiol will be administered according to local 
institutional standard practice.  
 
5.8.6   DONOR LYPHOCYTE INFUSIONS – VIRAL-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXIC T-LYPHOCYTES (CTL S) 
Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) should only be performed for therapeutic reasons, 
including  but not limited to relapsed or persistent disease or refractory infections. DLI 
should not be  administered for mixed chimerism only.  
 
5.8.7  INTRAVENOUS IMMUNE GLOBULIN (IVIG).   
IVIG administration for treatment and prevention of infection will be per local institutional 
practice.  
6.0 STUDY DEFINITIONS  
 
a. Screening.  A patient is considered to be in the “Screening” period from the time they  
sign consent until the date the eligibility criteria has been determined as either “eligible”  
or “ineligible” (screen failure). Patients may be consented to this trial based on disease 
control at the time of consent, but later removed from the trial prior to initiation of

 transplant conditioning regimen if disease status confirmation between consenting and 
transplant changes. In the event this occurs, these patients will  be replaced.  
 b. Enrolled.  A patient is considered to be “Enrolled” onto the study once they have signed 
consent and have successfully met all screening criteria, as documented by the  
inclusion/exclusion document,  and m ulti-site coordinator confirms  these data.   The dat e 
of enrollment will be documented as  date of notification from the multi -site coordinator . 
 c. Treatment Period.  The “Treatment Period” is defined as the first day of treatment with 
CD24Fc  until 30 days  after HCT  for the single- dosing  cohorts or 60 days after HCT for 
the multi -dose and expansion cohort .  The exact days may  vary depending on the last 
day of administration of study drug without constituting a deviation. The assessment and 
reporting period for adverse events (AE)  including dose limiting toxicities potentially  
related to the study drug (CD24Fc) will extend through day 30 or day 60 post HCT . Based 
upon PK data for CD24Fc this time period will allow for passage of greater than two half -
lives.   
 d. Follow Up Period: The “Follow Up” period is defined as the first day the patient is no  
longer within the treatment period (i.e. day 31 or day 61) until the subject comes off study .  
The follow -up period can be up to 4 years post HCT.  During this tim e subjects will be 
followed for GVHD  (acute and chronic) , relapse, and  survival .  Data collection after one 
year post HCT will be minimal and can be an office visit, phone contact or review of the 
subject’s medical chart .  Outcome information collected on other BMT program c linical 
research studies may be analyzed in relation to patients participating in this study.  
 e. On Study: The “On Study” period is defined as the day the patient signs the protocol 
consent document and meets the protocol eligibility criteria (“Enrolled”), until the subject comes off study. Patients can be taken off study at any time at their own req uest, or they 
may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons.  
 f. Off Treatment: The “Off Treatment” period is  generally  defined as the time period where 
the patient completes the study drug  treatmen t period (Day 30  for the single- dosing 
cohorts or Day 60 for the multi -dosing cohort ) or if one or more of  the following criteria 
are met : 
• Death  
• Lost to follow up 
• Entry on to a competing trial  
• Withdrawal of consent by the patient or PI for any further treatment and follow up 
observations  
• Grade III-IV Acute GVHD requiring high dose corticosteroid therapy  
• Relapse of the underlying malignancy or development of new malignancy  
• Unacceptable or dose limiting toxicity or complication

Note: Subjects wi ll be continuously monitored for adverse event s per local institutional 
guidelines  through day 60 post-HCT (e.g. for routine post HCT care and measurement of 
primary clinical endpoint of acute GVHD)  and then at minimum quarterly through one 
year. Adverse events occurring beyond day 60 post -HCT will be evaluated, monitored 
and recor ded but  not be reported unless related (probably or definitely) to the study drug 
(CD24Fc ).  
 g. Definition of engraftment and engraftment failure: 
 Engraftment: Engraftment for neutrophils is defined as the first of three consecutive days 
in which the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is > 500/uL. Engraftment for platelets is defined as the first of three consecutive days in which the platelet count is > 20,000/uL, without transfusion support.  
 Primary engraftment failure: will be defined as ongoing ANC <500/uL by day 28 post H CT. 
Failure to attain platelet count ≥  20,000/uL  will not be considered engraftment failure.  
Patients who engraft prior to day 28 and later have ANC < 500/uL or platelet transfusion 
requirements, as frequently occurs in HCT patients due to infection and other complications will not be considered to have engraftment  failure . 
7.0 MANAGING TOXICITIE S 
7.1 MANAGING INFUSION RE ACTIONS  
Infusion reactions were not observed in the Phase 1 and Phase IIa clinical trials. However, 
the administration of any recombinant protein has the potential to elicit infusion reactions. 
CD24Fc includes the Fc portion of human IgG1. After target binding, CD24Fc may induce FcγR cross- linking, which has been associated with infusion reactions for som e 
therapeutics . 
Infusion reactions  may include events  such as changes in vital signs, fever, difficulty 
breathing, hypotension, generalized or facial edema, nausea, chills, mental status changes, urticaria  or vomiting during or up to 2 hours following infusion.  
Outlined below are generalized procedures designed to closely monitor,  minimize and 
manage any potential infusion reactions:  
1) CD24Fc  dosing can be administere d in an inpatient  or an outpatient  hospital unit .  
Patient should be closely monitored during CD24Fc administration.  Sites should also 
follow -up with the patient within 24 hours post CD24Fc administration.   
2) The duration of the infusion will be over  a minimum of 60 minutes . The IV rate may be 
reduced to prolong the duration of infusion at the discretion of the investigator and clinical 
team based upon symptoms suggestive of an infusion- related reaction. If an infusion 
reaction is deemed severe (e.g. severe hypotension, hypoxemia)  the infusion should be 
stopped.

40 
CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 3) Supportive care  will be provided as clinically indicated and commiserate with the 
intensity of the infusion reaction. These measures may include  supplemental oxygen, 
diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen,  IV corticosteroids (i.e. hydrocortisone)  and 
iv fluids .  
4) In accordance with the preparedness for treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, severe 
infusion reactions, and/or  cytokine release syndrome emergency resuscitation 
equipment, advanced cardiac life support equipment, and medications (e.g. epinephrine  
kit) must be readily available at the bedside during CD24Fc administration.  
 
7.2 MANAGING ACUTE GVHD  
a. Acute GVHD will be graded and recorded according to consensus guidelines utilized 
by international CIBMTR registry  and Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials 
Network  (APPENDIX C).  Patients are evaluable for the primary endpoint of acute GVHD  
following receipt of HCT on day 0 until day 180 after HCT. Assessment for the secondary  
endpoints of late onset acute GVHD or chronic  GVHD endpoint s will continue until one 
year after HCT . Acute  GVHD secondary to disease relapse treatments such as reduction 
of immunosuppressive agents or administration of immunotherapy drugs and targeted 
therapy drugs should be graded and recorded according to consensus guidelines until day 180 after HCT.  
 b. The diagnosis and severity of GVHD will be determined clinically  (see APPENDIX C, 
adults) . If stool volumes are incomplete or not recorded stool frequency may be 
considered in grading assessment [67]. Biopsies of affected organs are strongly  
encouraged whenever possible.   Overall acute GVHD will be  assessed and  graded 
weekly through day +100 after transplant,  then at minimum month from Day 100 to Day 
180 with quarterly thereafter . The first day of GVHD of a certain clinical grade will be 
counted as the day of onset. The first day of maximum GVHD severity will also be recorded.  Diagnosis of  Stage I GVHD of the gut (grade  II overall) that involves the 
upper GI tract (e.g. with stool volumes < 500ml/day) requires biopsy  with histologic 
evidence of GVHD  for confirmation.   
 c. Individual organ stages will be scored by the attending physician. Stages will be reviewed by the PI, including reasons for declaring an individual organ potentially  un-
evaluable.  For example, elevated indirect bilirubin consistent with acute hemolysis may 
impede liver specific GVHD grading.  
 d. Discrepant GVHD scores will be reviewed by at least 1 investigator who will resolve the discrepancies (which may/may not include the use of a third, independent  evaluation  
adjudication committee ). 
 e. If a patient develops acute GVHD, treatment with standard of care is recommended  
according to institutional BMT program clinical practice guidelines (e.g. 2 mg/kg/day  of

 prednisone  or equivalent) . Other GVHD therapy, including immunosuppressives can be 
added at the discretion of the treating physician.   
8.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS BASED ON LABORATORY VALUES  
8.1 RENAL F UNCTION 
 
If estimated GFR is less than 30 mL/min dosing will be held. If GFR recovers  to greater 
than 30  mL/min within the protocol defined treatment period window  then CD24Fc may 
be resumed.  
 
8.2 HEPATIC F UNCTION 
 
Patients receiving HCT with myeloablative conditioning may have transient elevations i n 
LFTs and total bilirubin. However, if ALT or AST is greater than 20 times above the upper 
limit of normal  (≥ grade 4 CTCAE v4.0 ALT/ST elevation)  OR total bilirubin ≥ 5 mg/dl, 
CD24Fc  will be t emporarily suspended. If ALT, AST, and total bilirubin fall to  < 5 x upper 
limit of normal (< grade 2 CTCAEv4.0) OR total bilirubin falls to < 2.5mg/dl  within the 
protocol defined treatment period ( up to Day +1) then CD24Fc may be administered.  
 
9.0 REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS (STUDY CALENDAR ): 
In general , pre- and post - HCT care will follow  local BMT program clinical practice 
guidelines  for myeloablative conditioning . For example, routine history, physical, organ 
function testing (PFT, Echocardiogram ), and laboratory evaluations (including serologic 
and/or PCR based viral studies)  will follow  institutional practice guidelines . The follow ing 
assessments /samples  will be obtained pre- therapy and post -therapy  for the single- dose 
cohorts ( Table 5A), the multi -dosing cohort (Table 5B), and the expansion cohort (Table 
5C). These procedures  will be co nducted as required observations for study  unless 
indicated otherwise.

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 NOTE : Pre and Post- transplant observations.  Patient condition and scheduling issues may impact the time of post -HCT obser vation s. The acceptable time 
frame for completing these observations is ±  3 days through da y 30, ± 5 days for observations  from day 31  until  day 100, and ± 7 to 14 days for observat ions 
from day 100 to  day 365. Collection windows do not apply to early PK studies which should be collected  around the time of CD24Fc infusion.      
1) Per institution practice guidelines: Recipient organ function testing w ill include MUGA or Echocardiography , Electrocardiogram,  and Pulmonary Function Testing. 
Donor safety and eligibility assessments and screening for infectious disease markers  will be performed according to national marrow donor program (NMDP) 
guidelines.  These include  but are not limited to screening for  HIV, Hep atitis B and C , HTLV I/II, HSV antibody, Trypanosoma cruzi , west nile virus, syphilis  and 
CMV .  The Pulmonary Function Test may be assessed  up to 6 weeks prior to enrollment.   
2) Laboratory tests include  CBC with differential , serum chemistries  with creatinine, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin in pre -HCT period.  CBC with differential, serum 
electrolytes with creatinine, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin will be performed at a minimum  on the day  of CD24Fc  infusion and three times weekly from day 0 until 
ANC > 500/ul , while hospitalized for HCT.  Tacrolimus levels will be monitored at a minimum of three times (e.g. every 48-72 hours) for the first week post CD24fc 
infusion (day 0 to day 7) and then per institution clinical practice guidelines. CBC with differential, serum electrolytes with creatinine, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin 
then performed weekly through day 29 and performed every other week through day 100 post HCT.  Laboratory testing may be more frequent per standard HCT 
practice.    
3) 12 lead ECG monitoring will be performed at 3 time points to assess cardiac safety signals.  On Day -1, the ECG should be measured within four hours of start 
of study drug infusion and 2 hours (± 15 minutes) post drug (i.e. 2 hours after the start of infusion). ECG should be measured 3 hours  (± 15 min)  post drug in 
the 960mg dosing cohort due to prolonged infusion time (i.e. 3 hours  after the start of infusion) . 
4) Per protocol, CD24Fc will be administered on day -1. See protocol section 7.1 for instructions on identifying and managing infusion reactions.  
5) Frequent vital sign monitoring is required following CD24Fc infusion. Vital signs will be recorded prior to infu sion and at approximately 15, 30, 60, and 120 
minutes from the start of the  CD24Fc  infusion.   
6) Assessment for acute GVHD will occur weekly through day 100. Following day 100 acute and chronic GVHD assessments will occur  approximately at a quarterly 
schedul e (day 180 and day 270 ± 14 day s).  Consensus acute GVHD grading will be used to report disease severity (APPENDIX C)  
7) Research samples include PBSC and serum from subjects at indicated time points  to be cyropreserved for correlative immunologic studie s.  
8)  In the pre-HCT period, a research sample from the donor HCT product will also be cryopreserved prior to infusion.

 10.0 RESEARCH SAMPLE S 
10.1 RESEARCH BLOOD S AMPLES 
10.1.1  PHASE IIA - SINGLE DOSE AND MULTI-DOSE COHORTS  
Research samples  (approximately 28 ml) and PK/ADA samples ( approximately 8 ml) will 
be obtained from the peripheral blood per time point  (up to approximately  36 mL total ) 
from each patient at 5 (single dose) or 7 (multi -dose)  and 7  (single dose) or 13 (multi -
dose)  planned time points , respectively,  during the course of the study .  An additional  
sample will be drawn at time of GVHD onset, if applicable. Samples will be collected 
coincident with routine blood draws on the patients . In addition, one  hepariniz ed blood 
sample (approximately 2 mL) will be taken from the donor stem cell grafts  once prior to 
administration  to the recipient  (Day 0) .  
Research s amples  will be obtained at the following time points for the single dose cohorts: 
at baseline on day -7 (±5) prior to initiating conditioning  and then prior to  study  drug 
infusion on day -1, day +14 (±3), day + 30 (±5) and day +100 ( ±7).  Research samples will 
be obtained at the following time points for the multi -dose cohort: at baseline on day -7 
(±5) prior to initiating conditioning,  prior to study drug infusion on day -1, day 14 ( ±4), day 
28 (±4), day 42 ( ±5), day 56 ( ±5) and day +100 (±7). PBMCs and serum will be isolated 
and frozen for future analysis. All samples will be processed, frozen, and banked in the 
Immunology Core Lab at the University of Michigan.  
For PK and anti-drug antibody (ADA) analysis  in the single dose cohorts , blood samples  
will be collected prior to study  drug infusion and 2 hours (±30 minutes) after completing 
the CD24Fc  infusion  on day -1 and on days +7 (±2), +14 (±3), +30 (±5), +42 (±5), and 
+100 (±7).  For the multi -dose cohort, PK/ADA samples will be collected prior to study 
drug infusion and 2 hours after  completing  study drug infusion on day -1, day +14 and 
day +28 (Note: these days should be adjusted to the precise day of infusion if the CD24Fc 
is delayed for any reason) .  Samples will also be collected days  +7 (±2), +21 (±3), +35 
(±5), +42 (±5), +56 (±5), +70 (±5)  and +100 (±7) after HCT . ADA will be tested on the 
samples from pre- infusion ( -1 day), day 60 and day 100. PK and ADA will be measured 
using validated assay s in a G LP-compliant laboratory that performed  these analyses for  
the Phase I study . Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using actual collection 
times. The PK parameters for CD24Fc (Cmax, Tmax, kel, t½, AUC0- 42d, AUC0- inf, 
AUCextr, CL, and Vd) will be calculated from the individual plasma concentrations profile by non- compartmental approaches . In patients with pre- existing or induced ADA, we will 
determine whether the ADA affects PK of the drug, although the results from the  Phase I 
study demonstrated that a small number of patients with either  pre-existing or induced 
ADA have similar PK to subjects without ADA.   
 
10.1.2
 – PHASE IIA – EXPANSION COHORT  
Research samples  (approximately 28 ml) will be obtained from the peripheral blood per 
time point  from each patient at the time points marked in Table 5C .

 10.2 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
10.2.1  OVERVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : 
The aim s of the correlative studies will be  to explore the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics (PD)  and immunologic impact  of CD24Fc administration on human 
immune subsets following allogeneic HCT. For these studies, samples will be obtained 
before infusion into the patient and at time points  after infusion in the presence of CD24Fc, 
such that each patient serves as their own internal control. These data will then be 
aggregated and used for comparisons to time matched controls  not receiving CD24Fc  
available within the U niversity  of Michigan  biorepository  (HUM#48783). Additionally , the 
randomized, double blind, placebo controll ed, compon ent of the trial will facilitate 
contemporaneous comparisons between subjects receiving  standard GVHD prophylaxis 
with or without  CD24Fc.  This design will enable robust intra- patient comparisons.  
Correlative experiments will be designed and conducted by the laboratory of Dr. Pavan 
Reddy (Univ. of Michigan)  and OncoImmune, or at a designated contract research 
organization. Any human samples sent for analysis by external collaborators  including 
OncoImmune, I nc. and their designated CRO  will be de-identified  by coding  to protect 
subject personal health information.  
 
10.2.2  PD AND IMMUNOLOGIC STUDIES : 
Cryopreserved specimens will be utilized as indicated for exploratory  PD and 
immunologic studies to evaluate the effects of CD24Fc which includes but is not limited 
to the following analysis:  
PD studies : will evaluate  Siglec -10  intracellular phosphorylation status  of SHP -1, and 
activation status of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF -kB) components  within  immune subsets, 
namely  APCs and T cells.   
Cellular immunology correlatives : will examine a) Ex vivo T cell responses (cytokine 
release, proliferation) to DCs from patients treated with and without CD24Fc ; b) T cell 
phenotyping , to assess expression of CD44, CD62L, CD25, PD- 1, PDL -1, CD127 and 
intracellular staining of Foxp3, IFN -γ, and IL- 17 to identify CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs, 
naïve (CD45RA+), memory (CD45RO+) T cells  and additional T cell subsets ; c) NK cell  
subsets ; d) B-cell subsets ; e) Treg and conventional T cell functional responses to 
nominal and specific antigens and f) anti -drug antibody levels.   
Inflammatory mediators and biomarkers of GVHD : will include a ) pro -inflammatory 
cytokines (TNFα, IL- 1, IL -6, IL -8, others ); b) previously established plasma GVHD 
biomarkers [62] and c ) DAMPs (HMGB1, uric acid, ATP,  etc.).  
Lipids:  Lipid panel, Low -density lipoprotein (LDL), High- density lipoprotein (HDL), 
Triglycerides, and Total cholesterol .  
The laboratory of  Dr. Pavan Reddy  has extensive  experience in successfully completing 
these  immunologic  assays.

10.3 ADDITIONAL RESEAR CH S AMPLES  
Additional samples will be collected with a suspected new diagnosis of acute GVHD . 
Attempts will be made to obtain samples in a timely fashion before treatment is initiated. 
However, treatment will not be delayed while awaiting sample procurement. Obtaining 
samples for research purposes are secondary, not primary objective of this study. As such, failure to have a research sample drawn at any time point will not be considered a protocol violation.  
 
11.0 PHARMAC EUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
11.1 CD24FC OR CD24IGG  (ONCOIMMUNE, INC.), STUDY AGENT  
 
CD24Fc (CD24 Ig) is a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of mature human CD24 linked to the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc domain. 
 
11.1.1
 MOLECULAR FORMULA AND FORMULATION  
 
The complete molecular formula of CD24Fc has not been determined at this time.  The 
mature protein is 261 amino acids long  and each CD24Fc molecule includes the 30 amino 
acid CD24 extracellular domain. CD24Fc forms a disulfide- linked homodimer with a 
predicted mass of 57.7 kilodaltons (kDa) based on the homodimer amino acid sequence.  However, the apparent molecular weight of the intact dimer is approximately 80 KDa 
based on non- reduced SDS -PAGE. The CD24 domain is highly glycosylated with both N -
linked and O -linked oligosaccharides, which comprise approximately 80% of the mass of 
the CD24 domain.    
 CD24Fc has been formulated as single dose injection solution, at a concentration of 10  
mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline at  pH 7.2.  Each 20 mL CD24Fc Drug Product vial 
contains 160 mg of CD24Fc  in 16  mL ± 0.2 mL (Lot 09MM -036) or 120 mg of CD24Fc  in 
12 mL ± 0.2 mL (Lot 0118- 002).

CD24Fc is supplied as a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative- free aqueous solution for 
parenteral administration.  CD24Fc is stored at -20° C until use.  CD24Fc should be 
thawed and equilibrated to room temperature prior to administration.  CD24Fc Drug Product  used in the Phase I and Phase IIa trials (Lot 09MM -036) is stable for at least 66 
months at -20
oC, for 6 months at 5°C  and 3 months at 25oC. New CD24Fc Drug Product 
has been manufactured for the Phase IIa - Expansion trial (Lot 0118- 002). Stabil ity 
studies for Lot 0118 -002 are ongoing  and it has demonstrated to be stable for six month s 
at the intended storage temperature, -20oC, for 6 months at 5oC and 1 month at 25°C. 
 
11.1.4 ADMINISTRATION  
 
CD24Fc at doses up to 480 mg (i.e. dose  levels -1, 0, 1  and 2; see Section 17.2.1) will be 
prepared in a diluent comprising 0.9% Sodium Chloride in a volume of 100 ml and be 
administrated by intravenous infusion over a minimum of 60 minutes.   
  
11.1. 5
 PRECLINICAL SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY  
 
The safety pharmacology assessments were included as part of the toxicity studies 
performed in mice and monkeys. The mouse study was performed by JOINN Laboratory 
at Beijing, China, while the cynomolgus monkey study was carried out by Charles River Laboratory at Reno, Nevada, USA. Both studies are in compliance with the Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP) and the final reports were audited.  
 
11.1. 6
 A 4-W EEK INTRAVENOUS TOXICITY STUDY OF CD24F C IN MICE WITH A 4-W EEK 
RECOVERY PERIOD  
 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the toxicity and systemic exposure of CD24Fc when intravenously administered to mice once weekly for four weeks and the reversibility of toxicity following a four -week recovery period. A total of 320 male and 
female mice were assigned to Groups 1- 4 for evaluation of the toxicity (20/sex/group)  and 
reversibility (20/sex/group). All of these mice were treated intravenously with either PBS buffer or CD24Fc at doses of 12.5, 35, or 125 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. A total of 360 mice were assigned to Groups 5- 8 for evaluation of the systemic exposure of CD24Fc  
following the first dose (3/sex in Group 5 and 27/sex/group in Groups 6- 8) and the last 
dose (6/sex in Group 5 and 30/sex/group in Groups 6- 8.). All of these mice were treated

 intravenously with either PBS buffer or CD24Fc at doses of 12.5, 35, or 125 mg/kg once 
on Day 1 or once weekly for 4 weeks.  
 
No morbidity or mortality were found in all mice treated with either PBS buffer or CD24Fc  
with the exception that one male mouse treated with 35 mg/kg of CD24Fc  in Group 7 was 
found dead on Day 21 . This death occurred in 1/680 of mice and did not appear to be 
associated with the treatment. No treatment -related changes were noted in clinical 
observations, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, org an weights, and organ- to-body or to- brain weight ratios. No 
treatment -related macroscopic and microscopic findings were observed in all examined 
animals.  
 Anti-CD24Fc  antibody was detected in 10/30 of mice on Day 30 and 12/30 of mice on 
Day 57, which appeared to be dose dependent with no difference between male and female mice. Higher systemic exposure following the first dose and last dose in male animals were observed than in female animals. An approximately linear increase in AUC value was observed when mice treated with CD24Fc  from 12.5 mg/kg to 125 mg/kg. An 
accumulation of CD24Fc  in mice was observed after dosing once weekly for four weeks.  
 In summary, no observed adverse effects were noted in mice treated with CD24Fc  at 
doses of 12.5, 35 or 125 mg/k g once weekly for 4 weeks with a 4 week recovery period. 
The NOAEL was considered to be equal to or greater than 125 mg/kg.  
 
11.1. 7
 A 4-W EEK TOXICITY STUDY OF CD24F C ADMINISTERED BY INTRAVENOUS INFUSION TO 
CYNOMOLGUS MONKEYS , WITH A 10-W EEK RECOVERY PERIOD  
 
The objectives of this study were to examine the pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity, acquired immunity, and immunogenicity following administration of CD24Fc administered by intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks, and to evaluate recovery f rom any 
effects of the test article over a dose- free period of at least 10 weeks. The test article, 
CD24Fc and the control article, 1X phosphate- buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2 were 
supplied by the Sponsor as a clear, colorless, preformulated aqueous solution and by the Testing Facility as a preformulated aqueous solution, respectively. The test article formulation provided by the Sponsor was used as received for dose administration.  
 Forty experimentally naive cynomolgus monkeys (20 males and 20 females), 2.9 to 4.7 years of age for the males and 2.9 to 5.0 years of age for the females, and weighing 2.1 to 3.2 kg for the males and 2.2 to 2.9 kg for the females at the outset (Day -1) of the study. 
All animals were dosed via 1- hour intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 consecutive 
weeks. The first day of dosing was designated Day 1 (04 and 05 Sep 2009, Sets A and B, respectively). The animals were evaluated for changes in clinical signs (evaluations of morbidity and/or mortality [twice daily] and cage side observations [once daily], body weight (Weeks -2 and –1, and weekly thereafter), electrocardiography (prestudy and Day

 28), ophthalmology (prestudy and Day 28), and clinical pathology indices (including 
serum chemistry, hematology, and coagulation (three pres tudy and Days 28 and 98), and 
urinalysis [via cystocentesis on Days 28 and 98]). Blood samples were collected for toxicokinetic analysis predose, 15 minutes, and 6, 24, and 72 hours in relation to dose administration on Days 1 and 22, predose on Day 8, and on Day 29 (at the same time of 
day as Day 22 end of infusion). Blood samples for flow cytometry were collected prestudy (three time points), and on Days 28 and 98. Blood samples for anti -drug antibodies (ADA) 
were collected prestudy and on Days 28 and 98.  At termination, a full necropsy was 
conducted on all animals, and tissues were collected, preserved, processed, and examined microscopically by a Study Pathologist certified by the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (ACVP).  
 The results showed that CD24Fc administered via 1- hour intravenous infusion once 
weekly for 4 consecutive weeks at 12.5 mg/kg/week (Group 2), 35 mg/kg/week (Group 3), or 125 mg/kg/week (Group 4) was generally well tolerated in male and female cynomolgus monkeys through a 4- week dosing period, followed by a 10 week recovery 
period. There were no CD24Fc -related changes in clinical observations, food 
consumption, body weights, electrocardiographic measurements, ophthalmic examinations, serum chemistry (one exception noted below),  coagulation, urinalysis 
parameters, macroscopic findings, or organ weights or organ weight ratios. There were no CD24Fc -related changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subset counts obtained 
by flow cytometry, or anti -KLH immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to KLH challenge.  
 There was a possible CD24Fc -related approximately 2- fold increase in alkaline 
phosphatase ( ALP), an indicator of liver function,  for one male administered 35 
mg/kg/week at Day 98 compared to predose and Day 28 values.  
 There was a possible CD24Fc -related slight decrease in hemoglobin at Day 28 for 35 
mg/kg/week males. The magnitude and/or nature of these changes were not considered adverse in this study.  
 On Day 28, one male administered 35 mg/kg/week had an approximate 13% decrease in 
hemoglobin concentration. On Day 98 (76 days after the last dose), changes in hematology for this animal included a 21% decrease in hemoglobin, a 16% increase in red blood cell counts, a 21% decrease in mean cell volume (MCV), a 32% decrease in mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), a 14% decrease in mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), a 24% increase in red cell distribution width (RDW), and an approximately 2-fold increase in platelet and reticulocyte counts compared to prestudy (Day -2) levels. 
Day 98 blood smear analysis documented hypochromic red blood cells, microcytosis, anisocytosis, schistocytes, poikilocytes, and spherocytes, as well as an apparent increase in platelet numbers. These hematology changes are not considered typical findings in cynomolgus monkeys at this Testing Facility. However, no corresponding histopathology abnormalities were identified, and these hematology findings were not observed in any other animals in the mid- dose (35 mg/kg/week) or high- dose (125 mg/kg/week) groups.

At recovery necropsy, histopathologic analysis of the following subset of tissues was performed based on clinical pathology or gross findings: all tissues except for mammary glands from a male administered 35 mg/kg/week, the duodenum from another male administered  35 mg/kg/week, and testes from one male administered 125 mg/kg/week. 
No microscopic findings were found related to the administration of CD24Fc.  
 CD24Fc was detected in serum samples from all dosed animals. No measurable amount of CD24Fc was detected in control or predose serum samples. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was performed, and the results met the acceptance criteria.  
 Serum was screened for the presence of anti -CD24Fc antibody. Seven animals out of the 
40 total were identified as positive at the  prestudy time point (17.5%). This rate of positive 
samples prior to test article administration is similar to the rate observed in the validation (12.5%) which demonstrated a subpopulation of animals with pre- existing anti -CD24Fc 
antibodies. Three animals  were identified as positive during the dosing period of the 
study , two of which were positive at the prestudy timepoint. The validation experiment 
also demonstrated that 10 μg/mL of CD24Fc inhibited the measurement of anti -CD24Fc 
antibodies in reference to the positive control, and all dose groups at the Day 29 toxicokinetic time point had concentrations greater than 10 μg/mL measured in serum. Only one animal (125 mg/kg/week dose group) screened positive for anti -CD24Fc 
antibodies within the recovery interval.  
 Based on the hematology findings, the no- observed- adverse- effect level (NOAEL) for  
CD24Fc was considered to be 12.5 mg/kg/week under the conditions of this study when administered once weekly for four weeks.  
 
11.1. 8 SAFETY IN HUMANS  
 
11.1.8.1  PHASE 1 SAFETY DATA  
A Phase I, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose study to 
assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of CD24Fc in healthy male and female adult subjects  was conducted. Details are also provided in section 3. 8 A total of 40 subjects 
were randomized in 5 cohorts of 8 subjects each, and 39 subjects completed the study. CD24Fc was administered via IV infusion over 1 hour. In total, 18 (45.0%) subjects had a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the study: 6 (60.0%) subjects in the 
placebo group, 2 (33.3%) subjects in the CD24Fc 10 mg group, 3 (50.0%) subjects in the CD24Fc 30 mg group, 2 (33.3%) subjects in the CD24Fc 60 mg group, 3 (50.0%) subjects in the CD24Fc 120 mg group, and 2 (33.3%) subjects in the CD24Fc 240 mg group.  
 All TEAEs in the study were considered mild to moderate in severity by the Investigator except for 1 subject in the placebo group who experienced a severe headache. The most 
common TEAEs were headache (6 [15.0%] subjects), burns second degree (3 [7.5%]

 subjects), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (2 [5.0%] subjects), and upper 
respiratory tract infection (2 [5.0%] subjects).  
 
Overall, 5 (12.5%) subjects had a study drug -related TEAE: 1 (10.0%) subject in the 
placebo group, 2 (33.3%) subjects in the CD24Fc 10 mg group, 1 (16.7%) subject in the CD24Fc 30 mg group, and 1 (16.7%) subject in the CD24Fc 60 mg group. The study drug-related TEAEs during the study were headache (4 [10.0%] subjects) and ventricular 
tachycardia (1 [2.5%] subject). A drug -related SAE of ventricular tachycardia was 
experienced by 1 (16.7%) subject in the CD24Fc 60 mg group. This SAE occurred at a rate comparable with normal populations, was considered mild by the Investigator, and did not lead to discontinuation from the study. No subjects died during the study and no 
subjects discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. There were no clinically 
meaningful changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECGs, or physical exams during the study.  
 
11.1.8.2  PHASE IIA SAFETY DATA  
The number  of subjects with TEAEs from Day -1 to 30 or 60 days after the last dosing 
was the same between all treatment  groups : 6 (100.0%) patients in the 240 mg CD24Fc 
single dose cohort, 6  (100.0%)  patients in the 480 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort, 
6 (100.0%) patients in the 480/240/240 mg multiple dose cohort, and 6 (100.0%) patients 
who received placebo experienced TEAEs.  
The most common TEAEs were stomatitis (6 [100.0%] patients in the 240 mg CD24Fc 
single dose c ohort, 6 [100.0%] patients in the 480 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort, 5 
[83.3%] patients in the 480/240/240 mg CD24Fc multiple dose cohort, and 6 [100.0%] 
patients who received placebo); platelet count decreased (6 [100.0%] patients in the 240 mg CD24Fc sing le dose cohort, 6 [100.0%]  patients in the 480 mg CD24Fc single dose 
cohort, 5 [83.3%] patients in the 480/240/240  mg CD24Fc multiple dose cohort, and 5 
[83.3%] patients who received placebo); white blood cell count decreased (6 [100.0%] patients in the 240 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort, 6 [100.0%]  patients in the 480 mg 
CD24Fc single dose cohort, 5 [83.3%] patients in the 480/240/240 mg CD24Fc multiple 
dose cohort, and 4 [66.7%] patients who received placebo). Severe stomatitis ( ≥ Grade 
3) occurred in 3 (50.0%) patients in the 240 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort, 
4 (66.7%)  patients in the 480 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort, 2 (33.3%) patients in the 
480/240/240 mg CD24Fc multiple dose cohort, and 5 (83.3%) patients who received 
placebo, with a clear inverse correlation between CD24Fc doses and duration of severe stomatitis.  
One (16.7%) patient in the 480 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort and 2 (33.3%) patients 
who received placebo experienced a study drug -related TEAE. The most common study 
drug-related TEAE was diarrhea (1  [16.7%]  patient in the 480 mg CD24Fc single dose 
cohort and 2 [33.3%] patients who received placebo). No patients in other cohorts 
experienced a study drug -related TEAE.

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 The incidence of Grade 3/4/5 TEAEs was the same between all treatments: 6 (100.0%) 
patients in the 240 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort, 6 (100.0%) patients in the 480 mg 
single dose cohort, 6 (100.0%)  patients in the 480/240/240  mg multiple dose cohort, and 
6 (100.0%) patients who received placebo. One (16.7%) patient in the 480 mg CD24F c 
single dose cohort experienced hyperglycemia that was considered a study drug -related 
Grade 3/4/5 TEAE.  
No patients receiving CD24Fc experienced a DLT during the study.   One dose- limiting 
toxicity (DLT) was observed in the placebo group  
In total, 1 (4.2%) patient died during the study. Patient  received placebo and experienced Grade 4 pneumomediastinum and Grade 5 pneumonia TEAEs that resulted in death. Per the Investigator, it was considered unlikely that these TEAEs were related to study drug.  
 
Treatment Emergent SAEs (TESAEs)  
In total, 9 (37.5%) patients experienced TESAEs from Day -1 to 30/60 days after the last 
dosing: 2 (33.3%) patients in the 240  mg CD24Fc single dose cohort (30 days), 
1 (16.7%)  patient in the 480 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort (30 days),  4 (66.7%)  patients 
in the 480/240/240  mg CD24Fc multiple dose cohort  (60 days), and 
2 (33.3%)  patients  who received placebo (30, 30, 60 days). Treatment -emergent SAEs 
reported for patients who received CD24Fc  (some patients had more than one condition) 
were  nausea  (2), stomatiti s (1), abdominal pain (1), dehydration(1) , decreased appetite  
(1), device related infection (1), pain (1), weight decreased (1), arthritis  (1), cognitive 
disorder  (1), and embolism  (1). No  patients  experienced a study drug -related treatment -
emergent SAE.  
In total, 1 patient experienced a TEAE that led to discontinuation of study drug: this patient  
received placebo. Patient  experienced a Grade 4 pneumonia TEAE that led to 
discontinuation of study drug (ie, placebo). Per the Investigator, it was considered unlikely that this TEAE was related to study drug.  
In Chemistry laboratory tests, the incidence of TEAEs of alanine aminotransferase increased or blood alkaline phosphatase increased were similar between patients who received CD24Fc and patients who received placebo (ALT: 44% vs 50%; ALP 22% vs  
17%).  The incidence of TEAEs of aspartate aminotransferase increased was higher for 
patients who received CD24Fc compared to patients who received placebo  (28% vs 
18%) . TEAEs  of blood cholesterol increased were only reported by patients in the 
480/240/240 mg CD24Fc multiple dose cohort ( 11%). Treatment -emergent adverse 
events of blood creatinine increased were only reported by patients who received placebo (33.3%). A TEAE of blood bilirubin increased was reported by 1 (16.7%) patient who received placebo.  In general, TEAEs were consistent with toxicities normally associated 
with HCT conditioning and did not appear associated with investigational therapy or placebo.

TEAEs of platelet count decreased was similar between patients who received CD24Fc and patients who received placebo (94% vs 83%) . 
No patient had a laboratory abnormality that was considered an SAE or resulted in discontinuation of study drug.  
No patients who received either single or multiple dosing of CD24Fc had positive ADA results at any time point sampled pre- or post -infusion.  
 A TEAE of weight increased was reported by 1 (16.7%) patient who received placebo

In total, 18 (100.0%) patients who received CD24Fc and 5 (83.3%) patients who received placebo experienced platelet engraftment. The median time to platelet engra ftment was 
15.5 days for patients in the 240 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort, 13.0 days for patients in the 480 mg CD24Fc single dose cohort, 12.0 days for patients in 480/240/240 mg 
CD24Fc multiple dose cohort, and 15.0 days for patients who received placebo. No 
patients experienced primary engraftment failure.  
The mean CD3 cell chimerism on Day 28/Day 30 was 73.0% donor cells for patients who received CD24Fc and 77.4% donor cells for patients who received placebo. The mean CD3 cell chimerism on Day 100 was 80.9% donor cells for patients who received CD24Fc and 73.8% donor cells for patients who received placebo.  
The mean CD33 cell chimerism on Day 28/Day 30 was 100.0% donor cells for patients who received CD24Fc and 100.0% donor cells for patients who received placebo. The mean CD33 cell chimerism on Day 100 was 99.4% donor cells for patients who received CD24Fc and 96.6% donor cells for patients who received placebo.

 11.1. 9 PHARMACOKINETICS IN HUMANS  
 
11.1.9 .1 PHASE I PK  
 
The PK of CD24Fc in healthy human subjects was  determined from the single dose Phase 
1 study. The mean plasma concentration of CD24Fc increased proportionally to the dose 
of CD24Fc administered (Figure 9). For all dose groups except 120 mg, the maximum 
mean plasma concentration of CD24Fc was reached at 1 hour post -dose. The maximum 
mean plasma concentration of CD24Fc for the 120 mg group was reached at 2 hours post-dose. By Day 42 (984 hours), the mean plasma concentration of CD24Fc for all 
groups had decreased to between 2% and 4% of the m aximum mean plasma 
concentration.  The plasma CD24Fc reached Tmax at 1.34 hours. The t½ of  plasma 
CD24Fc range was 280.83 to 327.10 hours.

11.1.9 .2   Phase IIa PK  
The PK of CD24Fc in human subjects undergoing HCT has been determined from the 
Phase IIa study from the two single dose cohorts and one multi -dose cohort. With the 240 
mg single dose, the mean plasma concentration of CD24Fc is similar to the 120 mg single

 dose in Phase I human volunteers. The 480 mg dose shows a proportional increase of 
CD24Fc at all time points (Figure 10, upper panel). The 480/240/240 mg multi -dose 
maintains the CD24Fc plasma concentration over 10,000 ng/ml over the period of Day -1 
to Day 42 post -HCT (Figure  10, lower panel).  
 
Following a single IV administration of CD24Fc (240 and 480 mg CD24Fc single dose 
cohorts), the geometric mean plasma exposure (C max, -1d, AUC 0-42d, and AUC 0-inf) 
increased with increasing CD24Fc doses. The mean t ½ and λ z were similar between the 
240 and 480 mg doses of CD24Fc. The mean values of t ½ were 414.739 and 406.648 h 
and the mean values of λ z were 0.0018 and 0.0017 h-1 for the 240 and 480 mg CD24Fc 
single dose cohorts, respectively. Additionally, there was an increase in the mean V z and 
CL between the 240 and 480 mg doses of CD24Fc.  
Following multiple IV administrations of CD24Fc ( 480/240/240 mg CD24Fc multi-d ose 
cohort), the exposure of CD24Fc was sustained over time. Additionally, the mean plasma CD24Fc concentration on Day 100 was higher for the 480/240/240  mg CD24Fc multi-
dose cohort (850.84 ng/mL) compared to the single dose cohorts (216.38 ng/mL and 330.96 ng/mL for the 240 and 480 mg CD24Fc single dose cohorts, respectively). 
Furthermore, the geometric mean AUC
0-last,overall  value was higher for the 480/240/240  mg 
CD24Fc multi- dose cohort (37,363,953.5 ng ⋅h/mL) compared to the single dose cohorts 
(10,156,549.9 ng⋅h/mL and 15,522,686.2 ng ⋅h/mL for the 240 and 480 mg CD24Fc single 
dose cohorts, respectively).  
The median t max, -1d (2.10 h for both the 240 and 480 mg CD24Fc single dose cohorts and 
2.13 h for the 480/240/240 mg CD24Fc multiple dose cohort) remai ned consistent across 
all of the CD24Fc doses. For the 480/240/240 mg CD24Fc cohort, the median t max, -1d and 
tmax,28d  were similar (2.13 and 2.52 h, respectively).

 11.1.10  IMMUNOGENICITY IN HUMANS  
11.1.10 .1 PHASE 1 ADA  
 
Serum samples in the Phase I study were screened for anti -drug antibodies. Anti-CD24Fc 
antibodies were detectable at Day 28 and Day 42 in 1 subject in each of the 5 dose cohorts; however, for the subject in the CD24Fc 120 mg group and the subject in the CD24Fc 240 mg group, anti -CD24Fc antibodies were also detectable pre- dose at levels 
higher than post -dose levels. Except for those subjects with significant pre- dose anti -
CD24Fc antibody levels, all post -dose anti -CD24Fc antibody levels were modest. No 
deviations in PK were found in any subjects with detectable anti -CD24Fc antibody levels.    
 
11.1.10 .2. PHASE IIA ADA  
In the Phase IIa allogeneic HCT context, given the immunoablation and 
immunosuppression of host immunity at time of CD24Fc administration, ADA r esponses 
were monitored but unlikely to be elicited.  
 For the two single dose cohorts, the samples were collected at 7 time points  from Day -1 
to Day 100. For the multi -dose cohort, the samples were collected at 13 time points  from 
Day-1 to Day 100. As expected, all samples are negative for ADA in the Phase IIa study.  
 
  
11.2 PLACEBO  
 
The placebo will consist of 100 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride  for dose levels -1, 0, 1 and 2 
and will be administrated by intravenous infusion over a minimum of 60 minutes . The 
placebo will consist of 200 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for dose level 3 and will be 
administrated by intravenous infusion over a minimum of 120 minutes .  
 CD24Fc is supplied as a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative- free aqueous, solution and 
thus is indistinguishable from placebo (saline). Since CD24Fc has not been associated 
with infusion reactions and is a clear, colorless liquid, saline should be an effective placebo.  
 The study drug (CD24Fc  or placebo) will be labeled anonymously in order to maintain the 
study blind.  
 The Phase IIa expansion cohort is open label and will not utilize placebo.

 11.3 METHOTREXATE  
11.3.1  FORMULATION  
Chemically methotrexate is N - [4 - [(2, 4 – diamino – 6 – pteridinyl) methyl] 
methylaminolbenzoyl] – L - glutamic acid. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite used in the 
treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, severe psoriasis, adult rheumatoid arthritis, and 
prevention of acute GVHD. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one- carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and 
thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication.  
11.3.2
 AVAILABILITY AND ADMIN ISTRATION  
Methotrexate sodium for injection is available in 25  mg/ml solution. The appropriate 
amount is drawn into a syringe for administration.   Store at controlled room temperature, 
20°-25° C (68° -77° F); excursions permitted to 15° -30° C (59° -86° F). Protect from light.  
11.3.3  POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with methotrexate use as GVHD prophylaxis include ulcerative stomatitis, leucopenia and suppressed hematopoiesis, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other frequently reported adverse effects are malaise, undue fatigue, chills and fever, dizziness and decreased resistance to infection. Methotrexate may be associated with increased rates of pulmonary complications after transplantation. The risk of infections is due to the suppression of hematopoiesis after transplantation.  
11.3.4
 POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS  
Methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin, and toxicity may be increased because of displacement by certain drugs, such as salicylates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and sulfonamides. Renal tubular transport is also diminished by probenecid; use of methotrexate with this drug should be carefully monitored. Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and nonabsorbable broad- spectrum antibiotics, may 
decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora and suppressing metabolism of the drug by bacteria. Penicillins may reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate; increased serum concentrations of methotrexate with concomitant hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity have been observed with high and low dose methotrexate. Use of methotrexate with penicillins should be carefully monitored.  
  
11.4 TACROLIMUS  (PROGRAF, FK506)  
11.4.1
 FORMULATION  
Tacrolimus, previously known as FK506, is the active ingredient in Prograf. Tacrolimus is 
a macrolide immunosuppressant produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus 
appears as white crystals or crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in water, freely

 soluble in ethanol, and very soluble in methanol and chloroform. Tacrolimus inhibits T -
lymphocyte activation, although the exact mechanism of action is not known. 
Experimental evidence suggests that tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP -
12. A complex of tacrolimus -FKBP- 12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then 
formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin inhibited. This effect may prevent the generation of nuclear factor of activated T -cells (NF -AT), a nuclear component thought to 
initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines (interleukin- 2, gamma 
interferon). The net result is the inhibition of T -lymphocyte activation (i.e., 
immunosuppression).  
11.4.2
 AVAILABILITY AND ADMI NISTRATION  
Prograf is available for oral administration as capsules (tacrolimus capsules) containing the equivalent of 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 5 mg of anhydrous tacrolimus. Inactive ingredients include lactose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium,  and magnesium 
stearate. The 1- mg capsule shell contains gelatin and titanium dioxide, and the 0.5 mg 
and 5- mg capsules shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide and ferric oxide. Prograf is also 
available as a sterile solution (tacrolimus injection) containing the equivalent of 5 mg anhydrous tacrolimus in 1 mL for administration by intravenous infusion only. Each mL contains polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil (HCO -60), 200 mg, and dehydrated alcohol, 
USP, 80.0% v/v. Prograf injection must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 
5% dextrose injection before use. Intravenous administration will be given by continuous 
infusion. Oral preparation will be administered on empty stomach every 12 hours.  
11.4.3
 POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS  
a. Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma may result from immunosuppression.  
b. Nephrotoxicity has been noted in 40% and 33% of liver transplantation patients receiving Prograf in the U.S. and European randomized trials, respectively. The  risk 
appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. A lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) related to Epstein - 
Barr virus (EBV) infection has been reported in immunosuppressed organ tr ansplant 
recipients. The risk of LPD appears greatest in young children who are at risk for primary EBV infection while immunosuppressed or who are switched to Prograf following long -
term immunosuppression therapy.  
c. Mild to severe hyperkalemia has been noted in 44% and 10% of liver transplant recipients treated with Prograf in the U.S. and European randomized trials and may require treatment.  
d. Neurotoxicity, including tremor, headache, and other changes in motor function, mental status, and sensory function were reported in approximately 55% of liver transplant recipients in the two randomized studies. Tremor and headache have been associated with high whole- blood concentrations of tacrolimus and may respond to dosage 
adjustment. Seizures have occurred in adult and pediatric patients receiving Prograf.

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 Coma and delirium also have been associated with high plasma concentrations of 
tacrolimus.  
e. Hypertension is a common adverse effect of Prograf therapy. Mild or moderate hypertension is more frequently reported than severe hypertension. Antihypertensive 
therapy may be required; the control of blood pressure can be accomplished with any of the common antihypertensive agents. Since tacrolimus can cause hyperkalemia, potassium -sparing diuretics should be av oided. While calcium -channel blocking agents 
can be effective in treating Prograf -associated hypertension, care should be taken since 
interference with tacrolimus metabolism may require a dosage reduction.  
f. Hyperglycemia was associated with the use of Prograf in 47% and 29% of liver transplant recipients in the U.S. and European randomized studies, respectively and may require treatment.  
 
11.5 CYCLOSPORINE (SANDIMMUNE, NEORAL)  
 
NOTE: Per protocol Cyclosporine will only be administered as a second line agent in 
cases where tacrolimus is no longer indicated due to intolerance (i.e. CNS toxicity).  
Cyclosporine is a cyclic polypeptide immunosuppressant agent produced by the fungus  
species Beauveria nivea. While the molecular structure of cyclosporine is dis tinct from 
tacrolimus, their mechanism of action is almost indistinguishable and involves inhibition of calcineurin and the resulting activation cascade leads to inhibition of T cell signaling. 
Cyclophilin is the cytosolic binding protein for cyclosporine that is distinct from FK binding 
protein. Refer to the FDA -approved package insert for more information  
 
11.5.1
 ORAL OR INTRAVENOUS AVAILABILITY  
 
a. Cyclosporine is most commonly prescribed as soft gelatin capsules (neoral) or modified 
oral solution (Neoral Oral Solution) that have increased bioavailability in comparison to the less commonly used Sandimmune formulations. Neoral and Sandimmune cannot be 
used interchangeably and care must be exercised when converting from high doses of 
Sandimmune to Neoral . Neoral capsules are available in two strengths: 25 mg (oval, blue-
gray) or 100 mg (oblong, blue- gray) imprinted in red. Neoral Oral solution is available in 
50 mL bottles of yellow liquid containing 100 mg/mL of cyclosporine. Both neural 
formulations contain 11.9% v/v alcohol. Sandimmune capsules are available in two 
strengths:  25 mg (oblong, pink) or 100 mg (oblong, dusty rose), in unit dose packages of 
30 capsules that should be stored at 25°C (77°F). Sandimmune Oral solution is available in 50 mL bo ttles of yellow liquid containing 100 mg/mL of cyclosporine. Both Sandimmune 
formulations contain ~12.5% v/v alcohol.  
 b. Sandimm une IV solution is supplied in 5 mL ampoules that contain 50 mg of 
cyclosporine per mL, Cremaphor and 32.9% alcohol v/v.

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
  
c. Neoral or Sandimmune is available through the hospital pharmacy during all inpatient  
admissions and through the local pharmacy for outpatient management.  
 
11.5.2 STORAGE AND HANDLING  
 
Sandimmune should be stored in the original container below 25°C (77°F).  Neural 
capsules and oral solution should be stored at 20°C -25°C (68°F -77°F) and not in the 
refrigerator. Sandimmune intravenous solution should be stored at temperatures below 30°C (86°F) but not in the refrigerator and should be protected from light.  
 Oral or Intravenous Administration  
 a. Do not administer liquid from plastic or Styrofoam cup. May dilute Neoral oral solution 
with orange juice or apple juice. May dilut e Sandimmune oral solution with milk, chocolate 
milk, or orange juice. Avoid changing  diluents frequently. Mix thoroughly and drink at 
once. Use syringe provided to measure dose. Mix in a glass container  and rinse container 
with more diluent to ens ure total dose is taken. Do not rinse syringe before or after use 
(may cause dose variation).  
 b. Intravenous  administration will be given by continuous infusion. Discard solution after 
24 hours. Anaphylaxis has been reported with intravenous use; reserve for patients who 
cannot take oral form. Patients should be under continuous observation for at least the 
first 30 minutes of the infusion, and should be monitored frequently thereafter. Maintain 
patient airway; other supportive m easures and agents for treating anaphylaxis should be 
present when intravenous drug is giv en. 
 
11.5.3
 POTENTIAL DRUG INTERA CTIONS  
 
Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) system. Drugs that may increase cyclosporine blood concentrations include: calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antifungal agents (e.g., 
ketoconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, pozaconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin,  erythromycin, troleandomycin), gastrointestinal 
prokinetic agents (e.g., cisapride, meto clopramide), and/or other drugs (e.g., 
bromocriptine, cimetidine, tacrolimus, danazol,  ethinyl estradiol, omeprazole, 
nefaz odone, HIV -protease inhibitors. Drugs  that may decrease cyclosporine 
concentrations include: anticonvulsants (e.g.,  carbamazepine, phen obarbital, phenytoin), 
antibiotics (e.g., rifabutin, rifapentine), and/or herbal preparations (e.g., St. John’s Wort 
[hypericum perforatum]). Refer to http://medicine.iupu.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx for 
current information about drug drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors.

 11.5.4  EXCRETION  
 
The absorption of cyclosporine after oral administration is incompletely dependent on the 
individual patient, patient population and the formulation. Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent in the gastrointes tinal tract and kidney. At 
least 25 metabolites have been identified in bile, feces, blood and urine but the parent 
compound is primarily responsible for the immunosuppr essive activity. Elimination is 
primarily biliary with only 6% of the dose excreted in urine. The mean terminal elimination 
half-life (T1/2) of cyclosporine is 8.4 hours (range 5- 18 hours). Th e mean T1/2 was 
reduced by 2- 3 fold in patients with impaired hepati c function. Dosage reduction is 
recommended for pat ients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  
 
12.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AN D REPORTING CRITERIA  
12.1 DEFINITION OF A DVERSE EVENTS  
 
Adverse Event (AE): An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
investigation subject  administered a pharmaceutical product  regardless of causality 
assessment. An adverse event can be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or disease temporarily associated with 
or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether or not considered related to the investigational product. As such, the AEs will be continuously followed and reported after the study subjects have been started on the investigational drug  and recorded on 
the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) . 
 Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the Investigator  and recorded on the eCRF.  
However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the Investigator , it should be recorded as a separate 
adverse event on the eCRF.  Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
 Any medical condition already present at screening should not be reported as an adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity or seriousness at any time during the study.  In this case, it should be reported as an adverse event.  
 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g. electrocardiogram) findings that are detected during th e study or are present at screening and significantly 
worsen during the study should be reported as AEs.  The Investigator  will exercise his or 
her medical or scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormal

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests 
return normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  Any abnormal test that is determine d to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.           
 These events may be:  
 
• Definitely related: clearly associated with study drug/treatment  
• Probably related: likely associated with study drug/treatment  
• Possibly related: may be associated with study drug or other treatment  
• Unlikely to be related, or  
• Definitely not related to the study drug/treatment  
 
For reporting purposes, an AE should be regarded as definitely or probably related to the 
study drug if the Investigator  believes that at least one of following criteria are met:  
• There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and the administration of the study drug or treatment.  
• There is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study drug or treatment causing or contributing to the AE.  
• The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or procedures.  
• A potential alternative cause does not exist.  
 Serious Adverse Experience (SAE):  Any adverse drug experience occurring at any 
dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life -threatening adverse drug experience,  
Note: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered ‘life- threatening’ if, in 
view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at 
immediate risk of death.  It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
Note: Any hospital admission that is >24 hours is  considered an inpatient 
hospitalization.  An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as an SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as AEs and assessed for seriousness.  Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons (e.g. no place to stay, live too far  away 
to come for hospital visits) will not be considered inpatient hospitalizations.   
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or  require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Expected Event : - An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if:  
• For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events are described 
in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
• For investigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
• In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.  See sect ion 3.7 for the 
list of expected adverse events related to the drug under study.  
 
• Unexpected adverse events: - An adverse event (AE) is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not described in the Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical lite rature, in the protocol, or in the informed consent 
document.  
 
12.2 DEFINITION OF A E SEVERITY  
 
The severity or grade of an adverse event may be measured using the following definitions:  
 Event grading:  The NCI Common Terminology Criteria ( CTCAE Version 4.0) will be used 
to grade intensity of adverse events and assist in reporting adverse events.  
 Mild:  Noticeable to the subject, but does not interfere with the subject’s expected daily 
activities, usually does not require additional therapy or intervention, dose reduction, or discontinuation of the study. In the transplant setting CTCAE version 4 .0 grade s 1 and 2.  
 Moderate:  Interferes with the subject’s expected daily activities, may require some

 12.3.1  AE REPORTING  
 
Reporting of AEs and SAEs will occur  directly to the Multi -Site study coordinator, 
which will be disseminated to the S ponsor,  CRO,  PI, IRB, FDA and other regulatory 
bodies, as appropriate.  
 
In order to maintain the safety of subjects, the following study specific AE / SAE reporting plan has been devised.  
 Reporting to Sponsor/CRO:  
 
• All AEs (regardless of grade and attribution) will be recorded in the patient’s source and entered into the electronic data capture system from the time of CD24Fc infusion through day 30 post HCT  for single dose cohorts and through day 60 post 
HCT for the multi -dosing  and expansion cohort s (the treatment period).   Any AE 
that is reported after the treatment period has ended and is considered related to treatment (possibly, probably, definitely ) should also be entered in the electronic 
data capture system.  
 Expedited Reporting (the following need to be added into t he electronic data 
capture system and reported to the Sponsor/CRO within 24 hours of knowledge) : 
• All AEs (regardless of grade) from time of CD24Fc infusion through 24 hours after CD24Fc infusion including subjects receiving blinded placebo.  
 
• A ll grade 3- 5 AEs (except as indicated in Section 12.3.2) occurring a fter the 24 
hour post CD24Fc infusion period has elapsed on day 0 through the treatment 
period  will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  and CRO . Note: this duration 
allows for over two half -lives o f CD24Fc to elapse (t
1/2 is 11 -14 days).   
 
• Events resulting in death during the treatment period.  
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB  
The Investigator must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the 
report of SAEs to their Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB must be informed in a 
timely manner by the Investigator, or their designee, of SAEs occurring at their study 
site during the study, as required. The Investigator must also submit safety reports provided by the Sponsor to their I RB. 
 
Reporting of SAES to the FDA  
 
In accordance with FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE 
EVENTS (21 CFR Part  312): In this trial, serious, unexpected adverse events believed to

 be definitely, probably or possibly related to the study treatment will be reported to the 
FDA.    
  SAE Reporting- Procedures for Investigators  
Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of CD24Fc infusion up to and including 30 days  post 
HCT for the single -dosing cohorts or 60 days post HCT for the multi -dosing  and expansion  
cohort s must be reported to the Principal Investigator and Coordinating Center within 24 
hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any adverse event that meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria).  All SAEs that the investigator considers related to study drug occurring after 30 days post HCT  for the single -dosing cohorts or 60 
days post HCT for the multi -dosing  and expansion cohort s must be reported to the 
Principal Investigator and Coordinating Center  
 Events should be reported using the Coordinating Center’s SAE form as available in the 
study database. A copy of SAE form should be sent to the Coordinating Center via email 
to  within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of 
the ev
ent.  
Contact information for Principal Investigator SAE Reporting:  
Name: 
John Magenau, MD  
Email:  
 
The C
oordinating Center /CRO will disseminate information regarding SAEs to the 
participating sites within 5 days of review of the information by the Coordinating Center’s 
Principal Investigator (or designee in the event of extended absence) only in the case that the event(s) is believed to be unexpected and related (i.e., possibly, probably, or definitely) to the study drug.  
The investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) or the subject dies.  Follow -up information must also be reported within 24 hours of receipt 
of the information by the Investigator.  
The Coordinating Center will be responsible for reporting of events to the  Sponsor and 
CRO, as outlined below :

Coordinating Center to the Sponsor, CRO and FDA in an expedited manner are listed in section 12.3. 2 below.  
 
12.3.2
 EVENTS NOT REPORTED : 
 
The following events will not be reported to th e Sponsor , CRO, IRB or FDA in an 
expedited manner  because they are anticipated to occur in the study population 
independent of study drug exposure.  
 
Anticipated events include hematologic AEs (i.e. anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, 
neutropenia), infections, electrolyte abnormalities, and some organ toxicities  if they can 
be directly related to components of the HCT procedure (e.g. conditioning regimen, immunosuppressant medications, blood transfusion reactions) . Events directly related to 
progression of the underlying malignancy or condition under investigation (e.g. acute GVHD) will not require expedited reporting. NOTE: see section 17.5 for formal stopping rules for excessive GVHD.  
 Given the frequency with which these occur in transplant patients, we will  record but not 
report events that  typically occur during the pre and post -transplant related therapy unless 
they otherwise meet the criteria for reporting as detailed above and below. An event is regarded as typical if it is specified in BMT Program transplant consent and / or it occurs 
in more than 5% of transplant patients.  
  
12.3.3
 EVENTS REPORTED AS ADVERSE EVENTS ROUTINELY IN TABULAR FORMAT : 
 
In addition to the reporting guidelines above, all serious adverse events will be reported to the  University of Michigan  Rogel  Cancer Center DSM C and Sponsor with each routine 
report ( monthly ) and in the annual IRB report .  
 Events not meeting criteria for SAE will also be recorded and compiled in tabular format, 
but will not be routinely reported to the DSM C, oversight bodies or Sponsor unless 
observed to be more frequent in nature or specifically requested.

 12.3.4  PREGNANCY REPORTING  
If the  subject participating in the study becomes pregnant during the study or within 30 
days of discontinuing study drug, the Investigator should report the pregnancy to the 
Principal Investigator and Coordinating Center  within 24 hours of being notified.  The 
Coordinating Center will be responsible for notifying the Sponsor and CRO within 24 
hours of knowledge.  
A subject becoming pregnant prior to administration of  study drug will immediately be 
withdrawn from the study and early termination study procedures will be performed.  
A subject becoming pregnant within the treatment period drug should be  followed by the 
investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the Principal Investigator and Coordinating  Center .  At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document 
the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow 
the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
13.0 DATA SAFETY MONIT ORING PLAN (DSMP)  
 
The following are the procedures for data and safety monitoring of this clinical trial to be 
coordinated by the University of Michigan  Blood and Marrow Transplant program and

been filed.  
 
13.2 STORA GE AND DISSEMINATION  OF REPORTS  
 
The multisite coordinator at the Coordinating Center  at the University of Michigan is 
responsible for collating all the Data and Safety Monitoring Reports  from all participating 
institutions  and providing this information to Data Safety Monitoring Committee . The 
Coordinating Center  will coordinate the reporting process between the Investigator s, the 
Sponsor , the IRB and University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center  DSM C as well as other 
applicable reporting agencies (FDA and study sponsors). Copies of all related correspondence and reporting documents will be maintained by the Coordinating Center  
and the research data file will be maintained in a file by the BMT data management team.  
 
13.3 CLINICAL MONITORING PROCEDURES  
 
Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good Clinical Practices and in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  The following measures have been taken to ensure the safe conduct of this 
clinical trial:  
 Monthly teleconferences will be conducted among  investigators from  participating study 
sites, the multisite coordinator from University of Michigan, the principal  investigator (PI) , 
study statistician  and medical monit or from the sponsor and / or its designee (i.e. CRO). 
At these meetings safety events, DLTs , withdrawals, subjects’ progress and other

 relevant events  on trial will be reviewed and appropriate actions  will be taken including 
amending or suspending the trial . Safety  report s generated by the Coordinating Center  
will also be submitted to the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee  (DSM C) and the medical monitor from the sponsor monthly . The 
DSM C and Sponsor will both be responsible for reviewing these reports  monthly  and if 
necessary taking appropriate steps to ensure the safety of subjects and compliance with 
this protocol  (i.e. inquiries, suspension, or termination of trial ).  
 
If the protocol advances to Phase IIa – expansion cohort the DSM C will review reports in 
a similar fashion on a monthly basis. Evidence of DSMC review will be provided to the 
study team  for submission to the University of Michigan IRBMED monthly during Phase 
IIa and Phase IIa – expansion c ohort . 
 Finally, w henever an unanticipated data, safety and monitoring board meeting takes place 
or when a new development occurs the medical monitor from the sponsor and / or its 
designee (i.e. CRO) and IRB will be notified of the occurrence.    
 This study will be  continuously  monitored by a Coordinating Center  representative of the 
University of Michigan  Rogel  Cancer Center  in addition to a clinical research organi zation  
(CRO) to be determined by the sponsor. Monitoring visits will be made during the conduct 
of the study and at study close- out. 
 Prior to subject recruitment, a site initiation meeting will be conducted by the Coordinating 
Center . The PI and the study staff should make every effort to attend the site initiation 
meeting. Study -related questions or issues identified during the site initiation meeting will 
be followed by the appropriate University of Michi gan Rogel  Cancer Center personnel 
until they have been answered and resolved.  
 The first monitoring visit at each site should occur after the first subject enrolled completes 
the Day 30 visit . At a minimum, a central and/or on -site monitoring visit will be done at 
least quarterly . The purpose is to verify:  
 a. Adherence to the protocol  
b. Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples c ollected  
c. Proper storage, dispensing, and inventory of study medication  
d. Compliance with regulations  
 Monitoring may be in the form of a site visit or a review of the documents at the Coordinating Center. During a monitoring  visit, access to relevant hospital and clinical 
records must be given by the PI to the Coordinating Center  representative conducting the 
monitoring visit to verify consistency of data collected on the CRFs with the original source data. While most patient cases will be selected from  patients accrued since the previous 
monitoring visit, any patient case has the potential for review. At least one or more

 unannounced cases will be reviewed, if the total accruals warrant selection of 
unannounced cases.  
 The Coordinati ng Center  expects the relevant investigational staff to be available to 
facilitate the conduct of the visit, that source documents are available at the time of the visit, and that a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related 
documents. Any issues identified during these visits will be communicated and are expected to be resolved in a time manner.  
 At close -out upon completion, termination, or cancellation of a study to ensure fulfillment 
of study obligations during the conduct of the study will occur, and the PI will be informed of his / her ongoing responsibilities. In general, close- out is conducted during a site visit. 
However, a site close- out can occur without a site visit .  
14.0 QUALITY ASSURAN CE AND AUDITS  
 The Quality Assurance Review Committee (QARC) of the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center  performs quality assurance audits of investigator -initiated clinical trials. 
Audits provide assurance that trials are conducted in compliance with the protocol.  
Further, they ensure that study data are collected, documented and reported in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) Guidelines and regulatory requirements. A QARC audit of each clinical trial is conducted annually. All audit findings are reported  
by QARC to the DSM C and the sponsor . The DSM C can also request QARC for a ‘for 
cause’ quality audit of the trial if the Committee  identifies a need for a more rigorous 
evaluation of study -related issues. A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to 
conduct an inspection of the study, during its conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory authority, the site investigator must immediately inform the Coordinating Center  that such a request has been made.  Audits 
of conduct of the clinical trial will also be conducted by the CRO to be determined by the sponsor . 
15.0 REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The PI also has the right to withdraw patients from the study in the event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, treatment failure, protocol violation, or other reasons. Should a patient (or a patient’s legally authorized guardian or representative) decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. A complete final evaluation should be made at the time of the patient’s withdrawal with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing and every effort should be made to perform follow -up evaluations. Patients may be removed from the study treatment if one or more 
of the following events occur:

 • Significant protocol violation or noncompliance, either on the part of the patient or 
the PI.  
• Refusal of the patient to continue treatment and / or observations.  
• Unacceptable or dose- limiting toxicity . 
• Decision by the PI that removal from the study is in the patient’s medical interest.  
• Unrelated medical illness or complication.  
• Lost to follow -up. 
• Disease relapse or progression.  
 
In single dose cohorts patients removed from the study prior to  receiv ing their  CD24Fc  
dose maybe replaced.  In the mult i-dose cohort subject s who receive < 2 dosages may be 
replaced.  Additionally, subject s who die of  causes that are unrelated to study drug  toxicity  
(i.e. documented  progression of underlying malignancy ) during the treatment period may 
be replaced.  The number of patients removed from the study prior to being fully evaluable 
will be monitored regularly by the study’s DSM C in order to identify and address pro blems 
that may develop with respect to patient accrual. We estimate that <10% of subjects may 
need to be replaced because they encounter  relapse / progression or  toxicity related to 
HCT conditioning therapy. Patients who are enrolled but are replaced will still be counted 
in an intention to treat analysis.  
16.0 OPERATIONS AS A M ULTI -CENTER STUDY  
 
16.1 MULTI -CENTER COORDINATION  
 
This is a multi- center Phase II  randomized, double blinded,  dose escalation study  
followed by  an open label dose expansion at the RP2D . The Uni versity of Michigan will 
be the coordinating center.  
 
16.2 SUBJECT SCREENING  AND REGISTRATION PROCEDURE  
 
Patient registration for this trial will be centrally managed by the Coordinating Center  of 
the University of Michigan Rogel  Cancer Center  as described below:  
 A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the  
Informed Consent document will be initially documented by the participating site on the  
Scree ning and Enrollment Log . It is the responsibility of the local site investigator to 
determine patient eligibility prior to submitting patient registration request to the 
Coordinating Center .  After patient  eligibility has been determined, a copy of the 
completed Eligibility Worksheet together  with all the pertinent de- identified source 
documents will be submitted by the requesting  site to the Coordinating Center , by email

the submitted documents and process the registration. Sites should inform the Multi -Site 
Coordinator of a potential registration by 5 p.m. on  the day prior to registration. Same day 
registrations cannot be guaranteed.  
An email will be sent by the registrar to the requesting site registrar to confirm patien t 
registration and to provide the study identification number that has been assigned to the 
patient. In addition, a copy of the completed Eligibility Worksheet signed and dated by the 
registrar, will be emailed back to the requesting site registrar. Patients found to be 
ineligible for participation after being consented will be considered screen failures, and 
documented as such in the Screening and Enrollment Log. These patients will not have 
study identification number assigned to them, and will not receive study treatment.

TISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
17.1 OVERVIEW  
As the Phase IIa part of the study has completed, the statistical considerations of this 
section will be focused on the Phase II open label single arm expansion and the registered 
control matching method.  
Given that there is sufficient evidence for safety in Phase IIa, the Phase II expansion 
study will enroll an additional 20 subjects in order to further evaluate the efficacy of the

 multi- dose regimen as RP2D. The primary objective is to determine whether the addition 
of CD24Fc to standard GVHD prophylaxis improves 180 day grade III -IV acute GVHD 
free survival  (AGFS) when compared to registered controls receiving standard GVHD 
prophylaxis.  
17.2. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY RESULTS FROM PHASE IIA STUDY 
 Placebo -Controlled Comparison  
The P hase IIa portion of the study was carried out in 24 patients with 3 dosing cohorts. 
The first cohort received a single dose of 240 mg CD24Fc at Day -1 (one day before 
transplantation). The second cohort received a single dose of 480 mg CD24Fc at Day -1. 
The third cohort received three doses of CD24Fc in a schedule of 480 mg at Day -1, 240 
mg at Day 14 and 240 mg at Day 28.  The patients were randomized into CD24Fc or placebo group at 3:1 ratio in a double blind fashion so that each dose level consisted of 6 patients receiving CD24Fc and 2 receiving placebo. Overall, a total of 18 patients 
received CD24Fc (combined dose levels) and 6 received placebo.  When the data from 
18 CD24Fc -treated patients were compared with the 6 placebo controls, the data 
demonstrat ed that CD24Fc provided a statistically significant improvement in severe 
acute GVHD -free ( AGRS) survival at day 180 post HCT.  
 These results are promising and suggest that CD24Fc, when added to methotrexate and tacrolimus prophylaxis, reduces the risk of  developing grade III and IV aGVHD in patients 
undergoing HCT after receiving myeloablative conditioning.  However, due to the small sample size, it is not possible to rule out potential baseline imbalances that might explain the improved outcome for CD24F c-treated patients. To address this concern, 
OncoImmune intends to collect additional clinical data to confirm the apparent treatment effect.

CD24Fc for GVHD Prevention;  v4.2:  March 07, 2019  
 Clinical outcomes of the 18 CD24Fc -treated patients in the Phase IIa study were 
compared with data from a cohort of 92 consecutive transplant cases admitted at two of 
the study sites over the same period of time.  The controls were chosen based on the following pre- specified criteria:  
 a. Myeloablative conditioning  
b. Patients having leukemia indicated for HCT  
c. HCT performed using 8/8 matched unrelated donor bone marrow or peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells.  
d. Age between 18- 70 years old.  
e. Transplantation were performed between 2012 and 2017.  
f. The GVHD prophylaxis is Tac/MTX.  
 Data from 92 consecutive patients that met these inclusion criteria were included for comparison.   
 Results of this analysis showed a significantly improvement of 180 day severe aGVHD -
free survival  (see section 3.8.2 ).  In addition, further f ollow up since data lock showed an 
encouraging trend for better 18- month relapse free survival and overall survival in patients 
treated with CD24Fc as compared to the cohort of contemporary controls.  
 These data are encouraging as they suggest that better outcomes in CD24Fc -treated 
HCT patients.  However, OncoImmune recognizes two key limitations of this comparison: (1) the disease and disease status were not included in selection criteria for the controls, 
and (2) a number of baseline factors were missing for the 92 patients, such as disease 
risk group, KPS score, HCT -CI score and the CMV status.  As a result, it is not possible 
to ensure baseline comparability on factors known to affect clinical outcomes.  We have requested matched historical control sampl es from CIBMTR using pre -specified criteria 
to ensure baseline compatibility.  
 To further address these limitations and provide more evidence that CD24Fc has a significant impact on 180 day severe GVHD -free survival following HCT, the sponsor 
proposes to: (1) conduct a cohort -expansion study of  20 additional patients to evaluate 
CD24Fc at the multi -dose regimen (480-240-240 mg administered on days  -1, +14, and 
+ 28 days of HCT).  These data will be combined with the 6 patients previously treated at this dose level in Phase IIa (total 26 patients)  and (2) match these treated patients to 
historical controls obtained from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR).   
 Data from this new cohort of cases and matched historical control comparisons are expected to support findings from the previous Phase IIa study and fully justify breakthrough therapy designation for CD24Fc.

 17.3 PHASE II COHORT E XPANSION (PLANNED)  
 
An additional 20 patients will be enrolled in this  prospective single- arm, open -label Phase 
II cohort expansion study of CD24Fc for the prevention of acute GVHD following 
myeloablative allogeneic HCT.  Clinical outcomes in this patient cohort will be compared to clinical outcomes of matched historical controls extracted from an international transplant reg istry.  
 After interim analysis of data from phase IIa, a  discussion between the sponsor and study 
investigators was held to determine the RP2D. The 480/240/24/0 mg multi- dose was 
selected based on combination of factors including no discernable difference  in toxicity 
between single dose or placebo, apparent lowering of mucositis and optimal PK data. 
 This case -matched control comparison will focus on several measures of clinical 
outcome, including: time to first onset of grade III -IV acute GVHD or death within 180 
days, time to first onset of grade II -IV acute GVHD or death within 180 days, overall 
survival, time to disease progression, and treatment -related mortality. Individuals with 
unobserved event times will be censored at the time of last follow -up. The primary goal is 
to develop a more robust efficacy database and confirm the RP2 D. 
 
17.4. MATCHING CRITERI A FOR  PLANNED MATCHED HISTORICAL CONTROLS  
COHORT
 
 
Individual subjects in the cohort receiving multi -dose CD24Fc (including the 6 multi -dose 
cases from Phase IIa) will be matched 1: 4 with controls in the CIBMT registry based on 
a set of prognostic factors  known to potentially influence GVHD or survival after HCT . 
Each of the 26 cases will be paired with up to 4 control subjects (all available controls in the registry that satisfy matching criteria), thus avoiding the need to select controls using a model -based covariate score.   
 Directly matching covariate values of each treated patient with all available registry controls having identical  values will ensure comparability of case/control groups and 
provide a reliable test of the treatment effect, without imposing model assumptions or matching algorithms to select the control subjects.   
 The following prognostic variables will be used for m atching:  
 
1. Age (within 5 years);  
2. Gender;  
3. Performance score ( KPS ≥90 vs. <90);  
4. HCT -CI (≥3  vs. <3);  
5. Myeloablative conditioning regimen (Flu/Bu4 or Cy/TBI);  
6. 8/8 matched unrelated donor;

8. Disease status;   
9. Disease risk group;  
10. Stem cell source (BM or PBSCT)  
11. TAC/MTX as GVHD prophylaxis method.  
 
Up to four matches per case will be selected whenever possible; when more controls 
are available, preference will be given to controls who are closest in age to the patient. 
The follow up for control patients will be administratively censored at the time corresponding to the longest follow up of the trial patients.   
 
17.5 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTI FICATION  
 
The Phase IIa dose escalation portion of the study enrolled 24 patients (18 CD24Fc , 6 
placebo). An additional 20 patients will participate in the  Phase II cohort expansion 
portion of the trial, yielding a total of 38 patients exposed to the active product  for safety 
analysis .  Data from all 26 patients treated with the multi -dose CD24Fc regimen (20 
patients in the expansion cohort plus 6 patients from Phase IIa) will be used for the 
primary efficacy analysis.  A sensitivity analysis will also be performed for the 20- patient 
expansion cohort.  
The sample si ze for the expansion cohort was derived on the basis of feasibility as well 
as clinical and statistical considerations. A total of 20 patients matched with 80 historical controls from the CIBMTR will provide approximately 80% power to detect a hazard 
ratio of 5.0 (corresponding to an improvement in the 180 day GFS -free survival rate 
from 0.75 to 0.945), using a 2-sided logrank test at the 5% significance level.  This 
calculation assumes proportional hazards and an event rate of 1/18, or 0.055 in the 
CD24Fc -treated patients (as observed in Phase IIa study). The event rate in the control 
is conservatively projected at 75%, even though it was 50% is placebo control and <60% in contemporary controls.    
17.6. DATA ANALYSIS ME THODS  
Endpoints will be defined as fol lows:  
 
Primary endpoint:  
AGFS: Time from transplant to the earliest of aGVHD (Grade III -IV), death, or the last 
day of GVHD evaluation at 180+/ -4 days.  
 
Secondary endpoints:  
(1) Overall Survival (OS): Time from transplant to the earlier of death or last follow -up; 
(2) Disease Progression-F ree Survival (DFS): Time from transplant to the earliest of 
progression/ relapse, death, or last follow -up.

 (3) aGVHD (Grade II- IV)-free Survival (GFS): Time from transplant to occ urrence of 
aGVHD (Grade II- IV) or death or last follow up at 180+/ -4 days, whichever comes 
first;   
 
The probabilities of AGFS, OS, GFS and DFS will be calculated using the Kaplan- Meier 
estimator. Outcomes will be compared between groups using a stratified two- sided log -
rank test. Stratified Cox or Fine- Gray r egression will be used to obtain hazard ratios with 
95% confidence intervals.  
 
To account for multiple significance testing, the secondary endpoints will be evaluated 
using Hochberg’s procedure to control the overall Type 1 error rate at 0.05.  
 
Specific details will be provided in the full statistical analysis plan for the study.  
 
 
17.7 PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM)  
 
For the analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, individual subjects in the cohort receiving experiment treatment will be matched 1:4 with registry controls in the CIBMT R registry based on a set of known prognostic factors.  The 6 subjects in multi -dose 
cohort with CD24Fc treatment in Phase IIa will be combined with 20 subjects in Phase II expansion study to make a total of 26 cases. It is expected that approximately 104 
registered controls will be selected from CIBMTR database.  Note that propensity scores 
may be potentially limited  in this setting because of the small number of CD24Fc- treated 
cases and the large size of the registry database, which allows an exact match on the full set of covariates.      
 To adjust for  any potential biases due to i mbalances in pretreatment factors between  
the case and control groups, a logistic regression model will be used to determine the 
vector of pretreatment characteristics that best discriminates between the treated and 
control populations.  The following 7 independent pretreatment  factors  will be included in 
the binary logistic regression model for calculation of propensity score: age, r emission 
status, diagnosis, cytogenetic risk group (adverse- risk versus favorable/intermediate),  
donor type, HCT -CI, and period effect. Then each case will be matched  and paired to 
another patient from the registry control  group with the smallest differences in propensity 
score.    Following the advice of Rosenbaum and Rubin [68], the log of the odds of the probability 
of exposure will be used as a basis for matching. This is preferred to the propensity score itself because it is a linear function of the baseline variables (or of transformations of the baseline variables if the association between the variable and the log -odds of exposure 
is found to be nonlinear) and generally follows a reasonably normal distribution. Matching will be base d on the magnitude of the difference, not the direction. A narrow caliper

 (maximum permitted difference between matched subjects) will be used to improve 
performance of propensity score matching. To ensure that all treated subjects have at least one matched control, controls will be selected in order of the best available matches (in descending order), without increasing or decreasing the propensity score.  
  Stated formally, the propensity score e(x) is the conditional probability of belonging to the treatm ent group given the observed pretreatment variables, x, denoted as  
 e(x) = Pr(z = 1|x),  
 where z = 1 for subjects in the treatment group and z = 0 for the registry control subjects . 
 Covariate balance between the case and control subjects will be checked by (a) 
regressing each covariate and the logit of the propensity score on the treatment assignment, controlling for S -1 dummy indicators for the S propensity strata and their 
interactions with treatment assignment, and (b) conducting 2 × S (Conditions × St rata) 
ANOVAs, using both the propensity score and each predictor individually as dependent variables. Rosenbaum and Rubin [68] present three criteria for assessing the adequacy 
of the regression adjustment: (a) the difference in the means of the propensity  scores in 
the groups being compared must be small, (b) the ratio of the variances of the propensity score in the treatment and comparison groups must be close to one, and (c) the ratio of the variances of the residuals of the covariates after adjusting for the propensity scores must be close to one.

 APPENDIX D: PHASE II  EXPANSION STUDY SAM PLE SIZE CALCULATION S 
 
Assuming a 4:1 matching ratio, the proportion of subjects in Group 1 (the CD24Fc -treated 
group) will be 0.20 (q1) and the proportion of subjects in Group 0 (control group) will be 0.80 (q0).  Setting power = 0.80 (1- beta) and a two- sided significance level of 0.05 (alpha), 
the required number of events to detect a hazard ratio of 5.0 would be 19.  
 The total of 34 events  (acute Grade III- IV GVHD or death within 180 days) are required 
to meet power specifications.   
 Based on the phase II a trial, 1 event occurred in 18 patients in 180 days (which is defined 
as 1.000 unit), so the Baseline Event Rate (BER0) = 1/18 = 0.055.  All event -free patients 
will be f ollowed for  180 days with a censoring rate (CR)=0.000. Calculator 2 indicates the 
same size required to achieve the required number of events:   
 Group 1, matched control s = 75 
 Group 0, CD24Fc treated subjects = 19  
 
An additional patient will be included in the treatment arm to allow for one case of patient 
withdrawal  or loss to follow up.  
 
The sample size for an unmatched logrank test (80% power; 2- sided alpha=0.05) would 
be 260 subjects (52 CD24Fc versus 208 control) to detect a difference of 0.1914 between 0.9450 and 0.7536--the proportions alive and free of aGVHD by day 18 0.   This 
corresponds to a hazard ratio of 5.0.  The calculation assumes proportional hazard rates, 
with no loss to follow -up.   
 With 1:4 matching, a total of 245 subjects (49 CD24Fc versus 196 controls) provides 81% power to detect a difference of at least 0.206 between the proportions surviving in the treated group 1 (0.734) and control group 2 (0.940). This corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.2000. The intracluster correlation coefficient is 0.000. The power calculation is based on a two- sided logrank test (alpha=0.05) and assumes hazard rates are proportional.  The 
design requires 11 events in treated group and 44 events in the matched controls.

1 INTRODU CTION  
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  provides a description of the statistical method ology  to be 
implemented for data analysis of the study described in  OncoImmune Inc. , Protocol CD24Fc -
002 (Version 3.2; 2 August 2017) . If circumstances arise during the study such that more 
appropriate analytic procedures become available, the SAP may be revised.  Any deviations 
from this analysis plan will be substantiated by sound statistical rati onale and will be 
documented in the final clinical study report.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective (s) 
The primary objectives of this  Phase II clinical  study are to establish the safety, tolerability 
and efficacy of CD24Fc in combination with standard prop hylaxis for preventing acute Graft -
versus -host disease (GVHD ) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  (HCT ).

3 STUDY OVERVIEW  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a multi -center Phase II  study of a GVHD prevention in patients with hematological 
malignancies receiving allogeneic HCT. The primary objectives are a) to evaluate the safety 
and tolerance of single dose and 3 biweekly infusions of CD24Fc with establishment of an 
RP2D or MTD ( Phase II a) and b) to determine the efficacy of CD24Fc when combined with a 
standard prophylactic  treatment for a GVHD ( Phase II b).  
Phase IIa is a randomized double -blind trial comprised of: i) 3 single ascending dose cohorts 
of 8 patients (3:1 treatment:placebo); and ii)  a multi -dosing cohort consisting of 8 patients (3:1 
treatment:placebo) that will receive 3 consecutive biweekly administrations of CD24Fc. If 
CD24Fc demonstrates safety and tolerability in phase IIa, the trial will proceed to an expanded 
randomized, doubl e-blind, phase IIb component at the RP2D powered to evaluate the efficacy 
for adding CD24Fc to standard prophylaxis for the prevention of acute GVHD.      
The study design diagrams are provided below in Figure 1:

Prevention  
3.1.1 Phase IIa: Dose Escalation  
The primary objectives of Phase II a study will be to establish an RP2D or MTD, while 
assessing initial safety and tolerability in the HCT setting. The starting dose will be 240 mg 
which was found to be safe in healthy patient s. The Phase II a dose -escalation will evaluate up 
to three single  dose levels of CD24Fc and one multi -dosing cohort receiving a dosage of 
CD24Fc equivalent to the highest single dose.  The dose escalation plan is outlined in Table 1.

* If a DLT is encountered in the 480 mg single dosing, the initial dosing will be changed into 240 mg.  
In Phase II a, patients will be enrolled into dose escalating cohorts of 8 patient s using a 
randomized 3:1 ratio (6 dosing patient s and 2 placebo) design continuing until the highest 
predetermined dose  level of CD24Fc or until an MTD is reached. Prior to t he highest single 
dose cohort being  enrolled, a multi -dosing cohort will be enrolled. If there is sufficient 
evidence for safety in Phase II a, then the drug will be considered safe for Phase IIb testin g and 
the study will transition into an approximately 180 patient Phase II placebo -controlled study 
at 1:1 ratio to assess efficacy of the clinical regimen.  
3.1.1.1  Dose Limiting Toxicities  
After administration of CD24Fc on day -1, patients will be monitored throu gh day +30 (or +60 
in dose level 2) after transplant to assess for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The following 
events will be considered DLTs:  
 A DLT will be any Grade III or higher non -hematologic toxicity not clearly related to 
the underlying malignanc y, intercurrent infection, or the HCT conditioning regimen. 
Hypersensitivity reactions and other infusion -related reactions will not be considered a 
DLT. Any patient who discontinues the study due to an infusion -related reaction will 
be replaced in the stu dy.  
 Any death not related to relapse or intercurrent infection.  
 Engraftment will be defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC ) >500/mm3 for 3 
consecutive days or >2000/mm3 for 1 day. Failure to engraft by Day +30 will be 
considered a DLT.  
In addition, s topping rules for the occurrence of severe  GVHD ( Grade III-IV) are in place as 
in Protocol CD24FC -002 S ection 17.5  (Version 3.2 ; 2 August 2017 ) and thus the occurrence 
of Grade IV colitis and/or Grade IV  erythroderma (by National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE ) v4.03 criteria) directly attributable to 
GVHD would not be considered in the DLT assessment, but would be considered in the 
stopping rules outlined in that section . Only DLTs encountered during the treatmen t period 
will be counted for safety evaluation unless the event reflects an ongoing toxicity that was 
initiated during the treatment period. The treatment period is defined as the first day of 
treatment with CD24Fc until 30 days after HCT for the single -dosing cohorts or 60 days after 
HCT for the multi -dosing cohort.  To clarify , the observation of colitis and erythrode rma (G rade 
III-IV) directly attributable to GVHD will not constitute a DLT in the Phase II a portion of the

study. This is because (a) a GVHD i s an expected event after HCT and (b) is the specific disease 
state for which we are evaluating dose escalation of CD24Fc. In the Phase II b portion, where 
efficacy at the RP2D will be evaluated, the study will be monitored  for excessive acute GVHD . 
3.1.1.2  Maximum  Tolerated Dose  
Each cohort will initially enroll 8 patient s comprised of six patient s treated with CD24Fc and 
2 patient s receiving placebo. Treatment will be assigned randomly.  
After all 8 patients in a particular cohort have been evaluated for toxicity from day -1 to day 
+30 (or day +60 in dose level 2) after HCT, then if no more than 1 of 6 patients receiving 
CD24Fc encountered DLT, escalation will continue to the next higher d ose level. To facilitate 
this process, the study statistician will necessarily have to unblind the assignments of the 
patient s in order to know whether DLTs occurred in CD24Fc treated versus placebo treated 
patients. If ≥ 2 patients receiving CD24Fc encoun ter a DLT, further accrual at that dose level 
or higher will cease with additional patients treated at an intermediate dose level until the 
highest dose level is reached for which 0 or 1 of 6 patients encounters DLT which will be 
declared the MTD. In the e vent that unacceptable toxicity occurs even at dose level 0, with 2 
patients encountering DLTs, then a subsequent cohort of 6 patients will be treated at the -1 
dose level, and if ≥ 2 patients encounter DLT at this reduced dose level, then the trial will b e 
suspended until an amendment can be submitted.  
3.1.1.3  Determination of Recommended Phase 2 Dose  
When the last patient dosed in the Phase II a study reaches 100 days after HCT, key outcome 
data will be locked and the study will then be unblinded. At this point , an interim report will 
be generated in order to define the RP2D. The R2PD will be defined at a dosage of CD24Fc 
equal to or lower than the MTD and the assessment of Pharmacodynamics (PD) and PK data 
based on the studies outlined in Section 2.3 will be used to evaluate biological activity of the 
drug and to assist in deciding RP2D. As a result, the Phase 2 dose will be  the lowest dose with 
maximal effect to the extent that this can be determined from the proposed correlative studies. 
For example, in the absen ce of an MTD, if we observe similar biological activity of the drug 
at two different dose levels, the lower dose will be used as the RP2D.  
However, no formal rules for selecting RP2D based on PD will be defined in this protocol and 
the proposed correlativ e studies are exploratory. If an MTD has been established, it is possible 
investigators and sponsor will determine that the RP2D is lower than the MTD based on other 
safety concerns or the overall tolerability of CD24Fc. This assessment will be based on al l 
available safety and tolerability data, including but not limited to DLT events and comparison 
to placebo controls.

3.2 Phase IIb  
After determination of the RP2D in Phase II a, the Phase II b study will involve a randomized, 
double blind, component where patie nts will receive either standard GVHD prophylaxis with 
CD24Fc at the RP2D determined in Phase II a (Arm A) versus standard GVHD prophylaxis 
with placebo (Arm B). A total of approximately 90 patients will be enrolled in each treatment 
arm.  
This portion of t he study will evaluate whether combining CD24Fc at the RP2D with standard 
prophylaxis provides evidence of clinical efficacy in the prevention of acute GVHD. Since the 
potential efficacy of CD24Fc in GVHD prevention is not established, this agent will be 
combined with a standard of care regimen of tacrolimus and methotrexate in a randomized 
placebo controlled trial.  
3.3 Study Population s 
The study population will comprise male and  non-pregnant, non -lactating  female patient s over 
18 years old, who are  prospectiv e patient s for allogeneic HCT for Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
(AML), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) , Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)  and other 
hematological malignancies . A matched unrelated donor and the recipient must have a  Human 
leukocyte antigens (HLA )-8/8 allelic ma tch at the HLA -A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 loci. Patients 
must have generally normal or near normal organ function as defined by their treating 
institutions bone marrow transplant  program.  
Additional  inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Protocol CD24FC -002 (Version 3.2; 2 
August 2017).  
3.4 Randomization and Blinding  
3.4.1 Randomizat ion and Blinding for Phase IIa  
A total of 32 patients will be randomized in 4 cohorts of 8 patient s. The starting dose will be 
240 mg which was found to be safe in healthy patient s. The dose escalation plan is outlined in 
Table 1.  
Each cohort will initially enroll 8 patients  comprised of 6 patien ts receiving  CD24Fc and 2 
patients receiving placebo . Treatment will be assigned randomly. Patients will be randomized 
in blocks of size 4, with 3 patients receiving CD24Fc an d 1 patient receiving placebo.  
A patient may be designated for replacement per t he criteria specified in the protocol. If a 
patient is designated for replacement, the system will assign the next patient to the same 
treatment group as the original patient, selecting  the lowest matching row in the "Replacement 
Blocks" section of the sch edule .

3.4.2 Randomization and Blinding fo r Phase IIb  
Following confirmation of eligibility and registration, patients will be randomly assigned in an 
up-front fashion to receive one of the following GVHD prophylaxis regimens in a 1:1 
allocation ratio.  
Arm A : CD24Fc + Tacrolimus + Methotrexate (n=90)  
Arm B : Placebo + Tacrolimus + Methotrexate (n=90)  
Randomization will be stratified by study site and source of donor cells (peripheral blood 
versus bone marrow). The study statistician will create randomization lists for both sites prior 
to study initiation, and individual copies will be held by the study biostatistician, the primary 
pharmacists (at sites where the patients are being enrolled) and unblinded study monitors who 
is independent from the study .  
3.4.3 Unbli nding of Study Assignment  
Both Phase IIa and Phase IIb are randomized double -blinded studies. In situations where the 
treating physician believes that knowledge of the treatment assignment will clearly enhance 
patient care, the treating physician will cont act either the principal investigator or one of study 
chairs, who will direct the local study pharmacist to unblind the treating physician. All other 
members of the study team (except study monitors) will remain blinded to assignment. In the 
randomized Phase IIa portion unblinding will be necessary if DLTs occur in order to determine 
dose escalation and for safety monitoring and reporting. When the last patient of the Phase II a 
study reach ed 100 days, the data for a GVHD incidence, DLTs, engraftment, relapse  and 
infection will be locked and the study will be unblinded.  
In Phase II a, unblinding will be necessary if DLTs occur in order to determine dose escalation 
and for safety monitoring and reporting .

NOTE : Pre and Post -transplant observations. Patient condition and scheduling issues may impact the time of post -HCT obser vation s. The acceptable 
time frame for completing these observations is ± 3 days through da y 30, ± 5 days for observations from day 31 until  day 100 , and ± 7 to 14 days for 
observations from day 100 to day 365 . Collection windows do not apply to early PK studies which should be collected around the time of CD24Fc infusion.  
 
1) Per institution practice guidelines: Recipient organ function testing will i nclude MUGA or Echocardiography , Electrocardiogram,  and Pulmonary 
Function Testing . Donor safety and eligibility assessments and screening for i nfectious disease markers  will be performed according to national marrow 
donor program (NMDP) guidelines. These include  but are not limited to screening for  HIV, Hep atitis B and C , HTLV I/II, HSV antibody,  Trypanosoma 
cruzi , west nile virus, syphilis  and CMV . The Pulmonary Function Test may be assessed up to 6 weeks prior to enrollment.   
2) Laboratory tests include Complete Blood Count (CBC ) with differential, serum chemistries  with creatinine, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin  in pre-HCT 
period.  CBC with differential, serum electrolytes with creatinine, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin will be performed at a minimum on the day  of CD24Fc  
infusion and three times weekly from day 0 until ANC > 500/ul, while hospitalized for HCT. Tacrolimus  levels will be monitored at a minimum of three 
times (e.g. every 48 -72 hours) for the first week post CD24fc infusion (day 0 to day 7) and then per institution clinical practice guidelines. CBC with 
differential, serum electrolytes with creatinine, AST, A LT, and total bilirubin then performed weekly through day 29 and performed every other week 
through day 100 post HCT. Laboratory testing may be more frequent per standard HCT practice.  
3) 12 lead ECG monitoring will be performed at 3 time points to assess car diac safety signals.  On Day -1, the ECG should be measured within four hours 
of start of study drug infusion and 2 hours (± 15 minutes) post drug (i.e. 2 hours after the start of infusion). ECG should be measured  3 hours  (± 15 
min) post drug  in the 960mg dosing cohort due to pro longed infusion time (i.e. 3 hours  after the start of infusion) . 
4) Per protocol, CD24Fc will be administered on day -1. See protocol section 7.1 for instructions on identifying and managing infusion reactions.  
5) Frequent vital sign monitoring is required following CD24Fc infusion. Vital signs will be recorded prior to infusion and at approximately 15, 30, 60, and 
120 minutes from the star t of the CD24Fc infusion.  
6) Assessment for a GVHD will occur weekly through day 100. Foll owing  day 100 acute and chronic GVHD assessments will occur  approximately at a 
quarterly schedule (day 180 and day 270 ± 14 days) . Consensus a GVHD grading will be used to report disease severity (APPENDIX C)  
7) Research samples include PBSC and serum from patient s at indicated time points  to be cyropreserved  for correlative immunologic studie s.  
8)  In the pre -HCT period, a research sample from the donor HCT product wil l also be cryopreserved  prior to infusion .

NOTE : Pre and Post -transplant observations. Patient condition and scheduling issues may impact the time of post -HCT obser vation s. The acceptable 
time frame for completing these observations is ± 3 days through da y 60, ± 5 days for observations from day 61 until  day 100 , and ± 7 to 14 days for 
observations from day 100 to day 365 . Collection windows do not apply to early PK studies which should be collected around the time of CD24Fc infusion.  
 
1) Per institution practice guidelines: Recipient organ function testing will i nclude MUGA or Echocardiography , Electrocardiogram,  and Pulmonary 
Function Testing . Donor safety and eligibility asse ssments and screening for i nfectious disease markers  will be performed according to national marrow 
donor program (NMDP) guidelines. These include  but are not limited to screening for  HIV, Hep atitis B and C , HTLV I/II, HSV antibody,  Trypanosoma 
cruzi , west nile virus, syphilis  and CMV . The Pulmonary Function Test may be collected up to 6 weeks prior to enrollment.  
2) Laboratory tests include CBC with differential, serum chemistries  with creatinine, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin  in pre -HCT period.  CBC with differential, 
serum electrolytes with creatinine, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin will be performed at a minimum on the day  of CD24Fc  infusion and three times weekly 
from day 0 until ANC > 500/ul, while hospitalized for HCT. Tacrolimus levels will b e monitored per institution clinical practice guidelines. CBC with 
differential, serum electrolytes with creatinine, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin then performed weekly through day 59 and performed every other week 
through day 100 post HCT. Laboratory test ing may be more frequent per standard HCT practice.  
3) 12 lead ECG monitoring will be performed at 3 time points to assess cardiac safety signals.  On Day -1, Day 14 and Day 28, the ECG should be 
measured within four hours o f start of study drug infusion and 2  hours (± 15 minutes) post drug (i.e. 2 hours after the start of infusion).  
4) Per protocol, CD24Fc will be administered on day -1, day 14 and day 28. See protocol section 7.1 for instructions on identifying and managing infusion 
reactions.  
5) Frequent vital si gn monitoring is required following CD24Fc infusion. Vital signs will be recorded prior to infusion and at approximately 15, 30, 60, and 
120 minutes from the  start of the CD24Fc infusion.  
6) Assessment for a GVHD will occur weekly through day 100. Following  day 100 acute and chronic GVHD assessments will occur  approximately at a 
quarterly schedule (day 180 and day 270 ± 14 days) . Consensus a GVHD grading will be used to report disease severity (APPENDIX C).  
7) Anti-drug-antibody / PK samples: Blood samples should b e taken before infusion and 2 hours after completing the CD24Fc infusion (on day -1, day 14, 
and day 28). Additional ADA/PK samples to be drawn on day 7, day 21, day 35, day 42 , day 56, day 70, and day 100.  
8) Research samples include PBSC and serum from patient s. Research samples should be taken at the following time points  to be cyropreserved  for 
correlative immunologic studie s: Baseline (Day -7, prior to initiating conditioning), prior to infusion on Day -1, Day 14, and Day 28, Day 42, Day 56 and 
Day 10 0.  
9)  In the pre -HCT period, a research sample from the donor HCT product wil l also be cryopreserved  prior to infusion .

4 STUDY VARIABLES  
4.1 Efficacy Variables   
4.1.1 Primary Efficacy Variable in Phase IIa  
Not applicable  for Phase IIa .  
Efficacy analyses are considered as secondary for Phase IIa.  
4.1.2 Primary Efficacy Variable  in Phase IIb  
The incidence of Grade II -IV aGVHD following HCT will be the primary efficacy endpoint in 
the Phase II b portion of the study.  
4.1.2.1  Cumulative Incidence  of Grade II -IV Ac ute GVHD  
The primary efficacy variable of the Phase IIb portion is the cumulative incidence of G rade II -
IV aGVHD at day +100 following matched unrelated donor myeloablative HCT. This reflects 
the most established GVHD endpoint in the HCT field based on prior GVHD prevention 
studies.  Acute  GVHD will be monitored  through aGVHD  assessments beginning on day 0 
(date of HCT) and continuing approximately weekly through day +100. Following day +100, 
aGVHD assessments will occur approximately quarterly through da y +270.  
Consensus a GVHD grading will be used to report disease severity. Acute GVHD severity will 
be determined by the Investigator and graded from 0 -IV for the skin, liver, and gut and this 
will be used to determine the overall clinical severity. The ove rall clinical grade from 0 -IV will 
be determined based on Protocol CD24FC -002 Appendix C (Version 3.2; 2 August 2017).  
The cumulative incidence of acute Grade II -IV GVHD will be calculated starting on  the date 
of transplantation until the earlier of t he do cumented Grade II -IV a GVHD or death  (as a 
competing risk) .  Patients that are alive with no occurrence of Grade II -IV acute GVHD 
through day +100 will be censored at their last assessment for aGVHD on or prior to day +100.  
4.1.3 Key Secondary  Efficacy Variable  
The key secondary efficacy variable in Phase II b will be acute Grade II -IV GVHD free survival  
through day +180 following HCT.  
4.1.3.1  Acute GVHD Free Survival  
In Phase II b, Grade II -IV acute GFS is also a key secondary endpoint at day +180. Grade II -IV 
acute GFS is defined as the time from the date of HCT  to the earlier of the  dates of the first 
documented G rade II-IV aGV HD (as assessed by the Investigator)  or death due to any cause.  
06C796
OncoImmune, Inc.  
CD24Fc -002 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                                                                Page 23 
 
For the purposes  of GFS, events will be considered as either death or the occurrence of Grade 
II-IV aGVHD (as assessed by the Investigator) following HCT. Thus GFS will be calculated 
in days as:  
 Grade II -IV GFS = date of death/G rade II -IV aGVHD – date of HCT + 1  
Patients that are alive and have no documented occurrence of Grade II -IV aGVHD at the data 
cutoff date will be cen sored at the last date of a GVHD assessment  on or prior to day +180 .  
Furthermore, G rade II I-IV acute  GFS through Day +180 following HCT is defined as t he time 
from the date of HCT  to the earlier of the  dates of the first documented G rades III-IV aGV HD 
(as assessed by the Investigator)  or death due to any cause.  For the purposes of this endpoint, 
events will be considered as eit her death or the occurrence  of G rade III -IV acute GFS (as 
assessed by the Investigator) following HCT. Grade III -IV acute GFS will be calculated in 
days as:  
 Grade III -IV GFS = d ate of death/grade III -IV aGVHD – date of HCT + 1  
Patients that are alive and have no documented occurrenc e of Gra de III -IV aGVHD at the data 
cutoff date will be censored at the last  date of a GVHD assessment  on or prior to day +180 . 
4.1.4 Other Secondary Efficacy Variables  
The following secondary efficacy variables will be considered.  
 Cumulative i ncidence of c hronic GVHD (cGVHD) at one year following HCT  
 Incidence of relapse at one year following HCT  
 Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM)  at one year following HCT   
 Disease Free Survival  (DFS)  at one year following HCT  
 Incidence of infection at day +100 following HCT  
 OS at one year following HCT  
 GvHD -Free and Relapse -Free Survival (GRFS) at one year following HCT  
4.1.4.1  Cumulative Incidence of Chronic GVHD  
Chronic GVHD assessments will occur approximately quarterly beginning on day +100 after 
HCT  until one year after HCT .  
Chron ic GVHD assessments will be performed for the following areas: skin, gastrointestinal, 
eyes, lung, liver, mouth, joints/fascia, genitals, and other organs. Chronic GVHD severity will 
be Graded as I (mild), II (moderate), or III (severe) for each area where  chronic GVHD is 
present.  A global severity will also be assessed by the investigator.

OncoImmune, Inc.  
CD24Fc -002 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                                                                Page 24 
 
The cumulative incidence of cGVHD at one year will be calculated starting on  the date of HCT 
until the earlier of the documented cGVHD or death (as a competing risk).  
Patients that are alive and do not experience cGVHD  at the end of the follow -up period (day 
+365) will be censored at the last date of evaluation.  
4.1.4.2  Incidence of Relapse  
Patients that undergo HCT will be evaluated for the relapse of disease until the end of the 
follow -up period. The follow -up period is defined as the first day the patient is no longer within 
the treatment period (i.e. day 31 or day 61) until one year post HCT.  If applicable, the date of 
relapse and type will be recorded in on the eCRF.  
The c umulative incidence of relapse at one year will be calculated starting on  the date of HCT 
until the earlier of the documented relapse or death (as a competing risk).  
Patients that are alive and do not experience relapse at the end of the follow -up period (day 
+365) will be censored at the last date of evaluation.  
4.1.4.3  Cumulative Incidence of Non -Relapse Mortality  
Patients that undergo HCT will be assessed for mortality related to the HCT procedure (TRM) 
through the end of the follow -up period.  
TRM will be evaluated through the cumulative incidence of NRM at one year and will be 
calculated starting on  the date of HCT until death without relapse or relapse (as a competing 
risk).  
Patients that are alive at the end of the follow -up period (day +365) without re lapse will be 
censored at the last date they were known to be alive.  
4.1.4.4  Disease  Free Surviva l 
In Phase II a and Phase II b, patients that undergo HCT will be evaluated for the relapse of 
disease until the end of the follow -up period . If applicable, the date of relapse and type will be 
recorded in on the electronic case report form (eCRF) . DFS will be defined as the length of 
time after HCT to the earlier of death or  disease relapse .  
For patients that undergo HCT, DFS will be calcula ted as: 
 DFS = date of death/ relapse – date of HCT + 1  
Patients that are alive and do not experience disease relapse at the end of the follow -up period 
will be censored at the last date of evaluation.

4.1.4.5  Overall Survival  
Patients  that undergo HCT will be follo wed for OS through the end of the follow -up period 
lasting approximately 365 days after the date of HCT.  
OS will be calculated in days as:  
 OS = date of death – date of HCT + 1  
Patients that are alive at the end of the follow -up period will be censored at the last date that 
they were known to be alive.  
4.1.4.6  GVHD -Free and Relapse -Free Survival  
GRFS is a com posite endpoint in which events include Grade III -IV aGVHD , cGVHD 
requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy, relapse, or death from any cause. GRFS is 
defined as the time from the date of HCT to the earlier of the dates of the first documented 
Grade III -IV GVHD, first documented disease relapse, or death from any cause.  
GRFS will be calculated in days as:  
 GRFS = date of grade III -IV GVHD/relapse/death – date of HCT + 1  
Patients that are alive and have no documented occurrence of Grade III -IV aGVHD , cGVHD 
requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy, or relapse at the data cutoff date will be 
censored at the last assessment date.  
4.2 Safety  Variables  
Safety parameters will include assessments for DLTs,  adverse event s (AEs), Treatment -
emergent adverse event s (TEAEs ), prior and concomitant medications, dosing and extent of 
exposure, Karnofsky Performance Status  (KPS) , vital sign measurements, clinical laborat ory 
parameters, Electrocardiogram (ECG ) parameters , ADAs , and bone marrow aspirate.   
4.2.1 Dose Limiting Toxicities  
The incidence of DLTs  is the primary endpoint for the Phase II a portion of the study. For the 
definition of DLTs, please refer to Section 3.1.1.1.  
The incidence of DLTs occurring during the DLT evaluation period (day +30 after HCT for 
single dose cohorts or day +60 for multi -dose) will determine if further dose escalation will 
occur.  
4.2.2 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clini cal investigation patient  administered a 
pharmaceutical product regardless of causality assessment. An AE can be an unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome, or disease 
06C796
OncoImmune, Inc.  
CD24Fc -002 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                                                                Page 26 
 
temporarily associated with or occ urring during the use of an investigational product whether 
or not considered related to the investigational product. As such, the AEs will be continuously 
followed and reported after the study patient s have been started on the investigational drug and 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF .  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g. ECG ) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at screening and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as AEs.  
The rel ationship of each AE to study drug will be recorded  as: 
 Definitely related: clearly associated with study drug/treatment  
 Probably related: likely associated with study drug/treatment  
 Possibly related: may be associated with study drug or other treatment   
 Unlikely to be related, or 
 Definitely not related to the study drug/treatment  
AEs will be collected from the time of the infusion of the investigational drug , continuously 
through the Treatment Period. The exact days may vary depending on the last day of 
administration of study drug without constituting a deviation. Thus, the assessment and 
reporting period for AEs including DLT  potentially related to the study drug (CD24Fc) will 
extend through day 30 post HCT for the single -dosing cohorts or day 60 post HC T for the 
multi -dosing cohort . All SAEs that the investigator considers related to study drug occurring 
after 30 days post HCT for the single -dosing cohorts or 60 days post HCT for the multi -dosing 
cohort must be reported to the Principal Investigator and Coordinating Center.  
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE v4.03 will be utilized for all events with 
an assigned CTCAE grading. If a CTCAE grade is not given it will not be imputed. AEs will 
be coded and classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term according to the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, v19.0).  
For each episode of an AE, all changes to the CTCAE grade attained, as well as the highest 
attained CTCAE (Version  4.0) grade, should be recorded . The assessment by the Investigator 
regarding the relationship between study drug  and the AE will also be recorded.  
4.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) 
Drug Dictionary ( Version 2016E B2 ). Prior medications are medications used and stopped 
before the first dose of study drug. Concomitant medications are medications that were taken 
on or after the first dose of study drug.

4.2.9 Engraftment, Graft Failure and Chimerism  
4.2.9.1  Engraftment  and Engraftment  Failure  
Patients undergoing HCT will be monitored for transplant engraftment after the procedure is 
completed. Engraftment will be evaluated through the collection of hematology laboratory 
samples at the times indicated in the Study Calendar (Table 2 A and Table 2B ).  
Engraftment for neutrophils will be defined as the first of three consecutive days in which the 
ANC is >500/uL. Engraftment for platelets will be defined as the first  of three consecutive 
days in which the platelet count is >20,000/uL, without transfusion support within the 
preceding 7 days.  
Primary engraftment failure will be defined as ongoing ANC < 500/uL by day 28 post HCT. 
Failure to attain platelet count ≥ 20,00 0/uL will not be considered engraftment failure. In 
addition, patients who engraft prior to day 28 and later have ANC < 500/uL or platelet 
transfusion requirement will not be considered to have engraftment failure.  
4.2.9.2  Chimerism

The following PK parameters of CD24Fc  will be will be calculated  using all the PK 
concentration data collected , if applicable :  
Parameters  Units  Description  
AUC 0-last ngd/mL   The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, from

used in place of the nominal 100 days   
The PK parameters λz and t½ will not be presented for patient s who do not exhibit a terminal 
elimination phase in their concentration -time profiles. To estimate the first -order terminal 
elimination constant, linear regression of concentration (on the logarithmic scale) vs time will 
be performed using at least 3 time p oints with measurable plasma concentrations. Uniform 
weighting will be selected to perform the regression analysis to estimate PK parameters.  
The constant λz will not be assigned if the terminal elimination phase is not apparently linear 
(as it appears on a semi -logarithmic  scale), if  tmax is one of the last 3 data points, if the 
regression coefficient is less than 0.8,  if the extrapolated is greater than 40%, or if the estimated 
elimination  rate indicates a positive slope. In cases where λz is not assigned , the values of 
associated parameters such as t½ and AUC 0-inf will not be calculated.  
The Linear Up Log Down method (equivalent to the Linear Up/Log Down option in 
WinNonlin® Professional) will be u sed in the computation of AUCs.

5 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINA TION  
A maximum total of 212 patients are expected to complete the Phase IIa and Phase IIb 
components of this trial. This estimate assumes a maximum of  32 patient s recruited to the 
Phase IIa dose escalation component and a maximum of 180 patient s enrolled in Phase IIb.  
With 180 patients (90 per arm), and assuming a Type I (alpha) error rate of 5%, there will be 
80% power to detect a reduction in the pri mary endpoint of GVHD incidence at day 100 from 
50% to 30%  in Phase IIb of the trial . The total sample size will be lower if DLTs are 
encountered in Phase IIa or a stopping rule is met in Phase IIb .

7 GENERAL STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
The primary objective of the Phase II a portion of this study is to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of single dose and 3 biweekly infusions of CD24Fc in order to establish an RP2D 
or MTD. If such a dose is established, the study will proceed to Phase II b in order to determine 
the efficacy  of CD24Fc when combined with a standard prophylactic treatment for acute 
GVHD.  
Unless otherwise stated, d escriptive statistics including the number of observations (n ), mean, 
standard deviation , median, minimum, and maximum will be presented for continuou s

variables. Frequencies and percentages will be presented for categorical and ordinal variables. 
Percentages will be based on the number of non -missing values in a dose group.  
Summ ary tables will be presented separately for Phase II a and Phase II b and by treatment arm. 
For Phase IIa, s ummary tables will present results by cohort for each dose and placebo, where 
the placebo patients will be combined across dose cohorts. For Phase IIb, summary tables will 
present results by treatment group.  
7.1 Adjustment for Co variates  
In Phase II b, the primary and key secondary efficacy  analys es will be stratified by transplant 
source ( peripheral blood stem cell [PBSC]  or bone marrow ).  
7.2 Baseline  Definition  
Whe re applicable, baseline measurements will be defined as the last obse rvation before the 
first administration  of the study drug  (CD24Fc or placebo) . 
7.3 Multicenter Studies  
The center effect will not be considered for this study.  
7.4 Multiple Comparisons  
Not applicable for Phase IIa.  
For Phase IIb, formal statistical tests are plann ed for the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints. To control the family -wise type 1 error rate at 5%, a sequential testing procedure 
will be utilized to test the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, with each being tested 
at α = 0.05. If the primary endpoint is statistically  significant at α = 0.05, testing may continue 
to the key secondary efficacy endpoint.  
No adjustment to the type I error rate will be made for the interim futility analysis.  
There is no plan to control for the  overall alpha for other  secondary efficacy analyses .  
7.5 Missing Data  
In general, missing data values will be recorded as missing and will not be imputed for the 
statistical analysis unless specified otherwise. Only recorded data values will be used for the 
reporting of descriptive statistics, unless specified otherwise.  
Missing Dates : In cases of missing or incomplete dates (e.g. AE and concomitant medications), 
the missing component(s) will be assumed as the most conservative value possible. For 
example, A Es with missing start dates, but with stop dates either overlapping into the treatment 
period or missing, will be counted as treatment -emergent, taking the worst -case approach. 
When partial dates are present in the data, both a partial start date and/or a partial stop date will

OncoImmune, Inc.  
CD24Fc -002 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                                                                Page 35 
 
be evaluated to determine whether it can be conclusively established that the AE started prior 
to the start of study drug or ended prior to the start of study drug. If the above cannot be 
conclusively established based on the partial  and/or present dates, then the AE will be 
considered as treatment -emergent. Actual data values as they appear in the original case report 
forms (CRFs) will be presented in the data listings . 
7.5.1 Missing Pharmacokinetics Data  
For missing predose concentration  values in single dose data, the missing component(s) will 
be assumed as zero. For steady -state, the minimum observed during dose interval will be used 
as predose concentration values.  
Non-quantifiable  (NQ)  data will be handled based on the current knowle dge of drug PK 
measures. If one or more NQ values occur in a profile before the first measurable concentration 
or after the last measurable concentration, they will be assigned a value of zero concentration. 
For linear plots, zero concentration value(s) be fore the first measurable concentration will be 
included in the plot. For log -linear plots, zero concentration value(s) before the first measurable 
concentration will be assigned a missing value.   
7.6 Examination of Subgroups  
No subgroup analyses are planned for the study.  The efficacy analysis will include adjustment 
for the source of donor cells (peripheral blood versus bone marrow) in order to reduce the 
potential for bias.

8.2 Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy analysis and secondary efficacy analyses in Phase II b will be performed 
based on the mITT Population.  Efficacy analyses for Phase II a will be based on the mITT  
Population and will be descriptive, that is, no formal hypothesis test will be performed on the 
Phase II a data. Efficacy data from the Phase IIa part of the s tudy and Phase IIb part of the study 
will be summarized separately.  
Summary tables and analyses will present results by treatment group  in Phase II a and Phase 
IIb. For Phase IIa, placebo patients will be combined across dose cohorts.  
8.2.1 Primary  Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint for Phase IIb is the cumulative incidence of Grade II -IV 
aGVHD at day +100 following HCT  for the mITT Popualtion . The cumulative incidence for 
Grade II -IV aGVHD between the two treatment groups will be compared using competing 
risks regression  on treatment arm  via the semiparametric  method  of Fine and Gray  [1], stratified 
by the donor stem cell source, to account for the competing risk o f death without Grade II -IV 
aGVHD . The hypothesis  test will compare the resulting cumulative incidence estimates and  
determine the statistical sig nificance of the difference in the cumulative incidence functions by 
day +100 between the two treatment arms  (CD24Fc or placebo) in Phase II b.  
The hypothesis test for the primary efficacy variable in Phase II b will be carried out with a 
type I (alpha) error rate of 5% (two -sided). The primary efficacy analysis will compare whether 
subjects treated with the combination of CD24Fc plus standard prophylaxis have a cumul ative  
incidence of Grade II -IV a GVHD equal to that of subjects receiving standard GVHD 
prophylaxis with placebo, stratifying  for the source of donor stem cells. The point estimate of 
the hazard ratio and the accompanying 95% confidence interval will also b e presented.  
The primary analysis will be performed using intention to treat principle; hence all randomized 
patients in the mITT Population in Phase II b will be included for the primary analysis  based 
on the randomized treatment group, regardless of the actual treatment received .  
The estimate of the cumulative incidence of Grade II -IV aGVHD  by day +100 as well as the 
2-sided 95% confidence interval s will be obtained from  the cumulative incidence function and 
presented  by treatment arm . Plots of the cumul ative incidence curves will be presented by 
treatment arm.

presented  by treatment arm for the mITT Population (with subjects receiving placebo pooled 
across enrollment  cohorts). Plots of the cumula tive incidence curves for Grade II -IV aGVHD 
will be presented by treatment arm.

8.6 Interim Analysis   
When the last patient dosed in Phase II a reaches 100 days after HCT, key outcome data will 
be locked and the Phase II a portion of the study will be unblinded. At this point, an interim 
report will be generated in order to define the RP2D. The RP2D will be defined at a dosage of 
CD24Fc equal to or lower than the MTD and will further consider PK and PD data. The Phase 
IIb dose will be the lowest dose with maximal effect to the extent that this can be determined 
from the proposed correlative studies.  
Further, the Phase II b portion of the study will contain an interim analysis for futility (lack of 
evidence of lower GVHD rat e in Arm A versus Arm B), as well as for unacceptably greater 
rates of engraftment failure or mortality in Arm A versus Arm B. The interim analysis for 
futility will be done after 50% of the enrollment (90 patient s) has been reached.  
A final analysis comp aring the GVHD rates in the two arms will be done after all patients are 
evaluable. At the interim analysis, the trial will be halted if the numbers of patients with Grade  
II-IV GVHD in the two arms differs by 2 or less, i.e. 10 patients in one arm and 12 in the other. 
This corresponds to a chi -squared test for comparing the GVHD rates in the two arms having 
a p-value of 0.5 or higher . The final analysis will require a p -value of 0.05 or less to d efine 
statistical significance and this value will not be adj usted for any interim analyses.  
Table 3  contains the minimum number of patients with the indicated events in Phase II b 
regardless of treatment assignment that would lead to the study being terminated for excessive 
graft failure, mortality before day 100, o r excessive Grade III -IV acute GVHD. A graft failure 
rate exceeding 5% will be considered excessive. Similarly, based upon national benchmarks 
for survival outcomes reported from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Research (CIBMTR ) registry for myeloablative unrelated donor HCT evidence that the true 
day 100 mortality exceeds 25% would be considered excessive. Based on these assumptions, 
with 30 evaluable patients, the trial would be terminated if at least 4 patient s experienced graft 
failure or if at least 11 patient s died within 100 days of transplant from any cause. Additionally, 
for patient s receiving the RP2D dose of CD24Fc, evidence of greater than a 35% incidence of 
Grade III -IV aGVHD at day 100 would be considered excessive and the trial would be halted.

The stopping boundaries were determined from cumulative binomial probabilities. With a true 
graft failure rate of 0.05, the study would terminate early (see at least 4 of 30 patients wit h 
graft failure by Day 28, etc.) with a probability of 0.06, while with true graft failure rates of 
0.10 and 0.15, the study would terminate early with probabilities of 0.352 and 0.678, 
respectively. Moreover, stopping early occurs most often after 30 pati ents, meaning that in 
settings of excessive graft failure, stopping will occur very quickly. Similarly, with a true Day 
100 mortality rate of 25%, the study would terminate early (see at least 11 of 30 patients dying 
within 100 days of transplant, etc.) wi th probability 0.105, while with true mortality rates of 
0.30 and 0.35, the study would terminate early with probabilities of 0.27 and 0.492, 
respectively.  
With a true Day 100 Grade III -IV aGVHD rate of 35%, the study would terminate early (see 
at least 13  of 30 patients with Grades III -IV aGVHD within 100 days of transplant, etc.) with 
probability 0.220, while with true mortality rates of 0.26 and 0.35, the study would terminate 
early (see at least 11 of 30 patients dying within 100 days of transplant) wit h probabilities of 
0.132 and 0.492, respectively.  
9 GENERAL INFORMATION  
9.1 Statistical Software  
The creation of analysis datasets and statistical analyses will be done using SAS® version 9.3  
or higher.  The Medpace standard operating procedures (Medpace documents GL-DS-02-S2.2 
and GL -DS-03-S1.1) will be followed for the validation of all SAS programs and outputs.  
9.2 Format of Tables, Listings, and Figures  
The format of tables, listings, and figures will be described in a stand -alone programming 
speci fications document and will be finalized before database lock for the study.  
10 CHANGES FROM PROTOCOL SPECIFIED ANALYSIS  
For the primary efficacy endpoint , cumulative incidence of Grade II -IV aGVHD , the protocol 
states non -relapse mortality (NRM) will be considered as a competing risk. However, all deaths 
will be considered as compelting risk  in the statistical analysis .

 Précis 
  Serum cholesterol is transpor ted by lipoproteins, such as VLDL,  LDL and HDL, which 
vary in their relationship to cardiovascular disease risk. LDL,  for example, is proatherogenic, 
whereas HDL is cardio-protec tive.  Long-chain monounsaturated f atty acids (LCMUFA), 
fatty acids over 18 carbons in l ength with a single double bond , have been shown in mice to 
decrease proatherogenic lipoprot eins, such as LDL, and reduce a therosclerosis. This study 
will test the hypothesis that LCMUFA supplementation in humans will favorably alter the 
lipoprotein lipid profile in regar d to cardiovascular disease r isk. In addition, we will assess 
other parameters related to lipoprotein composition and functio n, as well as other biomarkers 
related to coagulati on and inflammation, whi ch have previously been shown to be affected by 
supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids.   
 This clinical research project i s designed as a pilot, randomiz ed, double-blinded, crossover 
study that will investigate the effect of a fish oil enriched w ith LCMUFA on lipoprotein 
metabolism. Subjects will receive control fish oil enriched in oleic acid, a monounsaturated 
fatty acid (C18:1), or a fish oil supplement produced from Saur y fish (rich in LCMUFA) for 
approximately 8-10 weeks, with a wash out period of 8-10 weeks between the two arms of the 
study. The study consists of 4 outpati ent visits when laborator y or research samples and CAVI 
tests will be performed. A 7-day food diary, pill count, and re d cell membrane fatty acid levels 
will be monitored to assess compliance.

 1. Objectives 
 
  The overall objective is to eluci date LCMUFA-induced changes on lipoproteins and 
lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, we will focus on the eff ect of LCMUFA 
supplementation on the level of pro- atherogenic cardiovascular biomarkers, such as LDL-C 
and triglycerides, as well as on t he level of anti-atherogenic biomarkers, such as HDL-C. This 
will be first accomplished by performing a small pilot study to  determine the effect size of 
LCMUFA supplementation on lipoprote in parameters to assist in t he design of a possible 
future larger clinical trial. 
2. Introduction 
 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) rem ains the leading cause of death , disability, and healthcare 
expense in the United States and is also a major medical proble m worldwide.  It is well known 
that elevated plasma levels of  cholesterol and triglyceride on lipoproteins are major risk 
factors for CVD.  Dietary lipid s by modulating lipoprotein meta bolism can have a profound 
effect on CVD risk. Unlike pro-athe rogenic saturated fatty acid s, numerous animal and human 
studies have shown that regular  consumption of unsaturated fish  oils have favorable effects on 
serum lipids, as well as on endothelial function, inflammation,  thrombosis and arrhythmia.  
Most of these beneficial effect s have been attributed to omega- 3 fatty acids, such as the long 
chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  eicosapentanoic (EPA, C20:4) and docosaehexanoic (DHA, 
C22:4)1,2.  Fish oils, however, also contain varying amounts of other un usual types of fatty 
acids that are not commonl y found in other food sources.  For e xample, oils derived from 
saury3, pollock4, capelin5, and sprats6, as well as from marine mammals, such as seals and 
whales7, are all enriched in long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (L CMUFA; i.e., C20:1 
and C22:1 isomers combined).  LCMUF A are defined as fatty acids  that are at least 20 
carbons in length and contain on ly one unsaturated carbon doubl e bond.  Food is the primary 
source of LCMUFA, because fatty  acids longer than 18 carbons ar e inefficiently synthesized 
by most mammals, including man.  In terestingly, data from the o riginal epidemiologic studies 
of Eskimos that first establis hed a link between o mega-3 fatty acid consumption and CVD 
protection also showed a possible be neficial role for LCMUFA in  promoting cardiovascular 
health8,9. Studies on the association betw een red blood cell fatty acid levels, a marker of fatty 
acid dietary consumption, and incid ent coronary artery disease in the Physician’s Health 
Study also showed a strong inverse association between LCMUFA c onsumption and CVD, 
even after adjusting for o mega-3 fatty acid levels10.  Recently, we showed in various mouse 
models11,12,13,14 that ingestion of LCMUFA lowers  total cholesterol and reduces 
atherosclerosis (Table 1).

 Saury fish (Cololabis adocetus) are widespread in the surface w aters of the Eastern Pacific 
and are considered to be a pelagic, tropical oceanodromous fish .  It is widely consumed in 
Asian countries, and unlike more commonly eaten fish, such as s ardines, which contain large 
amount of EPA (Table 2), Saury fish contains a very high level of LCMUFA, particularly 
20:1 n-11 (cis-9-eicosenoic acid  or gadoleic acid) and 22:1 n-1 1 (cis-9-cetoleic acid).  Except 
for one past study, which examined the effect of Saury fish con sumption on post-prandial 
lipids and glucose15, no previous  studies have investigated the  effect of long-term 
supplementation of fish oil produ ced from Saury fish on plasma lipoproteins or other 
cardiovascular risk markers.

Although LCMUFA is not abundant i n most diets, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), 
which are fatty acids 18 carbons or less in length with a singl e carbon double bond, are 
relatively abundant.  The most co mmon MUFA in daily nutrition i s oleic acid (C18:1 n-9),

  7  
 and olive oil is one of the major sources of oleic acid. From t he NHANES study, the average 
daily consumption of oleic acid i n the US is nearly 30 grams pe r day16.  Several studies 
indicated an increase of HDL-c holesterol and a corresponding de crease in triglyceride, 
following an oleic acid-rich diet17, 18. The consumption of diets rich in MUFA, particularly 
oleic acid, has been linked to a l ower prevalence of atheroscle rosis and has been shown to 
have beneficial effects o n lipoprotein metabolism19. In type 2 diabetic subjects, oleic acid-rich 
diet exerted a hypoglycemic effect  and reduced glycosylated hem oglobin in the long term20. 
In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Admin istration have approved a Qualified Health Claim for 
olive oil stating the followi ng: “Limited and not conclusive sc ientific evidence suggests that 
eating about 2 tablespoons (23 gram s) of olive oil daily may re duce the risk of coronary heart 
disease due to the monounsaturat ed fat in olive oil. To achieve  this possible benefit, olive oil 
has to replace a similar amount of  saturated fat and not increa se the total number of calories 
you eat in a day.” 21. 
  
      The mechanisms involved in phy siological effects of benef icial fatty acids, such as 
EPA, oleic acid and LCMUFA are  only partially understood. For e xample, Omega-3 fatty 
acids (EPA) are known to be natura l ligands of several nuclear receptors that regulate gene 
expression, including PPAR, hepatic  nuclear factor , liver X rec eptors, and retinoid X 
receptors.  They also alter expres sion of transcription factors , such as sterol regulatory 
element binding-protein and car bohydrate response element bindi ng-protein (ChREBP) 22, 
which may contribute to the physio logic effects of omega-3 fatt y acids on lipid metabolism 
and inflammation. Omega-9 fatty a cid, such as oleic acid, decre ase cholesterol ester transfer 
protein (CETP) levels, a protein m ediates the tr ansfer of chole steryl esters from HDL to 
apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins23. The isoenergetic replacem ent of a high-saturated 
fatty acid diet by a MUFA or a  high-carbohydrate low-fat diet h as been shown to decrease the 
CETP concentration in young, hea lthy, normolipidemic subjects24. In animal studies, 
LCMUFA-rich diet improved the a dipocytokine profile, and result ed in favorable changes in 
triglycerides and LDL-C and in t he expression of several genes involved in glucose/lipid 
metabolism and inflammation (Fig. 1)11, 13, 14. The mechanism for the similar and differential 
effect of EPA, oleic acid and L CMUFA on LDL-C and other lipopro tein changes, however, is 
not fully understood nor whether these differences in lipoprote in metabolism relate to the 
pathogenesis of cardi ovascular disease.

      In this pilot study, we plan to examine the effect of LCM UFA-rich fish oil on lipid and 
lipoprotein metabolism. A fish oil supplement containing a mixt ure of sardine o il and olive oil 
that contains the same amount of Omega-3 fatty acids as the LCM UFA-rich fish oil will be 
used as a control. Given the widespread use of fish oils in the general population  and the 
recent concern about their possible lack of effectiveness for c ardiovascular disease 
protection
25, 26, a more detailed understanding on the effect of various fat on  lipoprotein 
metabolism is needed. Results from this study may lead to new i nsights into the optimum 
mixture of beneficial fatty acids  in fish oil supplements for c ardiovascular health protection.   
 
3. Study Design and Methods 
3.1 Overview 
      
The study will be a prospective double-blinded randomized cross over study, with four 
clinical visits (Fig. 2). During the first visit, subjects will  be screened by an 
exclusion/inclusion qu estionnaire and baseli ne clinical laborat ory testing.  If not excluded, 
subjects may also be assessed for vascular compliance by Cardio -ankle vascular index 
(CAVI) testing27, 28. Exercise and diet changes will be followed by a nutritionist, using a 7-day 
food diary*.

Eligible subjects will be randomi zed to take Control Fish Oil c apsules (CFO - a mixture of 
sardine oil and oleic acid-rich  olive oil) or LCMUFA-rich fish oil capsules produced from 
Saury fish (LCMUFA) as described in Table 3.

 Each fish oil supplementation period will last a minimum of 8 w eeks and subjects receiving 
CFO capsules will receive a daily approximate dose of 3g of tot al omega-3 fatty acids and 
approximately 5g of total MUFA (Table 4). Subjects will return for a second visit at the end 
of this study arm and will discontinue any study related supple ments. After a washout period 
of 8-10 weeks, they will return for a third visit to start the second arm of the study for another 
8 weeks minimum. In case of scheduling problems subjects will c ontinue on supplementation 
up to 2 extra weeks. A fourth a nd last visit will take place at  the end of this second study arm 
and subjects will discontinue any study related supplements. Bl ood samples, as well as stool 
samples (optional), will be collected on each visit for analysi s. CAVI analysis may also take

 place. The participant compliance will be monitored by pill cou nts at the second and fourth 
visits.  In addition, fatty acid composition of red blood cells  will be assessed by GC analysis29.  
Subjects may be contacted by phone or NIH medical secure email system at least once during 
each period to monitor complian ce and any adverse events. Subje cts will also be consented to 
be contacted for possible future  studies. After completion of b oth arms of the study, results 
from each participant will be unb linded for possible data analy sis.

3.2  Visits 
There will be a total of 4 outpa tient visits for this study.  T he return visits can be delayed 
or anticipated up to two weeks, i f there are scheduling problem s (but will be a minimum of 8 
weeks apart).  The first st udy day will be the screening and ba seline measurements, followed 
by three additional visits coinciding with study landmarks. The  study will be discussed in 
detail with interested subject s.  Any procedures needed to asse ss eligibility (i.e. blood 
laboratory tests, pregnancy tes t) will be performed after obtai ning a signed informed consent. 
Prior to the first visit a tel ephone call or email exchange thr ough NIH medical secure email 
system may be used to give general information about the study,  to explain the 
exclusion/inclusion criteria and d escribe the tests that will b e performed but no personally 
identifiable information will be collected. This will not be co nsidered a screening. In addition, 
phone calls/email may be used dur ing the study to clarify any q uestions and to support 
compliance to the study. Any advers e event will be collected an d reported as per item 12 of 
this proposal. 
Visit 1:  At the first visit (screeni ng and baseline), the subjects will  be consented and will 
be screened by an exclusion/incl usion questionnaire, baseline l aboratory tests, 
electrocardiogram (EKG) and a pre gnancy test for females. A sto ol sample may be obtained,

 but it’s optional.  In addit ion, 10 mL of blood will be stored for research tests if the subject is 
eligible for the study, otherwise the blood/stool sample will b e discarded. The subject will 
have vital signs and Body Mass Index measured, and will undergo  a history and physical 
examination. If not excluded, t hey will be interviewed by a nut ritionist and will receive a diet 
and exercise assessment to determine their nutritional status ( using a 7-day food diary* or any 
other form of nutritional asse ssment). In addition, a brief phy sical examination will take place 
and a Cardio-Ankle Vascular Ind ex (CAVI) test may be performed.  Once eligibility is 
confirmed, subjects will be randomized, will receive a 10-week supply (at once or divided in 
refills) of the first  dietary supplement (CFO or LCMUFA capsule s), will be instructed to take 
4 capsules, 3 times a day, (total of 12 per day) after meals, f or 8 (or up to 10 weeks, if 
delayed) and will be schedule d to return for a second visit.  
Re-screening Visit as applicable:  Repeat laboratory values, in cluding baseline research 
blood, may be needed to reassess eligibility within 40 days of a screening failure.  If a subject 
is found ineligible, during or aft er the first visit, the 10 mL  of research blood will be 
discarded.  
Visit 2:  Eight weeks after initiating th e fish oil supplement (+ 2 weeks  if needed) the 
subjects will return for the ir second visit.  They will receive  laboratory tests and pregnancy 
testing for females. A stool s ample may be obtained, but it’s o ptional.  In addition, 10 mL of 
blood will be stored for research tests. The subject will have vital signs and Body Mass Index 
measured, will receive a diet and exercise assessment to determ ine their nutritional status, and 
a Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index ( CAVI) test may be performed. If necessary, a brief physical 
examination may be performed, a p ill count will also be perform ed to evaluate compliance. At 
the end of the 2nd visit, the subjects will be instructed to di scontinue any fish oil 
supplementation for 8 weeks (+ 2 weeks, if necessary), during t he wash-out period.       
Visit 3:   The third visit will occur 8 weeks (+ 2 weeks if needed) afte r visit #2 for a 2nd 
baseline measurement.  At this  visit, the subjects will receive  laboratory tests and pregnancy 
testing for females. A stool s ample may be obtained, but it’s o ptional. In addition, 10 mL of 
blood will be stored for research tests. The subject will have vital signs and Body Mass Index 
measured may receive a diet and exercise assessment to determin e their nutritional status, and 
a Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index ( CAVI) test may be performed. If necessary, a brief physical 
examination may be performed. At the end of the 3rd visit, subjects will receive a 10 week 
supply of the second dietary suppleme nt (CFO or LCMUFA capsules ) and will be instructed 
to take 4 capsules, 3 times a  day, after meals (total of 12 cap sules a day), for 8 weeks (+2 
weeks, if needed).  
Visit 4:   The fourth and final visit will  occur 8-10 weeks after starti ng the second fish oil 
supplementation.  Subjects will receive laboratory tests and a pregnancy testing for females. A

 stool sample may be obtained, but  it’s optional.  In addition, 10 mL of blood will be stored for 
research tests. The subject wi ll have vital signs and Body Mass  Index measured, may receive 
a diet and exercise assessment t o determine their nutritional s tatus, and a Cardio-Ankle 
Vascular Index (CAVI) test may be performed. If necessary, a br ief physical examination may 
be performed. A pill count will also be performed to evaluate c ompliance. At the end of the 4th 
visit, the subjects will be instructed to discontinue fish oil supplementation.   
*Subjects will be encouraged to complete the 7-day food record prior to the return visits, 
in order to facilitate  the nutritional and e xercise assessment.   However, if the subject does not 
complete, or only partially compl eted the seven day food record , the nutritional and exercise 
assessment will still take place and any dietary or life-style changes will be noted.

5. Supplements 
Supplements will be stored, dispensed and disposed (remaining c apsules) by the NIH CC 
pharmacy. The fish oil supplements  that will be studied will be  provided by Nippon Suisan 
Kaisha, Ltd. The supplements will be supplied as a liquid-fille d gel capsule for oral 
administration. Each capsule of t he control fish oil (CFO) cont ains at minimum 220 mg of 
omega-3 fatty acids, 400 mg of tot al MUFA, and 380 mg of oleic acid from the mixture of 
sardine fish oil and olive oil. Each capsule of LCMUFA-rich fis h oil (LCMUFA) contains at 
minimum 220 mg of omega-3 fa tty acid, 330 mg of total MUFA, and  240 mg of LCMUFA 
from saury fish oil.  
The participants will be instructed to take the supplements equ ivalent to a total of 
approximately 3g per day of omega -3 fatty acid, and 5g of total  MUFA in three divided doses 
(4 capsules, 3 times a day after meals in a total of 12 capsule s a day). The dosing is 
comparable with earlier c linical trials on fish oils21-25. They will also be advised to take the 
supplements after meals, as the y are better absorbed with fat.

7.  Data and Biospecimen Management Plan 
7.1 Data and Biospecimen Management 
  
Data Management and Access:  
The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into a password-protected electronic system 
that complies with NIH security standards and NHLBI DIR policy,  and for ensuring data accuracy, 
consistency and timeliness of entry. The PI, associate investig ators/research nurses and/or a contracted 
data manager may assist with the data management efforts. All h uman subjects personally identifiable 
information (PII), as defined in accordance to the Health Insur ance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA), eligibility and consent verification will be recorded in conformity with DIR policy. Primary 
and final analyzed data will h ave unique codes so that research  data can be attributed to an individual 
human subject participant. Coded data may be sent to associate investigators and collaborators outside 
of the NIH with IRB approval; local institutional approval may be required. Data with subject personal 
identifiers may be sent to associate investigators and collabor ators outside of the NIH only after 
approvals of both NHLBI and local IRBs or executed reliance agr eement with NHLBI’s IRB, or an 
extension of the NIH’s FWA thr ough an Individual Investigator A greement.

PI: Marcelo Amar, M.D. Date: May 2, 2019  
Version: 5.0 (Amendment D) 
  17 
  
Biospecimen Management:  Blood samples will be coded and stored in conformity with DIR P olicy (e.g., BSI). Coded 
biospecimens may only be sent t o collaborators o utside of the N IH after, IRB approval in 
accordance with applicable NIH a nd DIR Policy for sharing resea rch resources, including an 
executed material transfer agreement.   End of Study Procedures:  Data retained by the NHLBI will be  stored in a password-protect ed database in conformity 
with NHLBI DIR policy until the y are no longer of scientific va lue, as determined by the PI.  
 Breach of Confidentiality:  PI will report any breach of subj ect confidentiality or trial d ata to the clinical director and IRB 
per NIH policy, including NIH H RPP SOP 16 - Reporting Requireme nts for Unanticipated 
Problems, Adverse Events a nd Protocol Deviations. 
 7.2 Data Sharing and Future Use of Data   Data Sharing Plans:   Research data will not be share d with non-approved researchers.  If data sharing becomes 
necessary it may occur after I RB review and approval or a deter mination from the NIH 
OHSRP.  
 Future Use of Biospecimens:  Following the termination of the study, biospecimens will be de stroyed.  If any future research 
on biospecimens is intended, an IRB review and approval will be  submitted. 
 
8. Monitoring of Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal of 
Subjects   
8.1  Stopping Rules for Subjects 
 A single episode of severe gastro intestinal discomfort that in consultation with the 
physician is severe enough to di scontinue the protocol 
 Moderate gastrointestinal symptom s that persists for more than 5 consecutive days 
relating to the supplementation and as determined by contact wi th the investigator 
 Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
 Anaphylactic reaction due to cons umption of the fish oil supple ment 
17-H-0050: Effect of Fish Oil Enriched In Omega-11 Fatty Acid O n Lipoprotein Metabolism In Adults 
PI: Marcelo Amar, M.D. Date: May 2, 2019  
Version: 5.0 (Amendment D) 
  18 
  New onset atrial fibrillation/flutter 
 Major bleeding episode (CT CAE 4.0 grade III or IV) 
 Subjects taking irregular use of  fish oil capsules that in the opinion of the PI may 
compromise the data integrity. 
 Any other severe symptoms relate d to the study and as determine d by contact with the 
physician. 
 Subjects who are found to be pregna nt or wish to breastfeed dur ing the study will 
automatically be withdrawn. A pregnancy screening will be done for all female volunteers at 
the first visit and subjects will be excluded from the study if  pregnant.  It is not known 
whether the oils used in this study are secreted in breast milk . It is therefore  not advisable for 
any breastfeeding woman to partic ipate in this study. However, if a subject becomes pregnant 
during this study, monitoring of the  pregnancy will continue un til conclusion of the 
pregnancy.   
 Unlikely but possible adverse eff ects of omega-3 supplements ma y include atrial 
fibrillation (risk less th an one in a hundred persons).
 Patients that develop symptoms of atrial 
fibrillation (palpitations, rapi d heart rate, fai nting, shortne ss of breath, etc.) will be instructed 
to visit the emergency room and s eek treatment immediately.  In  order to prevent any future 
events, participants with atrial fibrillation will be withdrawn  from the study.  Individuals that 
develop an allergy to fish or she llfish may experience an anaph ylactic reaction from the 
supplement and will also be instructed to visit the emergency r oom immediately and will also 
be withdrawn from the study (ris k believed to be less than one in a thousand persons not 
known to have fish or s hellfish allergy).  
9. Analysis of the Study 
The primary outcome measures of this study will be  differences  between randomized 
groups in differences between tre atment periods in changes from  baseline to end of period in 
the plasma total cholesterol. S econdary outcome measurements wi ll be changes in proteomics, 
lipoprotein particle number, HDL  functional test (i.e. efflux s tudy) composition and size. Each 
subject will serve as their own control.  
9.1  Sample Size Determination  
Sample Size Determin ation and Methods 
 The study is designed to be a pilot trial to determine the effe ct size of the LCMUFA-rich 
fish oil supplement for a possibl e future larger clinical trial . The sample size requested in this 
study is based on our experience on o ther studies, such as the Omega-3 Fish Oil study. We are 
requesting to enroll up to 100 subj ects to obtain 20* evaluable  subjects that complete the 
whole study, and will perform an interim analysis after 10 subj ects have completed both arms 
in the study. The proteomic an alysis makes this study practical  and innovative. Based on the 
information gathered from othe r studies and on the NHLBI proteo mics core experience, the 
analysis of ten subjects is a re alistic number to meet our scie ntific goals. The interim analysis 
17-H-0050: Effect of Fish Oil Enriched In Omega-11 Fatty Acid O n Lipoprotein Metabolism In Adults 
PI: Marcelo Amar, M.D. Date: May 2, 2019  
Version: 5.0 (Amendment D) 
  19 
 will be performed only for proteomi c changes, and the magnitude  of proteomic change will 
result in the decision of study c ontinuation. This will allow u s to gather sufficient data to 
estimate changes that could justify a larger study. 
 
* evaluable subjects are subjects  that have compl eted the full time-line of the study (Figure 2) , have collected stool specime ns 
and thru the analysis of red cel l membrane omega-3 fatty acids (RCM) are found to have taken and absorbed the 
supplement.*   
9.2  Statistical Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be c alculated for all variables. A student’s t-test will be used to 
compare the difference in mean changes between the baseline and  the end of each arm period 
while accounting for period and group effects. Data of proteomi cs will be analyzed by paired 
student’s t-test to identify prot eins with statistically signif icant (p < 0.05) changes in 
normalized spectral counts, and an at least 1.3~1.5-fold will b e considered as a 
physiologically meaningful change  to continue the study. The st udy will be stopped if the 
changes are not statistically sig nificant or the changes is sma ller than 1.3-fold.   
10. Human Subject Protection 
10.1 Rationale for Subject Selection 
 
Subjects of all genders will be c onsidered for inclusion in thi s study.  There will be no 
racial, ethnic, or gender discri mination.  Cognitively impaired  and institutionalized persons 
will not participate in this s tudy.  Criteria for exclusion or withdrawal from the study are 
based on the presence of other dis ease processes that may inter fere with the interpretation of 
our results or situat ions that may be harmful to the health of subjects. 
10.2     Rationale for the Exclusion of Children 
Participant older than 18 will be considered for inclusion in t his study. There is not sufficient 
supporting data to establish nor mal levels, an upper limit or s afe intake of fish oil/omega-3 
fatty acids in children. 
10.3 Rationale for the Exclu sion of Pregnant Women  
Subjects must not be pregnant or a ctively seeking pregnancy in order to participate in this 
study. Pregnancy may introduce unp redictable effects on lipopro tein metabolism and 
influence the results of the s tudy. The specific effects of pre gnancy in this context may be the 
subject of a separate study. Som e form of contraception must be  used by subjects while 
enrolled. Contraception use will be determined by a questionnai re given to the subjects at time 
of enrollment.

  20 
 10.4 Rationale for the Exclusion  of Cognitively Impaired Subjec ts 
Cognitively impaired and institutionalized persons will not par ticipate in this study. 
Subjects must be able to provi de informed consent, and understa nd and comply with the 
supplement plan and follow-up.   
10.5 Inclusion of NIH Staff 
NIH staff (employees, NIH contractors, special volunteers, gues t researchers, and trainees) may 
voluntarily participate in this protocol.   
• If the individual requesting to part icipate in the protocol is a co-worker, the consent from the 
NIH staff member (co-worker) will not be obtained by the staff member’s direct supervisor 
but by another research staff me mber approved for obtaining inf ormed consent who is not a 
co-worker. 
• Recruitment, enrollment and compensation of NIH employee subjec ts will be consistent 
with the Guidelines for the Inc lusion of Staff in NIH Intramura l Research Studies (April 
2016) (SOP 14F, Appendix C) and NIH Policy Manual Chapter 2300- 630-3 and the Leave 
Policy for NIH Employees Partici pating in NIH Medical Research Studies. 
• Neither participation nor refusal t o participate as a subject i n this protocol will have an 
effect, either beneficial or adve rse, on the participant’s empl oyment or position at NIH.   
• The consenting staff member will make the NIH Information Sheet  on Staff Research 
Participation available to sta ff members who are considering en rolling in research. (SOP 
14F, Appendix C, Appendix A of the protocol) 
• Employee subjects’ privacy and conf identiality will be respecte d by protocol and consenting 
staff the same as for all subj ects participating in research pr otocols. However, all subjects 
will be made aware that there are limits to these protections. 
10.6    Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts 
Benefits:  
There are no direct benefits to the patient. However, omega-3 s upplements and omega-9 
supplements have been shown to decrease pro-atherogenic lipid l evels in several clinical 
trials.  Routine clinical labor atory testing and disclosure of results will be available to all 
subjects. Subjects are also ent itled to being notified of resul ts from the clinical cardio-ankle 
vascular measurement, if requested.  
 Risks/Benefit Analysis: 
As of May 2, 2019, this study is now c losed to new subject accr ual and continues in data 
analysis only and the level  of risk is minimal. 
 Risk (45 CFR 46.102 (h)(i)): The re search involves no more than  minimal risk to subjects and 
no prospect of direct benefit t o individual subjects, but likel y to yield generalizable 
knowledge about the condition or disorder under study.

  21 
 Sardine oil- or LCMUFA-rich fish oil, have minimum risk to subjects.  
Generally, adverse effects of fish oil supplements may include atrial fibrillation of new onset 
and increased propensity for bleed ing. Drug interactions may ex ist between individuals 
receiving Aspirin or cl opidogrel (Plavix). 
The most common side effects of  fish oil include taste perversi on, and eructation (belching).  
Participants will be notified of t hese effects in the informed consent document. Any subject 
exhibiting symptoms such as pa lpitations, rapid heart rate, or shortness of breath will 
instructed to go to the emergenc y room immediately and be withd rawn from the study. 
Individuals with an unknown alle rgy to fish or s hellfish not di sclosed at screening may 
experience an anaphylactic react ion, which will also be instruc ted to go immediately to an 
emergency room and will require withdrawal from the study.  In rare cases, fish oil 
supplement can trigger allergic  reactions. Symptoms may include  difficulty breathing, 
swelling of the face, fever, or flu -like symptoms and a skin ra sh.  Some studies reported 
consumption of omega-3-fatty aci ds is associated with a prolong ation of bleeding time. 
However, the prolongation of bleed ing time has not been shown t o surpass normal limits and 
did not result in clinically s ignificant bleeding episodes33,34. Any  patient currently treated with 
an anticoagulant will be e xcluded from this study.  
 Oleic acid-rich olive oil, commercially available olive oil supplements have minimum risk to 
subjects.  
 
Blood Draw: Subjects may feel lightheaded o r dizzy after having blood drawn .  There may be 
pain at the vein puncture site  and a slight risk of bruising.  To minimize this risk,  the routine 
blood-drawing protocol will be fo llowed and pressure will be ap plied to the area. 
 
The protocol will follow the NIH  Clinical Center MAS policy M95 -9 guidelines for limits 
of blood drawn for research purpose in the Clinical Center. For  adults, no more than 10.5 
mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is sma ller, will be drawn for resear ch purposes over any 8-week 
period. 
 Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI): Inflation of blood pressure cuffs may cause 
transient discomfort. Subjects w ith fragile skin may suffer min or trauma (as per ABIs, related 
to usual BP measurements). This procedure involves the use of a  VaSera VS-1500N system; 
an FDA approved vascular screening system. 
 EKG:  Up to 12 self-adhesive electrodes will be attached to the subj ect’s arms, legs and/or 
chest. Some skin irritation can occur where the electrodes are placed. Once the electrodes are 
placed, the test will begin. After  the test, the electrodes are  removed. The subject may have 
minor discomfort, similar to r emoving a bandage, when the elect rodes are removed. Rarely, a 
reaction to the electrode adhesive  may cause redness or swellin g where the patches were 
placed.

 10.7    Protocol Consent Processes and Documents 
Each subject will receive an oral  and written explanation of th e goals, procedures, and 
risks of this study.  The origina l, signed informed consent doc ument will be placed in the 
medical record, and the subject will receive a signed copy of t he informed consent document.  
A copy will also be placed in the s hadow chart.  A member of th e protocol team will be 
available to answer questions  about the study to be performed.   
 If there is an unexpected enrollm ent of a research participant for which there is no 
translated extant IRB approved c onsent document, the principal investigator and or those 
authorized to obtain informed consent will use the Short Form a nd Oral Consent Process as 
described in MAS Policy M77-2, NIH HRPP SOP 12, 45 CFR 46.117 ( b) (2), (If a study with 
an IND or IDE, also cite 21 CFR50. 27 (b) (a)). The summary that  will be used is the English 
version of the extant IRB approved consent document. 
 We request prospective IRB appr oval of the use of the short for m and oral consent process 
for up to a maximum of 5 particip ants in a given language and w ill report to the IRB at the 
time of continuing review of the  frequency of the use of the Sh ort Form.  Should we reach the 
threshold of 5 we will have that c onsent document translated in to the given inherent language 
and, we will seek individual I RB approval for any additional sh ort form needs pending the full 
translation of the IRB approved consent document. 
 
Participation of NIH Staff  
If the individual requesting to part icipate in the protocol is a co-worker, the consent from 
the NIH staff member (co-wor ker) will not be obtained by the re search coordinator or the 
employee’s direct supervisor but  by another research staff memb er who is approved for 
obtaining informed consent, and w ho is also not a coworker.

 12. Adverse Events, Devi ations, and Unanticipated 
Problem Reporting 
12.1 Adverse events (AE) 
 
Definition:   Adverse events (AE) are de fined by the FDA as any unfavorable  or 
unintended diagnosis, symptom , sign (including abnormal laborat ory finding), symptom or 
disease which either occurs dur ing the study, having been absen t at baseline, or if present at 
baseline, appears to worsen.  An une xpected adverse event is on e that is not described in the 
investigator protocol, published literature or the informed con sent document. 
 All AEs, regardless of severity, will be followed until satisfa ctory resolution. AEs should 
be reported by the subject up to 30 d ays following the last dos e of study drug.  
 Adverse events will be attributed (unrelated, unlikely, possibl y, probably or definitively) 
to study medication and/ or disease and AEs will be graded by s everity utilizing CTCAE 
version 4.0. A copy of the criteria can be downloaded at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDev elopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm . 
 
Reporting:  All adverse events occurring dur ing the study, including those observed by or 
reported to the research team, will be recorde d.   All adverse events will be reported to the 
IRB at the time of continuing review. 
 
Exceptions:  The following anticipated non ‐UP adverse events will not be reported to the 
IRB unless they occur at a rate  greater than (greater than 25% of the total n=70) and/or at a 
severity greater than (i.e. Gra de III higher) that known to occ ur in healthy volunteers:   
 Abdominal pain (Grade I & II) 
 Diarrhea (Grade I & II) 
 Eructation (Grade I & II) 
 Taste perversion (Grade I & II) 
 Acid-Reflux (Grade I & II) 
 Cough (Grade I & II) 
 Flatulence (Grade I & II) 
 Abdominal discomfort (Grade I & II) 
 Constipation (Grade I & II) 
 Increased PT/PTT  (Grade I & II) 
 An abnormal laboratory value or  changes from an abnormal baseli ne value will be 
considered an AE if the laborat ory abnormality is characterized  by any of the following: 
 Results in discontin uation from the study 
 Is associated with clini cal signs or symptoms  
 Requires treatment or any othe r therapeutic intervention

  Is judged by the Investigator to be  of significant clinical imp act 
 If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically sign ificant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action ta ken with respect to the test  drug and about the patient’s 
outcome. 
 Abnormal laboratory values not a ssociated with clinical symptom s will be evaluated but 
will not be considered an AE.  
 The laboratory results will be  monitored by healthcare professi onals and documented if 
clinically significant by th e MD or any AIs in the study.  
 
12.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
 Definition:   Serious adverse events (SAE ) are defined by the FDA as any un toward 
medical occurrences that result in death, are life-threatening,  require or prolong 
hospitalization, cause persistent  or significant disability or incapacity, result in congenital 
anomalies or birth defects, or a re other conditions which in th e opinion of the investigator 
represent significant hazards . All SAEs will be reported to the  Sponsor PI, Marcelo Amar, 
M.D.   
 Reporting:   SAEs that do not meet the criteri a of Unanticipated Problem ( UP) must be 
reported to the IRB Chair and C linical Directo r within 14 days of learning of the event using 
the NIH problem report form.  
 Pregnancy itself is not regarded a s an SAE unless there is susp icion that the 
investigational pr oduct under study may have interfered with th e effectiveness of a 
contraceptive medication. Any SAE s associated with pregnancy (e g, congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects/spontaneous miscarriages or any oth er serious events) must 
additionally be reported as suc h using the SAE report form. If pregnancy occurs during the 
course of this study an unanticip ated problem report will be su bmitted to the Clinical Director 
and the IRB.  
 Deaths possibly, probably, or defini tely related to the study a gent will be reported to the 
Clinical Director within 7 days a fter the PI first learns of th e event. 
 Any and all serious adverse events relating to the acquisition of blood samples, such as 
laceration, dissection, thrombos is of an artery, especially if those events cause injury to the 
hand requiring surgical correcti on, will be reported verbally a nd in writing to the Clinical 
Director of both the NHLBI and the  Clinical Center and the chai r of the IRB.  The verbal 
report will occur w ithin 48 hours of the o ccurrence.  The writt en report of the serious adverse 
event (e.g., death or life-threaten ing adverse event) will be r eported within 7 days.  For all

  25 
 other serious adverse events r elating to the acquisition of blo od samples,  the written report 
will be within 15 days. 
 
IND #: Pending 
 
IND Sponsor: Marcelo Amar, MD, NHLBI 
 
The PI will report SAEs to the Sponsor according to the require ments of 21 CFR 312.64(b) 
and as agreed upon with the sponsor . The Sponsor (or designee) will determine the 
reportability of the event to the  FDA and IND safety report wil l be submitted to the FDA as 
required as either an IND Safe ty Report or Annual report. 
  
IND Annual Report  A summary of all SAEs, nonserious AEs, and other events will be  recorded and submitted to 
the Sponsor and FDA in annual pr ogress reports (21 CFR 312.64(b )).  Annual progress 
reports will be submitted within 60 days after the anniversary date of the IND. 
 Events will be submitted to Dr. Marcelo Amar, IND Sponsor at: Marcelo Amar, M.D. 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Rm CRC 8N228, NHLBI  Bethesda, MD 20892 
 
12.3 Protocol Deviations (PD) 
 Definition:  Protocol Deviations are  any change, divergence, or  departure from the IRB 
approved research protocol. 
 A PD is serious if it meets the definition of a SAE (see sectio n 12.2) or if it compromises 
the safety, welfare or rig hts of subjects or others. 
 Reporting:  Serious PDs will be reported to t he IRB and Clinical Director a s soon as 
possible but not more than 7 days a fter the PI first learns of the event.  Not serious PDs will be 
reported to the IRB as soon as  possible but not more than 14 da ys after the PI first learns of 
the event.   
 
12.4 Unanticipated Problem (UP) 
 Definition:   An UP is any incident, experien ce, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria:

PI: Marcelo Amar, M.D. Date: May 2, 2019  
Version: 5.0 (Amendment D) 
  26 
 1. unexpected  in terms of nature, severit y, or frequency in relation to 
a. the research risks that are de scribed in the IRB-approved resea rch protocol and 
informed consent document; Invest igator’s Brochure or other stu dy documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the subj ect population be ing studied; an d 
2. related or possibly related  to participation in t he research; and 
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than w as previously known or recogniz ed. 
 Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event :  An unanticipated problem that does 
not fit the definition of an adve rse event, but which may, in t he opinion of the investigator, 
involves risk to the subject, aff ect others in the research stu dy, or significantly impact the 
integrity of research data.  For e xample, report occurrences of  breaches of confidentiality, 
accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted-for stu dy drug.  This may be a 
protocol deviation(s) a nd/or non-compliance. 
 Reporting:  Serious UPs will be reported to t he IRB and Clinical Director a s soon as 
possible but not more than 7 days a fter the PI first learns of the event.  Not serious UPs will be 
reported to the IRB and Clinical D irector as soon as possible b ut not more than 14 days after 
the PI first learns of the event.  
 If pregnancy occurs during the c ourse of this study an unantici pated problem report will 
be submitted to the Clinical Director and the IRB.  
13. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
Based on clinical trials, the omeg a-3 fish oil supplements have  been well tolerated and are 
unlikely to increase morbidity and mortality in subjects meetin g the inclusion criteria of the 
study. 
 
Protocol Monitoring   As per ICH-GCP 5.18 and 21 CFR 312.50 c linical protocols are re quired to be adequately 
monitored by the study sponsor. The  monitoring of this study wi ll be conducted by Clinical 
Research Associates (CRAs)/Monitors employed by an independent firm and working under 
an agreement with NHLBI to monitor aspects of the study in acco rdance with the appropriate 
regulations and the approved pr otocol. The objectives of a moni toring visit will be: 1) to 
verify the existence of signed i nformed consent form (ICF) and documentation of the ICF 
process for each monitored subj ect; 2) to verify the prompt and  accurate recording of all 
monitored data points, and prompt  reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare abstracted 
information with individual subj ects’ records and source docume nts (subject’s charts, 
laboratory analyses and test res ults, physicians’ progress note s, nurses’ notes, and any other 
relevant original subject infor mation); and 4) to help ensure i nvestigators are in compliance 
with the protocol. The monitors also will inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that 
regulatory requirements (Office fo r Human Research Protections- OHRP), FDA and 
applicable guidelines (ICH-GCP)  are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the

  27 
 investigator (and/or design ee) and other study personnel will b e available to discuss the study 
progress and monitoring visit.  
The investigator (and/or desi gnee) will make study documents (e .g., consent forms and 
pertinent hospital or clinical r ecords readily ava ilable for in spection by the lo cal IRB, the 
FDA, the site monitors, and the NHLBI staff for confirmation of  the study data  
 Safety Monitoring 
Principal Investigator: Accrual and safety data will be monitor ed by the PI.  The protocol 
will be continuously evaluated f or any unusual or unpredicted c omplications with the aim of 
detecting and preventing unacceptable increase in morbidity and  mortality over and above that 
anticipated from niacin. 
NHLBI IRB 
Accrual and safety data will be monitored and reviewed annually  by the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB).  Prior to implementation of this study, the  protocol and the proposed 
patient informed consent document will be reviewed and approved  by the properly constituted 
IRB operating according to the 45 CFR 46 Code of Federal regula tions.  This committee must 
approve all amendments to the pro tocol or informed consent docu ment, and conduct 
continuing annual review so long as the protocol is open to acc rual or follow up of subjects. 
FDA : An annual progress report, any a mendments to the protocol, an d any change in the 
status of the protocol will be f orwarded to the FDA in complian ce with 21CFR 312.33

 16. APPENDIX A: NIH INFORMATION SHEET ON STAFF 
RESEARCH PARTICIPATION (April 2016) 
As an NIH employee, contractor, Special Volunteer, Guest Resear cher, or trainee, you may 
participate in intramural research studies unless it is prohibi ted by your Institute or Center (IC), or if 
you are excluded by the criteria of the protocol in which you w ant to enroll. The inclusion of NIH 
staff in a particular protocol must also be approved by the IRB . You may be motivated by altruism, a 
commitment to research in your own or related fields, or want a ccess to clinical trials of potential 
direct therapeutic benefit. When deciding, you should make an i nformed decision about 
participation. This information sheet offers some points to con sider for NIH staff who are 
considering research participation at NIH.  
First, similar to any individual who is considering research pa rticipation, you should seek adequate 
information about the study pur pose, what is required of you in  terms of procedures, interventions and 
time, and the potential risks and benefits of participation. Fo r more information, see the NIH Clinical 
Center’s public website “Are Clinical Studies for You?” at http://www.cc.nih.gov/participate/studies.shtml .  
When you are thinking about par ticipation in a research study t hat is being conducted by your 
supervisor, or others with whom you work closely in your labora tory, branch, or unit, you should 
consider some additional factors:  
A. Possible bias : Are you confident that you can be unbiased about reporting an swers, side effects, or 
other information that could influence the study outcome or ris k to you?  
B. Confidentiality : Has the principal investigator (PI) spoken about what informa tion will be 
collected from you as part of th e study? Has the PI discussed w hat information will be available to 
those within, and outside, the study team? If applicable, are y ou comfortable sharing your medical 
history (including, for example , mental health history or STDs)  and your social history (e.g. substance 
use) with study investigators who may be your coworkers, or wit h the possibility of them discovering 
something about your health during the study (e.g. pregnancy st atus or a new diagnosis)? Although 
every effort will be made to pro tect your information and keep it private and confidential, your 
information may, depending on the nature of the protocol, becom e available in medical records or to 
authorized users outside of the study team. Discuss any concern s with the PI. 
 
C. Pressure : Do you perceive any pressure o r expectations from your superv isor or colleagues 
regarding participa tion? Could that pressure influence your dec ision or make it difficult for you to 
choose whether or not to participate? Remember that it is your choice whether or not to participate 
and that your decision to participate or not should not have an  effect, either beneficial or adverse, 
on your position at NIH.  
D. Time and Compensation : Can you take time off from work to complete the study require ments 
or participate solely during non- duty hours? Can you receive co mpensation for your participation in 
this study? Will your supervisor give you permission to partici pate during work hours? See the NIH 
Policy Manual 2300630-3 Leave Policy for NIH Employees Partic ipating in NIH Medical Research 
Studies .

  33 
 E. Consent Process: Is the person obtaining your consent for the study your supervi sor, a subordinate, 
or co-worker? If so, is there an independent person monitoring the consent process? If the study PI is a 
supervisor and intends to obtain  consent from you, an independe nt person (e.g., through Bioethics or 
the NIMH Human Subjects Protections Unit [HSPU], or others as a pproved by the IRB) must monitor 
the consent process. If the person obtaining consent from you i s a co-worker then an independent 
person (e.g., through Bioethics or  the NIMH HSPU, or others as approved by the IRB) may be 
required to monitor the consent process, as determined by the I RB for the specific study.  
If you are thinking of enrolling as a subject at the NIH Clinic al Center and you have any questions or 
concerns, please contact the Office of Human Subjects Research Protections (OHSRP) at 301-402-
3444 and/ or the Patient Represen tative if you are thinking of enrolling as a subject at the NIH Clinical 
Center on 301-496-2626. If you are at a NIH site outside the Cl inical Center then please contact local 
site leadership.

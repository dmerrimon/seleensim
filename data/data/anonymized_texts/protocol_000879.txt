Study Design: This is a first -in-human (FIH), Phase 1, single -center, prospective, randomized, double -blind 
study of ascending single doses of CD388 Injection administered IM or SQ to healthy adult subjects followed by another single dose of  CD388 Injection administered by the same route 3 months or 5 effective half -lives , 
whichever is longer , after the first dose in the middle and  high dose groups (dosing may be adjusted for 
tolerability) . The goals are  to assess safety, tolerability, immunogenicity  (anti- drug antibodies [ ADA]) , and PK 
of CD388.  
Dose levels of CD388 to be assessed will follow an ascending single dose design with the starting dose based on 
findings from 3 -month rat and  monkey toxicology studies. Within each route (IM and SQ dose, route assignment 
is unblinded), subjects will be ran domized to receive a single dose of CD388 Injection or saline placebo 
(treatment assignment is blinded)  according to the design  in the table below . It should be noted that each cohort 
will be divided into 2 groups identified as “sentinel” groups (randomized 1:1) and “main” groups  (randomized 
7:2):  
• Low dose (50 mg) level: Cohort 1A (IM) and Cohort 1B (SQ) – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• Mid dose (150 mg) level: Cohort 2A (IM) and Cohort 2B (SQ) – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• High dose (450 mg) level: Cohort 3A (IM) and Cohort 3B (SQ) – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• H
ighest  dose ( 900 mg) level: Cohort 4B (SQ) – n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
For each route, the sentinel or first group of 2 subjects (1 CD388: 1 placebo) at  a dose level  will be administered 
blinded study drug and closely monitored for safety for at least 1 week. The Principal Investigator (PI) 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.  Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential Page 5 of 85 and Sponsor will review blinded safety data after the initial sentinel group subjects at a  dose level have completed 
dosing and followed for a minimum of 1 week. If no drug- related SAEs or  drug-related Grade ≥3 AEs have 
occurred, the subjects in the corresponding main group may be dosed within 24  hours . The observation duration 
may be adjusted for the sentinel groups in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4B  based on data from previous cohorts . 
After all subjects at a dose l evel (for the IM cohorts and SQ cohorts separately) have completed study drug 
administration and have undergone protocol -specified procedures and  assessments for ≥14  days, the PI 
and Sponsor will review blinded safety data, including AEs  (including reactogenicity/injection site reactions 
and hypersensitivity reactions ), vital signs, 12- lead ECG s, and clinical laboratory  results  (including hematology, 
coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis)  to determine the safety and tolerability of the study drug. 
The incidence and severity of AEs, and adverse changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, and ECGs 
will be taken in to consideration when determining safety and tolerability of study drug. Escalation between dose 
levels will be based on review of at least 14 -day post -dose safety data. If  the dose/route  of administration  is 
determined to be safe and well tolerated ≥14 da ys after dosing, the next cohort of subjects will be enroll ed 
and randomized to receive the next higher dose level of CD388 Injection or placebo. The  data cut -off time point 
for data review and dose escalation decision has been adjusted for Cohorts  2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B based on data 
from Cohort s 1A and 1B .

Note: Immediately prior to  the second single dose, within each dose and route, any dropouts  in the sentinel groups will be 
randomly replaced with subjects from the main groups, retaining their original treatment assignment (i.e., subjects 
assigned to placebo will remain placebo, and subjects assigned to CD388 will remain CD388) . 
Subjects in Cohorts 1A, 1B , and 4B will receive a single dose of CD388 or placebo.  
Subjects in Cohorts 2A and 2B and Cohorts 3A and 3B will receive a second single dose of CD388 Injection 
or placebo after washout of 3 months or  5 effective half -lives, whichever is longer , after the first dose if it is 
determined that the safety and tolerability of the first dose is acceptable upon review of the cumulative safety 
data. Immediately prior to the sec ond single dose, within each dose and route, any dropouts  in the sentinel groups 
will be randomly replaced with subjects from the main groups, retaining their original treatment assignment (i.e., subjects assigned to placebo will remain placebo, and subjects assigned to CD388 will remain CD388; this 
may require unblinded personnel to oversee).   
The PI and Sponsor will review blinded safety data after the initial sentinel group subjects at a  dose level have 
completed dosing and followed for the minimum observation period as determined during the first single dose . If 
no drug- related SAEs or  drug r elated Grade ≥3 AEs have occurred, the subjects in the corresponding main group 
may be dosed within 24 hours.  
The dose escalation scheme is presented  in Section  1.2.

(second single dose, Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B) , and Table  3 (single dose, Cohort 4B) . All subjects will be 
admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) for observation and safety assessments from Day - 1 (check -in) 
to Day 30.  
Subjects will be monitored for AEs (including reactogenicity/injection site reactions  and hypersensitivity 
reactions ) and SAEs as indicated below:  
Cohort  AE/SAE monitoring period from signing of ICF:  
1A, 1B  Through 4 months after the dose of study drug 
2A, 2B , 3A, 3B , 4B Through 205 days  after the last dose of study drug (Day 206 ±10 days)  
Abbreviation: ICF  = informed consent form.  
Safety will also be assessed by physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs measurements, and laboratory 
evaluations (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) at  various time points during and after the 
CRU stay. Concomitant medication use will be recorded throughout the study.  
Continuous 12 -lead digital ECG recording will be performed using a  12-lead Holter ECG monitor as indicated 
below: 
Cohort  Holter Monitoring Period  
1A, 1B  1 hour before administration of study drug until 48 hours after dosing 
2A, 2B, 3B  1 hour before first administration of study drug until 48 hours after dosing a 
3A Predose from 1 hour before administration of first single dose until 
administration is complete, and from 72 to 120 hours after dosing a 
4B Predose from 1 hour before administration  of single dose until administration 
is complete , and from 72 to 120 hours after dosing
Note: Timing  of ECG monitoring has been adjusted for Cohort 3A and 4B based on PK and ECG data . 
a.Performed at the second administration period only if required to further evaluate observations from
prior peri -dosing period (at the discretion of the Investigator).
Blood PK samples, and blood samples to assess ADA will be collected from all subjects for the purpose of 
maintaining the blind, but only samples from the CD388 Injection group will be analyzed (using validated assays) by an unblinded central bioanalytical laboratory. After discharge from the CRU, additional sample collection for 
PK and ADA will be performed at specified time points after dosing. The timing  of PK sampling has been 
adjusted for Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B  based on data from previous cohorts .
 
Additional blood samples will be collected for pharmacogenomics and exploratory biomarker evaluation, 
and additional blood and urine samples will be collected for exploratory metabolite identification, to be reported 
separately. Plasma samples collected for  PK analysis may also be used for CD388 drug- antibody ratio (DAR) 
distribution and metabolite identification after completion of PK analysis. Nasopharyngeal swabs  will also be 
collected for CD388 exploratory assays. Nasal wash collection will occur during the second single dose at the 
time of C max as determined from the first single dose.  Nasal wash collection for Cohort 4B will occur during 
dosing on Day 7.

Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration  
CD388 Injection is a clear to lightly opalescent liquid essentially free of particulate matter containing the active 
pharmaceutical ingredient, CD388. CD388 Injection is supplied as a frozen sterile solution in single -use vials.  
CD388 Injection is administered by either intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SQ) injection at the dose described in Table  5, depending upon the subject’s randomization assignment. Dose levels to be assessed will 
follow an  ascending single -dose regimen with the starting dose based on findings from 3- month rat and monkey 
toxicology studies.  
Comparator  
Normal saline will be administered IM or SQ as the placebo control.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 9 of 85 Duration of Treatment  
A single dose of study drug will be administered IM or SQ on Day 1. Study participation will require up to 
28 days for screening procedures, and ~ 120 days for the first single dose (check- in to the CRU on Day - 1; CRU 
inpatient stay for study drug administration, observation, and assessments and procedures for 31 days [Days - 1 
to Day 30]; and 4 CRU outpatient visits for additional assessments and procedures).  
Subjects in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B who receive a second single dose will have an additional 168  days of 
participation, with similar study visits  to that of the first administration . 
Criteria for Evaluation  
Safety and Tolerability of Study Drug  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs  (including reactogenicity/injection site reactions , 
hypersensitivity reactions,  and adverse events of special interest [AESIs] ), vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs, Holter 
monitoring, clinical laboratory results (including hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), 
and concomitant medication usage throughout the study.   
See the Study Design sectio n for details regarding dose level/cohort enrollment timing  and assessment  of safety 
and tolerability for  dose escalation decision . 
If a dose level is considered not safe or  well tolerated, the  study drug assignment for the subject(s) with the safety 
issue  may be unblinded. The Sponsor may also independently decide to unblind the entire cohort for safety 
concerns or  terminate enrollment for any reason.  
If any subject develops a Grade ≥2 AE  that is deemed related to the study drug, the mechanism of the AE may 
be assessed  (i.e., cytokine level, complement activation, immunoglobulin G [IgG ] subtypes, immunoglobulin E 
[IgE], T-cell/B -cell/monocyte and  basophil activation as assessed by flow cytometry, ADA development, 
and immune complex formation) at Sponsor a nd Investigator discretion , and the study dose and route may be 
modified for the remainder of the study.  
Pharmacokinetics/Anti -drug Antibodies  
Pharmacokinetics will be determined by analyzing plasma samples for concentration of CD388 obtained from subjects  who receive CD388 Injection in each cohort at various time points after administration of  the first 
and second single doses of the study drug. Blood samples collected for PK analysis may also be used for 
metabolite identification after completion of PK an alysis , along with urine samples . Plasma  samples , 
nasopharyngeal swabs , and nasal washes  will be analyzed for the concentration of CD388. Anti -drug antibodies 
(ADA) will also be measured at selected time points by a validated ELISA method.  
Pharmacogenomics  
A mandatory pharmacogenomic (DNA) blood sample will be collected once, preferably on Day 1 (collection at another time point is allowed if necessary) to allow for genetic research to help understand the characteristics of 
CD388. Genetic analysis will be co nducted if it is hypothesized that this may help explore genetic markers that 
could explain differences in safety, immunogenicity, or clinical response among subjects . Host DNA assessment 
will be limited to research related to CD388. They  may also be used to develop tests/assays related to CD388 
and flu-like disease.  
Analyses of host DNA may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately from the study report . 
Exploratory Biomarkers  
Blood samples will be collected to allow for the exploration of biomarkers (such as but not limited to RNA 
or proteins) on the assumption that these markers may play a role in the response  (safety, reactogenicity, 
immunogenicity ) to CD388.  
These samples and r emaining material from other samples may be used for further assay 
optimization/qualification, biomarkers, or  further exploratory analyses. Samples will only be used for research 
related to influenza virus infection, flu -like disease, and safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CD388. 
They may also  be used to develop tests/assays related to CD388 and influenza . 
Analyses of biomarkers may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately from the study report .

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 10 of 85 Withdrawal from Study  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for  any of t he following reasons : 
• Subject is unable or unwilling to continue  
• Subject elects to withdraw informed consent  
• Adverse event (whether or not related to study drug) that precludes further participation in the study in 
the judgment of an  Investigator and/or Sponsor  
• Protocol non- compliance  
• Subject lost to follow -up, or follow -up is not possible  
• The Investigator  considers that it is in the subject’s best interest not to continue participation in  the study 
Subject Stopping Rules  
Additionally, subjects in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B will be followed through Outpatient Visit 4 (OV4)  of the 
first dosing period, and will not receive the second single dose:  
• If the subject develops anaphylaxis  or a related Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE  
• If the subject has a persistent (i.e., >5 days with no response to treatment) Grade ≥ 2 rash considered 
related to the investigational drug by the Principal Investigator (Appendix 4 ) 
• If the Investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the subject to not receive a second dose.  
• If the subject no longer meets all eligibility criteria prior to the second single do se 
• If the subject becomes pregnant prior to the second single dose  
If a subject is removed from the study for any reason, the subject will be followed for resolution of any ongoing 
AE(s). 
Temporary Study Halt for Safety Review  
The study will be temporarily  halted, pending review of available data, if any of the following occur:   
• If ≥2 subjects experience the same Grade 3 AE event or laboratory abnormality within 28 days after 
study drug administration, considered attributable to CD388 or cannot be attributed to another cause  
(Investigator to consider the potential of IM injections to cause significant transient increases of creatine 
kinase [ CK], when evaluating the potential relatedness of this laboratory abnormality to the 
investigational drug. A  transient CK increase after IM injection is to be considered “ not related ” to the 
study drug.)  
• If ≥1 subject experiences a Grade 4 AE or laboratory abnormality within 28 days after study drug 
administration, considered attributable to CD388 or cannot be attributed to another cause  
If it is considered appropriate to restart the study following an internal safety review, a substantial amendment 
will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institutional Review Board (IRB). The study 
will not restart until the amendment has been approved by the FDA and IRB.  
Statistical Methods  
Safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. There will be no formal hypothesis testing. Analysis populations are:  
• Safety Population: all subjects who receive any amount of study drug  
• PK Analysis Population: all subjects who receive CD388 Injection and who have any blood samples analyzed  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before unblinding  for th e first interim analysis . 
Any deviations from the final SAP will be described and justified in the study report. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
®. 
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables,  and the numbers, means, 
standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables, will be provided. All data will 
be summarized separately by dose level , route (IM or SQ), and study drug (CD388 Injection or placebo) . Listings 
of individual subject data will also be produced.

CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 11 of 85 Safety will be evaluated by presenting summaries of A Es and SAEs , ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis ), and vital signs. Adverse events will be coded using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence of TEAEs and AESIs will be 
presented by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT), relationship to study drug, severity, and r oute 
of administration .   
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as follows:  
Cohort  TEAE is an AE  that occurs during or after study drug administration:  
1A, 1B  Through 4 months after the dose of study drug  
2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4B  Through 205 days  after the last dose of study drug (Day 206 ±10 days)  
In addition,  the incidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug or from the 
study will be presented by SOC and  PT. The TEAEs occurring after the first single dose and after the second 
single dose will be analyzed separately. Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory test results , ECG parameters , 
and vital signs, and for changes from Baseline, will be presented by time point. The incidences of potentially clinically significant (PCS) clinical laboratory results , ECG parameters , and vital signs will also be summarized 
by time point.  
A summary of the injection site evaluation will be presented. The number and percentage of subjects with any 
local reaction will be provided , as will the number and percentage of subjects with pain, tenderness , 
erythema/redness , and induration/swelling. The severity of each local reaction will also be presented.  
The PK parameters t hat will be assessed in the PK Analysis Population include:  
• maximum plasma concentration (C
max) 
• time to maximum plasma concentration (T max) 
• terminal elimination half -life (t ½) 
• apparent clearance (CL/F) 
• apparent volume of distribution (V Z/F)  
• area under the plasma concentration- time curve from time 0 to time of last quantifiable sample (AUC 0-t) 
• area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞)  
CD388 concentration  in the upper respiratory tract as determine d from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collection  
will be summarized  and reported separately . 
Analysis of the ADA results is to be determined  and may include determination of the subject’s positive/negative 
ADA status at baseline, treatment -emergent ADA in subje cts with a negative baseline, as well as a post -baseline 
increase in titer for subjects with positive ADA at baseline . 
Metabolite identification and profiling, CD388 in urine and nasal wash, CD388 DAR distribution, CD388 
glycoforms, pharmacogenomics, and exploratory biomarkers will be reported separately.  
Two blinded interim analyses  of selected safety and PK data, one for the first dose level and another one for the 
second dose level , are planned for internal decision making or health authority interaction.

Schedule of Events: Single Dose, Cohort  4B 
a. For subjects who discontinue study early, the Day 206 procedures should be performed.  
b. On Day 1, the targeted physical examination should be performed predose. Vital signs collection will occur predose, 6 hours postdose, and as clinically 
indicated.  
c. 12-lead ECG is to be performed at screening, at CRU check -in on Day - 1, predose (immediately prior to study drug administration) and 6 hours postdose 
(±10 minutes) on Day 1, and as indicated in the Schedule. Subjects are to be resting and semi -recumbent when ECG is being conducted.  
d. Continuous 12 -lead digital ECG recording will be performed using a 12- lead Holter ECG monitor. Pharmacodynamic ECG tracings, including all 12- leads 
and of 10 seconds duration, will be extracted in triplicate for 5 -minute observation period starting from 1 hour before dosing, then at 72, 76, 80, 84, 96, 102, 
106, 110, 118, and 120 hours after administration of study drug, and stored in a digital format. The Holter monitor will be removed on Day 6. The Holter 
monitor may be removed once on Day 5 for up to 15 minutes for shower/bathing, at least 1 hour away from the next ECG timepoint . 
e. Laboratory evaluations need to be performed once during the Day 3– 6 interval.  
f. Performed at screening, and as clinically indicated (e.g., if the Investigator has concerns regarding an SAE, anti -drug antibody reaction in a subject with 
hypersensitivity reaction, fever, serious rash, joint/bone pain, cough, proteinuria, or clinically meaningful changes in the white cell differential or liver 
function tests).  
g. A sensitive serum pregna ncy test (β‑human chorionic gonadotropin) is required at screening and OV4 for females of childbearing potential. 
FSH (if applicable to confirm postmenopausal status) is only required once. Urine pregnancy test may be performed at all other time p oints.  
h. Drug and alcohol screen is to be performed during the outpatient visits if vital signs are abnormal (see Appendix  2). 
i. At indicated visits, inspection of administration site and surrounding area will be performed twice daily (once between appro ximately 2 –4 hours postdose, 
and once approximately 8– 12 hours postdose), with any abnormal findings reported as AEs. Reactions will be rated according to the scale provided in 
Table  7.

72, 84, 96, 108, 120 hours (each ±2 hour window); and Days 7, 9, 11, 14, 21, 30 (each ±2 hour window). Postdose samples collected at outpatient CRU visits 
at Days 45, 84, 126, 168, and 206 have the same windows (i.e., in ±days) as the visits . 
k. Blood samples for metabolite identification (e.g., free zanamivir, zanamivir dimers) will be collected on Day 1 at 2 h ours postdose, on Day 2 at 24 hours 
postdose, on Day 30, Day 84, and on Day 126 . Urine samples for  metabolite identification will be collected from 0 –48 hours, from 48– 96 hours, and from 
96–144 hours postdose, and over a 24 hour period on Days  10, 14, and 21, and over a 24- hour period that starts on Day 29 and ends prior to CRU check- out 
on Day 30. 
l. Serum samples for CD388 glycoforms will be collected predose on Day 1 and once in the morning on Days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 30, a nd at the Day 45 and 
Day 126 visits.  
m. A mandatory pharmacogenomic (DNA) blood sample will be collected once, preferably on Day 1 (collection at another time point is allowed if necessary) to allow for pharmacogenomic research related to CD388.  
n. Nasopharyngeal swab samples will be col lected predose on Day 1, and on Days 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21, and 30. Nasal wash collection will occur on Day 7. 
o. Adverse events (including influenza -like illness which will be tested for both COVID -19 and flu) will be collected for all subjects from the tim e of signing 
the ICF through 205 days after the dose of study drug (Day 206 ±10 days)  (this final AE assessment will be conducted via a follow -up phone call to the 
subject).  
p. Concomitant procedures used to treat an AE will be recorded from the time of CD388 Injection/placebo administration until the final study visit.

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 28 of 85 4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
4.1. Background  
4.1.1. Influenza – Prevention and Treatment  
Globally, millions are hospitalized each year and about 650,000 deaths occur due to influenza 
(Iuliano 2018) . In the United States ( US), an estimated 37 –43 million influenza- related illnesses, 
17– 20 million influenza-related medical visits, 500,000 to 650,000 influenza- related 
hospitalizations, and 61,000 deaths occurred during the 2018–2019 influenza season (Brammer  2019). These numbers remain high year after year becaus e currently no effective 
medicine is available for the  prevention of influenza. 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the administration of an influenza vaccine yearly for the prevention of influenza, but the efficacy varies yearly due to 
the emergence of new strains. According to the CDC, during the 2018–2019 influenza season, the vaccine was only 29% effective ( Flannery  2019). Vaccines cannot offer complete protection 
because of high genetic diversity between and within influenza A and B types. Additionally, 
rapid antigenic drift and antigenic shift in the virus erodes vaccine durability (necessitating 
development of new vaccines annually), and slow vaccine manufacturing cycles make it difficult to keep pace with constantly mutating seasonal and pandemic viral strains. 
The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir are approved for 
prophylaxis and treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Use of NAI antiviral prophylaxis is recommended to control institutional outbreaks of influenza when used within 48 hours after 
exposure in individuals who are not vaccinated or who are unlikely to respond to influenza 
vaccines and are immunosuppressed or have co-morbidities that predispose them to severe influenza illness. However, when NAIs are used for prophylaxis, even when used promptly 
after a known exposure, the efficacy is only around 70–80% and prolonged use in 
immunocompromised individuals can lead to the emergence of NAI drug resistance 
(Okoli 2014). 
Over the past 20 years there has been increasing concern that highly pathogenic avian strains such as H7N9 and H7N7 can be transmitted to humans causing high fatality rates in a manner similar to that of the H5N1 pandemic strain in 1997. Although the transmission of these avian 
strains to humans has been largely limited to  individuals exposed to poultry, the possibility of 
the emergence of a highly pathogenic and human-adapted influenza variant is concerning 
(Paules  2017). Furthermore, recent modeling predicts that, in the event of a pandemic event 
along the lines of the 1918 Spanish flu, 33 million people would die in the first 6 months before a vaccine could be developed and many millions more would die during the time it would take for the global population to be immunized ( Abbasi 2019). 
Progress towards a medicinal agent that provides protection against a broad range of influenza strains with a longer duration of protection, otherwise known as a “universal vaccine”, has been disappointing. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics developed to date have suffered 
from limited spectrum and commercial limitations due to high dosing requirements  and/or 
the need for multiple antibody cocktails to achieve a desired spectrum and efficacy. Thus, 
a significant unmet need exists for long-acting universal protective agents.

CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 29 of 85 4.1.2. CD388 – A Long -Acting Antiviral Fc -Conjugate 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Cidara) is developing a novel therapeutic and prophylactic agent that 
has a potential to provide durable single- dose “universal” coverage per flu  season. Cidara has 
replaced variable domains of a monoclonal antibody with multiple copies of a highly potent 
small molecule antiviral agent ( the marketed NAI zanamivir) tailored to target a small, highly  
conserved essential influenza target. This  molecule, CD388, is a first in class long -acting  
antiviral Fc -conjugate (AVC) combining a surface -acting antiviral agent with  the crystallizable 
fragment ( Fc) of a human immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) antibody. 
CD388 differs from traditional antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) molecules in the following aspects:  
• In traditional antibody-drug conjugates the drug is attached to full length human IgG (Fc + antigen -binding fragment [ Fab]); in contrast, zanamivir dimers of CD388 are 
conjugated to an Fc fragment of human IgG1 (and not full length IgG1). 
• In traditional antibody-drug conjugates the drug is conjugated to the human IgG using a protease- cleavable linker to allow release of the drug inside target cells;  the linker 
between zanamivir and the Fc in CD388 is not a substrate for proteases, and it exerts its 
antiviral activity in the extracellular space.  
• Traditional antibody-drug conjugates are used to treat cancer by delivering  cytotoxic 
payloads to target cells with rapid release; CD388 is designed to treat and prevent infectious disease using a long-acting stable conjugate of a non- cytotoxic small molecule 
to an Fc fragment of IgG1 
In nonclinical in vitro and in vivo models, CD388 has demonstrated the potential for 
significantly higher antiviral activity and efficacy compared to the parent molecule, zanamivir, as well as other NAIs , including oseltamivir.  
4.1.2.1. CD388 Nonclinical Studies  
Several in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD388 and/or related Fc-conjugated prototype targeting molecule s (TMs) to 
support dosing in humans. In vitro NAI and cell- based assays were conducted with CD388 to 
assess its spectrum and potency against Wild Type (WT) as well as drug -resistant influenza 
strains. In vitro studies to characterize the extent of neonatal crystallizable fragment receptor (FcRn ) and Fc- γ receptor binding across different species were conducted. In vitro studies to 
characterize the potential for resistance development with CD388 have been undertaken. In vivo efficacy of CD388 was observed in treatment, and prophylaxis or preventative mouse lethal infection models. 
In vitro stability of the TM compound alone was quantitatively tested at 37℃  in phosphate-
buffered saline, plasma, and liver microsomes. Stability of the intact Fc-conjugated molecule, 
CD388, was qualitatively observed in liver microsomes at 37℃ . In vivo, th e pharmacokinetics 
were investigated in animal species that were used to characterize the pharmacological 
and toxicological profile of CD388 and related molecules; namely in mouse, rat, and monkey. 
More  importantly, following pharmacokinetic studies in the mouse, rat, and monkey, plasma 
concentrations were quantified by a neuraminidase (NA)- capture or Fc- capture with Fc detection 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 30 of 85 enzyme-linked immunoassay ( ELISA ) methods, to confirm the stability of CD388 in vivo. 
NA-capture/Fc- detection measures the concen tration of intact NA-linked- Fc species while 
Fc-capture/Fc -detection measures the total concentration of Fc- related species. Plasma 
concentrations measured by both methods were comparable, suggesting that intact CD388 
remained stable in vivo as designed. 
Single-dose, range-finding intramuscular ( IM) and/or subcutaneous ( SQ) toxicity 
and toxicokinetic studies, with endpoint evaluations occurring over the plasma exposure 
periods of 4 weeks in rats and 6 weeks in monkeys, have been conducted. The pivotal Good 
Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) toxicity studies include endpoints to assess safety pharmacology 
(i.e., cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurobehavioral effects) and toxicokinetics to determine 
safety margins. In addition, screening for anti-CD388 antibodies, cytokine analysis, 
and immunophenotyping have been performed. These pivotal GLP nonclinical studies 
supporting first -in-human ( FIH) studies were designed in accordance with the relevant 
International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) guidance and US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) guidance on safety and toxicology studies for CD388’s predecessor molecule (CD377). 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional nonclinical information. 
4.2. Summary of Benefits and Risks  
This is a FIH  study of CD388 Injection. More detailed information about the known 
and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events ( AEs) may be found in 
the Investigator’s Brochure. 
The risks for the individual subject due to administration of CD388 Injection are consi dered low 
and are outweighed by the potential to develop a new treatment in an area of high unmet medical 
need. To further minimize any potential risk, all subjects will be closely screened for any 
underlying conditions that may increase risk of study participation. During the conduct of the 
study, subjects are housed in a clinical research unit (CRU) for 30 days after CD388 Injection/placebo administration, under continuous medical supervision.  
4.3. Justification of Dose  
The dose(s) planned for this  study are based on results obtained from GLP 3-month exposure 
toxicology studies in rats and primates, and the FDA’s guidance contained in “ Estimating the 
Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers ” (FDA  2005). 
From the 3-month GLP toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, a no-observed-adverse- effect 
level ( NOAEL ) of 500 mg/kg has been established for both species. CD388 safety margins 
generated from these pivotal 3-month exposure studies in support of the FIH proposed dose are 
presented in Table 4. At the proposed 50 mg human dose administered as a bolus IM or SQ  
injection, the safety margin based on the 3-month NOAELs and using body surface area ( BSA ) 
is 97-fold in rats and 194-fold in monkeys. Safety margins based on human area under the 
plasma concentration -time c urve ( AUC ) predictions at 50 mg relative to the rat and monkey 
3-month plasma AUC exposures are 166-fold in rats and 581-fold in monkeys.

f. Predicted human plasma PK for 50 mg starting dose (or 0.833 mg/kg based on a 60 kg person): AUC 0-∞ = 3855 µg×h/mL. 
Cmax = 14.4 µg/mL  (calculated from 5 mg/kg IV human PK as reported/projected in NC -CD388 -05). Note: These 
exposures were predicted for IV administration and would represent the highest values  expected as bioavailability from IM 
or SQ administration is anticipated to be approximately 70% of IV based on animal PK studies, potentially lowering the 
exposures in human from IM or S Q dosing.  
 
Safety results from this trial have indicated no significant safety findings following single IM 
or SQ administration of 50, 150 mg, and 450 mg CD388. Regular assessment of blinded 
safety/tolerability data from 66 healthy subjects who received a dose of 50 mg, 150 mg, or 
450 mg of IM or SQ  CD388 or placebo has not identified any concerning safety observations to 
date.  
In summary, excellent safety margins were achieved with CD388 in 3-month toxicity studies relative  to the proposed FIH human dose conservatively scaled to BSA and to the predicted FIH 
plasma exposure. Although no adverse findings were identified, transient minor changes in 
clinical pathology parameters were observed in the absence of other changes, including no 
changes in cytokines and microscopic findings, and no CD388-related effects on kidney or the reticuloendothelial system. The outcome of the CD388 nonclinical safety program supports the 
proposed clinical program. Results from this  FIH study to date have shown no concerning safety 
findings after 50 mg, 150 mg, and 450 mg single-dose CD388 administrations.

4.5. Rationale for Trial Endpoints  
The measures for evaluation of the safety and tolerability profile of CD388 Injection are standard 
for most clinical studies and follow the recommendations in the ICH guidelines. The assessments 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 32 of 85 for determining the plasma and urine concentrations are appropriate to characterize the 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile of CD388. 
Exploratory biomarkers, anti-drug antibodies, and pharmacogenomic research are exploratory in nature and do not have pre-defined endpoints. 
4.6. Statement of Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory and Institutio nal Review

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 35 of 85 6. STUDY DESIGN  
6.1. Description of the Study  
This is a FIH, Phase 1, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind study of ascending 
single doses of CD388 Injection administered IM or SQ to healthy adult subjects followed by 
another single dose of CD388 Injection administered by the same route 3 months or 5 effective 
half-lives , whichever is longer, after the first dose in the middle and high dose groups (dosing 
may be adjusted f or tolerability ). The goals are to assess safety, tolerability, immunogenicity  
(anti-drug antibodies [ADA]), and PK of CD388. 
Dose levels of CD388 to be assessed will follow an ascending single dose design with the starting dose based on findings from 3-month rat and monkey toxicology studies. Within each 
route (IM and SQ dose, route assignment is unblinded), subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of CD388 Injection or saline placebo (treatment assignment is blinded) according to the design in Table 5. It should be noted that each cohort will be divided into 2 groups identified as “sentinel”  groups (randomized 1:1) and “main” groups (randomized 7:2): 
• Low dose (50 mg) level: Cohort 1A (IM) and Cohort 1B (SQ)  – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• Mid dose (150 mg) level: Cohort 2A (IM) and Cohort 2B (SQ)  – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• High dose (450 mg) level: Cohort 3A (IM) and Cohort 3B (SQ)  – each route n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
• H ighest  dose ( 900 mg) level: Cohort 4B (SQ)  – n = 2 sentinel and n = 9 main  
For each route, the sentinel or first group of 2 subjects (1  CD388: 1 placebo) at a dose level  
will be administered blinded study drug and closely monitored for safety for at least 1 week. 
The Principal Investigator (PI) and Sponsor will review blinded safety data after the initial 
sentinel group subjects at a dose level have completed dosing and followed for a minimum of 
1 week. If no drug- related SAEs or drug- related Grade ≥3 A Es have occurred, the subjects in 
the corresponding main group may be dosed within 24 hours. The observation duration may be adjusted for the sentinel groups in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4B based on data from previous cohorts. 
After all subjects at a dose level  (for the IM cohorts and SQ cohorts separately) have completed 
study drug administration and have undergone protocol- specified procedures and assessments 
for ≥14 days, the PI and Sponsor will review blinded safety data, including A Es (including 
reactogenicity/injection site reactions  and hypersensitivity reactions), vital signs, 12- lead ECG s, 
and clinical laboratory  results (including hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, 
and urinalysis) to determine the safety and tolerability of the study drug. The incidence and 
severity of AE s, and adverse changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, and ECGs will 
be taken into consideration when determining safety and tolerability of study drug. Escalation 
between dose levels will be based on review of at least 14 -day post-dose safety data. If the 
dose/route of administration  is determined to be safe and well tolerate d ≥14 days after dosing, 
the next cohort of subjects will be enroll ed and randomized to receive the next higher dose level 
of CD388 Injection or placebo. The data cut-off time point for data review and dose escalation 
decision has been  adjusted for Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B based on data from Cohorts 1A and 
1B.

Note: Immediately prior to the second single dose, within each dose and route, any dropouts   in the sentinel groups will be 
randomly replaced with subjects from the main groups, retaining their original treatment assignment (i.e., subjects assigned to 
placebo will remain placebo, and subjects assigned to C D388 will remain CD388) . 
 
Subjects in Cohort 4B will receive a single dose of CD388 Injection or placebo (SQ). 
Subjects in Cohorts 2A and 2B and Cohorts 3A and 3B will receive a second single dose of 
CD388 Injection or placebo after washout of 5 effective half -lives after the first dose if it is 
determined that the safety and tolerability of the first dose is acceptable upon review of the 
cumulative safety data.  Immediately prior to the second single dose, within each dose and route, 
any dropouts in the sentinel groups will be randomly replaced with subjects from the main groups, retaining their original treatment assignment (i.e., subjects assigned to placebo will remain placebo , and  subjects assigned to CD388 will remain CD388; this  may require unblinded 
personnel to oversee ).  
The PI and Sponsor will review blinded safety data after the initial sentinel group subjects at 
a dose level have completed dosing and followed for the minimum observation period as 
determined during the first single dose. If no drug- related SAEs or  drug -related Grade ≥3 AEs 
have occurred, the subjects in the corresponding main group may be dosed within 24 hours. 
The dose escalation scheme is presented in Section  1.2. 
The Schedule of Events  is presented in Table 1 (first single dose, Cohorts 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 
3B), Table 2 (second single dose, Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B), and Table 3 (single dose, Cohort 
4B). All subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) for observation and safety 
assessments from Day -1 (check -in) to Day 30. Subjects will be monitored for AEs (including 
reactogenicity/ injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions) and SAEs as indicated 
below:

Abbreviation: ICF  = informed consent form.  
Safety will also be assessed by  physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs measurements, 
and laboratory evaluations (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) at various 
time points during and after the CRU stay. Concomitant medication use will be recorded 
throughout the study.

a. Performed at the second administration period only if required to further evaluate observations from prior 
peri-dosing period (at the discretion of the Investigator).  
Blood PK samples, and blood samples to assess ADA will be collected from all subjects for 
the purpose of maintaining the blind, but only samples from the CD388 Injection group will be 
analyzed (using validated assays) by an unblinded central bioanalytical laboratory. After discharge from the CRU, additional sample collection for PK and ADA will be performed at 
specified time points after do sing. The timing of PK sampling has been adjusted for Cohorts 2A, 
2B, 3A, and 3B based on data from previous cohorts. 
Additional blood samples will be collected for pharmacogenomics and exploratory biomarker 
evaluation , and additional blood and urine sampl es will be collected for exploratory metabolite 
identification, to be reported separately. Plasma samples collected for PK analysis may also be 
used for CD388 drug-antibody ratio ( DAR ) distribution and metabolite identification after 
completion of PK analysis. Nasopharyngeal swabs will also be collected for CD388 exploratory assays.  Nasal wash collection will occur during the second single dose at the time of C
max as 
determined from the first single dose. Nasal wash collection for Cohort 4B will occur during dosing on Day 7. 
6.2. Criteria for Evaluation  
6.2.1. Safety and Tolerability of Study Drug 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs (including reactogenicity/injection site reactions , hypersensitivity reactions, and  adverse events of special interest [AESIs] ), vital 
signs, 12- lead ECGs , Holter monitoring , clinical laboratory results (including hematology, 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 38 of 85 coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), and concomitant medication usage throughout the 
study. 
See Section  6.1 for details regarding dose level/cohort enrollment timing and assessment of 
safety and  tolerability for dose escalation decisi on. 
If a dose level is considered not safe or well tolerated, the study drug assignment for the 
subject(s) with the safety issue may be unblinded. The Sponsor may also independently decide 
to unblind the entire cohort for safety concerns or terminate enrollment for any reason. 
If any subject develops a Grade ≥ 2 AE that is deemed related to the study drug, the mechanism 
of the AE may be assessed (i.e., cytokine level, complement activation, immunoglobulin G [IgG] subtypes, immunoglobulin E [ IgE], T-cell/B -cell/monocyte and  basophil activation as 
assessed by flow cytometry, ADA development, and immune complex formation) at Sponsor and Investigator discretion, and the study dose and route may be modified for the remainder of 
the study. 
6.2.2. Pharmac okinetics/Anti- drug Antibodies  
Pharmacokinetics will be determined by analyzing plasma samples for concentration of CD388 
obtained from subjects who receive CD388 Injection in each cohort at various time points after administration of  the first and  second single doses of the study drug. Blood samples collected for 
PK analysis  may also be used for metabolite identification after completion of PK analysis, along 
with urine samples . Plasma samples , nasopharyngeal swabs, and nasal washes  will be analyzed 
for th e concentration of CD388. Anti- drug antibodies (ADA) will also be measured at selected 
time points by a validated ELISA method. 
6.2.3. Pharmacogenomics 
A mandatory pharmacogenomic (DNA) blood sample will be collected once, preferably on 
Day 1 (collection at another time point is allowed if necessary) to allow for genetic research to 
help understand the characteristics of CD388. Genetic analysis will be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help explore genetic markers that could explain differences in safety, immunogenicity, or clinical response among subje cts. Host DNA assessment will be limited to 
research related to CD388. They may also be used to develop tests/assays related to CD388 and flu-like disease.  
Analyses of host DNA may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately from the s tudy report. 
6.2.4. Exploratory Biomarkers 
Blood samples will be collected to allow for the exploration of biomarkers (such as but not limited to RNA or proteins) on the assumption that these markers may play a role in the response (safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity ) to CD388. 
These samples and r emaining material from other samples may be used for further assay 
optimization/ qualification, biomarkers, or further exploratory analyses. Samples will only be 
used for research  related to influenza virus infection, flu- like disease, and safety , reactogenicity , 
and immunogenicity of CD388. They may also be used to develop t ests/assays related to CD388 
and influenza. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 39 of 85 Analyses of biomarkers may be conducted at the Sponsor’s discretion and reported separately 
from the study report. 
6.3. Number of Subjects  
Up to 77 subjects will be enrolled in this study, with approximately 56 of the se subjects expected 
to receive CD388 Injection. 
6.4. Measures Taken  to Minimize Bias  
Study drug assignment (CD388 Injection or placebo) will be blinded to all blinded clinical site 
and Sponsor study team until the final study database is locked. Unblinded personnel include the 
site pharmacist (or pharmacist designee)  preparing the injections,  the unblinded pharmacy 
monitor (to ensure study drug accountability and assignment throughout the trial), and  the 
Sponsor’s unblinded team.  
Administration route assignment (IM or SQ) is not blinded. 
6.5. Expected Duration of Subject Participation  
A single dose of study drug will be administered IM or SQ on Day 1. Study participation 
will require up to 28 days for screening procedures, and ~120 days for the first single dose 
(check -in to the CRU on Day -1; CRU inpatient stay for study drug administration, observation, 
and assessments and procedures for 31 days [Days -1 to Day 30]; and 4 CRU outpatient visits 
for additional assessments and pr ocedures).  
Subjects in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B who receive a second single dose will have an additional 168 days of participation, with similar study visits  to that of the first admin istration . 
6.6. Method of Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened for study eligibility before randomization. 
Within each route (IM and SQ dose, route assignment is unblinded), subjects will be randomized 
to receive a single dose of CD388 Injection or saline placebo (t reatment assignment is blinded) . 
The study site’s pharmacist (or pharmacist designee) will obtain the study drug assignment via an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) or by a manual paper transaction . 
A subject is considered randomized when a randomizati on transaction is recorded in the IRT 
or the subject’s source documents if performed  manually . 
All blinded study personnel (including the Sponsor, Investigator, and site personnel directly involved in study conduct) and subjects will remain blinded to study drug assignment until the 
study is completed and the final database is locked with the exception of the unblinded pharmacy 
personnel, pharmacy monitor, and unblinded Sponsor personnel ( such as Data Review 
Committe e, clinical suppl y manager, PK lead , and quality manager ) who may be unblinded to 
study medication at any time during study conduct. The pharmacy monitor will monitor study drug preparation and accountability during the study and cases in which unblinding is required due to a safety or tolerability issue. To maintain study blinding, study drug preparation will be 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 40 of 85 performed by an unblinded site pharmacist (or qualified unblinded personnel at the study site not 
involved with study procedures or evaluations). 
Instructions for study drug preparation and dosing are outlined in the Pharmacy Manual provided 
separately to the site. In the case of a medical emergency requiring the Investigator to know the identity of the study drug, the Investigator will follow the procedures outlined in Section  8.4. 
6.7. Data Review Committee  
A Sponsor Data Review Committee, consisting of representatives of the Sponsor not involved in 
day-to-day management of the study, may be established to review unblinded data to allow 
strategic development decisions within and across development programs. The procedures of the Data Review Committee will be documented in a charter.

7.4.1. Subject Stopping Rules  
Subjects in Cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B will be followed through Outpatient Visit 4 (OV4)  of 
the first dosing period, and will not receive the second single dose: 
• If the subject develops anaphylaxis or a  related Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE  
• If the subject has a persistent (i.e., >5 days with no response to treatment) Grade ≥2 rash 
considered related to the investigational drug by the Principal Investigator ( Appendix 4) 
• If the Investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the subject to not receive 
a second dose 
• If the subject no longer meets all eligibility criteria prior to the second single dose  
• If the subject becomes pregnant prior to the second single dose 
If a subject is removed from the study for any reason, the subject will be followed for resolution of any ongoing AE(s). 
7.4.2. Withdrawal from Study Protocol 
Subjects may withdraw consent to participate in this study at any time without penalty or loss of 
benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Subjects who wish to withdraw completely from this clinical study should be encouraged to complete the OV4  assessments. Every 
reasonable effort should be made to determine the reason a subject withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Subject is unable or unwilling to continue 
• Subject elects to withdraw informed consent 
• Adverse event (whether or not related to study drug) that precludes further participation 
in the study in the judgment of an  Investigator and/or Sponsor 
• Protocol non- compliance  
• Subject lost to follow -up, or follow-up is not possible 
• The Investigator considers that it is in the subject’s best interest not to continue 
participation in  the study

laboratory abnormality to the investigational drug. A transient CK increase after IM 
injection is to be considered “ not related ” to the study drug.) 
• If ≥1 subject experiences a Grade 4 AE or laboratory abnormality within 28 days after 
study drug administration, considered attributable to CD388 or cannot be attributed to 
another cause 
If it is considered appropriate to restart the study following an internal safety review,

Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 46 of 85 8. STUDY DRUG  
8.1. CD388  Injection 
CD388 Injec tion is a clear  to lightly opalescent liquid  essentially  free of particulate matter 
containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient, CD388. CD388 Injection is supplied as a frozen 
sterile solution in single- use vials . Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details.  
CD388 Injection is administered by either IM or SQ injection at the dose described in Table 5, depending upon the subject’s randomization assignment. Dose levels to be assessed will follow 
an ascending single-dose regimen with the starting dose based on findings from 3-month rat 
and monkey toxicology studies. 
8.1.1. Directions for Use  
CD388 Injection  should be thawed at room temperature over 30 minutes (not to exceed 24 hours) 
prior to drawing the dose from the vial into the syringe. 
After CD388 Injection is drawn from the vial into the syringe, it must be administered  within 
4 hours. 
8.1.2. Drug Storage 
Vials of CD388 Injection should be stored frozen at -20°C. 
8.1.3. Dose Adjustment  
Dosage adjustments of CD388 Injection in individual subjects are not allowed in this study. 
8.2. Placebo Injection  
Normal saline will be administered IM or SQ as the placebo control.  
8.3. Compliance  
Treatment compliance for CD388 Injection/placebo  will be documented in the eCRF by 
recording the date, administration  time, and the volume of the dose of study drug administered . 
8.4. Breaking the Blind  
The study is a double-blind design. The Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and subjects 
will not make any effort to determine which blinded study drug (CD388 Injection or placebo) is 
administered. Unblinded pharmacy personnel will be responsible for preparing syringes such that 
the double-blind is maintained. 
Only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of a specific subject, may the Investigator unblind a subject’s study drug 
assignment. 
As soon as possible and without revealing the subject’s study drug assignment (unless important 
to the safety of subjects remaining in the study), the Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 47 of 85 blind is broken for any reason. The Investigator will record in source documentation the date 
and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment for that subject. 
As PK samples from subjects assigned to placebo treatment will not be analyzed for determination of CD388 concentrations, the bioanalytical laboratory will receive the 
randomization list to allow for correct selection of the samples. Unblinding of the randomiz ed 
treatment  assignment will be performed at the bioanalytical laboratory. Specific procedures will 
be in place to ensure that randomiz ed treatment  assignment will not be revealed to anyone 
involved in the execution of the study. 
The Sponsor may conduct an interim analysis of selected safety and efficacy study data. Study 
team members involved in day- to-day trial related activities will not have access to interim 
analysis data which might unblind them at the subject level. Unblinding at treatment/group level is permitted as needed to enable the analysis. After the database is  locked and the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) is final, the study blind codes will be broken.  
8.5. Previous and Concomitant Medications and Substances  
All medications administered within 30 days prior to study drug administration and  throughout 
the study will be documented and recorded in the eCRF.  
Subjects must refrain from over-the-counter (OTC) and nutritional supplements within 7 days 
and prescription medications within 14 days or <5 half- lives before first study drug 
administration, and until after the final study visit (except for hormonal contraceptives, 
acetaminophen, or ibuprofen). The Investigator should consult the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor for guidance regarding other medication or vaccine usage during the study. 
8.6. Accountability Procedures  
The pharmacy or study personnel are responsible for ensuring that a current record of CD388 Injection  inventory and accountability are maintained.  
A Pharmacy Monitor will be responsible for checking drug accountability at the site. 
Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by regulatory authorities at any time. 
Each shipment of study drug will require acknowledgment of receipt. Upon receipt of study drug, the pharmacy or study personnel will visually inspect the shipment and verify the number and condition of vials received. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information. 
8.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Unless expressly disallowed by institution rules or local regulations, used and unused vials of CD388 Injection will be retained at the study site until s tudy drug accountability has been 
performed by the Pharmacy Monitor. Upon completion of the study, termination of the study, or upon written authorization from the Sponsor, all retained unused and partially used study drug will be centrally destroyed  or de stroyed at the site upon written authorization from Sponsor, 
unless expressly disallowed by local regulations. Adequate documentation to support destruction is required prior to destruction of the vials, and a certificate of destruction or written documentation that specifies the date, quantity, lot numbers, and method of destruction that is 
traceable to the study drug must be provided to the Sponsor. All records of disposal will be 
maintained by the Sponsor.

applicable study assessments, including allowable windows for study visits and assessments/
procedures. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study- related procedures are 
performed . 
All procedures should be completed as close to the prescribed/scheduled time as possible. Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take precedence 
over all routine scheduled procedures. 
When multiple assessments are scheduled at the same time point, perform the assessments in the 
following order: 12- lead ECG , vital signs, and blood sample collection.  
9.1. Medical History  
A complete medical history will be recorded, including demographic information (age, gender, race, and ethnicity ).  
9.2. Physical Examination s 
A complete physical examination is required at screening. Targeted  (i.e., symptom directed) 
physical examinations may be performed at all other indicated visits, and as clinically indicated. 
9.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and dias tolic), heart rate,  respiration rate,  and oral 
temperature, and will be measured with the subject in a seated position for at least 3 minutes 
prior to measurement. Height and weight are to be measured and body mass index (BMI) 
calculated  when indicated. 
9.4. Electrocardiograms  
Subjects should be resting and semi-recumbent for safety 12- lead ECGs. Data collection includes 
abnormal findings; if abnormal finding(s) are assessed as clinically significant, the finding(s) should be reported as AE(s). The Investigator is responsible for interpreting and measuring ECG data.  
Continuous digital ECG recording will be performed using a 12-lead Holter ECG monitor.  
• For Cohorts 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and 3B:   
Pharmacodynamic ECG tracings, including all 12- leads and  of 10 seconds dura tion, will 
be extracted in triplicate at prespecified time points for a 5 -minute observation period 
starting from 1 hour before dosing until 48 hours after administration of study drug 
(expected time to maximum concentration is 1 to 2 days after administra tion), and stored 
in a digital format. Holter monitoring may be longer or shorter depending on available 
PK data. Subjects should be resting and semi-recumbent for 15 minutes prior to the first 
predose Holter ECG monitor data extraction time point until th e 2-hour PK sample 
collection and Holter ECG monitoring data extraction. Subjects may use the restroom 
during this period, except for the 15-minute window prior to ECG data extraction and for

Supplemental information may be requested , including the following: hospital records, 
laboratory results, radiology reports, progress notes, admission and emergency room notes, holding and observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates . 
Relevant case report form (CRF) pages can be appended to communicate information relevant to 
the SAE, including study drug administration details, medical history, concomitant medications, 
relevant laboratory test results , and subject outcome information. The SAER should be emailed 
within 24 hours with as much of the above information as available at the time. The following 
minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: subject identification, Investigator 
contact in formation , an adverse  event with a serious outcome, and the I nvestigator’s assessment 
of causal relationship to study drug. S erious adverse event s are to be reported immediately 
and under no circumstance should this reporting time exceed 24 hours following knowledge of 
the SAE. Supplemental information may be transmitted using a follow-up report and should not delay the initial report. The Sponsor may contact the investigational site to solicit additional information or follow up on the event. 
The Investiga tor must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. 
Any medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the subject’s eCRF.

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 56 of 85 If the Investigator becomes aware of any SAEs that  occur after the study period that are believed 
to be causally related to use of the investigational product, they should notify the Sponsor 
immediately.  
The Sponsor will report all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) within the 
require d regulatory timeframes to all applicable regulatory authorities and to Investigators as 
required. 
All SAEs that do not meet expedited reporting requirements will be summarized in the 
Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) and reported annually by the Sponsor as required. 
11.3.2. Notification of Emerging Safety Issues 
Additionally, the Investigator should alert the Sponsor immediately (under no circumstance 
should this reporting time exceed 24 hours) by contacting the Medical Monitor of any new 
findings that neces sitate the implementation of urgent safety measures to protect subjects against 
any immediate hazard. If time permits, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor to discuss the 
hazard and any actions taken or to be taken prior to implementation.  
The Sponsor is responsible for informing other investigators who may need to implement the 
same procedures and for alerting the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees of the new findings and measures taken in accordance with local regulations within the requi red timeframes.  
11.4. Definitions  
11.4.1. Adverse Event  
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug or study procedure in humans, whether or not considered drug- related. An AE can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (e.g. , a clinical ly significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality. An AE can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with 
another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. However, each laboratory abnormality (e.g., clinically significant changes detected on hematology, coagulation, chemistry, 
urinalysis) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical 
intervention, or that leads to interruption of study drug or discontinuation, must be recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clinical condition 
or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal test assessments (e.g., ECGs) that are associated with signs or symptoms must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they 
meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Section  11.4.1 and  Section  11.4.4, 
respectively.  
11.4.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 57 of 85 “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE. “ Suspected adverse reaction ” implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than “ adverse reaction ”, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
11.4.3. Life-Threatening AE or Life- Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ life threatening ” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It  does 
not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
11.4.4. Serious Adverse Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE – see definition above 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug 
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
11.4.5. Unexpected AE or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected”: 
• If it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the nature, severity, 
frequency, or outcome that has been observed 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by vir tue of 
greater specificity) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
“Unexpected ”, as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that 
are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 58 of 85 11.4.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI s) include anaphylaxis (r efer to Appendix 3 for 
diagnostic criteria and management).  
11.4.7. Emerging Safety Issue 
Any new safety information that may lead to a reassessment of the risk/benefit balance of the 
investigational product and/or impact subjects’ health. Examples include: 
• Any new safety issue relating to the conduct of the clinical trial that may impact the 
safety of the trial subjects such as significant safety results from a recently -completed 
non-clinical study or early termination or temporary suspension of a trial for safety 
reasons that is conducted on the same investigational product 
• Recommendations from a Data Review Committee  that may affect the safety of trial 
subjects  
11.4.8. Urgent Safety Measure  
An urgent safety measure (USM) is a procedure not defined by the protocol that can be put in place immediately , without prior authorization from Ethics Committees or Regulatory 
Authorities , in order to protect  study subject s from any immediate hazard to their health 
and safety.  
11.5. Adverse Event Classification  
11.5.1. Relationship to Study  Drug  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and nonserious ; 
Table 8). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for determining 
the causal assessment. If the event is thought to be unrelated to study drug administration, an alternative explanation should be provided. 
Table 8: Guidelines for Assessing Relationship of Event to Study Drug  
Unrelated  There is little or no chance that the study drug caused the adverse event ( AE); other  conditions, 
including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of  the disease state, or  a reaction 
to a concomitant medication best explain the event . 
Related  The association of the AE with the study drug is unknown; however, the AE is not clearly due to 
another condition, or a reasonable temporal association exists between the AE and study drug 
administration and,  based on the Investigator's clinical experience, the association of the AE 
with the study dr ug seems likely . 
 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 59 of 85 11.5.2. Severity  
The Investigator will use the grading scale in Table 9 to  describe the intensity of the AE 
following general categorical desc riptors outlined in the DAIDS table for Grading the Severity of 
Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events ( DAIDS  2017 ).  
Table 9: Guidelines for Severity Assessment s 
Grade 1  
Mild Mild symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional activities 
with intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  
Moderate  Moderate symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and functional activities with intervention indicated
 
Grade 3  
Severe  Severe symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities with intervention or hospitalization indicated
 
Grade 4  
Potentially Lif e 
Threatening  Potentially life -threatening symptoms causing inability to perform basic self -care functions 
with intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death 
Grade 5  
Death  Fatal  
Refer to the DAIDS table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events  for details regarding 
event grading.  
11.5.3. Serious Adverse Even t 
Any adverse experience occurring at any dose of study medication that occurs during time  
periods indicated below are considered serious if they r esult in any of the outcomes listed in 
Section  11.4.4.  
Cohort SAE monitoring period from signing of Informed Consent Form: 
1A, 1B Through 4 months after the dose of study drug 
2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4B Through 205 days after the last dose of study drug (Day 206 ±10 days) 
Hospitalization for a planned or elective procedure or surgery for a pre-existing condition that 
has not worsened is not considered an SAE. 
11.6. Adverse Event Follow Up  
All unresolved SAEs and study drug- related  AEs will be followed by the study staff until 
resolution or deemed stable , regardless of severity . 
11.7. Adverse Event Management  
The Investigator should employ best medical judgement in determining how to manage AEs. Any questions regarding AE management should be directed to the Medical Monitor.

CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 60 of 85 11.8. Risks for Women of Child bearing Potential or During Pregnancy  
The risks of CD388 Injection in pregnant or lactating/nursing women are unknown. Pregnant 
or nursing female subjects are excluded from this study. 
Subjects must be instructed to inform the Investigator immediately if they or their partner 
becomes pregnant during the study. In the case of a partner pregnancy, partner informed 
consent must be attained prior to collecting information related to the pregnancy and to allow 
the Investigator to follo w them for the outcome of the pregnancy. In the event of a confirmed 
pregnancy, the following actions should be taken: 
• The pregnancy should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the subject notifying the Investigator using the applicable Pregnancy Report Form. 
• The Investigator should counsel female subjects regarding the possible effects of CD388 
Injection exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study site of the outcome of the 
pregnancy. 
• The subject or subject’s partner, if consented, should be monitored until the postnatal day 28 or until termination of the pregnancy. The outcome should be reported using 
the Pregnancy Outcome or Abnormal Pregnancy Outcome form. 
Pregnancy is not an AE, in and of itself. However, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered an SAE and will be reported as described in the AE 
and SAE sections. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy outcome post-study 
must be reported to the Medical Monitor.

• apparent clearance (CL/F) 
• apparent volume of distribution (V Z/F)  
• area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to time of last quantifiable 
sample (AUC 0-t) 
• area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity 
(AUC 0-∞)  
CD388 concentration in the upper respiratory tract as  determined from nasopharyngeal (NP) 
swabs  collection  will be summarized  and reported separately . 
Pharmacokinetic parameter estimation will be performed by non- compartmental analysis (NCA) 
with Phoenix® WinNonlin® version 8 or higher. The actual elapsed sampling times relative to 
dosing will be recorded during the study and will be used in the NCA analysis. P harmacokinetic 
data handling and analysis will be further detailed in the SAP.  
Descriptive statis tics will be calculated  for plasma concentrations at each individual time point 
and for all PK parameters. Mean and individual plasma concentration- time profiles will be 
presented graphically. 
Pharmacokinetic samples for CD388 from this study may also be i ncluded in a population PK 
analysis, which will be reported separately. 
12.5. Analyses of Metabolite Identification, Pharmacogenomics, 
Exploratory Biomarkers, and Anti- Drug Antibodies  
Analysis of the ADA results is to be determined  and may include determination of the subject’s 
positive/negative ADA status at baseline, treatment-emergent ADA in subjects with a negative 
baseline, as well as a post -baseline increase in titer for subjects with positive ADA at baseline . 
Metabolite identification and profiling, CD388 in urine and nasal wash, CD388 DAR 
distribution , CD388 glycoforms, pharmacogenomics, and exploratory biomarkers will be 
reported separately.

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 76 of 85 APPENDIX  3. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND MANAGEMENT FOR 
ANAPHYLAXI S 
Diagnostic Criteria  for Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips, -tongue, -uvula) 
and at least one  of the following: 
a. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely al lergen for 
that subject  (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e .g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subje ct (minutes to 
several hours): 
a. Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or >30% decrease from that person's baseline 
 
Management of Anaphylaxis 
1. Epinephrine:  When a subject meets any of the diagnostic criteria, the subject  should 
receive epinephrine immediately, as  it is the treatment of choice in anaphylaxis. Aqueous 
epinephrine, 0.01 mg/kg (maximum dose, 0.5 mg) administered intramuscularly every 
5 to 15 minutes as necessary, is the recommended dosage for controlling symptoms and maintaining blood pressure. The 5-minute interval between injections can be 
liberalized to permit more frequent injections if deemed necessary by the clinician.  
2. Oxygen and adrenergic agonists:  High -flow oxygen (through a nonrebreather mask 
or endotracheal tube) should be administered to su bjects  experiencing respiratory 
symptoms or hypoxemia. Those who are hemodynamically unstable might benefit from oxygen as well. Inhaled β
2-agonists, such as albuterol, might be useful for bronchospasm 
refractory to epinephrine. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 77 of 85 3. Positioning of the subject : Subjects in anaphylactic shock (i.e., those with anaphylaxis 
and signs of critical organ hypoperfusion) should be placed in a recumbent position with 
the lower extremities elevated unless precluded by shortness of breath or vomiting. 
4. Fluid resuscitation:  Subjects who remain hypotensive despite epinephrine should have 
aggressive fluid resuscitation. Large volumes of crystalloid might be needed in the first 5 to 10 minutes; in severe reactions with hypotension, up to 35% of the blood volume might extravasate in the first 10 minutes, and vasodilatation can cause pooling, with even more reduction in the effective blood volume and thus distributive shock. 
5. Vasopressors:  Potent vasopressors, such as noradrenaline, vasopressin, or metaraminol, 
might be required to overcome vasodilatation if epinephrine and fluid resuscitation have failed to maintain a systolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mmHg. 
6. H
1- and H 2-antihistamines:  Antihistamines (H 1- and H 2-antagonists) are slower in onset 
of action than epinephrine, have little effect on blood pressure, and should be considered a second -line treatment for anaphylaxis. 
7. Corticosteroi ds: Because the onset of action is slow, steroids are not useful in the acute 
management stage. It has been suggested that their use might prevent a protracted or biphasic reaction . 
8. Glucagon for persistent hypotension in subjects taking β -blocker: Theoretically, there 
are multiple mechanisms by which β -blockade could blunt the response to epinephrine. 
If administration of ep inephrine in these subjects is ineffective, administration of 
glucagon can be attempted. Glucagon is thought to reverse refractory hypotension and bronchospasm by activating adenylate cyclase independent of the β -receptor; 
however, the occurrence and importance of this mechanism of action in anaphylaxis is unproved. 
9. Observation: After the treatment of an anaphylactic reaction, an observation period 
should be considered for all subjects as the reaction might recur as the effect of 
epinephrine wears off (intramuscular epinephrine results in increased serum levels for an hour or more) and because of the risk of a biphasic reaction (1–72 hours after the acute 
reaction).

Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 78 of 85 APPENDIX  4. RASH MANAGEMENT  
For subjects reporting rash, the following should be performed:  
All rashes will be discussed between the Investigator and the Sponsor, and in case of a causal 
relationship between the rash and the study drug, then the following visits and assessments will be performed as indicated below and in the “Visit Schedule for Rash Management” 
(see Appendix 5). Unscheduled follow-up visits for close follow-up of rash will be performed 
based on the grade (severity) of the rash. At the Investigator’s discretion, additional visits and assessments may  be performed.  
The rash event should be captured in the AE s ection of the eCRF, as well as in more detail in the 
specific rash assessment pages of the eCRF.  
In case of rash, blood samples need to be collected  for safety laboratory testing, and processed by 
the local laboratory. These samples need to be collected  during the unscheduled visits as 
described below and in Appendix 5. A copy of the local laboratory reports should be anonymized and will be retrieved  by the monitor. 
The following parameters need to be tested: AST, ALT, creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a complete blood cell count (including hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell [ RBC] 
count, white blood cell [ WBC ] count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, 
basophils, and platelet count). 
Digital pictures need to be taken as described below and in  Appendix 5. Digital pictures will be 
anonymized and stored on the Sponsor’s secure server. Only the study team will have access to 
the pictures.  
The subject may be treated symptomatically until the rash resolves. If the rash is considered to be most likely due to concomitant illness or non-study medication, standard management, including 
discontinuation of the likely causative agent, should be undertaken, and the continuation of the 
subject in the study should be discussed with the Sponsor. 
Dermatologist fees for evaluating subjects who experience a rash will be reimbursed by the 
Sponsor. 
The following grades are based on the DAIDS Toxicity Grading Scale ( DAIDS  2017) with 
adaptations made by the Sponsor: Subjects should be informed that they should contact their doctor and visit the clinic 
immediately (unscheduled visit, day 1 of the rash) when they notice any rash.  
Grade 1 Rash 
A Grade 1 rash is defined as erythema . 
• Subjects may continue the intake of study drug(s) (at the Investigator’s discretion). 
• An unscheduled visit for initial rash evaluation (day 1 of the rash) is required. 
• Assessment of safety blood samples by the local laboratory is required. A copy of the 
local laboratory report should be anonymi zed and will be retrieved  by the monitor. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 79 of 85 • Digital pictures should be taken within 24 hours after the onset of the rash. 
• Referral to a dermatologist is only needed if the rash diagnosis is uncertain (preferably 
within 24 hours after the onset of the rash). A copy of the dermatologist’s report should be anonym ized and will be retrieved  by the monitor. 
• Cetirizine, levocetirizine, topical corticosteroids, or antipruritic agents may be prescribed.  
• The description of the rash should be reported per ‘Unscheduled V isit in Case of Rash’ in 
the eCRF (i .e., the initial rash assessment pages).  
For close follow-up of the rash, unscheduled visits will also be performed 1 and 7 days after the i
nitial assessment of the rash. At these visits, safety blood samples and digital pictures should be 
taken. The follow-up rash assessment pages of the eCRF should be completed for all follow-up 
visits. For these and all subsequent local laboratory blood sample assessments: a copy of the 
local laboratory reports should be anonymized and will be retrieved  by the monitor. 
If the rash is unresolved after 7 days, additional unscheduled visits may  be  performed at the 
Investigator’s discretion. Upon resolution/stabilization of the rash, digital pictures should be 
taken and the final rash assessment pages of the eCRF should be completed. 
The subject should be advised to contact the Investigator immediately if there is any 
w
orsening of the rash, if any systemic signs or symptoms appear, or if mucosal involvement 
develops.  
In case th e rash evolves from a Grade 1 to a higher grade, additional unscheduled visits have to 
be conducted according to the guidelines for Grade 2 or Grade 3–4 rash, respectively. 
Grade 2 Rash 
A Grade 2 rash is defined as diffuse, maculopapular rash OR dry desqua mation . 
• Subjects will permanently discontinue the intake of study drugs and be withdrawn from 
the study. No rechallenge is allowed. 
Note : Subjects experiencing Grade 2 rash following the last intake of study drug may 
continue in the study as long as they are not re-exposed to suspect study drug. 
• An unscheduled visit for initial rash evaluation (day 1 of the rash) is required. 
• Assessment of safety blood samples by the local laboratory is required. A copy of the 
local laboratory report should be anonymized an d will be retrieved  by the monitor. 
• Digital pictures should be taken within 24 hours after the onset of the rash. 
• Referral to a dermatologist is required, preferably within 24 hours after the onset of the rash. A copy of the dermatologist’s report should be anonymized and will be retrieved  by 
the monitor. 
• A biopsy is performed (preferably within 24 hours after the onset of the rash) if advised by the dermatologist. A copy of the biopsy report should be anonymized and will be retrieved  by the monitor. 
• Cetirizine, levocetirizine, topical corticosteroids, or antipruritic agents may be prescribed. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol CD388.IM.SQ.1.01  
CD388 Injection  
Amendment 2 Confidential  Page 80 of 85 • The description of the rash should be reported per ‘Unscheduled Visit in Case of Rash’ in 
the eCRF (i .e., the initial rash assessment pages).  
For close follow-up of the rash, unscheduled visits will also be performed 1 and 7 days after the 
i
nitial assessment of the rash. At these visits, safety blood samples and digital pictures should be 
taken. The follow-up rash assessment pages of the eCRF should be completed for all follow-up 
visits. For these and all subsequent local laboratory blood sample assessments: a copy of the 
local laboratory reports should be anonymized and will be retrieved  by the monitor. 
If the rash is unresolved after 7 days: 
• And there is an increase in AST/ALT of 1 or 2 times the baseline value OR an increase in AST/ALT of less than 5 times the ULN, subjects should be followed weekly with 
repeated local lab assessments and digital pictures until resolution of the AST/ALT 
abnormalities.  
• And there is no increase in AST/ALT, additional unscheduled visits (including local lab assessments and digital pictures) may  be performed at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Upon resolution/stabilization of the rash, digital pictures should be taken and the final rash assessment pages of the eCRF should be completed. 
The subject should be advised to contact the Investigator immediately if the rash fails to 
resolve (after more than 2 weeks), if there is any worsening of the rash, if any systemic signs or allergic s ymptoms develop, or if mucosal involvement develops. 
In case the rash evolves from a Grade 2 to a Grade 3 –4 rash, additional unscheduled visits must 
be conducted according to the guidelines for Grade 3–4 rash. 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 Rash  
A Grade 3 rash is defi ned as: 
• vesiculation, moist desquamation, or ulceration  OR 
• cutaneous event with one of the following  (revised by the Sponsor): 
− elevations in AST/ALT more than 2×  baseline value and  ≥5 × ULN  
− fever >38°C or 100°F

• An unscheduled visit for initial rash evaluation (day 1 of the rash) is required. 
• Assessment of safety blood samples by the local laboratory is required on the day of initial 
rash evaluation and the day thereafter ( days 1 and 2 of the rash), and as indicated below. 
A copy of the local laboratory report should be anonymized  and will be retrieved  by the 
monitor. 
• Digital pictures should be taken within 24 hours after the onset of the rash and on day  1 of 
the rash , and as indicated below.  
• Referral to a dermatologist is required, preferably within 24 hours after the onset of the rash. A copy of the dermatologist’s report should be anonymized  and will be retrieved  by the

• The description of the rash should be reported per ‘Unscheduled Visit in Case of Rash’ in the 
eCRF (i .e., the initial rash assessment pages). The follow-up rash assessment pages of the 
eCRF should be completed for all follow-up visits. 
For close follow -
 up of the rash, unscheduled visits will be performed as follows: 
• Follow-up visits on days 2, 3, and 4 of the rash  are required. Additional safety blood samples 
and digital pictures are to be taken on these days only if the subject’s AST/ALT on day 1 
and/or day 2 of rash >2 × baseline value, and/or ≥5  × ULN and/or in case of rash progression.

laboratory report should be anonymized and will be retrieved  by the monitor. 
• A  follow-up visit on day 6 of the rash is required and additional safety blood samples 
and digital pictures are to be taken regardless of the day 1/2 AST/ALT levels or rash 
progression. 
• Thereafter, weekly follow -up visits are required (or more frequently at the Investigator’s 
discretion) as long as Grade 3–4 rash is present. Once Grade 3 –4 rash has resolved to 
Grade ≤ 2, follow -up should be performed  according to the instructions for follow-up visits 
for Grade 1 or Grade 2 rash, respectively. 
• As long as the rash remains Grade 3 or 4, additional safety blood samples and digital pictures 
are required at these weekly follow -up visits only if the subject’s AST/ALT on day 6 of rash 
is still >2 × baseline value and/or ≥5 × ULN and/or in case of rash progression, until

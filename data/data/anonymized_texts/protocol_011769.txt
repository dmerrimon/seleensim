Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 7Primary Objectives:
A. To Identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for combination 
treatment of nivolumab and veliparib in patients with advanced solid 
tumors and lymphoma with and without mutations in selected DNA 
repair genes.
Secondary Objectives:
A. To evaluate the toxicities and tolerability of nivolumab and veliparib 
in the study population.
B.To evaluate the  efficacy of veliparib and nivolumab measured by overall 
response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and progression free 
survival (PFS) using RECIST v1.1, Lugano classification, and irRECIST.  
For the  preliminary efficacy analysis, ORR will be computed at the first 
imaging (8 weeks). Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated by RECISTv 1.1. 
As exploratory analysis, irRECIST will be used to obtain preliminary 
efficacy as well.  All ORR will use the first imaging time point whether 
RECIST or irRECIST.
C. To  evaluate Overall Survival (OS) at 3 years from the start of treatment.
D. To  evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 24 
weeks in this population.
Exploratory Objectives:
A.Biomarker  tests will be performed at baseline using fresh tissue (or 
archived if a fresh biopsy is not feasible), as well as from blood samples at 
Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and the End of Treatment visit.To evaluate if 
any of the following predict response to veliparib in combination with nivolumab:
Tissue  PD-L1 protein expression
Immune cell infiltration markers
B.To demonstrate  the pharmacodynamic effects of veliparib and nivolumab  
on biomarkers including PD-L1, TILs, T cell subpopulations, and T cell 
receptor genotype.

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 8Sample sizeThe initial  study design was to accrue a total of up to 50 patients for 48 evaluable) 
to the study in two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. The original 
design anticipated a total of 6-18 patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma 
in the dose escalation phase; 9 patients were enrolled, including 3 at lowest dose and 
6 that were treated at the MTD of 400 mg BID. It is still planned for 6 patients  with 
advanced solid tumors and lymphoma with mutations in selected DNA repair 
genes to be enrolled  into the expansion cohort to receive the maximum tolerated 
dose of veliparib in combination with nivolumab. However, due to funding issues, the 
study will perform an early analysis of preliminary efficacy after the next 6 patients are 
enrolled in the expansion cohort, all with the genetic mutation. Of the 6 patients already at 
MTD, 4 have the genetic mutation. No responses were observed in any patient at MTD. 
Total number of patients at the end of adding 6 more patients with mutation will be 
4+6=10. The study will be considered a “success” if the lower exact 90%  confidence limit 
is > 10%, i.e. when 3 or more successes are observed. 
. According to the modified plan for the current trial, the study will be closed after the 6 
additional patients will have been recruited.”

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 10Treatment PlanPatients will be  treated using a dose escalation plan based on a 3+3 design. 
The starting dosing for veliparib will be 300 mg PO twice daily, and treatment 
will begin as monotherapy during a 7-day induction period. Patients in Phase 
Ib will be treated at the MTD.
Nivolumab combination  therapy will begin Cycle 1 Day 1 as follows:
Cycle 1-4:  240 mg IV every 14 days (Day 1 & 15)
Cycle 5+:  480mg IV every 28 days (Day 1 of each cycle).  
Combination treatment  will continue until disease progression unacceptable 
toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.
This treatment plan  is applicable for patients in both the dose escalation and 
dose expansion cohorts.
Statistical 
MethodologyThe primary analysis will be based on toxicity and maximum tolerated dose. 
For all analyses, the intent-to-treat (ITT) population will be used to include all 
evaluable patients. Clinical benefit rate will be defined as stable disease (for 
≥12 weeks) and complete or partial response by the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Lugano classification will be used for 
lymphomas. Maximum response prior to disease progression will be used. The 
overall response rate will be estimated by the proportion of overall response, 
and its 90% lower bound will be estimated using the exact binomial distribution. 
If this lower bound > 10% (ie. at least three responses are observed) the trial 
will be considered a success. 
Additionally, we will evaluate overall response rate, separately for patients with 
and for those without genetic mutation entertained in this study, Early analysis of 
preliminary efficacy will be based on the patients with genetic mutation (n=10).  
Response is defined as complete or partial response using RECIST guidelines 
in a similar manner. We will also perform similar analyses using Immune 
Related RECIST (irRECIST). Duration of response, defined as the duration 
from the first documentation of clinical benefit to the first documented 
progressive disease or death of any cause, whichever occurs first, will also be 
analyzed. For patients alive and progression-free at the time of data cut off, 
duration of response will be censored as of the last tumor assessment date. 
Duration of response will only be evaluated for the subgroup of patients with a 
clinical benefit using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Initial Version  Date: October 6, 2016
Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 111.0 INTRODUCTION – BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
1.1 Significant  unmet need in treatment of advanced cancers: 
Despite the  success of molecularly targeted drugs against the activity of one or more 
proteins involved in tumorigenesis, these agents only benefit a small proportion of 
patients. Many tumors do not possess an actionable mutation and have limited 
therapeutic options for subsequent therapy. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
has expanded therapeutic options and produced durable responses among immunogenic 
tumors. However, response is only seen in a poorly defined subset of patients and many 
patients are refractory to such treatment or relapse after such therapy. We must 
investigate ways to increase the number of patients with different histologies that may 
benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition and extend duration of response through the 
use of novel combination therapy.
1.2 Synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors:  
Inhibitors of  poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) have demonstrated the biological 
concept of synthetic lethality.1-3 Two genes are synthetically lethal if loss of either alone is 
viable whereas  concurrent loss results in cell death.4 It has been demonstrated that 
BRCA1 and  BRCA2 dysfunction sensitized cells to PARP inhibition, resulting in genomic 
instability, cell  cycle arrest, and apoptosis.5 It is thought that PARP inhibitors utilize the 
homologous recombination  6 deficiency in BRCA-deficient cells to cause an increase in 
persistent single  strand breaks (SSBs), resulting in collapsed replication forks and 
ultimately creating  double strand breaks (DSB).2,7 HR-deficient cells are unable to 
maintain the  integrity of the genome and become nonviable. PARP inhibitors have now 
demonstrated efficacy for the  treatment of ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations.8,9 
Identification of  other mediators of cellular response to PARP inhibitors may reveal 
additional patient  populations that could benefit from this therapeutic approach.
1.3 Tumors  with BRCA-like gene defects as a distinct entity: 
We have queried a publicly  available database (COSMIC) to obtain the overall frequency 
of mutations of DNA repair genes. We demonstrated that DNA repair genes are mutated 
at the average frequency of 5% across various tumor types. As with ALK rearranged non-
small cell lung cancer, these unique subgroup of patients make up a molecularly defined 
rare group of cancer. It is well known that germ-line mutations in DNA repair pathway 
genes have been associated with various hereditary cancer syndromes. BRCA 1/2 
mutated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is a prime example. 
There are  a number of solid tumors that harbor defects in homologous recombination 
repair outside of BRCA 1/2 that are referred to as “BRCA-like” tumors or possessing 
“BRCAness.”10 Loss or disruption of proteins necessary for HR such as RAD51, ATM, 
ATR, CHK1, CHK2, FANCD2, and FANCA are observed in a variety of tumors. In 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer, patients with tumors with mutations in DNA repair genes 
such as ATM, ERCC2, FANCD2, PALB2, BRCA1, or BRCA2 demonstrated better 
survival outcome after cystectomy compared to patients with tumors without mutations. In 
pancreatic cancer, genomic instability co-segregated with inactivation of DNA repair 
genes including ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2. The individuals with defects in these 
DNA repair mechanisms demonstrated better treatment responses. These observations 
suggest that somatic mutations in HR DNA repair pathway genes may form a distinct 
entity across different histologies.
Recently it  has been shown that BRCA1/2-mutated tumors were associated with 
significantly higher CD8+/CD4+ ratio of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and 
significantly higher peritumoral T cells. These findings support an additional mechanism 
for the improved survival of patients with BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancers in addition to 
increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy11.

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 121.4 Rationale of  PARP inhibitors in BRCA like tumors: 
It is  expected that tumors displaying inherent or acquired DNA repair defects would most 
likely respond to PARP inhibition12. Ongoing research suggests HR deficiency, rather 
than a specific mutation in the BRCA genes, may be the main driver of cytotoxicity of 
PARP inhibition.13 The BRCA-like behavior has been described based on clinical and 
molecular features that parallel germline BRCA mutation-associated cancer 
characteristics. The major clinical BRCA-like behavior identified is susceptibility to 
platinum compounds and other DNA-damaging agents.14,15 
Recent trial (ARIEL2) in ovarian  cancer demonstrated that a use of PARP inhibitor 
(rucaparib) was associated with higher PFS rates among patients with BRCA mutations 
and BRCA-like wild-type ovarian cancer compared to biomarker-negative tumors. The 
median PFS for mutation carriers was not reached after 9.4 months, compared with 7.1 
months for patients with BRCA-like tumors and 3.7 months for participants who were 
biomarker negative16. There are also ongoing efforts to develop a predictive genomic 
companion diagnostics of HR deficiency that can help determine potential patients who 
would benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment.
1.5 Overall somatic  mutation burden of tumor and defects in DNA repair mechanisms: 
Mutations in  critical genes such as those involved in DNA repair will likely result in 
genomic instability and subsequent hypermutability. For example, it is well known that 
mismatch repair (MMR) deficient tumors have extremely high mutation rates. Similarly, in 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer, mutations in either of the DNA repair genes (ATM, 
ERCC2, FANCD2, PALB2, BRCA1, or BRCA2) were associated with higher somatic 
mutation burden as measured by non-synonymous single nucleotide variant (SNV) and 
higher T cell clonality as measured by lower T cell receptor (TCR) diversity index. This 
hypermutable state generated by defects in the DNA repair mechanism may be 
responsible for altering the tumor ‘mutanome’, resulting in the production of highly tumor-
specific mutated ‘neo-antigens’, potentially increasing the efficacy of immunotherapies.17 
Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from adoptive cell transfer-treated melanoma 
patients were found to show specificity for mutated tumor proteins, and further screening 
to estimate their ability to bind T cell major histocompatibility complex positively 
correlated with tumor regression. In multiple tumor types, immunogenicity of mutated 
tumor neo-antigens correlated with patient survival and increased TILs. Patients with 
MMR deficient colorectal cancer as well as MMR deficient non-colorectal cancers treated 
with PD-1 inhibitors have demonstrated better response compared with patients MMR 
proficient tumors. Furthermore, in ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer 
(TNBC) where BRCA1 or 2 mutations are more prevalent than other subtypes, favorable 
responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors have also been reported. 
1.6 Veliparib
1.6.1 Clinical  development of Veliparib
Veliparib is  a novel small molecule that is a potent inhibitor of PARP-1 and 
PARP-2 (Investigator's Brochure; edition 9 – 12 June 2015). PARPs are 
enzymes involved in DNA repair. In cells under oxidative stress, veliparib inhibits 
the PARP induced formation of poly-(ADP-ribose) (PAR). In cellular assays, 
veliparib increases sensitivity of tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents including 
platinum agents, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, temozolomide (TMZ) and 
radiation. In preclinical tumor models, veliparib enhances the anti-tumor efficacy 
of DNA crosslinking agents (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating/methylating agents 
(TMZ, cyclophosphamide), topoisomerase inhibitors (irinotecan) and radiation. 
Veliparib has been shown to enhance the efficacy of carboplatin in several 
xenograft tumor models. In the BRCA1 deficient MX-1 model, veliparib 
administered at doses as low as 25 mg/kg/day significantly enhanced the efficacy

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 13of carboplatin.  (Investigator's Brochure; edition 9 – 12 June 2015)
Veliparib is  being investigated in AbbVie-sponsored studies, in Investigator 
initiated
studies (IIS), and in  CTEP-sponsored studies. In these studies, veliparib is 
administered as monotherapy, combined with a variety of chemotherapeutic 
agents, including alkylating agents, platinums, and topoisomerase inhibitors, and 
radiation or combined with radiation therapy across an array of tumor types, 
including melanoma, glioma, prostate, breast, and colon. 
1.6.2 Clinical efficacy  of Veliparib
Summary preliminary or final efficacy  data from AbbVie sponsored studies have 
shown that veliparib has activity in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A phase II study evaluating veliparib in the 
treatment of persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer in patients who carry a germline BRCA1or BRCA2 mutation 
showed a response rate of 26% (90% CI: 16%-38%, CR: 2, PR: 11); for 
platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive patients the proportion responding was 
20% and 35%, respectively.9 Data from non-AbbVie sponsored studies show 
veliparib has activity as monotherapy for treatment of ovarian cancer18 and 
activity in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel for treatment of early breast 
cancer.19 Veliparib is currently in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development in 
combination with several DNA-damaging agents across a variety of cancer 
indications including a planned combination of Nivolumab in NSCLC.
1.6.3 Clinical safety  of Veliparib
In the veliparib  clinical development program, veliparib has been administered as 
monotherapy and as combination therapy to subjects with various solid tumors. 
Veliparib has been administered in doses up to 500 mg BID as monotherapy and 
up to 400 mg BID in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapies or radiation 
therapy. (Investigator's Brochure; edition 9 – 12 June 2015). The overall safety 
experience with veliparib, as monotherapy or in combination with other 
therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 3700 subjects treated to 
date (of which approximately 250 patients treated with single agent veliparib). 
Some of the common side effects with veliparib monotherapy (≥10%) include 
constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, dysguesia, feeling 
dizzy, sleep disturbance; Gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation; hematological toxicity such as anemia, leucopenia and 
thrombocytopenia; increased liver enzymes and blood sugars. Less frequent 
(<10%), but potentially severe events included dehydration and seizures. Very 
rare side effects include secondary malignancy (<1%) and Myelodysplastic 
syndrome (<0.1%), however were not seen in veliparib monotherapy studies. 
1.7 Nivolumab
1.7.1 Clinical development of  Nivolumab
Nivolumab (BMS-936558, MDX-1106)  is a fully human monoclonal 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody (HunMab) that is specific for human 
programmed death-1 (PD-1, cluster of differentiation 279 [cd279]) cell surface 
membrane receptor (Investigator Brochure version 2014). PD-1, a 55-kDa type 1 
transmembrane protein, is a member of the CD28 family of T-cell co-stimulatory 
receptors that include Ig super family member CD28, CTLA-4, inducible co-
stimulator (ICOS), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). PD-1 is a 
negative regulatory molecule that is expressed transiently following T-cell 
activation and on chronically stimulated T cells characterized by an “exhausted” 
phenotype. Nivolumab anti-tumor activity has been investigated in patients with 
melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 14PD-1 knockout  mice develop strain-specific lupus-like glomerulonephritis 
(C57BL/6) and cardiomyopathy (BALB/c). In transplantable tumor models that 
expressed PD-1 and LAG-3 on tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells dual 
anti-LAG-3/anti-PD-1 antibody treatment cured most mice of established tumors 
that were largely resistant to single antibody treatment 21. Despite minimal 
immunopathologic sequelae in PD-1 and LAG-3 single knockout mice, dual 
knockout mice abrogated self-tolerance with resultant autoimmune infiltrates in 
multiple organs, leading to eventual lethality. PD-L1 expression is found on a 
number of tumors, and is associated with poor prognoses based on OS in many 
tumors, including melanoma, renal, esophageal, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, 
lung, and other cancers (Investigator Brochure version 2014) 22-28. 
Nivolumab has  been evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, other immunotherapy (such as ipilimumab), anti-
angiogenesis therapy, and targeted therapies in completed and ongoing BMS-
sponsored clinical trials in NSCLC, melanoma, RCC, hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies including colorectal cancer with 
microsatellite instability (MSI), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with an 
expanding group of indications (Investigator Brochure version 2014). Nivolumab 
is currently FDA approved for the treatment of patients with: (i) unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma and disease progression after ipilimumab and, if BRAF 
V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor; (ii) patients with metastatic squamous 
non-small cell lung cancer with progression on or after platinum-based 
chemotherapy.
1.7.2 Clinical  efficacy
Nivolumab has  demonstrated clinical activity as monotherapy and as 
combination therapy with ipilimumab in several tumor types, including RCC, 
melanoma, NSCLC, and some lymphomas. The majority of responses was 
durable and exceeded 6 months (Investigator Brochure version 2014). 
Nivolumab is being investigated both as monotherapy and in combination with 
chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and other immunotherapies. 
In a  phase 1 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg nivolumab doses) dose-escalation study the 3 
mg/kg dose was chosen for expanded cohorts. Among 236 patients, objective 
responses (ORs) (complete or partial responses [CR or PR]) were seen in 
NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC. ORs were observed at all doses. Median OS was 
16.8 months across doses and 20.3 months at the 3 mg/kg dose. Heavily 
pretreated patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab (1, 3, or 10mg/kg) 
achieved median OS across all dose cohorts of 9.9 months with response rates 
of 17% and median duration of response 17 months 29. In addition, responses 
were similar between both squamous and non-squamous carcinoma cohorts in 
this study. A subsequent phase 3 study compared nivolumab to docetaxel in 
second-line treatment setting of advanced squamous cell carcinoma among 272 
patients. Nivolumab arm demonstrated superior median OS (9 vs 6 months), 1 
year survival rate (42 vs 24%), response rates (20 vs 9%), and significantly lower 
rates of grade 3-4 treatment related adverse events (7 vs 55%) 30. These results 
supported the FDA approval of nivolumab for second-line treatment of advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma following treatment with platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
Nivolumab has  also clinically meaningful activity in RCC. A phase II study treated 
168 patients with advanced clear cell RCC with progression after agents 
targeting VEGF pathway at three doses of nivolumab (0.3, 2 and 10mg/kg) 31.

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 15Median overall  survival was 18, 25, and 24 months for the three dose cohorts, 
respectively. Response rates were in average 20% with only 11% incidence of 
grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events. In an advanced melanoma phase 1 
study, nivolumab and ipilimumab were administered IV every 3 weeks for 4 
doses followed by nivolumab alone every 3 weeks for 4 doses (concurrent 
regimen) 20. The combined treatment was subsequently administered every 12 
weeks for up to 8 doses. In a sequenced regimen, patients previously treated 
with ipilimumab received nivolumab every 2 weeks for up to 48 doses. In the 
concurrent regimen (53 patients), 53% of patients had an OR at doses 1 mg/kg 
nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, with tumor reduction of 80% or more 
(modified World Health Organization criteria). In the sequenced-regimen (33 
patients), the objective response rate (ORR) was 20%. These results 
demonstrate significant clinical activity of nivolumab across multiple histologies 
with favorable toxicity profile. 
1.7.3 Clinical  safety
The overall safety  experience with nivolumab, as monotherapy or in combination 
with other therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 4,000 subjects 
treated to date. For monotherapy, the safety profile is similar across tumor types. 
The only exception is pulmonary inflammation adverse events (AEs), which may 
be numerically greater in subjects with NSCLC, because in some cases, it can be 
difficult to distinguish between nivolumab-related and unrelated causes of 
pulmonary symptoms and radiographic changes. There is no pattern in the 
incidence, severity, or causality of AEs to nivolumab dose level. In several 
ongoing clinical trials, the safety of nivolumab in combination with other 
therapeutics such as ipilimumab, cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti-angiogenics, and 
targeted therapies is being explored. Most studies are ongoing and, as such, the 
safety profile of nivolumab combinations continues to evolve. The most advanced 
combination under development is nivolumab + ipilimumab in subjects with 
melanoma. Thus far, the combination of both agents results in a safety profile 
with similar types of AEs as either agent alone, but in some cases with a greater 
frequency 20. 
1.8 Rationale  for Nivolumab and Veliparib combination: 
Previous studies have  demonstrated that tumors with the highest genomic instability and 
somatic mutational burden, such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and bladder 
cancer have favorable responses with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (Figure 1). 
The widely acceptable hypothesis is that tumors with more mutations likely generate 
more neoepitopes, which can be recognized by tumor infiltrating T cells. Checkpoint 
blocking antibodies activate these T cells in vivo and induce anti-tumor immunity, thereby 
causing tumor responses.

Somatic
 mutation frequency and various tumor types
Higher genomic  instability may also predict response to PARP inhibitors. For instance, 
smokers with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that also had higher genomic 
mutational burden, showed better response to a PARP inhibitor compared with 
nonsmokers. Screening for defective DNA repair mechanisms may select patients with 
higher mutation burden who will likely respond to combination therapy.
In addition  to utilizing the concept of synthetic lethality by utilizing PARP inhibition in 
tumors with defects in selected DNA repair mechanisms, we hope to increase the 
genomic instability and mutational epitopes produced in these tumors, making them more 
susceptible to the immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. With the help of immunotherapy, 
durable responses likely difficult to achieve with targeted therapy with PARP inhibitors 
may be realized via functioning memory T cells targeting tumor mutanomes generated 
and activated by the immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
Recently, it  has been shown in a syngeneic murine model of BRCA-/- ovarian cancer that 
PARP inhibition (talazoparib) significantly increased the number of peritoneal CD8+ T 
cells and NK cells as well as their production of IFN-γ  and TNF-α32. This implies that 
PARP inhibition induces not only cancer cell-intrinsic apoptosis but also cancer cell-
extrinsic antitumor immune effects. This finding suggests possible synergistic effect of 
PARP inhibitor and immunotherapy in cancer. 
Nivolumab is  an immune checkpoint inhibitor to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) 
that is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma and metastatic squamous 
cell carcinoma of the lung. Veliparib is a PARP inhibitor that has shown promising activity 
in the treatment of germline BRCA1/2 mutated ovarian tumors. Given the non-
overlapping side effect profiles and different therapeutic targets of these agents, this 
combination of agents may improve efficacy without compromising toxicity. Compared to 
monotherapy with either of these agents, the combination approach may increase the 
ORR and survival outcome and possibly broaden number of tumor histologies and their 
subtypes that will respond to such treatment. Therefore, we propose a clinical trial with 
nivolumab and veliparib combination.
PARP inhibitor  monotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibition may each result in clinical 
responses in a select group of tumors, especially tumors that are characterized by the 
presence of high mutational burden.  Genomic instability due to mutations in DNA repair 
has been shown in both pre-clinical and clinical studies to predict response to PARP

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 17inhibitors  Immune checkpoint  inhibitors yield impressive clinical responses in melanoma 
and non-small cell lung cancer, two cancers with very high mutational loads   NSCLC that 
arise in smokers, the subset of lung tumors with the highest mutational load, are 
particularly susceptible to treatment with nivolumab or with veliparib .   Smokers with 
NSCLC treated with nivolumab had a significantly higher response rate and improved 
survival outcomes relative to non-smokers . Similar data showing RR, PFS, and OS 
improvements in subjects who smoke were recently published for veliparib .  
Advanced Solid Tumors and  Lymphoma Harboring Alterations in Selected DNA Repair 
Genes are a rational target for treatment with PARP inhibition with checkpoint inhibitors, 
because approximately 5% are defective in the homologous recombination DNA repair 
pathway due to germline, somatic and epigenetic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and, 
to a lesser extent, from mutations in other homologous repair proteins .  These 
indications therefore have an increased mutational load, suggesting a moderate amount 
of neoantigen derived from point mutations, which could be increased in the presence of 
PARP inhibition .
In pre-clinical  studies, PARP inhibitors are associated with immunomodulation. PARP 
inhibitors promote local antigen release after tumor exposure to radiation or DNA-
damaging agents, which may result in systemic antitumor response. . In a BRCA1-
mutated ovarian cancer xenograft model, PARP inhibition increased the number of 
peritoneal CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, and increased production of interferon γ 
and tumor necrosis factor α  . Though data from pre-clinical cancer models treated with 
combination PARP inhibition and checkpoint inhibition are limited, veliparib does not 
antagonize α-PD-1  in a MC-38 syngeneic mouse model (AbbVie Investigator’s Brochure, 
data on file).
Taken together,  these data suggest that PARP inhibition with veliparib may be 
complementary to immune checkpoint modulation with nivolumab in yielding clinical 
benefit in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphoma Harboring Alterations in 
Selected DNA Repair Genes
1.9 Rationale  for the current study design
The study  will be done in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma with or 
without identified mutations in specified DNA repair genes involved in homologous 
recombination repair pathway (only the expansion cohort will require such mutations). 
Therefore, it will be a multi-histology basket trial with a molecularly driven expansion 
cohort. The effect of veliparib monotherapy has been shown in germline BRCA1/2 
mutated ovarian cancer. Hence, this patient group will be excluded from the population. 
In addition to safety evaluation, this study is designed as a multi-histology navigation trial 
to explore the proof-of-principle in efficacy in this novel combination treatment in various 
cancer types that are refractory to standard of care treatment options. 
The initial  study design was to accrue a total of up to 50 patients (for 48 evaluable) to the 
study in two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. The original design 
anticipated enrolling 6-18 patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma in the dose 
escalation phase, followed by 15-32 patients in a two-stage expansion phase. For the dose 
escalation, a standard 3+3 design was chosen to determine the MTD of the novel 
combination To date, 9 patients have been enrolled and the dose escalation phase is 
complete, including 6 patients that were treated at the MTD of 400 mg BID. 
However, due to funding issues, the study will adopt a modified plan for the expansion 
cohort, and will perform an early analysis of preliminary efficacy after the next 6 patients are 
enrolled in the expansion cohort. 
This modified  plan for expansion cohort , will accrue 6 new patients with genetic

treated patients with genetic mutation will provide total of 6+4=10 patients, with genetic 
mutation. ORR will be computed at the first imaging (8 weeks). Preliminary efficacy will 
be evaluated by RECISTv 1.1. As exploratory analysis, irRECIST will be used to obtain 
preliminary efficacy as well.  All ORR will use the first imaging time point whether 
RECIST or irRECIST.
The study will be considered a success if the lower 90% exact confidence bound will 
be > 10% , i.e. if three or more successes out of n=10 are observed. 
. According to the modified plan for the current trial, the study will be closed after the 6 
additional patients will have been recruited.
This same  treatment plan will be used for patients in both the dose escalation and 
dose expansion cohorts.
. 
1.10 Rationale for  Dosing 
1.10.1 Nivolumab  flat dose regimen
The safety and  efficacy of 240 mg (monotherapy) Q2W flat dose of nivolumab 
has recently received IRB approval and is expected to be similar to the 3 mg/kg 
Q2W dosing regimen. Using the population PK (PPK) model, exposure of 
nivolumab at 240 mg flat doses is identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects 
weighing 80 kg, which is the approximate median body weight in nivolumab 
clinical trials. Across the various tumor types in the clinical program, nivolumab 
has been shown to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg, and 
the relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy 
and safety has been found to be relatively flat. Given the similarity of nivolumab 
PK across tumor types and the similar exposures predicted following 
administration of 240 mg flat doses compared to 1mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, it is 
expected that the safety and efficacy profile of 240 mg nivolumab will be similar 
to that of 3 mg/kg nivolumab. 
In addition,  nivolumab 480 mg administered once every 4 weeks (Q4W) is 
currently under investigation. The less frequent dosing regimen is designed to 
afford more convenience to the target patient populations. The nivolumab dose of 
480 mg Q4W was selected based on clinical data and modeling and simulation 
approaches using PPK and exposure-response analyses of data from studies in 
multiple tumor types (melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC) to provide an approximately 
equivalent dose of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. Exposures following nivolumab 480 
mg Q4W regimen are predicted to be within the exposure ranges observed at 
doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the nivolumab clinical program, and are not 
considered to put participants at increased risk. Hence, the flat doses of 240mg 
and 480mg nivolumab are under investigation.
1.10.2 Veliparib  Dosing
A veliparib dose  of 400mg po bid is the phase 2 recommended dose for veliparib 
monotherapy. A prior phase 1 study shows that it is safe to start at 300mg po bid 
in combination with nivolumab. Thus the dose escalation will begin at 300mg 
veliparib twice a day and escalate to a final dose level 2 of 400mg.

and without mutations in selected DNA repair genes, where the expansion cohort will be 
reserved for patients with DNA repair gene mutations as listed in 3.1.6.  This will be a single-
center trial conducted at Northwestern  University.
The initial  study design was to accrue a total of up to 50 patients for 48 evaluable) to the study in 
two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. The original design anticipated a total of 6-18 
patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma in the dose escalation phase; 9 patients were 
enrolled, including 3 at lowest dose and 6 that were treated at the MTD of 400 mg BID. It is still 
planned for 6 patients  with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma with mutations in selected DNA 
repair genes to be enrolled into the expansion cohort to receive the maximum tolerated dose of 
veliparib in combination with nivolumab . However, due to funding issues, the study will perform an 
early analysis of preliminary efficacy after the next 6 patients are enrolled in the expansion cohort, all with 
the genetic mutation. . According to the modified plan for the current trial, the study will be closed after the 
6 additional patients will have been recruited.
 
Approximately 5  potentially eligible  patients will be seen per month,  and it is anticipated that at 
least 2 per month will be accrued. Patients will be recruited by all participating investigators in

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 244.1 Overview
In Phase 1, patients will  be treated with a dose escalation plan for veliparib based on 
a 3+3 study design. The initial patient cohort will be treated with veliparib 300 mg PO 
twice daily and nivolumab as follows (1 cycle = 28 days):
Cycle 1-4 : 240 mg IV every 2 weeks and 
Cycle 5+ : 480mg IV every 4 weeks 
See section  4.2 for treatment administration and dosing modifications based on the 
planned 3+3 study design. Total cycle length is 28 days (4 weeks). Combination 
treatment will continue until progression of disease or intolerability with scans 
occurring every 8 weeks (see section 4.7.1 for possible treatment beyond progression). 
Patients in the expansion cohort (Phase1B) will be treated with the MTD, that is now 
established. This same treatment plan will be used for patients in both the dose 
escalation and dose expansion cohorts. 
Patients will  undergo a fresh tissue biopsy prior to study enrollment, unless deemed to 
be clinically inappropriate per PI, to evaluate  pharmacodynamic changes in immune-
related biomarkers.  Correlatives  will be assessed as detailed in section 9.0.
[Please note: . According to the modified plan for the current trial, the study will be closed 
after the 6 additional patients in the expansion cohort will have been recruited.]

Nivolumab 
(Opdivo)C1-4: 240mg
C5+: 480mgIV Cycle 1-4 : every 14 days 
Cycle 5+ : every 28 days until progression 
of disease, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal 
of consent
Veliparib Phase I:  Starting 
dose 300mg (see 
4.3 for escalation)
Phase Ib:  MTDPO Twice a  day about 12 hours apart starting 
7 days before C1D1 (Induction 
monotherapy) continuing until progression 
of disease, intolerable toxicity, or 
withdrawal of consent
4.2.1 Veliparib
Veliparib is  administered orally twice a day starting on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Subjects will self-administer the morning and evening doses of veliparib 
approximately 12 hours apart in the same calendar day.  Each dose of veliparib 
will be taken with a glass of water and consumed over as short a time as 
possible (i.e., not slower than 1 capsule every 2 minutes) with or without food. 
During veliparib treatment, standard  antiemetic therapy may be administered as 
appropriate, including a combination of standard antiemetic’s (i.e., 5-HT3 
receptor antagonists, steroids, and prochlorperazine, and/or promethazine).
It is  recommended that if a subject misses a scheduled dose of veliparib and less 
than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the dose should be 
immediately taken.  It is recommended that if more than 6 hours have passed 
since the scheduled dosing time, the subject should not take the missed dose but 
should wait and take the next regularly scheduled dose.
If the  subject vomits within 15 minutes of taking veliparib, another dose will be 
administered.  The dose may only be repeated once.  If more than 15 minutes 
has passed from the time of oral dosing then no additional doses will be taken.

drug diaries will be returned at the beginning of each cycle along with any 
leftover veliparib tablets and drug bottles.
See section 4.3  for details on dose escalation during Phase I and section 4.4 for 
toxicity management 
4.2.2. Nivolumab
During Cycle  1-4, nivolumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 240 mg 
intravenously over approximately 30 minutes (-5 / +15 minutes) every 2 weeks 
(Day 1 and 15 of each cycle). Starting with Cycle 5, nivolumab will be 
administered at 480mg IV over 30 minutes (-10 / +15 minutes) every 4 weeks 
(Day 1 of each cycle). There is no premedication required for infusion. Veliparib 
oral doses can be taken independently of the nivolumab administration schedule.
4.2.2.1 Treatment  Monitoring
Subjects will be  monitored before, during,  and after the 30- or 60-
minute infusion  of nivolumab with vital signs as follows:
Table 4.2:  Time Points for Vital Signs 
Before Infusion
Pre-dose Vitals up  to 30 minutes prior
During Infusion
Every 15  minutes Vitals ±  5 minutes
After infusion
Immediately following Vitals within  5 minutes after
30 minutes  post Vitals ±  5 minutes
60 minutes  post (1st & 2nd 
doses)Vitals ±  5 minutes
3 hour  observation (1st dose 
only)Observation only
In the  event of a Grade ≤ 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate 
of nivolumab may be decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution 
of the event  (up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 50% of the initial rate 
until completion of the infusion. In subjects  experiencing Grade ≤ 2 
infusion-related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered 
at 50% of the initial  rate. Acetaminophen  and/or an antihistamine (eg, 
diphenhydramine) may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator. If the infusion-related reaction is severe or prolonged, 
methylprednisolone 125 mg (or the equivalent) should be 
administered as well. Investigators may administer  steroids  at their 
discretion as clinically indicated  and per their institution’s guidelines. 
Appropriate drugs  and medical equipment  to treat acute anaphylactic 
reactions  must be immediately  available,  and study personnel  must  
be trained to recognize  and treat anaphylaxis.

The above  dose escalation plan is based on a 3 + 3 design with the starting dose of 
veliparib as 300 mg PO twice daily and nivolumab as 240mg IV every 2 weeks. Each 
cycle will be 28 days (4 weeks) in length.  
4.3.1 Definition of DLT (Dose  limiting toxicity)
Toxicity will  be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03 unless otherwise 
specified. A DLT is defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory value assessed as 
at least possibly related to the study medication, occurs ≤ 28 days following the 
first dose of veliparib and nivolumab and meets any of the criteria listed below. 
Whenever a patient experiences toxicity that fulfills the criteria for a DLT, 
treatment with the study drug combination will be interrupted until resolution to ≤ 
Grade 1 or baseline, and the toxicity will be followed up until resolution. All 
adverse events specified below will be DLT’s except those that are clearly and 
incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes. 
The following  events will be considered DLT’s:
1. Grade  ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicities that represent at least a 2-grade 
increase from baseline with the following exceptions:
a. Nausea,  vomiting, and diarrhea lasting ≤48 hours
b. Electrolyte  abnormalities resolving within ≤24 hours
c. Hypersensitivity  reactions
d. Alopecia 
2. Grade  4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25.0 x 109/L)
3. Grade  3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding (platelets <50.0 x 109/L)
4. Grade  4 neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L)
5. Grade  3 febrile neutropenia with fever lasting for > 7 days
6. Grade  4 febrile neutropenia of any duration 
7. Dosing delay  due to toxicity for > 14 consecutive days from the date 
nivolumab or veliparib is due.

Initial Version  Date: October 6, 2016
Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 27*If dose  escalation is stopped at dose level 2, dose level 1 will be 
established as the MTD if it enrolled 6 patients (<2 of 6 patients had 
DLT). If dose level 1 enrolled only 3 patients (0 of 3 had DLT’s), 3 more 
patients will be added to dose level 1 to establish the MTD. From there, 
dose level -1 will be utilized in the case that ≥2 patients have DLT.
NOTE: Whichever  dose level is declared the MTD must have 6 total 
patients treated at that level. For example, if 3 patients are treated at level 2 
and 0 patients experience DLT, escalation would then proceed to level 3. 
However, if ≥ 2 patients at level 3 experience DLT, enrollment to level 2 
would need to be re-opened to enroll an additional 3 patients at that level 
(with 0 or 1 DLT observed in 6 total patients) in order to declare level 2 the 
MTD.
4.3.3 Dose  expansion: 
The initial  study design was to accrue a total of up to 50 patients (for 48 evaluable) to 
the study in two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. The original design 
anticipated a total of 6-18 patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma in the dose 
escalation phase.9 patients were enrolled, including 6 that were treated at the MTD of 400 
mg BID. 
However, due to funding issues, the study will adopt a modified plan for the expansion 
cohort, and will perform an early analysis of preliminary efficacy after the next 6 patients are 
enrolled in the expansion cohort.
This modified  plan for expansion cohort , will accrue 6 new patients with genetic 
alteration for early preliminary efficacy assessment, which together with 4 previously 
treated patients with genetic mutation will provide total of 6+4=10 patients, with genetic 
mutation. ORR will be computed at the first imaging (8 weeks). Preliminary efficacy will 
be evaluated by RECISTv 1.1. As exploratory analysis, irRECIST will be used to obtain 
preliminary efficacy as well.  All ORR will use the first imaging time point whether 
RECIST or irRECIST.
Patients in this cohort will be treated at the MTD and the same treatment schedule will be 
followed as was done in the escalation phase. 
The study will be considered a success if the lower 90% exact confidence bound will be > 
10% , i.e. if three or more successes out of n=10 are observed. 
 According to the modified plan for the current trial, the study will be closed after the 6 
additional patients will have been recruited. 
4.4 Toxicity  Management & Dose Delays/Modifications
Each patient  will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the timeframe  
referenced in Table 5. Toxicity will be assessed  according to the NCI CTCAE V4.03.
Veliparib doses  may be reduced or delayed up to 28 days according to Table 4.3 and 
the toxicity management guidelines in Table 4.5. Missed doses will be skipped with each 
cycle continuing as originally planned. 
Nivolumab doses  cannot be modified but can be delayed or discontinued according to 
Table 4.6. Missed doses will be skipped, resuming at the next scheduled treatment visit.

Abbvie Study Number: A15-831
 
Initial Version  Date: October 6, 2016
Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 28Since the mechanism  of action of nivolumab leads  to T-cell  activation and proliferation, 
immune related adverse events (irAE) may be observed, and be similar to that of other 
PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors,  and may include immune-mediated pneumonitis,   
enterocolitis, dermatitis,  hepatitis, and endocrinopathies.
Subjects should  be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs. In the absence of an 
alternate etiology (i.e. infection or PD), an immune-mediated etiology should be 
considered for signs or symptoms of pneumonitis, enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, 
and endocrinopathy. In addition to the dose modifications shown in Tables 4.4 and 
4.5, it is recommended that management of irAEs follow the guidelines outlined for 
other immune checkpoint inhibitors. These guidelines recommend  the following:
Subjects should be evaluated to identify  any alternative etiology
In the absence of clear alternative  etiology,  all events of an inflammatory 
nature  should be considered  to be immune-related
Topical or inhaled steroid therapy should be considered for low-grade events
Systemic corticosteroids should be considered for a persistent low-grade  event  
or for a severe event
More potent  immunosuppressives  (i.e. infliximab,  mycophenolate mofetil, 
etc.) should be considered  for events not responding  to systemic steroids
If the investigator  has any question in regards  to an AE being an irAE, the investigator  
should immediately contact the principal investigator.  Treatment modifications will not be 
required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to investigational drugs (such as an accident)  
or for laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be clinically significant.
Nausea and  vomiting have been commonly observed in clinical trials with veliparib.
Gastrointestinal toxicities,  predominantly nausea and vomiting, were observed with 
veliparib as single-agent therapy and most frequently reported at higher doses (300 – 
400 mg BID). Of the subjects treated with single agent veliparib at 300 – 400 mg BID 
dose levels, 15% required dose reduction, 5% delayed or interrupted dosing and 2% 
discontinued due to nausea.  To optimize dose intensity and maintain subject quality of 
life, early initiation or prophylactic management with scheduled anti-emetic therapy (5HT-
3 antagonists, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) and/or lorazepam should be 
considered. In addition, it has also been observed that tolerance to these toxicities may 
develop over time. Management should include counseling regarding these toxicities and 
may include interruption of dosing, dose modification or veliparib discontinuation.
Treatment modifications  may be required in the event of treatment-related toxicity.  General  
guidelines regarding  treatment modification are provided in Table 4.5 and 4.6.  Dose 
modifications  should be implemented  only if toxicities are attributed to 
respective drugs  (nivolumab or veliparib). If there is uncertainty or 
overlapping toxicities, both drugs should be held and or dose modified 
according to the guidelines.
All toxicities will  be graded according to NCI CTCAE V4.03  (Appendix B).
Should a  female patient become pregnant  or suspect  she is pregnant while  participating in 
this study,  she should inform her treating physician immediately. Similarly if a male patient 
impregnates a female, the treating physician should be informed.

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 29Subjects should  have an ANC ≥ 1,500/mm3 and a platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 
prior to each cycle.
For any  subject who experiences Grade 3 or 4 toxicity despite optimal supportive 
care (with the exception of anemia, alopecia, and non-treatment related clinically 
insignificant laboratory abnormalities), and the toxicity is not attributable to 
underlying disease, the veliparib dose will be held until the toxicity resolves to 
Grade 1 or lower or to baseline if Grade 2 is present at the time of study entry.
Interruptions of veliparib for  events that are clearly not related to therapy (e.g., 
underlying cancer, planned surgical procedures, or acute viral illnesses), do not 
necessitate a dose reduction.
The dose  of veliparib will be managed according to Table 4.5 below, and the

Nausea 5-HT3 antagonists  (ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron), dopamine antagonists 
(prochlorperazine, metoclopramide) and lorazepam were most frequently used to 
manage veliparib-associated nausea. Anti-emetics should be initially prescribed on 
a specified schedule (e.g., no PRN). Multiple concomitant anti-emetic medications 
may be needed in some cases for effective nausea management. Example 
regimens and combinations to consider include: 
○ Ondansetron  4 or 8 mg BID 
○ Lorazepam  0.5 mg Q8H 
○ Ondansetron  8 MG Q8H; prochlorperazine 10 MG Q6H 
○ Lorazepam  1 mg Q8H; prochlorperazine 10 mg Q6H; ondansetron 8 mg Q8H

Initial Version  Date: October 6, 2016
Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 31Toxicity Grade Dose Adjustment  and Management 
Recommendations
In addition  to the use of anti-emetic medications, investigators should rely on 
standard clinical practice and local/country guidelines for nausea management. 
Patients should be proactively counseled about adherence to the prescribed 
supportive care.
Dose Interruptions  
Nausea related  to veliparib can be managed with dose interruptions, if it is not 
responsive to anti-emetic therapy. Due to the half-life of veliparib of approximately 4 
– 6 hours, symptom improvement/resolution typically occurs within 1 to 3 days of 
treatment interruption. If no improvement of symptoms is observed within this time 
frame, relationship of the event to veliparib should be re-evaluated. 
Dose Reductions  
Subjects experiencing  nausea at the initial dose level that cannot be controlled with 
anti-emetics should be dose reduced. If the subject was receiving anti-emetics at 
the initial veliparib dose level, it is also recommended that the same anti-emetic 
regimen be continued at the reduced veliparib dose level until symptom resolution or 
significant improvement. Dose reductions to below 200 mg BID are not expected to 
be necessary. 
If nausea does  not improve sufficiently at the reduced dose, further dose reduction 
to the next lower dose level is recommended. Interruption of veliparib dosing may be 
attempted to determine if nausea is indeed related to veliparib.
Grade Dose Adjustment  and Management Recommendations
1 No dose  adjustment required. Initiate appropriate medical therapy and 
monitor.
2 -Dose interruption for  up to 28 days until recovery to ≤ Grade 1. Initiate 
appropriate medical therapy and monitor.
-Re-initiate veliparib  at the same dose
-If the  same toxicity recurs at Grade 2, interrupt until recovery to ≤ Grade 
1. Re-inititate veliparib at the next lower dose level.
3 -Dose interruption for  up to 28 daysuntil recovery to ≤ Grade 1. Initiate 
appropriate medical therapy and monitor.
-Re-initiate veliparib  at the same dose
-If the  same toxicity recurs at Grade 2, interrupt until recovery to ≤ Grade 
1. Re-inititate veliparib at the next lower dose level.

Immune-  mediated  peripheral  neuromotor  syndromes,  such  as Guillain-Barre  and Myasthenia  Gravis
Grade Dose  Modifications Toxicity Management
Any 
GradeThe prompt  diagnosis  of immune-mediated  peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important,  since certain subjects may 
unpredictably experience acute  decompensations which can 
result  in substantial morbidity or in the worst  case,  death.  Special 
care should be taken for certain  sentinel symptoms which  may 
predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent  dysphagia,  
rapidly progressive  weakness,  and signs of respiratory  
insufficiency or autonomic instability

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 38Subjects  should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology 
(e.g., disease  progression,  infections,  metabolic  syndromes and 
medications,  etc.). It should  be noted that the diagnosis  of 
immune-  mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes  can be 
particularly challenging in subjects  with underlying cancer, due to 
the multiple  potential confounding effects of cancer (and its 
treatments) throughout  the neuraxis.
oGiven  the importance  of prompt  and accurate diagnosis,  
it is essential  to have a low threshold to obtain  a 
neurological  consult
Neurophysiologic diagnostic  testing (e.g.,  electromyogram and 
nerve conduction  investigations,  and “repetitive stimulation”  if 
myasthenia is suspected) are routinely  indicated upon suspicion 
of such conditions  and may be best facilitated by means of a 
neurology consultation
Important  to consider that the use of steroids as the primary 
treatment of Guillain-Barre is not typically  considered  effective.  
Subjects requiring treatment  should be considered for 
plasmapheresis (or IVIgG,  as an alternative)

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS
oSteroids  may be successfully used  to treat Myasthenia 
Gravis.  Important to consider that steroid  therapy 
(especially with high doses) may result in transient  
worsening of myasthenia and should typically  be 
administered in a monitored setting under  supervision of 
a consulting  neurologist.
oSubjects  unable to tolerate steroids  may be candidates for 
treatment  with plasmapheresis or IVIgG.  Such decisions 
are best made in consultation with a neurologist,  taking 
into account the unique  needs of each patient.
oIf  Myasthenia Gravis-like  neurotoxicity present, consider  
starting acetylcholine esterase  17 inhibitor therapy in 
addition to steroids.  Such therapy,  if successful,  can also 
serve to reinforce the diagnosis.

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 414.6 Concomitant Medications/Treatments
The investigator must  be informed  as soon as possible about any medication taken  
from the time of screening until the end of the clinical  phase of the study (final study 
visit).  Any concomitant  medication(s), taken during  the study will be recorded.
Investigators may prescribe  concomitant  medications or treatments (eg, 
acetaminophen,  diphenhydramine) deemed necessary to provide adequate  
prophylactic or supportive  care except for those medications identified as “excluded” as 
listed in the bulleted  list below.  Patients may continue baseline medications that were 
initially deemed appropriate  by the investigator at screening.
Subjects must  be instructed not to  take any medications, including over-the-counter  
products, without  first consulting with the investigator.
The following medications  are considered  exclusionary  during the study:
•Any investigational  anticancer  therapy (within 28 days prior to registration)
•Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except palliative radiotherapy on 
non-target lesions only),  immunotherapy,  biologic or hormonal therapy  for cancer 
treatment. (within 14 days prior to registration, 28 days for systemic 
chemotherapy)
•Immunosuppressive medications including,  but not limited to systemic  
corticosteroids at doses not exceeding  10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent,  
methotrexate, azathioprine, and TNF-alpha blockers. Use of immunosuppressive 
medications for the management of investigational  product-related AEs or in 
subjects with contrast  allergies is acceptable.  In addition,  use of inhaled and 
intranasal corticosteroids is permitted.  Temporary courses of corticosteroids for 
treatment of underlying  or concurrent illness  or in the setting of palliative 
radiotherapy may be permitted  upon discussion with the PI.
•Live attenuated  vaccines during  the study within 28 days prior to registration 
through 180 days after the last dose of both drugs
•Herbal and natural  remedies  (within 14 days prior to registration)
4.7 Duration  of Therapy (for both dose- escalation and dose- expansion phase)
Patients may continue  with  treatment until any of the following occur:
Disease progression, unless the patient meets criteria for continuing treatment 
beyond progression. See section 4.7.1 for details.
Development  of an inter-current illness that prevents further  administration 
of treatment
Unacceptable adverse event(s)
Patient  decides  to withdraw from either study treatment or the study as a whole 
The treating investigator determines that the patient should be taken off treatment 
for any reason (i.e. changes in condition,  inability to comply with study treatment 
or procedures)

Initial Version  Date: October 6, 2016
Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 42In the event of  an initial assessment of PD (based on RECIST Version 1.1), a 
subject may continue to receive the assigned study treatment as long as none 
of the criteria listed below are met.
1. Confirmed  PD: An initial assessment of PD by RECIST 1.1 or Lugano 
criteria will be confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor 
assessment time point, but no sooner than 4 weeks later (see section 
6.1.7 & Appendix C, respectively). If any subsequent tumor assessment 
shows progression per RECIST v1.1 or Lugano criteria in the overall 
tumor burden (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), 
when compared to the initial PD assessment (the sum of diameters of 
target lesions and new lesions), then PD is confirmed.
2. Meets any of  the other investigational product discontinuation criteria 
(Section 4.6) 
3. Clinical  symptoms or signs indicating significant PD, for example the 
benefit-risk ratio of continuing therapy is no longer justified. 
4. Decline  in ECOG performance status.
5. Threat  to vital organs/critical anatomical sites (e.g., spinal cord 
compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention, and 
continuation of study therapy would prevent institution of such 
intervention.
4.8 Duration  of Follow  Up (for both dose- escalation and dose- expansion phase)
After patients come off  treatment they will be followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12 months and 
then every 6 months  for 3 years (from the start of the treatment) for survival and 
progression of disease via either clinic visits or phone calls. 
4.9 Removal  of Subjects from Study Treatment and/or Study  as a Whole
(for both dose- escalation and dose- expansion phase)
Patients can be taken  off the study treatment and/or study as a whole at any time at 
their own request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for 
safety,  behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation must  
be clearly  documented on the appropriate eCRF and may include:
Patient  voluntarily withdraws from treatment (follow-up permitted)
Patient  withdraws consent (no follow-up permitted)
Patient  is unable to comply with protocol  requirements
Patient  demonstrates disease progression
Patient  experiences  unacceptable toxicity
Treating physician determines that continuation on the study would not be in 
the patient’s best interest
Patient  becomes  pregnant
Patient  develops a second  malignancy  that requires treatment which would 
interfere  with this study
Patient  becomes  lost to follow-up (LTF)
Patients who  are permanently discontinued from receiving investigational product will 
be followed for disease progression and safety,  including  the collection of any 
protocol-  specified  blood specimens, unless consent  is withdrawn or the subject is lost 
to follow-up  or administered subsequent therapy.  All subjects will be followed for 
survival and disease  progression.  Subjects who decline  to return  to the site for 
evaluations will be offered  follow-up by phone every 3 months as an alternative.

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 45f. CBC:  Performed pre-dose at each treatment visit (Day 1 & 15 of Cycles 1-4, and Day 1 of Cycle 5+). For patients experiencing significant drop in WBCs 
or platelets felt related to treatment, CBCs should be obtained more frequently (weekly or more frequently) to assess timing for retreatment or need for 
transfusion support.
g. Serum  or urine test only for women of childbearing potential; must be tested within 7 days prior to registration as well as C1D1 (within 24 hours prior to 
nivolumab treatment).
h.Thyroid function  tests will include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with reflexfree T4. This will be done at baseline then only as clinically indicated 
thereafter. 
i.PT/INR is required at baseline (≤  28 days prior to registration) for patients on anticoagulants.
j.Imaging (either CT scan or MRI and PET if applicable) will be performed at screening, ≤28 days prior to registration. The same  modality used  at baseline  
should be used throughout for imaging. CT imaging will include chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Neck will be included only if measurable lesions are present. 
Scans will then take place every 2 cycles (8 weeks) starting with Cycle 3 Day 1 (- 7 days). Tumor measurements will be performed using RECIST 1.1 or 
Lugano classification. Progressive Disease (PD) must be confirmed by repeat scan within 8 weeks.
k.Patients will undergo a fresh tissue biopsy prior to study enrollment, unless deemed to be clinically inappropriate per PI. If a fresh biopsy is not feasible, an 
archival tissue sample should be obtained (a cell block is preferred, however 15 unstained slides will suffice). Tissue should be obtained by any means 
possible, but patients will not be excluded from the study if tissue is not available. The samples will be obtained for correlative studies – see section 9.0 and 
separate lab manual for details. 
l. Study  labs will be collected for tumor markers pre-dose on Induction Day 1, C1D1, C3D1, and at the End of Treatment visit. See section 9.0 and separate 
lab manual for more details.
m. Nivolumab  will be administered as follows:
Cycles 1-4 : given at a fixed dose of 240mg IV over 30 minutes (-5 / +15 minutes) every 2 weeks
Starting with Cycle  5 Day 1: 480mg IV over 30 minutes (-10 / +15 minutes) every 4 weeks until disease progression, intolerability, or withdrawal of 
consent. 
Vital signs  will be monitored prior to, throughout, and after the nivolumab infusion according to Table 4.2.
n. Veliparib  will be taken orally at the assigned dose twice a day until disease progression, intolerability, or withdrawal of consent. It will be initiated as 
monotherapy during a 7-day induction period. Starting with Cycle 1 Day 1, veliparib will be given twice daily in combination with scheduled nivolumab 
infusions. Veliparib may be taken with or without food. Patients will be given a drug diary to maintain for compliance. Veliparib dosing may take place 
independently of nivolumab. On the day of a study visit, lab values should be checked against sections 4.4 and 4.5 for continued dosing.
o. The end  of treatment visit should occur 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (± 7 days) or before starting another line of treatment, whichever 
comes first. 
p. After  patients come off treatment they will be followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and then every 6 months for 3 years for survival and progression of 
disease via either clinic visits or phone calls.
q. Adverse  events will be followed from the time of consent until 30 days after treatment discontinuation (100 days for SAE’s).
r. For  patients in the expansion phase of the study, mutation testing is required within 1 year of registration (see 3.1.6 for details)

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 466.0 ENDPOINT  ASSESSMENT
6.1 Solid tumors
6.1.1Response will be evaluated using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors, based on RECIST v1.1.35
6.1.2Clinical evaluation and tumor assessments will be performed as indicated in Table 6, 
based on physical examination and radiologic evaluation. 
6.1.3Any lesion that has been previously treated with radiotherapy should be considered 
as a non-target lesion. However, if a lesion previously treated with radiotherapy has 
clearly progressed since the radiotherapy, it can be considered as a target lesion.
6.1.4Definitions for measurable and non-measurable lesions, and criteria for response, 
should be based on RECIST v1.1.
6.1.5Measurable Disease
Measurable lesions  are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) by 
chest x-ray or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. 
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).
6.1.6Non-measurable Disease
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 
mm [≥1 to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal 
masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable. 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-
measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
6.1.7Response criteria
Complete  Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in 
short axis to <10mm.
Partial  Response  (PR) - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Objective  Response Rate – the sum of complete responses and partial 
responses 
Progressive Disease  (PD) - At least  a 20% increase in the sum of diameters 
of target  lesions,  taking  as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes 
the baseline sum if that is the smallest  on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate an absolute  increase of at 
least  5 mm. (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered  progression.)
Stable Disease  (SD) - Neither sufficient shrinkage  to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify  for PD, taking as reference  the smallest  sum of 
diameters while on study.

6.2.1Response will be evaluated, using the Lugano classification for assessment of 
Lymphoma.36 See Appendix C for specific response assessment criteria.
6.2.2Clinical evaluation and tumor assessments will be performed periodically, as shown 
in Table 6, based on evaluation of spleen and liver, physical examination for 
superficial disease and B symptoms, radiologic evaluation, and appropriate 
laboratory studies.
6.2.3A lesion is categorized based on the location as either a nodal lesion or an 
extranodal lesion if it is located in organs other than lymph nodes or nodal mass, but 
including spleen and liver.
6.2.4All tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable 
as follows:
• Measurable  nodal and extranodal lesions:
A lesion  will be called measurable if it can be measured accurately in 2 
perpendicular dimensions and:
-For nodal  lesion, if the long axis is >15 mm, regardless of the length of the 
short axis
-For extranodal lesion,  if the long and short axes are ≥10 mm.
Patients should  have at least one measurable nodal lesion greater than 20 
mm in the long axis.
In cases where the  patient has no measurable nodal lesions greater than 20 
mm in the long axis at screening, then the patient must have at least one 
measurable extranodal lesion. 
6.2.5Classification of lymph nodes
• Lymph  nodes are classified according to their size and/or relationship to the 
disease:
-A lymph  node meeting the measurability requirement, but with long axis > 
15 mm (e.g. short axis cannot be measured accurately) will constitute a 
non-measurable nodal lesion.
-A lymph  node not meeting the measurability criteria, but with a size of 11 
mm to 15 mm in the long axis and >10 mm in the short axis will be checked 
for relationship to disease:
-If it  is thought to be disease related, it will constitute a non-
measurable nodal lesion
-If it  is not thought to be disease related, it will constitute an 
abnormal lymph node, but not a lesion.
All other  lymph nodes will be considered normal and will not constitute nodal 
lesions.
6.2.6Criteria for normalization of lesions
• The normalization of lesions  is defined as follow:
-A measurable  nodal lesion must become ≤ 15 mm in long axis to be 
considered normalized.
-A non-measurable  nodal lesion must decrease to ≤10 mm in the short axis 
and be ≤ 15 mm in long axis to be considered normalized.
-An extranodal  lesion must disappear completely (assigned a size of 0 mm 
x 0 mm) to be considered normalized.
6.3 Immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)
6.3.1In addition to above, tumor response for both solid tumors and lymphoma will be 
assessed by the irRECIST for investigational  purposes,  not assessment of primary 
objective.37 In RECIST v1.1, the appearance of new lesions indicates PD. However, 
in irRECIST, new measurable lesions are incorporated in the tumor burden, which is 
used to determine irPD, immune-related partial response (irPR), and immune-related 
complete response (irCR).  New nonmeasurable lesions preclude irCR. Under RECST 
v1.1, there is no confirmation for PD. Under irRECIST, responses and irPDs must be 
confirmed by consecutive scans at least 4 weeks apart, assuming no clinical deterioration. We 
will define  immune-related clinical benefit rate as immune-related stable disease  
(irSD), irPR,  or irCR.

6.4 Primary Endpoint
The primary  objective is to identify maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination 
treatment of nivolumab and veliparib. 
The MTD  will be defined as the highest dose that causes dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
in <2 of 6 patients and is determined for this study.. 
6.5 Secondary Endpoints
6.5.1Secondary endpoints include the number, frequency,  and severity of adverse 
events (as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events or CTCAE version 4.03) will be recorded.
6.5.2To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with nivolumab and veliparib in this population by 
objective response rate (ORR, defined as partial response (PR) + complete response 
(CR)), clinical benefit rate (CBR, defined as stable disease (SD) for ≥12 weeks, PR, + 
CR), and Progression Free Survival (PFS, defined as the time from treatment initiation 
to documented disease progression) using RECIST criteria v1.1 or the Lugano 2014 
classification for assessment of Lymphoma36. 
For the  preliminary efficacy analysis, ORR and other measures will be computed 
separately for patients with and those without genetic mutations, at the first 
imaging (8 weeks). Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated by RECISTv 1.1. As 
exploratory analysis, irRECIST will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy as well.  
All ORR will use the first imaging time point whether RECIST or irRECIST.

7.0 ADVERSE  EVENTS
This study  will be conducted in compliance  with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  of the 
Robert  H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University  (please refer to 
Appendices for additional  information). The level of risk attributed to this study requires high level 
monitoring, as outlined in the DSMP.  In addition,  the study will abide  by all safety reporting  
regulations,  as set forth in the Code of Federal  Regulations.
7.1 Adverse Event Monitoring
Adverse event  data  collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical  
trial, are done to ensure  the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those  
who will enroll in future studies using  similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a 
routine manner from the time of consent until 30 days after treatment discontinuation (100 
days for SAE’s) at scheduled  times during a trial (see Section 5 for time points). In 
addition,  certain adverse  events must  be reported in an expedited manner to allow for 
optimal monitoring and patient safety and care.
All patients  experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug,  
will be followed until:
the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute  the adverse  
event  return  to baseline;
any abnormal laboratory  values have returned to baseline;
there is a satisfactory explanation  other than the study drug for the changes  
observed; or
death
7.2 Definitions & Descriptions
7.2.1Adverse Event
An adverse  event  (AE) is any untoward medical  occurrence in a patient  receiving  
study treatment  and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship  with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
IRB #: STU00204250-MOD0043 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/16/2020 through 9/29/2020.
NU Study  Number: NU 16MH03
                                             BMS Study Number:  CA 209-783
       Abbvie Study Number: A15-831
Initial Version  Date: October 6, 2016
Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 50(including an  abnormal  laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  
associated with the use of an experimental  intervention,  whether or not related to 
the intervention.
Recording of  AEs should be done in a concise manner using standard,  
acceptable medical terms. In general,  AEs are not procedures or measurements,  
but should reflect the reason  for the procedure  or the diagnosis based on the 
abnormal measurement.  Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or 
frequency during  the study should also be recorded (a preexisting condition that 
does not worsen is not an AE). Further, a procedure  or surgery is not an AE; 
rather,  the event leading to the procedure  or surgery is considered an AE.
If a specific  medical diagnosis  has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome  
should be recorded as the AE whenever  possible. However, a complete  
description of the signs, symptoms and investigations which led to the diagnosis  
should be provided. For example, if clinically significant elevations of liver 
function tests are known to be secondary to hepatitis, “hepatitis” and not 
“elevated liver function tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not known, the 
abnormal test or finding  should be recorded  as an AE, using appropriate medical  
terminology (e/g/ thrombocytopenia, peripheral  edema, QT prolongation).
7.2.2Severity of AEs
All non-hematologic  adverse  events will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  The 
CTCAE v4.03 is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
If no CTCAE  grading is available, the severity  of an AE is graded as follows:
Mild (grade 1): the event  causes discomfort without disruption of normal  daily 
activities.
Moderate  (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal  daily 
activities.
Severe (grade 3): the event  makes the patient  unable to perform  normal  daily 
activities or  significantly affects his/her clinical status.
Life-threatening  (grade  4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.
Fatal (grade 5): the event  caused death.
7.2.3Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
All SAEs,  regardless  of attribution,  occurring from time of signed informed  
consent, through 100 days after the last administration of study  drug,  must  be 
reported upon discovery or occurrence.
An SAE  is defined  in regulatory terminology as any untoward medical  occurrence  
that:
Results in death.
If death results  from (progression of) the disease, the disease should  be 
reported as event  itself.
Is life-threatening.
The patient  was at risk  of death at the time of the event; it does not  refer to 
an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing  
hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours.
Results in persistent or significant  disability or incapacity.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is an important medical  event.
Any event  that does not meet the above  criteria, but that in the judgment of 
the investigator jeopardizes  the patient, may be considered for reporting  as a

Initial Version  Date: October 6, 2016
Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 51serious adverse  event. The event  may require medical  or surgical  
intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious  
Adverse Event“.
For example:  allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive  treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result  in 
hospitalization;  development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
7.2.4Exceptions to AE  and SAE definitions
Generally speaking,  any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged  
hospitalization should  be documented and reported as an SAE,  as described  
above. Likewise, any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as 
an AE if the condition meets  the criteria for an AE. However, for the purposes of 
this study, neither the condition,  hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization,  nor 
surgery are reported as AEs or SAEs under the following circumstances:
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization is for a diagnostic or elective  
surgical procedure for a preexisting  condition. Surgery should not be 
reported as an outcome  of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery  
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome  was uneventful.
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization is required to allow efficacy  
measurement for the study.
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization is required for study-directed  
therapy of the target disease  of the study, unless  it is a worsening or 
increase in frequency  of hospital admissions as judged by the principal  
investigator.
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization is due to social reasons (i.e. 
awaiting transport  home).
Pregnancy is not considered a serious adverse event, any patients  who 
become pregnant during the study should discontinue  the study  
immediately. Patients should be instructed to notify the investigator if  it is 
determined after completion of the study that they become pregnant  either  
during the treatment  phase of the study or within 30 days or five half-lives  
after the treatment period, whichever is longer.
7.2.5Adverse Event  of Special Interest (AESI)
An AESI  is one of scientific  and medical interest  specific to understanding of the 
investigational product and may require  close monitoring. An AESI  may be serious 
or non-serious. The close monitoring and discussion of AESIs allows ongoing 
surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in 
association with the use of this investigational  product. The following are 
considered to be AESI:
  Hepatic Function Abno rmali ty
Hepatic function abnormality is defined  as any increase in ALT or AST to 
greater  than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in bilirubin to greater than 
2 × ULN.  Concurrent  findings are those that derive from a single blood draw or 
from separate  blood draws taken within 8 days of each other.  Follow-up 
investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by the investigational site 
to determine  whether  the findings are reproducible  and/or whether there is 
objective evidence that clearly  supports causation by a disease (e.g.,  
cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent  
other than the investigational product.
If the  underlying diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality is known 
(including  progression of pre-existing  disease such as primary or metastatic  
malignancy), the diagnosis should be recorded as an AE/SAE.
If the  underlying diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality remains  
unknown,  the term “hepatic function abnormal” should be used to report  the

       Abbvie Study Number: A15-831
Initial Version  Date: October 6, 2016
Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 52AE/SAE.  Hepatic  function  abnormality of unknown  etiology, or which is 
considered attributable  to investigational product, is required to be reported 
as “hepatic function  abnormal”. The investigator will review the data with the 
PI. The investigator should  then use clinical judgment to establish the cause 
based on local standard of care and follow the subject by conducting  testing  
as clinically indicated.
Pneumonitis
Adverse events of pneumonitis  are also of interest,  as pneumonitis has 
been  observed with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs. Initial work-up should 
include high-resolution CT scan, ruling out infection,  and pulse oximetry.  
Pulmonary consultation  is highly recommended.
7.2.6Other events requiring  immediate reporting  
Overdose
An overdose  is defined as a patient  receiving a dose of investigational product in 
excess of dose detailed in this protocol.
Any overdose  of a study patient with the investigational  product, with or without  
associated AEs/SAEs,  is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of  
the event.  If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must  also be recorded  on the 
AE eCRF. Overdose does not automatically  make an AE serious, but if the 
consequences of the overdose  are serious, for example death or hospitalization,  
the event is serious and must  be reported as an SAE.  The investigator will use 
clinical judgment to treat any overdose.
Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a  female patient who has received investigational product  is required  
to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.
Patients who become  pregnant  during the study period must  not receive additional  
doses of investigational  product but will not be withdrawn from the study. The 
pregnancy will be followed  for outcome  of the mother and child (including any 
premature terminations).
7.2.8Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subject or Others
A UPIRSO  is a  type of SAE that includes events that meet ALL of the following  
criteria:
Is unanticipated  in terms of nature,  severity, or frequency
Places the research subject or others at a different  or greater risk of harm
Is deemed to be at least possibly related to participation in the study.
7.3 Adverse Event Reporting
7.3.1Routine  Reporting
All routine  adverse events,  such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or 
definitely not related  to study participation, are to be reported on the appropriate  
eCRF according to the time intervals noted in the appendices. Routine AEs will 
be reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) according to the study’s  
phase and risk level,  as outlined in the DSMP.
7.3.2Determining  if Expedited Reporting is Required
This includes all  events  that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol  
treatment. Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 53also be  reported accordingly.
1) Identify the type of adverse event  using the NCI CTCAE v 4.03.
2) Grade the adverse event  using  the NCI CTCAE v 4.03.
3) Determine  whether the adverse event  is related to the protocol  therapy.  
Attribution categories  are as follows:
Definite: AE is clearly  related to the study treatment.
Probable:  AE is likely related to the study  treatment.
Possible:  AE may be related to the study treatment.
Unlikely:  AE not likely to be related to the study treatment.
Unrelated: AE is clearly  NOT  related to the study treatment.
4) Determine  the prior experience of the adverse event.
Expected events  are those  that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. An adverse event  is 
considered unexpected,  for expedited reporting purposes only,  when  
either the type of event  or the severity of the event is not listed in:
the current  protocol
the drug package insert
the current Investigator’s Brochure
7.3.3Expedited  Reporting of SAEs/Other  Events
7.3.3.1 Reporting to the Northwestern  University QAM/DMC
All SAEs  must  be reported to the assigned  Quality Assurance Monitor  
(QAM) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. Completion of 
the NU CRO SAE Form is required.
The completed form  should assess whether or not the event  qualifies as 
a UPIRSO.  The report should also include:
Protocol description and number(s)
The patient’s identification number
A description of the event, severity,  treatment, and outcome  (if 
known)
Supportive laboratory  results and diagnostics
The hospital discharge summary (if available/applicable)
All SAEs  will be  reported  to, and reviewed by, the DMC at their next 
meeting.
7.3.3.2 Reporting to the Northwestern University IRB
The following  information pertains to the responsibilities of the lead site 
(Northwestern University) and to participating sites whom have 
reporting responsibilities to Northwestern University.  Participating sites 
should follow  their local IRB guidelines for reporting to their local IRBs. .
Any death  of an NU subject that meets the NU IRB’s reporting 
criteria will be  promptly reported  .
Any death or unanticipated problem of a non-NU subject should be 
reported to the lead site promptly. Death and other unanticipated 
problems that meet NU IRB reporting criteria should be submitted to 
the NU IRB by the lead site per their posted timelines. .
Information pertaining to an NU subject that fits into any of the 
categories listed on the Reportable New Information page will be 
reported to  the NU IRB per their posted timelines.
7.3.3.3 Reporting to the FDA (completed by the NU QAM)

8.1.11Nursing  implications
Veliparib will  be administered as an oral capsule. Subjects will self-administer 
the morning dose of veliparib and the evening doses of veliparib approximately 
12 hours after the morning dose with or without food in the same calendar day. 
Veliparib dose should be followed by a glass of water (approx. 240 mL). It is 
recommended that if a subject misses a scheduled dose of veliparib and less 
than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the dose should be 
immediately taken. It is recommended that if more than 6 hours have passed 
since the scheduled dosing time, the subject should not take the missed dose 
but should wait for the next regularly scheduled dose.

8.2.4Storage and stability
Nivolumab solution  for infusion is a sterile, non-pyrogenic single-use, isotonic 
aqueous solution. Vials must be stored in a secure, limited-access location at 2 to 
8 degrees C (36 to 46 degrees F) and protected from light, freezing, and shaking. 
The product is a clear to opalescent solution, which may contain proteinaceous 
and extraneous particulates. The product is intended for IV administration. The 
drug product can be further diluted with normal saline in IV containers made of 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or non-PVC material. Opened or accessed vials should 
be immediately used to prepare the infusion solution in the IV bag and the infusion 
solution should be immediately administered.
After preparation,  store the Nivolumab infusion either:
• at  room temperature for no more than 8 hours from the time of preparation. 
This includes room temperature storage of the infusion in the IV container and 
time for administration of the infusion or
• under  refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no more than 24 hours 
from the time of infusion preparation.
•                             Do not freeze.
8.2.5Protocol  dose specifics
A fixed  dose of 240 mg IV every 2 weeks for 4 cycles; 480mg IV every 4 weeks 
thereafter 
8.2.6Preparation
Nivolumab  should be prepared in a laminar flow hood or safety cabinet using 
standard precautions for the safe handling of intravenous agents applying 
aseptic technique.
Visually  inspect the drug product solution for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration. Discard if solution is cloudy, if there is 
pronounced discoloration (solution may have a pale-yellow color), or if there is 
foreign particulate matter other than a few translucent-to-white amorphous 
particles.
Mix by gently inverting  several times. Do not shake.
Aseptically withdraw  the required volume of nivolumab solution into a syringe, 
and dispense into an IV bag.
If  multiple vials are needed for a subject, it is important to use a separate 
sterile syringe and needle for each vial to prevent problems such as dulling of 
needle tip, stopper coring, repeated friction of plunger against syringe barrel 
wall.
Do  not enter into each vial more than once. Do not administer as an IV push or 
bolus injection. 
Nivolumab  injection can be infused undiluted or diluted so as not to exceed a 
total infusion volume of 120 mL.
8.2.7Route of administration for this study
Intravenous infusion.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus injection. 
Administer through a 0.2 micron to 1.2 micron pore size, low-protein binding 
polyethersulfone membrane in-line filter.
8.2.8Incompatibilities
No incompatibilities between  nivolumab injection and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
DEHP (di[2-ethylhexyl]phthalate), non-PVC/non-DEHP (di[2-ethylhexyl]phthalate) 
IV components, or glass bottles have been observed. Nivolumab should not be 
infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other medicinal products.

8.2.10Side effects
Below are  safety data from 268 subjects with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma and 117 patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC who  received 
nivolumab alone.  Related  side effects  reported in subjects  receiving nivolumab 
alone were:
Very Frequent  – Expected to occur in more than 20% of people (more than 20 
out of 100 people):  Fatigue (50%), Dyspnea (38%), Musculoskeletal pain (36%), 
Rash (21%), Increased AST (28%), Increase alkaline phosphatase (22%), 
Hyponatremia (25-38%)
Frequent -  Expected to occur in 10% to 20% of people (10 to 20 out of 100 
people):  Pruritus (19%), Cough (17%), URI (11%), Peripheral edema (10%), 
Increased ALT (16%), Hyperkalemia (15%)
Not Frequent  – Expected to occur in less than 10% of people  (less than 10 out 
of 100 people): ventricular arrhythmia, iridocyclitis, infusion-related reactions, 
increased amylase, increased lipase, dizziness, peripheral and sensory 
neuropathy, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, vitiligo, psoriasis
Deaths thought  to be related to nivolumab  when  given alone were reported in 
approximately 0.5%  of subjects treated (approximately  1 out 200 people). 
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents  are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and 
duration than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is considered an 
immuno-oncology agent in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs 
associated with immuno oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management 
Algorithms have been developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the 
following groups of AEs:
• Gastrointestinal
• Renal
• Pulmonary
• Hepatic
• Endocrinopathy
• Skin
• Neurological
The above  algorithms are found in the nivolumab Investigator Brochure and appendix 
D of this protocol.

1. Investigational product must  be administered at room temperature by 
controlled infusion via an infusion  pump into a peripheral vein or central 
line. Prior to the start of the infusion,  ensure  that the bag contents are at 
room  temperature to avoid an infusion-related reaction due to the 
administration of the solution at low temperatures.
2. A physician must  be present at the site or immediately available to 
respond to emergencies during all administrations  of investigational 
product.  Fully  functional  resuscitation facilities should be available.  
Investigational product  must not be administered  via IV push or bolus but 
as a slow IV infusion.  The entire content  of each IV bag will be infused 
using an infusion pump. 
3. The infusion lines should be attached only at time of use. Lines used for 
infusion during  dose administration will need to be equipped with 0.22- or 
0.2-µm  in-line filters.
4. The duration of the investigational product administration will be 
recorded.
Nivolumab will  be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 30 
minutes or 60 minutes (for 240mg or 480mg dosing, respectively). Vitals will be 
measured before, during, and after each infusion (see section 4.2 for details). When an 
IV bag is used for the infusion, the IV line will be flushed  with a volume of 
normal saline equal to the priming volume of the infusion set used after the 
contents of the IV bag are fully administered  (unless  prohibited  by institutional  
practice).

9.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL  STUDIES
9.1 Sample Collection  Guidelines
Tissue: A fresh tissue biopsy of the primary tumor or a metastatic site at baseline will be 
collected if appropriate. If a fresh tissue biopsy is not feasible, archival tissue should be 
collected (if available, cell block preferred or 15 unstained slides) by any means possible.  
Unavailability of tissue will not exclude patients. Fresh tissue biopsies will be performed 
using an image-guided core needle at the aforementioned time points according to 
institutional practice. Tumor samples will be stored and may be used for additional 
correlative studies at a later date such as, but not limited to, immunohistochemistry, tumor 
mutation analysis, and proteomic analysis.
Blood: Blood samples will be drawn pre-dose on Induction Day 1, C1D1, C3D1, and at the 
End of Treatment visit. See lab manual for further details and tube types. 
9.2 Sample Processing,  Storage,  and Shipment
Refer to  the lab manual  for sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment 
information.
9.3 Assay Methodology
9.3.1 Biomarker Analysis (Tissue and Blood)
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded  tumor specimens  will be stained with anti-PD-
L1 monoclonal antibodies.  PD-L1 will be scored as a percentage  by two 
independent  pathologists who are unaware of clinical data. PD-L1 staining as a 
predictive measure will be explored at various thresholds of positivity.
TILs (CD8+,  CD4+,  nuclear  FOXP3+) will be quantified by immunohistochemistry 
and assessed on hematoxylin and eosin  stained tumor sections.  TIL subsets  will 
be classified  as intraepithelial (iTILs)  or stromal (sTILs), where iTILs are defined 
as the percentage  of lymphocytes in direct  contact with tumor cells,  and sTILs are 
defined as the percentage of lymphocytes relative to the tumor stroma. Scoring, 
as a continuous percentage, will be performed by two independent pathologists  
who are unaware of clinical data.
Population of  CD4+,  CD8+,  and regulatory T cells (CD4+/CD25+) will be counted 
by cell sorting  of PBMCs. Expression  of CD4,  CD8, and FOXP3 will be also 
examined in the tumor  tissues  to estimate relative ratio between  T helper cells,  
killer T cells,  and regulatory T cells.
Blood will  be collected at C1D1, C3D1, and the End of Treatment visit for 
biomarker analysis.
9.3.2 Flow  Cytometry (Blood)

9.3.3 Immune and  Genomic Biomarkers 
To assess  the dynamic change in both immune and genomic biomarkers in blood 
that may correlate with response to veliparib. Blood will be collected prior to starting 
veliparib (Induction Day 1) and pre-dose on C1D1.
10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints
This will be  a phase I/IB study of nivolumab and veliparib in patients with advanced solid 
tumors and lymphoma harboring mutations in selected DNA repair genes.  
The primary  endpoint is to evaluate  the toxicities and tolerability of nivolumab and 
veliparib and to identify the maximum tolerated dose for combination treatment.
Secondary endpoints  include  ORR according to irRECIST, PFS at 24 weeks, time until 
death or disease progression, and to identify additional predictive biomarkers and 
resistance mechanisms to treatment using additional genetic and immunology-based 
assessment platforms. For the preliminary efficacy analysis, ORR will be computed at 
the first imaging (8 weeks). Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated by RECISTv 1.1. As 
exploratory analysis, irRECIST will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy as well.  All 
ORR will use the first imaging time point whether RECIST or irRECIST.
Exploratory endpoints  include  biomarkers predictive of response include assessment of 
tissue-based immunohistochemical  expression  of PD-L1; TILs; peripheral T cell 
subpopulations; changes in tissue and peripheral  T cell receptor sequencing, HLA 
genotype,  and immune-related  candidate gene  signatures at baseline.
Pharmacodynamic biomarker  assessment  will include changes in tissue based  
immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1; TILs; peripheral T cell subpopulations, and T 
cell receptor genotype at baseline and after two months of treatment with veliparib and 
nivolumab.
10.2 Sample Size and Accrual
The initial  study has recruited 3 patients at the lower dose and 6 at the MTD. Of these 6 
at the MTD, 4 have genetic mutation of interest, and 2 do not. The study will, due to lack 
of funding and other reasons recruit 6 more patients with genetic mutation of interest. 
The response rate will be computed separately for 4+6 = 10 patients with genetic 
mutation.

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 6218 based  on the 3+3 design. 
Expansion Cohort
The initial  study design was to accrue a total of up to 50 patients (for 48 evaluable) to the 
study in two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. The original design 
anticipated a total of 6-18 patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma in the dose 
escalation phase; 9 patients were enrolled, including 6 that were treated at the MTD of 400 
mg BID. Due to funding issues, the study will perform an early analysis of preliminary efficacy 
after the next 6 patients are enrolled in the expansion cohort.
. 
As stated  above, in the modified plan for expansion cohort , will accrue 6 new patients 
with genetic alteration for early preliminary efficacy assessment, which together with 4 
previously treated patients with genetic mutation will provide total of 6+4=10 patients, 
with genetic mutation. ORR will be computed at the first imaging (8 weeks). Preliminary 
efficacy will be evaluated by RECISTv 1.1. As exploratory analysis, irRECIST will be 
used to obtain preliminary efficacy as well.  All ORR will use the first imaging time point 
whether RECIST or irRECIST.
The study will be considered a success if the lower 90% exact confidence bound will be 
> 10% , i.e. if three or more successes out of n=10 are observed. 
I According to the modified plan for the current trial, the study will be closed after the 6 additional 
patients will have been recruited.” 
 
10.3 Data Analyses Plans
The primary analysis  will  be on the intent-to-treat  (ITT) population, including all evaluable  
patients.  Clinical  benefit  rate will be defined as stable disease (for ≥12 weeks), complete  
or partial response by both the Response Evaluation  Criteria in Solid  Tumors (RECIST) 
and irRECIST or Lugano Criteria 2014.  Maximum response prior to disease progression 
will be used.  The overall response  rate will be estimated by the proportion of overall 
response, and its 80% confidence..
Additionally,  we will  evaluate overall response rate, defined as complete or partial  
response using RECIST or Lugano Criteria 2014  guidelines in a similar manner. We will 
also perform similar  analyses using Immune Related RECIST  (irRECIST). Duration of 
response,  defined as the duration from the first documentation of clinical benefit to the 
first documented  progressive disease or death of any cause,  whichever occurs first, will 
also be analyzed.  For patients alive and progression-free at the time of data cut off, 
duration of response  will be censored as of the last tumor assessment date. Duration of 
response will only be evaluated for the subgroup of patients with a clinical benefit  using 
the Kaplan-Meier  method.
PFS is defined  as the time from treatment initiation to documented disease progression.  
OS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until death due to any cause.  For 
patients alive at the time of data cut-off,  PFS and OS will be censored as of the last tumor  
assessment date or known to be alive,  respectively.  The PFS and OS will be estimated  
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The number,  frequency,  and severity of adverse  events  
(as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events or CTCAE  
version 4.03) will be recorded.

Eligibility checklist (signed and dated by the treating physician – upload to NOTIS)
Eligibility eCRF (complete in NOTIS)
Copy of the pathology  report (upload to NOTIS)
Training on  eCRF completion will be provided  at the time of site activation.  Please refer 
to the eCRF demonstration videos on the CRO website for additional  instructions on 
registering a patient.
The QAM will review  the registration,  register the patient, assign a subject identification  
number, and send a confirmation of registration to study  personnel.  Registration  will then 
be complete and the patient may begin study treatment.
11.4 Data Submission
Once a  subject is confirmed  and registered to the study,  eCRFs should be submitted  
according to the detailed data submission guidelines  (provided in a separate  document).  
Generally,  all data are due within 10 days of each study visit .
11.5 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing
This study  will be conducted  in compliance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
of the Robert  H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (please  
refer to NOTIS  for additional information). The level of risk attributed to this study  
requires high level monitoring, as outlined in the DSMP. The assigned QAM, with 
oversight  from  the Data Monitoring  Committee, will monitor this study in accordance with 
the study phase and risk level.  Please refer to NOTIS  for additional data submission  
instructions.
11.6 Adherence to the Protocol
Except for  an emergency  situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, and 
well-being of the study  patient requires  alternative treatment, the study shall be 
conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.
11.6.1 Emergency Modifications
Investigators may implement  a deviation from,  or a change of, the protocol  to 
eliminate an immediate  hazard(s) to trial subjects without  prior IRB approval.
For any such  emergency modification implemented, an IRB modification form 
must be completed within 5 business  days of making  the change,  and the QAM  
must be notified within 24 hours of such change.
11.6.2 Other  Protocol  Deviations
All other  deviations from the protocol must  be reported to the assigned QAM  
using the appropriate  form.
A protocol  deviation is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved protocol  
that:
Is generally noted  or recognized after it occurs.
Has no substantive effect on the risks to research  participants.
Has no substantive  effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the 
value of the data collected.
Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).
A protocol  deviation may be considered an instance of Reportable New 
Information(RNI ) if it:
Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research  
participants.
Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.
Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).

Amendment 7:  3.3.2020 65Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance  with federal regulations,  
State laws,  or University policies.
11.7 Investigator Obligations
The Principal Investigator  is responsible for the conduct  of the clinical  trial at the site in 
accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or  the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The PI is responsible for personally overseeing  the treatment of all study  
patients.  The PI must  assure that all study site personnel, including sub-investigators and 
other study staff members, adhere  to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations 
and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.
The Principal Investigator  at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all 
the required  data will be collected, entered onto the appropriate eCRFs, and submitted  
within the study-specific  timeframes. Periodically,  monitoring visits may be conducted and 
the Principal  Investigator  will provide access to his/her original records to permit  
verification of proper entry of data.  The study may also be subject to routine audits by the 
Clinical Trial Audit  Committee  (CTAC),  as outlined  in the DSMP.
11.8 Publication  Policy
All potential  publications  and/or  data for potential publications  (e.g. manuscripts,  articles, 
data, text, diagrams,  abstracts, posters, charts, slides, pictures, or clinicaltrials.gov  
releases) must  be approved in accordance with the policies and processes set forth in 
the Lurie  Cancer Center DSMP. The assigned QAM  will prepare a preliminary data 
summary (to be approved by the DMC) no later than 3 months after the study reaches  its 
primary completion date (the date that the final subject  is examined or receives an 
intervention for the purposes of final data collection  for the primary endpoint). If the 
investigators wish to obtain DMC-approved data prior to this point (or prior to the point 
dictated by study design), the PI must  send a written request  for data to the QAM 
including justification. If the request is approved, data will be provided no later than 4 
weeks after this request approval. The data will be presented to the DMC at their next 
available meeting,  and a final,  DMC-approved  dataset  will be released along  with any 
DMC decisions regarding publication.  The investigators are expected to use only DMC-
approved data in future publications.  The investigators should  submit a copy of the 
manuscript to the biostatistician to confirm that the DMC-approved  data are used 
appropriately. Once the biostatistician gives final approval,  the manuscript  may be 
submitted to external publishers. 
NU shall provide  BMS with a copy of each Publication at the earliest practicable time, 
but in any event not less than thirty (30) days prior to its submission to a journal, 
publisher or meeting or fifteen (15) days prior to any public disclosure of any manuscript 
or other public disclosure (e.g., presentations)..

APPENDIX  A- CONTRACEPTION REQUIREMENTS
Investigators shall  counsel FOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with FOCBP on
the importance  of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy
Investigators shall  advise FOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with FOCBP on the
use of  highly effective methods of contraception from the time of treatment initiation to 5 months (for 
FOCBP) or 7 months (for males with FOCBP partners) after the last dose of nivolumab. Highly 
effective methods of contraception have
a failure  rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
At a  minimum, subjects must agree to the use of two methods of contraception, with one method
being highly  effective and the other method being either highly effective or less effective as listed
below:
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE  METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
a) Male  condoms with spermicide
b) Hormonal methods  of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal
ring, injectables,  implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena® by FOCBP
subject or male  subject’s FOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects participating
in the  study may use hormone based contraceptives as one of the acceptable methods of
contraception since  they will not be receiving study drug.
c) Nonhormonal  IUDs, such as ParaGard®
d) Tubal ligation
e) Vasectomy.
f) Complete  Abstinence*
*Complete abstinence  is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is an
acceptable form  of contraception for all study drugs. Subjects who choose complete abstinence
are not  required to use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must continue to
have pregnancy  tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be
discussed in  the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS  OF CONTRACEPTION
a) Diaphragm  with spermicide
b) Cervical cap  with spermicide
c) Vaginal sponge
d) Male  Condom without spermicide*
e) Progestin  only pills by FOCBP subject or male subject’s FOCBP partner
f) Female Condom*
*A male  and female condom must not be used together

nivolumab and veliparib 
in patients with prior 
exposure to single agent 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors”Removes secondary  objective

excluded given its presumed 
efficacy with veliparib 
monotherapy.”Clarification 
requested
 by FDA to 
be consistent with 
language in section

patients with aggressive 
lymphoma, there should be no 
other standard therapies that 
would confer survival benefit.”Clarification 
requested
 by FDA
4.0 (Treatment  Plan) Numbered tables  1- Re-numbers tables  4.1-4.Simplification for  
clarity
4.3.1 (Definition  of 
DLT)“The treating  physician 
should provide attribution 
to study drugs for all AE’s 
to the best of his or her 
ability, however the 
following events will still 
be classified as DLT’s if 
attribution is not 
available.”Removes prior  language and 
adds: 
“All adverse events specified 
below will be DLT’s except 
those that are clearly and 
incontrovertibly due to 
extraneous causes.”Clarification 
requested
 by FDA. 
Investigator 
attribution is not 
appropriate for a new 
combination 
treatment including 
an unapproved 
therapy 
4.3.1 (Definition  of 
DLT)Did not include  
hematologic toxicity as 
DLTAdds the  following hematologic 
DLTs:
Grade 4  thrombocytopenia 
(platelets < 25.0 x 109/L)
Grade  4 neutropenia (ANC < 
0.5 x 109/L)
Grade  3 febrile neutropenia

diarrhea
Grade  3 nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea 
lasting for >72 hours
Other Grade ≥  3 
toxicities possibly 
related to either 
veliparib or nivolumab 
(Note: any alopecia 
and transient grade 3-4 
laboratory 
abnormalities including 
asymptomatic 
LFTs/amylase/lipase 
that are not clinically 
significant will not be 
considered DLTs.DLT criteria  to read as follows:
Grade ≥  3 non-hematologic 
toxicities that represent at least 
a 2-grade increase from 
baseline and are possibly 
related to either veliparib or 
nivolumab with the following 
exceptions:
a. Nausea  and vomiting lasting 
≤48 hours
b. Electrolyte  abnormalities 
resolving within ≤24 hours
c. Hypersensitivity  
reactions
d. Alopecialanguage from  
another Phase I/II 
protocol using 
veliparib in 
combination therapy. 
FDA request to 
remove LFT’s as 
exception and 
elaborate on 
“transient” lab 
abnormalities. New 
language is more 
concise and clear.
4.3.2 (Dose  
Escalation 3+3 Rule)Allowed for up  to 9 
patients to be enrolled at 
dose level 1 to establish 
the MTD at dose level 1.Removes  this language – 
only 6 patients may be 
treated to establish MTD, 
and there are no exceptions 
for dose level 1.
Exception  to dose level 1 
has been clarified – if dose 
escalation is stopped at dose 
level 1, patients may be 
enrolled at dose level -1 to 
establish MTD.FDA  safety 
request that MTD 
is reached when 2 
out of 6 patients 
experience a DLT. 
Clarification.  Was 
previously unclear 
when dose level -1 
would be utilized.

Management & Dose 
Delays/Modifications)Referred to  the “Schedule 
of Events Table”Changes to  “Table 5”Corrected for 
consistency
10.2 (Sample Size  
and Accrual)Sample size  referenced 
30 total patients without 
differentiating between 
the overall sample size 
and that in the expansion 
cohort. Also referenced 
30 patients “per 
histological cohort”Adds separate  headings for 
the dose escalation phase and 
the expansion cohort, and 
removes language referring to 
histological cohorts. FDA request  for 
clarification on non-
coherent language. 
Clarifies that 30 total 
patients refers only 
to the expansion 
cohort, and that total 
accrual for the study 
will be up to 50. The 
histological cohorts 
were included by 
mistake and do not 
align with the study 
design.

109/L)”FDA request  given 
possible hematologic 
toxicities associated 
with veliparib
4.7.1 (Continuation  of 
Investigational 
Therapy after 
Progression)Patients were  allowed to 
continue treatment 
beyond progression 
unless confirmed by a 
subsequent scan; 
however, there was a 
concession for patients to 
continue treatment if PD 
was confirmed but they 
were receiving clinical 
benefit.Replaces language  to mirror 
another ongoing 
immunotherapy trial and 
remove the concession for 
clinical benefit:
“Confirmed PD:  An initial 
assessment of PD by RECIST 
1.1 or Lugano criteria will be 
confirmed by a repeat 
evaluation at the next tumor 
assessment time point, but no 
sooner than 4 weeks later (see 
section 6.1.7 & Appendix C, 
respectively). If any 
subsequent tumor assessment 
shows progression per 
RECIST v1.1 or Lugano 
criteria in the overall tumor 
burden (the sum of diameters 
of target lesions and new 
lesions), when compared to 
the initial PD assessment (the 
sum of diameters of target 
lesions and new lesions), then 
PD is confirmed.”FDA request  to align 
more closely with 
current 
immunotherapy 
trials.

endpointsAdded language  to state that 
“For the  preliminary 
efficacy analysis, 
ORR will be 
computed at the first 
imaging (8 weeks). 
Preliminary efficacy 
will be evaluated by 
RECISTv 1.1. As 
exploratory analysis, 
irRECIST will be 
used to obtain 
preliminary efficacy 
as well.  All ORR will 
use the first imaging 
time point whether 
RECIST or 
irRECIST.”To align with the  
preliminary efficacy  
analysis plan for 
the expansion 
cohort, as stated in 
the rest of the

 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
 
This is a phase  II study  of the small  molecule  inhibitor  perifosine  (NSC 639966,  
D21266,  KRX -0401)  in the treatment  of patients  with recurrent  glioblastoma  
multiforme  (GBM)  and other recurrent  malignant gliomas.  The sponsor of this study  
is Keryx,  as well as AOI pharmaceuticals  and OCOG,  which  are subsidiaries  of Keryx.  
The goal of  the phase  II study is  to determine  efficacy  as measured  by the  progression - 
free survival rate after 6 months  of treatment.   Secondary  goals  include  determination  
of molecular and metabolic  effects  of perifosine  by tissue  analysis  and PET imaging.  
In addition,  when  cytoreductive s urgery  is recommended  as part of  the standard  of 
care at study  entry, patients  will be considered  for a “surgical arm.”    In this case,  
patients  will receive  perifosine  for 5-10 days before  surgery  during  which  tumor  will 
be aliquoted  both for diagnostic  purposes  and for molecular effects  of the drug in vivo  
and for analysis  of drug penetration  into tumor  tissue.   A schema  is shown  on the  
following  page.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Malignant  gliomas  
 
The most  common  cancer arising  from the brain  is the glioblastoma  multiforme  
(GBM).   It is also the most  aggressive  subtype among  the gliomas,  a collection  of 
tumors  including  astrocytomas  and oligodendrogliomas.   While  the extent of 
surgical  resection  is an important  prognostic  factor  [1, 2], malignant  gliomas  are 
diffusely  infiltrative  tumors;  hence,  all locally  directed  therapy  (surgery,  
radiotherapy)  inherently  palliative.   Such  tumors  are also relentlessly  progressive  
with the most  aggressive  forms  carrying  a dismal  prognosis.  For example,  the 
median  survival of  patients  with GBM  is approximately  1 year.  Chemotherapy,  
typically  temozolomide,  is usually  given  either  during  radiotherapy  (and 
continued  afterward)  or following  radiotherapy,  and a recent multinational  study  
demonstrated  a modest  survival  benefit  of 2.5 months  relative to radiotherapy  
alone [2].  However,  only 10.7% of  patients  were  progression -free and only 
26.5% of  patients  were  alive  2 years following  diagnosis  [2].  Recurrent disease 
following  radiotherapy  is commonly  refractory  to treatment,  with a 6mPFS  
following  carmustine  (BCNU)  of only 17.5% in a  recent  study  [3]. Therefore,  
while  systemic  chemotherapy improves  the outcome  for some  patients,  long term 
disease  control  presently  remains  elusive.   Novel agents  that inhibit the key 
molecular  pathways  driving  glioma  growth  need  evaluation  in malignant gliomas.

 3.2 Perifosine  (NSC  639966,  D21266,  KRX -0401)  
 
Alkylphospholipids represent  a new class of  lipid-related  compounds  that exhibit  
promising  anticancer  activity  and a different  spectrum  of toxicity  than 
conventional  cytotoxic  agents.   Perifosine  (1,1-dimethyl -4 [[(octadecyloxy)  
hydroxyphosphinyl]oxy] -piperidinium inner salt) is a synthetic,  substituted  
heterocyclic alkylphospholipid,  structurally  related  to miltefosine  (NSC 60558, D- 
18506).  The anti-tumor activity  of miltefosine  was initially  evaluated  in the 
1980s, and it is licensed  in Europe  as a topical  application  for the treatment  of 
patients  with cutaneous  metastases  from  breast cancer.  It is also used  in an oral  
formulation  to treat leishmaniasis.   Because the only major  toxicities  of 
miltefosine  are gastrointestinal  --and this was thought  be a local  rather  than a 
central  effect  of the drug,  numerous  analogues were  developed  to see  if a less  
toxic analogue  could be  identified.  Perifosine  was identified  as a potentially  
active  and better  tolerated  analog of  miltefosine.  Its spectrum of activity  across  
the NCI 60 cell  line screen  was very similar  to miltefosine (Pearson  correlation  
coefficient  = 0.817).  Both  miltefosine  and perifosine  had very unique patterns  of 
in vitro  cell growth  inhibition  that are distinctly  different  from  most  cytotoxic  
agents. Perifosine  has been shown  to be more  active  and better  tolerated  than 
miltefosine  in preclinical  models  [4]. Perifosine  exhibited  marked  activity  in 
animal  and human  tumor  cell lines resistant to standard  chemotherapeutic  agents  
with relative sparing of  normal  cells,  including  macrophages,  bone marrow cells 
and normal  glial cells in a glioblastoma  model.  
 
Alkylph ospholipids are known  to affect  tumor  cell proliferation,  differentiation,  
invasion,  and metastasis.  These  compounds  are absorbed  directly  into cell 
membranes  where  they accumulate  (reviewed  in [5]).  Although  there  is 
considerable evidence  that the plasma  membrane  is the primary  site of action,  
alkylphospholipids  may be widely  distributed  throughout  the cytoplasm  and 
possibly within  the nucleus.   [6, 7] 
 
3.3 Perifosine  Mechanism  of Action  
 
Perifosine  has been shown  to inhibit or otherwise  modify  signaling  through  a 
number  of different  signal  transduction  pathways including  PI3K/AKT,  
RAS/MAPK  which  are of particular interest  because  these pathways  are active in 
the majority  of malignant gliomas  and combined  activation  of these  pathways  
induce GBMs  in mice  [8].

 Figure 1: RAS and AKT cascades  are inhibited by perifosine . 
 
 
 
Approximately  70% of  GBMs  exhibit activated  AKT  [8, 9], typically  through  loss 
of the tumor  suppressor PTEN[10 -12] which  normally  represses  AKT activation  
(figure  1). Modeling by Dr. Holland  here at MSKCC and others has also 
demonstrated  that PTEN loss is functionally  equivalent to AKT activation[13],  
and that  either  PTEN loss or activated  AKT can combine  with RAS activation  to 
induce GBMs[8,  13].  One downstream  effector  of AKT is the mammalian  target  
of rapamycin  (mTOR);  however,  treatment  with mTOR inhibitors  such as  with 
rapamycin  (sirolimus)  or CCI-779 (temsirolimus)  [14] for  recurrent  high grade  
gliomas  have not shown  response or survival  rates that are markedly  superior  to 
those observed  with traditional  chemotherapies  such as temozolomide[2,  15-17] 
or BCNU  [3].  One potential  explanation  is that mTOR inhibitors  affect  only a  
subset of  the pathways  activated  by AKT.   Therefore,  inhibition  of AKT  itself  
may be more  effective  as an anti-cancer  treatment.   In addition,  rapamycin  and its  
analogs also are associated  with severe  toxicity  in some  patients, including  
thrombocytopenia  and hyperlipidemia,  limiting  their use.   Other  direct inhibitors  
of AKT have been too  toxic  for clinical  use.  By contrast,  perifosine  has been  
used with limited  toxicity  in humans  (below).

 3.4 Pre-clinical  studies  
3.4.1  In vitro  
Prior  to stimulation  of the PI3K/AKT pathway,  AKT is localized  in the  
cellular cytoplasm.   Following  stimulation  and activation  of PI3K,  AKT is 
recruited  to the cell membrane,  where  it then localizes.  Since  the long  alkyl  
chain of  the alkylphosphocholines  can insert  into the outer  leaflet  of the 
plasma  membrane  and since  these  agents  use lipids,  such as those  found  in 
cellular  membranes,  as substrates,  it seemed  plausible  that perifosine  might  
inhibit  a transduction  pathway  component known  to be dependent  for its 
activity  on membrane  localization.  
 
Investigators  at the US National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  first studied  the effects  
of perifosine on AKT using a prostate cell line, PC-3, which  is known  to have  
a mutated,  non-functional  PTEN and thus to have constitutively  activated  
AKT.  [7] Their results demonstrated  that very small  doses of  perifosine  
(5μM)  blocked  phosphorylation  of AKT but did not decrease the total amount  
of AKT present in  the cell.  These effects  occurred  within  30 minutes  of 
exposure to  perifosine,  suggesting  this was an initial  event  rather  than a 
secondary phenomenon  due to perifosine  effects elsewhere  in the cell. When  
perifosine  was removed,  substantial  recovery  of AKT phosphorylation began  
within  one hour,  also suggesting  that perifosine’s effects  are specific  and not 
the result  of general  detergent  effects.   Perifosine also blocked  the effects of 
insulin, EGF  (epidermal  growth  factor),  PDGF (platelet  derived  growth   
factor)  and other ligands  known  to stimulate  AKT activation.  By contrast,  
perifosine  did not affect  growth  factor -mediated  PI3K activation.  Finally,  the 
investigators showed  that perifosine  blocked  the localization  of AKT to the  
cell membrane,  consistent  with the observation  that PI3K activation  was not 
affected  but AKT phosphorylation was clearly  diminished,  and with the initial  
hypothesis  that led to the initiation  of these studies.  
 
Investigators  at the Netherlands  Cancer  Institute in Amsterd am obtained  
similar  results  using  the epithelial  cell line A431  and HeLa.  [6] Three  
alkylphosphocholines,  including  both miltefosine and perifosine,  were  
evaluated,  and all appeared  to inhibit  AKT in a dose-dependent  fashion.  The 
alkylphosphocholines  also blocked stimulation  of AKT activity  by insulin.  
 
These  effects  on AKT were accomplished  with perifosine levels  that inhibit  
the growth  of tumor  cells in vitro and that can be achieved  in the clinic.  
 
Preclinical  studies  undertaken  mainly  by Dr. Holland’s lab at MSKCC have  
also demonstrated  that perifosine is a potent  inhibitor  of AKT signaling  in glia 
in vitro.  In addition,  perifosine  (PRF)  inhibits the RAS cascade (reduced  
pERK)  in glia, an effect not achieved  by the mTOR inhibitor  rapamycin

 (Rap).   The dual inhibition  of AKT and RAS signaling by PRF is a major  
theoretical  advantage  over agents  that inhibit  only one but not both cascades,  
especially  because these  cascades  are activated  in ~70%  and ~100%  of 
GBMs,  respectively.   Furthermore,  forced  activation  of both cascades  in mice  
is sufficient to induce GBMs  [8].  Therefore,  combined  inhibition  of both 
cascades  with one agent  such as PRF may offer  significant therapeutic  
advantage over mTOR inhibitors  and over agents  that inhibit only AKT or 
RAS.

The activity  of perifosine has been evaluated  in numerous  other  human  and 
murine  cell lines.   Cell lines  demonstrating  the greatest  sensitivity  to 
perifosine included  KB (larynx), LNCaP (prostate),  MAI -PaCa -2 (pancreas),  
DLD -1 (colon), and SK-HEP -1 (liver)  (IC50  1.0 – 4.9 µg/mL)  (Perifosine  
Investigator’s  Brochure  2003).   In a soft agar tumor  stem  cell assay, the  
human  KB (squamous)  and murine  L1210  (leukemia)  cell lines  were  the most  
sensitive.  In the methylene  blue exclusion  assay,  the five most  sensitive  lines 
were:   KB (squamous  mouth), LU 65A (lung), LNCaP (prostate),  PC-1 (lung)  
and Hep-2 (larynx)  with IC50  values  of 0.8 – 3.4 g/mL.   In the  
SRB/metabolic  capacity  assay, KM12  (colon), PC3 (prostate),  M14  
(melanoma),  HOP -92 (lung) and SF295  (CNS)  cancer cell lines  were  the most  
sensitive  with IC50  values  of 0.2 – 3.1 g/mL.   The majority  of cell lines (in 
all assays)  were  more  sensitive  to perifosine  than to miltefosine.   Compared  
with leukemic  cells,  normal  mouse  bone marrow  cells were  shown  to be  
relatively  insensitive to perifosine in vitro.  
 
3.4.2  Animal  studies  
 
The in vivo  activity  of perifosine  has been evaluated  via oral dosing in various  
schedules  in several  transplanted  tumors,  as well as in the 
dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)  induced mammary  tumor  model  of the rat.

 Two tumors  resistant  to conventional cytotoxics  but sensitive  to perifosine  
were  the KB tumor  (squamous  cell) and AsPC -1 (human  pancreatic  
carcinoma).   In vivo , single  oral doses  of 511 mg/kg  completely  inhibited  the 
growth  of subcutaneously  transplanted  KB squamous  cell tumors.  When  
smaller  doses  (203 or 300 mg/kg)  were  administered  twice  at 7 day intervals,  
complete  remissions  lasting  >63 days were  achieved.  Other  xenografts  in nude  
mice  that responded  well to perifosine  included  the Hep-2 laryngeal,  R3327  
rat prostate,  SAS tongue, SC115  mouse  breast  and HCT -8 colon tumor.  
Perifosine  was extremely  active  in the Sprague -Dawley  rat model  of 
dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)  induced mammary  tumors.  Daily  oral 
treatment  using 21.5 mg/kg  for 5 weeks  led to  complete  regre ssions  of tumors.  
Notably,  complete  regressions  over the entire  study  period were  also achieved  
by combining  a high initial  dose of  68.1 mg/kg  followed  by lower  daily doses  
of 2.15 mg/kg  over 20 days,  whereas neither  the loading  dose nor low  
maintenance  doses alone  exhibited  significant  ant-tumor  activity.   Even  large  
(4-8 grams),  established  DMBA induced mammary  tumors  responded to daily  
doses of  14.7 to 68.1 mg/kg  over 28  days, with a persistent  effect  for more  
than 20 days  after cessation  of treatment.  
 
Preclinical  studies  of perifosine  given  as a single oral dose  (10 mg/kg)  
demonstrated  near complete absorption,  with an absolute  bioavailability  of 
81% and 95% in male  and female  rats (Perifosine  Investigator’s  Brochure,  
2003).  For doses ranging  from  1 to 50  mg/kg,  maximum  plasma  
concentration (C max) values  ranged from  0.34 to  10.5 g/mL.   Time  to achieve  
Cmax was reached at a  median  of 16 to  32 hours following  administration  of 
perifosine.  It should be noted  however  that while there  was an approximately  
linear increase  in Cmax from  1 to 10 mg/kg,  a 5-fold increase in dose from 10 
to 50 mg/kg  led only  to a 3-fold increase  in Cmax.  The volume  of distribution  
(Vd) was  twice  the physical  body  volume,  and the terminal  half-life (t1/2) was 
120.5 – 171.4 hours.  
 
A study of  [14C] excretion (urine, feces)  in the rat after an oral dose of  [14C] 
perifosine at 10 and 50 mg/kg  revealed  the following  proportions  of renal  and 
fecal  excretion:

In vitro  binding  of perifosine  to human  serum  albumin  or 1-acid 
glycoprotein  ranged from 92 to 98% (Perifosine  Investigator’s  Brochure,

suggesting  a high binding  capacity  of the plasma  proteins  for perifos ine. 
 
3.4.2.1  Activity  in mouse  gliomas  
 
Perifosine  has been shown  to cross the blood/brain  barrier  in the mouse  as 
the Holland  lab also demonstrated  that PRF also causes reductions  in 
mouse  glioma  cell proliferation  (p<0.005),  as measured  by MIB -1 (Ki67)  
labeling  commonly  used in human  gliomas  as shown  in figure  4.

3.4.3  Preclinical  Toxicity

in the kidneys,  gastrointestinal  tract,  skin, mammary  glands, pituitary,  
hematopoietic  tissue,  spleen,  ovaries,  male  genital  tract,  and eyes (Perifosine

characterized  by an increase  in cellularity  for the bone marrow and an  
increased  extramedullary  hematopoiesis.   Histopathologic  changes  seen in  
other  tissues included  evidence  of chronic  nephropathy,  atrophy  of hair 
follicles,  atrophy  of mammary  glands, reduction  of follicular  development  in 
the ovaries,  degeneration  of the germinal  epithelium  of the testes,

 atrophy/inactivation  of prostate  and seminal  vesicles,  secondary  hypertrophy  
of the Leydig  cells in the testes,  and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of mucosal  
epithelium  cells in stomach  and small  intestine.  All toxicities,  except  those  in 
the male  genital  tract and eyes, were  reversible  within  13 weeks.   Most  
significant  and not clearly  reversible were  ophthalmologic  lesions,  
specifically,  retinal  degeneration  and cataract  formation.   This toxicity  was 
seen in rat but not in dog  toxicity  studies.  Clinical  chemistry  revealed  
reversible  increases  in CK, BUN,  SGOT,  SGPT and reversible  decrease  of red 
blood cell parameters,  total cholesterol,  triglycerides,  inorganic  phosphorus  
and albumin  and total protein.  
 
In dogs, decreased  food consumption,  anorexia,  diarrhea  and vomiting  were  
noted. Clinical  chemistry  revealed  reduced  glucose  levels  in the group  
receiving  the highest  dose.   All changes  were  reversible  during  a 6-week  
recovery  period.    Histopathologically,  minimal  to mild degeneration  of 
proximal  tubular cells of the kidneys  were  found  in male  animals.  
 
The no adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)  was estimated  to be < 2.15 mg/kg  (12.9  
mg/m2) in rats and 2.15  mg/kg (43 mg/m2) in dogs.  
 
3.5 Perifosine  Clinical  Data  
 
Several  Phase  I and II studies  of perifosine  in humans  have been completed  and 
others are on-going  in which  patients experienced  tumor  regressions  and/or  
disease  stabilization.   The safety  profile  of perifosine  is distinctly  different  from  
that of  most  cytotoxic  agents.   It causes  dose-related  nausea, vomiting,  diarrhea  
and fatigue.  The gastrointestinal symptoms  are thought to  arise  primarily  because  
of direct  interactions  between  perifosine  and the gut.  Responding  patients  have  
been treated  with months  to more  than a year with almost  no symptoms  at all. It 
does not cause  myelosuppression,  alopecia,  or rash.   In phase  I studies  it has been  
administered  using a variety  of schedules  including  daily,  weekly,  or daily  after 
an induction  dose.  Responses  have been  seen with both the daily  and weekly  
regimens.   The half-life of the drug exceeds  100 hours.  
 
In preclinical  models,  higher doses have  been shown  to be more  effective than 
lower  doses.  The clinical  responses observed thus far have  been at  lower  doses in  
patients  who have experienced  no toxicity.  Therefore,  MTD may  not be  
required  and a lower  dose may actually be superior  clinically.

 3.5.1  Clinical  Results:  European  Phase  I Trials  
 
Asta Medica/Zentaris  sponsored  three  European  phase I trials of perifosine  
evaluating  weekly  and daily dosing,  as well as an enteric -coated  formulation.  
 
Study D-21266 -3040  
 
This was a phase  I study  of escalating  doses of  perifosine  given  on a weekly  
schedule.  Thirty -six patients  were  treated  in sequential  cohorts  at dose levels  
of 100, 200,  350, 450, 600 and 800 mg/week.   At 350 mg weekly, grade 3  
vomiting  occurred  in the  first two patients.   These patients  responded  to 
antiemetic  prophylaxis with  tropisetron,  alizaprid,  and dexamethasone,  and all  
subsequent  patients  received  antiemetic  prophylaxis.   Among  7 patients  
treated  at the maximum  dose of  800 mg/wk  all taken  together at one time,  
grade 2 nausea  and vomiting  of residual  perifosine  tablets  and grade 4  
diarrhea  occurred.   In addition  to nausea,  vomiting  and diarrhea  the following  
grade 1/2  events  were reported  to be  likely  caused  by the drug:  gastritis,  
erythematous  rash, abdominal  pain, fatigue,  bradycardia,  increased  sweating  
and arthralgia.  Preliminary  data from  analyzed plasma  samples of  patients  
receiving  perifosine in the dose range of 100 to 600  mg indicated  a dose - 
linearity of Cmax and of  the area under  the concentration time  curve  (AUC)  in 
this dose range.  However, at 800 mg/week,  the dose-AUC and Cmax 
proportionality was  reduced.   Cmax  and t 1/2 values  ranged from  8 – 25 hours  
and 96 – 225 hours, respectively  (Perifosine Investigator’s  Brochure,  2003).  
After  repeated  dosing a  slight  accumulation  of perifosine  was seen, which  is 
in accordance  with the relatively prolonged  terminal  t1/2 of the agent.  
Perifosine  was not detectable  in the patients'  urine.

Efficacy  was not a primary  end point  of this phase  I study;  however,  indicator  
lesions were evaluated  every  8 weeks,  if possible.   Patient  diagnoses  included  
NSCLC (7 patients),  melanoma  (4), colorectal carcino ma (4), head and neck  
cancer  (5), sarcoma  (4), mesothelioma  (2), hepatocellular  carcinoma  (1), 
esophageal carcinoma  (2), SCLC (1), corpus carcinoma  (1), bladder  (1), breast

In the second  phase I study,  22 patients  received  perifosine at escalating  doses  
of 50-350 mg daily for 21 days in every  28 day cycle.  Fatigue  (43%), nausea  
(52%), vomiting  (38%)  and diarrhea  (43%)  were the  most  frequent toxicities  
experienced  by patients  on this study.  The maximum  tolerated  dose on this  
study was 200 mg/day.   Three  of six patients  treated  at 250 mg/day  and the 
one patient  treated  at 350 mg/day  had intolerable fatigue  and/or  gastro -

 3.5.2  Clinical  Results:  US Phase  I Trials  
 
The Division  of Cancer  Treatment  and Diagnosis,  National Cancer  Institute  
sponsored two phase I trials  of perifosine  evaluating  a loading  dose followed  
by daily maintenance  dose schedule.  A loading dose/daily  maintenance  
schedule was proposed due to improved  efficacy  in several  preclinical cancer  
models  with this schedule  and the fact that daily  doses  alone  required  some  
days (and possible  more  than a week) to reach  steady  state plasma  levels.  A 
loading dose could potentially  achieve  active  anti-tumor  serum  concentrations  
followed  by tolerable  daily  maintenance  dosing.  Since  both preclinical  
studies  and the earlier  phase  I studies had suggested  that increases  in plasma  
levels  were not linear  after a threshold  that might  be about 400 mg, the 
loading dose was  fractionated  and administered  every  6 hours  to improve  
bioavailability and decrease  Cmax.  It was also anticipated  that by lowering  
Cmax toxicities  such as emesis  might  be decreased.  In both studies,  patients  
received  antiemetic  prophylaxis  with dexamethasone  and 5HT3  antagonist  
before  initial  loading  dose.  Similar  to the results from  the Asta Medica - 
sponsored studies,  the most  frequently  observed toxicities in NCI sponsored  
phase I studies  were  gastrointestinal (nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea)  and fatigue.  
Chronic  nausea  among  patients  receiving  perifosine  appears  to resolve  
approximately  48 hours following  discontinuation  of therapy.  In contrast,  
fatigue  may persist  for weeks  after therapy  has ended.  
 
Phase  I evaluation  of the “Intermittent  Schedule” at the NCI 
 
The first trial examined  a loading dose on day 1 followed  by a maintenance  
dose schedule  for 20 days in patients with  solid  tumors  repeated  every 28  
days.  (Because  of the 7 day intervals  without  drug,  this has  been referred  to 
as the “intermittent  schedule.”)  In an attempt  to minimize  nausea, doses  
were  administered  with meals  or, with maintenance  doses, at bedtime.  In 
addition,  prior  to the initial loading dose,  patients were  given  granisetron,  
metoclopramide,  diphenhydramine,  and dexamethasone  as antiemetic  
prophylaxis.  Thirty -one patients  were  treated  on this study.  Gastrointestinal  
toxicities  were  dose limiting.  Dose  limiting  nausea and vomiting  despite  
antiemetic  prophylaxis  occurred  with loading doses  of 1200 -1500  mg.  Grade  
3 arthralgias and arthritis in the form of gout or pseudo -gout were  seen in two 
patients  taking  perifosine  200 mg/day.  One patient  with a history  of gout had 
reappearance  of gout and one patient  without a prior  history  had an episode  of 
pseudogout.  One patient with  a history  of hyperuricemia,  had grade 2  
episodes of  gout.  Persistent  grade  2 nausea and  vomiting  despite antiemet ics 
and fatigue occurred  with a maintenance  dose of  200 mg/day.  The maximum  
tolerated  dose (MTD)  and recommended  phase II dose (RP2D)  were  
established  as: Cycle  1: 900/150 mg loading/maintenance  dose and for

subsequent  cycles:  300/150  mg loading/maintenance  dose ([19]).   The day 1  
loading dose was  divided  into 2 equal doses of  450 mg taken with food,  6 
hours apart on day 1. Among  11 patients  treated  at the  MTD/RP2D,  no 
patients  experienced  grade  3-4 dose  limiting  events  during  the loading dose or 
maintenance  dose periods  in the first cycle.  Only  one other grade  3 toxicity,  
infection  without  neutropenia,  felt to be probably  due to the drug was 
recorded  at dose level  III. Grade  1-2 fatigue  occurred  in 8/11 patients  and 
grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity  was intermittent and  tolerable.  
 
Gastrointestinal  toxicities  experienced  on this trial are summarized  in the  
following  table:

Phase  I evaluation  of the “Continuous  Schedule”  at the University  of 
Wisconsin  
 
The second  NCI sponsored phase I  trial evaluated  a loading dose followed  by 
a continuous  maintenance  dose schedule  in 42 patients  with advanced  cancer.  
The loading  dose was only given  in course  one, and maintenance  dosing  
continued without a scheduled  break  (hence  the name  “continuous schedule”).  
Cohorts  of patients  received  loading/maintenance  doses ranging  from  400/50  
– 1200/150 mg.  In this  study, loading  doses were  split into 4-8 equal doses

given at 6 hour intervals.   Patients  received  dexamethasone  and dolasetron  
mesylate  prior  to each dose during  the loading period  with lorazepam  and 
prochlorperazine  prn.  Reported  severe  toxicities  for this trial include  
anorexi a, fatigue,  dehydration,  nausea/vomiting,  constipation,  diarrhea,  
elevated  liver function  tests,  and decreased  hemoglobin.   The MTD and 
recommended  phase II dose for this schedule was 900 mg loading dose  
(divided  into 6 equal doses  of 150 mg taken with food q 6 hourly) followed  by 
100 mg daily  maintenance.   Among  14 patients  treated  at the MTD,  there  
were  4 grade  3 events  (fatigue in 2 patients,  nausea  in 1 and vomiting  in 1 
patient).   Subsequently  a review  of the pharmacokinetics  for this study  
revealed  that there  was only a minimal  increase  in plasma  concentration  
between  dose level  3 and  dose level  4.  For this reason  the actual  doses used in 
subsequent  phase II  studies  were a loading  dose of 600 mg (150 x 4) and  a 
maintenance  dose of  100 mg.  Among the 12 patients  treated  at dose  level  2 
there were  3 patients  who experienced  grade 3 fatigue  and 1 patient  with grade  
3 nausea.  There  were  no additional  grade  3 toxicities  recorded  as probably  
due to the drug.  
 
The gastrointestinal toxicities  experienced  on this protocol  are summarized  in 
the following  table:

In the phase II program  initiated  by the National Cancer  Institute trials  were

than the  continuous  regimen.

Perifosine  201 
 
AOI Pharmaceuticals is currently  undertaking  a phase  I/II trial  of perifosine  in 
non-small  cell lung cancer.   In this study  patients receive  weekly  doses in  
which  the total dose is divided  into 300 mg doses delivered  at least  4 hours  
apart.  Dosing  began at  900 mg (300 mg x 3) and was escalated  to 1800  mg 
(300 mg x 6).  A  dose limiting  toxicity  was defined  as a grade  3 or 4  
gastrointestinal  toxicity  or nausea  and/or  vomiting  lasting  more  than 48 hours.  
Two patients  at 1800 mg experienced  grade 3 diarrhea,  and 1500  mg was the  
maximum tolerated dose.  The GI toxicities encountered  in the  initial  3 
cohorts of  patients  are described  in the following  table.  The table  reflects the 
first week  of therapy only.

coated  tablet.    When  doses above 300 mg were  administered  at a single time,  
the pharmacokinetics  were  not linear.   Two patients  on the phase  I studies  
responded:  one patient on the study  that utilized  the enteric coated  tablets  (D- 
21266 -3087) had serum  values ranging  from  2.78 – 6.29 M and one patient  
on the continuous  regimen  had steady  state levels  of 12.78 ± 2.23 M.

3.5.4  Results  of Phase  II conducted  by NCI 
 
The results of three of  the nine NCI phase II  studies  have been  presented  at 
national  and international  meetings.  None  has yet been published  in a full 
report.  
 
A multicenter  Phase  II Consortium  organized  by the Mayo  Clinic  and lead by 
Howard  Bailey  of the University  of Wisconsin  evaluated  the continuous  
regimen  in 23 patients  with soft tissue sarcomas.  The results were  reported  at 
the EORTC -NCI-AACR  meeting  on Molecular  Targets and Cancer  
Therapeutics.  The median  age of  the patients  was 53 (range 24-77). Eight  
were  male  and 15 female.  Thirteen  had an ECOG performance  status  of 0 and  
10 had a PS=1.  Twenty  patients  had received  prior  chemotherapy,  and 5  
patients  (22%)  had liver metastases.  Grade  3 toxicities  definitely  or probably  
related  to the drug include d fatigue  in 2 patients and diarrhea,  anorexia  and/or  
dehydration,  each in 1 patient.   One patient  had a  partial response  and five 
patients  were  stable  for 84-229 days.  The responder  was a 58-year-old man 
with an extra -skeletal  myxoid  chondrosarcoma.   The primary  lesion on  the 
thigh had been  treated  8 years previously,  and metastases to the lung and the 
lymph  nodes had been identified  22 months  prior  to starting  perifosine.  The 
patient  had previously  been  treated  with surgery,  radiother apy and 
chemotherapy  consisting  of gemcitabine  and cisplatin.  He had not responded  
to the chemotherapy.   The patient  received  10 months  of perifosine  therapy  
(600 mg loading dose and 100 mg/day  continuously).   He had grade 1 nausea  
and diarrhea on cycle 1 only and no toxicities  of any type after that point.  The 
primary  endpoint of  the study was 6 month  progression -free survival.   In 
addition  to the responder,  two other  patients  (one with a myxoid  sarcoma  and 
one with a desmoid  tumor) had disease  stabilization  for more  than six months.  
 
Nineteen  patients  with head and neck  cancers  were  enrolled  in a phase II trial 
conducted by a consortium  of hospitals in Chicago,  and results  from  this study  
were  presented  at the Third  Chicago  International Symposium on 
Malignancies  of the Chest  and Head  and Neck.   The patients had a median  age 
59 (range 46-81; 15 were  male  and 4  female.  Five had an ECOG performance  
status of  0 and the remainder  had a status  of 1. Thirteen  of these  patients had 
received  prior  chemotherapy  and 12  had prior  radiotherapy.  The continuous  
regimen  was used with a starting  dose of 600 mg in 4 divided  doses followed  
by a daily dose of 100mg.  The investigators reported  that administration  by 
gastrostomy  tube was feasible.  Grade  3 toxicities described  in their 
presentation  included pain in one patient  and hypercalcemia  in another.  
Seventeen  patients  were evaluable  for response.  There  were no objective  
responses but one patient  had stable disease for 4 cycles.

The only phase  II trial of breast cancer  enrolled  18 (17 evaluable)  patients.  
This trial was presented  at the 2005  San Antonio  Breast  Cancer  Symposium  
before  the study  was officially  closed.   In this  trial the intermittent  regimen  
was used. The patients’ median  age was 52 (range  28-69). There  was 1 male  
patient.    The ECOG performance  status  was 0 for 10, 1 for 6, and 2 for 1 
patient.    Eight  patients  had tumors  that were  ER/PR positive,  but none had 
HER2/ neu positive  tumors.   This was a heavily  pre-treated  population.  
Sixteen  patients  had received  prior  systemic  therapy  including  neoadjuvant  or 
adjuvant  chemotherapy  in 11, a single  chemotherapy  regimen  for metastatic  
disease  in 5 patients,  and two prior chemotherapy  regimens  for metastases  in 
9.  Fifteen  patients  had previously  received  an anthracycline and 11 a prior  
taxane.   Drug  related  toxicities included  Grade 3 diarrhea  (2 patients),  
vomiting  (2 patients),  nausea  (1 patient)  and fatigue  (1 patient).  One patient  
had a mixed  response after 2 cycles  and 2 patients were  stable for  4 months.  
The mixed  response occurred  in a patient  with extensive  disease  involving  
multiple  organs.  At the end of 2 cycles some  lesions  had shrunk  while  others  
had remained  stable  or increased.   Although  this patient  had experienced  no 
major  toxicities,  she refused  further treatment  for unspecified  reasons.  
 
3.5.5  Description  of the responders  in previous  phase  I/II 
trials  
 
Three  patients  have had  clearly  documented  partial  responses on earlier  
perifosine trials.  
 
Patient  # 1 (D 21266 -3079) was a 66 year old with a chondrosarcoma  with a 
primary  in the Xiphoid.  The patient had local  recurrences  treated  surgically  at 
4 and 10 months.   At 10 months  distant  metastases  were  also documented.  
Previous  chemotherapy  included 2  cycles  of Adriamycin,  cisplatin  and 
ifosfamide.   The patient  received  24 weeks  of enteric -coated  perifosine at a 
dose of  350 mg per week  and was then taken off study due to  non-compliance.  
The plasma  perifosine levels  ranged  from  2.78 – 6.29 M. Only  minimal  
toxicity  was observed until week  22 when  the patient  had grade  3 nausea  and 
vomiting  along  with grade  2 fatigue  from weeks  20-24. The sum of products  
of lesions in  the lung and sternum  decreased  from 28.56 at on -study to 9.39 at 
the conclusion  of treatment.  
 
Patient  # 2 (Phase  I trial of continuous  regimen)  was a 50 year old with a 
leiomyosarcoma  with a primary  in the uterus.  She developed  distant  
metastases  at 4 years with lesions  in the scalp,  lung,  retroperitoneum  and 
bone.  She had previously  received  two cycles of  adriamycin  and dacarbazine  
as well as strontium  for bone metastases.   The patient  received  a loading  dose

 of 600 mg and then continuous  daily  perifosine at  50 mg/day  for 504 days.  
The patient was  taken off study at that time due to patient  refusal  for further  
therapy.  The patient  experienced  absolutely  no toxicity  while on study.  The 
patient  had disease  in both lungs as  well as an  infrasplenic  mass.  The 
measurements  on the patient’s  disease  were  scored  by 3 independent  
observers.  At the time the patient  went  off study the average decrease  in 
measurements  was scored  as 62% (range  53 – 70%).  The patient remains  in 
partial remission  after 3 years.  
 
Patient  # 3 (Mayo  Clinic phase II  trial)  was a 58 year old with an extra - 
skeletal  myxoid  chondrosarcoma  with a primary  on the thigh.  The patient’s  
disease was metastatic to the lung and the lymph  nodes.  The patient  was 
previously  treated  with surgery,  radiotherapy  and chemotherapy  consisting  of 
gemcitabine and cisplatin.   The patient  was treated  with 10 cycles  of therapy  
(600 mg loading dose and 100 mg/day  continuously)  and had  grade 1 nausea  
and diarrhea on cycle 1 only 
 
3.6 Potential  impact  on metabolism  by hepatic  enzyme  
inducing  antiepileptic  drugs  (EIAEDs)  
 
There  is increasing  evidence  that brain  tumor  patients receiving  enzyme -inducing  
anti-epileptic  drugs (EIAEDs)  have  markedly  altered  pharmacokinetics,  resulting  
in accelerated  drug metabolism.  This may result  in decreased  levels  of certain  
chemotherapeutic agents  when  administered  at conventional doses. Failure  to 
achieve  adequate  plasma  levels  of such agents  may account for the lack  of 
efficacy  in past brain  tumor  trials.  
 
Perifosine is a potential substrate  for the cytochrome  P450  system,  and the  
escalating  concentrations  of perifosine  were  tested  for inhibition  of the liver 
microsomal  cytochrome  P450  system  in vitro  (table  10). Enzyme  activities  
associated  with CYPlA2  (7-ethoxyresorufin  0-deethylation),  CYP2A6  (coumarin  
7-hydroxylation),  CYP2B6  (S-mephenytoin  N-demethylation),  CYP2C9  
(tolbutamide  methyl -hydroxylation),  CYP2C19  (S-mephenytoin  4'- 
hydroxylation),  CYP2D6  (dextromethorphan  0-demethyla tion),  CYP2E1  
(chlorzoxazone  6-hydroxylation)  and CYP3A415  (testosterone  6P-hydroxylation)  
were  determined  using  enzyme -specific  probe compounds  incubated with pooled  
human  liver microsomal  samples.  
 
In the presence  of perifosine,  a moderate inhibitory  effect  was observed on 
CYP2A6  activity  (50%),  and a slight inhibitory  effect  on CYP3A4  activity  (29%),  
in both cases  only at  the highest  concentration  (100 yM). No inhibitory  effect  was 
observed on  CYP2C19  activity  by perifosine  at any of the concentrations tested.

These  data suggest  that patients  taking  EIAEDs  may have increased  drug 
metabolism and a higher MTD than patients  who are not  taking  EIAEDs.  
Therefore,  to avoid the  possibility  of effects  of EIAEDs  on the metabol ism of 
perifosine,  and vice-versa,  only patients  not taking  EIAEDs  will be eligible  for 
this trial as has become  common  in trials  of novel agents  for malignant  glioma.  
(See Appendix  20.2 for a list of EIAED drugs).  
 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.1 Design  
Only  patients  not taking  EIAEDs  will be considered  for this study.   If patients  
were  previously  on EIAEDs  that have been discontinued,  patients  must  have been  
off the agent for at least 2 weeks  prior  to registration.   For patients  who need to 
start an AED or the AED needs to be changed, it is strongly  recommended  that all 
efforts  should  be made  to use a non-EIAED.  If another non-EIAED cannot be  
used, the PI or co-PI should  be notified  immediately.  Questio ns regarding  these  
requirements  should be  discussed with PI or co-PI. 
 
Surgery  
In addition,  if cytoreductive  surgery  is recommended as part of the standard  
of care  for tumor  recurrence,  all patients  will be  considered for the “surgical

 arm” of the trial.    In this case, patients  will receive  perifosine  for 5-10 days  
before  surgery  during  which tumor  will be aliquoted both for diagnostic  
purposes  and for molecular  and pharmacokinetic  analyses.  Ideally,  tissue  
will be available  from a  prior  surgical  resection for intra -patient  comparison.  
Following  recovery from  surgery,  patients  will restart  perifosine  until either  
tumor  progression (as determined by  brain imaging  with CT or MRI every 2  
months)  or toxicity.   All patients  will be followed for overall  survival after  
discontinuing  perifosine.  
Biologic impact  will also be determined by  periodic  FDG -PET imaging  (see 
below).  
 
4.1.1 Patients  will also be stratified as follows:  
 
Histology  at Registration:   
GBM/Gliosarcoma  (GBM/GS)  
Anaplastic Astrocytoma  (AA)  
Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma  (AO)  
Anaplastic Mixed Glioma  (AMG)  
 
 
Pre-operative  Candidate:  Yes or No 
Measurable/Evaluable  disease:  Yes or No 
4.2  Intervention  
 
Following  a diagnosis  of tumor  recurrence  or progression,  all patients  will 
receive  perifosine  monotherapy  until  toxicity,  progression,  or death.   Brain  
imaging  (MRI/CT)  will be  performed at baseline  and every 2 months  
(standard of  care).  FDG -PET imaging  will be performed at baseline,  after 1- 
2 weeks  of therapy,  and every 4 months  to assist  with interpretation of tumor  
response.  MR Spectroscopy  and MR Perfusion may also  be performed with  
every MRI to assist  with interpr etation of tumor  response.   Patients  on the 
surgical  arm trial will resume  perifosine  after recovering  from surgery  and 
continue  until toxicity,  progression,  or death.

• Patients  with a history  of any oth er cancer (except  non-melanoma  skin cancer  
or carcinoma  in-situ of the cervix),  unless  in complete remission  and off of all 
therapy for that  disease  for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible.  
 
• Patients  must  not have  active infection  or serious intercurrent medical  illness.  
 
• HIV-Positive  patients receiving  combination  anti-retroviral therapy  are 
excluded from the study  due to possible  retro-viral drug interactions.  
 
• Patients  must  not have  any disease  that will obscure  toxicity  or dangerously  
alter drug metabolism.  
 
• Surgical  arm only:  Patients  must  not have received  prior  therapy  with signal  
transduction  inhibitors (including  but not limited  to ZD1839/gefitinib/Iressa,  
OSI-774/erlotinib/Tarceva,  rapamycin/sirolimus,  CCI-779/temsirol imus,  STI- 
571/imatinib/Gleevec,  bevacizumab/Avastin,  VEGF -Trap,  AZD2171,  
sorafinib,  sunitinib).   Any questions  about the  eligibility  based  on prior  
treatments  should be discussed  with the PI or co-PI. 
 
 
7.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN  
 
Patients  will be recruited  from  the neurology and  neuro -surgery  services  at MSKCC.   All 
patients  will be seen by  a neuro -oncology  attending.   All patients  entered  in the protocol  
will give written  informed  consent.  There  are no gender  or racial  restrictions.  
 
8.1 PRE TREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
The following  studies  are required  within  two weeks  prior  to starting  perifosine:  
 
• Complete  history  and physical  exam  including  neurologic  exam and KPS.  
• Height  and weight.  
• CBC including  WBC differential  and platelet count.

 • Comprehensive  chemistry  panel.  
• Uric Acid  
• Contrast enhanced  MRI (with  MR Perfusion  if possible)  of the brain. The same  
type of  scan,  i.e., MRI  or CT, should be used throughout  the period  of protocol  
treatment  for tumor  measurement.  Patients  unable  to undergo  an MRI  will 
undergo contrast  enhanced  CT scans.  It also must  be performed  at least  28 days  
after discontinuation  of prior  therapy  directed  at VEGF/VEGFR such as  
bevacizumab  (Avastin),  VEGF -Trap,  or AZD2171.   Any questions regarding  the 
definition  of anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy should be discussed  with the PI or co-PI. 
• Brain FDG -PET:  It also must  be performed  at least 28 days after discontinuation  
of prior therapy  directed  at VEGF/VEGFR such as bevacizumab  (Avastin),  VEGF - 
Trap,  or AZD2171.  Any questions  regarding  the definition  of anti -VEGF/VEGFR  
therapy should  be discussed  with the PI or co-PI. 
• All brain PET scans  must  be performed on MSKCC scanners  for adequate  
ability  to compare  scans  over time.  
• For patients with  histologically  documented  malignant  gliomas  who will receive  
perifosine  for their 2nd or greater relapse,  the date that the most  recent therapy  was 
started  will be recorded  and used to  calculate the time to the  prior  relapse for  
comparison  with time to progression  on perifosine  (intrapatient  comparison).  
 
 
9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
Dosing  will be continuous,  and for the purpose of this trial a cycle will be defined  as 
28 days.  
 
9.2 Dosing  
Perifosine  will be given  as a 600 mg loading dose on day 1.  The loading dose will be 
divided  into 4 equal doses  of 150 mg each.  The first 3 doses  should  be given  with 
food in the adult  day hospital  to allow intravenous  antiemetic prophylaxis,  and 4th 
dose at bedtime  at home.  The interval between  doses  of perifosine  should  be no less  
than 4 hours.   On day 2, patients  will start  the maintenance  dose of 100 mg daily at 
bedtime  at home.  
 
9.3 Pharmacokinetics/drug  concentration in tumor tissue (all patients)  
In addition  to baseline  serum,  all patients  will have weekly  serum  drawn  during  
weeks  2-4. Patients  in surgical  arm of the trial will  have blood  drawn  at baseline  
and during surgery  to determine  the concentration  of perifosine  in serum  at the  
time of surgery.  Tissue will  also be collected  for determination  of the 
concentration  of perifosine  in tumor  tissue  relative  to simultaneously  collected  
serum.   The date and  time of blood collection  should  be recorded.  In addition,  the 
date and  time of the most  recent  dose of pre-surgical  perifosine  should be  
recorded.

 9.4 Treatment modifications  (all patients)  
 
For grade 1 perifosine related  adverse  events,  treatment  with perifosine  will not 
be interrupted.  
 
For grade 2 perifosine related  adverse  events  
 
For nausea,  vomiting  and diarrhea,  maintain  dosing with symptomatic  
treatment.   The dose of  perifosine  may be repeated  if emesis  occurs within  30 
minutes  of taking the  tablet(s)  OR all the tablets are seen in the emesis.  
 
For persistent  nausea, vomiting  or diarrhea,  or other  persistent  grade 2  adverse  
events despite  symptomatic treatment,  the daily  dose will be reduced by  50 
mg. 
 
For grade 3 or 4 perifosine  related  adverse  events  
 
Hold  perifosine  and re-evaluate  the patient  at least weekly  until toxicity  
improves  to < grade 2 (grade  0 or 1). 
 
If the toxicity  resolves  in 7 days or less, maintenance  (daily)  perifosine  should  
be restarte d but the daily  dose will be reduced by  50 mg. 
 
If the toxicity  resolves  in 8-14 days, the patient  will take another  loading  dose 
before  reinitiating  daily  maintenance  but the  load will by reduced  by 200 mg 
to 400 mg and the maintenance  will be reduced  to 50 mg. The loading dose 
will be divided  into 4 equal  doses of  100 mg each.  The first 3 doses should  be 
given with food in the adult  day hospital  to allow intravenous  antiemetic  
prophylaxis,  and 4th dose at bedtime  at home.  The interval between  doses  of 
perifosine  should  be no  less than 4 hours.  
 
If toxicity  does not resolve  within  14 days, the patient  will be withdrawn  from  
the study.  
 
9.5 Treatment Schedule  for patients  participating  in the Pre-operative  study:  
 
Patients  who are candidates  for surgical resection  of recurrent  disease  will be 
considered  for a pre-operative  study  to evaluate  biological/tissue  correlates.  
Patients  who choose to  participate in  this component  of the study must  have a  
brain MRI (with  MR Perfusion  if possible)  performed  within  14 days of  taking  
pre-operative  perifosine.   Patients  unable  to undergo  MRI will have  CT scans.  A  
brain FDG -PET scan must  also be performed  within 14 days  of taking pre- 
operative  perifosine.   The drug will be administered  for 5-10 days prior  to the 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center

 surgery.  The last dose will be given  the night  before  surgery.   Patients on the  
surgical  arm will  also undergo  a pre-operative  FDG -PET following  at least 5 days  
of perifosine and before surgery  to correlate  metabolic and tissue  effects during  
treatment.  
 
Day of Surgery : Prior to the surgical procedure,  tissue  freezer vials should  be 
labeled  with the patient’s  protocol  study  identifier  number(s).  Additionally,  a 
thermos  with liquid nitrogen  (preferably),  or if not possible,  an ice bucket  with 
dry ice should  be prepared.  All attempts  will be made  to obtain  specimens  
immediately  adjacent  to the areas  of resection  taken  for “permanent  sections”  in 
order to optimize  the likelihood  that the tumor  seen on permanent  sections  is 
representative  of that taken  for analysis.   Once  the pathologist  has made  a 
diagnosis of  "tumor"  on frozen section  at the  time of surgical  resection,  the tumor  
tissue  should  be divided  into 50 – 100mg  pieces.  
 
At the time of surgery 10ml  of blood will be collected  for pharmacodynamic  
analysis.  
 
Following  surgery:  A post-operative MRI/CT scan  should be  done no later than 
96 hours from surgery . Once  patients  have recovered  from  the effects  of surgery  
and demonstrated  wound  healing,  they will restart perifosine (load  and 
maintenance).   Patients  are not required  to have  residual  disease  to continue  
perifosine.  Treatment  with perifosine  post-operatively  should  start a minimum of 
7 days after surgery.  If more  than 14 days have  passed since the post-operative  
MRI was performed,  new baseline brain  MRI (with  MR Perfusion  if possible)  and 
brain FDG -PET sans must  be performed.  
 
9.6 Supportive  Care  Guidelines  (all patients)  
 
9.6.1 Antiemetic  prophylaxis  
 
Patients  are to be instructed  that perifosine  is to be taken with food.  Patients  
will maintain  a daily patient treatment  diary  to track  when  they take each dose 
of perifosine and return  the diary  to the clinic  each week  along  with any 
remaining  medication.  The pills should  remain  intact  and should  not be split 
unless a gastrostomy  tube is being  used.  
 
All patients should have  antiemetic medications prescribed  and administered  
as needed, and adjusted  during the cycle  at the discretion  of the treating  
investigator.  
 
Patients  should  receive  an oral or  IV prophylactic antiemetic regimen.  The 
regimen  to be used is at the discretion  of the treating  investigator.  
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  06-044 A(11)  
Amended:   10/25/11  
- 36 -  
 Premedication  with a 5HT3  blocker  with dexamethasone is recommended.  
 
9.6.2 Diarrhea  Management  
 
All patients should be instructed  to take loperamide  at the earliest  signs  of 
diarrhea  and/or  abdominal  cramping  after beginning  study medication.  This 
can include (a) loose  stool,  (b) the occurrence  of 1 to 2 more  bowel  
movements  than usual  in 1 day, or (c) an unusually  high volume  of stool.  
 
Loperamide  should be dosed  in the following  manner:  4 mg at the first onset  
of diarrhea,  then 2 mg every 2 hours  around the  clock until diarrhea  free for  at 
least 12 hours.  Patients may  take 4 mg every 4 hours during  the night.  
 
Additional  antidiarrheal measures  may be used at the discretion  of the treating  
physician  as warranted  by the patient’s  condition.  
 
9.6.3 Hyperuricemia  Prophylaxis  
 
Prior  to beginning  perifosine,  all patients  should  be questioned  about a history  
of hyperuricemia  and/or gout.  Patients  with a known  history  of hyperuricemia  
and/or gout should receive  prophylactic treatment  with allopurinol  300 mg po 
daily.  If severe gout does occur or uric acid levels  increase,  the dose of  
allopurinol should  be increased  at physician  discretion.  
 
9.6.4 G-CSF Administration  
 
Routine  prophylactic  use of G-CSF is not permitted.  However,  therapeutic  
use in patients  with serious  neutropenic  complications,  such as sepsis,  may 
be considered  at the  investigator’s  discretion  
 
9.6.5 Other  Concomitant  Medications  
 
Therapies  considered  necessary  for the  well being  of the patient  may be given  
at the discretion  of the investigator.  Other  concomitant  medications  should  be 
avoided except  for analgesics,  chronic  treatments  for concomitant  medical  
conditions,  or agents  required  for life-threatening  medical  problems.   All 
concomitant  medications  must  be recorded.  
 
9.6.6 Other  Anticancer  or Experimental  Therapies  
 
No other anticancer  therapy  (including  chemotherapy,  radiation,  hormonal  
treatment  or immunotherapy)  of any kind is permitted  during  the study period.  
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  06-044 A(11)  
Amended:   10/25/11  
- 37 -  
 No other drug under investigation  may be used concomitantly  with the study  
drug.  
 
9.6.7 Surgery  
 
If neurosurgical  management  is required for reasons  not due  to tumor  
progression,  these procedures  must  be documented,  including  the indications  
for surgery,  the surgical operative  note and pathology  report.  
 
9.6.8 Corticosteroids  should be used in  the smallest  dose to control symptoms  of 
cerebral  edema  and mass  effect,  and discontinued  if possible.  
 
Anti-seizure  medications  should be used as indicated.   However,  only patients  
not taking  EIAEDs  are eligible  to enroll  on this trial.  Patients who  were  
previously  on a non-EIAED and need to change  anticonvulsants  should be 
started  on another  non-EIAED if at all possible.  No delays  in treatment  would  
be required.  Patients  who were  previously  on no  anticonvulsants  should be 
treated  with non-EIAEDs  if at all possible.  If for unavoidable clinical reasons  
(severe  allergies,  toxicities  etc.) a patient is started  on an EIAED,  he/she  
should immediately  be started  on another  non-EIAED and the EIAED should  
be tapered  and discontinued  as quickly  as possible.  The patient  may continue  
the current treatment  dose while  a non- EIAED is re-started  because an  
EIAED will  likely  increase  metabolism of perifosine, reducing  rather  than 
increasing  any potential anti -tumor  effect  and therefore  any efficacy  bias 
introduced  would  be negative  rather than positive.  
 
Patients  who were  previously  on a non-EIAED and need to permanently  
change anticonvulsant,  but who cannot change  to another non-EIAED  may 
continue  the current  treatment  dose for the next 2 weeks  while  an EIAED is 
started.  FOLLOWING  THIS PERIOD,  THE SUBSEQUENT  TREATMENT  
DOSE  MUST  BE DISCUSSED  WITH THE  PI OR CO-PI. Treatment  may be 
allowed  to continue if the patient  is felt to be deriving  clinical benefit.   In 
some  cases this dose may be higher  than the previously  used dose.  
 
 
10.0  EVALUATION DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
10.1 Clinical  
 
History  and physical  examination  (including  vital signs, weight  and KPS)  will be 
performed  at each clinic visit.  Patients  will have a follow up physical  exam 1 week  after 
the patient starts treatment  and every  first week  of each subsequent  cycle (4 week  
period).

 A diary should  be completed  by the patient  each week  to score  duration  and severity  of 
gastrointestinal  side effects.   Patients will  also maintain  a weekly  patient treatment  diary  
to track  doses  of perifosine  taken at home  and return  the diary  to the clinic each week.  
 
10.2 Laboratory  
 
A CBC with  differential and serum  chemistry  will be performed  1 week  after the patient  
starts  treatment,  and every  first week  of each subsequent cycle.

Serum  pregnancy test should  be obtained  within  72 hours prior  to the initiation  of therapy  
for women  of childbearing  potential.  
 
10.3 Imaging  and Molecular Studies  
 
Patients not on the surgical  arm will undergo imaging  evaluation  with brain  MRI (with  
MR Perfusion  and MR  spectroscopy  if possible)  at baseline and every 8  weeks   Patients  
unable to undergo  MRI will  have CT scans.  Patients  will also undergo FDG -PET 
imaging  of the brain  (at MSKCC)  at baseline  and every 16 weeks  (4 cycles)  to assist with  
interpretation  of MRI.  Patients  will also undergo  a brain FDG -PET scan after 1-2 weeks  
of therapy at  MSKCC to investigate  potential  metabolic effects  of perifosine  and to  
explore  early  FDG -PET as a predictor  of response  by clinical and radiographic  
evaluations performed  later.

 Patients on the surgical  arm will undergo  baseline imaging  evaluation  with brain MRI 
(with  MR Perfusion  and MR Spectroscopy  if possible)  and FDG -PET at MSKCC no 
more  than 2  weeks  before  pre-operative  perifosine.   Patients  on the surgical  arm will also 
undergo a pre-operative FDG -PET at MSKCC  following  at least 5 days of  perifosine and  
before  surgery  to correlate  metabolic and tissue  effects  during  treatment.  After  surgery,  a 
brain MRI must  also be  performed  no more  than 2 weeks  before  initiation  of post- 
operative  perifosine.  It is expected  that in most  cases, the post-operative MRI  (performed  
within  96 hours  after surgery)  will suffice  and function as the new baseline  scan before  
initiation  of post-operative  perifosine.   Patients  unable  to undergo  MRI will have  CT 
scans.  FDG -PET does not need to be repeated  post-operatively  before  re-initiating  
perifosine.  Patients  will then undergo  brain MRI every 8 weeks  (with  MR Perfusion  if 
possible)  and brain FDG -PET every  16 weeks  (4 cycles)  at MSKCC to assist with 
interpretation  of MRI.  
 
Fifteen  unstained  paraffin  slides  and 100 mg of flash  frozen  tissue  will be used to  
evaluate  the effect  of perifosine  on PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK signaling,  the effect on 
proliferation,  and other  molecular effects.  In addition,  100 mg of flash  frozen  tissue and 
one tube of  serum  will be collected  for pharmacokinetic  analysis.  
 
All patients : The brain  MRI,  MR Perfusion,  MR Spectroscopy  and FDG -PET scans will 
be used for clinical care and be billed  to insurance/patient  with the exception  of the FDG - 
PET performed  after 1-2 weeks  of therapy which  is research  in nature..   In addition,  such 
scans will be used to determine  effects  of perifosine  on tumor  blood flow and 
metabolism.  
 
If available,  15 unstained  paraffin  slides  and flash  frozen  tissue will  be obtained  from  the 
surgery closest  to initiation  of this clinical trial.  These  will be used to evaluate  molecular  
markers  that could predict  glioma  sensitivity  to perifosine  such as a PI3K/AKT activity,  
RAS/MAPK  activity,  proliferation  rate, and somatic  mutations of potential oncogenes or 
tumor  suppressor genes  in tumor  cell DNA.  
 
Dr. Eric Holland  and members  of his laboratory  will conduct analyses of  baseline  tumor  
tissue for abnormalities of the RAS,  AKT,  and other signal  transduction  cascades that 
may predict tumor  sensitivity  to perifosine.   Dr. Holland  will also conduct  analyses  of 
tissue  resected  during  treatment  with perifosine (surgical  arm of the study)  to determine  
the effects  of perifosine on signaling.  
 
Jill M. Kolesar,  Pharm.  D. at the University  of Wisconsin  will conduct PK and tissue  
drug concentration  analyses.   AOI Pharmaceuticals  subcontracted  Dr. Kolesar  to perform  
such assays.  Please  see section  20.3 for instructions  on shipping  tissue/serum  to Dr. 
Kolesar.

 11.1 Toxicities/side  effects  
 
The most  common  toxicities  associate  with perifosine  are nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea.  
NCI CTC version 3.0 will be used  to grade all toxicity.  
 
Reported  Adverse  Events  and Potential  Risks:  
• Constitutional  Symptoms:  fatigue (lethargy,  malaise,  asthenia)  
• Gastrointestinal:  anorexia,  dehydration,  flatulence,  diarrhea,  nausea, vomiting  
 
The following  events were  reported  in two or fewer  of the patients  treated  on the  
NCI sponsored phase I  trial: 
• Pulmonary:  hiccoughs (hicc ups, singultus)  
• Renal/Genitourinary:  increased  creatinine  
• Hepatic:  increased  alkaline  phosphatase,  increased  GGT  
 
Also  reported  on the NCI phase I perifosine  trials and occurring  in two or fewer  
patients  with the relationship  to perifosine  still undetermined:  
• Blood/Bone  Marrow:  decreased  hemoglobin  
• Constitutional  Symptoms:  fever,  sweating,  weight  loss 
• Dermatology/Skin:  mild skin reaction  
• Gastrointestinal:  mucositis,  dyspepsia/heartburn  
• Neurology: lightheadedness  
• Ocular/Visual:  eye symptoms,  specif ically  blurred  vision, photophobia  and 
cataract  formation  
• Pain:  abdominal  pain,  headache,  arthritis,  arthralgia  
• Genitourinary:  hyperuricemia  
 
Also  from  animal  data:  
• Dose  dependent kidney  and eye events  (retinal  degeneration  and cataracts)  
 
If hematologic  toxicity  grade 3 or higher  occurs patients  may be treated  with appropriate  
growth  factors.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be progression  free survival  (PFS)  at six months  from  
registration.  For this and  for all other time  to event analyses,  if a patient  is NOT registered  
on the pre-operative  portion  of the study  (surgical  arm),  the start date for calculation  of 
time to event will be the date of  first study drug administration.  For this and for all other  
time to event analysis,  if a patient  IS enrolled  on the pre-operative  portion  of the study  
(surgical arm),  the start  date for calculation  of time to event will be the date of the first 
post-operative  study drug administration.

 Objective  status  should  be measured  and recorded  although  this is not the primary  
endpoint.  The following  definitions will  be used based on standard  criteria  for malignant  
glioma  trials [23]:  
 
Measurable Disease:  Bidimen sionally  measurable  lesions  with clearly  defined  
margins  by CT or MRI scan.  
 
Evaluable  Disease:  Unidimensionally  measurable  lesions,  masses  with margins  
not clearly  defined.  
 
Non-Evaluable  Disease: Not Applicable  for response  evaluation  
 
Objective  Status, To  Be Recorded at Each Evaluation: If there  are too many  
measurable  lesions  to measure  at each evaluation,  choose the  largest  two to be 
followed  before  a patient is entered  on study.  The remaining  lesions will be 
considered  evaluable  for the purpose  of objective  status determination.  Unless  
progression  is observed,  objective  status  can only be determined  when  ALL  
measurable  and evaluable  sites and lesions  are assessed.  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):   Complete  disappearance  of all measurable  and 
evaluable  disease.   No new lesions.  No evidence  of non-evaluable  disease.  All 
measurable,  evaluable  and non-evaluable  lesions and sites must  be assessed  using  
the same  techniques  as baseline.   Patients  must  be on no steroids.  
 
Partial  Response  (PR):  Greater  than or equal  to 50% decrease  under baseline in 
the sum  of products of  perpendicular diameters  of all measurable  lesions.  No 
progression  of evaluable  disease.  No new lesions.  All measurable and evaluable  
lesions  and sites must  be assessed using  the same  techniques  as baseline.  The 
steroid dose at the  time of the scan evaluation  should  be no greater than the 
maximum dose used in  the first 8 weeks  from  initiation  of therapy.  
 
Partial  Response, Non -Measurable (PRNM):  Not applicable.  
 
Stable/No  Response:  Does  not qualify  for CR, PR, or progression.   All 
measurable  and evaluable  sites must  be assessed  using the same  techniques as  
baseline.   The steroid  dose at the time of the scan evaluation  should be  no greater  
than the maximum dose used in the first  8 weeks from  initiation  of therapy.  
 
Progression: 25% increase  in the sum of products of  all measurable lesions  over 
smallest  sum observed (over baseline  if no decrease)  using  the same  techniques as  
baseline,  OR clear worsening  of any evaluable  disease,  OR appearance  of any 
new lesion/site,  OR clear clinical  worsening  or failure to return  for evaluation  due 
to death or deteriorating  condition  (unless  clearly  unrelated  to this cancer).

Unknown:  Progression  has not been  documented  and one or  more  measurable  or 
evaluable  sites have not  been assessed.  
 
Best Response:  This will be calculated  from  the sequence of  objective  statuses.  
 
For patients with  all disease  sites assessed  every  evaluation  period,  the best response will  
be defined  as the best objective  status.   If the response  does not persist at the next  regular  
scheduled  MRI,  the response  will still be recorded  based on  the prior  scan,  but will be 
designated  as a non-sustained  response.   If the response  is sustained,  e. g. still present on 
the subsequent  MRI,  it will  be recorded  as a sustained  response,  lasting  until the time of 
tumor  progression.  Best response  is unknown  if the patient  does not qualify  for a best  
response or increasing  disease  and if all objective status determinations  before  progression  
are unknown.  
 
Criteria  permitting  uni-dimensional  response measurement  have recently  been adopted  and 
published by an international  consensus  committee,  Response  Evaluation  Criteria In Solid  
Tumors  Group  (RECIST).   In order  to ensure comparability  of data from this trial with 
data from  earlier  trials,  this trial will retain  the traditional  evaluation  definition  above  as 
primary.  However,  RECIST criteria  that can be  collected,  will be used for secondary  
evaluation.  
 
Neurological  Exam:  Although  not used for determining  response, it  is useful  to evaluate  
improvement  in the neurologic  exam,  (as compared  to the baseline assessment),  that 
should coincide  with objective  measurement  of tumor  size.

Performance  Status:  Patients  will be graded according  to Karnofsky  Performance  Status  
(see Appendix   20.1).  
 
Time  to Treatment  Failure:  From  the treatment  start date to the date of  first observation  of 
progressive disease, non-reversible  neurologic  progression  or permanently  increased  
steroid  requirement  (applies  to stable disease only),  death due to any cause,  or early  
discontinuation  of treatment.  If a patient  is NOT registered  on the pre-operative  portion  of 
the study  (surgical  arm),  the start date for  calculation  of time to event will be the date of 
first study drug administration.  If a patient  IS enrolled  on the pre-operative  portion  of the 
study (surgical  arm),  the start date for calculation  of time to event will be the date of the

 first post-operative  study  drug administration.  As an exploratory  evaluation  of other means  
to demonstrate  clinical efficicacy,  the time to treatment  failure  in comparison  to time to the  
most  recent progression  for prior relapse  will also be calculated  for each patient; in this 
manner,  each patient  serves  as his/her  own control  and an increase  in the time to treatment  
failure relative  to the most  recent  progression  may also suggest  clinical  activity  of the drug.  
 
Time  to Death: From  the treatment  start date to date of death  due to any cause.  If a patient  
is NOT registered  on the pre-operative  portion  of the study (surgical  arm),  the start date for 
calculation  of time to event will be the date of  first study  drug administration.  If a patient  
IS enrolled  on the pre-operative  portion  of the study  (surgical  arm),  the start date for 
calculation  of time to event will be the date of  the first post-operative  study  drug 
administration.  
 
 
13.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL FROM  STUDY  
 
All patients may  continue therapy  unless  disease progression,  death, or dose limiting  
toxicity  is documented.  The cause of death should be recorded.  
 
The following  events may be considered  sufficient  reason for discontinuing  treatment  
with the study  medication  
 
• Serious  toxicity  due to the study drug graded according  to the NCI 
Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  v3.0 [22] 
• Conditions requiring  therapeutic  intervention  not permitted  by the protocol  
• Unacceptable  toxicity  in the opinion  of the patient  or investigator  even  if 
not specifically  defined  elsewhere  
• Personal  preference  by the patient  for any reason  
• Subject  non-compliance  with the defined  treatment  plan 
• Medical  or psychiatric  illness  or social  environment  which  in the 
investigator's  judgment  renders the patient  incapable  of further  therapy.  
• Any other situation  where,  in the opinion  of the investigator,  continued  
participation  in the study  would  not be in the best interest  of the patient  
• Treatment  delay due  to toxicity  greater  than 14 days 
• Pregnancy  
• Disease  progression  
 
All reasons  for discontinuation  of treatment  must  be documented  in the flow sheets.

 14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
The historical  values  for comparison  are from  a database of  225 GBM  patients  enrolled  in 
8 previous phase  II studies  (in which  none of  the treatments  were  considered  particularly  
effective.[24]  In this database,  the 6 month  PFS was 15% for GBM.   The 6 month  PFS 
for patients  treated  with BCNU for  recurrence/progression  was 17.5%.[3]  Therefore,  we 
would  expect  6 month  PFS to be less  than 20%.  
 
We will utilize  a Simon  two-stage  design  in which  the primary  endpoint  is the 
progression  rate at 6 months.   All patients  will be followed  for 6 months  and progression  
or death due to disease will  be considered  an event.   Assuming  a 6 month  progression  
free survival rate of  20% is considered  promising,  a 6 month  progression free survival  
rate of  5% is considered  not promising,  and the probabilities  of a type I error  (falsely  
accepting  a non-promising  therapy) and type II error (falsely  rejecting  a promising  
therapy)  are set at 0.10 and 0.10, respectively.    In the first stage  of this design,  12 
patients  with GBM  will be accrued.  If at least 1 patient  with GBM  does not progress  at 
the 6 month  time among  these 12 patients,  then an additional  25 patients  with GBM  (for a 
total of 37) will be accrued  to the  second  stage,  otherwise the  trial will be terminated.  
Note  that enrollment  of patients  with both GBM  and non-GBM  malignant  gliomas  will 
continue while the first 12 patients  with GBM  are followed  for PFS.  However,  if 0 of 
these first 12 reach 6mPFS,  then enrollment  will terminate; in that event,  any patients  still 
on trial with any histology  may continue until progression  or death at the discretion  of the 
treating  physician.  At the end of  the trial, if 3 or less patients with  GBM  are progression  
free at 6 months,  the study  will be declared  negative.   This design  yields at least a 0.90 
probability  of a positive  result  if the true response  rate is at least 20% and  yields  a 0.90 
probability  of a negative  result  if the true response  rate is 5%. 
 
Up to 20 patients  with anaplastic  glioma  and evaluable disease  at study  entry  (i.e., did not 
undergo gross  total resection  as the most  recent therapy prior  to registration)  will be 
accrued.  Endpoints  such as response,  one-year survival  probability,  overall  survival  and 
progression -free survival will  be computed  in order  to gain preliminary  data for these  
other malignant  glioma  subtypes.  However,  the historical  controls  for patients  with 
anaplastic  glioma  are less well defined  than for GBM;   therefore,  only patients  with GBM  
will be included  in analyses  of efficacy  and the  two-stage  design  will be applied only to 
the GBM  cohort.  
 
Surgical  arm 
In order  to obtain  specimens  for study  of the tissue  pharmacokinetics  of perifosine in 
tumors,  as well as the molecular  effects  of perifosine  in tumor  tissue, we plan to accrue  
subjects  to a preoperative  treatment  arm.  There  is no upper  bound on the number  of 
patients  that can be entered  into this substudy.   However,  if the study reaches  the total 
enrollment  and fewer  than 10 patients have entered  this substudy,  the trial will  be kept 
open to accrue  at least 10 surgical  arm patients.  Note,  the study  will only be kept open  if 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  06-044 A(11)  
Amended:   10/25/11

 the drug  is considered  promising  (defined  above) after  either the  first stage enrolling  12 
patients  with GBM  or complete  accrual  of the total cohort  of 37 patients  with GBM.  
Any additional  patients enrolled  through  this mechanism  will be included  in the primary  
analysis  of efficacy  (6mPFS)  and the total cohort  will be increased  from 37 patients with  
GBM  to a maximum  of 47 patients  with GBM  (37 + 10 additional  surgical patients  in the 
unlikely  circumstance  that none of  the initial  37 patients  are enrolled  on the surgical  
arm).   Therefore,  the maximum enrollment  is up  to 57 patients  (37 with GBM,  not on  
surgical  substudy;  up to 10 additional  patients  with anaplastic glioma;  up to 10 additional  
patients  on surgical  stubstudy  if not already  accrued).  
 
Although  patients  on the  surgical  substudy  will have  resections  of tumor  at the  initiation  
of treatment,  the natural history of  recurrent  GBM  strongly  supports  the concept  that 
nearly  all patients  will have tumor  progression by  6 months  if no further  treatment  or 
ineffective  treatment  is provided post-operatively.   For example,  a review of patients  with 
recurrent  GBM  treated  for first relapse  at the MD Anderson  Cancer  Center  also supports  
the concept  that gross  total resection  does not impact  on 6-month  PFS rate.  During  the 
time from  of 2001 -2003, 220 patients were  treated  at MD  Anderson  for first relapse  or 
progression  of GBM.   There was no difference  in 6-month  PFS between  those  patients  
who had a gross total resection  at relapse  compared  with all other  patients.   Hence,  we 
plan to combine  data from patients on and not on  the surgical substudy in  efficacy  
analyses.  
 
Molecular  and Metabolic  Correlates  
Pre-treatment  tissue  will be used for exploration  of molecular predictors  of tumor  
sensitivity  to perifosine (all  patients).   Tissue  resected  during  perifosine treatment  
(surgical arm)  will be used to explore  effects  of the agent  on PI3K/AKT  and RAS/MAPK  
signaling  as well as proliferation  and other pathways.  
 
FDG -PET and MR  Perfusion  studies  will be used for clinical care with the exception  of 
the FDG -PET performed  after 1-2 weeks  of therapy..   However,  they will also be used  for 
exploration  of perifosine effects  on tumor  metabolism  and blood flow.  To ensure  
adequate  comparability  of scans, all  FDG -PET scans must  be performed  at MSKCC.  
 
The analysis of biological  correlate  data has the overall  goal of providing increased  
understanding  of the nature  of the response  to perifosine.  The amount  of data available  
for the various  measures  is uncertain.  Information  may also be limited  by the impact  of 
intervening  treatment  between  the most  recent  surgery  and initiation  of perifosine.  The 
nature of  the analyses  and the strength  of the conclusions from these laboratory  studies  
depend not  only on the  amount  of data available,  but also on  the nature  of patient  
response  to therapy.   If the response  is not favorable , the data may  be used  to better  
understand  the reason for the failure.  In addition,  new assays  may become  available  
between  the opening of  this study and the collection  and analysis  of tumor  tissue.   Thus,

16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
A Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the  study.  The responsibilities of 
the RSA include project compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data 
reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  
the activities of the protocol  study  team.  
 
The data collected  for this study will be entered  into a secure database.  Source  
documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals and 
completeness  of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  
to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.   Accrual  rates and extext  and accuracy  
of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  
period and potential  problems  will be brought to  the attention  of the study  team  
for discussion  and action 
 
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits will  be conducted  by 
the study  team,  at a minimum  of two times  per year, more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.2  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  
Cancer  Center  were  approved  by the  National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  
The plans address  thenew policies  set forth  by the NCI in the document  entitled  
“Policy  of the National  Cancer Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of 
Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at 
MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical  Research.

 There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical trials  are monitored  for 
data, safety  and quality.  There  are institutional  processes in place  for quality  
assurance  (e.g.,  protocol monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  
therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  research  QA) and 
departmental  procedures for  quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  
committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities of our clinical  trials  
programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monito ring Committee  (DSMC) for 
Phase  I and  II clinical trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  
for Phase  III clinical trials,  report  to the Center’s Research  Council  and 
Institutional Review Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be 
assessed for its level  of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of 
protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored, in-house  sponsored,  industrial sponsored,  NCI 
cooperative group, etc.) will  be addressed  and the monit oring  procedures  will be 
established  at the  time of protocol activation.  
 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
17.1 Privacy  
It is the responsibility  of the Research  Staff to ensure that protocol  patients  have 
received  the Center’s  Notice  of Privacy  Practices.  If the subject  has not already  
done so, MSK personnel  must  try to obtain  acknowledgment  before  the patient  
participates in this  study.  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy Office  may allow  the use and  disclosure  of protected health  
information  pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  
The use and  disclosure  of protected health  information  will be limited  to the 
individuals described  in the Research  Authorization  form.   A Research

 17.2.1  Relationship  between  the adverse  event  and the study  
drug 
 
The Investigator  must  also assess  the relationship  of any adverse  event  to 
the use of  study  drug, based  on available  information,  using  the following  
guidelines:  
 
Unlikely  - no temporal  association,  or the cause  of the event has been  
identified,  or the drug  cannot  be implicated.  
Possibly  - temporal  association,  but other etiologies  are likely  to be the  
cause; however,  involvement  of the drug cannot  be excluded.  
Probably  - temporal  association,  other  etiologies are possible,  but unlikely.  
 
17.2.2  Definition  of Adverse  Event  
Adverse  events  are illnesses,  signs, or symptoms  that appear  or worsen  
during the course  of a study.   Adverse  events occurring  in association  with 
study drug administration,  whether  believed  by the investigator  to be  
related  or unrelated  to the drug should  be recorded  on the case report  form.  
When  the investigator is confident  of the diagnosis,  he should  group  
together  as a single  illness  all related  signs, symptoms,  and abnormal  
laboratory  results,  e.g. cough;  rhinitis,  and sneezing  can be reported as 
"upper respiratory  infection."  
 
Abnormal  laboratory  results  should  be noted on the case report  form  if 
they are associated  with an overdose,  require  or prolong inpatient  
hospitalization  or are otherwise  considered  significant  by the investigator.  
 
17.2.3  Definition  of Serious  Adverse  Event  
 
A serious adverse  event  is one that meets  any of  the following  criteria:  
• life-threatening  (all grade  4 events  except  myelosuppression,  nausea,  
emesis,  and hyperglycemia)  or fatal 
• substantial  or permanent  disability  
• requires  or prolongs  inpatient  hospitalization  (this does not include  
hospitalization  for elective  treatment  or emergency  room  visits)  
• cancer  (2 malignancy)  
• a congenital anomaly  in the offspring  of a patient  who received  trial 
medicat ion 
• an event  resulting  from  an overdose  (overdoses without  clinical  
sequelae  are not serious adverse  events)  
• an event  (not mentioned  in a-f) that may jeopardize  the patient  or may 
require  intervention  to prevent  one of  the outcomes  listed  above.

18.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  
 
All patients must  provide  written  informed  consent prior  to registration  and 
treatment.  Those  physicians  authorized  to obtain  informed  consent are listed  on the title 
page of  this document.  
 
18.2 Research Authorization:   Procedures  for obtaining  Research  Authorization:  
Before  any protocol -specific  procedures  are carried  out, investigators and/or  designated  
staff will  fully explain  the details  of the protocol,  study procedures,  and the aspects  of 
patient privacy  concerning  research  specific information.  In addition  to signing  the IRB 
Informed  Consent, all patients  must  sign the Research  Authorization  component  of the 
informed  consent form.   The Research  Authorization  requires a separate  set of signatures  
from  the patient.  The original  signed  documents  will become  part of  the patient’s  medical

 20.4 Handling  and Shipping  of Serum  and Tissue  for Perifosine  Measurement:  
 
A. Serum  
At each time point, heparinized  blood  is collected  into a plastic vacutainer to  minimize  
adhesion of  perifosine.  Plasma  is separated  by centrifugation  and stored  in 
polypropylene  cryovials at -70°C  until assayed.  Perifosine in plasma  is measured  by a 
validated  reversed  phase  liquid  chromatography/electrospray  mass  spectrometry  method  
by Jill  M. Kolesar,  Pharm.D at the University  of Wisconsin,  Comprehensive  Cancer  
Center  who has been subcontracted  by AOI Pharmaceuticals to perform  these analyses.  
An LC/MS  analytical  method  used in NCI sponsored phase  I trials (Woo  EW, Messmann  
R, Sausville EA,  Figg WD.  Quantitative  determination  of perifosine,  a novel  
alkylphosphocholine anticancer  agent,  in human  plasma  by reversed -phase  liquid  
chromatography -electrospray  mass  spectrometry.  J Chromatogr  B Biomed  Sci Appl.  
2001 Aug 15;759(2):247 -57), is currently  available  for plasma  samples  at the Univ.  of 
Wisconsin,  and will be used for this study.  The pharmacokinetic characteristics  of 
perifosine in patients  will be evaluated  using WinNonlin  modeling  software.  
 
Sample  processing  and handling  outline:  
 
1) A pharmacokinetic  sample  will be obtained  from  each patient,  at the times  outlined.  
One sodium  heparin 10cc green  top with >7ml  of blood will be obtained  and shipped  to 
the Jill M. Kolesar,  Pharm.D at the University  of Wisconsin  for further  analysis.  
 
2) Pharmacokinetic  samples  will be obtained  in association  with perifosine administration  
at pretreatment,  and weekly  during weeks  2-4. 
 
3) Peripheral  blood is  to be drawn  into heparinized  vacutainer (green  top) provided  in the 
sample  collection  kit.  The Patient’s initials,  time sample  obtained, date sample  was 
obtained  should  be recorded  on each  green top  tube.  
 
4) Within  20 minutes  of collection,  centrifuge  the blood samples  at 900g for 15 minutes  
(or use  the local  laboratory  Standard  Operating  Procedure)  to separate  plasma.  
 
5) For each sample  collected,  pipet  duplicate  aliquots  of plasma,  2 ml each, in  
polypropylene  cryovials (Nunc)  provided  in the sample  collection  kit.  Aliquot  1 is the 
sample  and aliquot  2 is the duplicate.  
 
6) Place the appropriate labels,  included  in the  sample  collection  kit, onto the tubes  and 
freeze  at -70°C until shipped.  
 
7) Sample  Shipping:  
• Samples  are to be shipped  overnight  in sufficient dry ice  to keep  samples  
frozen  using  the airbill  and shipping  box provided  in the kit.

 20.4. Supportive  Care Guidelines for Controlling  Side Effects  Associated with the  
Administration of Perifosine  
 
 
REMINDERS  
Patients  should  take all medication  with food,  and not on an  empty  stomach.  
Pills should  remain  intact  and should  not be crushed  except  to administer via g-tube.  
 
NAUSEA  AND  VOMITING  
Loading  dose schedule  
• Patients  should  divide  the loading  dose of perifosine  into 150mg  every  6 hours  until the 
total loading  dose is administered.  Please  note that administering  the total dose could  
take longer  than 24 hours,  but it must  be taken  within  a 48-hour period.  
• 5HT3  antagonist —such as, but not limited  to, ondansetron  and granisetron —can be 
administered  every  12 hours  on the day of therapy  and every  12 hours  for 24 hours  after  
the day of  therapy.  
• Dexamethasone  4mg po in conjunction  with the 5HT3  antagonist  unless  otherwise  
contraindicated . 
If the above  steps are ineffective,  the frequency  of the 5HT3  antagonist  can be increased.  
• Metoclopramide  5mg Q.I.D.  can be  added if  needed.  
• If the nausea  could be related  to anticipation,  the use of  lorazepam  can be initiated.  
• Patients  should  have  some  medication  on hand  for breakthrough  nausea —such as 
promethazine  or prochlorperazine.  
If nausea  and/or  vomiting  remains  uncontrollable  after following  the recommendations  listed  
above,  the perifosine  dose can be reduced  as detailed  in the Dose  Modifications  section  of the 
relevant  perifosine  protocol(s).  
 
Daily  dosing  schedule  
• Patients  should  take medication  at bedtime  – with food and not on an empty  stomach.  
• Although  the use of prophylactic  antiemetics  should  not be necessary  for patients  on 
daily  dosing,  they should  have  antiemetics  on hand —such as promethazine  or 
prochlorperazine —if they do encounter  nausea  and/or  vomiting.  If these  antiemetics  
are not effective,  the treating  physician  may escalate  the antiemetics  to the ones listed  
above for the loading dose.  
If nausea  and/or  vomiting  continue  after following  the recommendations  above,  dose 
reductions  can be initiated  in accordance  to the Dose  Modifications  section  of the relevant  
perifosine  protocol(s).

DIARRHEA  
For both Loading  and Daily  Dose  Schedules  
At the first sign of change in stool  or bowel  function  initiate  recommendations  
• Imodium  4mg at the first onset of  diarrhea.  
• Repeat  Imodium  2mg every 2 hours  until diarrhea  subsides  for 12 hours.  
• Patients  can take Imodium  4mg every  4 hours  during  the night  to minimize  interruption  
of sleep.  
• Drink  plenty  of fluids.  
• Avoid  foods  and liquids  that can aggravate  diarrhea —such as dairy  products,  seeds,  
nuts, etc.. 
• The treating  physician  may use other antidiarrhea medications at his/her  discretion.  
For diarrhea that cannot be controlled  by following  these recommendations,  refer to the Dose  
Modification  section  of the relevant perifosine  protocol(s).  
 
 
GOUT  AND/OR HYPERURICEMIA  
For both Loading  and Daily  Dose  Schedules  
• All patients should be asked  about the possible  prior  history  of gout or hyperuricemia.  
• Patients  with prior  history  of gout or elevated  uric acid levels  should  receive  allopurinol  
300mg  by mouth  daily  for prophylaxis.  
• The treating  physician  may increase  the dose of allopurinol  or change  medications  at 
his/her  discretion  as warranted  by the individual patient’s status.  
 
 
NOTE  ABOUT  THIS INFORMATION  
• Treating  physicians  may use other  agents  at their discretion.  
• These  recommendations  are based  on current  information  obtained  from  clinical  
studies —that have  either  been  completed  or are underway —examining  the efficacy  and 
safety  of perifosine.

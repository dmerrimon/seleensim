TRIAL  TITLE   
ARTISAN: iCAST™ RX De Novo Stent Placement for the 
Treatment of Atherosclerotic Renal Art ery Stenosis in Patients 
with Resistant Hypertension  
OBJECTIVE   
The primary objective of the ARTISAN  trial is to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of the iCAST™ RX Stent System  for the 
treatment of subject s with resistant hypertension associated with 
de novo atherosclerotic renal artery disease .  
PRIMARY ENDPOINTS   
Functional Endpoint : Assessment of primary patency rat e at 9-
months , defined as continuous patency without the occurrence of 
a total occlusion of the original lesion,  without a  re-intervention 
to treat a partial or total occlusion of the stented segment , or 
bypass of the stented segment due to clinically -driven restenosis 
or occlusion.  
 
Clinical  Endpoint : Improvement in systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) at 9 -months as compared to baseline systolic blood 
pressure.  
SECONDARY 
ENDPOINTS   
1. The occurrence of procedure -related Major Adverse Event s 
(MAE)  reported as p ercentage of subjects with MAE , at 30-
days, 9 -months, 12-months, 24-months, and 36 -months. 
Inclusive of:  
a. Procedure - or device -related occurren ce of death

(including post -dilatation) assessed via quantitative vascular 
analysis (QVA) by an independent core laboratory .  
 
3. Procedural success defined as technical success without the 
occurrence of MAE prior to ho spital discharge.  
 
4. TLR measured as the proportion of subjects that require a 
clinically -driven  reintervention of the target lesion through 9 -
months.  
a. A clinically -driven TLR is defined as a TLR 
(percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA), bare 
metal stent or r epeat covered stent deployment, or 
surgical bypass) due to documented recurrent

5. Rate of incidental TLR defined as rate of TLRs not meeting 
the definition of a clinically driven TLR.  
 
6. Improved SBP control assessed at 30 -days, 9-months, 12 -
months, 24 -months, and 36 -months .  
 
7. Secondary patency rate a t 9-months after a clinically -driven 
TLR  which restores patency after total occlusion . 
 
8. Change in number and dosage of anti-hypertensive 
medications as compared to baseline.  
 
9. Renal function compared to baseline as measured by 
estimated glomerular filtratio n rate ( eGFR ) at 30-days and 9-
months.  
TRIAL DESIGN   
This is a prospective, single -arm, multicenter clinical trial that 
will take place at up to  25 US/OUS sites. Primary endpoints 
have been determined to show the safety , effectiveness, and 
clinical outcom es of the iCAST™ RX Stent System . Safety and 
effectiveness will be evaluated based on  the primary patency rate 
at 9-months on a per lesion basis evaluated against a 
performance goal of published  studies wit h bare-metal stents. 
The primary clinical endpoint  will assess the improvement in 
SBP at 9-months as compared to baseline SBP.

Eligible subjects will undergo a two -week Medical 
Documentation Screening period  to confirm resistant 
hypertension (SBP ≥ 155mmHg) while on maximum tolerable 
doses of ≥ three an ti-hypertensive medications from at least  
three classes of drugs , one of which must be a diuretic .  
 
There must be documented clinical evidence to support 
likelihood of angiographic findings > 80% whether it is Duplex 
Ultrasound  (DUS ), Computed Tomography angiogram ( CTa), 
Magnetic Resonance angiogram (MRa ) or other medical 
evidence . After meeting screening and clinical eligibility criteria, 
subjects will undergo a baseline assessment for angiographic 
eligibility. After angiographic documentation of a ≥ 80% 
diameter renal artery stenosis or Fraction Flow Reserve (FFR) < 
0.8 is confirmed , the subject may be enrolled in the trial by 
placement of  the investigational  device.  
 
The 9 -month visit will include a follow -up DUS of the target 
renal artery. If the  DUS is non -diagnostic due to an imaging 
quality problem, such as overlying bowel gas or body habitus, a 
second DUS may be attempted . If the DUS  is indicative of ≥ 
60% stenosis as determined by the core laboratory , or the second 
DUS remains non -diagnostic, a contrast angiogram will be used 
to assess the degree of restenosis of the covered stent(s).   
 
Clinical follow -up visits will be required for all enrolled subje cts 
at 30 -days, 9 -month s, 12-months, 24 -months, and 36 -months.   A 
6-month and 18 -month visit will occur via telephone to collect 
medication usage and Adverse Events  (AEs)  only.  The 36 -
month  clinic office visit will be required as the final safety visit.

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 1.0 BACKGROUND  
 
Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis 
(RAS) in the adult population .(1) ARAS may result in progressive renal impairment, renovascular 
hypertension, and/or cardiac disturbance syndromes. As the disease progresses, the result ing 
luminal narrowing decreases blood flow to the kidney, which, in turn, is often accompanied by a 
reduction in kidney function as well as hypertension triggered by activation of the renin -
angiotensin axis. If left untreated, ARAS may progress to renal fa ilure.(2) 
 
The identification and management of patients with suboptimal control of hypertension and 
coexistent atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is both challenging and controversial .(3, 4) Current 
ACC/AHA Peripheral Arterial Disease Guidelines identify renal artery stent deployment as a 
revascularization strategy in patients with hypertension resistant to optimal medical 
management .(5) However, a contemporary literature review suggested that there is no data 
supporting a revascularization strategy over optimal antihypertensive medical therapy .(6) Indeed, 
several single -arm prosp ective trials sponsored by commercial device manufacturers, while 
establishing the procedural safety of renal artery stent deployment after failed/suboptimal 
balloon angioplasty, were unable to demonstrate a predictable and durable reduction in blood 
press ure.(7, 8) 
 
More than 50% of subjects with uncontrolled hypertension unresponsive to traditional medical 
therapy  may have significant ARAS and are considered candidat es for surgical revascularization 
or percutaneous intervention for the resolution or stabilization of hypertension and renal 
dysfunction. Surgical revascularization has proven to be an effective treatment with acceptable 
long-term patency rates but is hamp ered by significant morbidity and mortality.(2) Percutaneous 
transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) has been successful in reducing morbidity and mortality 
compared to surgical revascularization but has poor technical success du e to high rates of elastic 
recoil and dissection for typical ostial lesions, as well as high restenosis rates.  Primary stenting 
of atherosclerotic ostial lesions in the renal artery has thus become the preferred method of 
treatment due to higher success r ates compared to surgical revascularization .(2) 
 
To date, there have been no pivotal clinical trials of blood pressure control or of safety , for newer 
generation stents in patients with resistant hypertension as sociated with ARAS . Previously 
published industry -sponsored trials have not focused on improvement of hypertension control as 
a primary endpoint .(9) The Cardiovascular Outcomes of Renal Artery Lesions (CORAL) tr ial(10), 
a National Institutes of Health  (NIH) sponsored, prospective randomized controlled trial of 
optimal medical therapy compared to optimal medical therapy and renal artery stent deployment, 
will define t he potential impact of renal artery stenting on rates of cardiovascular related  
morbidity  and mortality , progression to renal replacement therapy and blood pressure control 
over five years of follow -up. However, the final analysis of this 1,050 cohort tria l is not 
anticipated until after 201 1. In the interim, clinical trials designed to establish the safety of new

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 renal stent designs and their effectiveness in improving blood pressure control are needed. In 
order to facilitate the initiation and completion of single -armed prospective trials investigating 
the safety and effectiveness of balloon -expandable stents to treat hypertensive patients with 
ARAS , physicians (VIVA) have used modern clinically relevant data and statistical modeling to 
develop blood press ure and procedural safety performance goals to be used as a comparator in 
some single -armed prospective trials .(2) 
 
Although a trend toward a favorable restenosis rate has been noted with the use of stents,  
as compared with the with balloon angioplasty alone ,(11, 6) restenosis remains the  main concern 
after PTRA  stenting . Restenosis often results in symptom recurrence and may  progress to 
occlusion and kidney loss.  Thus, e arly restenosis detection is important to allow  for effective 
secondary intervention ; DUS is emerging as a screening modality for RAS .(12,13, 14) Although the 
value of DUS in RAS screening is well established, its role in  assessing the hemodynamic 
outcome of percutaneous intervention and routine follow -up after successful intervention has not 
been well evaluated .(15) 
 
A number of recognized conditions can limit the accuracy of intrarenal DUS in R AS evaluation, 
such as multiple (more than two) renal arteries or only mild to m oderate stenosis .(13) Patients who 
are young or have highly  compliant arteries may have an absent  early systol ic peak, especially 
when distal interlo bar arteries are sampled, which may yield false -positive results .(16) Conversely,  
noncompliant vess els may not display the parvus -tardus response and  may result in fa lse-
negative results .(17) Several ext raneous factors may also affect the accuracy of intrarenal DUS 
including valvular heart disease, left ventricular contracti lity disorders, and the effect of 
vasoactive drug s.(15) 
 
Clinical follow -up, which  has traditionally been used in large series  of percutaneous and surgical 
renal artery  revascularizations, may not enable detection  of asymptomat ic restenosis before it  
becomes symptomatic or progresses to  kidney loss. Magnetic resonance angiography  (MRa)  
after stent placement is limited by  the ferromagnetic artifacts caused by  most stents .(18) DUS as a 
follow -up modali ty offers  several advantages: being widely available, non -invasive, relatively 
inexpensive, and well tolerated by patients  as it does not require iodinated contrast media . DUS 
in the evaluation of initial patency an d subsequent surveillance after renal art ery 
revascularization has been recommended .(19, 20, 21)  
 
Renal artery angioplasty and stent placement are generally well -tolerated procedures. As 
comp ared to stand -alone balloon angioplasty, renal artery stenting is associated with improved 
immediate results and a decrease in the rate of restenosis.(22) Complications include contrast -
induced nephropathy, th rombosis, distal embolization, renal artery dissection , and perforation.(17) 
Distal protection devices are attractive for safeguarding against the effects of distal embolization 
and are currently under investigation .(6) However, the short length of renal arteries and lack of a 
safe landing zone for placement of distal protection devices is a limiting factor. An alternative

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 strategy could be the use of covered stents.  
 
The use of polyt etraflouroethylene  (PTFE ) covered stents is designed to combine the 
effectiveness of surgical treatment with the minimal invasiveness of endovascular treatment .(23) 
The stent -associated PTFE derived graft layer creates a mechan ical barrier between the arterial 
lumen and wall, theoretically improving patency .(24) This method prevents exposure of the vessel 
wall to constituents of blood that may initiate the intimal hyperplastic process which may reduc e 
the incidence of in -stent restenosis .(24) Lakshminarayan et al suggests that because covered stents 
could potentially exclude thrombus from within the lumen of lesions with large thrombus 
burden, there may be a role for these  stents in reducing distal embolization.  
 
1.1 INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
The iCAST ™ RX Stent System consists of a balloon -expandable covered stent and a balloon 
dilation catheter. The stent is constructed out of 316L surgical stainless steel. The one piece stent 
cover is constructed out of a tubular form of expanded polytetraflouroethylene  (ePTFE).  The 
covering is attached in a manner such that both the inner lumen and outer surface of the stent are 
encapsulated with the ePTFE cover material. The stent is radio -opaque under fluoroscopy. The 
covered stent is mounted and crimped on to the dual lumen rapid exchange balloon catheter 
(delivery system) so that the system is ready for use by the clinician.   
 
The balloon catheter shaft is comprised of two main sections: a distal coaxial section comprised 
of a thermoplastic inner tube and thermoplastic outer tube and a proximal section comprised of a 
304 stainless steel hypo  tube assembly. The proximal end of the coaxial section is attached to the 
distal end of the hypo  tube. A non -compliant thermoplastic dilatation balloon is attached  onto the 
distal aspect of the coaxial catheter section. Radiopaque markers are affixed to the inner tube of 
the distal catheter section to identify the dilatation zone of the balloon. The dista l catheter  tip is  
tapered to facilitate advancement of the catheter to and through the stenosis. The proximal hypo 
tube assembly section of the catheter is comprised of a stainless steel hypo  tube with an 
overmolded locking female  Luer hub attached to one end to allow attachment of a male locking 
Luer fitting (syringe/inflation device) . The attached female Luer hub is molded out of clear 
plastic to assist the user with purging the device of air during preparation. A strain relief is 
affixed over the Luer hu b and is printed with the device information (stent length, deployed stent 
diameter, guide wire size, and company logo).   
 
The catheter main lumen (annular space between the inner and outer coaxial tubes and lumen of 
hypo tube assembly) is used for inflati on and deflation of the attached balloon . The secondary 
lumen  (lumen of the inner tube of coaxial assembly) , is referred to as the Rapid Exchange ( RX) 
lumen  and is used for guide wire introduction. The inner and outer tubes are joined 
approximately 25cm fr om the distal tip to form the guide wire access port . The catheter will be 
available in two working lengths: 80cm and 140cm . Balloons will be available in diameters of 5, 
6, and 7mm and in lengths to accommodate the length of each stent. Table 1: iCAST ™ RX Stent

1.2 INDICATION FOR USE  
The iCAST™ RX Stent System  (iCAST RX) is indicated for the improvement in blood pressure 
control for use as an adjunct to balloon angioplasty of de novo or restenotic  lesion s (≤ 16 mm in 
length)  of the rena l artery, with a referenc e vessel diameter of 5.0 mm to 7.0 mm to assist in the 
maintenance of vessel patency .  
  
Refer to the manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) for instructions including: sizing and 
selection of the stent, preparation of the stent a nd delivery catheter, introduction and positioning 
of the stent, deployment of the stent, removal of an unexpanded stent, and emergency withdrawal 
of an expanded stent.  
 
2.0 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
2.1 RATIONALE  
The primary goal of revascularization therapy is the re -establishment and maintenance of 
adequate blood flow with in the renal artery to perfuse the kidney.  ARTISAN  will investigate the 
re-establishment of adequate blood flow  and normalized pressure in the renal artery and it s effect 
on blood pressure in patients  with resistant hypertension. In this single -arm trial,  primar y 
endpoints have been determined  to show the safety , effectiveness, and clinical outcomes  of the 
iCAST™ RX Stent System . Safety and effectiveness will be evaluated based on  the primary 
patency r ate at 9 -months on a per lesion basis evaluated against a performance goal of published  
studies with bare -metal stents. The primary clinical endpoint will assess the improvement in SBP 
at 9-months as compared to baseline SBP.  
 
The primary functional endpo int of primary patency has been established since the clinical care 
of the physician is considered a more objective measurement of stent performance than the 
restenosis measurement of DUS alone.  In standard practice, a DUS is used to determine patency 
of a stent.  If a DUS is negative and the patient is asymptomatic, no intervention  is typically 
conducted by a physician.  If a patient is symptomatic or a DUS is positive , a confirmatory 
angiogram is typically performed to assess the patency of the vessel.  
 
To properly match the functional outcomes with historical data , the endpoint will be calculated  
on a per lesion basis . This reflects the current standard of care of treating patients with single

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 vessel renal artery lesions and those patients with bilatera l renal artery stenosis. A nalysis of past 
studies  has demonstrated that the number of lesions treated per patient has increased with 
time.(26) A recent  renal  trial report ed 1.2 lesions per patient  were treated .(27) To calculate on a per 
patient level for this endpoint would bias the results  and overestimate the failure rate  compared 
to a per lesion analysis,  as more lesions would be at risk for restenosis but would not be 
accounted for i n a per patie nt analysis . 
 
DUS  is an established safe, noninvasive, reproducible, and sensitive method of detecting and 
following renal artery lesions that provides both morphological and functional assessments of the 
renal arteries .(22, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32) There are limits  with relying exclusively on DUS for evaluating 
residual stenosis post -renal stenting. Velocity information such as peak systolic velocity ( PSV) 
and renal aortic ratio ( RAR ) correlate with angiographic stenosis but these DUS criteria , 
developed for native renal arteries within renal artery stents has not been studied extensively .(25) 
The extremes of ARAS can lead to a variety of waveform and flow velocity abnormalities and 
the entire main renal art ery must be visualized in order to perform an adequate examination .(24) 
There are documented technical disadvantages to DUS as it is very operator dependent and as 
such, is associated with higher technical fai lure rate than other diagnostic modalities, in part due 
to the steep learning curve associated with the technique. To mitigate the challenges with DUS 
interpretation, clinical validation through independent noninvasive core laboratory  and/or 
angiography wi ll be require d in order to correctly validate and definitively assess residual 
percent diameter stenosis.  DUS is highly reliable in identifying widely paten t stents. However, 
correlation studies of DUS with angiography have confirmed that DUS is not as acc urate when 
results suggest a stenosis. To mitigate the risk of inaccurate readings, if a stenosis is detected, an 
alternate means of clinical validation will be used to definitively assess patency.  
 
The primary clinical endpoint of reduction in SBP has bee n established to determine the benefit 
of revascularization therapy to perfuse the kidney.  The Framingham Heart Study showed that 
decreasing SBP by 10mmHg can be lifesaving. Additionally,  Joint National Committee VII (JNC 
VII) estimates that a 5mmHg reduc tion in SBP would reduce the incidence of stroke in patients 
by 14%, coronary heart disease ( CHD ) by 9%, and overall mortality by 7% .(33) JNC VII also 
presented data from a UK diabetes study that demonstrated a 10mmHg decrease in SBP was 
associated with average reductions of 15% for diabetes -related mortality, 11% for MI, and 13% 
for microvascular complications of retinopathy or nephropathy.(33) Currently accepted indications 
for revascularization are significant ARAS with progressive or acute deterioration of renal 
function and/or severe uncontrolled hypertension; the key point for success is the correct 
selection of the patient .(34) When performed correctly, renal artery stenting had been shown to 
stabilize o r improve renal function and/or renovascular hypertension in 65 -70% of carefully 
selected patients with ARAS .(1) It is under this guidance that patients with  uncontrolled 
hypertension will be selected by specific angiographic and clinical selection criteria  for this trial.  
 
While previous clinical s tudies have not consistently shown a direct beneficial effect on

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 hyperten sion or renal function, revascularization therapy potentially eliminates one of the several 
factors that contribute to hypertension. This may be supported by the fact that some patients do 
show a stabilization or improvement in their hypertension following  revascularization. Clinical 
data show that successful renal artery stenting permits reintroduction of ACE inhibitors in some 
patients which in turn leads to satisfactory maintenance of renal function.(35) Current clinical  
experience does not allow one to predict exactly which patients may experience a clinical benefit 
from renal artery stenting . It is hypothesized that revascularization therapy for hemodynamically 
significant lesions may facilitate the stabili zation or reduction of blood pressure in conjunction 
with ongoing medical therapy for some portion of patients whose blood pressure is otherwise 
refractory to medical treatment.  
 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria in the ARTISAN trial seeks to target subject s likely to respond 
positively based on findings observed in the VIVA performance goals for blood pressure 
treatment.  In the VIVA paper, p atients are selected specifically for blood pressure improvement 
based on the review of three prior studies that sugg est patients with resistant hypertension  with a 
systolic blood pressure > 155mmHg, have been medically optimized with 3 or more hypertensive 
medications, and a lesion that is hemodynamically significant (or gradient) will have a likelihood 
of having a bloo d pressure improvement beyond medical therapy alone .(36) 
 
The ARTISAN  trial will assess  the impact of  additional clinical outcomes in this patient 
population such as improvements in systolic blood pressure and  renal function as determined by 
eGFR. Additionally, MAEs, the number and dose of antihypertensive medications used, 
technical success, acute procedural success, 30 -day clinical success, and TLR will be assessed as 
part of the secondary endpoint analysis. The American Heart Association scientific statement, 
Guidelines for the  Management of Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease 2006 , in 
combination with discussions with expert physicians and data provided from review of previous 
clinical trials of renal artery stents, were used to select the primary and secondary endpoints as 
applicable measures of device effectiveness and safet y.(37) 
 
Renal artery stent placement has gained increasing acceptance on the basis  of historical results of 
renal angioplasty and the attractiveness of percutaneous compared with surgical 
revascularization.(38) As a result, primary stenting of lesions has become the standard of care.  In 
this study, primary stenting of the target lesion  will be performed  where possible . The enrollment 
criterion  of the ARTISAN  trial has selected patients with hemodynamically significant stenoses 
and where necessary, pre-dilatation will be performed due to  narrowing of the  lumen diameter of 
the stenosis compared to the size of the device being inserted.  This strategy is selected to 
minimize the risk of distal embolization  and stent dislodgment during deployment . 
 
In conclusion, the safety , effectiveness , and c linical benefit of reducing blood pressure with the 
iCAST™ RX Stent System will be evaluated under the ARTISAN trial design .

3.0 TRIAL DESIGN AND POP ULATION  
 
This is a prospective, single -arm, multicenter clinical trial that will take place at up to  25 
US/OUS sites. Primary endpoints have been determined to show the safety , effectiveness, and 
clinical outcom es of the iCAST™ RX Stent System . Safety and effectiveness will be evaluated 
based on  the primary patency rate at 9-months on a per lesion basis evaluated against a 
performance goal of published  studies wit h bare-metal stents. The primary clinical endpoint  will 
assess the improvement in systolic blood pressure at 9-months as compared to baseline systolic 
blood pressure.  
 
Eligible  subjects will undergo a two -week Medical Documentation Screening period to confirm 
resistant hypertension (SBP ≥ 155mmHg) while on maximum tolerable dose of  ≥  three anti -
hypertensive medications from at least three classes of drugs , one of which must be a  diuretic .  
 
There must be documented clinical evidence to support likelihood of angiographic findings > 
80% whether it is DUS, CTa, MRa or other medical evidence . After meeting screening and 
clinical eligibility criteria, subjects will undergo a baseline assessment for angiographic 
eligibility. After angiographic  documentation of a ≥ 80% diameter renal artery stenosis  or FFR < 
0.8 is confirmed  the subject may be enrolled in the trial by placement of the investigational  
device.  
 
The 9 -month visit will include a follow -up DUS of the target renal artery. If the  DUS is non -
diagnostic due to an imaging problem, such as overlying bowel gas or body habitus, a second 
DUS may be attempted . If the DUS is indicative of ≥ 60% stenosis as determined by the core 
laboratory , or the second DUS remains non -diagnostic, a contrast a ngiogram will be used to 
assess the degree of restenosis of the covered stent(s).   
 
Clinical follow -up visits will be required for all enrolled subjects at 30-days, 9-months , 12-
months, 24 -months and 36 -months .  A 6 -month and 18 -month visit will occur via telephone to

A trial research staff member will explain the purpose, procedures, device , and int ent of the trial 
to each potential participant. Interested subjects will be invited to join the trial and asked to 
provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any trial related procedure.  
 
A focused hypertension medical history will be reviewe d and recorded for each subject. History 
should capture at least three months’ information prior to screening to document that reasonable 
and aggressive efforts were previously made to manage hypertension via a broad variety of 
medications that have been t ried and failed. Potential subjects will have been on a stable 
medication regimen for a minimum of two weeks prior to beginning the Medical Documentation 
Screening period. A minimum of a 14-day Medical Documentation Screening period is required 
to refine c ase selection and identify subject s most likely to benefit from renal revascularization *. 
Titration of the subject ’s antihypertensive medications will not be allowed during this period.  
The Medical Documentation Screening period will proceed in the followi ng sequence:  
 
1. Potential subjects will complete an initial office visit d uring which 3 blood pressure 
measurements will be obtained, utilizing a standardized technique  (APPENDIX 3: 
METHODOLOGY FOR OFFICE -BASED B P MEASUREMENT ), to determine an 
average  SBP value.  If the average initial SBP value  for this visit  is ≥ 1 50mmHg, then the 
subject will proceed to step 2.  
 
2. The subject  will be tested for proteinuria , have labs drawn , can be scheduled for the 
procedure,  and will proceed to step 3.

pressure measurements will be taken  again , utilizing a standardized technique  
(APPENDIX 3: METHODOLOGY FOR OFFICE -BASED B P MEASUREMENT ), to 
determine a n average SBP value.  Only subjects with a n average SBP of ≥  155mmHg 
from the three measurements taken on the last day of the 14 -day Medical Documentation 
Screening period will be considered for enrollment.  
 
*NOTE: If a subject is seen in the clinic  with a medical history documenting  at least a 1 month 
stable medication of ≥  three  anti-hypertensive medication s from at least three classes of drugs,  
one of which being a diuretic and documented SBP  ≥ 155mmHg , they will be allowed t o skip the 
formal Medical Documentation Screening period and to be enrolled as so on as the history and 
baseline labs are  reviewed by the Medical Monit or. Subjects must complete the daily 
questionnaire from the day of consent through the day of procedure.  All other protocol 
requirements that would have normally occurred during the two w eek screening period must still 
be completed even if the screening period is skipped. These assessments includ e: vitals, BP , 
Labs, test for proteinuria, physical exam, and a pregnancy test and would need to be completed 
either on the day of consent or prior to the day of procedure.

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 3.5 SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Up to 138 subjects will be enrolled in this clinical trial. Eligible subjects will be enrolled 
consecuti vely at each investigational  site. A patient is deemed enrolled into the trial once all 
inclusion criteria have been met and reviewed by an independent medical monitor, no exclusion 
criteria exist, the operator determines the target lesion is ≥ 80% diameter stenosis or FFR < 0.8 
and the trial device enters the subject .  The screening log will then be completed to document the 
enrollment, subject number, or reason for non -enrollment of subjects screened but not enrolled in 
the ARTISAN  trial. 
3.6 SUB JECT DISCONTINUATION  
Each enrolled subject shall remain in the trial until completion of the required follow -up period, 
however, a subject’s participation in any clinical trial is voluntary and the subject has the right to 
withdraw at any time without pena lty or loss of standard of care treatment . Conceivable reasons 
for discontinuation may include, but not be limited to, the following:  
1. Subject death  
2. Subject voluntary withdrawal  
3. Subject withdrawal by physician as clinically indicated  
 
The reason for subjec t discontinuation must be documented on the  electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF ) and source documents. Investigators must also report all subject discontinuations to their 
IRB/EC as defined by their Institution’s procedure.  
3.7 SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL  
All subjects should be encouraged to remain in the trial throughout the entire follow up time 
period .  If a subject decides to discontinue trial participation, the reason for their discontinuation 
must be recorded in the medical record and submitted via the eCRF. Subje cts who discontinue 
participation prematurely will be included in the analysis results  if the 9-month visit has been 
reached.   
3.8 EARLY TERMINATION OF THE TRIAL  
Possible reasons for early trial termination include:  
1. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  present an unreasonable risk to subjects.  
2. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  makes a decision for the early termination of 
the trial per recommendation (refer to Section  7.1). 
 
If the trial is terminated early, Atrium  will provide a written statement to the Investigator to 
enable notification to their IRB /EC.

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 5.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
5.1 ASSUMPTION OF PRIMAR Y ENDPOINT RATE  
The endpoints will be tested in a sequential manner:  
 
1) Functional Endpoint  
Assessment of  primary patency rate  at 9-months , defined as continuous patency without 
the occurrence of a total occlusion of the original lesion, without a re-intervention to treat 
a partial or total occlusion of the stented  segment, or bypass of the stented segment du e to 
clinically -driven restenosis or occlusion.  
 
Followed by:  
 
2) Clinical  Endpoint  
Improvement in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 9-months as compared to baseline 
systolic blood pressure.  
 
If the null hypothesis for the functional goal is rejected at the 0. 025 level of significance, the null 
hypothesis for the clinical goal will be tested at the 0.0 25 level.   If rejected, success will be 
declared for both Performance Goals .  Otherwise, if only the first (primary patency) null 
hypothesis can be rejected, succ ess will be declared only for that Performance Goal .  This 
sequential approach controls the overall significance level at 0.0 25.  Of note, no success can be 
declared if the null hypothesis for the primary patency goal was not rejected, regardless of the  
outcome for the other Performance Goal . 
 
For the primary patency endpoint, the proportion of subjects experiencing this outcome will be 
compared to the predefined Performance Goal  of 0.70. Formally, the hypothesis to be tested is:  
 
H0:  The incidence p PP of primary patency at 9-months is less than or equal to 0.70.  
 
Ho:   pPP ≤  0.70  
 
HA:          The incidence p PP of primary patency at 9-months is greater than 0.70.  
 
HA:  p PP  > 0. 70  
 
 
The derivation of the Performance G oal is described in Section 5.2.1 Derivation of the 
Performance Goal for Patency.

ARTISAN  
 
Amendment #1: 15Jul 13 Page 33 of 61 
iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 For the SBP endpoin t, the change between  SBP from baseline to 9 -month follow -up will be 
compared to a predefined Performance Goal  of 10mmHg. Formally, the hypothesis to be tested 
is: 
 
H0:  The mean difference between  SBP at 9-months  and baseline , μ∆SBP, is less than or equal  
to 10mmHg.  
Ho:   μ∆SBP   ≤  10mmHg  
 
HA:  The mean difference between  SBP at 9 -months  and baseline , μ∆SBP, is greater than 
10mmHg . 
 
Ho:   μ∆SBP   > 10mmHg  
 
Both primary endpoints will be tested in one -sided fashion against a significance level of 0.0 25; 
the primary patency endpoint will be tested using exact binomial methods and the SBP endpoint 
will be tested using a paired  t-test. 
 
5.2 SAMPLE SIZE  
For a one -sided alpha of 0.0 25 and desired power of 87%, sample size for the primary patency 
endpoint is establishe d by assuming a hypothesized primary patency incidence of 0.82, which 
gives 125 evaluable subjects  therefore,  accounting for 10% attrition, 138 subjects are needed for 
this endpoint. At the proposed evaluable sample size of 125, no more than 27 subjects ( 22%) can 
fail primary patency in order to meet the endpoint hypothesis . 
 
For the endpoint of reduction in SBP, we assume an average reduction of 13.7mmHg .  Under a 
hypothesized standard deviation of 12mmHg  for a difference in SBP there will be 92% power to 
meet the Performance G oal. This standard deviation is conservatively approximated based on the 
expected range of SBP at baseline of 155mmHg to 180mmHg divided by 3 and assuming a 
similar standard deviation at the 9 -month follow up. A mean difference in SBP at 9-months of 
12mmHg will be required in order to reject the null hypothesis at a one -sided alpha of 0.0 25 at 
the proposed sample size.  
 
The primary endpoints of primary patency and reduction in SBP are powered at 87% and 92%, 
respectively, in order to m aintain the overall trial power at 80% to meet both endpoints . 
 
5.2.1 DERIVATION OF THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR PATENCY  
The Performance Goal was derived from a thorough literature  review of trials with renal 
bare metal stent  placement. Trials were identified by mea ns of a PUBMED search of the 
English -language medical literature from 1991 to 2010.  When available, the following 
data were extracted: author and year of publication , number of  subjects , number  of

for PTRA of 40% as noted in Carr based on the analysis of 6 tri als with PTRA(1) and also 
used by Rocha -Singh,(2) a restenosis rate of 30% leading to a Performance Goal for 
primary patency set at 70% . This goal  will preserve at l east 50% of the difference 
between the currently available bare metal stent rate and the PTRA rate , as well as adjust 
for a lesion set with a higher percentage stenosis (80% -100%) than previous reported

95% confidence intervals.  In addition, survival curves will be constructed for all time -to-
event secondary endpoints using Kaplan -Meier methods.  
 
Statistical tests relating to the primary endpoints will be one -sided with p -values less  than 
0.025 deemed significant.   
 
Statistical analyses will be conducted in Statistical Analysis System ( SAS) version 9.1 or 
above (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) or another validated statistical software package.  
 
5.3.2 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
Intent -to-Treat (I TT) Analysis Set :  All subject s enrolled in the study will be included in 
the ITT analysis set. This will be the primary analysis set.  
 
Per Protocol Analysis Set :  All subject s enrolled in the study, who receive the study 
device as intended with no major protoc ol violations  (such as stent 
placement/deployment errors)  will be included in the Per Protocol analysis set.  The 
primary endpoints will be additionally tested in this analysis set.  
 
5.3.3 MISSING DATA  
Results from imputing all possible combinations of successes  and failures for the missing 
data will be summarized.  
 
5.3.4 MULTIPLICITY ADJUSTMENT  
Alpha for the primary hypotheses will be controlled by testing the endpoints 
hierarchically .  Patency will be tested first followed by  systolic  blood pressure.  The test 
for systolic blood pressure will only be conducted if the patency Performance Goal is 
met.   
 
Two additional secondary endpoints will be evaluated hierarchically if and only if the 
primary objective is met.  In order to control alpha, t he endpoint of clinically driven TLR 
will be tested as described below, followed by changes in the number or dosage of anti -
hypertensive medications as compared to baseline.

Adverse Events (AE ):  Any untoward medical occurrence observed in a patient or a clinical 
investigation subject  administered an investigational product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with t his treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the investigational intervention, whether or not considered related  to 
the investigational intervention. Pre -existing conditions, which worsen during a trial, are to be 
considered AEs.   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  Any adverse experience that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 Death 
 Is life -threatening  
 Subject  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 A persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Important medical event s that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death

7.1 DATA SAFETY MONITIORING BOARD (DSMB)  
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is composed of at least three  members which 
include physicians with specialization in the field of this trial and a biostatistician, and are 
independent and not directly involved in the conduct of the trial.  The DSMB will review the trial 
on a periodic basis to be defined in the Char ter.  
 
Based on the safety data, the DSMB may recommend to Atrium to modify or stop the trial.  All 
final decisions, however, regarding trial modifications, rest with Atrium.  No formal statistical 
rule for stopping the trial will be defined in this trial and no formal interim analysis is planned.   
 
7.2 CLINICAL EVENTS COMMITTEE (CEC)  
The Clinical Events Committee (CEC) is made up of physicians  with specialization in the field 
of this trial who are not participants in the trial.  The CEC is charged with the de velopment of 
specific criteria used for adjudication of clinical events related to the primary endpoints in the 
trial. 
 
At the onset of the trial, the CEC will develop a CEC Charter which will describe explicit rules 
outlining the minimum amount of data re quired, and the algorithm followed in order to classify a 
trial endpoint related clinical event.  The CEC will meet regularly (at a minimum of once per 
year) to review and adjudicate trial endpoint related clinical events in which the required 
minimum data  is not available. The CEC will also review and rule on all deaths that occur 
throughout the trial.  
 
Once the specific criteria for clinical events and endpoints are established, the CEC will be 
responsible for adjudicating all clinical events when all nec essary data are available.   
 
8.0  INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
The Investigator will ensure the trial will be performed in accordance  with the basic principles  of 
the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP): Consolidated Guideline s, 
ISO 14155,  and any applicable local or governmental regulations.  It is the responsibility of each

The protocol and any protocol amendments must be signed and dated by the Investigator and 
approved by the IRB /EC prior to implementation. No changes to the protocol ma y be made 
without th e agreement Atrium  or its designated CRO . Any amendment to the original protocol 
will be signed by both parties and submitted to the IRB/EC for approval or notification. 
Documentation of all study amendment activity should be forwarded to Atrium  or its designated 
CRO .  
8.3 INFORMED CONSENT  
Prior to participation in the trial, the IRB/EC approved written ICF should be signed and 
personally dated by the subject or his/her legal representative, and by the person who conducted 
the informed consent discussion (inves tigator or designee).  If the subject or his/her legal 
representative is unable to read the ICF, a witness should be present during the entire informed 
consent discussion.  After the ICF is read to the subject and signed by the subject or his/her legal 
representative, the witness should also sign the ICF, attesting that informed consent was freely 
given by the subject or his/her legal representative.  The informed consent process should be 
documented in each subject’s record.   
 
The subject or his/her legal  representative must receive a copy of the signed and dated ICF. The 
consent form should be updated or amended whenever new information becomes available that 
may be relevant to the subject.  
8.4 SOURCE DOCUMENTATION  REQUIREMENTS  
Regulations require that Invest igators maintain information in the trial subject’s medical records 
which corroborate data collected on the eCRF.  In order to comply with these regulatory 
requirements, the investigator will maintain and make available as required by monitors, Atrium 
or its designated CRO, and/or its regulatory inspectors the following information that includes 
but is not limited to:

8.5 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol  deviation is defined as an event where the Investigator or investigational site 
personnel did not conduct the trial according to the protocol.  Exa mples of deviations may 
include , enrollment of a trial subject who does not meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
specified in the protocol and missed trial visits.   
 
Atrium  will report all deviations annually as part of the IDE annual report  to th e appropriate 
regulatory authorities . 
 
Deviations shall be reported to Atrium or its designated CRO  regardless of whether medically 
justifiable or done  to protect the subject.  Non-subject specific deviations, (e.g. unauthorized use 
of an investigational d evice outside the trial, unauthorized use of an investigational device by a 
physician who has not signed an investigator agreement, etc.), will  also be reported to Atrium or 
its designated CRO  in writing .  Investigators will also adhere to procedures for r eporting 
protocol  deviations to their IRB /EC in accordance with their specific IRB /EC reporting policies 
and procedures.  Regulations require that Investigators maintain accurate, complete and current 
records, including documents showing the dates of and r eason s for each deviation from the 
protocol.  
8.6 DEVICE ACCOUNTABILITY  
The Investigator must ensure that the investigational product is used only in accordance with the 
approved protocol and administered only to subjects under the investigator’s supervision o r 
under the supervision of a sub -investigator. It is the responsibility of t he Investigator to maintain 
adequate accountability records of the receipt and disposition of all investigational devices . At 
the trial closeout visit, the Investigator must return  to Atrium or its designated CRO , any unused

Atrium or its designated CRO  will conduct investigational site monitoring visits to ensure that all 
Investigators conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol and Investigators’ agreements.  
The investigational site will receive notification prio r to each monitoring visit during the course 
of the trial.  It is expected that the Investigator and other appropriate staff are available on the 
day of the visit in case any questions might arise.   
 
The progress of the trial will be monitored by:  
 Ensurin g the completed eCRF matches the source documents, and resolution of any 
discrepancies.   
 Periodic on -site and off -site review . 
 Frequent telephone or electronic communications between the Investigator and site 
monitor’s . 
 Review of eCRF and clinical records /source documents. Direct access to complete source 
documents must be made available during monitoring visits for verification of case report 
form data.  
 
Periodic monitoring visits will be made at all active investigational sites throughout the clinical 
trial to assure that Investigator obligations are fulfilled and all applicable regulations and 
guidelines are being followed.  These visits will assure that the facilities are still acceptable, the 
protocol is being followed, the IRB/EC has been notified of approved protocol changes as 
required, complete records are being maintained, appropriate and timely repor ts have been made 
to Atrium or its designated CRO  and the IRB/EC, device and device inventory are controlled, 
and the Investigator is executing all ag reed activities.  
 
Atrium or its designated CRO  will retain the right to remove either the Investigator or the 
investigational site from the trial for issues of non -compliance with the protocol or regulatory 
requirements.  Atrium’s design ated CRO  will fulfi ll the responsibilities identified in their SOPs.

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 8.9 RECORD RETENTION  
The Investigator will maintain all essential trial documents and  source documentation, in original 
format, that support the data collected on the study subjects in compliance with the ICH/GCP 
guidelines. Documents must be retained for at least 2 years after the last marketing application 
approval or until at least 2 ye ars have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical 
investigation of the product.  These documents will be retained for a longer period of time by 
agreement with Atrium or in compliance with other regulatory requirements.  When these 
document s no longer need to be maintained, it is Atrium’s responsibility to inform the 
Investigator.  The Investigator will take measures to ensure that these essential documents are 
not accidentally damaged or destroyed.  If for any reason the Investigator withdr aws 
responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an 
individual who will assume responsibility. Atrium must receive written notification of this 
custodial change.  
8.10 PUBLICATION POLICIES  
At the conclusion of the ART ISAN trial, a multi -center manuscript will be prepared for 
publication in a reputable scientific journal.  The publication of the principal results from any 
single investigational site experience within the trial is not allowed until the preparation and 
publication of the multi -center results.  Exceptions to this rule require the prior approval of 
Atrium.  The analysis of pre -specified and non pre -specified endpoints will be performed by a 
statisti cian.  Such analyses, as well as other proposed investigatio ns will require the approval of 
Atrium .  For purposes of timely abstract presentation and publication, the writing of these 
secondary publications will be delegated to the appropriate principal authors, and final analyses 
and manuscript review for all mult i-center data will require the approval of Atrium.  
 
9.0 ROLE OF TRIAL SPONSOR  
 
As the Sponsor of this clinical trial, Atrium has the overall responsibility for the conduct of the 
trial, including assurance that the trial meets and is conducted w ithin the regulatory requirements 
specified by each reviewing regulatory authority. In this trial, Atrium will have certain direct 
responsibilities and will delegate other responsibilities to other designees.  Atrium or its 
designated CRO  will ensure adher ence to the Sponsor general duties, selection of Investigators, 
monitoring, supplemental applications, maintaining records, and submitting reports.  
9.1 GENERAL DUTIES  
Atrium’s general duties also include submission of application to the appropriate regulatory  
authorities and obtaining overall regulatory approval.

9.2 CRITERIA FOR SUSPEND ING/T ERMINATING AN 
INVESTIGATIONAL SITE  
Atrium reserves the right to stop the screening and enrollment of subjects at any investigational 
site at any time for any of the following reasons:  
 Noncompliance to GCP/ICH or protocol  
 Failure to obtain IRB/EC approval  
 Failure to enroll subjects  
 Multiple and/or severe protocol deviations  
 Inaccurate or incomplete data  
 Unsafe or unethical practices  
 Safety or performance considerations  
 Administrative decision  
 
NOTE:  If an investigational site is suspended or terminated, AE a ssessment and reporting (as 
outlined in this protocol) will continue for all subjects who received an investigational product.  
  
10.0 SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
Subject confidentiality will be maintained throughout the clinical trial in a way that assures that 
data can always be tracked back to the source data.  For this purpose, a unique subject 
identification code (i.e. assigned subject number and subject initials) will be used that allows 
identification of all data reported for each subject.  
Data relating to the trial might be made available to third parties (for example in case of an audit 
performed by regulatory authorities) provided the data are treated confidential and that the 
patient’s privacy is guaranteed.  
 
The Investigator will grant monitor(s) and au ditor(s) from Atrium or its designated CRO  and 
regulatory authorities access to the subject’s original medical records for verification of data 
gathered on the eCRF and to audit the data collection process. The subject’s confidentiality will 
be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by applicable laws 
and regulations.  
 
“Protected Health Information” will be maintained in compliance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy rule,  where applicable.

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 11.0 RISKS  TO SUBJECTS  
11.1 HUMAN SUBJECTS INVOLVEMENT AND CHARACTERISTICS  
This trial will enroll 138 adults with de novo atherosclerotic renal artery disease. The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.  Vulnerable 
populations, specifically prisoners, institutionalized individuals will not be targeted for 
recruitment.  Pregnant subjects are excluded because this product has no t been  investigated in 
this population and the risk to the fetus is unknown .   
11.2 POTENTIAL RISKS  
There may be a direct benefit to the subject as the iCAST™ RX Stent System allows for 
dilatation of the renal artery. This stent has the potential benefits of le ss injury due to the low 
profile delivery system and the metal stent is completely encapsulated with the ePTFE covering 
making it more stable and accurately deployed than other balloon expandable stents of similar 
diameters.  
 
There are risks for participa nts in this trial. Potential risks have been minimized by establishing 
strict inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure appropriate subjects participate in the trial.  
Additionally, all enrolling investigators will be instructed on appropriate patient selecti on, in an 
effort to minimize the risk of recruiting patients who are found to be ineligible for trial 
participation.    
 
To minimize the risk of the invasive assessment and the stent procedure, investigators will 
perform angiography and stent placement bas ed on:  current medical license, privileges to 
perform these services at their treatment center, board certification, or equivalent experience.  
Appropriate angiographic technique principles will be utilized to expose subjects to the least 
amount of contra st dye and radiation while providing high resolution angiograms.   
 
Some risks associated with surgery include but are not limited to adverse reactions to anesthesia, 
DVT, neurological cardiac or respiratory deficit, infection, continuation and/or worsenin g of the 
original diagnosis and death.  However, it should be noted that the risks of trial participation are 
not materially different than those entailed by an individual who undergoes a stent procedure 
with an approved stent. Table 6: Potential AEs Related to Stent Placement  outlines possible AEs 
related to stent placement :

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 APPENDIX 2: DEFINITI ONS  
 
ADVERSE EVENT  Any untoward medical occurrence observed in a 
patient or a clinical investigational subject. This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship 
between the AE and the device under investigation. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavo rable and 
unintended sign (including any clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the investigational 
intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational intervention. Pre -existi ng conditions, 
which worsen during a trial, are to be considered 
AEs.   
 
DE NOVO LESION  A lesion in a native vessel that has not been 
previously treated.  
 
DISSECTION  Renal artery dissections are stenotic or occlusive 
lesions most often observed in hypert ensive patients 
with underlying atherosclerosis or fibromuscular 
disease. Acute dissections may present 
spontaneously, as a complication of diagnostic or 
therapeutic angiography or as an agonal event 
associated with overwhelming systemic illness. 
Chronic d issections may produce renovascular 
hypertension or be entirely asymptomatic.  
 
 
DISTAL EMBOLIZATION  
 Free flowing blood clot or thrombus material located 
in the circulation distal to the treated occlusion.  
 
DUAL ANTI -PLATELET 
THERAPY  The use of thienopy ridine s in combination with 
aspirin therapy . 
 
EMBOLI  Something that blocks the flow of blood in a vessel. 
It may be a gas bubble, a blood clot, a fat globule, a 
mass of bacteria, or other foreign body that usually 
forms elsewhere and travels through the c irculatory 
system until it lodges in the vasculature .

HEMATOMA /HEMMORRHAGE  
 A swelling or collection of blood , usually clotted, in 
an organ, space, tissue, or access site  due to a break 
in the wall of a blood vessel. It could also be 
bleeding into an extravas cular space which could be 
outside the body.

NEW YORK HEART 
ASSOCIATION CLASSIFICATION  Class I:  The subject  has cardiac disease but without 
resulting limitations of ordinary physical activity. 
Ordinary physical activity (i.e ., walking several 
blocks or climbing stairs) does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. 
Limiting symptoms may occur with marked 
exertion.  
 
Class II:  The subject  has cardiac disease resulting in 
slight limitation of ordinary phys ical activity. 
Subject  is comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical 
activity such as walking more than two blocks or 
climbing more than one flight of stairs results in 
limiting symptoms (i.e., fatigue, palpitation, 
dyspnea, or anginal pain).  
 
Class III : The subject  has cardiac disease resulting in 
marked limitation of physical activity. Subject  is 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical 
activity such as walking one of two blocks or 
climbing one flight of stairs  causes fatigue, 
palpitation, dyspnea, or  anginal pain.  
 
Class IV : The subject  has dyspnea at rest that 
increases with any physical activity. Subject  has 
cardiac disease resulting in inability to perform any 
physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of 
cardiac insufficiency or anginal syndro me may be 
present even at rest. If any physical activity is 
undertaken, discomfort is increased.  
 
Q-WAVE MYOCARDIAL 
INFARCTION  The diagnosis of MI will be made on the basis of 
clinical information available from hospitalization 
(discharge summaries, labo ratory data, ECG) and 
will require an appropriate clinical history consistent 
with acute MI.

iCAST™ RX-ARAS -001 APPENDIX 3: METHODOLOGY FOR OFFICE -BASED B P 
MEASUREMENT  
 
The following techniques for blood pressure determination have been proposed by the AHA and 
represent the current gold standard.(37, 53) 
 
Blood pressure must be measured with certified, calibrated, and validated equipment.  The size 
of the bladder within the blood  pressure cuff must encircle at least 80% of the arm.  Subject s 
should be seated in a chair with their backs supported and their arms bared and supported at heart 
level with feet flat on the ground.  Subject s should refrain from exercise, smoking or caffei ne 
ingestion for 30 minutes before blood pressure measurement, and measurement should begin 
after at least 5 minutes of rest (seated comfortably as above). Subject s should also have emptied 
their bladder prior to obtaining the measurement as a full bladder  can affect the reading.  
 
 If necessary, blood pressure may be measured in the supine or reclining position.  
However, the subject  should then be in the same position for subsequent 
measurements.  
 
 Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be record ed, with the first 
appearance of sound used to define systolic blood pressure and the disappearance of 
sound used to define diastolic blood pressure.  
 
 A minimum of three (3) readings separated by 2 minutes should be averaged.  If the 
first 3 readings diffe r by >  5mmHg, additional readings should be obtained and 
averaged. Blood pressure should be measured in both arms, and the higher value 
obtained should be used.  
 
 Initial blood pressure should be measured in both arms, to identify which has the 
higher read ing.  From that point on, the arm with the higher reading becomes the “BP 
arm” for the remainder of the trial. For consistency, the site of blood pressure 
measurement should be recorded, and follow -up pressures should be maintained from 
the same arm.  The appropriately sized blood pressure cuff must again be used, and 
the site used must be well documented for future examinations.

1A minimum of t wo office visits  are required within the 14-day Medical Documentation S creening period . If the procedure is scheduled > 14 days from the first office visit, subjects should return every two weeks  
(+/- 3 days)  for BP assessments and monitoring.  
2Chem12 panel which includes: Glucose, Calcium, Albumin, Total protein, Sodium, Potassium, CO2, Chloride, B UN, creatinine, ALP, ALT, AST, and bilirubin.  
3 Test for proteinuria should be completed for subject s during Step 2 of the Medical Documentation Screening Period.  
4Pregnancy test required at screening and on the day of procedure for females  of childbearing  potential only.  
5 All subjects must have angiography to determine percent diameter stenosis prior to treatment and at 9 -months (if DUS indicates ≥ 60% stenosis).  
6 AE collection  (serious and non -serious)  will begin  upon completion of the ICF process throu gh the 9 -month follow -up visit, thereafter only SAEs and UADEs will be recorded.  
7 Subjects with a history of > 1 month stable medication per protocol and documented SBP ≥ 155mmHg will be allowed to skip the formal Screening period. All other protocol requ irements that would have 
normally occurred during the two week screening period must still be completed prior to day of procedure.

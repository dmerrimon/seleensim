amifampridine phosphate (3,4 -diaminopyridine phosphate)  
TITLE OF STUDY : 
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, Randomized, Outpatient Two- period 
Two-treatment  Crossover Study to Evaluate the Eff icacy and Safety of Amifampridine Phosphate 
(3,4- Diaminopyridine  Phosphate ) in Patients with certain Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes 
(CMS)  amenable to treatment.  
PROTOCOL NUMBER : 
CMS -001 
STUDY SITE :  
Multicenter at up to 5 sites in the United States  and 3  sites in Canada  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT : 
Phase 3  
OBJECTIVES:  
• To characterize the overall safety and tolerability of amifampridi ne phosphate  compared with  
placebo in patients with CMS ; and  
• To assess the clinical efficacy of amifampridine phosphate  compared with placebo in patients 
with CMS , based on improvement in subject global impression (SGI) and motor function 
measure (MFM 20  or 32) scores.  
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN:  
This randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo- controlled, outpatient two -period , two -treatment 
crossover study is  designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of amifampridine phosphate  in 
patients diagnosed with certain genetic subtypes of CMS  and demonstrated open label 
(amifampridine phosphate) or history of sustained amifampridine  benefit from treatment . After a 
period of unblinded drug escalation/treatment, blinded treatment effect will be assessed in a 
randomized fas hion of continuation or cessation of drug , each blinded treatment period separated 
by a stabilization period . The study is planned to include up to 23 male and female patients. The 
planned duration of participation for each patient is approximately 56 days, excluding the screening 
period, which can last up to 14 days.   
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5 Page 4 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   26 June 2017  
All patients will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study . Those  successfully 
completing screening will have procedures/assessments (see Table 3 ) completed on Day  1 of the 
run-in period. Patients who are previously naïve to amifampridine ( 3,4-DAP ) or amifampridine 
phosphate treatment will then begin open- label up- titration of medication, with frequent clinic 
visits /telephone  evaluation for up to 4 weeks during  run-in period, until stable dose and frequency 
of amifampridine phosphate  is achieved  for 7 days . At the end of the 7 days of stable dosing, there 
must be demonstrated efficacy as assessed by improvement on the MFM 20 or 32 in order for the 
patient to participate in the randomized two -period, two- treatment crossover portion of the study .  
Patients on a  stable dose of amifampridine phosphate with a history of meaningful 
improvement in motor function are eligible immediately for randomization. Those who are 
on a stable pre- trial dose of 3,4-DAP  will be transitioned to equivalent dose of amifampridine 
phosphate for 7 days. At this point ( labeled Day  0) the patient will be randomized to a Treatment 
Sequence and undergo procedures/assessments ( Table 3 ). Study medication at the stable dose or 
placebo, will be dispensed by the site pharmacist, according to the randomization schedule, 
beginning with the dose following completion of assessments on Day 0 and  for the 8 day Period 1.  
Following experimental P eriod 1, patients will be returned to the stable dose administered at the 
end of the open- label run -in period from days 9 -21, follow ed by Period 2 dosing for 8 days  (Days 
22-29). Patients who were on a stable does of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful 
improvement prior to randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose from 
days 9 -21, followed by Period 2 dosing for 8 days (Days 22 -29).  
After co mpletion of Period 2, patients will be eligible for expanded access with restoration of open-
label amifampridine phosphate at the same dose and frequency as established in the run -in phase of 
the study. Patients who were on stable dose of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful 
improvement prior to randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose and 
frequency during their participation in the expanded access program.   
Open -label Run -in 
Patients who are naïve to amifampridine or amifampridine phosphate treatment are each potentially 
eligible, but the pathway to enrollment depends upon previous drug exposure and efficacy. For 
those naïve to either, a mifampridine phosphate  dose may  be titrated upward every 3 to 4 days, per 
the dosing guidelines in Table 4 , at the discretion of the investigator, for up to 4 weeks, including 1 
week of stable dose and frequency before b eing random ized to a Treatment Sequence in Period 1. 
Measurements of clinical improvement will be administered at the outset and repeated as clinically 
indicated during the titration period, to assess open -label efficacy . Dosing can be increased or 
decreas ed by the investigator during the run- in phase. Enrollment and r andomization for patients in 
this group of initially drug -naïve patients can only occur after  achievement of  stable dose for at 
least 7 days  with demonstrated 20% or greater improvement in MFM  20 or 32 (depending on the 
age of patient)  compared to  Day 1 r un-in assessment .

Proprietary and Confidential   26 June 2017  
Patients al ready receiving 3,4-DAP  or amifampridine phosphate  treatment for CMS , and  meeting 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria are elig ible to participate in this study . The patient should 
report or investigator judges there is a history of improvement on 3,4- DAP  or amifampridine 
phosphate treatment ; improvement of at least 20% in MFM 20 or 32 is not a requirement for these 
participants . They can be randomized into Period 1 if on stable dose and frequency of 
amifampridine phosphate for at least 1 week before being random ized to a Treatment Sequence .   
Treatment Group A or B  
Period 1 (Days 1 -8) (+1 day)  
Patients who have successfully completed the open- label run- in and continue to meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1 ratio)  on the last day of the run -in period 
(Day  0) to either Sequence 1 or 2 and commence Period  1 for the respective Treatment Sequence . 
Only after assessments are completed on Day  0, the patient will begin to receive either 
amifampridine phosphate  tablets or placebo tablets for 8 days as an outpatient , with a  dose of the 
same medication on the day of scheduled study visit ( Day 8 ) in the clinic , in order to facilitate 
efficacy assessments, under double -blind conditions. If the patient is on a BID or TID reg imen 
during P eriod 1, the Day 8 assessments should occur after the same dose that corresponds to when 
assessments were done on Day 0.  Any unused portion of double -blind dispensed drug will be 
returned to the  site before dispensing drug for the Re -Stabilization Period.   
Re-Stabilization Period  (Days 9-21) (+1 day)  
Patients will be administered amifampridine phosphate  at the same dose and frequency established 
as the stable dose in the open -label run- in phase for a 14- day period, under open- label conditions.  
Patients who were on stable dose of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful 
improvement prior to randomization in study CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose 
and frequency during the re -stabilization period.  
Period 2 (Days 22 -29) (+1 day)  
After completion of Period 1 and the re-stabilization period, according to randomization sequence, 
patients will receive the blinded study medication/placebo for Period 2 for 8 days (Day 22 – 29) as 
an outpatient with  a dose of the same medication on the day of scheduled study visit (Day 29 ) in 
the clinic , in order to facilitate efficacy assessments, under double -blind conditions. If the patient is 
on a BID or TID reg imen during P eriod 2, the Day 29 assessments should occur after the same 
dose that corresponds to when assessments were done on Day 0 . Any unused portion of double -
blind dispensed drug wi ll be returned to the site  before enrolling the patient in the expanded access 
program and dispensing open- label drug.  
During all phases of the study, safety and efficacy assessments will be performed  as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments in Table 3  and Section 13.  
NUMBER OF PATIEN TS PLANNED:

in round, white -scored tablets , containing amifampridine phosphate formulated to be the equivalent 
of 10 mg amifampridine base per tablet.  The total daily dose will be individually determined by the 
investigator, within the bounds of a total daily dose of 10 mg to 80 mg, divided into doses taken 
2 to 4 times per day as prescribed by the investigator, based on optimal neuromuscular benefit . 
Amifampridine phosphate  tablets are to  be taken orally by mouth with food throughout the study . 
Children unable to swallow tablets will have the tablets crushed and mixed with a small amount of 
food, and children with a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube will have the tablets crushed and diluted 
in 5 to 10 mL of wa ter and given through the tube. Score d tablet can  be split to obtain 5 mg dose, if 
required.  
 
The investigational product, and matching placebo, will be provided by Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., 355 Alhambra Circle, Suite 1250, Coral Gables, Florida, 33134, United States. 
 
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE, ROUTE, AND REGIMEN:  
The reference therapy is a placebo, provided as tablets indistinguishable from amifampridine 
tablets. The placebo will be administered consistent with the dose and dose regimen of the 
investigational product ( amifampridine phosphate ).

in. 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION : 
Safety:  
Safety will be assessed by the incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including 
serious adverse events (SAEs) . Vital signs, 12- lead ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, physical 
examination, and concomitant medications will also be evaluated.  
Efficacy:  
Efficacy will be assessed by  comparison of amifampridine phosphate  versus placebo for:  
• SGI;  
• MFM 20  or 32 ( MFM 20 ( individual  <7 years) and MFM 32 ( individual  ≥ 7 years) ); 
• Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI -S); and  
• Clinical Global Impression -Improvement (CGI -I). 
 
Optional tests  to be performed are;  
• Stimulated s ingle fiber electromyogram ( SFEMG)  
• “Slurp” test  
 
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size Determination  
Assuming a standardized between -treatment difference of 0.5, 23 patients per sequence 
will ensure power of 90% for the 2- sided test at the 0.05 level  using the standard 2- by-2 
crossover analysis .  
Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population (i.e. a ll patients who receive at least 
1 dose of amifampridine phosphate  or placebo) . The safety analysis will be descriptive and will be 
presented on observed data only . 
CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5 Page 9 
Proprietary and Confidential 26 June 2017  
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy will be described for 2 datasets:  
•Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized patients who receive
at least 1 dose of IP ( amifampridine phosphate or placebo) and have at least one post-
treatment efficacy assessment.
•Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patientswith major protocol deviations.
If the PP Population is the same as the FAS, then the results will be presented only for the FAS. 
Exclusion from the FAS and PP Population will be finalized prior to database lock and 
subsequent unblinding. 
Summary statistics will be provided by treatment and period for CGI- I, CGI-S, Change From 
Baseline (CFB) for CGI -S, the optional Slurp Test, and variables associated with the optional 
SFEMG.  
T
he analysis of CFB for SGI is the primary efficacy analysis and will be performed using the 
standard analysis for a 2 -by-2 crossover design. Summary statistics for SGI and CFB for SGI 
will be presented by treatment and period. P- values <0.05 wil be considered statistically 
significant.  
T
he total score for MFM and the subtotal for each of the three dimensions (Standing and 
transfer, Axial and proximal motor function, and Distal motor function) will be standardized by 
the possible maximum for both MFM 20 and MFM 32. The CFB for these standardized scores 
will be analyzed using the standard analysis for a 2 -by-2 crossover design for MFM 20 and 
MFM 32 separately and pooled, with the latter being the secondary and the separate analyses 
being supportive. The total scores, subtotals for each dimension, and the corresponding 
standardized scores w ill be summarized by treatment and period for MFM 20 and MFM 32 
separately and standardized scores will be summarized by treatment and period for MFM 20 and MFM 32 pooled. P- values <0.05 wil be considered statistically significant.

8 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive r eview of amifampridine phosphate  is contained in the Firdapse® 
Investigator’s Brochure supplied by Catalyst  (February 2015) . Investigators are to review this 
document before  initiating this study.  
8.1 Disease Background  
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the specialized synapse between the motor nerve 
terminal and the muscle fiber. Defects in NMJ function present with variable and often 
fluctuant symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, droopy eyelids, double vision, 
swallowing and breathing difficulties. NM J disorders are both inherited and acquired in 
nature. Congenital myastheni c syndromes (CMS) are a group of heterogeneous inherited 
disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins essential for the integrity of 
neuromuscular transmission. Most CMS  are caused by molecular defects in the muscle 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, but they can also be caused by mutations in presynaptic 
proteins, mutation in proteins associated with the synaptic basal lamina, defects in endplate 
development and maintenance, or defects in protein glycosylation (Engel, 2007) . More than 
20 different genetic muta tions at the pre synaptic, synaptic , and post synaptic level of 
neuromuscular junction have been described.  
CMS is rare, estimated at one- tenth that of myasthenia gravis, which in itself is rare 
(estimated at 25 to 125 per million) ( Eymard, 2013; Abicht, 2012). Worldwide, 
approximately 2,000 to 3,000 patients have been diagnosed on a molecular level (Schara, 
2012) . A recent report on genetically -confirmed CMS cases in the United Kingdom indicates 
a prevalence of 9.2 per million in children under 18 years of age, equally affecting girls and 
boys (Parr, 2014) . 
CMS is characterized by fatigable weakness of skeletal muscle (ocular, bulbar, limb 
muscles), with an onset typically at birth or early childhood, although rarely it can manifest 
in adolescence and adulthood ( Abicht, 2012; Schara, 2012). Clinically, hypotonia is 
common, as are ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, dysphonia and swallowing disturbance, facial 
paresis, and progressive muscle weakness ( Eymar d, 2013; Abicht, 2012).  The severity and 
clinical course of the disease are highly variable, reflective of the underlying genetic defect.  
The diagnosis and management of children with CMS is challenging and response to 
treatment in  CMS depends on the type of defect (pre -synaptic, synaptic , post -synaptic) and 
the kinetics of the channel affected (fast versus slow). Most patients are eligible and respond 
to pharmacologic intervention, including esterase inhibitors, 3,4- diaminopyridine  (3,4- DAP), 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5 Page 21 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   26 June 2017  
ephedrine, fluoxetine or quinidine, and albuterol ( Eymard, 2013; Abicht, 2012; Schara, 2012; 
Engel, 2007 ). The particular therapy is dictated by  the diagnosed CMS subtype, as drugs 
beneficial in one subtype can be detrimental in another subtype . 
8.2 Amifampridine  
Amifampridine (3,4- DAP) is a non- specific voltage -dependent potassium (K+) channel 
blocker used to treat many of the congenital myasthenic syndromes, particularly those with 
defects in choline acetyltransferase, downstream kinase 7, and those where any kind of defect 
causes “fast channel” behavior of the AChR. Its blockade of K+ channels causes 
depolarization of the presynaptic membrane and s lows down or inhibits the repolarization  
phase of an action potential . Prolong ation of the action potential duration increased opening 
of pre -synaptic slow voltage -dependent calcium (Ca2+) channels , increasing  Ca2+ influx and 
consequent increase in synapt ic vesicle exocytosis (quantal content) with each depolarization 
event , thus releasing an increased level of ACh into the synaptic cleft ( Maddison, 1998a ; 
Maddison, 1998b)  The influx of ACh into the presynaptic cleft enhances neuromuscular 
transmission, providing improved muscle function  in those cases of CMS where defects of 
diminished post -synaptic response are demonstrated or postulated.  
Over the last 25 years, a considerable amount of clinical experience with amifampridine has 
been gained, which provides a strong body of evidence for its efficacy and safety in the 
treatment of patients with neurologic disorders, including MG, CMS, Lambert -Eaton 
myasthenic syndrome (LEMS),  multiple sclerosis (MS), d ownbeat nystagmus, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Amifampridine has been recommended as first -line 
symptomatic treatment for LEMS  by the European Federation of Neurological Societies 
(EFNS) ( Skeie, 2006; Skeie, 2010; Lindquist, 2011)  and amifampridine tablets 10 mg  (as 
amifampridine phosphate ) (Firdapse® Tablets) is marketed for the treatment of LEMS in the 
European Union (including Norway and Iceland), Israel, and Switzerl and. The collective 
body of data indicates that amifampridine/ amifampridine phosphate is well tolerated up to 
and including 80 mg/day ( Firdapse Investigator Brochure, February 2015).  
8.3 Nonclinical Studies  
An extensive nonclinical program assessed the safety  and absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of amifampridine , 
including:  
 CMS -001

• Five safety pharmacology studies in central nervous system (rat) , respiratory (rat),  
and cardiovascular ( telemeterized dogs, in  vitro human Ether -à-go-go Related Gene  
(hERG) and rabbit Purkinje fiber)  
• Pharmacokinetics and mass balance in rat and dog  
• In vitro metabolism in human and animal hepatocytes  
• Human hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition and induction  
• Human P -glyco protein (Pgp) interaction  
• Single dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) studies in mouse and rat  
• Repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic in rat  (28-day and 13- week)  and  
dog (28 -day and 9 -month)  
• Reproductive and developmental toxicity in rat and rabbit  
• Six in vitro and  in vivo  genotoxicity studies  
Safety factors based on data from the 4 -week toxicity /TK studies in rat and dog, the 13 -week 
toxicity/TK study in rats along with a PK study in fasted rats are presented in  Table 2. Peak 
plasma concentration  (Cmax) values were used in calculating the exposure- based safety 
factors as the central nervous system ( CNS ) and autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) effects are 
correlated to plasma concentration levels. C max data from the bioavailability/bioequivalence 
study in healthy volunteers were used to compare with animal C max data. Human safety 
factors calculated using mean C max from a PK study in fasted rat s are 2.8 (male) and 7.8 
(female ). The safety factor based on average C max in male and female dog  versus human is 
1.2 and 1.1, respectively.

The main nonclinical findings of CNS and ANS effects and histologic changes in muscle 
tissues after administration of amifampridine are in accordance with the mechanism of 
action. No new treatment -related findings in the nonclinical program have been observed  that 
would limit the use of amifampridine at the planned clinical maximum daily oral dose of 60 
mg (≤16 years of age) and 80 mg (>16 years of age) in this study involving patients with 
CMS . 
8.4 Previous Clinical Studies  
Amifampridine  has been used for over 25 years in patients with multiple neurologic disorders 
including MG, CMS , LEMS , MS, ALS, congenital forms of nystagmus , and adult idiopathic 
nystagmus (AIN) . There are a limited number of published controlled trials with 
amifampridine in these disorders. A review of the literature documents that amifampridine is 
a safe and effective treatment in multiple neurologic disorders and is recommended by the 
EFNS for first -line symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS  (Skeie, 2006; Skeie, 2010; 
Lindquist, 2011) .

8.4.1 Amifampridine Phosphate in Healthy Subjects  
A first in human Phase 1 study (DAPSEL  Study, 2006) with amifampridine phosphate was 
conducted to investigate the bioavailability/bioequi valence and tolerability of amifampridine 
administered as a phosphate salt or free base. In the first part of the study, a pilot tolerance 
study was conducted in 5 healthy male volunteers who received a single 10 -mg dose of 
amifampridine phosphate to deter mine tolerability. In the second part of the study, 
bioequivalence testing was conducted in 27 healthy male volunteers. Each patient was 
randomized to receive either a single dose (2 ×  10 mg tablets) of amifampridine as 
amifampridine phosphate or amifampri dine base and received alternate treatment following a 
minimum of 72 -hour washout period. 
This study demonstrated bioequivalence for  area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
from time 0 to infinity  (AUC 0-∞), with the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the base/salt ratio 
of 93.1%  to 113.3% falling within the predefined limits of 90% to 125% for bioequivalence. 
The mean elimination half -life ( t1/2) of amifampridine was 1.8  hours for the phosphate and 
1.6 hours for the  free base form . Amifampridine C max was 64.8 ng/mL for the phosphate and 
57.0 ng/mL for the free base form. Potentially improved absorption of the phosphate salt 
explained the slightly higher C max observed for amifampridine phosphate compared with the 
free base.  All adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, transitory and fully reversible . 
The nature and frequency of side -effects did not differ between formulations (phosphate salt 
or base) . The most common AE (25 of 40 AEs) was paresthesia, which was mainly minor 
peri-oral paresthesia. Since paresthesia is well recognized as an AE occurring in patients 
treated with amifampridine, all were considered as possibly related to  investigational product 
(IP) by the investigator. The only other AE occurring in >1 patient and judged possibly 
related to  amifampridine was abdominal pain (4 events). Simple flu (5 events) and feeling of 
discomfort (2 events) were also reported for >  1 patient in the study, however were 
considered not related to amifampridine treatment.  
The only SAEs reported in the study we re minor, isolated, and reversible increases in 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which occurred in a 
single patient after administration of 20  mg amifampridine base . Aside from this 1 patient, no 
other laboratory abnorma lities were observed. No electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities 
were observed. No deaths occurred in the DAPSEL study.  
A Phase 1 study (LMS -001) in healthy volunteers evaluated whether food consumption 
significantly affected  the bioavailability of amifampr idine phosphate tablets. This was  an 
open- label, randomized, single -dose, 2- treatment, 2- period crossover design in 46 healthy 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5 Page 25 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   26 June 2017  
volunteers . Each patient received 20  mg amifampridine phosphate on 2 occasions, once 
fasting and once after consumption of a standard high fat breakfast . The 2 single 20 mg doses 
of amifampridine phosphate were administered 6 days apart . Data indicate that taking 
amifampridine with food reduces exposures determined by C max (maximum serum levels) by 
approximately  40% and AUC by approximately  20%. In addition, the time to maximum 
serum concen trations (T max) was increased 2 -fold from approximately  38 minutes (fasted ) to 
78 minutes (fed) . The drug was well tolerated with no ser ious adverse events and only 1 
severe event, an episode of gastroenteritis unrelated to amifampridine . The most common 
adverse events occurring in ≥  10% of patient s were: oral paresthesia (20  patients ; 43%),  
peripheral paresthesias (12; 26%), dizziness (5;  11%), headache (5;  11%), and oral 
hypoesthesia (5; 11%) . Abdominal pain, nausea, peripheral paresthesias, dizziness, and 
headache were more commonly reported by patient s following administration of 
amifampridine phosphate in the fasted state ; therefore, a dministration with food is 
recommended  based on the current study . 
In both Study LMS -001 and DAPSEL, PK parameters were highly variable with 10- fold 
ranges observed in values of C max, AUC, and t ½ across patient s. In humans, a mifampridine is  
exclusively met abolized to a single major  metabolite, 3- N-acetyl amifampridine , via N -acetyl 
transferases (NAT ) (Catalyst  internal in vitro  and in vivo  studies; data available upon 
request). There are 2 NAT enzymes, NAT1 and NAT2, both of which are principally hepatic 
and both of which are highly polymorphic . These allelic variations lead to slow and fast 
metabolism variations , which have been well characterized in the Caucasian and Asian 
populations , but somewhat less well in African populations ( Sabbagh, 2006 ). Slow 
acetylators are estimated to comprise 50 % to 59% of the Caucasian population, w ith the 
remainder being rapid acety lators (fast + intermediate) . Fast acetylators are o ver represented 
in Asian population (92% of Japanese and 80% of Chinese) while they may be under 
represented in African populations (25%)  (Cascorbi, 1995).  Slow acetylators will accumulate 
drug to higher  levels (i .e. higher C max) and clear drug more slowly (i .e. longer t 1/2), both of 
which may increase the risk of drug related  toxicity (Fukino, 2008; Jetter, 2009) . It is 
hypothesized that  the high variability in amifampridine phosphate PK may be due to NAT 
polymorphism s with slow and fast acetylator  phenotypes. In a study (FIR -001) that evaluated 
the effect of acetylator status  in 26 healthy subjects (half with fast and half with slow 
acetylator phenotypes) , polymorphisms in the NAT system created 3-  to 4- fold differences in 
plasma amifampridine levels.  Potentially information relating NAT genotype and 
amifampridine phosphate PK could be used to inform dose selection for individual patients  
and to lower incidence of dose -related side effects .

8.4.2 Efficacy of Amifampridine in CMS  
Efficacy of 3,4 -DAP in patients with CMS has been reported in the published literature . Few 
clinical studies are reported , with most reports being case series or case reports.  An open 
prospective trial conducted by Palace and colleagues ( 1991) reported improvement with oral 
3,4-DAP in c ongenital myasthenia syndrome in 16 patients ( 8 males and 8 females ) ranging 
in age from 7 to 47 years. All but  1 patient showed improvement in strength scores, and the 
group as a whole showed highly significant increase in muscle strength. Although this study 
included younger patients, only 2 patients  were less than 10 years of age, and genetic 
etiology for congenital myasthenia was unknown with outcome measures largely dependent 
on patient cooperation and motivation. One death of 5- year-old girl with severe congenial 
myasthenia who developed fatal pneumonia after several weeks of 3,4 -DAP, though not 
thought to hav e contributed to this event. Anlar and colleagues ( 1996 ) conducted a double -
blinded, placebo- controlled, crossover study investigating the effects of 3,4 -DAP in 11 
patients ( 5-24 years  of age)  with either a diagnosis of congenital myasthenia gravis (CMG) or 
juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMS). None of the 5 JM S patients responded to 3,4- DAP 
treatment. Five of the  6 CMG  patients showed clinical improvement, with place bo effect 
noted in 3 patients. The authors concluded that 3,4 -DAP treatment may be beneficial in some 
CMG patients but may have different effects on various presynaptic and postsynaptic defects 
of neuromuscular transmission resulting in CMS.  
With the advancements of whole -exome sequenci ng, approximately 20 CMS disease genes 
have been identified. Harper and Enge l’s open- label uncontrolled study ( 2000) was the first 
to look at patients with different mutation forms of CMS. With a total of 31 patients, this 
study sh owed all patients with fast- channel CMS had sustained improvement  and about one -
third  of AC hR deficiency patients had sustained improvement. A  handful of case reports and 
case series has also shown the efficacy of 3,4 -DAP in different mutation forms of CMS . 
Beeson and colleagues  (2005) reported 19 patients with CMS who received 3,4- DAP (doses 
not specified), with 15 maintained on their existing anti- AChE medication. Good response to 
3,4-DAP was observed in CMS due to mut ations of the following genes: MuSK (n=1), 
CHRNE  (n=4), COLQ (n=1), RAPSN  (n=1), and unknown (n=6). For the patient with COLQ-
CMS, a positive effect was found at 26 years of age, with a clear gain of ax ial and limb 
strength. In a single report  (Mazell, 2015) , use of 3,4- DAP in a 4 -year-old girl with well -
defined CHRNE -CMS  showed promising results  using stimulated jitter analysis and MFM  
score as outcome measures. In long- term follow -up of 15 COLQ- CMS patients  ranging in 
age from 3 to 48 years  (mean 19  years) , all relapses ended spontaneously or with 3,4- DAP 
(30 to 60 mg daily) or ephedrine with no residual impairment  (Wargon, 2012) . Associated

respiratory crises were re ported in 3 of the 8 patients. From a pediatric stand point, this 
adverse event was significant as puberty was identified as a triggering factor in 6 of 
8 patients.  
Two children with RAPSN -CMS improved clinically with the addition of 3,4- DAP in 
conjunction with pyridostigmine  (Banwell, 2004) . Clinically, both children manifested with 
hypomotility in  utero , fatigable ocular and limb weakness since birth, decreased strength 
during viral illness, decremental response on EMG, and absence of AChR antibodies. One 
child had a more sev ere clinical course with recurrent episodes of respiratory failure, 
contractures, and craniofacial malformations. The addition of 3,4- DAP in this 14- year-old 
boy led to increased endurance and a marked reduction in fatigable weakness. In the second 
child, a 9 -year-old girl maintained on pyridostigmine since 4 months of age, experienced 
significant improvement in endurance after treatment with 3,4- DAP, allowing for increased 
activity (i.e.  jump rope, run, participate in dance, ride a horse). In another repor t of 11 
patients with RAPSN -CMS , addition of 3,4- DAP to the pyridostigmine regimen resulted  in 
further clinical improvement (Milone, 2009) . 
Four reports have evaluated 3,4- DAP in DOK -7-CMS. Ben Ammar and colleagues (2010)  
found that 7 of 9 patients (5 males, 4 females ranging in age from 18 to 69 years) improved 
on 3,4- DAP alone (doses not specified). In another report (Anderson, 2008)  where 3 patients 
received 3,4- DAP a lone (doses not specified) and 3 patients  received 3,4- DAP in 
combination with pyridostigmine  or ephedrine , all 6 patients improved with treatment.  
Selcen and colleagues  (2008)  report 9  patients (3 males, 6 females ranging in age from 5 to 
50 years) who received 3,4 -DAP alone (n=4), or in combination with pyridostig mine (n=3) 
or ephedrine (n=2). One of the 2 children improved on 3, 4-  DAP (10  mg TID), whereas the 
other child became worse after 3,4 -DAP (5  mg TID) was added to her pyridostigmine 
regimen ; 4 of 7 adults improved. Lashley and colleagues (2010)  report follow -up of 10 
patients with DOK -7-CMS mainly treated with ephedrine, with 2 patients (29 and 42 years of 
age) continued on 3,4 -DAP treatment (15 or 30 mg QID). All patients improved over 6 to 
8 months of follow -up. 
With respect to DPAGT1 -CMS , Finlayson and colleagues (2013)  report 5 patients (2 males, 
3 females ranging in age from 6 to 58 years) , with 2 of 3 patients who received 3,4- DAP 
(doses not specified) ha ving a favorable response to treatment. In another report, 2 children 
(both girls, 13 and 14 years of age) who received 3,4- DAP did not improve:  one was  on 
3,4-DAP (30  mg/day) plus pyridostigmine and the other on 3,4- DAP (10 mg)  (Selecen, 
2014) .

Two patients (7 and 48 years of age) with presynaptic CMS (with reduced quantal release) 
who had severe generalized  weakness since early infancy  initially responded to 3,4- DAP 
(dose not specified) and pyridostigmine, but then became refrac tory to treatment (Beeson, 
2005) . Both patients were wheelchair -bound and had multiple skeletal deformities. The 
younger patient could not speak or swallow and was respirator -dependent . In another report 
(Kinali, 2008) , 4 of 5 children with CMS who received pyridostigmine and 3,4- DAP (doses 
not specified ) showed a positive response.  
8.4.3 Efficacy of Amifampridine in LEMS  
A Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study (LMS -002) evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of amifampridine tablets 10 mg, as amifampridine phosphate (30- 80 mg 
total daily dose)  versus placebo in patients with LEMS . The  study has  4 parts, with the first 
3 parts complete in the clinic (open -label extension ongoing). P atients treated with 
amifampridine phosphate had stat istically significant improvement in both primary efficacy 
measures relative to patients treated with placebo. The  change in QMG scores from baseline 
(Day 1, Part  2) to Day 14 (Part 3) reached statistical significance  (p=0.0452), with the least 
square (LS) mean for QMG score increasing by 2.2 in placebo -treated patients, and 
increasing by 0.4 in amifampridine -treated patients. For the other primary endpoint, subject 
global impression ( SGI), patients who were receiving amifampridine on Day  1 reported, on 
average, that they were “pleased” (SGI score of 5.9  ± 1.2) with the test medication while they 
were receiving it. Aft er being switched to placebo tablets, their opinions dropped, on 
average, 2.7 ±2.3 points. The LS mean was -2.6 for the placebo group and - 0.8 for the 
amifampridine group, a difference of 1.8 ±0.6 (p=0.0028), corresponding to a patient 
assessment, of “mixed” for the placebo tablets. This substantial change in patients’ 
assessments, to a worsening of their condition while receiving placebo, was considered 
clinically significant.  
In addition to Study LMS -002, 5 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled studies and 
1 double -blind study with an active comparator (reported in abstract form only) in 71 patients 
with LEMS are reported in the clinical literature . In all 6  studies, amifampridine (in base 
form) was shown to be more effective for the symptomatic tre atment of  LEMS compared 
with placebo or active comparator across a number of independent measures of neurological 
function. Supportive data  from multiple published uncontrolled investigations and case 
reports demonstrate the long -term benefits of treatment with amifampridine in patients with 
LEMS , and show that removal of patients from drug has led to recurrence of underlying

symptoms. Refer to the Firdapse Investigator Brochure (February , 2015)  for further details 
on these studies. 
8.4.4 Safety of Amifampridine and Amifampridine Phosphate  
Safety data collected from 1,454 patien ts or healthy volunteers in controlled study LMS -002 
(LEMS)  described above in Section  8.4.3, controlled and uncontrolled published studies  of 
LEMS or other neurologic conditions , a 3-year safety surveillance study (ATU), and PK 
studies demonstrate amifampridine is well tolerated up to and including 80 mg/day  (Firdapse 
Investigator Brochure, February 2015 ). The most common adverse events observed from the 
clinical safety data were perioral and peripheral par esthesias and gastrointestinal disorders  
(abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, epigastralgia ).  These events were typically mild or  
moderate in severity, and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from 
treatment.  In the pharmacogenomic study in healthy subjects (classified as either slow 
acetylators or fast acetylators), slow acetylators experienced >80% more drug -related AEs 
compared with fast acetylators (FIR -001).  
Clinically significant or s erious adverse events were infrequent in all studies for all 
indications. A total of 12 deaths were reported in the 1,454 patients or healthy s ubjects. Six 
of 12 deaths were ass ociated with accompanying malignancy (1 of 6 with pulmonary 
embolus as terminal event), 1 due to tracheobronchitis, and 2 due to myocardial infarction 
(MI).  Attribution to amifampridine for 2 of 3 deaths  from the ATU study was specified as 
unrelated; causality for the third death was not reported. No attribution was specified in the 
academic series, but the author singled out the fatal MI as the only serious incident during 
amifampridine therapy, implying that the 2  deaths due to malignancy, the 1 due to 
malignancy and pulmonary embolus and the 1 due to tracheobronchitis were not related in 
his opinion. The author further states that no pathological findings related to amifampridine 
were found in the patient who died of tracheobronchitis. For 1 of the fatal MIs, the author 
speculates that a “sudden increase of physical activity” with amifampridine may have been a 
contributant  (Lundh, 1984; Lundh, 1993) ; no causality was reported for the other fatal MI 
(Bertorini, 2011) . Three deaths occurred in children with CMS, including 2 with fast -channel 
CMS (Beeson, 2005) . Although no causal relationship was established with amifampridine, 
the authors advise its use cautiously in children and in fast -channel patients. The other CMS 
death was not thought to be related to amifampridine (Palace, 1991) . Overall 7 of 12 deaths 
were not considered related  to amifampridine; neither cause nor causality is known for 4 
deaths; and amifampridine may have contributed indirectly to 1 of the MI -related deaths.

The most frequent clinically significant or serious e vent was seizure. A total of 10 ( 0.69%) 
patients out of 1,454 patients or healthy subjects experienced seizures or convulsions after 
treatment with amifampridine. E lectroencephalogram  findings, reported for 3 of the 10 
patients, did not show epileptiform a ctivity. Three of 10 seizures occurred in patients with 
LEMS (3/ 209; 1.44%), 4  occurred in patients with MS (4/774; 0.5%), 1 occurred in a patient 
with CMS (1/88; 1.14%) (Harper, 2000)  and 2 seizures were reported in a literature -based 
study where both MG and LEMS patients were enrolled, but the paper did not state the 
indication  (Sanders, 1993; Sanders, 2000; Flet, 2010; McEvoy, 1989; Boerma, 1995;  Bever, 
1996) . No seizures have been reported in patients or healthy volunteers taking Firdapse since 
its commercial approval in December 2009 through 23 December  2014.  
Amifampridine was implicated in at least 4 of these cases of seizure. Three patients 
experienced seizures on a daily dose of ≥90 mg/day (n=3; LEMS or MG). No other cause 
was apparent in 2 cases; 1 patient had concurrent toxi c serum levels of theophylline 
(McEvoy, 1989; Sanders, 1993) . A fourth patient with LEMS had multiple seizures 
following accidental ingestion of 360 mg/day amifampridine for  7 days (prescribed dose 
60 mg/day)  (Boerma, 1995) . There were potentially contributing conditions in 6 patients, 
specifically, concurrent treatment with theophylline (n=1; LEMS or MG), or coexistent brain 
metastases (n=1; LEMS), epilepsy (n=1; MS) and MS (n=4). In cases where follow -up was 
reported, most seizure s did not recur with amifampridine dose reduction or treatment 
withdrawal. In the one accidental overdose case, seizures were controlled with intravenous 
clonazepam and the patient made a full recovery  (Boerma, 1995) . Note that a s eizure rate of 
4% can be expected in the natu ral course of patients with MS (Engelsen, 1997; Moreau, 
1998; Kinnunen, 1987) . Among the 774 MS patient s treated with amifampridine  included in 
the safety asses sment  of this report , 4 (0.5%) experienced seizures.  
Other clinically significant or S AEs reported in more than 1 adult  patient were palpitations 
(8/1,454; 0.56%), abnormal liver enzymes ( 6/1,454; 0.41%), QTc prolongation (2/ 1,454; 
0.14%), and premature ventricular contraction/increased ventricular extrasystoles (2/ 1,454; 
0.14%). Each of the following serious or clinically significant events was reported in a single 
patient: chorea, paresthesias, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, dr ug-
induced hepatitis , gastroesophageal reflux, increased lipase and amylase, aspiration 
pneumonia with confusion, and urinary t ract infection with confusion. 
Based upon the previous clinical studies involving the use of amifampridine in the treatment 
of La mbert -Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), there have been reports of provocation of 
bronchial asthma, respiratory failure, or respiratory disorder.  These events are also part of 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5 Page 31

CMS symptoms; however, the risk may be more likely when the patient has asthma or 
respiratory disorder as a comorbidity with CMS. 
8.5 Overall Risks and Benefits  
Data on amifampridine treatment in 1,454 patients or healthy volunteers support the 
favorable safety profile of amifampridine (both base and phosphate formulations) at doses up 
to 80 mg per day. Current data demonstrate that amifampridine phosphate salt has an 
acceptable tolerability profile with a positive risk -benefit in patients treated with 
amifampridine.   
Risks of of study involvement have been minimized by:  
1. Patients enter ing the study may already be on some formulation of 3,4-
diaminopyridine and have demonstrated tolerability or;  
2. Patients naïve to the medication are titrated to a tolerable and effective dose with 
open -label medication, under the observation of the Investigator.  Thus, the 
development of adverse events or lack of efficacy is monitored by the Investigator 
during t he step -wise titration and study medication dose can be reduced or 
discontinued at any point in the titration for either safety or lack of efficacy.   
The pharmacokinetic half -life of amifampridine phosphate is short (1.8 hours), 
therefore discontinuation of medication will qickly terminate the effects, and mitigate 
adverse reactions.  
This is a withdrawal study design looking at patient worsening on placebo; which is 
possible due to the short half -life of amifampridine phosphate. Therefore, patients must 
demonstrate a level of efficacy during the open -label titration period.  This further 
reduces patient risk, by not continuing an experimental medication in patients who fail 
to demonstrate a benefit.  
During the placebo withdrawal period, patients who deter iorate to a point that the 
Investigator assess to be lower than their baseline, open -label amifampridine phosphate 
is provided as to rescue the patient.  
Refer to the Firdapse Investigator Brochure ( February, 2015)  for further information on 
benefit/risk o f amifampridine.

8.6 Study Rationale  
Clinical trials, case series, and case reports studying the efficacy of 3,4 -DAP in  patients  with 
CMS have shown clinical benefit as described above in Section 8.4.2. Little controlled data 
are reported , and s everal of the se studies had patient s without genetic confirmation of CMS 
and lacked sensitive , objec tive, motor and electrophysiologic outcome measu res to study 
efficacy . In light of above mentioned advancements in field of genetics, electrophysiological 
techniques, and motor function measures, a randomized placebo- control led trial of  3,4-DAP 
in CMS patients is warranted . Thus, the purpose of this study ( CMS -001) is to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of amifampridine phosphate  in patients  diagnosed with subtypes of CMS.  
9 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
9.1 Primary  Objective s 
The primary objective s of the study are: 
• To characterize the overall safety and tolerability of amifampridine phosphate  
compared with placebo in patients with CMS; and  
• To assess the clinical efficacy of amifampridine phosphate  compared with placebo in 
patients with CMS , based on improvement in subject global impression (SGI) and 
motor function measur e (MFM 20  or 32) scores . 
10 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
10.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo -controlled, outpatient  two-period two-
treatment crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of amifampridine 
phosphate  in patients ( 2 years of age  and above ) diagnosed with CMS . The study is planned 
to be conducted at up to 5 site s in the United States and 2 sites in Canada , to include 
approximately 23 male and female patients. The planned duration of par ticipation for each 
patient is  approximately 56  days  excluding the screening period, which can last up to 
14 days.   
All patients ( parent or legal guardian ) who  sign an informed consent  will be screened for 
eligibility to participate in the study, including: inclusion and exclusion criteria; medical and 
medication history; complete physical exam; standard 12- lead ECG; laboratory testing; 
serum pregnancy testing (females of childbearing potential only ; result must be  negative to 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5 Page 33

proceed into the run- in period with open- label IP administration ); and CMS genetic testing 
(if not previously done or available) .  
Those patients successfully completing initial screening will have procedures/assessments 
(see Table 3 ) conducted on Day  1 of the run -in period. Those not previously on 3,4- DAP  or 
amifampridine phosphate  will then embark on an open label up- titration of amifampridine 
phosphate dose based upon clinical benefit (assessed at clinic visit and telephone solicitation)  
for up to 4 weeks  during run- in period, until  stable dose and frequency of amifampridine 
phosphate is achieved  for 7  days . If these patients have demonstrable increase of MFM  20 or 
MFM  32 scores of  >20% during this period of open label uptitration of dose, patients will 
then be randomized to a Treatment Sequence on last day of open -label run -in period ( Day 0 ).  
Patients already receiving 3,4 -DAP or amifampridine phosphate treatment for CMS, and 
meeting the applicable inclusion and exclusion criteria are eligible to participate in this study. 
The patient should report or investigator judges there is a history of meaningful improvement 
in motor function on 3,4- DAP or amifampridine phosphate treatment; improvement of at 
least 20% in MFM 20 or 32 is not a requirement for these participants. Patients who are on a 
stable dose of amifampridine phosphate with a history of meaningful improvement in mo tor 
function, they  can be randomized into Period 1. The patient should be on that stable dose and 
frequence of amifampridine phosphate for at least 1 week before being randomized to a 
Treatment Sequence. T hose patients who are on a stable dose of 3,4- DAP  will be transitioned 
to equivalent dose of amifampridine phosphate for 7 days prior to randomization to 
treatment.    
Procedures/assessments, as detailed in Table 3 , will be conducted before  starting Period 1 
study medication (i.e. Day 0). Administration of Period 1 study medication (amifampridine 
phosphate  or placebo)  begins after all assessments have been completed on Day 0. Every 
attempt should be made to have the same individual perform all assessments for a patient 
throughout the study , and after the same dos e used for Day 0 assessments. Following P eriod 
1, patients will be returned to the same stable do se administered at the end of the open -label 
run-in period for days 9 -21, followed by Period 2 dosing for 8 days.  Patients who were on a 
stable does of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful improvement prior to 
randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose from days 9 -21, 
followed by Period 2 dosing for 8 days. After completion of of  the study, patients will be 
eligible for expanded access program and receive open -label amifampridine phosphate at the 
same dose and frequency as established in the run- in phase of the study. Patients who were 
on stable dose of amifampriding phosphate wit h a history of meaningful improvement prior 
to randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose and frequency during 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5 Page 34

their participation in the expanded access program.   
Following successful completion of the Run- in and randomization on Day  0, study visits will 
occur on Day  8 (+1  day) , Day  21 (+1 day) , and Day 29 (+1  day)  or, if applicable, e arly 
discontinuation from the study . Note that should a shift in days occur (i.e. +1 day), then rest 
of schedule must shift to keep sequence and stabilization periods constant. 
Safety and efficacy assessments will be made throughout the study as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments in Table 3  and Section 13 . 
Open -label Run -in 
Amifampridine phosphate  dosing will start on Day  1 of the Open- label Run -in and may be 
titrated upward every 3 to 4 days, per the dosing guidelines in Table 4 , at the discretion of the 
investigator , for up to 4 weeks, with 1 week of stable dose and frequency before being 
randomized to a Treatment Sequence. Measurements of clini cal improvement will be 
administered during th e final period of dosing stability . Dosing can be increased or decreased 
by the  investigator during the run -in phase  prior to the last week of stable dosing . 
Randomization can only occur after the patient has been on a stable dose for at least 7 days . 
For patients naïve to 3,4- DAP  or amifampridine phosphate , a second screening event prior to 
randomization requires a t least a 20% interval improvement  in M FM 20 or 32 ( scale use 
depends  upon the age of patient) , compared to Day  1 of the run- in period, to be eligible for 
randomization. 
Patients already  receiving amifampridine phosphate tr eatment for CMS meeting the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria are eligible to participate in this study. They must have a medical 
history showing improvement on amifampridine phosphate treatment; improvement of at 
least 20% in MFM 20 or 32 is not a requirement for these participants.  They  can be 
randomized into Period 1 if on stable dose and frequency for 1 week before being 
random ized to a Treatment Sequence.  
Those patients who are on a stable dose of 3,4 -DAP with a history of  meaningful 
improvement will be transitioned to equivalent dose of amifampridine phosphate for 7 days 
prior to randomization to treatment.  Improvement of at least 20% in MFM 20 or 32 is not a 
requirement for these participants.

Treatment Group A or B  
Perio d 1 (Day s 1-8) (+1 day)  
Patients who successfully complete the open -label run- in and continue to meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1  ratio) on the last day of the run- in period 
(Day  0) to either Sequence 1 or 2. Subjects randomized to Sequence 1 will receive Treatment 
A (amifampridine phosphate  or placebo) in Period 1  and Treatment B ( the other treatment) in 
Period 2. Subjects randomized to Sequence 2 will receive Treatment B ( amifampridine or 
placebo) in Period 1 and Treatment A ( the other treatment ) in Period 2. Study medication 
(amifampridine phosphate  tablets or placebo tablets)  for Period 1 will be dispensed on Day  0, 
the last day of the Run- in, by the site pharmacist, according to the randomization schedule.  
The administration  of blinded  medication will begin only after completi on of  all 
assessments of Day 0. The Day 0 assessments are performed while taking a dose of 
open -label amifampridine phosphate in the clinic, 40 minutes before star ting the 
assessment s.   Any supply of open- label amifampridine phosphate should be collected by the 
study site and stored before dispensing the Period 1 blinded medication.   
The patient will receive either blinded amifampridine phosphate tablets or placebo tablets for 
8 days  as an outpatient, and a dose of the same medication on the day of scheduled study 
visit ( Day 8 ) in the clinic, in order to facilitate efficacy assessments, under double -blind 
conditions. If the patient is on a BID or TID regimen during Period 1, the Day 8  assessments 
should occur after the same dose that corresponds to when assessments were done on Day 0.  
All unused medication and the container must be brought back to the study site at the end of 
Period 1. The Day 8 medication is the same as double -blind medication taken for the 
previous Period 1 days. Any unused portion of dispensed drug will be returned to the 
pharmacy before dispensing drug for the Re -Stabilization Period.  A dose of m edication for 
Day 8 must be administered by research study staff , in the clinic, in order  to perform 
evaluations within specified time periods , as described in Section 10.3.3. 
Re-stabilization  Period  (Days 9- 21) (+1 day)  
After Day 8 in -clinic evaluations, p atients will return to open- label study drug , through Day 
21 (same dose and frequency  as at the end of run- in), as prescribed by i nvestigator and 
dispensed by research pharmacist . No dose adjustments may occur. Patients who were on 
stable dose of amifampriding phosphate with history of meaningful improvement prior to 
randomization in CMS -001, will be returned to the same stable dose and frequency during 
the re- stabilization period.  
 CMS -001

Period 2 (Days 22- 29) (+1 day)  
Study medication will be dispensed by the site pharmacist on the last day of the Stabilization 
Period (i.e. Day  21), according to the randomization schedule. Patients will start the 
blinded study medication only after completi on of all  of the Day 22 assess ments, while 
taking open -label medication , 40 minutes  before starting assessments . 
Per the crossover design, patients will receive  the double -blind study  medication ( either 
amifampridine phosphate  tablets or placebo tablets ) during Period 2, for 8 days (Day 22 – 29 ) 
as an outpatient with a  dose of the same medication on the day of scheduled study visit ( Day 
29), administered by study personnel  in the clinic , to facilitate efficacy assessments, under 
double -blind conditions. If the patient is on a BID or TID reg imen during P eriod 2, the Day 
29 assessments should occur after the same dos e that corresponds to when assessments were 
done on Day 0. Any unused portion of dispensed drug will be returned to the site before 
enrolling the patient in the expanded acc ess ptogram and dispensing open -label drug .

Version Amendment 5  Page 43  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
Catalyst  must be notified of all patient withdrawals from th e study or from treatment with IP 
as soon as possible. Catalyst  also reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for 
either clinical or administrative reasons and to discontinue participation by an individual 
investigator or site for poor enrol lment or noncompliance.  
Reasons for which the investigator or Catalyst  may withdraw a patient from the study 
treatment include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Patient experiences a serious or intolerable AE;  
• Patient requires medica tion prohibited b y the protocol; or  
• Patient becomes pregnant (refer to Section  11.4 for details on the reporting 
procedures to follow in the event of pregnancy).  
Reasons for which the investigator or Catalyst  may withdraw a patient from the study 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Patient does not adhere to study require ments specified in the protocol;  
• Patient was erroneously admitted into the study or  does not meet inclusion criteria;  or 
• Patient is lost to follow -up. 
If a patient fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to 
determine the reason. If the patient cannot be reached by telephone, a certified letter should 
be sen t to the patient requesting contact with the investigator. This information should be 
recorded in the study records. 
The investigator or designee must explain to each patient  (parent/guardian) , before 
enrollment into the study, that for evaluation of study  results, the patient’s protected health 
information obtained during the study may be shared with Catalyst , regulatory agencies, and 
IRB/IEC/REB. It is the investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain written 
permission to use protected health i nformation, per country -specific regulations , from each 
patient. If permission to use protected health information is withdrawn, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to obtain a written request, to ensure that no further data will be collected from 
the patient and the patient will be removed from the study.  
10.2.4 Patient Identification  and Randomization  
Each patient will be assigned a unique patient identification number . Upon signing of the 
ICF, subjects will be assigned an ID composed of a two digit site num ber and a two digit 
subject number (e.g. site 1 subject 1 would be assigned 01 -01). Screen failures that are 
allowed to be re -screend will keep the same site assigned ID. There are no plans to replace 
subjects that drop out of the study.  
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 44  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
Randomization wil l be across sites to maintain the 1:1 ratio of drug:placebo assignment. The 
assignments to treatment ( amifampridine phosphate  or placebo) will be based on a computer -
generated randomization code. A central point of contact will be provided to the site 
pharmacist to obtain the treatment sequence for the subject to be enrolled in Period  1 on the 
last day of the run- in period (Day  0). 
10.2.5 Re-screening  
Re-screening of screen failures will be allowed, if re -screening is approved by the Medical 
Monitor. Justification  of the reason for re -screening must be clearly stated in the patient’s 
source documentation. No new consent would be required if re -screened within 30 days.  
10.3 Treatments  
10.3.1 Treatments Administered

10.3.2.1 Product Characteristics and Labeling  
Drug product is formulated as a phosphate salt of amifampridine. Tablets were developed to 
provide the equivalent of 10 mg of amifampridine base for oral administration. Each tablet 
contains amifampridine phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, and 
calcium stearate. The bottles of tablets are labeled “Amifampridine phosphate  Tablets, 
10 mg .” 
The tab lets are to be dispensed by the site pharmacy departm ent into suitably sized pharmacy 
bottles  for patient  use. Placebo will be provided as tablets indistinguishable from 
amifampridine phosphate . The amifampridine phosphate  tablets and placebo tablets will be 
clearly labeled and the pharmacist is responsible for dispensing the amifampridine phosphate  
tablets or placebo tablets, as needed, for each patient. 
Each bottle will be labeled to include the compound name , site number, patient ID number, 
date dispensed , storage instructions, the statement ‘Caution – New  Drug – Limited by 
Federal law to investigational use ,’ trial number, manufacturer name and address, and area 
for instructions for use.  
10.3.2.2 Storage  
At the study site, all IP must be stored at room temperature ( 20-25 degrees Celsius ) and in  a 
secure area accessible only to the designated pharmacist and clinical site personnel. All IP 
must be stored and inventoried, and the inventories must be carefully and accurately 
documented according to applicable national and local regulations, ICH GCP, and study 
procedures.  
10.3.3 Directions for Administration  
All doses of study treatment will be taken at home , except during the in- clinic study visit. If 
the patient takes the IP two or more times a day , then the patient should be given specific

Titration during the run-in phase will be at investigator ’s discretion per guidelines in Table 4 . 
The i nvestigator may contact the patient every 3 to 4 days to evaluate clinical improvement 
and determine if an adjustment of study dose  is needed . During double -blind, placebo-
controlled tr eatment, r escue dose amifampridine phosphate  will be available in case of 
worsening symptoms to a level that is worse than their baseline, prior to treatment. The Chief 
Medical Officer needs to be contacted to discuss breaking the blind.  
10.3.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
Patients will be randomized  on the last day of the open- label run -in period (Day  0) to either 
Treatment Sequence 1 or 2, in a 1:1 ratio . Based upon the Treatment Sequence assigned, 
patients will receive either amifampridine phosphate or placebo in Period 1 and the other 
treatment in Period 2 . A stabilization period using open- label amifampridine phosphate  will 
occur between switches of amifampridine phosphate  and placebo. IP will be administered 
under double -blind conditions  for each Sequence.  
The randomization code will be provided by Catalyst  or designee to the site Pharmacist.  
Details will be included in the Pharmacy Manual .

10.3.5 Selection of Doses Used in the Study  
The amifampridine phosphate  dose is 10 mg  to 80  mg total daily dose, given in 2 to 4 divided 
doses, with no single dose > 15 mg in patients up to 16 years of age or > 20 mg in patients 
>16 years of age . Safety of a single maxim um dose of 20 mg is based on completed animal 
and in vitro  pharmacology , PK, a nd toxicology studies . 
10.3.6 Blinding  
This is a double -blind study where both the patients  (parent/guardian/caregiver)  and 
investigator will be blinded to treatment assignment. 
10.3.7 Treatment Compliance  
Patients will be instructed to return all IP containers and remaining study medication at each 
study visit. Patient compliance with the dosing regimen will be assessed by reconciliation of 
the used and unused IP. The quantity dispensed, returned, used, lost, etc., must be recorded 
on the medication dispensing log provi ded for the study.  
10.3.8 Inves tigational Product Accountability 
The study site pharmacy  is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including dates and 
quantities) of IP(s) received, patients to whom IP is dispensed (patient -by-patient dose 
specific accounting), IP returned, and IP lost or destroyed. The investigator,  study  site 
pharmac y or designee must retain all unused or expired study supplies until the study monitor 
(on-site CRA) has confirmed the accountability data.  
10.3.9 Return and Disposition  of Clinical Supplies  
Unused IP must be kept in a secure location for accountability and recon ciliation by the study 
monitor. The investigator or designee must provide an explanation for any destroyed or 
missing IP or study materials.  
Unused IP may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard operating procedures, but only 
after Catalyst  has grant ed approval for drug destruction. The monitor must account for all IP 
in a formal reconciliation process prior to IP destruction. All IP destroyed on site must be 
documented. Documentation must be provided to Catalyst  and retained in the investigator 
study  files. If a site is unable to destroy IP appropriately, the site can return unused IP to 
Catalyst  upon request. The return of IP or IP materials must be accounted for on a Study 
Drug Return Form provided by Catalyst . 
All IP and related materials should be  stored, inventoried, reconciled, and destroyed or 
returned according to applicable regulations and study procedures.

10.7 Efficacy Variable s 
The timing of required evaluation is described in the Schedule of Events in Table 3  according 
to the sequence listed below.  
Assessment  Start Time  
After Dose * 
(± 10 minutes unless 
otherwise specified)  
SGI 40 min utes 
MFM 20  or 32  after SGI  
Stimulated Single  fiber EMG  after MFM  
Slurp test, CGI-S and CGI-I At end of assessments  
  *Administration of medication represents Time 0 (minutes)  
If the stimulated single fiber EMG (optional assessment) is not to be performed, then the 
slurp test (also optional), CGI -S and CGI -I assessments should be done following completion 
of the MFM .   
10.7.1 Subject  Global  Impression  
The SGI (Farrar, 2001)  is a 7 -point scale on which the patient rates their global impression of 
the effects of a study treatment (1 = terrible to 7 = delighted).  The SGI will be assessed by 
the patient  or the patient’s  parent /guardian/ caregiver  if the patient  is unable to complete  the 
SGI. The SGI has demonstrated concordance with the physician’s assessment of 
improvement (Dodick, 2007) . Instructions for the SGI are provided in Appendix 1 and the 
CMS-001 Study Reference Manual.  
10.7.2 Motor Functi on Measure  
The standard MFM 32 (Bérard, 2005)  evaluates the severity and progression of motor 
function and is applicable to all degrees of disease severity, in both ambulant and 
nonambulant patients. It is not, however, well suited as an outcome measure in young 
children because of the time required to complete the MFM and difficulty in completion in 
terms of childrens’  cognitive and motor development. A short -form (MFM 20) (de Lattre, 
2013)  will be used in this study  for patients 2 years up to 7 years  of age , with each of 20 
items scored on a 4 -point Likert scale (based on patient’s best abilities without assistance): 
standing and transfers (8 items); axial and proximal motor function (8 items); and distal 
motor function (4 items). Total MFM 20 score ranges from 0 to 60. The MSM 32 will be 
used for patients 7 years  of age and older, with each of 32 items scored on a 4- point Likert 
 CMS -001

Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
scale (based on patient’s best abilities without assistance) : standing and transfers (13  items), 
axial and proximal motor function (12 items), and distal motor function ( 7 items). Total 
MFM  32 score ranges from 0 to 96. Higher MFM 20 or 32 scores indicate more functional 
improvement. 
MFM 20  or 32 will be administered at the protocol specified time points by the same well 
trained evaluator throughout the study. Instructions  for conducting the MFM 20 and MFM  32 
are provided in Appendix  2 and Appendix  3, respectively, and in the CMS -001 Study 
Reference Manual.  
10.7.3 Clinical Global  Impression  Scales  
The CGI score is a 2 -part observer -rated instrument that assesses 1) severity of the patient’s 
disease (CGI -S) at a given point in time and 2) change from baseline (CGI -I). This 
instrument is widely used and well validated ( Busner, 2009) . The investigator will complete 
the 7 -point CGI -S based on his/her experience of severity in the C MS population as a whole 
as the point of reference. Instructions for the CGI -S are contained in Appendix 4 and the 
CMS-001 Study Reference Manual.  
The CGI -I captures the investigator’s global impression of the patient’s improvement or 
worsening from baseline status. The 7- point scale is scored by the investigator based on 
changes in symptoms, behavior, and functional abilities. Instructions for the CGI -I are 
contained in Appendix 5 and the C MS-001 Study Reference Manual.  
10.7.4 Stimulated Single  Fiber Electromyogram  
Stimulated s ingle  fiber EMG is a method to assess the integrity of the neuromuscular 
junction. The principal of stimulated  single fiber EMG is to measure the time variability of 
the muscle fiber action potentials as they are generated by the discharges of the motor neuron 
(SFEMG using voluntary activation) versus the variability of a single muscle fiber potential 
(SFEMG us ing motor axonal stimulation). In infants, young children, or patients having 
difficulty in making a controlled activation, stimulated jitter analysis is preferable. From a 
technical standpoint, facial muscles such as the frontalis and orbicularis oculi are t he easiest 
to record by stimulating the distal branch of the facial nerve supplying them with  a 
monopolar needle electrode. The latter has less associated stimulation artifact and better 
contr ol of the stimulating impulse. Since the recordings are made wit h a disposable 
concentric needle electrode, the term “jitter analysis” is preferred as being semantically more 
correct than single fiber EMG. Stimulated jitter analysis will be performed by a certified 
electromyographer. Local anesthetic agent will be appl ied to the site of needle electrode

examination 30 minutes before the procedure. Not all patients can tolerate the procedure so 
this test is optional.  
10.7.5 Slurp Test  
Patient’s with neuromuscular disorders experience increasing weakness of bulbar -innervated 
muscles that may result in aspiration or catastrophic airway compromise. The “ Slurp ” test is 
a non- invasive way of assess ing bulbar function (Hudspeth 2006) , particularly in children. 
Four ounces (120 mL) of water is placed in a cup. The patient  is instructed to drink the entire 
contents of the cup through a standard flex straw as quickly as possible, making a loud 
slurping sound at the end. The duration of time from the start of drinking the water to the 
slurp sound will be measured. This test i s optional . Slurp tests will be initiated during the up -
titration phase by parents or investigators until reliable performance is achieved, thereafter 
only at identified places in the protocol timeline.   
11 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable AE is any  untoward medical occurrence (e. g. sign, symptom, 
illness, disease or injury) in a patient administered the IP or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes:  
• AEs not previously observed in the  patient that emerge during the course of the study.  
• Pre-existing me dical conditions judged by the i nvestigator to have worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in character during the study.  
• Complications that occur as a result of non -drug protocol -imposed interventions .  
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE.  
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
The study  period during which all non- serious AEs will be reported begins after informed 
consent is obtained and the  first administration of study drug through the last visit ( Study 
Day 29) or at the early termination visit. After informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol -imposed interventions will be 
reported. The criteria for determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 11.2. 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 56  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
The investigator should follow all unresolved AEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, 
the patient is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or 
partici pation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be 
documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the patient’s medical record.  
The i nvestigator responsible for the care of the patient or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for se verity, relationship to IP, and seriousness ( refer to  Section 11.2 for SAE definition). 
Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not eq uivalent to seriousness, which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligat ions.  
The i nvestigator  will determine the severity of each AE using the following Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v 4 grades defined in  Table 7  (the event 
will be recorded on the source documents and AE CRF)  (Appendix 5) . Events that are 
CTCAE grades 4 and 5 are serious events and require complet ion of both an SAE form and 
AE CRF.  Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed 
according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below.  
Table 7. Categories of Severity for CTCAE Criteria  
Severity  Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms;  clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  Note: Grade 4 and 5 
adverse events should 
always be reported as 
serious adverse events  Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
** Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.

The investigator  will suggest the relationship of an AE to the IP and will record it on the 
source documents and AE CRF, using the relationship categories defined in  Table 8 . 
Table 8. Description of Relationship to Adverse Event Categories  
Relationship 
Category  Description  
Not Related  Exposure to the IP has not occurred  
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE 
are not reasonably related in time  
OR 
The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other 
than the use of the IP; that is, there are no facts [evidence] or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP.  
Possibly 
Related  The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE 
are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE could be explained equally well by factors or causes 
other than exposure to the IP.  
Probably 
Related  The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are 
reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE is more likely explained by exposure to the IP than 
by other factors or causes.  
 
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will  be assigned by the sponsor to the 
original terms entered in the e CRF, using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA) terminology.  
11.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria : 
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
• Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the patient at immediate risk 
of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death  
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 58  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
• Requires or prolongs in -patient hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, that is, an AE that occurs in the child or fetus 
of a patient  exposed to IP prior to conception or during pregnancy  
• Is an important medical event  or reaction .  
For this study, a generalized tonic- clonic convulsion/seizure is  to be considered an  SAE . 
The reporting period for SAE s begins after informed consent is obta ined and continues 
through 4 weeks after the last dose or at the early discontinuation visit.  
Any SAE, whether or not considered related to study drug, must be reported within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event by forwarding (fax, email)  the study -specifi c SAE Report Form to 
Catalyst.  As additional information becomes available, including but not limited to the 
outcome of the SAE and any medication or other therapeutic measures used to treat the 
event, it must be reported within 24 hours  to Catalyst.  
The i nvestigator should follow all unresolved S AEs until the events are resolved or 
stabilized, the patient is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be 
documented in the eCRF  and in the patient’s medical record.  
For some SAEs, Catalyst  may follow  up by telephone, fax, e mail, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report 
(e.g. hospital discharge summary, consultant report, autopsy report).  
At the last scheduled visit, the i nvestigator should instruct each patient to report any 
subsequent SAEs that the patient’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior 
study treatment.  
The i nvestigator should notify Catalyst  of any death or SAE occurring at any time after a 
patient has discontinued, or terminated study participation, if felt to be related to prior study 
treatment. Catalyst  should also be notified if the i nvest igator should become aware of the 
development of cancer, or of a congenital anomaly, in a subsequently conceived offspring of 
a patient that participated in this study.   
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB , IEC  or REB will be done in compliance with the standard 
operating procedures and policies of the IRB , IEC  or REB and with applicable regulatory 
requirements. Adequate documentation must be provided showing that the IRB  IEC or REB 
was properly and promptly notified as required.

11.3 Safety Blood Collection  
Patients who experience a serious or severe AE should have , at the discretion of the 
investigator, a blood sample  drawn for safety labs  as soon as possible after the AE . 
Additional blood sampling may be performed at any time during the study if warranted to 
monitor patient safety.  
11.4 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy in a patient  or partner should be reported within 24 hours  of the site becoming 
aware of the pregnancy  by fax or email  of the Pregnancy Reporting Form, in the study 
reference materials , to Catalyst . In addition, pregnancy in a patient  is also reported on the 
End of Study CRF. The investigator  must make every effort to follow the patient  through 
resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or termination) and to report the resolution on the 
follow -up form ( Pregnancy Rep orting Form : Additional Information) in the study reference 
materials. In the event of pregnancy in the partner of a study patient , the investigator  should 
make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s consent for release of protected hea lth 
information. 
11.5 Urgent Safety Measures  
The regulations governing clinical trials state that the sponsor and investigator are requi red to 
take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards 
that may affect the safety of su bjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be 
notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) 
Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the 
investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the 
subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the 
IRB/EC/REB  is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for urgent s afety measures is 
the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit. 
Investigators are required to report any urgent safety measures with in 24 hours. 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 60  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures  include discovery of the 
following:  
• An immediate need to revise IP administration (i. e. modified dose amount or 
frequency not defined in protocol).  
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management.  
• Discovery that the quality or s afety of IP does not meet established safety 
requirements.  
 
11.6 Medical Monitor Contact Information  
Contact information and additional requirements will be provided in the CMS -001 Study  
Reference Manual.  
The investigator is encouraged to discuss with the Medical M onitor any AEs for which the 
issue of seriousness is unclear or questioned. Contact information for the study  Medical 
Monitor is  listed below.

12 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS  
The measures of safety used in this study are routine clinical and laboratory procedures. The 
efficacy measures use a variety of approaches to evaluate changes in neuromuscul ar function 
and muscle strength . These standardized tests have been previously used for determination of 
response to therapeutic intervention in patients w ith MG and in other indications and, thus, are 
relevant for use in this study in patients with CMS .

15 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF  SAMPLE SIZE 
15.1 Determi nation of Sample Size  
Assuming a standardized between -treatment difference of 0.5, 23 patients per sequence will 
ensure power of 90% for the 2- sided test at the 0.05 level using the standard 2- by-2 crossover 
analysis.  
15.2 Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population (i.e. all patients who receive at 
least 1  dose of amifampridine phosphate or placebo). The safety analysis will be descriptive 
and will be presented on observed data only. All safety data, and corresponding Change 
From  Baseline (CFB) if appropriate, will be listed.  
15.3 Adverse Events  
All treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by the treatment at the 
time of onset. Counts and percentages will be presented by treatment for each observed 
system organ clas s (SOC) and preferred term (PT) as defined in MedDRA. Summaries by 
level of severity and relationship to treatment will be presented by treatment at the time of 
occurrence. Listings of all deaths, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AE will be provided. 
15.4 Laboratory Tests  
For each laboratory parameter, descriptive statistics will be presented for the observed value 
and CFB by treatment at the time of the assessment. The frequency and percentage of 
patients who experience abnormal (i.e. outside of reference rang es) laboratory values will be 
presented by treatment at the time of the assessment. Clinically significant abnormalities will 
be collected as AEs.  
15.5 Other Safety Assessments  
Summary statistics for vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG parameters will b e 
presented by treatment at the time of the assessment.  
15.6 Efficacy Analysis  
The following provides a summary of the planned statistical analyses. Details will be 
provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to 
unblinding. Any inconsistency between the SAP and the protocol will be noted in the SAP.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed for 2 datasets:  
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 69  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized patients who receive at 
least 1 dose of IP (amifampri dine phosphate or placebo) and have at least one post -treatment 
efficacy assessment.  
Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patients with 
major protocol deviations. 
If the PP Population is the same as the FAS, then the results will be presented only for the 
FAS. Exclusion from the FAS and PP Population will be finalized prior to database lock and 
subsequent unblinding.  
In addition to the following, summary statistics will be provided by treatment and period for 
CGI-I, CGI -S, Change From Baseline (CFB) for CGI -S, the optional Slurp Test, and 
variables associated with the optional SFEMG.  
15.7 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The analysis of CFB for SGI is the primary efficacy analysis and will be performed using the 
standard analys is for a 2 -by-2 crossover design. Summary statistics for SGI and CFB for SGI 
will be presented by treatment and period. P -values <0.05 wil be considered statistically 
significant.  
15.8 Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The total score for MFM and the subtotal for eac h of the three dimensions (Standing and 
transfer, Axial and proximal motor function, and Distal motor function) will be standardized 
by the possible maximum for both MFM 20 and MFM  32. The CFB for these standardized 
scores will be analyzed using the standa rd analysis for a 2 -by-2 crossover design for 
MFM  20 and MFM  32 separately and pooled, with the latter being the secondary and the 
separate analyses being supportive. The total scores, subtotals for each dimension, and the 
corresponding standardized scores  will be summarized by treatment and period for MFM 20 
and MFM 32 separately and standardized scores will be summarized by treatment and period 
for MFM 20 and MFM 32 pooled. P -values <0.05 wil be considered statistically significant.  
15.9 Changes in the Conduct  of the Study  
Any change in study conduct considered necessary by the investigator will be made only 
after consultation with Catalyst , who will then issue a formal protocol amendment to 
implement the change. The only exception is when an investigator cons iders that a patient’s 
safety is compromised without immediate action. In these circumstances, immediate approval 
of the chairman of the IRB/IEC/REB must be sought, and the investigator should inform 
Catalyst  and the full IRB/IEC/REB within 2  working days after the emergency occurs.  
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 70  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
16 COMPENSATION, INSURANCE, AND INDEMNITY 
There will be no charge to study patients to be in this study. Catalyst  will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study  (as included in the site budget) . In 
addition, after IRB/IEC/REB approval, Catalyst  may reimburse the cost of travel for study -
related visits. Catalyst  will not pay for any hospitalizations, tests, or treatments for medical 
problems of any sort, whether or not related to the study patient ’s disease that  are not part of 
this study. Costs associated with hospitalizations, tests, and treatments should be billed and 
collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected.  
The investigator should contact Catalyst  immediately upon notification that a study patient 
has been injured by the IP or by procedures performed as part of the study. Any patient who 
experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by the investigator to seek medical 
treatment at a pre- specified medical i nstitution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The patient should be given the name of a person to contact to seek 
further information about, and assistance with, treatment for study -related injuries. The 
treating physic ian should bill the patient’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the patient has followed the investigator’s 
instructions, Catalyst  will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the 
injuries caused by the IP or study procedures, if these costs are not covered by health 
insurance or another third party that usually pays these costs. In some jurisdictions, Catalyst  
is obligated by law to pay for study -related injuries without prior recourse to third party 
payer billing. If this is the case, Catalyst  will comply with the law.  
17 CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
The CRO data management department or designees will perform all data management 
activities, including the writing of a data management plan outlining the systems and 
procedures to be used.  
Study data on will be cap tured on CRFs and will be verified to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and patient records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Patients must also allow access to 
their medical records, and patients will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement 
when giving informed consent. The investigator must review and sign the completed CRF 
casebook to verify its accuracy.

18 STUDY MONITORING AND AUDITING  
Qualified individuals approved and/or designated by Catalyst  will monitor all aspects of th e 
study according to GCP and SOPs for compliance with applicable government regulations. 
The investigator agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the clinical supplies, 
dispensing, and storage areas and to the clinical files, including original medical records, of 
the study patients, and, if  requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The investigator and staff 
are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site 
visits conducted by Catalyst  or its designees.   
Members of Catalyst ’s GCP Quality  Department or designees may conduct an audit of a 
clinical site at any time before, during, or after completion of the study. The investigator will 
be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. 
Representatives of the FDA or other regulatory agencies may also conduct an audit of the 
study. If informed of such an inspection, the investigator should notify Catalyst  immediately. 
The investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site 
facilities, original source documentation, and all study files.  
19 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
The investigator must retain all study records required by Catalyst  and by the applicable 
regulations in a secure and safe facility. The investigator must consult a Catalyst  
representative before disposal of any study records, and must notify Catalyst  of any change 
in the location, disposition or custody of the study files. The investigator/institution must take 
measures to prevent acciden tal or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, 
documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and 
the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of study records (e .g. patient charts) 
as well as any original source documents that are electronic as required by applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
All study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or (2) at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The investigator/institution should retain 
patient identifiers for at least 15 years  after the completion or discontinuation of the study. 
Patient files and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time permitted by 
the hospital, institution or private practice, but not less than 15 years. These documents 
should be retaine d for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 72  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
requirements or by a Catalyst  agreement. Catalyst  must be notified and will assist with 
retention should investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of patient files for 
the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of Catalyst  to inform the investigator /institution as to 
when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
20 USE OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICATION 
Catalyst  recognizes the importance of communicating medical study  data and therefore 
encourages their publication in reputable scientific journals and at seminars or conferences. 
The details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and 
presentations based on the data from this study will be desc ribed in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement between Catalyst  and the institution of the investigator.

Appendix  2 Motor Function Measure (MFM 32 or 20)  
The MFM 32 will be used to evaluate the s everity and progression of motor function in 
patients 7 years of age and older. For patients 2 years up to 6 years of age, t he MFM 20 will 
be used to evaluate the severity and progression of motor function .   The MFM 32 or 20 
(depending on age) will be administered at the protocol specified time points (see Table 3 ) by 
the same well trained evaluator throughout the study .  
Each of the  32 items listed below will be graded using a 4 -point Likert scale based on the 
patient’s best abilities without any assistance:  
0 Cannot initiate the task  
1 Partially performs the task  
2 Performs the movement incompletely, or completely  but imperfectly (comp ensatory 
movements, position maintained for an insufficient duration of time, slowness,        
uncontrolled movement)  
3 Performs the task fully and “normally”; the movement is controlled, mastered, 
directed, and performed at constant speed  
 
The 20 motor function measures comprising the MFM20 are marked with   (child <7 years 
old) 
Total score ranges from 0 to 96 when summing the 32 items and from 0 to 60 when summing

All doses of study treatment will be taken at home, except during the in -clinic study visit. If 
the patient takes  the IP two or more times a day, then the patient should be given specific 
instructions on dosing relative to the time of their clinic visit to assure a dose will be given 
during the in- clinic visit. A dose must be administered in the clinic in order to fa cilitate 
efficacy assessments. All safety assessments (vital signs, laboratory tests) are to be 
performed before the dose administered to the patient during the scheduled in -clinic visit. 
All efficacy assessments will be performed at standardized times rel ative to the dose

15.1 Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a standardized between- treatment difference of 0.5, 23 patients per sequence 
will ensure power of 90% for the 2 -sided test at the 0.05 level using the standard 2 -by-2 
crossover analysis.  
15.2 Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population (i.e. all patients who receive 
at least 1  dose of amifampridine phosphate or placebo). The safety analysis will be 
descriptive and will be presented on observed data only. All safety data, and 
corresponding Change From Baseline (CFB) if appropriate, will be listed.  
15.3 Adverse Events  
All treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by the treatment 
at the time of onset. Counts and percentages will be presented by treatment for each 
 CMS -001

Summaries by level of severity and relationship to treatment will be presented by 
treatment at the time of occurrence. Listings of all deaths, SAEs, and discontinuations 
due to AE will be provided.  
15.4 Laboratory Tests  
For each laboratory parameter, descriptive statistics will  be presented for the observed 
value and CFB by treatment at the time of the assessment. The frequency and 
percentage of patients who experience abnormal (i.e. outside of reference ranges) 
laboratory values will be presented by treatment at the time of the assessment. 
Clinically significant abnormalities will be collected as AEs.  
15.5 Other Safety Assessments  
Summary statistics for vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG parameters will be 
presented by treatment at the time of the assessment.  
15.6 Efficacy Analysis  
The following provides a summary of the planned statistical analyses. Details will be 
provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to 
unblinding. Any inconsistency between the SAP and the protocol will be noted in the 
SAP.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed for 2 datasets:  
Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized patients who 
receive at least 1 dose of IP (amifampridine phosphate or placebo) and have at least one 
post-treatment efficacy assessment.  
Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patients 
with major protocol deviations.  
If the PP Population is the same as the FAS, then the results will be presented only for 
the FAS. Exclusio n from the FAS and PP Population will be finalized prior to database 
lock and subsequent unblinding.  
In addition to the following, summary statistics will be provided by treatment and 
period for CGI -I, CGI -S, Change From Baseline (CFB) for CGI -S, the optio nal Slurp 
Test, and variables associated with the optional SFEMG.  
15.7 Primary Efficacy Analysis

Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
The analysis of CFB for SGI is the primary efficacy analysis and will be performed 
using the standard analysis for a 2- by-2 crossover design. Summary statistic s for SGI 
and CFB for SGI will be presented by treatment and period. P -values <0.05 wil be 
considered statistically significant.  
15.8 Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The total score for MFM and the subtotal for each of the three dimensions (Standing 
and transf er, Axial and proximal motor function, and Distal motor function) will be 
standardized by the possible maximum for both MFM 20 and MFM  32. The CFB for 
these standardized scores will be analyzed using the standard analysis for a 2 -by-2 
crossover design for MFM  20 and MFM  32 separately and pooled, with the latter being 
the secondary and the separate analyses being supportive. The total scores, subtotals for 
each dimension, and the corresponding standardized scores will be summarized by 
treatment and period fo r MFM 20 and MFM 32 separately and standardized scores will 
be summarized by treatment and period for MFM 20 and MFM 32 pooled. P -values 
<0.05 wil be considered statistically significant.

Appendix 9: Protocol Amendment  4 
PURPOSE:  The purpose of this amendment is as follows:  
To formally remove the videotaping of patients from the protocol, clarify the start and stop 
times of Periods 1 and 2, blinded medication dosing, and remove the Day 36 visit.  The 
patient is either on a stable dose of amifampridine phosphate or has been titrated over a 
period of 4 weeks. Also, the patient is observed on open label medication for 2 weeks during 
the restabilization period.  Therefore, the Day 36 visit on open label medication adds no new 
information to  the efficacy or safety profile of amifampridine phosphate and the patient may 
go directly into the expanded access program.  
Risk : these administrative changes provide clarity, adding no additional risk to the patient.

Appendix 10: Protocol Amendment  5 
PURPOSE:  The purpose of this amendment is as follows:  
To formally remove the videotaping of patients from the protocol, clarify the start and stop 
times of Periods 1 and 2, blinded medication dosing, and remove the Day 36 visit.  The 
patient is either on a stable dose of amifampridine phosphate or has been titrated over a 
period of 4 weeks. Also, the patient is observed on open label medication for 2 weeks du ring 
the restabilization period.  Therefore, the Day 36 visit on open label medication adds no new 
information to the efficacy or safety profile of amifampridine phosphate and the patient may 
go directly into the expanded access program.  
Risk : these administrative changes provide clarity, adding no additional risk to the patient.

On Page 32, under 8.4.4 Safety of Amifampridine and Amifampridine Phosphate , added text  
Based upon the previous clinical studies involving the use of amifampridine in the 
treatment of Lambert -Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), there have been reports of 
provocation of bronchial asthma, respiratory failure, or respiratory disorder.  These events 
are also part of CMS symptoms; however, the risk may be more likely when the patient has 
asthm a or respiratory disorder as a comorbidity with CMS.  
On Page 33, under 8.5 Overall Risks and Benefits , added and deleted text  
Risks of of study involvement have been minimized by:  
1. Patients entering the study may already be on some formulation of 3,4- diaminopyridine 
and have demonstrated tolerability or;  
2. Patients naïve to the medication are titrated to a tolerable and effective dose with open -
label medication, under the observation of the Investigator.  Thus, the development of 
adverse events or lack of efficacy is monitored by the Investigator during the step -wise 
 CMS -001 
Version Amendment 5  Page 123  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  26 June 2017  
titration and study medication dose can be reduced or discontinued at any point in the 
titration for either safety or lack of efficacy.   
The pharmacokinetic half -life of amifampridine phosphate is short (1.8 hours), therefore 
discontinuation of medication will qickly terminate the effects, and mitigate adverse 
reactions.  
This is a withdrawal study design looking at patient worsening on placebo; which is 
possible due to the short half -life o f amifampridine phosphate. Therefore, patients must 
demonstrate a level of efficacy during the open -label titration period.  This further reduces 
patient risk, by not continuing an experimental medication in patients who fail to 
demonstrate a benefit.  
During the placebo withdrawal period, patients who deteriorate to a point that the 
Investigator assess to be lower than their baseline, open -label amifampridine phosphate is 
provided as to rescue the patient.  
Refer to the Firdapse Investigator Brochure (Febr uary, 2015) for further discussion 
information  on benefit/risk of amifampridine.

The following medicinal products should be use with caution in patients taking 
amifampridine phosphate:  
Medicinal products known to cause cardiac QT prolongation  
Medicinal products known to lower epileptic threshold  
Medicinal products with atropinic effects  
The concomitant use of amifampridine phosphate and medicinal products with atropinic 
effects may reduce the effect of both active substances and should be taken into 
consideration. Medicinal products with atropinic effects include tricyclic anti- depressants, 
most H1 atropinic anti -histamines, anticholinergic, anti- Parkinson medici nal products, 
atropinic antispasmodics, disopyramide, phenothiazine neuroleptics and clozapine.  
Medicinal products with cholinergic effects  
The concomitant use of amifampridine phosphate and medicinal products with cholinergic

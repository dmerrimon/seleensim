2.  PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
Title of Study:  A Phase 2 Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel -Cohort 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of  Once -Daily 
Application of Topical VDA-1102 Ointment for 28 Days in Subjects with Actinic  Keratosis  
Study Center(s):  Approximately  6 sites in the US and 3 in Israel  
Study Duration: 11 months Phase s of D evelopment: Phase 2  
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective: To co mpare the reduction on Day 56 in the number of the actinic 
keratosis (AK) lesions in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving once -daily topical 5% or 
10% VDA- 1102 ointment for 28 days to the reduction in the number of AK lesions in 
subjects receiving placebo.  
Secondary Objectives : 
• To e valuate the systemic and local (skin) safety and tolerability of once -daily topical 
application of 5% or 10% VDA- 1102 ointment or placebo for 28 days in adult subj ects 
with AK. 
• To assess the systemic exposure of VDA- 1102 and jasmonic acid, its primary  
metabolite , at selected time points during  topical application of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 
ointment or placebo for 28 days in adult subjects with AK . 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• To compare the proportion of subjects receiving 28 days of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 who 
on Day 56 had complete clearance of AK lesions to subjects receiving placebo . 
• To compare the reduction on Day 84 in the number of the actinic keratosis (AK) lesions 
in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving once -daily topical 5% or 10% VDA -1102 
ointment fo r 28 days to the reduction in the number of AK lesions in subjects receiving 
placebo.  
Study Design :  
This Phase 2 clinical trial is a multi- center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
multiple -dose, parallel -cohort study involving the once -daily non- occluded, topical dermal 
application of the study drug (5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment, or placebo) for 28 days.   
Approximately 84 subjects will be enrolled in this study in order to obtain at least 75 evaluable 
subjects by the end of the trial. Fifteen (15)  of these subjects will constitute a Nested Phase 1b 
Safety S tudy Sub-Cohort, and a maximum of 18 of the  84 subjects will be included in a PK 
Study Sub-Cohort. T hese 2 su b-cohorts may overlap and are described below.  
To qualify for the study, subjects aged 18 (inclusive) or older must have signed informed 
consent and met the study enrollment criteria  that include having 4-8 discrete Grade 1 or 2 AK 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 4

lesions within a 25 cm2 area on the scalp or face ( “the Treatment Field ”). Subjects will be 
randomly assigned in a double -blind fashion to 1 of 3 parallel treatment cohorts ( 5%, o r 10% 
VDA-1102, or placebo, respectively) in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomized subject s will apply a  
single thin  application of the study drug to the ir Treatment Field for 28 days.  
This clinical trial will include 3 study periods.   
Screening Perio d (Day -21 through Day 1 Pre- Dose):  
During the Screening Visit  (up to 21 days pre -dose ) subjects who have given written informed 
consent will undergo safety assessments including medical and medication histories, adverse 
event ( AE) documentation, vital signs, limited physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, 
12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), dermatologic examination, and Treatment Field 
identification, as well as other qualifying procedures.  
At the Day 1 Pre -Dose Visit , eligible subjects will return to the investigative site for ba seline 
assessments as well as final eligibility screening . The 18 subjects enrolled in the PK Study Sub-
Cohort ( described below) will have a baseline blood sampling for PK analysis.  Subjects who 
continue to meet the enrollment crite ria will undergo randomization to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 
5% VDA-1102, 10% VDA-1102, or placebo .  
Three times during the Screening and Day 1 Pre- Dose Visits, subjects will be trained and tested 
in proper application of the study drug to the Treatment Field with the help o f a flexible plastic 
stencil  (“Treatment Field Template”) . Subjects unable to apply the study  drug properly will be 
excluded , unless they are accompanied by a dosing partner willing and able to properly dose the 
subject each evening.  
Treatment Period  (Day  1 Dosing through Day 28):  
During the Day 1 Dosing Visit , randomized subjects (or their dosing partner) will apply the first 
dose of the study drug under the supervision of the site personnel in order  to further assure 
proper application.  
From Day 1  through Day 27, subjects will continue dosing the study drug to their respective 
Treatment F ields each evening while at home. Subjects will visit their respective investigative 
sites on Day 7 and Day 14 for safety and efficacy assessments , drug accountability, and re -
training in proper application of the study drug.  In addition, subjects in the PK Study Sub-
Cohort will undergo a single blood sampling at approximately 12 h  after the prior evening's 
dose. On the Day 28 Visit , subjects will return to the clin ic for safety and efficacy assessments. 
Subjects in the PK Study Sub- Cohort will have timed blood samples taken at approximately 12 , 
15, 18 and 21 hours after their Day 27 evening dose and a 24-hour Holter monitor will be 
attached .  
During the Treatment Period, site personnel wi ll communicate  once- weekly with each subject in 
order to assure study drug compliance, review dosing instructions, and remind subjects of  their 
next study visit.   2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 5

Observation Period (Day 29 through 84): 
Subjects will visit their respective investigative site on Days 35 and 56 for efficacy and safety 
assessments.  On Day 84 subjects will return to the sites for their final efficacy  and safety 
assessments.  Subjects with continuing AEs  will be scheduled for  follow- up evaluation, as 
appropriate.  
Nested Phase 1b Safety Sub -Cohort:  The first 15  (PK and non- PK) subjects enrolled in the 
trial will undergo on Day 7 the safety examinations planned for all other subjects plus physical 
examination,  clinical laboratory and ECG assessments. Once all 15 subjects in this Nested 
Phase 1b Safety Sub-Cohort have completed t heir Day 7 Visit , safety data (including AEs, LSR 
scores, clinical laboratory results, and ECG data ) from Day 1 through Day 7 will be reviewed in 
a blinded fashion by a safety committee.  During this blinded interim safety review, enrolled 
subjects will continue dosing the study drug and study enrollment will remain open. 
PK Study Sub -Cohort :  Of the approximate 84 subjects to be enrolled i n this trial, a maximum 
of 18 subjects  at select sites will undergo blood sampling for PK analysis on Day 1 Pre -Dose as 
well as on Day s 7, 14, 28, and 35. In addition, the PK Study Sub-Cohort will undergo 24-hour 
cardiac Holter monitoring on  Day 28 . Subjec ts included in this Sub- Cohort may also be 
included in the Nested Phase 1b Safety Sub -Cohort if they are in one of the first 15 subjects  to 
be enrolled into the study. 
Number of Randomized Subjects (planned):   Approximately 84  (3x28) subjects will be 
randomized in order to complete  the study with at least  75 (3x25) subjects anticipated to be 
available for efficacy analysis .  
Maximum Time Subjects May Remain in the Study : Subjects may participate in this study 
for a maximum of approximately 117 days (21 Screening  Period  + 32 Treatment Period + 64 
Observation Period ) 
Study Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint :  Change from baseline in the number of AK lesions in the 
Treatment Field of each subject on Day 56. 
Safety Endpoints :  Assessment of AEs, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory 
parameters, Local Skin Reaction (LSR) Scores , and electrocar diograms.    
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints:   Assessment of  the systemic exposure of VDA -1102 and its 
primary metabolite jasmo nic acid at selected time points during topical application of 5% or 
10% VDA-1102 ointment for 28 days in adult subjects with AK. 
Exploratory Endpoints:  The percentage of subjects achieving complete clearance of AK 
lesions within the Treatment Field on Da y 56.

Day 84.  
Statistical Analyses:  
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be based on changes from baseline to Day 56 in AK lesions.  
Comparative analysis of the changes will be applied between each of the active groups versus 
the p lacebo group using the two- sample t -test or n on-pa rametric Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney r ank 
sum test for independent samples or Median test (as is appropriate). In the event that the number 
of baseline lesion s is different between the treatment groups, then relative changes (%) will be 
analyzed as well.  
The overall change and the trend of differences in the changes over time between the groups 
will be analyzed using  mixed-effect model for repeated measures. The model will include 
changes at any time, the fixed effect time and the interaction of treatment and time. The model 
will be adjusted for baseline measures and for other relevant covariates.  
Interim Efficacy Ana lysis (IEA)  
A single interim efficacy analysis will be conducted as soon as 50% of the subjects have 
completed their Day 56 Visit. The objective of the IEA is to evaluate the probability of 
achieving the prim ary efficacy endpoint at the conclusion of the study. The unblinded data for 
the interim analysis sub -set will be analyzed by an independent statistician.  
The result of the IEA will be a calculated effect size and t -value, which will be based on the 
difference in the change from baseline in the number of AK lesions for each of the active 
groups as compared to the placebo group. If baseline measure differs between the groups, then 
relative change (%) will be tested.  The total significance level of 5% was divided between the 
interim efficacy analysis (0.005) and the final analysis (0.045). The spending function 
calculation for alpha will be performed using the O 'Brien -Fleming methods . In case the 
distribution of the outcome variable does not approximate normality, the appropriate non -
parametric methods will be considered for the interim analysis.  
Safety Analysis  
The safety end point data will be summarized for the ITT population.  AEs will be categorized by Syst em Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Terms (PT) 
using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  version 19.1 or higher .  The incidence of AEs, as well as the 
intensity and relationship to study drug, will be summarized by treatment group.  Sa fety will 
also be assessed by evaluating findings of physica l examinations, vital signs, Local Skin 
Reaction S cores , clinical laboratory test results, 12 -lead ECG tracings, drug exposure, 
concomitant medications, and withdrawals/terminations.  Clinical and  laboratory data will be 
presented by dose group.  Continuous variables will be described as the mean, median, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values 
of n observations. Categorical data will be 
described with contingency tables including freque ncy and percent. These findings will be 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 7

5. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
5.1 Indication 
VDA-1102 is a small molecule new chemical entity (NCE) under development for the 
treatment of patients with actinic keratosis  (AK) .  
5.2 Actinic Keratosis and Current Approaches to Treatment  
Actinic keratosis (AK) is one of the most common dermatologic diagnoses and affects an 
estimated 58 million people in the United States. Estimated treatment costs in 2004 were $1.2 billion (Warino 2006). AK  is generally present as rough patches or papules with erythema 
and scaling on sun- exposed skin, predominantly in older individuals with fair skin 
(Fitzpatrick skin types I -III). The lesions are often asymptomatic, but they may itch or be 
tender to the touch. Histologically, AK is characterized by keratinocyte atypia in the deeper 
epidermis , with defective maturation of the superficial epidermis  (Cohen, 2010). T he most 
common reason for treatment is to prevent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). 
Although the risk of progression to invasive SCC for a specific lesion may be low, it is 
widely regarded that 60% to 97% of SCCs originate from AKs (Hurwitz 1995, Mittelbronn , 
1998). This estimate is supported  by considerable genetic analysis that demonstrates shared 
chromosomal abnorma lities and progressive changes in gene expression between AK and 
SCC (Kanjilal, 1995, Ortonne, 2002, Kanellou , 2008, Padilla , 2010). Consequently , AK is 
often referred to as cSCC in situ  (Heaphy , 2000, Oppel , 2004, Röwert -Huber, 2007) and is 
part of the continuum of transformation from normal skin to AK and cSCC ( Ziegler , 1994, 
Stockfleth , 2013).  
Since AK results from malignant processes in sun- exposed skin (mainly face, scalp, and 
extremities), it is often necessary to treat en tire fields and not only the individual lesions. 
Cryosurgery and laser -based therapies are less effective for this indication. C urrent ly the  
most common  topical drugs and treatments for field-treatments  of AK are 5-fluorourac il 
(5FU) , imiquimod cream, ingenol mebutate gel, photody namic therapy (PDT), and diclofenac 
sodium in hyaluronic acid (Chetty , 2015).  
5.3 Unmet Medical Need  
Current AK therapies are inadequate and pose significant challenges to public health. Nearly 
all field treatments  are associated with  painful severe local skin reactions  ranging from 
necrosis to inflammation  which reduce treatment compliance  (Shergill 2014) . Cryotherapy 
and surgery are used to treat a limited number of lesions. However, these may leave unsightly 
scars or hypopigmentation and patients often require repeat treatments.  
The limited tolerability of most current treatments greatly decreases the willingness of patients to be retreated. Diclofenac sodium is t he only drug available that is well tolerated . 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 17

However,  it requires daily application for prolonged periods , shares the contraindications and 
potential side effects of the non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drug, and its long- term efficacy 
is still unknown. Consequently, AK patients often elect to avoid treatment and seek medical 
help only after their lesions have become esthetically intolerable or have advanced to 
invasive cSCC tumors. .  
In contrast, VDA -1102 has the potential for a significantly more desirable benefit -risk ratio . 
The drug induces neither necrosis nor an inflammatory reaction. VDA -1102 would mitigate 
people ’s avoidance of treatment and the often required re -treatment  of their chronic, recurrent 
skin disease.   
5.4 Nonclinical Summary  
The two GLP toxicology studies were: 1) a 28-day repeated dose oral  toxicity study in rats 
with a re covery phase and toxico- kinetics, and 2) a 28-day topical dermal toxicity study in 
male and female minipigs with a recovery phase and toxico-kinetics.  
An MTD for the local application of VDA -1102 was not reached at the hig hest feasible 
concentration  tested (20%). As discussed below in Section 5.6.2, t he relative doses of VDA -
1102 fed to rats and applied to the skin of minipigs were much higher than the exposures in 
the proposed clinical study. Full details of the non- clinical studies performed to date are found in the accompanying 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.5 VDA-1102 Clinical Summary 
Study VDA -CP-01 (titled, “A Phase 1 Randomized, Double -Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, 
Dose -Escalation Study in Healthy Older -Adult Volunteers to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of a Single Topical Dermal Application of VDA -1102 
Ointme nt”) was recently completed and preliminary blinded data are available. Healthy 
female volunteers without reproductive potential and male volunteers, aged 35-70, were 
sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 consecutive treatment cohorts (5%, 10% or 20% VDA -1102 
ointment, respectively).  Five subjects were randomized in a double-blind fashion in each dose 
cohort with 4 subjects to receive active VDA -1102 ointment and 1 subject to receive matched 
placebo (0% VDA -1102; vehicle control).  A  total of 1 5 subjects were ran domized: 12 
subjects received active VDA -1102 and 3 received placebo.   
There were no deaths, serious adverse events, or early study discontinuations in this study.  
There were a total of 11 adverse events reported  (whose treatment assignment is still 
unknown) . All the AEs were mild, short -lived, and reversible.  There were no clinically 
significant changes in study drug application sites, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 18

laboratory results, ECGs, or Holter monitors for any individual subject at  any time point 
regardless of treatment.  
Plasma concentrations of VDA -1102 and its main metabolite, jasmonic acid were below the 
level of quantific ation  of the LC/MS/MS bioanalytical assay  (1 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, 
respectively) . 
Further details of the results of this trial are provided in the VDA -1102 Investigator’s 
brochure. 
There are currently no ongoing clinical trials in which VDA -1102 is being administered. 
5.6 Study Rationale 
5.6.1 Rationale for Study Design and Subject Population 
(i) Efficacy  
VDA- 1102 has shown relevant pharmacological effects  in vivo  in the UVB -induced SKH -1 
hairless mice  model of actinic keratosis and skin cancer. In this pre-clinical study, dermal 
application of VDA -1102 led to a significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in the number of lesions 
relative to vehicle , that was comparable to the reduction noted with the comparative control 
compound ingenol mebutate (Picato®) 0.05%. C linical effects were observed within a week 
or two of treatment initiation , although full clinical benefit was observed after 3 -4 weeks.  
In this clinical protocol, study drug will be applied once -daily for 28 days to the Treatment 
Field on the scalp or face subjects with AK. Approximately 84 male and female subjects aged 
18 or older with 4- 8 discrete Grade 1 and/or 2 AK l esions who sign informed consent and 
meet the study enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned in a double -blinded fashion to 1 
of 3 parallel treatment cohorts (5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment, or placebo) at a ratio of 
1:1:1. The primary endpoint of this study is reduction in the number of AK lesions in the 
Treatment Field on Day 56. 
(ii) Safety  
The results from the toxicology studies and the estimated safety margins indicate that daily 
dermal application of 250 mg of VDA -1102 ointment for 28 days at doses as high as 20% to 
an area of 25 cm2 do not pose an untoward risk for evaluation in the target patient population. 
Specifically, topical application once -daily for 28 days of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment to 
10% of the minipigs body surface area in the nonclinical  toxicology program resulted in no 
significant systemic safety findings and only mild, reversible skin findings.  
In the completed Phase 1a clinical trial (Section 5.5 above), no safety concerns were 
identified following a single -dose of approximately 250 mg of 5%, 10%, or 20% VDA -1102 
applied once to a 25 cm2 area on the forehead of healthy older -adult volunteers.  PK analysis 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 19

demonstrated that ther e were no detectable concentrations of VDA -1102 or its primary 
metabolite, jasmonic acid.  
In this study a lower dose of 200 mg of 5% or 10% VDA- 1102 ointment will be applied for 
28 days to an area of 25 cm2. Safety assessment s will be performed throughout the Phase 2a 
study. In addition, the first 15 subjects enrolled in the trial will be defined as a Nested Phase 
1b Safety Sub-Cohort. A vailable safety data (including AEs, LSR scores, clinical laboratory 
results, and ECG data ) from Day 1 through Day 7 from these 15 subjects will be reviewed in 
a blinded fashion by a safety committee consisting of 2 independent investigators (not 
involved in the evaluation of subjects in the study) and the Study Safety Monitor.  
(iii) Pharmacokinetics  
In preclinical PK s tudies, VDA -1102 was rapidly metabolized, form ing jasmonic acid as its 
inactive primary metabolite, regardless of the animal species or the route of administration. In 
all cases, the amount of JA in the blood equaled or exceeded the concentrations of VDA-1102 
in the blood.  In a 28 -day dermal toxicity study in male and female minipigs, 5%, 10% or 
20% of VDA -1102 ointment was applied once daily to 10% of the body surface area. Blood 
levels of VDA -1102 were essentially below the LLOQ on Day 1 and very low and highly 
variable on Day 28. Blood concentrations of the primary metabolite jasmonic acid on Day 1 were detected only in the 20% VDA -1102 ointment group On Day 28, blood levels of 
jasmonic acid were detected at all dose levels and were higher than that on D ay 1, likely 
related to slow transdermal absorption as it appeared that steady state levels were present on Day 28.  
In the completed Phase 1a clinical trial (Section 5.5 above), there were no detectable 
concentrations of VDA -1102 or its primary metabolite, jasmonic acid following a single -dose 
of approximately 250 mg of 5%, 10%, or 20% VDA -1102 that was applied once to a 25 cm
2 
area on the forehead of healthy older -adult volunteers.   
In the current study, approximately 84 subjects will be dosed once each evening for 28 days  
with approximately 200 mg of study drug. Eighteen subjects will be enrolled into a PK Study 
Sub-Cohort and will undergo plasma sampling on Days 7, 14, 28, and 35 for PK assessment . 
Holter monitoring will be performed for 24 hours on Day 28 in all  subjects enrolled in the 
PK Study Sub -Cohort so that relevant  ECGs  tracings corresponding to peak levels (if 
detected) of VDA -1102 and/or jasmonic acid may be extracted once the PK /exposure data are 
available.  
5.6.2 Dose and Posology Justification 
The doses to be evaluat ed in this clinical trial are approximately 200 mg of 0%, 5%, and 10% 
VDA- 1102 topical ointment, spread evenly (unoccluded) over a 25 cm2 area of skin  on the 
face or scalp of subjects with actinic keratosis .  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 20

Table 1  lists the mg/kg/day exposures in non- clinical toxicology studies as compared to the 
exposure planned in the proposed human trial. Data is presented as dose ratios rather than 
exposure ratios, because in vivo , trans -dermal absorption of VDA -1102 and its primary 
metabolite, jasmonic acid, appears to be minimal (minipig and human single doses) as 
determined with a sensitive bioanalytical assay.  
The relative doses of VDA -1102 fed to rats and applied to the skin of minipigs were much 
higher than the highest dose (10% VDA-1102) to be applied in this study (Table 1) .

Based upon the non -clinical toxicology data and the safety findings from the Phase 1 clinical 
trial, VDA-1102 will be advanced to Phase 2 development. The doses in this clinical trial 
(200 mg of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 once daily for 28 days) are well  below the nonclinical 
systemic HED NOEAL lev els determined in both rats and minipig s. Furthermore, t he daily 
dose proposed (~200 mg) is below the ~250 mg single dose administered in the Phase 1 
clinical trial in  healthy older -adult volunteers in order to more closely approximate the 200 
mg dose administered in the non- clinical toxicology studies and to reduce the local and 
systemic exposures in humans.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 22

6. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective: To co mpare the reduction on Day 56 in the number of the actinic 
keratosis (AK) lesions in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving once -daily topical  5% 
or 10% VDA -1102 ointment for 28 days to the reduction in the number of AK lesions in 
subjects receiving placebo.  
Secondary Objectives : 
• To evaluate the systemic and local (skin) safety and tolerability of once -daily topical 
application of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment or placebo for 28 days in adult 
subjects with AK.  
• To assess the systemic exposure of VDA -1102 and jasmonic acid, its primary 
metabolite, at selected time points during  topical application of 5% or 10% VDA-1102 
ointment or placebo for 28 days in adult subjects with AK . 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• To compare the proportion of subjects receiving 28 days of 5% or 10% VDA -1102 
who on Day 56 had complete clearance of AK l esions t o subjects receiving placebo . 
• To compare the reduction on Day 84 in the number of the actinic keratosis (AK) 
lesions in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving once- daily topical 5% or 10% 
VDA- 1102 ointment for 28 days to the reduction in the number of A K lesions in 
subjects receiving placebo.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 23

7. STUDY DES CRIPTION 
7.1 Study Design  – Study Periods, Days, and Visits  
Approximately 84 subjects , aged 18 or older, who sign informed consent and meet the study 
enrollment criteria, will be randomized  to 1 of 3 parallel  treatment cohorts (5% or 10% VDA -
1102 ointment, or placebo ) in a 1:1:1 ratio . The clinical trial will include 3 study periods  
(Figure 1 and Table 4). 
Screening Period  – Subjects who have given written consent to participate in the trial will 
undergo safety and qualifying procedures between Day -21 and Day -1 (Screening Visit ). At 
this visit, the subject’s Treatment Field will be identified and the subject will be trained to 
precisely measure and apply the study  drug without actually applying ointment to their 
Treatment Field . Subjects unable to express the proper dose from the study drug tube and/or 
unable to identify their Treatment Field  will be required to bring a dosing partner to the next 
study visit in order to proceed in the study.  
Subjects who meet all the study’s inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will 
return on Day 1 for baseline assessments to ensure they still meet the study enrollment 
criteria  (Day 1 Pre-D ose Visit ). During this  visit, the Treatment Field sele cted at the 
Screening Visit will be requalified.  If the field previously chosen fails to requalify, a ne w 
Treatment Field must be found or the subject must be excluded for failure to meet Inclusion 
Criterion #3 (Section 8.1). Subjects will be trained  and tested twice during this visit for 
proper dose measurement (using the Dosing Cards  13.6.2), proper identification of the 
Treatment Field (us ing the Treatment Field Template 22.4), and precise dosing of that field 
using the template (stencil) . Subjects (or their dosing partner) who are unable to express the 
proper dose from the study drug tube and/or are unable to precisely identify their Treatment 
Field will also be considered ineligible for the study (Inclusion Criterion #4, Section 8.1).  
Subjects who continue to meet all the study enrollment criteria following the Day 1 Pre -Dose 
Visit will be randomized in a double -blinded fashion and proceed to the Day 1 Dosing Visit.  
Subjects enrolled in the PK Study Sub-Cohort will have a pre-dose blood sample drawn.    
Treatment Period  – At the Day 1 Dosing Visit , subjects will apply the assigned study drug 
(i.e., ac tive VDA -1102 or placebo ) under the supervision of site personnel. Details of the 
study drug application are found in Section 13.6. 
From Day 1 through Day 27 subjects will apply the study each evening app roximately 2 
hours before bedtime. Site personnel will communicate with the subject once -weekly.  
On Day 7 and Day 14 all subjects will return to the investigative site for safety and efficacy 
assessments. At each site visit, the subject’s study drug will be weighed and the result will be 
recorded. At each visit, the subject will be re -trained in proper dose application to their 
Treatment Field. Subjects in the PK Study Sub- Cohort will have a blood sample ta ken 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 24

approximately 12 hours after their evening respective Day 6 and Day 13 evening doses. 
Subjects in the Nested Phase 1b Safety Sub -Cohort will undergo an additional physical 
examination, 12- lead ECG, and clinical laboratory assessment  on Day 7.  
Subjects  will return to the site on Day 28 for safety and efficacy assessments. Subjects in the 
PK Study Sub -Cohort will undergo blood sampling for analysis at approximately 12, 15, 18, 
and 21 hours after their Day 27 study drug application. Remaining study drug w ill be 
collected from all subjects at this visit.  
Observation Period – On Day 35 subjects will return to the site for efficacy and safety 
assessments. Subjects in the PK Study Sub- Cohort will undergo a single untimed blood 
sampling. Subjects in the PK Stu dy Sub -Cohort will have a PK sample drawn at the time of 
their visit. Subjects will return to the sites on Day 56 for efficacy and safety assessments. At 
the End-of- Study visit on Day 84, final efficacy and safety assessments will be performed  
followed by discharge from the study. Any subject with active TEAE(s) will be followed 
beyond this scheduled visit until resolution.

previous evening ). At the D ay 28  Visit, three additional PK samples will be collected at 15, 18 and 21 hours (±30 mins) after 
the Day 27 evening dose.   A final sample will be collected at the  Day 35 Visit, at any time during that vis it with the time 
noted .  
7.3 Nested Phase 1b Safety Sub-Cohort  
The first 15  (PK and non- PK) subjects enrolled in the trial will undergo on Day 7 the safety 
examinations planned for all other subjects plus a physical examination, clinical laboratory 
tests, and an ECG assessment . Once all 15 subjects in this Nested Phase 1b Safety Sub -
Cohort have completed t heir Day 7 Visit , available blinded safety data (including AEs, LSR 
scores, clinical laboratory results, and ECG data) from Day 1 through Day 7 will be reviewed 
within 10 business days by a safety committee consisting of 2 Board -certified physicians not 
involved in the trial and the Study Medical Monitor  (a Board -certified Allergist and 
Internist) . During this blinded interim safety review, enrolled subjects will continue dosing 
the study drug and study enrollment will remain open.  
7.4 PK Study Sub-Cohort 
Of the approximate 84 subjects to be enrolled in this trial, a maximum of 18 subjects  (who 
meet more stringent enrollment criteria than the other subjects enrolled ) at select sites, will 
undergo blood sampling for PK analysis on Day 1 Pre -Dose as well as on Day s 7, 14, 28, and 
35 (Table 6). In addition, these  subjects will undergo 24-hour c ardiac Holter monitoring on  
Day 28  so that ECGs may be extracted based upon the other safety findings and the plasma 
PK data.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 28

Subjects included in this sub-c ohort may also be included in the Nested Phase 1b Safety Sub -
Cohort if they are one of the first 15 subjects to be enrolled into the study. 
7.5 Safety Reporting  
7.5.1 Expedited Reporting  to Sponsor and CRO 
In addition to the reporting requirements for serious adverse events  (SAEs) described in 
Section 16, all  severe AEs  must be reported to the Study Medical Monitor and the site’s CRO 
contact within 24 hours.  
All dose holidays and adjustments ( described in Section 7.6 below ) must  be reported to the 
Study Safety Monitor (Sponsor) and the site’s CRO contact within 24 hours. Such 
occurrences must be documented in the eCRF along with the reason for their occurrence.  
In addition, if at any time durin g the course of the trial a potentially serious safety fin ding is 
noted by an Investigator , the Sponsor’s Stud y Medical Monitor and the site’s CRO contact 
must be notified within 24 hours. 
7.6 Dose Holidays and Adjustments  
Subject may be offered the following options at the Investigator’s discretion:  
a) To temporarily stop the study drug for up to 7 days and to re- assess within that period;  
b) To temporarily stop the study drug for up to 7 days and instruct the subject to re -start 
the study drug application every other evening. The study drug may even be advanced 
to once- daily application as tolerated; or   
c) To stop the study drug for the duration of the trial but follow the subject otherwise as 
planned. 
Bland moisturizers may be recommended at any time to any subject to manage LSRs. However, the moisturizer should be applied no sooner than 6 hours after dosing and the Treatment Field should be washed with mild soap before the next study drug application.     2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 29

occurred.  Section s 15 and 16 , respe ctively, contain  additional information with regard to 
AEs and SAEs. 
9.4.2 Vital Signs , Weight, Height , and BMI 
Throughout the study, vital signs (resting blood pressure, heart  rate, temperature, and 
respiratory rate) will be  obtained with the subject sitting or lying, after the subject has rested 
for at least 2 minutes.  
Heart rates are best  obtained e lectronically, if available.  If heart rate data are obtained 
electronically, the results may not be obtained from an ECG sche duled at the same time.  If 
these data are obtained manually, a minimum observation period of 30 sec is required.   
Respiratory rate will be determined following a minimum observation of 30 sec.  
The subject’s height and weight will be documented in the CRF during the Screening visit. 
BMI calculations will be performe d as per the BMI calculator on the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute web site: 
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm . This site offers the 
option to enter either standard or metric data.  
9.4.3 Physical Examination 
The physical examinations performed during the  trial will include skin, external eyes, oral 
cavity, nodes, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities, and gross motor neurologic examination.  
All abnormal acute and chronic findings must be recorded whether they are new or were 
recorded previously in the CRF. For example, a surgical scar should be recorded on every scheduled physic al examination.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 36

10.1.4 Holter Monitoring  (PK Study Sub-Cohort only) 
Subjects in the PK Study Sub-Cohort will undergo approximately 24-hour s of continuous 
multi- lead cardiac telemetric monitoring from Day 28 (approximately 12 hours after the  Day 
27 dosing) through Day 2 9. Subjects will remove the monitors on Day 29, approximately 24 
hours after they are attached , and return the Holter recorder at  the Day 35 Visit.  
ERT’s instruction manual  describes proper use and placement of these monitors. Site 
personnel will be trained regarding proper placement of the electrodes and recorders.  
The purpose of the 24-hour cardiac Holter monitor recording is to allow ECGs to be extracted 
based upon the plasma PK findings.  
10.1.5 Local Skin Reaction Score  
The Investigator (or designee) will use the Local Skin Reaction ( LSR) Score (see Section 
22.1) to numerically assess the overall degree of erythema, edema, weeping / exudate, 
vesicles, erosions / ulcerations, scaling / dryness, scabbing / crusting, itching, or pain)  in the 
Treatmen t Field  on a 5-point scale , from 0 (none) to 4 (severe).  This assessment will be 
performed on Day 1 Pre -Dose (baseline) and repeated at each subsequent visit.  The 
individual scores for each potential finding will be recorded in the respective cells by the 
assessor.  
In this trial LSRs will be collected independently of AEs. Details regarding reporting are 
included in Section 15.1. 
10.1.6 Once- Weekly Subject Contact  
Site personnel will contact each subject once- weekly  during the Treatment Period . The goals 
of this contact are: (a) to review the Dosing Instruction Packet and Dosing Diary with each 
subject ; (b) to answer any questions raised by the study participants;  (c) to remind subjects of 
their upcoming site v isit and any related activities; and (d) to remind subjects to bring their 
study drug to each site visit.  
10.2  Pharmacokinetic Measures (PK Study Sub- Cohort only) 
A maximum of eighteen subjects will participate in the PK Study Sub -Cohort. Blood samples 
for measurement of plasma VD A-1102 and its primary  metabolite jasmonic acid (JA) will be 
taken at Day 1 Pre- dose. Post -dose blood sampli ng will occur at the Days 7, Day 14 , and Day 
28 Visits at approximately 12 hours after the Day 6, Day 13, and Day 27 evening doses , 
respectively. On Day 28, the  sample should b e drawn as close to 12 hours after the previous 
evening’s dose as possible, and additional samples should be drawn at approximately 15, 18, 
and 21 hours (±30 mins) after the Day 27 evening dose . A final sample will be collected on 
Day 35. The exact time of each blood sampling will be recorded in the EDC.   2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 39

11. PROCEDURES FOR EFFICACY EVALUATIONS  
11.1 AK Lesions  
11.1.1 AK Lesion Grading  
This trial will use th e AK lesion clinical grading established by Olsen et al  and as 
recommended by the International League of Dermatologic Societies and the European 
Dermatology Forum:  
Grade 1 – mild (s lightly palpable AK that are felt better than seen)  
Grade 2 – moderate (moderately thick AK that are easily seen and felt)  
Grade 3 - severe (very thick and/or obvious AK) . Treatment Fields selected for this trial must 
not contain any Grade 3 AK lesions (se e Section 11.1.2, below). 
11.1.2 AK Lesion  Eligibility  
In order to be eligible for this trial, the AK lesions must meet each of the following criteria:  
a. Grade 1 or Grade 2 AK lesions (Section 11.1.1);  
b. located on the subject’s forehead, cheeks, or scalp but not on the  lips, submandibular 
area, or neck;  
c. discrete (i.e., no borders are clearly touching one another) ;  
d. a maximum diameter 10 mm (inclusive) in any direction ; 
e. non-hypertrophic and non- hyperkeratotic (i.e., no thick scale, horn, or > 1 mm raised  
above background skin); and  
f. not atrophic, acantholytic, pigmented, or Bowenoid.  
11.1.3 Treatment Field  Selection  
Any 25 cm2 contiguous area on the face or scalp of the subject that contains  4-8 AK l esions 
that meet the requirements stated in AK Lesion Eligibility  criteria (section 11.1.2) may be 
selected as the study Treatment Field. The Tre atment Field will be selected at Screening and 
confirmed on Day 1 Pre -Dose. If the Treatment Field selected at Screening is no longer 
eligible at Day 1 Pre -Dose, a new Treatment Field may be selected on Day 1 Pre-Dose.  
It is reco mmended that the Treatment  Field be a square or rectangle and that is visible to the 
subject when looking in the mirror. Treatment Fields not visible to the subject when looking 
in the mirror are best managed by having a dosing partner help with the dosing. Dosing 
partners must accompany the subject on Da y 1 so as to undergo training and testing like all 
the subjects who self-dose.   2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 41

The Treatment Field  or its outer border must not be: 
a) Within 2.5 cm (~1 inch) of either labial commissure of the mouth, lip vermilion 
border, palpebral fissure or a suspected or proven malignancy ; 
b) Close to another active dermatologic process that could spread to the Treatment Field 
and interfere with the proper assessment of the Treatment Field and/or its included 
AK lesions;  or 
c) So close to the eyebrow s, beard , or other area with hair as to interfere with proper 
application of the study drug or assessment of the Treatment Field .  
NOTE: Ideally other AKs should NOT  be adjacent to the bo rder of the Treatment Field 
which could confound the AK lesion counti ng or identification of  the Treatment Field at 
subsequent study visits.  
11.1.4 Study Tools 
The following 3 study tools will be used for Treatment Field selection , AK Lesion counts, 
Study Drug measurement, and Study Drug Application. The preliminary tools will be 
supplied by the Sponsor; Investigator s (or designee) will prepare the final tools for use by the 
sites and the subject .   
Examples of the 3 study tools appear in Section 22.2 (Treatment Field Map), Section 22.4 
(Treatment Field Template ), and Section 22.6 (Subject Dosing Card).  
1. Treatment Field Map  - This flexible, 8.5 x 11 inch plastic transparency with 1 cm x 1 
cm grid printed on the surface will be used by the Investigator (or designee) to: (a) 
define a Treatment Field at Screening and Day 1 Pre- Dose Visits; (b) count AK lesions 
in the Treatment Field; and ( c) to create the Treatment Field Template. Instructions 
regarding use of this tool appear in the Treatment Field Map Instructions (Section 22.3).   
2. Treatment Field Template – The tool consists of  a clear, thin, flexible, 8.5 x 11 inch

b. Subject (or dosing partner):  (a) to identify their unique Treatment Field and (b) to 
apply the study drug precisely to their Treatment Field. Instructions regarding use 
of this tool appear in the Treatment Field Template Instructions (Section 22.5). 
3. Dosing Card – a clear, thin, flexible plastic transparency  with a rectangle printed on the 
back side. A strip of ointment expressed from the study drug tube that fits the clear 
portion of the rectangle is the correct approximate dose of study drug to be applied to 
the Treatment Field. A new previously unused Dosi ng Card will be used each evening 
by the subject to measure their proper study drug dose, and will be discarded after use . 
A sample of the Dosing Card is included in Section 22.6. Instructions regarding use of 
the Dosing Card are included in the Subject Instruction Packet.  
11.1.5 AK Lesion  Count  
At the Screening and Day -1 Pre -Dose Visits, the selected Treatment Field  must include at 
least four (4) and no more than eight (8) visible and discrete non- hyperk eratotic, non-
hypertrophic AK lesions.  
All AK lesions in the selected contiguous 25 cm2 Treatment Field  will be identif ied, counted, 
graded,  and recorded at each vis it. 
If the subject has a LSR that prevents the investigator or designee from performing the AK count at a visit, the investigator or designee should document in the source document and CRF that the AK count was unable to be obtained due to a LSR. 
11.1.6 Photograp hy 
Photography will be performed at designated study visit(s) at selected sites participating in 
this study as specified per protocol. The selected study sites will be provided with suggested guidelines to assist them in taking standardized photographs. However, it should be noted that all study sites, at the discretion of the investigator, may elect to photograph the subject 
under various magnification and lighting conditions to document the effects of treatment, 
adverse events or other findings during the  trial. All photographs taken as part of this study 
are for informational purposes only and are not to assist in grading or for any other 
assessment.  
Note: Subjects may decline to have photographs taken during the conduct of the study. If a subject initia lly consents to photographs, then declines further photography, the Sponsor may 
use the photographs taken under consent for the purposes noted.

12. CONDUCT OF THE STUDY 
12.1 Study Blinding and Randomization 
12.1.1 Randomization 
Assignment of study drug will be perform ed using a web-based Interactive Responsive 
Technology (IRT) -based randomization system. On Day 1 Pre-Dose , after confirming the 
subject’s eligibility, the Investigator  (or his designee ) may approve the subject’s blinded 
randomization.  
The web -based IRT will ra ndomize subjects in a fashion that will maintain a balance among 
the 3 treatment groups (5% and 10% VDA -1102, and placebo) across all subjects enrolled 
(not per site) and within the PK Study Sub-Cohort.  
Subjects who withdraw or are terminated after  1 study dose has been applied will not be 
replaced in the trial.  
Should a subject lose or destroy a tube, the IRT is capable of assigning additional study drug 
to each subject with the appropriate treatment assignment.  
12.1.2 Blinding  
All site staff at the inv estigative sites, Sponsor, CROs , and vendor s as well as all enrolled 
subjects will be masked to the study drug assignments throughout the trial . One pre-
designated statistician will have access to the blinded treatment assignments and be 
responsible for al l activities that re quire unblinding, including the per protocol Interim 
Efficacy Analysis (Section  17.4).  
12.1.3 Unblinding  
In the event of an emergency , the Investigator (or designee) should contact the Study Medi cal 
Monitor to discuss the case before unblinding of an individual subject’s treatment code is 
broken by the site. If the medical condition of the subject warrants immediate unblinding, the 
treatment assignment of the subject may be obtained from the IRT without first consulting the 
Study Medical Monitor. However, the site must contact the Study Medical Monitor as soon 
as possible after the unblinding.  
An interim efficacy analysis will perfo rmed after approximately 50% of the enrolled subjects 
have completed their Day 56 Visit and their data have been recorded . The single pre -
designated unblinded statistician  described above in Section 12.1.2 will perform this analysis. 
The specifics of this interim analysis will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
12.2 Subject Informed Consent  
Written consent will be obtained from the subject prior to any study -specific procedure or 
investigation.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 44

Travel  
If a subject needs to transport the study drug  (while travelling on vacation or business, or to 
the site ), they will be instructed  to protect the study  drug from heat  in the supplied cooler 
pack . The drug should not be placed in the trunk of a car or in checked luggage on a plane.  
Subjects planning to travel away from home should contact their site in order to receive 
instructions how to properly care for the study drug. 
13.6 Study Drug Dispensing and Administration  
13.6.1 Study Drug Dispensing   
Following conclusion of the Da y 1 Pre -Dose procedures, the Investigator (or designee) will 
assure that the subject still meets all the study enrollment criteria. The investigator may then 
approve subject randomization.  
Based on the randomization number generated by the IVRS, the site personnel (or 
institutional pharmacist) will allocate the app ropriate study drug for each subject. The tube 
with its aluminum envelope will be removed from its container  in the refrigerator. The 
envelope will be opened by site personnel and the tube removed.  The aluminum envelope 
will be retained at the site for mo nitoring purposes and the tube will be placed in the 
container until dosing time.   
13.6.2 Study Drug Dosing Cards  
Study Drug Dosing Cards will be distributed to all the sites.  These cards will be used: (a) by 
site personnel to train and to test subjects in the proper length of the study drug ointment strip 
to be expressed and applied to the Treatment Field, and (b) by enrolled subjects to measure 
the appropriate length of study drug ointment to be applied each evening to their  Treatment 
Field.    
A sample of the Dosing Card is included in Section 22.6. Instructions regarding proper use of 
the Dosing Card are included in the Subject Instruction Sheet.  
13.6.3 Study Drug Measurement and Application Review 
All sites will receive tubes of placebo with which to train all subjects to measure the 
appropriate quantity of study drug to be applied. These training tubes will be clearly marked.  
Using the Treatment Field Template, placebo  training ointment, and a Study Drug Dosing 
Card, the subject will be trained and tested in proper and precise dosing techniques.  
Note: Training tubes containing placebo ointment will only be used to practice 
measurement of the proper study drug dose on the Dosing Card and not for application 
to the face during training and testing.    2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 59

Screening Visit  
Subjects will be trained and tested by site personnel at the Screening Visit. The subject will 
be taught to measure the study drug using placebo tubes supplied by the Sponsor. The 
subjects will also be taught how to apply the study drug, but they will not use the placebo for 
this part of the training. In other words, placebo should not be applied to their skin during the 
training.  
Subjects who have difficulty measuring the dose or applying the study drug to the precisely 
may be asked to bring a dosing partner with them to the Day 1 Pre -Dose Visit. This dosing 
partner must be willing and able to assist the subject with study drug application once every even ing for 28 days.  
If the subject (or dosing partner) is unlikely to apply the study drug appropriately, the subject 
should be terminated from the study based on Inclusion#4 (Section 8.1).  
Day 1 Pre- Dose Visit  
Subjects who continue to meet the study enrollment criteria following Screening will be 
trained and tested twice  by site personnel during the Day 1 Pre -Dose Visit: once at the 
beginning of the visit and once again at the end of the visit  before randomization. If the 
subject (or dosing partner) is unlikely to apply the study drug appropriately, the subject 
should be excluded  from the study based on Inclusion #4 (Section 8.1). 
Day 1 Dosing Visit 
Dosing at this visit will occur under the supervision of the site personnel.  If at this visit the subject is unable to precisely prepare the study drug or is unable to properly locate the 
Treatment Field, they should be withdrawn before the study drug is applied. Application of 
the study drug during this visit will be the same as described in Section 13.6.4, below.  
13.6.4 Study Drug Administration at Home   
The study drug will be applied to the Treatment Field by the subject (or dosing partner) each 
evening  approximately 2 hours before bedtime. If the subject would like to shower, wash 
their face, shampoo their hair, etc. before bedtime, these should be performed prior to study 
drug application . 
At the dosing time, the subject should check the Treatment Field  in the mirror to assure it is 
clean and dry.  
The study drug tube will be removed from the container, the tube cover unscrewed, and the 
study drug ointment expressed as a strip into the rectangle printed on  the supplied Dosing 
Card .  
Using a mirror, photographs, and/or the landmarks drawn on the Treatment  Field Template , 
the template  will be appropriately positioned on the subjec t’s face or scalp . The subject (or 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 60

dosing partner) will apply the study drug to the Treatment Field on their skin that corresponds 
to the 25 cm2 area cut out  of the template. S ubject s (or their dosing partner s) will apply the 
study drug with one finger to the center of the Treatment Field and spread the ointment 
evenly over the entire field. The Treatment Field will not be occluded.  The subject will 
remove the T reatment Field Template from their  face.  With the same finger, t he subject will 
spread ointment at the periphery of the Treatment Field approximately ¼ inch beyond the Treatment Field perimeter in order to insure that the whole Treatment Field was covered with 
study drug.  
The subject will be instructed not to wet or touch the Treatment Field  from the time o f dosing 
until the following morning.  
13.7 Study Drug Accountability and Dosing Compliance  
The CRO will request the Investigator or their designee to sign a receipt for the  study drugs 
on the day of arrival at the site.  The site pharmacist and/or the assigned site personnel will be 
responsible for drug accountability. A drug accountability record should be maintained by the 
person responsible for dispensing the study drug to the subject.  This should record which 
supplies arrived at the site and which container(s) is issued to each subject . The Medical 
Monitor should be notified of details of any supplies which are inadvertently damaged.  
Details of any supplies which are inadvertently damaged or unaccountable for any reason 
should be given on this drug accountability record, which will be col lected at the end of the 
study.   
All drugs will be inventoried by the monitor during and at the conclusion of the study.  
Secure dis posal or return of unused supplies to the Sponsor at the end of the study will be 
arranged.  
A single 10 mL tube of study drug will be assigned to each subject. Each tube will be 
weighed prior to the first dosing and at Day 7, 14, and 28 Visits. Subjects wi ll also be asked 
during the once -weekly communication with the site and at each site visit whether they 
missed any doses  and responses will be appropriately documented in the subject’s medical 
record . In addition, subjects will complete a Dosing Diary , following each evening dose , with 
the date and time of dosing.

14. CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ON 
Any prescription or non- prescription medication, alternative medication, herbal product, 
homeopathic substance, etc. us ed by the subject from 30  days prior to Screening until the 
subjects leaves the trial will be referred to as a Concomit ant Medication. The Investigator is 
to record the use of all concomitant medications, both prescribed and over -the- counter, in the 
CRF.   
Subjects should be advised against taking any new medication, both prescribed and over -the-
counter, without consulting the Investigator, unless the new medication is urgently required 
for emergency  use.  Subjects taking medication other than those listed as prohibited in 
Section 12.6.1 may continue taking their routine medications and vitamins so long as they 
have been taking them for at least 2 months prior to Screening with no change in dose, 
manufacturer, or dosing interval. 
At Screening and Day -1 Pre-Dose Visits , the study site personnel will check each subject’s 
concomitant medications to ensure that subjects are not taking any prohibited medications 
listed in Section 12.6.1. 
The Investigator  and his designees are obligated to ensure the well -being of all subjects 
during this study. Consequently, no medication or treatment should be withheld from a 
subject requiring medical intervention.  This may include treatments received by the subject prior to enrollment as well as in response to any new medical conditions that developed 
during the study.  The Investigator (or designee) must inform a subject when concomitant 
medical intervention or treatment is indicated and report this in the appropriate section of the 
CRF.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 62

15. ADVERSE EVENTS  
15.1 Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the 
pharmaceutical product treatmen t.  Any worsening of the subject’s disease under study or 
other medical conditions will also be considered to be an AE, unless it is within the normal 
range of disease fluctuation for that subject.  
In this trial LSRs will be collected independently of AEs.  Any LSR that occurs within 
the selected Treatment Field and extends to adjacent surrounding skin (defined as within a 2 cm border around the Treatment Area) will be considered LSRs and will not 
be recorded as AEs.  LSRs that require medical intervention (prescription medication) or extend beyond the 2 cm surrounding skin should be documented as an AE.  
Clinically meaningful (for a given subject) changes i n physical examination and test findings 
should also be recorded as AEs.  The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows: 
1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
3. Test result leads  to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or 
4. Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a SAE. 
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
meet Condition 2 above for reporting as an AE. 
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) are AEs that occur  de novo  or worsen 
following the initiation of study treatment.  
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures taken for the AE, 
and should be documented as such.   
Planned hospital admissions documented in the subject’s CRF prior to randomization and 
study- related procedures are also not AEs.  
Overdoses of the study drug will not be reported as an AE. However, any AEs or SAEs, as 
defined in Section 15, associated with an overdose will be reported as such. 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 63

15.2 Clarification of the Difference between “Severe” and “Serious”  
Severity describes the intensity of an event, irrespective of its medical significance (such as 
severe headache).  This is not the same as seriousness, which is based on regulatory 
definitions. Seriousness (not severity) defines SAE reporting obligations.  The severity of all 
AEs will be graded on a 3- point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in detail on the 
CRF.   
• Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. 
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity.  
• Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
15.3 AE Reporting  
Specific instructions regarding the reporting of AEs, including start and stop dates, relationship to study drug, outcomes, expectedness, etc. will be detailed in the Safety Monitoring Plan.  
15.4 Relationship to Study Treatments  
“Causality” refers to the relationship of the AE to the study drug. The investigator must 
include assessment of causality (whether there is a reasonable possibility the drug caused the 
event) for each AE. Causality will be categorized according to the following criteria:  
 
• Not Related : There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may  be related to 
study drug usage and other causes are much  more likely.  
• Unlikely Related:  There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related 
to study drug usage, but a relationship cannot be completely ruled out. There are other 
more likely causes.  
• Possibly Related : There is weak medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be 
related to study drug usage and a relationship cannot be completely ruled out. 
• Likely Related:  There is good me dical evidence to suggest that the AE may  be 
related to study drug usage but other causes cannot be ruled out completely.  
• Related : There is a strong and convincing medical evidence to suggest that the AE  is 
related to study drug usage and other possible c auses are highly unlikely.  
15.5 Laboratory Test and Diagnostic Procedure Abnormalities 
An abnormal result will not be recorded as an AE unless one or more of the below occurs: 
• The abnormal test is accompanied by symptoms.  
• The test result leads to an alteration or interruption in study medication. 
• The test result requires medical or surgical intervention  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 64

• The test result is considered clinically significant by an Investigator.  
If such an event occurs, the test should be repeated within 10 days to confirm the finding and 
appropriately monitored.   
15.6 Follow- up of Adverse Events  
All AE related symptoms and/or signs will be followed until there is a return to the baseline 
status, all associated parameters have returned to normal (or are no longer cons idered 
clinically significant), or no further improvement is anticipated.  Follow -up is mandatory, 
irrespective of causal relationship to the study drug(s).  SAEs will be monitored until 
resolution, as medically indicated.   
Any subject who has received at  least 1 dose of the study drug and has experienced an AE 
that has not resolved or stabilized, may be invited to attend and unscheduled visits. S ubjects 
with AEs that have not resolved or stabilized should be followed until resolution of the AE  or 
for a minimum of 30 days  after  the subject’s last application of the study medication. 
15.7 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events by Investigator 
Instructions for the completion of AE reports in a clinical study are provided by the Sponsor 
in the Safety Monitoring Plan.

16. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
16.1 Definition  
An SAE is any AE that, at any dose, results  in at least one of the following outcomes: 
1. Death.  Death is an outcome, not an event.  Where the cause of death is uncertain, the 
reported SAE should be the same as the term on the subject’s death certificate.  
2. Is life -threatening.  Life -threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death 
at the time of the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires or prol ongs inpatient hospitalization.  
4. Persistent or significant disability or incapacity. “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life function s. 
5. A congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
6. A medically serious event based upon appropriate medical judgment.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
16.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Full details of SAE reporting will appear in the Safety Monitoring Plan.  
16.2.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Event s by Investigators 
If the AE is serious, the Investigator must complete an SAE Report form, in addition to the 
AE page in the CRF. 
Any SAE, whether or not related to the study treatment , must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Study Medical Monitor  and the CRO  responsible for the site.  The following contact and 
communication methods may be used. The Medical Monitor and CRO will confirm receipt 
upon receiving the notification.   2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 66

The SAE Report Form must be completed in accordance with instructions provided by the 
Sponsor or designee.  The completed form must be faxed or emailed to the Study Safety 
Monitor within 24 hours of discovery of the SAE.  
If, for any reason, the Investigator cannot notify the Study Safety Monitor  via the appropriate 
form or if the Investigator suspects that using this method will delay the notification (e.g. , 
during a holiday period), the Investigator must  verbally notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor 
(or designee)  via telephone.  The SAE Report form must still be relayed at the earliest 
possible opportunity.  SAEs must be reported to the IRB according to IRB guidelines.  The initial report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and 
the SAE, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the 
investigational product(s) or the study procedures. 
Information not  available at the time of the initial report (e .g., an end date for the AE or 
laboratory values received after the report) must be documented as a follow -up on the SAE 
Report form.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 67

In addition, when a non- serious event becomes serious, details must be forwarded, within 24 
hours of Investigator awareness that an AE has become serious, to the Sponsor or designee on 
an SAE Report form, with the date of the seriousness upgrade as the SAE start date. 
All ancillary documentation (e .g. discharge letters, lab oratory reports and consultations) must  
be sent to the Sponsor or designee.  I n the event of an SAE resulting in death, post -mortem 
reports should be routinely sent to the Sponsor or designee. 
Any serious adverse events (SAEs)  including death due to any cause, which occurs in any 
subject through Day 84, whether or not related to the investigational  product, must be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours.  All subjects with SAEs must be followed -up for 
outcome. 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 68

17. STATISTICAL PLAN  
17.1 Sample Size Rationale and Justifica tion 
The primary objective of the trial is to compare the reduction on Day 56 in the number of the 
AK lesions (or % reduction if baseline measure will be found different between the groups) 
in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving 5% or 10% VDA -1102 ointment to the reduction 
in the number of AK lesions in subjects receiving placebo. The sample size calculation was based on demonstrating an effect size of 0.83 using a two group t -test with a 0.045 two- sided 
significance level. The total significance level of 5% was divided between the interim analysis 0.5% (0.005) and the final analysis 4.5% (0.045). The sample size calculation was 
based on the final significance. The spending function calculation for alpha will be performed using the O
'Brien -Flem ing approach. Assuming a drop- out rate of 10%, approximately 84 
subjects will be recruited in order to complete the study with a sample of approximately 75 evaluable subjects.  
A sample size of 25 in each group will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.83 using 
a two group T-test with a 0.045 two- sided significance level.  
17.2 Statistical analysis 
All measured variables and  derived parameters will be listed individually and, if appropriate, 
tabula ted by descriptive statistics. For categorical variables summary tables will be provided 
giving sample size, absolute and relative frequency and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) for proportions by treatment group. For continuous variables summary tables will be provided 
giving sample size, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum and maximum and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) for means of  variabl es 
by treatment group. The data will be analyzed using the SAS ® version 9.3 or higher (SAS 
Institute, Cary North Carolina).  
17.2.1 Efficacy Analysis 
The efficacy analysis will be performed with the ITT, mITT , and PP  populations (see Section 
17.5.2).  The primary  efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in number of AK lesions. 
If the baseline lesions number will be found different between the treatment groups, then 
relative change ( %) will be analyzed as well. The within -group absolute changes (decrease) 
in AK number of lesions from baseline to each visit will be analyzed using paired t -test or 
signed rank test for two means (paired observations, as is appropriate). 
Comparative analysis of the above changes will be applied between each of the active groups 
versus the placebo group using the two -sample t -test, the non- parametric Wilcoxon -Mann -
Whitney rank sum test for independent samples, or the Median test (as appropriate).  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 69

If no statistically significant differences are observed between the two active VDA -1102 
groups then these two groups will be pooled and compared to the placebo group in order to 
achieve higher statistical power.  
The overall effect and trend of differences in the changes over time between the groups will be analyzed using a mixed -effect model for repeated measures. The model will include 
changes from baseline at any time, the fixed effect time, and the interaction of treatment and time. Contrast will be calculated for each time point ( Days 7, 14, 28, 35 and 56) versus  
baseline and the overall effect. The model will be adjusted for baseline measure and for other 
covariates suspected as affecting the outcome and which will be found different between the treatment groups.  
In case the bas eline number of lesions differs  between the groups, analysis of relative change 
(%) will be applied as well.  
Chi-square test or Fi sher’s e xact test (as is appropriate) will be used for analyzing the 
difference in percent of subjects with complete clearance of study AK lesions at the end of the treatment. L ogistic regression will be applied for analyzing the difference in proportions 
with adjustment for baseline measure and for other covariates suspected as affecting the outcome and which will be found different between the treatment groups.  
17.2.2 Safety Assessme nts 
The safety end point data will be summarized for the ITT population.  AEs will be 
categorized by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Terms (PT) using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 19.1 or higher).  The incidence of  
AEs, as well as the intensity and relationship to study drug will be summarized by treatment 
group.  Safety will also be assessed by evaluating findings of physical examinations, vital signs, dermatologic assessments, clinical laboratory test results, 12 -lead ECG tracings, Local 
Skin Reaction Score, drug exposure, concomitant medications, and withdrawals/terminations.  
These findings will be summarized and compared between treatments and within treatment 
group compared to findings from baseline evaluations.   
Local Skin Reaction scores (LRS) will be summarized by treatment.      
17.2.3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Non-compartmental PK parameters (e.g., AUC, C
max, Tmax, t1/2) will be calculated, if possible.  
17.2.4 Exploratory Endpoints A ssessment  
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test (as is appropriate) will be used for analyzing the 
difference in percent of subjects with complete clearance of study AK lesions at the end of 
the treatment. Logistic regression will be applied for analyzing the diffe rence in proportions 
with adjustment for baseline measure and for other covariates suspected as affecting the 
outcome and which will be found different between the treatment groups.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 70

Sensitivity analysis will be applied for identifying the cut- off of the change (or relative 
change) from baseline in number of lesions on Day 56. Analysis of the difference in the 
binary change will be applied using Chi -square test or Fisher ’s exact test. Logistic regression 
will be applied for analyzing these differences with  adjustment for baseline measure and f or 
other covariates suspected of  affecting the outcome and which will be found different 
between the treatment groups.  
Additional exploratory endpoint assessments will be described in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  
17.3 Missing Data 
Assuming the scope of missing data of the primary efficacy endpoint will be significant, data 
imputation will be applied. Missing data at random imputation (MAR) will be performed for 
those subjects with missing data. Multiple imputation will b e applied using SAS PROC MI to 
perform the imputations. Sensitivity analysis will be used for detecting differences between 
the analyses with and without data imputation. 
17.4 Interim Efficacy A nalysis 
An interim efficacy analysis will be conducted as soon as approximately 50% of the subjects 
have completed the study. The objective of the interim analysis is to evaluate the probability 
to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The data for the interim analysis sub -set will be collected and analyzed for effect size and t -
value. Effect size will be calculated based on the difference in the change from baseline in 
AK lesions for each of the active groups as compared to the placebo group. Relative change 
(%) will be used if baseline measure will be found different between the groups.  
Futility will be based on O'Brien -Fleming boundaries. If the t -value with 22 degrees of 
freedom is below 0.34, then the study is unlikely to succeed when taken to completion. In 
case the distribution of the outcome variable will not be found with approximation to 
normality, then appropriate non- parametric methods will be considered for the interim 
analysis.  
17.5 Data Sets  
17.5.1 Intent -to-Treat Population  
The ITT population will be defined as all subjects who are randomized and who receive study 
drug.  This is an appropriate population for the primary analysis because this is a blinded trial 
and the dose will be applied in the clinic by the research clinic staff.   2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 71

All safety analyses will be performed on the ITT population.  Subjects will be analyzed 
according to the treatment actually received, not the treatment they were supposed to have received.  
17.5.2 Modified ITT (mITT) Population 
The mITT population includes all ITT patients who completed the study and have protocol deviations that do not significantly impact efficacy. The mITT population will also be used 
for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. 
17.5.3  Per-Protocol Population  
The PP population includes all ITT patients who have no major protocol deviations. The PP 
population will also be used for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. 
17.5.4 Pharmacokinetic Population  
A maximum of 18 subjects enrolled in the PK Study Sub- Cohort wil l constitute the PK 
population. 
17.5.5 Definitions of the Terms Violation and Deviation 
Violation  – Any enrolled subject who does not meet the study enrollment criteria (see 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria in Section 8) will be considered a violation.  
Deviation  – Any activity that diverges from the procedures defined by this clinical protocol 
will be considered a deviation.  
A major deviation  is one that will definitely, probably or possibly significantly impact the 
subject safety or the quality of the trial data. An example of a major deviation is a subject 
who missed dosing >7 consecutive days of study drug.  A minor deviation  is one that does not, or is unlikely to, significantly impact subject safety 
or the quality of the trial data.  
All violations and deviations must be recorded in the study site’s electronic system and 
signed by the Investigator (or designee).  
It is the Sp onsor’s responsibility to determine whether the event will be considered a 
violation, major deviation, or minor deviation.   
17.5.6 Subject Compliance Definitions  
Subjects in the Treatment Period will be contacted by site personnel once-weekly.  During 
that telep hone conversation, subject compliance with the study drug dosing will be obtained 
and recorded.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 72

18. STUDY MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION  
18.1 Data Collection Methods 
An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be utilized in this trial. The EDC system is 
fully validated and conforms to Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11 and the 
Guidance for Industry on Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials requirements.  The 
system has capabilities such as on -line data review via the browser, tracking review status of 
eCRFs  with built- in flagging, issuance and tracking of electronic Data Clarification Forms  
(queries) , and real -time vie wing of entered subject’s da ta.  If the EDC is not ready to accept 
data by the time the trial begins enrollment, data may be entered on paper CRFs and 
transferred to the EDC as soon as it is ready to accept data.  
The trained Investigational site staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the eCRFs from source documents into the EDC system.  All information on the eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents.   Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be 
discussed with the study site for resolution.  The study site is responsible for providing 
missing data and  resolutions to the data queries and for correcting the eCRFs as appropriate.  
Electronic CRFs must be reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator.  All original laboratory, and ECG reports will be kept with the subject source documentation and a copy 
will be trans mitted to the Sponsor (or designee), if required. 
Cardiac d ata should be transferred to eRT  (eResearch Technology, Inc., Philadelphia, PA) the 
same day the data are obtained, if possible. Central Laboratory samples should be shipped on 
a daily  basis, if possible, unless specific holiday or w eekend schedules are in effect.  
Data should be entered into the EDC (or paper CRF) within 5 business days of the study visit; 
queries should be appropriately addressed within 3 business days of receipt. Duri ng data 
cleaning and preparations for data lock, queries must be appropriately addressed by the site in 
a timely manner (2 -3 business days).   
18.2 Monitoring  
Vidac Pharma (or their designee) will conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the 
purpose of monitoring a ll aspect s of the study.   
18.3 Data Retention 
All relevant correspondence (e.g. with the Sponsor, CRO, IRB, etc.) relating to this clinical study conduct should be maintained in the appropriate file at the site. 
The Investigator must retain all records, including the source documents, ICFs, central 
laboratory reports including ECGs, and all other study -related documentation for a period of 
at least 2 years following the date the last marketing application is approved for the study 
drug for the indication for which it is being investigated, or 2 years after the date that the 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 74

FDA has been notified that all clinical investigation of the drug has been discontinued, 
whichever is greater, unless notified otherwise in writing by the Sponsor.  These documents should, however, be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulations or if 
requested by the Sponsor. The Investigator must contact the Sponsor and gain written 
approval prior to destroying any records.  No study documents  will be destroyed or moved to 
a new location without prior written approval of the Sponsor.  If the Investigator relocates, retires, or withdraws from a clinical study for any reason, all records required for the study 
should be transferred to an agreed-upon designee, e.g. another Investigator.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 75

19. CLINICAL STUDY ADMINISTRATION, ETHICS, AND CONDUCT  
19.1 Good Clinical Practice  
GCP is an important ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, 
recording and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects.  Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of study 
subjects are protected.  
19.2 Confidentiality  
19.2.1 Study Confidentiality  
All information regarding the nature of the investigation provided by the Sponsor or its designee to the Investigator and his / her staff or designees (except for information required 
by law or regulations to be disclosed to the IRB, the subject, and/or the appropriate regulatory 
authorities) must be maintained in confidence by the Investigator and his / her staff or 
designees.  
19.2.2 Subject Anonymity  
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained.  Subjects will be identified by 
their initials and subject number on eCRFs and other documents submitted to the Sponsor.  Documents not submitted to the Sponsor include those that identify the subject (e g, the 
signed ICF), and must be maintained in strict confidence by the Investigator, except as necessary to allow auditing by the IRB, Sponsor or its designee, FDA, and/or equivalent authorities.  
19.3 Subject Information and Informed Consent  
Before being enrolled in the clinical study, subjects must consent to participate after the nature, scope , and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form 
understandable to them. 
An informed consent document that includes information about the study will be prepared 
and given to the subject.  This document will contain all the elements required by the ICH E6 
Guideline for GCP and any additional elements required by local regulations.  The document 
must be in a language understandable to the subject and must specify who informed the subject.  Where r equired by local law, the person who informs the subject must be a 
physician.  
All ICFs must contain the minimum elements as mandated by the FDA and ICH guidelines and will be subject to the Sponsor’s  (or designee’s)  approval as well as the IRB’s approval.  2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 76

favorable opinion contingent upon the prior Investigator permission and review.   
The Investigator will not undertake any measures or procedures specifically required of  a 
subject for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained. The Investigator should inform the subject’s primary physician about the subject’s 
participation in the study if the subject has a primary physician and if the subject agrees to the primary physician being informed, as per the site’s standard operating procedures. 
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, or increases the potential risk to the subject, the ICF must be revised, subm itted to 
the IRB for review and approval or favorable opinion.  The revised ICF must be used to obtain consent from a subject currently enrolled in the study only if he or she is affected by 
the amendment.  The revised ICF must be used to obtain consent from any new subjects who are enrolled into the study after the date of the approval or favorable opinion of the amendment.  
19.4 Study Closure  
Completion or premature termination of the study will be reported by the Sponsor to the regulatory agency and by the Sponsor or by the Investigator to the IRB as required by local regulations or by the IRB. 
Once the database is locked, and all efforts are made to settle all outstanding queries, site 
closeout will occur.  Study materials must be returned, disposed of , or ret ained, as directed by 
the Sponsor.  
19.5 Early Termination of the Clinical Trial  
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, the clinical observations in the study suggest that it may 
be unwise to continue, the Investigator may terminate the study after consultation with the 
Sponsor.  A written statement fully documenting the reasons for such a termi nation will be 
provided to the Sponsor.  In addition, the Sponsor may terminate the st udy at any time.   
If it becomes apparent that subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  with respect to quality or 
quantity, or that data recording is inaccurate or incomplete on a chronic basis, the Sponsor has the right to terminate the study and remove all study materials from the investigational 
site.  A written statement will be provide d to the Investigator, the IRB, and regulatory 
authorities, if required.  In the event any SAEs or non- SAEs are reported, all documentation 
relating to the event(s) must be obtained. 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 77

20. INVESTIGATOR'S OBLIG ATIONS  
20.1 General  
The Investigator agrees that the stud y will be conducted in accordance with  the clinical 
protocol, FDA’s GCP  guidelines , ICH  guidelines,  and the Decl aration of Helsinki.  The 
Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance  with all governmental, state 
and local laws.  
20.2 Instituti onal Review Board 
Before initiation of the study  at any site , the PI or designee must obtain approval of the 
clinical protocol and ICF from the IRB complying with the provisions specified in FDA CFR, 
Title 21, Part 56, ICH Guidelines, and all gove rnmental,  state and local laws.  
A copy of the written IRB approval of the protocol, ICF and any other documentation (such 
as advertising) as appropriate must be provided to the Sponsor or its designee prior to initiation of the study.  The approval letter must iden tify the IRB name and address, the 
clinical protocol by title and/or protocol number, and the date approval was granted. Furthermore, the approval letter must contain a statement that the IRB complies with the FDA CFR, Title 21, Part 56, and ICH Guidelines  for a study conducted under an IND, or 
other applicable government regulations for studies not conducted under an IND.  
The Investigator is responsible for supplying the IRB with the data required for continued review of this study at intervals not exceeding one year, or at intervals otherwise specified by the IRB.  The Investigator shall supply the Sponsor with written documentation of this 
continued review.  When necessary, an extension or renewal of the IRB approval must be 
obtained and this shall also be forwarded to the Sponsor. A list of the IRB members should be forwarded to the Sponsor in accordance with local regulations. 
The IRB and the regulatory authorities will be provided with any amendments for their 
review and/or approval.  A yearly status report on the progress of the study will be submitted 
by the Investigator to the IRB per their regulations. 
20.3 Investigator Protocol Adherence  
The Investigator and his/her designees are required to adhere to the protocol.  While 
deviations from the protocol are discouraged, they may be necessary in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to subjects or to facilitate adherence to protocol procedures.  
Emergency deviations  from the protocol that eliminate an apparent immediate  hazard to a 
subject and that are deemed crucial for the safety and well -being of a particular subject may 
be instituted for that subject only.  The Investigator or other attending physician will contact 
the Sponsor as soon as possible  in the case of such a deviation.  These deviations do not 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 78

require pre -approval by the IRB; however, the Sponsor and the IRB must be notified in 
writing as soon as possible after the departure has been made.  In addition, the Investigator 
will document in the subject’s eCRF th e reasons for protocol deviation and the ensuing 
events.  
20.4 Protocol Amendments  
Any additions or changes to the clinical protocol will require a protocol amendment. The 
Amended Clinical Protocol Signature Page will be signed by the protocol signatories.  
Protocol amendments must undergo IRB approval prior to implementation.  Should the ICF 
require changes, the revised ICF must be approved also according to the same procedure.  
20.5 Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits and inspections by the IRB, the 
Sponsor or its designee, government regulatory bodies, and quality assurance groups of all 
study- related documents.   This includes direct access to source documents, regulatory 
documents, data collection instruments, study data, etc.  The Investigator will ensure that all 
study- related facilities (e .g., pharmacy, laboratories, etc.) are maintained in accordance with 
GCP guidelines. 
Participation as an Investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
government regulatory authorities and applicable quality assurance offices. 2.5.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2 vda-cp-03-protocol-1.pdf - Page 79

22. APPENDICES  
22.1 Local Skin Reaction Score   
This score has been modified from a score published in Lebwohl M et al (2012), “ Ingenol 
Mebutate Gel for Actinic Keratosis” , N Engl J Med 2012;366:1010- 9).  
The Local Skin Reaction Score is an assessment of all the skin in the Treatment Field  (not of 
the AK le sions) . At each study visit the Investigator (or designee) will assign a severity score 
to each of the objective and subjective findings listed in the table. For example, if the 
Treatment Field contains vesicles of moderate severity, the number 3 would be placed under 
the field labelled “Vesicles”.  
The Investigator will assess the selected Treatment Field and rate the findings on a 5 point 
scale.  The LSR s core will consist of the sum of all the individual severity scores.

Score  1          
 
The 5 point LSR Score is: 0 = No reaction , 1=Trace reaction , 2= Mild  reaction , 
3=Moderate reaction , and 4=Severe reaction.

22.3 Treatment Field Map Instructions  
This thin, flexible, plastic transparency  sheet  (Section 22.2), with a grid of 1cm x 1cm 
squares printed on the surface , will be used by the Investigator (or designee) to outline the 
Treatm ent Field, enabling consistent counting the AK lesions within the Treatment Field. It is 
also used to prepare the Treatment Field Template (see Treatment Field Template instructions 
Secti on 22.5). 
This tool should be used in the following manner: 
1. Affix a label that includes the subject’s identifier(s) and the visit date near the top of the 
sheet.      
2. Place this transparency over the Treatment Field selected on the subject’s face or scalp.  
3. With a supplied marker, draw the outline of several  facial landmarks (e.g. eyebrows, ear 
helix and/or lobule, moles, scars) on this map. These landmarks will be transferred  
4. Write at the top of the map any additional information that helps orient placement of the 
map. For example, “Left Face” or “Center Scalp”.    
5. Identify the 25 squares that make up the 25 cm2 contingent area (that includes 4 to 8 
discrete non -hyperkeratotic and non- hyperkeratotic AK lesions)  
6. With the supplied marker, outline the outer border of the 25 squares that defines the chosen Treatment Field.

22.5 Treatment Field Template Instructions  
This thin, flexible, plastic blank transparency (Section 22.4) will be used by the Investigator 
(or designee) to prepare a template (stencil) outlining the Treatment Field. This template will 
be used by the subject to precisely locate the Treatment Field and to properly apply the study 
drug. This tool should be prepared in the following manner by the Investigator (or designee):  
1. Take one of the supplied clear Treatment Field Templates and affix a label to the top 
that includes the subject’s identifiers and the date of the visit.  
2. Lay the template on top of the Treatment Field Map of this s ubject.  
3. Trace all the identifying landmarks from the Treatment Field map onto the clear template using the supplied marker. 
4. After the template is removed from the map, the Treatment Field should be precisely cut out of the Treatment Field Template using the supplied safety blade.  
5. At least 4 templates should be made by repeating steps 1 -4.  
6. The map and the templates should each be checked for accuracy on the subject’s Treatment Field. Make sure the template delineates the Treatment Field precisely and doesn’t include a wider area (and different AK lesions) when it is laid flat.  
7. Use this opportunity to demonstrate to the subject the proper positioning of  the 
template on the Treatment Field.  If possible, let the subject use a mirror to observe 
the position of the template over the Treatment Filed.  
8. The Treatment Field Map and one copy of the template should be stored at the site in 
a protective envelope. The template should be used at each visit for counting AK 
lesions, not the map  since the grip marks on the map might obscure or distort the AK 
lesions.  
9. At each visit, at least 2 copies of the Treatment Field Template should be given to the subject for practicing and dosing purposes.

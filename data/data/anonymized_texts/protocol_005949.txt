Amendment 1  14 Nov 2022  
Original Protocol  13 April  2022 
 
Amendment 01  14 Nov 2022  
 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  This amendment results from the FDA “Study 
May Proceed” letter for IND Opening (Number 159876, Reference ID 4981945) dated 
13-MAY -2022, wherein the FDA recommended that the inclusion of women of 
childbearing potential be considered but require the use of highly effective forms of 
contraception, excluding modalities that may have potential DDIs. Additionally, this 
amendment results from Sponsor decisions to include an evaluation of the VH4011499 
tablet formulation for comparison with the existing VH4011499 PiB data and any 
potential perpetrator risks of DDIs associated with CYP3A4 inhibition and induction and 
OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition. An additional optional MAD dosing group (Optional MAD 
Dosing Group 4) is being added and MAD Dosing Group 3 is being required b y the 
Sponsor in response to the inclusion of DDI evaluations. Part 3 of the study was included 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the VH4011499 tablet 
formulation. Lastly, points of clarification have been incorporated throughout  the 
protocol.

partner of child -bearing potential to use a highly 
effective method of contraception.  
 
  
Sponsor  decision to take a 
more conservative 
approach and require 
highly effective 
contraception use in female 
partners of child -bearing 
potential of male 
participants and to rectify a 
discrepancy between 
inclusion criteria #5 and 
Appendix 4.  
Section 5.2 (Exclus ion

VH4011499  ((which are based on  emerging non -clinical 
GLP toxicity data and defined in the SDEC charter) at 
the time of any dose escalation decision.  Sponsor driven decision to 
amend dose escalation 
criteria.   
 
Sponsor driven decision to 
include protocol flexibility to 
adopt the most c urrent 
NOAEL parameters at the 
time of any dose escalation 
decision.  
Section 8.2.2 (Vital 
Signs)  Details of pulse oximetry included as part of risk 
mitigation strategy of midazolam dosing.

1.1. Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  
A Randomized,  Double -Blind  (Sponsor  Unblinded),  Placebo -Controlled  Study  to 
Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Orally Administered  
VH4011499 in Healthy Participants.  
Brief Title:  
VH4011499 First -Time -in-Human -Study.  
Rationale:  
It is estimated that approximately 38 million people are currently living with  HIV/AIDS 
globally. This worldwide epidemic continues  to grow  at a rate of 1.5 million  new 
infections  and causes  0.7 million  deaths  per year. The current paradigm in the treatment 
of HIV -1 involves life -long therapy with multiple ARVs. This dependency on m edical 
therapy requires a need for continuous improvement on the durability, tolerability and 
convenience of all ARV classes. Long - acting injectable versions of drugs are being 
developed to improve convenience by extending  the dosing  interval from every  day to 
every  month or longer. These therapeutic options hold great promise for future treatment 
and represent an emerging paradigm for the treatment and prevention of HIV -1 infection. 
An all long -acting ARV regimen that is dosed every month or longer offers  many 
potential advantages over daily dosed  regimens, including: improved ARV adherence, 
improved treatment satisfaction, and minimizing the patient’s daily reminder of their HIV 
status.  
 
The overall  objective  of the ViiV  CAI clinical  development  program  is to develop 
investigational VH4011499 (also known as GSK4011499) as a long -acting novel  
medicine  that can be administered  via injection  every  month  or longer   
 Either long -acting VH4011499 -containing regimen 
would offer efficacy and safety comparable to currently available daily dosed ARV 
regimens yet improve both treatment adherence and quality of life through its less 
frequent d osing schedule. Of note, VH4011499 is ViiV's second capsid inhibitor in 
clinical development and is preceded by VH4004280 which is currently in Phase 1.  
 
VH4011499 belongs to a novel class of ARV agents targeting a highly conserved region 
of the HIV -1 caps id protein. In -vitro experiments suggest its primary antiviral  mechanism  
of action  is derived  from  inhibition  of a replication  step early  in the viral replication cycle 
prior to integration of the HIV -1 provirus into the host cell chromatin. VH4011499 also  
possesses a less potent late antiviral activity, reducing production of infectious virions 
from virus -producing cells.

Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  There are currently no capsid inhibitors approved for the treatment of HIV  infection, 
although clinical efficacy and a generally  favorable safety  profile has been 
demonstrated in an investigational capsid inhibitor currently in development. In cell 
culture, VH4011499 exhibited potent antiviral activity  against a wide spectrum of HIV -
1 isolates and subtypes and also demonstrated no cross -resistance with currently 
approved ARV classes. The potential to develop VH4011499 as a long-acting medicine 
is further supported  by nonclinical  studies  (including  rat and dog studies  up to 28 days)  
that show  a favorable toxicity, safety and PK profile for VH4011499.  
 
This FTIH study is designed to gain information on the safety, tolerability  and PK 
properties of oral VH4011499 when administered as PiB. This study will also evaluate 
the safety, tolerability and PK properties of VH4011499 when administered as an oral 
tablet. The potential in -vitro based perpetrator risks of DDIs associated with  CYP3A4 
inhibition and induction will also be evaluated by assessing the effect of VH4011499 on 
midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 probe substrate. The potential DDI risks associated 
with OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition will also be evaluated by assessing the effect of 
VH4011499 on an endogenous biomarker as a probe (coproporphyrin I). This study will 
enable further clinical development of VH4011499, including a Phase 2a PoC study in 
HIV-infected participants  and a Phase  1 study  of the long-acting  injectable  formulation  
of VH4011499.

Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  Overall  Design:  
 
Brief  Summary:  
 
This is a double -blind  (sponsor  unblinded),  randomized,  placebo -controlled,  single  
and multiple -ascending -dose Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics of VH4011499, when administered as a PiB formul ation, in 
healthy adult participants. This study will also evaluate the DDI potential of 
VH4011499 for inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 and changes in CYP3A activity, and 
evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of a VH4011499 tablet formulation in 
comparison wit h existing data from VH4011499 PiB. All doses will be administered 
orally. This study will be executed in 3 parts.  
 
In Part 1, the proposed  dosing  schedule  is designed  to investigate  SAD of VH4011499 
in up to 6 dosing groups. In Part 2, the proposed dosing  schedule  is designed to 
investigate MAD  of VH4011499 administered daily, for 14 days in up to 4 dosing 
groups. A midazolam probe will be administered with VH4011499 or placebo in up to 
two dosing groups in Part 2 (MAD/DDI dosing group(s)) to examine  the potential of 
VH4011499 to inhibit or induce CYP3A activity. The MAD/DDI dosing group(s) will 
also include the collection of endogenous biomarker (coproporphyrin I) samples before 
and following repeat dose administration of VH4011499 or placebo to inve stigate the 
potential of VH4011499 to inhibit OATP1B1/1B3. Review of available data from 
previous SAD and emerging MAD dosing groups will determine if the DDI potential of 
VH4011499 will be evaluated in one or two MAD dosing groups.  
 
Part 3 (Tablet PK) is  an open -label, single -dose design to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability and PK properties of the tablet formulation of VH4011499, in comparison 
with existing data from VH4011499 PiB, in one dosing group.  
 
A SDEC  will govern  dose escalation  decisions, incl uding the determination of 
subsequent doses, based on emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data. The SDEC will 
also govern the total duration of dosing and follow -up, which may be altered if actual 
PK parameters (such as half -life) differ significantly from  predicted values.  
 
Number of Participants:  
 
A sufficient number of healthy adults will be screened to provide 8 participants for 
randomization  (6:2 active: placebo)  within  each SAD dosing group.  Within each MAD 
dosing group, up to 8 participants will be r andomized (6:2 active: placebo). Within each 
MAD/DDI dosing group, up to 10 participants will be randomized (8:2 active: placebo). 
Overall,  up to 48 participants (36 active:12 placebo) will be included in Part 1. and up to 
36 participants (28 active:8 plac ebo) will be included in Part 2, in the case that two 
MAD/DDI dosing groups are needed. Up to 6 participants will be included in Part 3 
(Tablet PK).  
 
If participants prematurely discontinue the study, additional replacement participants 
may be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor. Assignment of replacement numbers 
will be detailed in the SRM.

Note : Enrolled means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative’s, 
agreement  to participate  in a clinical  study  following  completion  of the informed  
consent process, passed screening and were randomized in the study . Potential 
participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, 
but do not participate in the study, are not considered enrolled.  
 
Intervention Groups and Duration:  
 
Study participants will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of 
VH4011499 / PBO.  
 
In Part 1 (SAD), participants will receive a single dose of VH4011499 or placebo (6:2) 
on Day 1. Sentinel dosing is included. S afety and PK assessments will be performed at 
timepoints specified in the SoA. Participants will remain in the  
clinic until completion of the Day 7 procedures and will return to the clinic on Days 14 
and 21 for follow up procedures and a final follow up v isit on Day 28.  
 
In Part 2 (MAD) participants will receive doses of VH4011499 or PBO once daily for 
an anticipated 14 -day period. Participants in non -DDI MAD dosing groups will receive 
daily doses of VH4011499 or PBO (6:2) on Day 1 through Day 14 and will remain in 
the clinic until completion of the Day 21 procedures and will return to the clinic on 
Days 28 and 35 for follow up procedures and a final follow up visit on Day 42. In 
MAD/DDI dosing group(s), participants will receive a single dose of midazolam on 
Days 1, 2, and 15, and daily doses of VH4011499 or PBO (8:2) on Day 2 through to 
Day 15. A single dose of midazolam will be co -administered with a dose of 
VH4011499 or PBO on Days 2 and 15. Participants will remain in the clinic until 
completion of the Day 22 procedures and will return to the clinic on Days 28 and 35 
for follow up procedures and a final follow up visit on Day 42.  
 
In Part 3 (Tablet PK), participants will receive a single dose of VH4011499 as a tablet 
formulation on Day 1. The dose of VH 4011499 to be administered in Part 3 will be 
determined based on review of available data from previous dosing groups in Parts 1 
(SAD) and 2 (MAD) and predicted clinical doses. Participants will remain in the clinic 
until completion of the Day 7 procedures  and will return to the clinic on Days 14 and 
21 for follow up procedures and a final follow up visit on Day 28.  
 
If actual PK parameters differ significantly from predicted values (e.g., if half -life is 
significantly longer or shorter than the predicted),  then the duration of in clinic stay, 
duration of post last dose follow -up, determination of subsequent doses, dosing 
frequency and total duration of dosing may be altered. The duration of post dose 
follow -up is not intended to exceed five half -lives.  
Data  Monitoring/ Other Committee: Yes 
 
The study will utilize a SDEC which will include, at a minimum, the Sponsor medical 
monitor, clinical pharmacologist, and statistician to meet with the Investigator to make 
a dose escalation decision. Limited additional S ponsor representatives may be included

Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  2. INTRODUCTION  
VH4011499  (also  referred  to as GSK4011499)  belongs  to a novel  class  of ARV agents 
targeting a highly conserved region of the HIV -1 capsid protein.  
Investigational  VH4011499  is being  developed  for people  living  with HIV-1 to be part of 
a long-acting  ARV  treatment  regimen.  The purpose  of this FTIH  study  with VH4011499 
(via powder -in-bottle) is to initially characterize the tolerability, safety, and 
pharmacokinetics of VH4011499. The drug concentrations obta ined from oral 
administration of VH4011499 in both the single ascending dose and repeat ascending 
dose parts of this study will help inform subsequent development of long -acting 
VH4011499.  
2.1. Study  Rationale  
This is a double -blind,  randomized,  placebo -control led, FTIH  study in a combined single -
ascending (Part 1) and multiple -ascending (Part 2) dose design to assess the tolerability, 
safety  and pharmacokinetics of orally  administered VH4011499 in healthy participants. 
This study is designed to evaluate: the safety, tolerability, and PK properties of 
VH4011499 when administered as single and multiple ascending dosing with the PiB 
formulation; the safety, tolerability and PK properties of the VH4011499 tablet 
formulation; and any effect of VH4011499 on the acti vity of CYP3A using midazolam as 
a probe and on OATP1B1/1B3 using an endogenous biomarker as a probe 
(coproporphyrin I). The data gathered in this study will inform further evaluation of 
VH4011499 in people living with HIV -1 
 
2.2. Background  
It is estimated that approximately 38 million people are currently living with HIV/AIDS 
globally. This worldwide epidemic continues  to grow  at a rate of 1.5 million  new 
infections  and causes  0.7 million  deaths per year  [UNAIDS , 2021].  The current  paradigm  
in the treatment  of HIV-1 involves  life-long therapy with multiple ARVs. While HIV -1 
medicines are effective, there is an opportunity for developing more conveniently dosed 
and better tolerated ARV regimens. Long -acting injectable versions of drugs are being 
developed to improve convenience by extending  the dosing  interval from every  day to 
every  month or longer. These therapeutic options hold great promise for future treatment 
and represent an emerging paradigm for the treatment and prevention of HIV -1 infection. 
An all long -acting ARV regimen that is dosed every month or longer offers many 
potential advantages over dai ly dosed  regimens, including: improved ARV adherence, 
improved treatment satisfaction, and minimizing the patient’s daily reminder of their HIV 
status.  
 
VH4011499 belongs to a novel class of ARV agents targeting a highly conserved region 
of the HIV -1 capsi d protein. In -vitro experiments suggest its primary antiviral mechanism 
of action is derived from inhibition of a replication step early  in the viral replication cycle 
prior to integration of the HIV -1 provirus into the host cell chromatin. VH4011499 also 
possesses a less potent late antiviral activity, reducing production  of infectious  virions  
from  virus -producing  cells [GSK  Document Number RPS-CLIN -026329 ]. Of note,

Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  VH4011499 is ViiV's second capsid inhibitor in clinical  development  and is preceded  by 
VH4004280  which  is currently  in Phase  1 [ViiV  Healthcare Protocol for Study 217058 , 
2022].  
There are currently no capsid inhibitors approved for the treatment of H IV infection, 
although clinical efficacy and a generally  favorable safety  profile has been demonstrated 
in an investigational capsid inhibitor currently in development [ Gupta , 2022; Oguagu , 
2022]. In cell culture, VH4011499 exhibited potent antiviral activity against a wide 
spectrum of HIV -1 isolates and subtypes and also demonstrated no cross -resistance with 
currently approved ARV classes [GSK Document Number RPS-CLIN - 026329 ]. The 
potential to develop VH4011499 as a long -acting medicine is further supported  by 
nonclinical  studies  (including  rat and dog studies  up to 28 days)  that show  a favorable  
toxicity,  safety  and pharmacokinetic  profile  for VH4011499  [GSK Document Number 
RPS-CLIN -026329 ]. 
 
A detailed description of the non -clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, 
virology,  and the chemistry  and manufacturing  of VH4011499  is provided  in the Clinical 
Investigator’s Brochure [GSK Document Number RPS-CLIN -026329 ]. 
 
2.3. Benefit/Risk  Assessment  
In the definitive (GLP) 28 -day repeat dose oral studies in rats and dogs with VH4011499 
, increases in liver enzymes (up 
to 11.3 -fold pre -treatment levels at a mean  
) were observed in dogs at the highest dose tested, which 
was also considered the NOAEL  in this study.  There  were  no histologic  correlates  in the 
liver and no changes  in liver weight in the dogs, and no adverse findings in the definitive 
rat study up to the highest dose and NOAEL  of . There  were  no 
significant findings in GLP non -clinical studies conducted to assess genotoxicity, safety 
pharmacology and phototoxicity.  
 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and 
reasonably  expected  AEs of VH4011499  may be found  in the Clinical Investigator’s 
Brochure [GSK Document Number RPS-CLIN -026329 ]. 
 
Midazolam Probe (Part 2, MAD/DDI dosing group(s)): Based on in vitro data, there is 
potential for inhibition of CYP3A by VH4011499 leading to incr eased midazolam 
exposures and a deeper and more prolonged CNS suppression. There is also potential for 
induction of CYP3A by VH4011499 leading to decreased midazolam exposures. To 
allow for accurate assessment of PK as a result of either CYP3A inhibition o r induction 
while minimizing the risk of serious CNS suppression, a 5 mg oral dose of midazolam 
has been selected for this study. Of note, many drug interaction studies with potent 
CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals including ketoconazole) have been  conducted 
with midazolam doses as high as 15 mg [ Backman  1998; Olkkola , 1994]. Though some 
of these studies have reported deeper or longer sedation, no serious adverse events have 
been reported. Additionally, during dosing with midazolam in the present study, clo se 
observation for signs of CNS suppression as well as pulse oxygenation monitoring and 
timed respiratory rate will be implemented, and flumazenil will be readily available.

  2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment  
 
This is a study in healthy participants and as such there is no expected benefit to 
administration  of VH4011499.  Participation  in this study  may contribute  to the  process  of 
developing new therapies for HIV. There may be benefit to individual participants from 
the medical  evaluations  and assessments  that could  identify  conditions  that the participant 
was previously unaware.  
 
2.3.3.  Overall  Benefit:  Risk  Conclusion  
 
In non-clinical oral studies, increases in liver enzymes were observed, which were not 
accompanied by macroscopic or microscopic findings or weight changes in the liver. The 
increased liver enzymes in animals was observed at systemic exposures that were 244 - 
692 times higher than the predicted clinical efficacious AUC(0 -24) and Cmax. The 
protocol will exclude participants from the study with any pre -existing liver disease and 
all partic ipants will be closely monitored for liver related AEs and laboratory 
abnormalities, with additional monitoring of total bile acids and lipids.  
 
In addition,  consistent  with Sponsor  guidance  for early  phase  studies,  this study  will be 
conducted  in one or more clinical  research  units  with prior  experience  conducting  first- 
time-in-human -trials, sufficient overnight facilities and immediate emergency care 
capabilities. Moreover, part 1 (SAD) must be conducted in a hospital based/adjacent 
inpatient clinical trial unit  
 
ViiV Healthcare  has assessed this study  for any risks that may  be posed to participants 
taking  part. The proposed  risk assessment  and management  plan for the study  has been 
developed in accordance with the tenets of FDA and EMEA guidance on strategies to 
identify and mitigate risks for FTIH clinical trials with investigational medicinal 
products.

ICEs  Discontinuation of study treatment due to any reason, will be 
addressed with treatment policy strategy in Part 2 (discontinuation of 
study treatment can’t occur in Parts 1 or 3 as participants will 
receive only 1 dose). The occurrence of the ICE is considered 
irrelevant in defining the treatment effect of interest. All safety data 
will be included in the analysis up to the end of the follow -up period 
irrespective of the occurrence of this ICE.

  4.  STUDY  DESIGN  
4.1. Overall  Design  
This is a Phase 1, 3 -Part, double -blind (sponsor unblinded), randomized, placebo - 
controlled, single and multiple -ascending -dose study in healthy participants. The purpose 
of this study is to evaluate: the safety, tolerability, and PK properties of VH40114 99 when 
administered as single and multiple ascending dosing with the PiB; the safety, tolerability and 
PK properties of the VH4011499 tablet formulation; and any effect of VH4011499 on the 
activity of CYP3A using midazolam as a probe and on OATP1B1/1B3 us ing an endogenous 
biomarker as a probe (coproporphyrin I). Approximately  90 healthy participants are 
planned to be randomized, in Part 1 (SAD,  n=48), Part 2 (MAD, n=36), and Part 3 
(Tablet PK, n=6) from one or more centers in the US.  
 
All dosing and 7 day  post last -dose in clinic follow -up will be conducted in clinical trial 
units  with experience  in conducting  first-time-in-human  studies  with sufficient  overnight 
facilities and immediate emergency care capabilities. Moreover, Part 1 (SAD) must be 
conducted in a hospital based/adjacent inpatient clinical trial unit. A final follow up 
outpatient visit will take place approximately 28 -days post final dose in Part 1 (SAD), 
Part 2 (MAD), and Part 3 (Tablet PK), as indicated in the Schedule of Activities (SoA), 
Section. 1.3. The 28 -day post final dose follow -up assumes a potential maximum half -life 
of 3-5 days  for VH4011499.  While  the estimated  half-life prior  to starting  the study  is 13 
hours, the actual half -life will be defined as data emerge from the study. The study is 
designed to ensure adequate PK follow -up for all participants. The follow -up duration 
may be altered if the actual half -life is significantly longer or shorter than predicted.  
 
If actual PK parameters differ significantly from predicted values (e.g. if half -life is 
significantly longer or shorter than the predicted), then the duration of in clinic stay, 
duration  of post last dose follow -up, determination  of subsequent  doses,  dosing  frequency 
and total duration of dosing may be altered. The duration of post dose follow -up is not 
intended to exceed five half -lives.  
 
Part 1 (SAD)  will investigate  single  doses  of VH4011499  from  the starting  dose up to a 
maximu m safe dose that provides adequate dose information for future dosing 
requirements in the VH4011499 development program and does not exceed the NOAEL.  
 
A summary  of overall  study  design for Parts 1 and 2,  including  proposed  doses,  sample  
size and order,  is presented in Table 10  (Part 1 SAD) and Table 11 (Part 2 MAD).  
 
4.1.1.  Part 1 (SAD ) 
 
Part 1 (SAD) will be conducted in up to 6 separate dosing groups. Each participant will 
be randomized to receive a single dose of blinded VH4011499 or blinded PBO (in a 6:2, 
active:PBO ratio) administered orally. Details of the starting dose and dose escal ation can 
be found in Section 4.3.2  and Section 4.3.5 , respectively. Do se escalation decisions, 
including the determination of subsequent doses to be administered in Part 1, will be 
determined by the SDEC, see Section  10.1.5  but will be constrained  by any emerging

  safety  or tolerability  concerns  and to a maximum 5x the predicted exposure increase 
between consecutive dosing groups (e.g., dosing group 2 and dosing group 3) where 
predicted VH4011499 concentrations would not exceed mean NOAEL criteria.

1. Doses beyond group 1 will be decided by the SDEC based on emerging PK and safety data  
from prior dosing groups.  
2. Calculated  using the rat  NOAEL  dose. Target  fold coverage  can be revised  based  on emerging  
data. 
3. Dosing groups 5 and 6 are optional expansion groups used to dose escalate up to a maximum 
dose whose predicted  VH4011499  concentrations would not  exceed mean NOAEL criteria or  
other predefined  limits, to repeat a previous dose level, or to dose de -escalate.  
At the start of each SAD dosing group, 2 of the total number of participants will serve as 
sentinel participants, with one receiving blinded VH4011499 and the other receiving 
blinded PBO. The investigator may stagger dose administration time as needed for 
sentinel participants. Sentinel participants will be followed clinically for 24 hours 
following  dose administration  to monitor  for emergence  of adverse  events.  Following  this 
period, if there are  no safety  concerns,  in the judgement  of the PI, on  review  of 24-hour 
safety  data (including  but not limited  to vital signs,  ECGs,  available laboratory  tests and 
adverse events) for sentinel participants, the remaining 6 participants will  be 
subsequently  dosed  with blinded  VH4011499  or blinded  PBO,  according  to the 
randomization schedule. The PI may stagger dose administration time for remaining 
dosing group participants as needed. The 24 -hour clinical observation period for sentinel 
participants  and dose administrat ion in subsequent  participants  may be reduced  following 
completion of dosing group 1, if there are no safety or tolerability concerns.  
 
The proposed  dosing  schedule  is designed  to investigate  single  doses  of VH4011499  in 
Part 1 and then, at a suitable cros s-over point, begin repeated once -daily dosing of 
VH4011499 in Part 2.

  participant will be  randomized to receive a  QD dose of blinded VH4011499 or blinded 
PBO administered orally  for 14 days.  Participants in non -DDI MAD dosing groups will 
receive daily doses of VH4011499  or PBO (6:2) on Day 1 through Day 14. In up to two 
dosing groups in Part 2 (MAD/DDI dosing group(s)), participants will receive a single 
dose o f midazolam on Days 1, 2, and 15, and daily doses of VH4011499  or PBO (8:2) on 
Day 2 through to Day 15. A single dose of midazolam will be co -administered with a dose 
of VH4011499  or PBO on Days 2 and 15. The MAD/DDI dosing group(s) will also 
include the c ollection of endogenous biomarker (coproporphyrin I) samples before and 
following repeat dose administration of VH4011499  or PBO to investigate the potential of 
VH4011499  to inhibit OATP1B1/1B3. Review of available data from previous SAD and 
emerging MAD d osing groups will determine if the DDI potential of VH4011499  will be 
evaluated in one or two MAD dosing groups.  
 
The starting  dose in Part 2 (MAD)  will be identified  after preliminary PK data are 
evaluated in Part 1 (SAD).  
 
For both Parts 1 and 2, doses  will be escalated such that the predicted mean plasma  
exposure at the next dose level will not exceed the mean plasma Cmax and AUC  
observed at the NOAEL exposures defined in Section 4.3.3 . See  Section 4.3 for further  
details  on dose predictions.

2. Actual doses will be decided based on emerging PK and safety data from prior dosing 
groups in Part 1 and Part 2.  
3. Dosing Groups 3 and 4 are optional expansion groups used to dose escalate of up to a maximum 
dose (whose predicted VH4011499 concentrations wou ld not exceed the permitted top dose based 
on emerging data and safety cover), to repeat a previous dose level, or to dose de -escalate.  
Details of the starting dose and dose escalation can be found in Section 4.3.6 .  Dose 
escalation decisions, including the determination of subsequent doses, dosing frequency 
and total duration  of dosing  to be administered  in Part 2, will be determined  by the SDEC 
(see Section 10.1.5 ). 
 
4.1.3.  Part 3 (Tablet PK)  
 
Part 3 (Tablet PK) is an open -label, single -dose design to evaluate the safety, tolerability 
and PK properties of the tablet formulation of VH4011499, in comparison with existing 
data from VH4011499 PiB, in one dosing group of 6 participants. All participa nts will 
receive a single dose of the VH4011499 tablet on Day 1 and will remain in the clinic 
until completion of the Day 7 procedures. They will return to the clinic on Days 14 and 
21 for follow up procedures and a final follow up visit on Day 28.  
 
Detai ls of the VH4011499 tablet dose can be found in Section 4.3.7 . While there is only 
one dosing group in Part 3, the study will utilize a SDEC for instream review of  emerging 
PK and safety data.  
 
4.1.4.  Screening,  Follow -up & Study  Participation  Duration  
 
Participants  in all parts of the study will have  a screening  visit within  30 days prior to 
their first dose and a final follow up visit approximately 28 -days following fina l dose in 
Part 1 (SAD), Part 2 (MAD), and Part 3 (Tablet PK). Duration of  study  participation

Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  TMF-14909676  CONFIDENTIAL  
 218490  
 Protocol Amendment 01    
  (from the Screening Visit to the final post -dosing Follow -up Visit) will be approximately 
8 weeks for participants in Part 1 (SAD) and Part 3 (Tablet PK), and app roximately 10 
weeks for participants in Part 2 (MAD)  
 
Duration of study participation may change, if actual PK parameters differ significantly 
from  the predicted  base case values  (e.g.,  if half-life is significantly  longer  or shorter  than 
the predicted).  
 
Participants  will not be replaced  if the reason  for discontinuation  from  the study  is due to 
a safety  concern. If  participants  prematurely  discontinue  the study  for non-safety  reasons 
or intolerance to ingestion of the study drug (e.g., vomiting the soluti on shortly after 
ingestion and/or intentionally choosing to not ingest the full dose because of participant 
preference issues such as taste or smell), additional replacement participants may be 
enrolled at the  discretion of  the sponsor  and investigator. Th ese replacement participants 
will be assigned to the same treatment sequence and same dose as the corresponding  
participant  who prematurely  discontinued  from  the study.  Participants  who are withdrawn 
from the study due to COVID -19 infection (including exposure to COVID -19) may be 
replaced based upon the discretion of the sponsor and investigator.  
 
4.2. Scientific  Rationale  for Study  Design  
This FTIH  study,  conducted  in healthy  adult  participants,  is designed  to assess  the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of an o ral powder formulation of VH4011499, an investigational 
HIV-1 capsid  inhibitor.  The data gathered  within  this FTIH  study  will inform  subsequent 
clinical trials, including a follow -on Phase 2a POC study  in HIV -1-infected participants. 
Clinical development p lans for the VH4011499 compound, include studies with 
parenterally administered (subcutaneous and intramuscular) versions of the molecule.  
 
 Part 3 (Tablet PK) is 
planned to evaluate the VH4011499 tablet formulation for comparison with the existing 
VH4011499 PiB data and will inform subsequent clinical trials.  
 
All doses  of VH4011499  in this oral FTIH  study  will be administered  in the fed state (see 
Section 5.3.1  for details of moderate fat/calorie meal) with dosing starting after  5 minutes 
of completing a standardized moderat e fat/calorie meal, unless otherwise indicated.  
 
In Part 2 of the study  (MAD),  doses  will exceed  the anticipated  effective  dose in a daily 
oral regimen in order to study exposures that may occur in future clinical studies with 
alternative routes, formulations and dosing durations. This will be done without 
exceeding the NOAEL established in non -clinical toxicology studies.  
 
4.3. Justification  for Dose  
This section  describes  the analyses  conducted  to estimate  human  VH4011499  PK profile, 
and to predict st arting, top and anticipated therapeutic doses required to maintain plasma 
concentrations at levels expected to produce pharmacologic activity in HIV -1 infected 
subjects.

4.3.1.  Human  Pharmacokinetics  Prediction  
 
The pharmacokinetics of VH4011499 in human was estimated using several approaches 
to determine a range of starting, therapeutic and top doses to achieve the objectives of 
this study.  The methods  utilized  were  allometry,  PBPK,  FDA  guidance  on maximum  safe 
starting dose and the analysis of data from lena capavir, a molecule in the clinic with the 
same pharmacology. These approaches were used to anticipate VH4011499 clinical PK 
and/or estimate a safe starting dose. The details of each method are described in the 
Human Prediction Report [GSK Document Number TMF -14580566 ]. 
 
4.3.2.  Starting  Dose  Rationale in  Part 1 (SAD)  
 
The proposed  starting  dose was based  on a range  of approaches  including  the anticipated 
therapeutic dose predictions and MRSD assessments. Guidance for Industry estimating 
the maximum safe starting dose in initial clinical trials for therapeutics in adult healthy 
volunteers. FDA/CDER, July 2005.  
 
The NOAEL doses identified from the 28 -day GLP rat and dog studies were  
 and , respectively.  The  
 based on the respective rat and dog 
NOAEL  doses.  A 10-fold safety  factor  on the HEDs  yields  an approximate  MRSD  of 
. 
 
The estimated  starting  doses  using  allometry  and additional  approaches  are summarized 
in Table 12 .

The resulting starting dose of VH4011499 in part 1 (SAD) is 25 mg. This reflects a 
mitigation of any potential safety risks (e.g., elevated liver chemistries) to the clinical 
study  participants,  since  this is the first time that VH4011499  will be dosed  in man and

  safety outcomes are uncertain.  
 
The predicted  exposures  (based  on an allometric  PK model)  of the proposed  starting  dose 
of 25 mg for

4.3.3.  Top Dose  Rationale  
 
The top dose is defined  as the highest  dose where  the predicted mean plasma exposures at 
that dose level (either  SAD  or MAD ) approaches but does not exceed the mean NOAEL 
exposures ( ). For both 
Parts 1 and 2, the predicted mean plasma exposure at the top dose levels will not exceed 
the mean plasma Cmax and AUC observed at the NOAEL exposures.  
 
The predicted  top dose of  administered  as a single  dose is estimated  to provide  a 
median plasma  
 
. And the top dose will be reviewed based on the 
emerging human PK data from the initial low dosing groups studied.  
 
4.3.4.  Anticipated  Therapeutic  Dose  Rationale  
 
Steady -state trough concentrations are typically the PK parameter of interest for effica cy 
for other antiretroviral classes such as protease inhibitors and integrase inhibitors. A 
therapeutic dose is proposed as where

Estimates of concentration at the end of a dosing interval at steady state (C τ) from 
allometric scaling resulted in a dose range  
. This dose range is expect ed to  
. The PBPK and evaluation of existing clinical 
data used the same efficacy thresholds and the estimated doses are reported in Table 14  
Using  clinical  LEN  data as a relative  benchmark,  an equivalent  VH4011499  maintenance 
dose is estimated to be  based on the .

4.3.5.  Planned  Doses  and Safety  Coverage  (Part  1) 
 
Dose  escalations  in Part 1 (SAD)  will be governed  in real-time by PK and safety  stopping 
criteria (see Section 7.4.1  and Section 7.4.2 ). Doses following the first dose will be 
curtailed by responses to any safety, to lerance or other data, and predicted not to exceed 
mean NOAEL, and within a maximum 5x exposure increase. De -escalation of a dose or 
repeat of a dose level is permitted, if needed.  
 
Based on the assumptions described above and PK predictions made with the allometry 
model,  possible  dose escalations  are illustrated  below  in Table  15. These  dose elevations 
and maximum SAD dose will be revised based on emerging PK and safety data. The 
proposed number of cohorts for Part 1 (SAD) is 4 with a further 2 for possible expansions

4.3.6.  Repeat  Dosing  Plan  (Part  2) 
 
The planned  dosing  regimen  for Part 2 is QD (24h dosing  intervals)  for 14 days,  judged 
sufficient to evaluate accumulation, repeat dosing PK and be able to evaluate future 
steady state exposures.  
 
Part 2 (MAD) will be conducted in up to 4 ascending repeat -dose groups and each 
escalation is expected  to be within 3x exposure increase. The  top dose is defined  as the 
highest  dose where  the predicted mean plasma exposures at that dose level approaches 
but does not exceed the mean NOAEL exposures (  
). 
Dose  escalation  in the MAD  will be governed  by both MAD  PK and safety  stopping 
criteria (see Section 7.4.1  and Section 7.4.2 ). 
 
4.3.7.  Tablet PK (Part 3) Dose  Selection   
 
In Part 3, the safety, tolerability and PK of the VH4011499 tablet formulation will be 
evaluated in comparison with existing data from VH4011499 PiB. A tablet dose will be 
determined as a reasonable representative dose for this assessment, based on review of 
available data from previous dosing groups in Parts 1(SAD) and 2 (MAD) and predicted 
clinical doses.  
 
4.4. End of Study  Definition  
The end of the study is  defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the 
study. A participant is considered to have completed the study  if he/she has completed 
the entire  dosing  period  and post dosing  follow -up period,  including  the final follow  up 
visit, as detailed in the SoA (Section 1.3).

dosing group) until 2 weeks after discharge from the inpatient unit.  Participants  also 
should  abstain  from  ingesting  caffeine -or xanthine -containing products 24 hours prior to 
all remaining outpatient study visits until the end of that visit.  
Use of alcohol  or tobacco  products  will not be allowed  from  screening  until after the final 
follow -up visit.  
 
5.3.3.  Activity  
Participants  will abstain  from  strenuous  exercise  for 48 hours  before  each blood collection 
for clinical laboratory tests. Participants may participate in light recreational activities 
during studies (e.g., watching television, reading).  
 
5.4. Screen  Failures  
A screen  failure  occurs  when  a participant  who consents  to participate  in the clinical study  
is not subsequently  randomized.  A minimal  set of screen  failure  information  is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of s creen failure participants to meet the  
CONSORT  publishing  requirements  and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility 
criteria, any protocol deviations and any SAEs.  
 
Any individual  who meets  eligibility  criteria is permitted  to rescreen.  
 
With one exception, individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this 
study (screen failure) may not be rescreened. Participants previously deemed eligible

 Protocol Amendment 01    
   
6.2. Preparation,  Handling,  Storage  and Accountability  
• The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate conditions (e.g., temperature) 
have  been  maintained  during  transit  for all study  drug received  and any discrepancies 
are reported and resolved before use of the study drug.  
• Only  participants  enrolled  in the study  may receive  study  drug and only authorized 
site staff may supply, prepare, or administer study drug.  
• All study  drugs  must  be stored  in a secure,  environmentally  controlled,  and monitored  
(manual  or automated)  area in accordance  with the labeled  storage  conditions  with 
access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  
• The investigator,  institution,  or the head  of the medical  institution  (where  applicable)  
is responsible  for study  drug accountability,  reconciliation,  and record  maintenance 
(i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
• Further  guidance and  information  for the final dispo sition  of unused  study  drug are 
provided  in the Study  Reference  Manual.  
• Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study drug is not expected 
to pose significant  safety  risks  to site staff.  Take  adequate  precautions  to avoid  direct 
eye or skin  contact and the generation of aerosols or mists. In the case of 
unintentional occupational exposure notify the monitor, Sponsor medical monitor 
and/or VH/GSK study contact. A MSDS/equivalent document describing 
occupational hazards and recommended handlin g precautions  
either  will be provided  to the investigator,  where  this is required  by local  laws,  or is available 
upon request from VH/GSK.  
6.3. Measures  to Minimize  Bias:  Randomization  and Blinding  
All participants  will be randomized,  according  to the randomization  schedule  generated 
prior to the study by the Biostatistics Department at GSK using validated internal 
software. Each participant in Part 1 and Part 2 will be dispensed blinded study drug, 
labelled with his/her unique randomization number, thr oughout the study. Each 
participant scheduled to receive study drug will receive a treatment allocation number 
when randomized.  
 
Parts 1 and 2 will  be partially  blinded.  The blinding  strategy  is structured  to ensure  that 
no one who is involved in the manag ement of individual participants is unblinded to 
treatment at the participant level.  
 
• Participants  will be blinded  to their treatment.  
• Site staff will be blinded  with the exception  of the unblinded  pharmacist  who will 
prepare the study drug.  
• The Sponsor will be blinded with the exception of the statistician and clinical 
pharmacologist who  will have  access  to unblinded data.  The Sponsor’s  unblinded

 Protocol Amendment 01    
  Clinical Research Associate, and in the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the 
auditor(s), will be allowed a ccess to unblinded study drug records at the site to verify 
that randomization/dispensing has been done accurately. The Sponsor will present 
data at SDEC meetings in a fashion that preserves the blinding of individual  
participants.  Other  Sponsor  staff will remain  blinded  unless  unblinding becomes 
absolutely necessary.  
The blind may be broken if, in the opinion of the Investigator, it is in the participant’s 
best interest for the investigator to know the study treatment assignment. The Sponsor 
study team mus t be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study 
treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific 
blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant’s 
condition. In  this case, the Sponsor study team must be notified within 24 hours after 
breaking  the blind.  The date and reason  that the blind  was broken  must  be recorded  in the 
source documentation and eCRF, as applicable.  
A participant  will be withdrawn  if the participant’s  intervention  code  is unblinded  by the 
investigator or treating physician. The primary reason for discontinuation (the event or 
condition which led to the unblinding) will be recorded in the CRF.  
 
GSK’s GCSP staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant with an 
SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more 
regulatory agencies, a copy of the report,  identifying  the participant’s  intervention  
assignment,  may be sent to investigators in acc ordance with local regulations and/or GSK 
policy.  
 
6.4. Study  Intervention  Compliance  
When the individual dose for a participant is prepared from a bulk supply, the preparation 
of the dose will be confirmed by a second member of the study site staff.  
Participants will receive study drug directly from the investigator or designee, under 
medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be 
recorded in the source documents. The dose of study drug and study participant 
identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff 
other than the person administering the study drug. Study site staff will examine each 
participant’s mouth to ensure that the study drug was ingested.  
6.5. Dose  Modification  
The decision  to proceed  to the next dose level  of VH4011499  in both Part 1 (SAD)  and 
Part 2 (MAD) will be made by the SDEC as outlined in the SDEC Charter, based on 
safety, tolerability and PK data obtained from the prior dose level(s).

6.6. Continued Acces s to Study Intervention after the End of the 
Study  
This study  will enrol  healthy  participants  only,  therefore,  no additional  treatment  from  the 
Sponsor, including treatment with VH4011499, will be provided after study completion.  
 
6.7. Treatment  of Overdose  
ViiV Healthcare  does not recommend  specific  treatment  for an overdose. In the event of 
an overdose, the investigator should:  
• Contact  the Sponsor  medical  monitor  immediately.  
• Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities to the 
planned  end of sampling  (at least 21 days after the last dose)  or until VH4011499  can 
no longer be detected systemically  (if the follow -up monitoring  is extended based on 
emerging data).  
• Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis immediately if requested by th e Sponsor 
medical  monitor  (determined  on a case-by-case basis).  Additional  PK samples  over 
time may be requested.  
• Document  the quantity  of the excess  dose as well as the duration  of the overdosing  in 
the CRF.  
Decisions  regarding  dose interruptions  or modifications will  be made  by the investigator 
in consultation  with the Sponsor  medical  monitor,  based  on the clinical  evaluation  of the 
participant. No dose modifications are permitted without prior discussion and consent 
from the SDEC.  
 
6.8. Concomitant  Therapy  
The drug -drug interaction potential of VH4011499 has been evaluated in a series of in 
vitro studies [GSK Document Number RPS-CLIN -026329 ]. As the clinical ris k of 
significant drug -drug interactions with VH4011499 as a perpetrator or a victim is 
currently unknown, participants in this study must abstain from taking concomitant 
medications. To this end, participants must abstain from taking prescription or non - 
prescription drugs (including vitamins, recreational drugs, and dietary or herbal 
supplements) within 7 days or 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) before the start of study 
drug until completion  of the follow -up visit,  unless,  in the opinion  of the investig ator and 
sponsor, the medication will not interact with VH4011499 and interfere with the study.  
 
Permitted  medication(s):  
 
• Paracetamol/Acetaminophen,  at doses  of  2 grams/day,  is permitted  for 
use any time during the study.  
• In the event  of irritation from  ECG  leads,  up to 2.5%  topical  hydrocortisone may  be

  used at the discretion  of the investigator  
• Vaccination with an approved vaccine for SARS -CoV -2 prior to or 
during study participation  (see SRM  for detailed  guidance  on acceptable  
timing  for vaccination)  
• Other  concomitant  medications  may be considered  on a case-by-case basis  by the 
investigator  in consultation  with the Sponsor  medical  monitor.  
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins,  and/or  herbal  supplements)  that the participant  is receiving  at the time of 
enrollment or receives during the study must be reviewed with the Study Sponsor 
Medical Monitor. The following details should be recorded:  
 
• reason  for use 
• dates  of administration  including  start and end dates  
• dosage  information including  dose and frequency

  7.  DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY  INTERVENTION  AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
Discontinuation  of specific  sites or of the study  as a whole  are detailed  in Appendix 1: 
Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations  
 
7.1. Discontinuation  of Study  Intervention  
In rare instances, it may be necessary  for a participant to permanently  discontinue study 
drug. If study  drug is permanently  discontinued, every  attempt will be made to continue 
follow -up data collection for the participant, assuming that the participant continues to 
provide  consent  to participate  in the study. In  most  cases,  the SoA should  continue  to be 
followed for participants that have discontinued study drug. The investigator should 
discus s each specific case with the medical monitor and agree which post dose 
assessments will not be performed (e.g., intensive PK and ECGs on Day 14 or Day 15 
and bile collection  on Day 13 or Day 14  may become  less informative  and therefore  not 
done).  See the SoA (Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of 
study drug and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  
 
7.1.1.  Liver  Chemistry  Stopping  Criteria  
 
Liver  chemistry  stopping,  and increased  monitoring  criteria  have  been  designed  to 
assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology.  
 
Discontinuation  of study  drug for abnormal  liver tests is required  when:  
• a participant  meets one  of the  conditions  outlined  in the algorithm  or 
• in the presence  of abnormal  liver chemistry  not meeting  protocol -specified  stopping 
rules, if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant.  
Study  drug will be discontinued for a participant  if liver chemistry  stopping  criteria  are 
met:

Abbreviations:  ALT  = alanine  transaminase;  INR = international  normalized  ratio;  SAE  = 
serious  adverse event; ULN = upper limit of normal.  
 
Refer  to Appendix  5: Liver  Safety:  Required  Actions  and Follow -up Assessments  for 
required Liver Safety Actions and Follow up Assessments.  
 
7.1.2.  QTc Stopping  Criteria  
 
A participant  that meets either  bulleted  criterion  based  on the average  of triplicate  ECG 
readings will be withdrawn from study drug. See Section 8.2.3 . 
 
• QTcF  >500  msec,  
• Change  from  baseline:  QTc >60 msec  
If a clinically  significant  finding  is identified  (including,  but not limited  to changes  from 
baseline in QTcF ≤60 msec) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will 
determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in participant 
management  is needed.  This review  of the ECG  printed  at the  time of collection  must  be 
documented. Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an AE.  
 
7.1.3.  SARS -COV -2 Stopping  Criteria  
 
A participant must be withdrawn from study drug and discontinued from the study if 
he/she  is found  to have  SARS -CoV -2 infection  during  an inpatient  stay. The management 
of all other inpatient participants within the same dosing group should be discussed by  
the investigator and the medical monitor. Individua ls who have not been exposed to the 
virus will be permitted to remain in the clinic and fulfil their inpatient stay.  Individuals 

66 
Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  TMF-14909676  CONFIDENTIAL  
 218490  
 Protocol Amendment 01    
  who have been exposed will be discharged home regardless of whether they are 
symptomatic. Individuals who are discharged home m ay still be able to continue in the 
study at the discretion of the investigator and the medical monitor assuming the  
participant adheres to current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for 
exposure and assuming the participant continues to h ave a negative SARS -CoV -2 test 
status.  Participants  who test positive  during  the outpatient  phase  of the trial may proceed 
in the study at the discretion of the investigator and sponsor assuming the participant 
isolates according to current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and 
then has a repeat SARS -CoV -2 test that is negative.  
 
Participants who are withdrawn from the study  due to COVID -19 infection (including 
exposure  to COVID -19) may be replaced  based  upon  the discretion  of the spons or and 
investigator.  
 
7.1.4.  Temporary  Discontinuation  
 
Temporary  discontinuation  of study  drug for a study  participant  in this study  is not 
allowed.  
 
7.1.5.  Rechallenge  
 
Study  treatment  restart  or rechallenge  in this study  is not allowed.  
 
7.1.5.1.  Study  Intervention  Restart  or Rechallenge  after  liver stopping  criteria 
met 
 
Study  drug restart  or rechallenge  after liver chemistry  stopping  criteria  are met by any 
participant in this study are not allowed.  
 
7.2. Participant  Discontinuation /Withdrawal  from  the Study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, or 
compliance reasons. This is expected to be uncommon.  
Participants will not be replaced if the reason  for discontinuation from the study is due to 
a safety concern. If participants prematurely discontinue the study for non - safety  reasons  
or intolerance  to ingestion  of the study  drug (i.e., vomiting  the solution shortly after 
ingestion), additional replac ement participants may be enrolled at the discretion of the 
sponsor and investigator. These replacement participants will be assigned to the same 
treatment sequence and same dose as the corresponding participant who prematurely 
discontinued from the study  
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit 
should be conducted, as shown in the SoA  (Section  1.3) for data to be collected  at the 
time of study discontinuation.

Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  TMF-14909676  CONFIDENTIAL  
 218490  
 Protocol Amendment 01    
  If the participant  withdraws  consent  for disclosure  of future  information,  the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples  
taken  and not tested,  and the investigator  must  document  this in the site study records.  
 
7.3. Lost  to Follow  Up 
A participant  will be considered  lost to follow -up if he/she  repeatedly  fails to return  for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
 
The following  actions  must  be taken  if a participant  fails to return  to the clinic  for a 
required study visit:  
 
• The site must attempt to contact the participa nt and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned  visit schedule  and ascertain  whether  the participant  wishes  to and/or  should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed  lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must 
make  every  effort  to regain  contact  with the participant  (where  possible,  3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent meth ods). These  contact attempts should be documented 
in the participant’s medical record.  
• Should  the participant  continue  to be unreachable,  he/she  will be considered  to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
7.4. Study  Pausing  and/or  Stopping  Criteria  
 
7.4.1.  PK Stopping  Criteria  for SAD  and MAD  
 
Assuming that safety stopping criteri a have not been met ( See Section 7.4.2 )  and the top

 Protocol Amendment 01    
  dose in MAD has not already been achieved ( See Section 4.3.6), dose escalation in Part 2 
(MAD) will be stopped in the event that safety or PK stopping criteria are not met, but 
the Bayesian  predicted  probability  is >50% that  any participant's Cmax or AUC 0-24 on the 
day of the last dose in the subsequent dose will exceed the MAD PK stopping criteria.  At 
the time of any dose escalation decision, the most current NOAEL parameters for 
VH4011499 (which are based on emerging non -clinical toxicity data and defined in the 
SDEC c harter) will be used and will not be exceeded.  
 
7.4.2.  Clinical  Criteria  for Pausing  and/or Stopping  the Study  
 
Cumulative safety parameters and all available pharmacokinetic parameters from 
previous dosing cohorts will be fully assessed by the SDEC before select ing the 
subsequent  dose to be used within  the next dosing  cohort in Parts 1 and 2.  Any trends  
toward  drug-related laboratory changes or other safety events will be fully evaluated. The 
decision to dose - escalate will be based on the nature, severity, and f requency of any 
safety and/or tolerability observations. The decision to dose -escalate may be delayed to 
allow the collection of additional safety data, if clinically indicated. While there is only 
one dosing group in Part 3, the study will utilize the SDE C for instream review of 
emerging data. All available safety parameters and pharmacokinetic parameters through 
at least Day 7 will be fully assessed by the SDEC and any trends toward drug -related 
laboratory changes or other safety events will be fully eval uated.  
 
If the following number of participants, within the ongoing cohort of active participants,  
develops  clinically  significant  changes  in safety  parameters  or significant AEs thought to 
be drug related, the dose escalation will be paused until all of the cumulative safety data 
are reviewed by the SDEC and the VSLC. The VSLC is comprised of senior 
representatives from various departments, including clinical development, toxicology, 
pharmacovigilance, epidemiology, and medical affairs.  
 
• Death  of one participant, regardless  of causality  assessment.  
• One participant  experiences  a Grade  4 AE or an SAE  (of any grade)  that the 
Investigator considers reasonably attributable to VH4011499.  
• Two participants (within the same dosing group) experience a ≥Grade 3 A E of the 
same  type that the Investigator  considers  reasonably  attributable  to VH4011499  and 
which leads to a decision to withdraw from the study (by Investigator or subject 
request).  
• Two participants (within the same dosing group) have ≥Grade 2 intensity rash with 
systemic  symptoms  (e.g. fever,  liver transaminase  elevation  and/or  eosinophilia)  that 
the Investigator considers reasonably attributable to VH4011499.  
• Two participants (within the same dosing group) have a Grade 4 laboratory 
abnormality of the sa me type (regardless of causality assessment) or a Grade 3 
laboratory  abnormality  of the same  type which  the Investigator  considers  reasonably 
attributable to VH4011499. Excluded from this are asymptomatic changes in lipid 
panel or creatine kinase changes w ith an alternative aetiology.

  • Two participants  (within  the same  dosing  group)  meeting  liver stopping  criteria  (see 
Section 7.1.1) 
• Two participants  (within  the same  dosing  group)  with confirmed  QTcF  >500  msec  or 
a change from baseline of QTcF >60 msec  
• One sentinel  participant  (who  received  VH4011499)  meeting  any individ ual stopping 
criteria (see Section 7.1). 
• Two participants  (within  the same  dosing  group)  with clinically  significant 
arrhythmias (Investigator judgment).

  8. STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  AND  PROCEDURES  
Study  procedures and  their timing  are summarized  in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to det ermine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
study drug.  
Adherence  to the study  design  requirements,  including  those  specified  in the SoA 
(Section 1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
Results that could unblind the study will not be reported to the investigative site or other 
blinded personnel until the study has b een unblinded.  
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of 56 
days, including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 500 mL.  
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for tech nical issues 
with the samples.  
 
8.1. Efficacy  and/or  Immunogenicity  Assessments  
 
Not applicable.  
 
8.2. Safety  Assessments  
 
Planned timepoints for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA  (Section  1.3). 
 
8.2.1.  Physical  Examinations  
 
A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Height and weight 
will also be measured and recorded.  
A brief/targeted physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen).  
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical s igns related to previous serious 
illnesses.

Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  TMF-14909676  CONFIDENTIAL  
 218490  
 Protocol Amendment 01    
  8.2.2.  Vital Signs  
Single  temperature,  pulse  rate, respiratory  rate, and blood  pressure  will be assessed. Body 
temperature measurements should be assessed according to site standard  and should be 
measured at the same anatomical location throughout the study. Pulse oximetry will be 
assessed following each dose of midazolam (in Part 2, MAD/DDI dosing group(s)  (See 
SoA, Section 1.3)). 
 
Blood  pressure  and pulse  measurements  will be assessed  in a semi -supine  position with a 
completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated 
device is not available.  
 
Blood  pressure  and pulse  measurements  should  be preceded  by at least 5 minutes of rest 
for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, cell phones).  
Vital  signs  (to be taken  before  blood  collection  for laboratory  tests)  will consist  of body 
temperature, single pulse rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure measurement. If 
abnormalities in pulse or blood pressure are noted, repeat recordings should be measured 
in triplicate, at least 1 minute apart. The average of the 3 readings will be recorded on the 
CRF.  
 
8.2.3.  Electrocardiogr ams 
 
8.2.3.1.  12-lead Safety  ECGs  
 
12-lead ECG  recordings  will be obtained  after the participant  has been  in a semi -supine 
position for at least 5 minutes using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the 
heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals.  Participant eligibility  will be 
based upon triplicate ECG recordings. Single recordings will be made at all other time 
points.  
 
Single 12 -lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3) using an ECG  
machine  that automatically  calculates  the heart  rate and measures  PR, QRS,  QT, and QTc 
intervals. Refer to Section 7.1.2 for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc readings 
that may be necessary.  
If the Investigator determines an ECG abnormality as clinically significant or is unable to 
determine the signific ance of abnormalities relating to rate, rhythm  or intervals  (including 
prolongation of the QT interval), then ECGs should be repeated in triplicate with 
recordings over a 5- minute time period.   Refer  to Section  7.1.2 QTc Stopping  Criteria  for 
QTc withdrawal  criteria  and additional QTc readings that may be necessary.  
When  triplicate  ECGs  are required,  3 individual  ECG  tracings  should  be obtained  as 
closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart.  
Safety ECGs may be printed from the Holter device. ECG parameters from safety ECGs 
will not be collected unless as part of an observed adverse event.

8.2.4.  Clinical  Safety  Laboratory  Tests  
 
See Appendix  2: Clinical  Laboratory  Tests  for the list of clinical  laboratory  tests to be 
performed  and the SoA (Section 1.3) for the timing and frequency.  
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any  
clinically  significant  changes  occurring  during  the study  as an AE. The laboratory reports 
must be filed with the source documents.  
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation  in the study  or within 21  days after  the last dose of study  drug should  be 
repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer  considered 
significantly abnormal by the investigator or Sponsor medical monitor.  
If clinically  significant values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of  time 
judged  reasonable  by the investigator,  the etiology  should  be identified and the sp onsor 
notified.  
All protocol -required  laboratory  tests,  as defined  in Section  10.2, must  be conducted in 
accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA (Section 1.3). 
If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory tests performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
considered  clinically  significant  by the investigator  (e.g.,  SAE  or AE) then the results 
must be recorded).  
 
 
8.2.5.  Pregnancy  Testing  
Refer to Section 5.1 Inclusion Criteria for pregnancy testing entry criteria.

  Pregnancy testing (urine or serum as required by local regulations) should be conducted 
at weekly intervals during study intervention period.  
Pregnancy testing (urine or serum as required by local regulations) should be conducted 
at the end of relevant systemic exposure and correspond with the time frame for female 
participant contraception in Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria  
Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined necessary by 
the investigator or required by local regulation, to establish the absence of pregnancy at 
any time during the participant’s participation in the study.  
Pregnancy  testing  will be performed  on all female  participants  at screening  for eligibility 
but will not be required throughout the conduct of the study for female participants 
considered WON CBP since, to be eligible, they must be of non -childbearing potential.  
 
 
8.3. Adverse Events  (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and 
Other Safety Reporting  
The definitions  of AEs or SAEs  can be found  in Section 10.3. 
The definitions  of unsolicited  and solicited  adverse  events  can be found  in Section 10.3. 
AEs will be reported by the participant.  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, 
and recording  events  that meet  the definition  of an AE or SAE  and remain  responsible  for 
following  up all AEs that are  serious, considered related to any  study  drug (including 
midazolam)  or the  study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study (Section 
7). 
 
The method  of recording,  evaluating,  and assessing  causality  of AEs and SAEs  and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3. 
 
8.3.1.  Time  Period  and Frequency  for Collecting  AE and SAE 
Information  
 
All SAEs  will be collected  from  the signing  of the ICF until the final follow -up visit 
specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
All AEs will be collected  from  the start of intervention  until the final follow -up visit.  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study drug but after obtaining informed  
consent  will be recorded  as medical  history/current  medical  conditions  not as AEs.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately  and under  
no circumstance  should  this exceed  24 hours,  as indicated  in Appendix 3 : AEs and SAEs: 
Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting . The 
investigator will submit any updated SAE  data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
74 
Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  TMF-14909676  CONFIDENTIAL

 Protocol Amendment 01    
  available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after 
conclusion  of the study  participation.  However,  if the investigator  learns  of any SAE, 
including a death, at any t ime after a participant has been discharged from the study, the 
investigator must record it in the medical records.  If the investigator considers the event 
to be reasonably related to the study drug or study participation, the investigator must 
promptly no tify the sponsor.  
 
8.3.2.  Method  of Detecting  AEs and SAEs  
 
Care  will be taken  not to introduce  bias when  detecting  AEs and/or  SAEs.  Open -ended and 
nonleading  verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  
 
8.3.3.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
 
After  the initial  AE/SAE  report,  the investigator  is required  to proactively  follow  each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is 
resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant  is lost to follow -up (as 
defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Section 
10.3. 
 
8.3.4.  Regulatory  Reporting Requirements  for SAEs  
 
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that 
legal  obligations  and ethical  responsibilities  towards  the safety  of participants  and the 
safety of a study drug under clinical investigation are met.  
• The sponsor  has a legal  responsibility  to notify  both the local  regulatory  authority  and 
other  regulatory  agencies  about  the safety  of a study  drug under  clinical  investigation. 
The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to 
safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators.  
• An investigator  who receives  an investigator  safety  report  describing  an SAE  or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to l ocal requirements.  
o Investigator  safety  reports  must  be prepared  for SUSARs according to local regulatory 
requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.

  8.3.5.  Pregnancy  
 
In Parts 1 and 3, female participants who become pregnant after administration of the 
study intervention may continue the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
In Part 2, female participants who become pregnant after the first study intervention do se 
must not receive subsequent doses of the study intervention but may continue other study 
procedures at the discretion of the investigator.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
drug and until 58 day s after the last dose of study drug.  
Details of all pregnancies in female partners of male participants will be collected after 
the start of study drug and until 118 days after the last dose taken by the male participant.  
 
If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator will record pregnancy  information on the 
appropriate  form  and submit  it to GSK  within  24 hours  of learning  of the pregnancy. The  
site must  obtain  the necessary  signed  informed  consent  from  the female  partner. While 
pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or 
SAE.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, e ctopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be reported as 
such.  
The pregnant participant or pregnant partner will be followed to determine the outcome 
of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to 
GSK.  
Any post -study pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the study drug 
by the investigator will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 8.3.4 . While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants 
pregnant female partner, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
 
8.3.6.  Adverse  Events  of Special  Interest  
 
Adverse  events  of special  interest  are not evaluated  in this study.  
 
8.4. Pharmacokinetics  
Blood Sample Collection  
 
Whole blood PK and metabolite samples will be collected for measurement of plasma 
concentrations of VH4011499 (1 mL) and to assess for VH4011499 -related material (2 
mL for most  timepoints,  5 mL for 12 h and 24 h post-dose)  at the timepoints  specified  in 
the SoA (Section 1.3). 
 
One whole blood sample of sufficient volume (typically 3 mL whole blood but will be

Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  TMF-14909676  CONFIDENTIAL  
 218490  
 Protocol Amendment 01    
  typically  5 mL or 6mL  at 12 and  24 h post-dose timepoints,  where  applicable)  will be 
processed into two aliquots of plasma: one to measure concentrations of VH4011499 and 
the other to characterize related metabolites. These samples may also be used to evaluate 
safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study.  
 
In Part 2, whole blood PK samples will also be collected for the measurement of plasma 
concentrations of mida zolam and 1 -hydroxymidazolam (2mL) at the timepoints specified 
in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
 
Approximately 25 -55 blood samples  are planned to be collected to evaluate PK 
objectives for each part of the study. Additional samples may be collected during the 
study if warranted and agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor. The timing 
of sampling may be altered during the course of the study based on newly availa ble data 
(e.g., to obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma concentrations) to ensure 
appropriate monitoring.  
 
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by the 
sponsor. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded.  
 
Note: PK blood samples drawn after the last dose should be collected on an 
approximately 24 -hour cycle (i.e., 24 hours post last dose, 48 hours post last dose, 72 
hours post last dose, etc).  
 
PK samples will be analy sed using an appropriately validated assay method by or under 
the supervision of the sponsor.  
 
The metabolite analyses will be conducted and reported separately from the main study 
report.  
 
Urine Sample Collection  
Urine metabolite samples will be collected at the time -points listed in the SoA (Section 
1.3) and assayed for VH4011499 -related material. Details of urine sample processing,  
storage  and shipping  procedures  are provided  in the SRM.  The metabolite analyses will 
be conducted and reported separately from the main study report.  
 
Entero -Tracker: Bile Sample Collection  
Duodenal bile metab olite samples will be collected on Day 13 or Day 14 in Part 2 (MAD) 
dosing groups  only.  Collection  of samples  should  be performed  for each ascending  MAD  
dosing group. Only  the samples from the highest dosing group will be assayed for 
VH4011499 - related mat erial.  
Bile fluid is recovered on a highly absorbent nylon line which is contained within a 
weighted gelatine capsule. The line unwinds after capsule swallowing as the capsule 
dissolves in the stomach and the line then passes into the duodenum. During with drawal,  
the weighted  section  of the capsule  separates  from  the line and passes  in the stool.  
Additional details of the bile Entero -Tracker sample collection, processing, storage and

and reported separate from the main study report.  
 
8.5. Genetics  
Genetics  are not evaluated  in this study.  
 
8.6. Biomarkers  
The OATP1B1/1B3 biomarker coproporphyrin I will be investigated in this study. Whole 
blood PK samples will also be collected for the measurement of plasma concentrations of 
coproporphyrin I (2mL) at the timepoints specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). Samples 
will be analyzed using an appropria tely validated method under the supervision of the 
sponsor.  
 
8.7. Immunogenicity Assessments  
Immunogenicity is not evaluated in this study.

  9. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
The SAP will be finalized prior to DBL and it will  include  a more  technical  and detailed  
description  of the statistical  analyses  described in this section. This section is a summary 
of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints including primary and 
safety endpoints.  
 
9.1. Statistical  Hypotheses  
 
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of 
VH4011499 in healthy participants following  single (Parts 1 and 3) and multiple (Part 2) 
doses and describe the plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of VH4011499 following 
single (Part 1) and multiple (Part 2) doses.  
No formal statistical hypotheses are to be tested. Point estimates and correspo nding 
confidence intervals will be constructed for any comparisons of interest (test:reference).  
 
9.2. Analysis  Sets 
For purposes  of analysis the  following  analysis sets  are defined:  
 
Analysis set  Description  
Screened  All participants who were screened for eligibility.  
Enrolled  All participants who signed the ICF, passed screening and were 
randomized in the study.  
 
Safety  All enrolled participants who take at least 1 full or partial dose of 
study treatment. Participants will be analysed according to the 
treatment they actually received.  
 
VH499 PK  All participants in the Safety analysis set who have taken at least 
one full dose with at least one non -missing PK assessment. 
(Nonquantifiable values will be considered as non -missing values).  
Further analysis  sets may be defined in the SAP.   
9.3. Statistical  Analyses

 Protocol Amendment 01    
  For all endpoin ts, except for ECG, the baseline value will be the latest pre -dose 
assessment  with a non-missing  value,  including  those  from  unscheduled  visits.  Day 1 pre- 
dose ECGs for each dosing group will be performed in triplicate. In such case  
of triplicate  measurement  for pre-dose,  the average  will be used as baseline.  
 
Continuous  and categorical  variables  will be summarized  using  the following  descriptive 
statistics, unless otherwise specified:  
• Continuous  data:  n (number  of subjects  used for the summary),  arithmetic  
mean, SD, median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum. For PK 
parameters, geometric mean, SD of log -transformed data and geometric  
%CVb  may also be used.  
• Categorical  data:  number  and percentage  of participants  in each category.  
Confidence  intervals  for PK analyses  will use 90% confidence  levels,  unless  otherwise 
specified.  
 
9.3.2.  Primary  Endpoint (s)/Estimands(s)  Analysis  
 
9.3.2.1.  Safety  Analyses  
 
All primary  safety  analyses will  be performed on  the Safety  analysis set . 
 
Primary Endpoints  Statistical Analysis Methods  
AEs In each part, the number and proportion of participants reporting 
AEs will be tabulated by dosing group for VH4011499 and 
collectively for placebo. AEs will also be tabulated by severity and 
relationship to study drug. AEs will be tab ulated using MedDRA 
preferred terms. For the calculations in these tables, each 
participant’s AEs will be counted once under the maximum severity 
or the strongest relationship to study product.  
 
For part 2, AEs leading to study treatment withdrawal will al so be 
summarized. In Part 1 and Part 3, discontinuation of study 
treatment can’t occur as participants receive only 1 dose of study 
treatment.  
 
AEs will be summarized separately for each part of the study.

  9.3.5.  Other  Analysis  
 
In Part 1 (and in Part 2, if data permits),  dose proportionality  will be assessed  by the 
power model for PK parameters.  
 
In Part 2, accumulation  ratios  will be evaluated  by determining  the ratio of last dose (i.e. 
Day 14 for dosing group 1 and optional dosing group 3 or 4, and Day 15 for dosing group 
2 (and optional dosing group 3, if needed))  to first dose (i.e. Day 1 for dosing group 1 and 
optional dosing group 3 or 4, and Day 2 for dosing group 2 (and optional do sing group 3, 
if needed))  on C max, AUC (0-τ) and C τ PK parameters.  
 
In Part 2, attainment  of steady -state will be assessed  by estimating  the slope  of pre-dose 
trough concentrations using at least the last 3 pre -dose concentrations.  
In Part 3, the log-transformed PK parameters (for VH4011499 tablet and for VH4011499 
PiB from the same dose in Part 1) will be analyzed as data permits using a mixed effect 
model with a fixed effect term for tablet vs. PiB. Participant will be treated as a random 
effect in the model. Point estimates and 90% CIs for the ratios of tablet vs. PiB in PK 
parameters will be provided. Additional details will be provided in the SAP.  
 
Special  statistical  and data analysis  considerations  may be warranted  in the event  that the 
COVID -19 or related epidemics or natural disasters may affect the study and data 
integrity. To the extent possible, these will be described in the SAP.

9.3.6.  Safety  and PK dose escalation analyses  
 
Refer  to Section  10.1.5  for information  on the dose escalation  procedure.  Further  details 
about instream data review and the Safety and Dose Escalation Committee and process 
will be recorded in a Dose Escalation Plan document.  
 
9.3.6.1.  Bayesian  dose  escalation  analyses  
 
In the SAD part of the study, beginning with the second dose and for each subsequent 
dose,  the Bayesian  probability  of any participant to exceed  the  
 at the subsequent  dosing  group  will be calculated using PK data of 
participants who received VH4011499 in the previous dosing groups as appropriate.  
Observations on placebo are excluded. This probability, together with safety and 
tolerability  data of the preceding  dosing  groups,  will be used to help selection  of the next 
dose. The Bayesian probability of exceeding the C max NOAEL threshold can be 
calculated for additional potential doses to aid in dose selection, if necessary.  
 
The Bayesian  probability  will be based  on Whitehead’s  model  shown  below. [Whitehead , 
2001] using non -informative prior for model parameters.  
 
 
Where       is log -PK of the   -th participant,  is the log -dose administered to the   -th 
participant.  and     are population intercept and  slope, respectively, and     is the random 
error of the   -th participant.  
 
For the prediction of the second dose in Part 1 and Part 2,  will be assumed to equal 1 
(representing  a dose proportionality  assumption).  This will allow  for the estimation  of the  
remaining parameters of the model using  data from only  one dose level. After the  second 
dose,  will be estimated by the data.  
 
In the MAD part, the probability for either the maximum of C max or maximum of AUC 0-24 
across all participants in the next dose to exceed the MAD PK stopping criteria (see 
section 7.4.1 ) will be calculated using similar Bayesian methodology.  
 
9.3.6.2.  Bayesian  model  Operating  Characteristics  (OC)  – SAD part 
 
In this part, we explore the operating characteristics of the Bayesian dose escalation 
model  for a , in an optional 
expansion dosing group ( see Table 10  and Table 15 ). We are interested to calculate the 
probability to escalate the dose to a  
given that all previous possible doses (i.e. 25, 125, 600 and 1200 mg) have been 
administ ered successfully (see Table 15 ). This will occur when the posterior predictive 
probability that the C max for any participant to exceed the  
is less than a threshold (i.e. 40%, 50%, 60%), given the data from

all previous doses. Additionally, we are interested in calculating the predicted maximum 
Cmax among the 6 participants who will receive the  
 
 
Assuming θ1 = log(0.03) or log(1.82), θ2 = 1 (dose proportionality) and various between 
participant C max variability values (geoCV = 30%, 40%, 50% and 60%) we simulated 
data for 10,000  virtual  trials  using  Whitehead’s  model  for each combination  of θ1, θ2, and 
geoCV. l og(C max) data were simulated from the distribution  
 
log(C max)ij ~ N(θ1 + θ2dj, σ2), 
where  θ1 = log(0.03)  or log(1.82),  θ2 = 1, dj is the j-th log-dose administered  to the i-th 
participant and σ2 is the between participant variance of log(C max) calculated from the 
assumed geoCV.  
 
The values of θ1 are based on the predicted human C max using preclinical data, based on 
two set of simulations  that used different  assumptions;  one assumed  a low bioavailability 
and the other high bioavailability. For each combination of θ1, θ2, and geoCV, each 
virtual trial contains simulated C max values for 4 dosing groups (i.e. 25, 125, 600 and 
1200 mg) of 6 participants each, for the prediction of the 2000 mg dose.  
 
For each combination  of θ1, θ2, and geoCV,  for each simulated  virtual  trial, we fitted  an 
MCMC procedure for log(C max) response using Whitehead’s model with the following 
non-informative priors on the model parameters  
 
θ1 ~ Ν(0, 1/0.01)  
 
θ2 ~ Ν(1, 1/0.01)  
 
1/σ2 ~ Gamma (0.01,  0.01)  
For each virtual  trial, we calculated  the Bayesian  probability  of an individual exceeding 
the C max threshold in the following way:  
 
We had 20,000 iterations in the MCMC procedure. In each iteration, we obtained the 
estimated parameters , , and  (the estimated variance of     ). Based on the 
estimation, a random sample of 20,000 values for each of the 6 participants was drawn 
from the distribution  . This sample represents the predicted 
log(C max) for each participant  with a possible  highest  dose of 2000  mg. The proportion  of 
iterations with the simulated C max for any participant exceeding the  
 is the Bayesian probability of any participant exceeding the 
. 
For each virtual trial, the Bayesian probability of any participant to exceed the NOAEL 
Cmax with the highest dose is compared against different thresholds (i.e. 40%, 50% or 
60%). Among the 10,000 simulated trials, the percentage of trials with Bayesian 
probability  below  the threshold  (i.e. 40%,  50% or 60%)  stands  for the percentage  of trials 
in which we would escalate  (Table 17 ), given that all previous 
possible doses (e.g., 25, 125, 600 an d 1200 mg; see Table 15 ) have been administered.

Additionally,  we calculated  the predicted  maximum  Cmax among  the 6 participants 
planned to receive the , by averaging the maximum C max of the 6 
participants across  all MCMC iterations and virtual trials ( Table 17 ). 
 
Table  17 shows  the predicted  maximum  Cmax concentration  among  6 participants  planned 
to receive  a  (in an optional  expansion  dosing  group)  for 
various assumptions of θ1 and geoCV, given that all previous possible doses have been 
administered successfully. It also shows the probability to escalate to  
 using  various  thresholds  (for decision  making)  for the probability  of any

etc.) it will be possible to escalate the , if needed, assuming all previous 
possible doses in SAD (e.g. 25, 125, 600 and 1200 mg; see Table 15 ) have been 
administered.  
If θ1 = log(1.82), as expected from simu lations using preclinical data based on an 
assumption of high bioavailability, and all other assumptions hold (e.g. dose 
proportionality, i.e. θ1 = 1 etc.)  the probability  to escalate  , assuming 
all previous possible doses in SAD (e.g. 25, 125, 600 and 1200 mg; see Table 15 ) have 
been  administered  is low (i.e. <20%),  regardless  of the assumed  between  participant  Cmax 
variability (i.e. the assumed geoCV) and probabili ty threshold.  
 
9.3.6.3.  Bayesian model Operating Characteristics  (OC) – MAD part  
In this section, we explore the operating characteristics of escalating to various top doses 
(for example, 500 mg, 500 mg) in the MAD part of the study given a starting dose of 200 
mg. 
Under different assumptions of between participant variability (%CVb = 20%, 40%) for 
Cmax and AUC0 -24, PK data (in the log scale) were simulated for 10,000 virtual trials 
from a normal distribution with  
. The means are based on predictions from a population 
PK model for the last dosing day in the first dosing group (for a dose of 200mg) in MAD, 
based on observed PK data from the first 3 dosing groups in the SAD part.  
Each simulated trial contains Cmax and AUC0 -24 values (in the log scale) for 6 subjects 
on treatment for a starting dose of 100 mg. Dose proportional jumps from 200 mg to 
either 500 mg or 700 mg were assumed. The same priors as in S ection 9.3.6.2 were used  
in the Bayesian analysis for each PK parameter. No correlation between PK parameters 
was assumed. We assumed 8 participants in the top dose. We estimated (i) the proportion 
of virtual trials in which the Bayesian predictive probability (using simulated da ta from 
the starting dose of 200 mg) for at least one participant to have a Cmax or AUC0 -24 
above their r espective NOAEL threshold (see S ection 7.4.1 ) in the top dose is <50%, (ii) 
the predicted mean Cmax and AUC0 -24 exposures across all participants in the top dose, 
and (iii) the predicted maximum Cmax and AUC0 -24 across all participants in the top 
dose (see Table 18).

9.4. Interim  Analysis  
There  will be no formal  interim  analysis.  
 
Preliminary  safety, tolerability, and available PK data will be reviewed internally  prior  to 
each dose escalation  and prior to initiation of Parts 2 and 3 . Dose  escalation  can only 
occur  after the SDEC  has found  that the safety  and PK profiles  are supportive  to proceed 
with the evaluation of the next higher dose level ( see Section 6.5). 
 
Additional data cuts  and analyses may be conducted to support regulatory needs, 
publications  or for other  purposes,  if needed.  Criteria  for data quality  for data released  for 
these purposes will be described in the study data management plan.  
 
9.5. Final  Analyses  
Final  analyses  will be performed  after the completion  of the study  and final datasets 
authorization.  
 
Data will be listed and summarized according to GSK reporting standards, where 
applicable.  Listings  will be sorted  by participant,  treatment  and day; summaries  will be 
presented by treatment, day, and time.  
 
More  details  will be included  in the SAP.  
 
9.6. Sample  Size Determination  
 
Sample  size for all parts of the study is based  on feasibility  and no formal  calculation  of 
power  or sample  size has been performed.  
 
Parts 1 and  2 
A sample size of approximately 6 -8 active and 2 placebo participants per dosing group 
should be sufficient to provide useful estimates of both inter - and intra - participant 
variability for VH4011499 PK parameters and initial safety assessment.  
 
Although  the sample size is not based on statistical criteria, general probabilities can be 
determined for the likelihood of observing AEs. With 6 or 8 active participants per 
dosing group, if the true rate of an adverse event is 5%, the chance of seeing at least 1 
participant with the adverse event for a given dosing group is 26% or 34%, respectively. 
Similarly, if the true adverse event rate is 20%, the chance of seeing at least 1 participant 
with the adverse event for a given dosing group is 74% or 83%, respecti vely.  
 
For Part 2, for dosing groups in which midazolam is administered, with a sample size of 8 
active participants, assuming a geometric CV w for midazolam of 15% (estimated from

  study 213052; GSK Document Number 2019N422949_01 ) for AUC(0 -∞), the expected 
precision of the estimated ratio of midazolam AUC(0 -∞) for midazolam + VH4011499 
vs. midazolam will be as follows:  
 
 
Drug  CV w Half-width  
(log-scale)  Ratio 90% CI  
Midazolam  15% 0.141  0.9 (0.781, 1.037)  
1.0 (0.868, 1.152)  
1.1 (0.955, 1.267)  
 
Part 3  
To investigate the tablet PK a sample size of 6 active participants will be used in the 
dosing group using tablet formulation in Part 3.  
 
The median of between -subject variability (geometric CVb) in VH4011499 PK 
parameters from the PiB administration across the first 3 dosing groups in SAD in this 
study were 26% and 30% for C max and AUC (0-∞), respectively.  
Assuming a between -subject geometric coefficient of variation (CV b) of 30% and a 
sample size of 6 active participants per group (i.e. PiB, tablet), it is estimated that the half 
width of the 90% CI for the formulation difference on the log -scale will be within 0.31 of 
the PK parameter (e.g. Cmax, AUC (0-Inf)) point estimate. If the point estimate of the ratio 
of geometric means of PK parameters is assumed to be 1, then the 90% CI of the ratio 
will be approximately (0.74, 1.36).  
 
9.6.1.  Sample Size Sensitivity  
 
Part 2 (dosing groups with midazolam administration)  
A sensitivity analysis assuming a higher within -subject variability, CVw of 25% for 
midazolam AUC (0-∞) and a sample size of 10 active participants was conducted. Table 19 
below shows the expected precision of the estimated ratio of AUC (0-∞) of midazolam for 
midazolam +VH4011499 vs. midazolam.

The precision of the estimated ratio (i.e. 90% CI width) of midazolam AUC (0-∞) 
midazolam +VH4011499 vs. midazolam increases only by ~14% when increasing the 
sample size from 8 to 10 participants in the VH4011499 arm.  
Part 3  
A sensitivity analysis assuming a higher between -subject variability, CV b of 40% for PK 
parameters (e.g. Cmax,  AUC (0-∞)) and a sample size of 10 active participants for the 
tablet formulation was conducted. Table 20 below shows the expected 90% CI of the 
ratio of geometric mea ns for various assumed estimated ratios, as an example.

considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected 
and a study -site closure  visit has been  performed. The  investigator  may initiate  study -site 
closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in 
advance of the intended termination.  
 
Reasons  for the early  closure  of a study  site by the sponsor  or investigator  may include 
but are not limited to:  
 
For study  termination:  
 
• Discontinuation  of further  study  intervention  development For site termination:Failure 
of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC  or 
local  health  authorities,  the sponsor's  procedures,  or GCP  guidelines  
• Inadequate  or no recruitment  of participants  (evaluated  after a reasonable  amount of 
time) by the investigator  
• If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly 
inform the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authoriti es, and any contract  
research  organization(s)  used in the study  of the reason  for termination  or suspension, 
as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall 
promptly inform the subject and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or 
follow -up

Section  7.1 and Section 10.5.  All events of ALT  3 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) and total bilirubin 2 × ULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3 × ULN 
and international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5, if INR measured, which may 
indicate severe liver injury (possible Hy’s law),  must be reported to  
V H / GSK in an expedited manner (excluding studies of hepatic 
impairment or cirrhosis). Laboratory analytes to be tested will include the 
routine liver panel and additional analytes [such as lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH),  gamma -glutamyl tr ansferase (GGT), glutamate dehydrogenase 
(GLDH) and serum albumin].  
2. Recommend repeat testing if creatine phosphokinase is elevated to 
ensure the result is transient or due to exercise. A history regarding use of 
drugs known to cause increase of CPK (such a s statins), physical activity 
or exercise preceding the CPK evaluation should be obtained.  
3. Estimated serum creatinine clearance (using Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration equation) at screening for eligibility 
determination.  
4. If alkaline phosp hatase is elevated, consider fractionating.

  10.3.  Appendix 3: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
10.3.1.  Definition of  AE 
 
AE Definition   
• An AE is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a clinical  study  participant, 
temporally  associated with the use of a study  intervention, whether or not 
considered related to the study intervention.  
NOTE:  An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.  
 
Definition of Unsolicited and Solicited AE 
• Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e., symptoms or illnesses 
requiring a hospitalization, emergency room visit, or visit to/by a healthcare 
provider). The participant will be instructed to contact the site as soon as possible to 
report medically attended event(s), as well as any events that, though not medically 
attended, are of participant concern. Detailed information about reported unsolicited 
AEs will be collected by qualified site personnel and documented in the 
participant’s re cords.  
• Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by the 
participant will be collected during an interview with the participants and by review 
of available medical records at the next visit.  
•Any abnormal  laboratory  test results  (hematology,  clinical  chemistry,  or urinalysis)  
or other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not 
related to progression of underlying disease).  
•Exacerbation  of a chronic  or intermittent  pre-existing  condition  including  either  
an increase in frequenc y and/or intensity of the condition.  
•New  condition  detected  or diagnosed  after study  intervention  administration  
even though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either  study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE  unless  it is an intentional  overdose  taken  with possible  suicidal/self -
harming

 218490  
 Protocol Amendment 01    
  • Solicited AEs are predefined loca l and systemic events for which the participant is 
specifically questioned, and which are noted by the participant.  
   
 
10.3.2.  Definition of SAE 
 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or more  of the 
criteria  listed:  
a. Results  in death  
b. Is life threatening  
The term 'life-threatening'  in the definition  of 'serious'  refers  to an event  in which  the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
•Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal 
safety assessments  that are associated  with the underlying  disease,  unless  
judged  by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
•The disease/disorder  being  studied  or expected  progression,  signs,  or symptoms  of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.  
•Medical  or surgical  procedure  (e.g.,  endoscopy,  appendectomy):  the condition  
that leads to the procedure is the AE.  
•Situations  in which  an untoward  medica l occurrence  did not occur  (social  
and/or convenience admission to a hospital).  
•Anticipated  day-to-day fluctuations  of pre-existing  disease(s)  or condition(s)  
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

 218490  
 Protocol Amendment 01    
  c. Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted 
(usually  involving  at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency  ward 
for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization  are AE. If a complication  prolongs  hospitalization  or fulfills  any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious.  
 
• Hospitalization  for elective  treatment  of a pre-existing  condition  that did not 
worsen from bas eline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• The term disability  means  a substantial disruption of  a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disru ption.  
e. Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
f. Is a suspected  transmission  of any infectious  agent  via an authorized  
medicinal product  
g. Other  situations:  
• Possible Hy’s Law case: ALT≥3xULN AND total bilirubin ≥2xULN (>35% 
direct  bilirubin)  or international  normalized  ratio (INR)  >1.5 must  be reported 
as SAE  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the investigator in 
deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as 
significant medical events that may jeopar dize the participant or may require 
medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the other  outcomes  listed  in 
the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, inte nsive treatment for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions,  or development  of intervention  
dependency  or intervention abuse.

10.3.3.  Recording  and Follow -Up of AE  and SAE 
 
 
 
 
•When  an AE/SAE  occurs,  it is the responsibility  of the investigator  to review  
all documentation  (e.g. hospital  progress  notes,  laboratory,  and diagnostics  
reports) related to  the event.  
•The investigator  will then record  all relevant  AE/SAE  information.  
•It is not acceptable  for the investigator  to send photocopies  of the 
participant’s medical records to VH/GSK in lieu of completion of the 
VH/GSK required form.  
•There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested  by VH/GSK. In  this case,  all participant identifiers,  with the exception  
of the  participant  number,  will be redacted  on the copies  of the medical  records  
before submission to VH/GSK.  
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms,  and/or  other  clinical  information.  Whenever  possible,  the diagnosis  
(not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
    
•Every  AE and SAE  reported  during  the trial should  be evaluated  by the 
investigator  and graded in the eCRF according to the DAIDS toxicity scales.  
 
•Note:  Grade  4 DAIDS  toxicity  grades  for laboratory  parameters  that are 
asymptomatic would not necessarily  be considered SAEs, a clinical correlation 
would be necessary.  
 
•Where a DAIDS toxicity  scale is not available for a particular event or 
parameter, then the  investigator  will instead  make  an assessment  of intensity  
using  one of the following categories:  
 
•Mild:  An event  that is easily  tolerated  by the participant, causing  minimal  
discomfort  and not interfering with everyday activities.  
 
•Moderate:  An event  that is sufficiently  discomforting  to interfere  with normal  
everyday activities.  
 
•Severe:  An event  that prevents  normal  everyday  activities. - an AE that is assessed  
as severe  will not be confused  with an SAE.  Severity  is a category  utilized  for 
rating  the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.

 Protocol Amendment 01    
   
 
•The investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  study  intervention  
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment 
to determine the relationship.  
•A reasonable possibility of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or  arguments  to suggest  a causal  relationship,  rather  than a relationship  cannot  
be ruled out.  
•Alternative  causes,  such as underlying  disease(s),  concomitant  therapy,  and other  
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationsh ip of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated . 
 
•The investigator  will also consult  the Investigator’s  Brochure  (IB) and/or  Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
 
•For each AE/SAE,  the investigator  must  document  in the medical  notes  that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
 
•The investigator  will also consult  the Investigator’s  Brochure  (IB) and/or  Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
•For each AE/SAE,  the investigator  must  document  in the medical  notes  that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality  
 
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to VH/GSK. However, it is very 
important  that the investigator  always  make  an assessment  of causality  for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to VH/GSK.  
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information  and send an SAE  follow -up report  with the updated  causality  
assessment

10.3.4.  Reporting  of SAE to VH/GSK  
 
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental measurements  and/or  evaluations  as medically  indicated  or as 
requested  by VH/GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE 
as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation wit h other health care 
professionals.  
•If a participant  dies during  participation  in the study  or during  a recognized  follow -
up period, the investigator will provide VH/GSK with a copy of any postmortem 
findings including histopathology.  
•New  or updated  information  will be recorded  in the originally  submitted  documents.  
•The investigator  will submit  any updated  SAE  data to VH/GSK  within  24 hours  of 
receipt of the information.  
     
•The primary  mechanism for  reporting  SAE  to VH/GSK  will be the electronic  
data collection tool.  
•If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection  tool (see next SAE  Reporting  to VH/GSK  via Paper  Data  Collection  
Tool) to report the event within 24 hours.  
•The site will enter  the SAE  data into the electronic  system  as soon  as it 
becomes available.  
•After  the study  is completed  at a given  site, the electronic  data collection  tool will 
be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives 
updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool 
has been taken  off-line, then the site can report  this information  on a paper  SAE  
form  (see next table on SAE Reporting to VH/GSK via Paper Data Collection 
Tool) or to the Sponsor medical monitor/SAE c oordinator by telephone.  
•Contacts  for SAE  reporting  can be found  in the SRM.  
         
•Facsimile  transmission  of the SAE  paper  data collection  tool is the preferred  
method to transmit this information to the Sponsor medical monitor or the SAE 
coordinator .

  10.4.  Appendix  4: Contraceptive  and Barrier  Guidance  
As per Section 5.1 (Inclusion Criteria) of  the protocol a female participant (female sex 
assigned at birth) is eligible to participate in this study if she is a woman of 
nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP)  or a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) 
and is using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per 
year), with low user dependency, during the study intervention period and for at least 58 
days after the last dose of  study intervention.  
 
 
10.4.1.  Woman  of Nonchildbearing  Potential  (WONCBP)  
 
Women  in the following  categories are  considered WONCBP:  
 
1. Premenopausal  female  with permanent  infertility  due to one of the 
following  (for the purpose of this study):  
• Documented  hysterectomy  
• Documented  bilateral  salpingectomy  
• Documented  bilateral  oophorectomy  
For individuals  with permanent  infertility  due to an alternate  medical  cause  other  than the 
above,  (e.g.,  Mullerian  agenesis,  androgen  insensitivity,  gonadal  dysgenesis),  investigator 
discretion should be applied to determining study entry.  
 
Note : Documentation  can come  from  the site personnel’s  review  of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
 
2. Postmenopausal  female  
A postmenop ausal  state is defined  as no menses  for 12 months  without  an alternative 
medical cause.  
 
• A high follicle  stimulating  hormone  (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may  
be used to confirm  a postmenopausal  state in women  not using  hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence 
of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement 
>40 IU/L or mIU/mLis required.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt must discontinue HRT  
to allow  confirmation  of postmenopausal  status  before  study  enrollment.

10.4.2.  Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
 
Women in the following categories are considered WOCBP (fertile):  
 
• Adolescents of childbearing potential: Tanner stage ≥2 (post -thelarche) 
irrespective of the occurrence of menarche or following menarche.  
• From the time of menarche until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently 
sterile (see below)  
 
Note:  Menarche is the first onset of menses in a young female. Menarche is normally 
preceded by several cha nges associated with puberty including breast development and 
pubic hair growth.  
 
10.4.3.  Contraception  Guidance  
 
Male  participants  must  agree  to use contraception/barrier  as detailed  below:  
 
• Agree to use a male condom and should also be advised of the 
benefit for  a female  partner  (if of child -bearing  potential)  to use a 
highly  effective  method  of contraception as a condom may break or 
leak when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing 
potential who is not currently pregnant.  
AND  
• Female partner of chi ld-bearing potential to use an additional 
highly effective  contraceptive  method (with  a failure  rate of <1%)  
that has a low user dependency or that is user dependent.  
 
FOR FEMALE PARTNERS OF MALE PARTICPANTS CONSIDERED 
WOCBP, CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED  DURING  THE  STUDY  INCLUDE:

Sexual  abstinence  
Sexual  abstinence  is considered  a highly  effective  method  only if defined  as refraining  from  heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the  preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.  
a. Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of 
contraceptive  methods  for those  participating  in clinical  studies.  
b. Failure rate of <1% per year when used  consistently and  correctly. Typical use failure rates differ from those when 
used consistently and correctly  
c. If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable 
contraceptive methods are limited to those  which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of action.  
Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, 
and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male  
condom  and female  condom  should  not be used together  (due to risk of failure  from friction)  
 
 
Female participants considered WOCBP must  agree  to use contraception  as detailed  below:  
 
• Agree to use an additional highly effective  contraceptive  method (with a failure 
rate of <1% per year), with low user dependency, during the study intervention period 
and for at least 58 days (e.g., 28 - day post dose follow -up period plus 30 days (a 
menstrual cycle) after the last dose of study inte rvention. Highly effective, low user -
dependency (with a failure rate of <1% per year) are limited to intrauterine 
devices/systems or bilateral tubal occlusion ≥3 months prior to screening.  
 
Note:  Documented evidence of contraception procedures (IUD/IUS/occlusion) below are 
required. Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records.

and to evaluate liver event etiology  
 
Phase 1 Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria and Required Follow Up Assessments  
 
Liver Chemistry  Stopping  Criteria  
 
ALT-absolute  ALT≥3xULN  
If ALT≥3xULN AND total bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or 
international  normalized  ratio (INR)  >1.5,  report  as an SAE1,2. 
Required  Actions,  Monitoring  and Follow  up Assessments  
Actions  Follow  Up Assessments  
• Immediately  discontinue  study drug 
• Report  the event to GSK within  24 hours  
• Complete the liver event form and complete an 
SAE data collection tool if the event also meets 
the criteria for an SAE2 
• Perform liver event follow up assessments as 
described in the Follow Up Assessment column.  
• Do not restart or rechallenge participant with 
study drug  
• Monitor the participant until liver chemistries 
resolve, stabilise, or return to within baseline (see 
MONITORING ) 
MONITORING:  
If ALT≥3xULN AND total bilirubin  2xULN or 
INR >1.5  
• Repeat liver chemistries (include ALT, 
aspartate transaminase [AST], alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin and INR)  and 
perform liver event follow up assessments 
within 24 hours  
• Monitor participant twice weekly until liver 
chemistries resolve, stabilise or  return to 
within baseline  • Viral hepatitis  serology3 
• Obtain INR and recheck with each liver

Liver Chemistry  Stopping  Criteria  
• A specialist or hepatology consultation is 
recommended  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If ALT≥3xULN AND total bilirubin < 2xULN and 
INR ≤1.5:  
• Perform liver chemistries (include ALT, AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and INR) and 
perform liver event follow up assessments 
within 24-72 hours  
• Monitor participant weekly until liver 
chemistries resolve, stabilize or return to 
within baseline  medications on the concomitant 
medications report form including 
acetaminophen, herbal remed ies, 
recreational drugs, and other over the 
counter  medications.  
• Record alcohol use on the liver event 
alcohol  intake  form 
 
If ALT≥3xULN AND total bilirubin  2xULN 
or INR >1.5 obtain the following in addition to 
the assessments listed above : 
• Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth 
muscle  antibody,  Type  1 anti-liver 
kidney microsomal antibodies, and 
quantitative total immunoglobulin G 
(IgG)  or gamma  globulins.  
• Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic 
resonance, or computed tomography) 
and /or liver biopsy to evaluate liver 
disease; complete Liver Imaging form.  
• Liver biopsy may be considered and 
discussed with local specialists if 
available,  for instance:  
o In participants when serology 
raises  the possibility  of 
autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)  
o In participants  when 
suspected DILI progresses or 
fails to resolve on withdrawal 
of study drug  
o In participants with acute or 
chronic atypical presentation.  
• If liver biopsy is conducted, then complete 
liver biopsy form  
1. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin 
fractionation  testing  is unavailable , record the absence/presence of detectable urinary 
bilirubin on dipstick , which is  indicative  of direct  bilirubin  elevations  suggesting  liver 
injury.  
2. All events of ALT  3xULN and total bilirubin  2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT  
3xULN and INR>1.5, which  may indicate  severe  liver injury (possible  ‘Hy’s Law’),  must be 
reported  as an SAE (excluding  studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis); the I NR 
threshold value stated  will not apply to participants receiving anticoagulants

  3. Includes: hepatitis A immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody; HBsAg and HBcAb; hepatitis C RNA; 
cytomegalovirus IgM antibody; Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if 
unavailable, heterophile antibody or monospot testing) and  hepatitis  E IgM antibody  
4. Record the date/time  of the PK blood sample  draw and the date/time  of the last dose of 
study drug prior to PK blood sample draw. If the date or time of the last dose is unclear, 
provide the participant’s best approximation. If the date/time of the last dose  cannot be 
approximated OR a PK sample cannot be  collected  in the time period indicated above, do 
not obtain a PK sample. Instructions for sample handling and shipping are in the SRM.

of Adult  and Pediatric  Adverse  Events  Version  2.1, July 2017  
VERSION 2.1, July 2017  
 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events  (“DAIDS  AE Grading  Table”)  is a descriptive  terminology  which  can be utilised 
for Adverse Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE 
term.  
 
Estimating Severity Grade for Parameters Not Identified in the Grading Table The 
functional table below should be used  to grade the severity  of an AE that is not 
specifically  identified  in the grading  table.  In addition,  all deaths  related  to an AE are to 
be classified as grade 5  
 
For more  information,  please  refer  to the DAIDS  grading  table  Version  2.1, July 2017  at

 Protocol Amendment 01    
  10.8.  Appendix  8: Permissible  Procedures  During  COVID -19 
Pandemic  
Overall Rationale for this Appendix  
 
COVID -19 pandemic may impact the conduct of clinical studies. Challenges may arise 
from  quarantines,  site closures,  travel  limitations,  interruptions  to the supply  chain  for the 
study  drug or other considerations if site personnel or study  participants become infected 
with COVID -19. These challenges may lead to difficulties in meeting protocol -specified 
procedures, including administering or using the study drug or adhering to protocol - 
mandated visits and laboratory/diagnostic testing.  
 
This protocol  appendix  outlines  measures  that may be applicable  for any site impacted  by 
the COVID -19 pandemic. The purpose of the appendix is to provide information on the 
measures to be taken to protect participants’ safety, welfare and rights, and promote data 
integrity.  
 
These  measures  will remain  in place  until the site is able to resume normal  working 
activities.  
 
Study Procedures During COVID -19 Pandemic  
 
During  the special  circumstances  caused  by the current  COVID -19 pandemic,  clinical  
investigators  should consider specific public health guidance, the impact of any travel 
restrictions implemented by local/regional health authorities and local institutions, and 
individual benefit /risk when making enrollment and treatment decisions for trial 
participants.  
 
Every  effort  should  be made  to adhere  to protocol -specified  assessmen ts for participants 
on study  drug,  including  follow  up however when not  possible,  for the duration  of these 
special circumstances, the following measures may be implemented for enrolled 
participants.  
 
Clinical  investigators  should  document  in site files and the eCRF  how restrictions related 
to COVID -19 led to the changes in study conduct and duration of those changes and 
indicate which trial participants were impacted and how those trial participants were  
impacted  (as per the  current local COVID -19 related regulatory guidance).  
 
Missing  protocol  required  data/visits  due to COVID -19 should  be noted  in participant 
notes and recorded as a COVID -19 protocol deviation.  
 
Participants  previously  deemed  eligible  during  the screening  period  unable  to attend 
within the allowable screening window due to COVID -19 may be rescreened.  
 
A participant must be withdrawn from study drug and discontinued from the study if 
he/she is found to have SARS -CoV -2 infection during an inpatient stay. The management 
of all other i npatient participants within the same dosing group should be discussed by 
the investigator and the medical monitor. Individuals who have not been exposed to the 
118 
Clinical  Study  Protocol  template  V17 dated  24-Jan-2022  TMF-14909676  CONFIDENTIAL  
 218490  
 Protocol Amendment 01    
  virus will be permitted to remain in the clinic and fulfil their inpatient stay. Individuals 
who have been exposed will be discharged home regardless of  whether  they are 
symptomatic. Individuals  who are  discharged  home  may still be able to continue in the 
study at the discretion of the investigator and the medical monitor  assuming  the 
participant  adheres  to current  Centers  for Disease  Control  and Prevention guidance for 
exposure and assuming the participant continues to have a negative SARS -CoV -2 test 
status.  
 
Participants  who test positive  during  the outpatient  phase  of the trial may proceed  in 
the study at the discretion of the investigator and sponsor assuming the participant 
isolates according to current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and 
then has a repeat SARS -CoV -2 test that is negative.  
 
Participants  who are withdrawn  from the study  due to COVID -19 infection  (including  
exposure to COVID -19) may be replaced based upon the discretion of the sponsor and 
investigator.  
Data Management/Monitoring:  
If on -site monitoring is no longer permitted, VH/GSK will consider remote Source Data 
Verification/Source Document Review (SDV/SDR) where permitted by the clinical 
site/institution. Remote SDV/SDR will be proposed to study  sites to meet a patient  and/or  
critical  quality  need,  e.g., to assess  participant  safety  or to ensure  data integri ty. In case of 
remote SDV/SDR, VH/GSK will work with the site to ensure participant privacy.  
 
eCRF/CRF Final or Interim Sign off Process: The Principal Investigator (PI) is 
responsible for ensuring that the data within the eCRF casebook and any other data 
sources utilized during the study  for each study  participant is complete and consistent 
with source documents throughout the study (ICH GCP 4.9.1 4.9.2). The PI may sign/re -
sign the eCRF from any computer/location by accessing InForm (or other  eDC platform ) 
using  his/her  unique  eCRF  log-in credentials.  The PI may delegate  this activity to another 
medically qualified and trained sub -investigator and this must be documented  on the 
Delegation  of Responsibilities  (DoR) Log. It  is recommended  that the PI identifies a sub -
investigator as a back -up for eCRF signatures. The sub - investigator must be 
appropriately trained on the protocol and eCRF requirements (with training documented), 
and the DoR log updated accordingly.  
 
Essential  Document  Sign Off  Process:  If an investigator  is unable  to print  and sign 
essential documents such as Protocol /Amendment signature page then Email approval  
can be accepted  by replying  to the relevant  email  that is sent by VH/GSK

CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALSTUDY SYNOPSIS
Study Title: A Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinic al 
Trial of BBI608 plus Weekly Paclitaxel vs. Placebo plus Weekly 
Paclitaxel in Adult Patients with Advanced, Previously Treated 
Gastric and Gastro-Esophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
Study Number: BBI608-336 
Study Phase: III
Study Drug: BBI608 is a novel investigational orally administered small mol ecule 
anticancer drug that targets cancer stem cells (CSC). CSC are co nsidered 
to be fundamentally responsible for malignant growth, relapse, 
metastasis, and resistance to conventional therapies. BBI608 bl ocks 
CSC self-renewal and induces cell death in CSC as well as non-s tem 
cancer cells by inhibition of the STAT3, ȕ-catenin and Nanog pathways. 
BBI608 has shown potent anti-tumor and anti- metastatic activities in 
pre-clinical gastric cancer models, and has shown highly synerg istic 
effect in combination with paclitaxel.
In a Phase Ib/II clinical trial, BBI608 in combination with week ly 
paclitaxel has been safely administered to more than 80 patients , with 
the Recommended Phase 2 Dose of BBI608 determined to be the ful l 
monotherapy dose. Adverse event (AE) profiles were similar to t hat of 
both agents in monotherapy, with no new or additive effects see n. 
BBI608 related AEs were generally gastrointestinal in nature, a nd most 
frequently CTCAE Grade 1 or Grade 2. Encouraging signs of activ ity 
were observed in patients with gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma, with  
disease control in 6 of 7 patients, objective response in 3 of 7  patients 
(partial responses of 44%, 48%, and 100% respectively), and a m edian 
progression free survival of 23 weeks. Survival data is maturing .
Primary 
Objective:To compare overall survival (OS) of patients with pre-treated, advanced 
gastric and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma treated 
with BBI608 plus weekly paclitaxel versus placebo plus weekly 
paclitaxel.  OS is defined as the time from randomization until  d e a t h  
from any cause.  
Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety profile of BBI608 administered daily plu s weekly 
p a c l i t a x e l  i n  p a t i e n t s  w i t h  p r e - t r e a t e d  a d v a n c e d  g a s t r i c / G E J  
adenocarcinoma, with safety assessed according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCA E)
version 4.0. 
Study Design: This is a study which began as a randomized, double-blind, mult i-center, 
phase III study of BBI608 plus weekly paclitaxel vs. placebo pl us 
weekly paclitaxel for adult patients with advanced, pre-treated  gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma who have failed first line therapy containing a 
fluoropyrimidine and a platinum-based agent. At the time of this 
amendment, patients remaining on study treatment will be unblin ded 
and the study will continue as a randomized, open-label, multi- center, 
phase III study of BBI608 plus weekly paclitaxel vs. weekly pac litaxel

South America); time to progression on first line therapy (<6 m onths vs.

present); and prior taxane therapy (yes vs. no). 
Until the time of this amendment, the study proceeded in 28-day (4-
week) cycles.  BBI608 or placebo was administered orally, twice  daily, 
with doses separated by 12 hours.  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2IV was
administered weekly, on day 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 day study cy cle. 
BBI608 or placebo administration bega n 2 days prior to the first 
paclitaxel infusion. From the time of this amendment, and since 
unblinding of patients remaining on study treatment, patients w ill 
continue study treatment as prior to unblinding as long as it i s felt to be 
in their best interest by the Investigator and with patient’s i nformed 
consent. Placebo will no longer be administered. 
Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks after 
randomization until objective disease progression.   
Study Population: This study will enroll patients with a cytological or histologi cally 
confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-esophageal ju nction 
(GEJ) that is metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable. Pa tients 
will have failed treatment with one regimen containing a t least a 
platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet  for unresectable or metastati c 
disease.  
Patients who have received prior taxane therapy may be enrolled , so
long as the taxane was administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
setting and progression occurred more than 6 months following 
completion of therapy.

Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Until the time of this amendment, patients in this study receiv ed BBI608 
or matched placebo orally, daily, at 480 mg bid ( 960 mg total daily 
dose). In each cycle BBI608 was taken daily for 4 weeks (28 day s). 
BBI608 or placebo was administer ed twice daily, one hour prior or two

remaining on study treatment, patients will continue study trea tment as 
prior to unblinding as long as it is felt to be in their best i nterest by the 
Investigator and with patient’s informed consent. Placebo will no longer

CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALDuration of 
Treatment: Patients may continue to receive protocol therapy until Septemb er 15th
2017 and as long as they have not experienced any adverse events 
requiring permanent discontinuation of study medication and have  not 
demonstrated disease progression based on RECIST criteria. If 
paclitaxel is discontinued due to toxicity, BBI608 may be conti nued as 
monotherapy until another discontinuation criterion is met. If B BI608 is 
discontinued due to toxicity, paclitaxel should be continued as  
monotherapy until another discontinuation criterion is met. The study is 
planned to close on September 15, 2017, at which time study med ication 
will no longer be provided. 
Statistical Methods: The primary study endpoint is Overall Survival (OS).  The study  i s  
designed to have a power of 90% and a two-sided alpha of 5% to detect 
a 24% reduction in the continuous risk of death (HR 0.76, which 
corresponds to an increase of median survival from 7.36 to 9.67  months) 
in the Intention to Treat (ITT) general study population. It is estimated 
that 566 events will be required to detect this reduction which would be 
observed by randomizing 700 patients over 24 months and following 
them for an additional 12 months (including up to 5% of yearly 
dropouts).  
There was one interim analysis in this study presented to the 
independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). Additional ly, 
DSMB reviewed safety during conduct of the study. The role and 
responsibility of the DSMB was defined in a separate Charter.
The interim analysis was performed on OS, the primary endpoint of this 
study, when at least 2/3
rdsof the required number of events (380) have 
been observed. This analysis, based on the stratified log- rank test 
adjusting for the stratification variables at randomization, te sted the 
following: 
H0VXUYLYDORQ%%,SDFOLWD[HOVXUYLYDORQSDFOLWD[HO
versus
H1: survival on BBI608+paclitaxel > survival on paclitaxel 
The comparison of the overall population was tested based on a 
generalization of the Lan-DeMets error spending function approac h 
using an O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary to reject H 0, controlling 
for a two-sided alpha of 5 % at the end of the study. For example, if 
exactly 380 deaths (67% of the required events) were in the lock ed 
database for the interim analysis, the nominal critical point f or rejecting 
H0would be 2.502, corresponding to a p-value of 0.012.  Thus H 0 would 
be rejected, and superiority of BBI608 declared, early if the p -value 
from stratified log-rank test is < 0.012.

Planned sample size is 700 patients (350 on Arm 1 and 350 on Arm  2). 
Study Conduct Post-Unblinding:  
Following the review of the interim analysis, per DSMB recommend ations, patients remaining on study 
treatment were unblinded. 
However, post-unblinding, the trial will continue with patients who have not yet met the primary study 
endpoint (death), and with patie nts currently on protocol thera py and who may receive BBI608 and 
paclitaxel on study based on the clinical judgement of the inves tigator that this is in the patient’s best
interest, providing the patient is fully informed and provides consent (see also Sections 9.1.1 and 9.2.1). 
Patients will receive study treatment supply until any of the d iscontinuation criteria are met (see Section 
11.1) or until September 15 2017, whichever occurs first. The p rotocol will continue to be followed for all 
endpoints.

CONFIDENTIAL 9 CONFIDENTIAL2BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE
2.1 GASTRIC AND GASTROESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION (GEJ) CANCER
Gastric cancer and cancer of the gastro-esophageal junction (GE J )  a r e  a  s i g n i f i c a n t  c a u s e  o f  
morbidity and mortality worldwide and have the second highest de ath rate of all cancers with 
736,000 deaths recorded in 2008 [WHO, 2013] . Combined, they are the fourth most prevalent 
malignancy with nearly 1,000,000 new cases of gastric and GEJ c ancer diagnosed annually 
worldwide [Ferlay 2008] . In the United States, 21,600 new cases of gastric and GEJ canc er are 
estimated for 2013 with 10,990 dying from the disease [NCI 2013] . Surgery is considered the 
only potentially curative treatment, however, more than 70% of patients present with locally 
advanced or metastatic disease [Sugano 2008] . Out of the minority of presenting patients who 
qualify for curative surgery, most will develop disseminated ad vanced disease with a 5-year 
survival rate of only 20-25% [Arak  1994; Cunningham 2006] .
Standard treatment for unresectable and metastatic disease curren tly includes first-line 5-
fluorouracil (5-FU) and platinum chemotherapy based regimen (+/-  human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER-2) antibody) with patients ultimately pr ogressing on first-line therapy or 
exhibiting primary refractory disease leading to a median survi val between 9 and 14 months 
[Cunningham 2008; Wagner 2006; Wagner 2010] . A meta-analysis of 35 trials and 5726 patients 
suggested that the anthracycline compound, epirubicin, improves  survival in combination with 
first-line 5-FU and platinum-based chemotherapy making the trip le regimen of 5-FU, platinum 
and epirubicin a first-line treatment option for advanced gastri c and GEJ cancer in the US and 
Europe [Wagner 2010] . A subsequent randomized phase 2 study, however, showed no ben efit 
with the addition of an anthracycline to a 5-FU and platinum reg imen [Enzinger 2010] .  
Despite poor survival rates in gastric and GEJ cancer, the past  decade has seen some progress in 
second-line therapy for this disease with approximately 20-50% of patients receiving second-line 
therapy world-wide [Pozzo 2004; Bouche 2004; Chau 2004a; Lee 2007] . Second-line therapy has 
shown a median survival of 5.6 months as compared to survival o f approximately 2.5 months in 
patients not receiving treatment following progression on first -line therapy [Chau 2004a] . Three 
recent randomized phase III studies provide evidence to support  the use of second-line therapy in 
advanced gastric and GEJ cancer, showing survival benefit of sin gle agent docetaxel and 
irinotecan [Kang 2012; Thuss-Patience 2011; Cook 2013] . A meta-analysis of these three 
second-line gastric cancer trials (including a total of 410 pat ients) reported a significant reduction 
in the risk of death with a HR of 0.64 (CI 0.52-0.79 and P<0.00 01) with administration of either 
docetaxel or irinotecan chemotherapy [Kim 2013] . A recently published study of paclitaxel 
compared with irinotecan shows that the two treatments have simi lar effects on overall survival, 
progression free survival and response rate. Additionally, pacl itaxel was shown to have a superior 
safety profile to irinotecan with respect to gastrointestinal a dverse events such as anorexia, 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [Hironaka 2013] . In addition to improvements in survival, 
second-line therapy has also led to improvement in patient qual ity of life and significantly 
improved symptom scores for pain [Cook 2013] . 
In 2013, ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-2 antagonist, was reported to improve 
overall survival by 1.4 months as monotherapy in the second-lin e setting [Fuchs 2013], adding 
anti-angiogenic therapy to the gastric and GEJ cancer therapy a rmamentarium. Ramucirumab has 
also been studied in combination with weekly paclitaxel in the s ame patient population in the
randomized phase III RAINBOW study which was recently announced  to have met its primary 
endpoint of overall survival. The addition of ramucirumab to pa clitaxel provided a 2.3 month

CONFIDENTIAL 10 CONFIDENTIALincrease above the 7.36 month median overall survival of paclit axel alone [Wilke 2014] .
Ramucirumab received FDA approval in April 2014 for monotherapy t reatment of gastric and 
GEJ adenocarcinoma following progression on fluoropyrimidine or  platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
Currently, a patient with progressive disease on first-line the rapy has limited treatment options.
Given the morbidity associated with this disease, there is an u rgent need to identify novel 
therapies to improve the outcome of patients with advanced chem o-refractory gastric and GEJ 
cancer. The poor survival rates seen with this disease may in pa rt be related to a lack of standard 
recommendations for second-line therapy.  
2.2 CANCER STEM CELLS (CSC) AND GASTRIC AND GEJ CANCER
CSCs or cancer cells with stemness phenotypes are a sub-populat ion of cancer cells that have 
self-renewal capability, are highly malignant, and are consider ed to be fundamentally responsible 
for malignant growth, recurrence, drug-resistance and metastasi s. Moreover, CSCs are highly 
resistant to traditional chemotherapies and current targeted ag ents. CSCs have been isolated from 
almost all major tumor types, including gastric cancer [Takaishi 2007A] . Targeting stem cells, 
therefore, holds great promise for fundamentally advancing canc er treatment.
Accumulating evidence indicates that CSCs play a key role in th e pathogenesis of gastric cancer 
[Takaishi 2008] . Cancer stem cells have been isolated from human gastric cance r using cell 
surface markers such as Lgr5 and CD44 [Barker 2010; Takaishi 2009] . These CSCs isolated 
from gastric and GEJ cancer patients display tumour-initiating properties, as well as resistance to 
chemotherapeutic agents. These findings suggest that the develo pment of cancer stem cell 
inhibitors represents a novel and compelling strategy for the t reatment of gastric and GEJ cancer. 
2.3 BBI 608 
BBI608 is the most advanced agent developed by Boston Biomedical , Inc. (BBI) to target CSCs. 
BBI608 is a small molecule that blocks self-renewal of, and ind uces cell death in CSCs isolated 
from gastric and GEJ cancer as well as other types of cancer. BBI 608 inhibits CSCs by binding to 
CSCP3, a proprietary CSC target discovered by scientists at Bos ton Biomedical. CSCP3 has been 
identified as STAT3. STAT3 is a known oncogene which is aberran tly activated in a wide variety 
of human cancers including all the major carcinomas as well as some hematologic tumors.
Multiple animal models of gastric cancer support the role of ST AT3 pathway activation in this 
disease. The gp130F/F mouse model for gastric cancer results in STAT3 hyper-activation , and 
these animals spontaneously develop gastritis and gastric tumor s within 6-8 weeks [Judd 2006; 
Ernst 2008] . Another mouse model, the T3b-SOCS3 cKO mouse, develops STAT3- mediated 
gastritis and gastric tumors within 8 weeks [Inagaki-Ohara 2012]. In particular, approximately 
20 to 50% of gastric and GEJ cancers feature dysregulation of S TAT3 signaling [Yu 2009; Tye 
2012, Gong 2005; Yakata 2007] . Moreover, activation of STAT3 pathway, as assessed in 
archival patient tumor samples, has been associated with reduce d survival [Kim 2009; Yakata
2007; Gong 2005; Lee 2009; Kanda 2004] . These data provide strong rationale for the 
development of gastric and GEJ cancer therapies based on inhibi tion of STAT3 activity.
2.4 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH BBI608 IN PATIENTS WITH GASTRIC AND GE J CANCER
Based on compelling pre-clinical data, a Phase Ib/II study was i nitiated to evaluate the safety, 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and preliminary signs of activ ity of BBI608 administered in 
BBI608-336
Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-14
  
CONFIDENTIAL 11 CONFIDENTIALcombination with weekly paclitaxel in several solid tumors, inc luding gastric/GEJ cancer. This 
study showed that BBI608 can be combined safely with weekly pac litaxel, with the RP2D of 
BBI608 in this combination determined to be the full monotherap y dose (480 mg, twice daily). 
The Adverse Event (AE) profile is similar to that of both agent s in monotherapy, with no new or 
additive effects observed.  AEs possibly related to BBI608 were generally mild, consisting 
primarily of Grade 1 and 2 diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.  
To date, 7 subjects with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer have been e nrolled in this study. All 
patients had been pre-treated, with most having received multip le lines of therapy in the 
metastatic setting, including prior taxanes. The Disease Control  Rate (DCR) and Objective 
Response Rate (ORR) for BBI608 in combination with paclitaxel in the gastric/GEJ cancer
patients was found to be 6 of 7 enrolled and 3 of 7 enrolled, res pectively. Three patients had a 
partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 (100%, 45% and 48% regress ions of target lesions), and 
the additional three patients had prolonged stable disease (SD) —one with 25% regression.  
Historically, a DCR of approxima tely 40-60% and an ORR of appro ximately 5-21% have been 
observed in this setting with taxane monotherapy [Ford 2012; Graziano 2000; Kodera 2007; 
Hironaka 2013;Wilke 2014]. Furthermore, for these patients, median Progression Free Surviv al 
(PFS) was approximately 23 weeks,  which compares favorably with the median PFS (11.4
weeks) observed with weekly paclitaxel alone [Wilke 2014] . The phase II portion of the trial is 
ongoing, with enriched accrual of patients with previously treat ed gastric and GEJ cancer.
Currently, BBI608 combined with weekly paclitaxel has been admi nistered safely to more than 
80 patients with various solid tumors.
The unmet clinical need, mechanism of action of BBI608, and enco uraging pre-clinical and 
clinical data seen to date provide a strong rationale for furth er investigation of BBI608 in 
combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with advanced ga stric and GEJ cancer. 
2.5 SUMMARY
BBI608-336 will primarily examine the effect of adding treatmen t with CSC inhibitor BBI608 to 
weekly paclitaxel on Overall Surv ival in patients with advanced Gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma 
who have failed first line chemotherapy. Additional assessments will include Progression-Free 
Survival, Objective Response Rate, Disease Control Rate, Safety , Quality of life (QoL), 
Population Pharmacokinetics and putative predictive molecular m arkers.

CONFIDENTIAL 12 CONFIDENTIAL3BACKGROUND THERAPEUTIC INFORMATION
3.1 NAME AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION
BBI608 
3.2 MECHANISM OF ACTION
BBI608 is a cancer stem cell (CSC) inhibitor. One of the hallma rks of CSCs is their ability to 
self-renew [Al-Hajj 2004] .A standard method of measuring self-renewal capacity is to asse ss the 
ability of CSCs to be cultured as spheres in the absence of ser um or attachment [Ponti 2005; Cho 
2008] .Treatment with BBI608 potently blocks in vitro sphere formation by gastric CSCs, as well 
as other types of CSCs. Moreover, BBI608 has also been shown to  target CSCs in vivo .
Treatment of nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts with BBI6 08 has been shown to reduce 
their CSC content by 4 to 5-fold after two weeks of treatment. This observation has been made in 
xenografted gastric cancer, as well as other cancer models. In contrast, treatment of xenograft-
bearing mice with 5-FU and platinum-based agents led to an incre ased concentration of CSCs in 
the xenografts. Thus, BBI608 has been shown highly effective aga inst CSCs in vitro  and in vivo .
BBI608 targets CSCs by inhibiting STAT3, a proprietary target i dentified by Boston Biomedical. 
Scientists at Boston Biomedical have discovered that STAT3 is c ritical for the self-renewal and 
survival of cancer stem cells. Under normal conditions, STAT3 a ctivation is transient and tightly 
regulated in normal adult cells and adult stem cells. While ess ential for embryonic development, 
STAT3 deficiency is well tolerated in adult mice [Niwa 1998] .Moreover, conditional knock-out 
of STAT3 in mice is associated with undetectable or mild phenot ypes [Akira 1999] .Patients with 
Job’s syndrome also survive wel l with STAT3 dominant negative m utations [Holland 2007] .  
Increased levels of phospho-STAT3, the activated form of STAT3,  are observed in both 
preclinical gastric cancer models as well as in human gastric c ancer. Multiple animal models of 
gastric cancer support the role of STAT3 pathway activation in this disease. The gp130F/F mouse 
model for gastric cancer results in STAT3 hyperactivation and t hese animals spontaneously 
develop gastritis and gastric tumors within 6-8 weeks [Judd 2006; Ernst 2008] . In another mouse 
model, the T3b-SOCS3 cKO mouse, develops STAT3-mediated gastrit i s  a n d  g a s t r i c  t u m o r s  
within 8 weeks [Inagaki-Ohara 2012].  Approximately 20 to 50% of gastric and GEJ cancers 
feature dysregulation of STAT3 signaling [Yu 2009; Tye 2012, Gong 2005; Yakata 2007] .  
Moreover, activation of STAT3 pathway, as assessed in archival patient tumor samples, has been 
associated with lower patient survival [Kim 2009; Yakata 2007; Gong 2005; Lee 2009; Kanda 
2004] . These data demonstrate that STAT3 is an important regulator of  gastric and GEJ cancer 
proliferation and survival, as well as a key regulator of CSC-m ediated invasion and metastasis. 
Moreover, they establish a powerful rationale for the developme nt of gastric and GEJ cancer 
therapies based on inhibition of STAT3 activity. 
STAT3 is closely linked to another important transcription fact or RQFRJHQH ȕ -catenin, the 
HIIHFWRURIWKH:QWVLJQDOOLQJSDWKZD\ȕ -catenin contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis in a 
wide range of cancers including gastric and GEJ cancer. It has b een shown that constitutive 
activation of the E-catenin allele in mouse gastric epithelium leads to adenoma fo rmation in the 
stomach antrum as well as adenomatous change in the more proxim al stomach [Radulescu 2013] 
supporting the idea that Wnt pathway activation may play a role  in the initiation of gastric and 
BBI608-336

CONFIDENTIAL 13 CONFIDENTIALGEJ cancer. Additionally, mouse models of gastric cancer show t hat induction of Wnt signalling 
synergistically cooperates with inflammatory signalling pathway s to promote tumor development 
in gastric mucosa of the animals [Oshima 2006] . Moreover, Lgr5, a recognized gastric cancer 
stem cell marker, is a Wnt pathway target gene [Van der Flier LG 2007] , and increased Wnt 
signalling leads to accumulation of Lgr5 positive self-renewing , multi-potent stem cells 
responsible for long term renewal of the gastric epithelium [Barker 2010] .
In addition to the over- H[SUHVVLRQ RI ȕ -catenin, its localization has important clinical 
implications. 0HPEUDQRXVȕ -catenin is involved in maintaining cell-cell junctions and pro moting 
a less-aggressive epithelial phenotype. By contrast, nu FOHDUȕ -catenin is accumulated in human 
gastric cancer tumors [Brabletz 2005, Clements 2002, Nakatsuru 1992, Park 1999] and has been 
correlated with an invasive phenotype in intestinal-type gastri c cancers [Miyazawa 2000] .
Although nuclear E-catenin translocation (with or without demonstrated E-catenin mutations) has 
been reported in gastric cancer, the actual incidence has varie d greatly among studies with 
approximately 30-50% of tumors showing nuclear accumulation of E-catenin [Clements 2002, 
Park 1999, Ebert 2002] .  
A US based study evaluating 311 gastric cancers reported that ap proximately one third of all 
gastric tumors show E-catenin nuclear localization, with E-catenin mutations occurring equally 
among the diffuse and intestinal types of gastric and GEJ cancer  [Clements 2002] .AK o r e a n  
study looking at 598 gastric cancer samples reported nuclear E-catenin incidence of 20% in 
intestinal gastric cancer and 84% in diffuse type of gastric ca ncer, with 86% of more advanced 
stage gastric cancers of both histologic types exhibiting nucle ar E-catenin staining. A separate 
s t u d y  r e p o r t e d 2 4 %  o f  e a r l y  s t a g e  g a s t r i c  c a n c e r s  a n d 8 0 %  o f  l y m p h node metastases of both 
histologic types of gastric cancer showing nuclear E-catenin translocation [Kim 2009] . A recent 
study from China looking at 144 gastric cancer samples reported a nuclear E-catenin frequency of 
56% with presence of nuclear E-catenin denoting a worse prognosis for overall survival [Liu 
2012].  A 1997 study evaluating 89 gastric carcinomas reported a statis tically significant 3-5 fold 
survival advantage in patients retaining normal membranous E-catenin staining irrespective of 
histologic type, grade or stage of gastric cancer [Jawhari 1997] . Although the reported incidence 
of nuclear E-catenin staining varies in the literature, these studies demon strate the presence of 
abnormally elevated levels of nuclear E-catenin in gastric and GEJ cancer and correlate nuclear E-
catenin localization with more advanced disease as well as decr eased survival.  This provides a 
strong rationale for the development of gastric and GEJ cancer therapies with effects on E-catenin 
nuclear localization.  
Studies conducted at Boston Biomedical have shown that BBI608 c an directly inhibit 
phosphorylated STAT3, and also blocks the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 in cancer cells. 
Moreover, treatment of cancer cells with BBI608 inhibits STAT3 reporter gene activity in a dose-
dependent manner. The ability of BBI608 to inhibit STAT3 nuclea r translocation in 
heterogeneous cancer cells and CSCs has also been demonstrated by in vivo  immunofluorescence 
studies. BBI608 treatment was also found to result in decreased  STAT3-dependent gene 
H[SUHVVLRQLQFDQFHUFHOOVLQFOXGLQJȕ -catenin. Furthermore, BBI608 has been shown to decrease 
ȕ-catenin levels in in vivo gastric cancer models (BBI’s unpublished data).

CONFIDENTIAL 14 CONFIDENTIAL3.3 EXPERIMENTAL ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY
BBI608 also exhibits strong effects against CSCs isolated from gastric cancer and various cancer 
types (IC 50~100 to 500 nM) while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells ( IC50not reached at 
30PM). These data suggest a wide (>50-fold) therapeutic window for  BBI608. Additionally, 
since bulk cancer cell progeny retain dependency on STAT3 as CS Cs, BBI608 has demonstrated 
inhibitory activities against a broad spectrum of heterogeneous cancer cells including those 
derived from pancreas, lung, cervix, breast, colon, head and ne ck, and prostate, as well as 
hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma, leukemia , and lymphoma (with IC 50
values of ~100 nM to 500 nM).  
BBI608 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity as a monothe rapy in vivo in murine 
xenograft models of human gastric cancer. No treatment-related signs of toxicity were noted. 
BBI608 has also shown potent anti-tumor activity in a variety o f other human cancer xenograft 
models including colorectal (including k-Ras mutant), pancreatic, head and neck, breast, prostate, 
and liver cancer.  
Combined therapy with BBI608 and other anti-cancer agents has a lso been investigated in vivo .
Significant synergy has been observed between BBI608 and chemot herapeutic agents, including 
paclitaxel, in a variety of murine xenograft models of human can cer including gastric, CRC, 
breast, non-small cell lung cancer, head/neck cancer, and ovari an cancer. These data suggest a 
significant potential for BBI608 in combination with chemothera peutic agents for a wide variety 
of human cancers. 
3.4 GLP TOXICOLOGY STUDIES (28-DAY & 90-DAY)
BBI608 was evaluated in 28-day repeat-dose GLP toxicology studi es in both rats and dogs. Both 
species received BBI608 at dose levels of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/ day for 28 days followed by a 
14-day recovery period. In both species, adverse events were ob served in the high dose (100 
mg/kg) groups. Male rats in the 100 mg/kg group showed body wei ght loss, diarrhea, and 
decreased food consumption. Female rats in the 100 mg/kg group experienced weight loss only, 
which stabilized after the first week. In dogs in the 100 mg/kg g roup, weight loss, emesis, 
diarrhea, and soft/mucoid feces were observed in both males and  females. Clinical pathology and 
histopathology findings in rats at high dose were consistent wi th dehydration and diarrhea. There 
were no related pathologic or hist opathological findings in dog s at any dose level.  
Under the conditions of the study, the 28-day oral NOAEL (no ob served adverse effects level) in 
both rats and dogs was 30 mg/kg. From the rat NOAEL, conversion  to a human equivalent dose 
(HED) yields 180 mg/m2; and from the dog NOAEL, the HED is 600 mg/m2. This dose 
corresponded to BBI608 plasma levels in both species above the in vitro IC50, with exposure 
lasting beyond 10 hours.

Dawley rats (at doses of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg/day) and Beagle dog s (at doses of 10, 30 or 100 
mg/kg/day) by oral gavage or capsule dosing, respectively, follo wed by a 28-day recovery period. 
Clinical observations, body wei ghts, food consumption, and clin ical pathology and 
histopathology were evaluated. There were no test article-relate d clinical observations in rats at 
any dose level. Test article-related effects included decreased bo dy weight gain for male and 
female rats receiving 40 mg/kg/day. Test article-related organ w eight changes at study day (SD) 
91 were limited to increased relative (to body weight) mean spleen  weight (21.7%), in male rats
receiving 40 mg/kg/day. Clinical pathology changes included mini mal decreases in total protein, 
albumin, and calcium in males and females given 40 mg/kg/day, a nd minimal to mild increases in
total white blood cell counts and associated absolute neutrophi l and absolute lymphocyte counts
in males and females given 40 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related micr oscopic findings in rats given 
40 mg/kg/day included: minimal to mild transitional epithelial hyperplasia and vacuolation in the 
urinary bladder; minimal to moderate epithelial hyperplasia, hyp erkeratosis, inflammatory cell 
infiltrates and edema in the non-glandular stomach; minimal to mild erythropoiesis and 
pigmented macrophages in the spleen; and minimal to moderate me dullary sinus mastocytosis, 
erythrocytosis and pigmented macrophages in mesenteric lymph no des.  
In dogs at all dose levels, there were no test article-related cha nges, including clinical 
observation, body weight, clinical pathology and histopathology . Treatment with BBI608 had no 
effect on ophthalmology, no treatment-related effects on any EC G parameters, and all ECGs were 
considered qualitatively and quantitatively normal for Beagle d ogs.
Under the conditions of the study, the NOAEL level (based on clin ical observation, laboratory 
tests, gross and histopathological changes) for rats administer ed BBI608 daily orally for 90 days 
was 20 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 120 mg/m2), and the NOAEL in dogs administered 
BBI608 daily orally for 90 days was 100 mg/kg/day (human equiva lent dose: 2000 mg/m2).
3.5 PHASE I TRIAL OF BBI608 MONOTHERAPY
The effects of BBI608 in humans have been evaluated in a phase I  clinical trial, BBI608-101 
(IND 100,887). The trial was a dose-escalation study designed t o examine the safety, tolerability, 
and pharmacokinetics of BBI608 in patients with advanced malign ancies of all types, whose 
cancer had progressed following standard therapy, or for whom n o effective standard therapy was 
available. The preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 was als o examined.  
In the dose escalation portion, 14 cohorts (N=41) were dosed from 20 mg to 2000 mg/day.  
Adverse events were generally mild, including grade 1-2 diarrhe a, nausea, anorexia and fatigue 
with a total of 4 grade 3 events (diarrhea and fatigue). MTD wa s not reached. At 400 mg/day the 
plasma concentration of BBI608 was sustained at a concentration > 1.5 uM (several fold above 
the IC 50) for >8 hours.  RP2D was determined to be 500 mg bid. Among tho s e  e v a l u a b l e  f o r  
tumor response (RECIST 1.1), disease control (disease stabiliza tion and regression) was observed 
in 65% of patients. Prolonged time to progression was observed i n  4 6 %  o f  e v a l u a b l e  p a t i e n t s ,  
including patients with colorectal (CRC), head & neck, gastric,  ovarian, melanoma, and breast 
cancer. Decreases in tumor markers (CEA and CA125) were also obs erved in colon cancer and 
ovarian cancer, respectively.

CONFIDENTIAL 16 CONFIDENTIAL3.6 PHASE IB/II TRIAL OF BBI608 AND PACLITAXEL
A Phase Ib/II study was initiated to evaluate the safety, recom mended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and 
preliminary signs of activity of BBI608 administered in combina tion with weekly paclitaxel in 
several solid tumors, including gastric/GEJ cancer. This study s howed that BBI608 can be 
combined safely with weekly paclitaxel, with an RP2D of BBI608 i n this combination determined 
to be the full monotherapy dose (480 mg, twice daily). The Adve rse Event (AE) profile is similar 
to that of both agents in monotherapy, with no new or additive effects observed.  AE attributed to 
BBI608 were generally mild, consisting primarily of Grade 1 and 2  diarrhea, nausea and 
vomiting. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BBI608 and paclitaxel were examined in the patients enrolled 
during the phase Ib portion of this study, at BBI608 doses from 4 00 to 1000 mg total daily dose. 
No significant difference in plasma exposures were noted with t he addition of paclitaxel in 
comparison to PK data from the BBI608 monotherapy Phase I study .  
To date, 7 subjects with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer have been e nrolled in this study. All 
patients were pre-treated, with most having received multiple l ines of therapy in the m etastatic 
setting, including prior taxanes. 
The Disease Control Rate (DCR) and Objective Response Rate (ORR ) for BBI608 in 
combination with paclitaxel in the gastric/GEJ cancer patients w as found to be 6 of 7 enrolled and 
3 of 7 enrolled, respectively. Three patients had a partial resp onse (PR) per RECIST 1.1 (100%, 
45% and 48% regressions of target lesions), and the additional three patients had prolonged stable 
disease (SD)—one with 25% regression.  The phase II portion of the trial is ongoing, with 
enriched accrual of patients with previously treated gastric an d GEJ cancer. Currently, BBI608 
combined with weekly paclitaxel has been administered safely to  more than 80 patients.

In the BBI608-201 trial of BBI608 and weekly paclitaxel, the AE p rofile was similar to that of 
both BBI608 and paclitaxel in m onotherapy, with no new, worsene d or additive effects observed.
As seen in Table 1 below, the most frequent AEs were gastrointe stinally-related, most frequently 
Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. No subjects experienced Grade 4 symptoms. Other non-GI-related 
events included sequelae likely secondary to GI events, such fa tigue and dehydration.

Diarrhea
The onset of diarrheal symptoms has been observed to occur pred ominantly during the first week 
of dosing. The diarrhea is non-bloody, non-inflammatory, and li kely osmotic in etiology due to 
un-dissolved drug product in the gastrointestinal lumen. Symptom s can also be associated with 
abdominal cramping, though this is not the rule. As a result of  the etiology of the diarrhea, oral 
fluids have been found to be helpful in preventing or alleviati ng these symptoms.  
Aggressive up-front management with anti-diarrheal agents is eff ective and recommended, and 
combination therapy may be particularly useful. If needed, a br ief dosing holiday of 1-2 days will 
promptly improve symptoms, often resolving them completely. Pat ients should then be re-
challenged with BBI608. If symptoms happen to recur, a milder c ourse can be expected.

CONFIDENTIAL 18 CONFIDENTIALNausea, Vomiting, Anorexia, and Weight Loss 
Nausea, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss have also been observe d during treatment with 
BBI608. Symptoms often respond well to supportive management or  are reversible upon 1 to 3
days of dosing holiday. Management with a 5HT 3 receptor antagonist anti-emetic, or oral 
corticosteroids if needed, is effective. More traditional anti- histamine or dopamine antagonist 
anti-emetic can also be tried. Similar to observed diarrhea, the se symptoms are also likely due to 
un-dissolved drug product in the gastrointestinal lumen. Oral fl uids have been found to be helpful 
in preventing or alleviating these symptoms.
For detailed instructions on the management of treatment-associ ated diarrhea and other 
gastrointestinal symptoms, please refer to section 8.1.6.

The trial population will consist of subjects with advanced (me tastatic or locally advanced and
unresectable) cytological or histologically confirmed gastric an d GEJ adenocarcinoma. Subjects 
will have failed treatment with one regimen containing a fluoro pyrimidine and a platinum-based 
agent in the metastatic setting. 
5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA
Questions about eligibility criteria should be addressed prior torandomization. 
The eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully con sidered. Eligibility criteria are 
standards used to ensure that patients who enter this study are  medically appropriate candidates 
for this therapy, as well as to ensure that the results of this  study can be useful for making 
treatment decisions regarding other patients with similar disea ses. 
Patients must fulfill all of the following criteria to be eligi ble for admission to the study:
5.1.1 Written, signed consent for trial participation must be o btained from the patient appropriately in 
accordance with applicable ICH guidelines and local and regulat ory requirements prior to the 
performance of any study specific procedure.
5.1.2  Must have cytologically or histologically confirmed adva nced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
that is metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable (with u nresectability as defined by  
National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines for Gastric Ca ncer [Version 2.2013] and 
Esophageal and Esophagogastric J unction Cancer [Version 2.2013] ). GEJ cancers may include 
Siewert Class I, II or III types [Siewert 1996] . 
5.1.3 Must have failed treatment with one regimen containing at least a platinum/fluoropyrimidine 
doublet for unresectable or metastatic disease. While not mandat ed, concomitant treatment with 
an anthracycline (epirubicin or doxorubicin) or anti-HER2 therapy  (trastuzumab) in this setting is 
allowed. Patients who have progression of disease at any point during neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
treatment with a platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet or < 6 month s after the last dose of 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment may be enrolled. 
  
Treatment failure is defined as progression of disease (clinica l or radiologic) during first line 
treatment for unresectable or metastatic disease RU  6 m o n t h s  a f t e r  l a s t  d o s e  o f  f i r s t  l i n e  
treatment. 
No additional prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting wil l be allowed. A patient who has 
received neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, relapsed, and then received a 
platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet as first-line treatment in the unresectable/metastatic setting 
would be allowed, however. 
Patients who have received prior taxane therapy may be enrolled , so long as the taxane was 
administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting and progres sion occurred more than 6 months 
following completion of therapy. Patients who were intolerant t o paclitaxel are not allowed, 
however.

Patients will be randomized 1:1 between the two treatment arms and the randomization will be 
provided electronically (via RTSM). 
Note: The validity of results of the trial depends on the authe nticity of, and the follow-up of, all 
patients entered into the trial. Under no circumstances, theref ore, may an allocated patient’s data 
be withdrawn prior to final analysis, unless the participant wi thdraws from the trial and requests 
that data collection/submission cease from the point in time of  withdrawal. 
All eligible patients randomized to the trial will be followed b y the coordinating center. It is the 
responsibility of the physician in charge to satisfy himself or herself that the patient is indeed 
eligible before requesting randomization.
All randomized patients are to be followed until death or until  sites are informed by the study 
sponsor that further follow-up is no longer required.

Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient  randomization. 
8.1 TREATMENT PLAN
Palliative and supportive care for other disease-related sympto ms and for toxicity associated with 
treatment will be offered to all patients on this trial. Detail s of interventions (e.g. medications 
such as antibiotics, analgesics, antihistamines, steroids, G-CS F, erythropoietin), procedures (e.g. 
paracentesis, thoracentesis), or blood products (e.g. blood cel ls, platelets, or fresh frozen plasma 
transfusions) should be recorded on the case report forms.
8.1.1 BBI608 Adverse Event Prophylaxis 
Gastrointestinal Prophylaxis 
The major adverse events associated with the use of BBI608 are g astrointestinal events (nausea, 
diarrhea, and abdominal cramping) and fatigue. Fatigue is often  secondary to gastrointestinal 
events. There is no hematologic toxicity associated with BBI608 . We recommend that pre-exiting 
laxative bowel regimens, such as stool softeners, be held starti ng the day prior to first dose of 
study treatment and may be resumed in cases of no bowel movemen t during the first 2 days of

Patients will receive BBI608 or placebo two times daily, approxim ately one hour prior to or two 
hours after meals, with the first dose given in the morning and  the second dose given 
approximately 12 hours later.
Paclitaxel will be administered via IV at 80 mg/m2once weekly as approximately a 1-hour 
infusion, on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day study cycle. Pacli taxel will be administered at least 
2 hours after the first daily dose of BBI608/Placebo. Paclitaxel a dministration should proceed
based on body surface area (BSA) according to the manufacturer’s  instructions and local standard 
practice (with respect to pre-treatment laboratory evaluation, c linical assessment, pre-medication, 
and monitoring during and after the infusion). The BSA of an ind ividual can be calculated from 
the formula of Dubois [BSA (m 2) = Body weight (kg) 0.425X Height (cm) 0.725 X 0.007184]. 
If paclitaxel is permanently discontinued due to toxicity, BBI6 08/Placebo should be continued as 
monotherapy until September 15 2017 or until another criterion for stopping treatment is met,
whichever occurs first. If BBI608/Placebo is permanently discont inued due to toxicity, paclitaxel 
should be continued as monotherapy until September 15 2017 or u ntil another criterion for

As BBI608 targets cancer stem cells, it is possible that contin ued therapy after progressive 
disease per RECIST 1.1 may provide clinical benefit. If no othe r standard therapies are available 
at the time of disease progression, and the patient has not exp erienced any adverse events 
requiring permanent discontinuation, BBI608/Placebo may be conti nued in monotherapy as long

8.1.4 Patient Monitoring
For the duration that patients are on study therapy, adverse ev ent monitoring will be done 
continuously. Patients will be evaluated for adverse events at each visit, and are to be instructed 
to call their physician to report any adverse events between vi sits.
8.1.5 BBI608/Placebo Dose Modification  
The major adverse events associated with the use of BBI608 are g astrointestinal issues (nausea, 
diarrhea, and abdominal cramping) and fatigue. Fatigue is often  secondary to gastrointestinal 
events. There is no hematologic toxicity associated with BBI608 . We recommend that standing 
bowel regimens, such as stool softeners, be held at start of st udy and may be resumed in cases of 
no bowel movement during the first 2 days of protocol treatment . Fiber supplementation may be 
continued.  
The guidelines which follow outline dosing modifications and rec ommended interventions should 
the above adverse events occur. 
Adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0 (see Appendix III).  If a patient experiences  several adverse events and 
there are conflicting recommendations, please use the recommend ed dose adjustment that reduces 
the dose to the lowest level.
8.1.5.1 Hematologic Adverse Events
No hematologic toxicity related to BBI608 treatment has been ob served. Should a study subject 
experience a Grade 1 or 2 hematologic adverse event, dosing may  continue while an alternate 
explanation is sought and/or a therapeutic intervention is unde rtaken.  
In the unlikely event of a Grade 3 or 4 hematologic adverse eve nt related to BBI608/placebo, 
please contact the study Medical monitor, so that together with  the study Investigator, the 
Medical Monitor can make recommendations on medical management.  S i n c e  a  G r a d e  3  o r  4  
hematologic event attributed to BBI608 has not been reported, a  prompt evaluation for an 
alternate explanation is strongly recommended.

Change in Urine Color and Odor: 
Occasionally, subjects have reported an orange-brown color chan ge to their urine. Rarely, 
subjects also report a new odor to their urine. All subjects sh ould be made aware of the possibility 
of these effects. Patients can be reassured that these effects h ave no long term consequences, and 
that the effects are completely reversible. Dosing can be conti nued in the presence of these 
events. 
8.1.6 Paclitaxel Dose Modification
Prior to each dose of paclitaxel, the absolute neutrophil count  (ANC) and platelet count should be 
evaluated. If abnormalities are observed, and in the opinion of the investigator the 
myelosupression is most likely a result of paclitaxel therapy, dose modification should occur in

The paclitaxel dose should be reduced by one or more dose level s if the dose is held more than 
once during a 4 week cycle. 
For patients who experience a grade 3 non-hematologic adverse e vent (except alopecia), and in 
the opinion of the investigator the event is most likely a resul t of paclitaxel therapy, the dose of 
paclitaxel should be held until the adverse event has improved to grade 2, and then reduced by 
one or more dose levels for subsequent doses of paclitaxel.

** If paclitaxel dose is required to be reduced below 40 mg/m2, or if any life-threatening paclitaxel-related events occur, 
paclitaxel should be permanently discontinued.
When laboratory parameters indicate that the dose of paclitaxel  should be delayed, the 
infusion of paclitaxel scheduled for that day is not given.  Th e infusion is considered 
“missed”, and is not made up at another time.  The next paclita xel infusion would be 
according to the protocol specified administration schedule.  L aboratory parameters should be 
evaluated prior to the next scheduled dose of paclitaxel and ac tions taken according to the 
protocol parameters.
If a toxicity is thought by the Investigator to be related to b oth BBI608/Placebo and paclitaxel, 
then the dose modification rules for both agents should be foll owed.

8.1.7 Concomitant Medications/Procedures 
Permitted Treatments:
All information regarding concomitant treatments (medications o r procedures) must be recorded 
on the patient’s CRF (including the name of the medication or p rocedure and duration of 
treatment). 
As per the Summary of Product Characteristics for paclitaxel, a lthough CYP2C8 inhibitors or 
inducers are permitted, caution should be exercised when co-adm inistering these agents with 
paclitaxel. Similarly, caution should be exercised while co-adm inistering CYP1A2 inhibitors 
and/or substrates of CYP e nzymes 1A2, 2D6, 2C19 a nd 3A4 with BB I608. 
Palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms wil l be offered to all patients. 
All palliative and supportive care measures may be administered  to patients in either study arm at 
the Investigator’s discretion. Incident palliative radiotherapy  is permitted in both study arms 
while on study, but requirement of radiation to the target lesi on(s) will qualify the patient as 
having disease progression.
Although patients will have either metastatic or locally advanc ed but unresectable disease at 
randomization, it is possible that a patient’s tumor may become  operable over the course of 
treatment. Resection is allowed, and it is recommended that pac litaxel be held for 1 week prior to 
the surgery and 2 weeks after the surgery, or until post-surgic al recovery, whichever is longer.
BBI608 should be held 24 hours pri or to the surgery to 1 week aft er the surgery as tolerated. 
Non-Permitted Treatments:
Concurrent chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (except corticosteroids ), immunotherapy, biologic 
therapy OR other experimental agents should not be given to stu dy patients while on protocol 
treatment. 
8.1.8 Duration of Therapy
Patients may continue to receive protocol therapy until Septembe r 15 2017 as long as they have 
not experienced any adverse events requiring permanent disconti nuation of protocol treatment
and have not demonstrated disease progression based on RECIST 1 .1 criteria. For details

CONFIDENTIAL 42 CONFIDENTIAL10CRITERIA FOR MEASUREMENT OF STUDY ENDPOINTS
10.1 DEFINITIONS
10.1.1 Evaluable for Adverse Events: All patients who have received at least one dose of 
BBI608/placebo will be evaluable for adverse events from the ti me of their first dose of 
BBI608/placebo. 
10.1.2 Evaluable for Overall Survival (OS): All randomized patients will be included in the analysis of 
OS, which is defined as the time interval between the date of r andomization and the date of death 
from any cause. Patients who are still alive at the time of the  final analysis, or who have become
lost to follow-up will be censored at their last date known to be alive.  
10.1.3 Evaluable for Progression Free Survival (PFS): All randomized patients will be included in the 
analysis of PFS, which is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the 
date of objective disease progression or death, whichever comes  first. If neither event has been 
observed, then the patient will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.
Disease progression is defined as objective progression per REC IST 1.1 [Eisenhauer 2009] .I t  i s  
required to perform, whenever possible, a radiological confirma tion of the clinical suspicion of 
tumor progression. In the situation where there is clinical sus picion of progression but objective 
progression cannot be determined per RECIST 1.1, disease is def ined as clinical deterioration 
without objective evidence of progression.  
The date of disease progression is defined as the date when the  criteria for objective progression 
are first met. 
10.1.4 Evaluable for Objective Response Rate (ORR): Patients with measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 
at randomization will be included in the analysis of ORR which is  defined as a composite of 
Partial Response and Complete Response as classified according to the definitions set out below 
[Eisenhauer 2009] .For patients who discontinue protocol therapy prior to their fi rst objective 
assessment of response, it is imperative that an objective resp onse assessment be undertaken as 
close to the protocol specified schedule as possible. 
10.1.5 Evaluable for Disease Control Rate (DCR): Patients who have measurable disease by RECIST 
1.1 at randomization will be included in the analysis of DCR whi ch is defined as a composite of 
Stable Disease, Partial Response and Complete Response as classi fied according to the 
definitions set out below [Eisenhauer 2009]. For patients who di scontinue protocol therapy prior 
to their first objective assessment of response, it is imperati ve that an objective response 
assessment be undertaken as close to the protocol specified sch edule as possible.
10.1.6 Evaluable for Quality of Life Assessment: All patients who have completed the baseline quality of 
life questionnaire and at least one other QoL questionnaire are  evaluable.
10.2 RESPONSE AND EVALUATION ENDPOINTS
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised international criteria 
(1.1) proposed by the RECIST (R esponse Evaluation Criteria in S olid Tumors) committee.
BBI608-336
Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-14
  
CONFIDENTIAL 43 CONFIDENTIAL10.2.1 Measurable Disease: Measurable tumor lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimen sion (longest di ameter to be reco rded) as > 20 mm with chest x-ray 
and as > 10 mm with CT scan, or clinical examination. Bone lesi ons are considered measurable 
only if assessed by CT scan and have an identifiable soft tissu e component that meets these 
requirements (soft tissue component > 10 mm by CT scan). Malignant lymph nodes must be > 
15mm in the short axis to be considered measurable; only the sh ort axis will be measured and 
followed. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeter s (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters). Previously irradiated lesions are not considered measurable unless progression has 
been documented in the lesion. 
10.2.2 Non-measurable Disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesion s are 
considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions without a measu rable soft tissue component, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions,  lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of lung o r  s k i n  a n d  a b d o m i n a l  m a s s e s  
followed by clinical examination are all non-measurable. Lesion s in previously irradiated areas 
are non-measurable, unless progression has been demonstrated.
10.2.3 Target Lesions: When more than one measurable tumor lesion is present at baseli ne all lesions up 
to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ ) representative of all 
involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will  be recorded and measured at 
baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of the ir size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in add ition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . Note that pathological nodes must meet the 
criterion of a short axis of > 15 mm by CT scan and only the short axis of these nodes will 
contribute to the baseline sum. All other pathological nodes (t hose with short axis > 10 mm but <
15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have  a  s h o r t  a x i s  < 1 0  m m  a r e  
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or follo wed (see 10.2.4). At baseline, the 
sum of the target lesions (longest diameter of tumor lesions pl us short axis of lymph nodes: 
overall maximum of 5) is to be recorded. 
After baseline, a value should be provided on the CRF for all i dentified target lesions for each 
assessment, even if very small. If extremely small and faint le sions cannot be accurately 
measured but are deemed to be present, a default value of 5 mm may be used. If lesions are too 
small to measure and indeed are believed to be absent, a defaul t value of 0 mm may be used. 
10.2.4 Non-target Lesions: All non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any measu rable lesions 
over and above those listed as target lesions are considered  non-target lesions . Measurements are 
not required but these lesions should be noted at baseline and s hould be followed as “present” or 
“absent”.
10.2.5 Response: All patients will have their BEST RESPONSE from the start of st udy treatment until 
the end of treatment classified as outlined below: 
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of target  and non-target . Pathological lymph nodes 
must have short axis measures < 10 mm (Note: continue to record  the measurement even if < 10 
mm and considered CR). Residual lesions (other than nodes < 10 mm) thought to be non-
malignant should be further investigated (by cytology specializ ed imaging or other techniques as 
appropriate for individual cases [Eisenhauer 2009] ) before CR can be accepted. 
Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of me asures (longest diameter for

unequivocal progression of non-target disease may be accepted a s evidence of disease 
progression, where the overall tumor burden has increased suffi ciently to merit discontinuation of 
treatment or where the tumor burden appears to have increased by  at least 73% in volume. 
Modest increases in the size of one or more non-target lesions are NOT considered unequivocal 
progression. If the evidence of PD is equivocal (target or non- target), treatment may continue 
until the next assessment, but if confirmed, the earlier date m ust be used.

treatment.
10.3 RESPONSE DURATION
BBI608-336
Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-14
  
CONFIDENTIAL 45 CONFIDENTIALResponse duration will be measured from the time measurement cr iteria for CR/PR (whichever is 
first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurre nt or progressive disease is objectively 
documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recor ded on study (including 
baseline).
10.4 STABLE DISEASE DURATION
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of rando mization until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on st udy (including baseline).
10.5 METHODS OF MEASUREMENT
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up . Assessments should be identified 
on a calendar schedule and should not be affected by delays in therapy. While on study, all 
lesions recorded at baseline should have their actual measureme nts recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). If it is the opin ion of the radiologist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a defa ult value of 5 mm should be 
assigned. For lesions which fragment/split add together the lon gest diameters of the fragmented 
portions; for lesions which coalesce, measure the maximal longe st diameter for the “merged 
lesion”. 
Additionally, for optimal tumor assessment scanning options are  listed below in the decreasing   
order of preference:
Order of Preference Scanning Option
1 Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis CT with oral and I.V. contrast
2 Chest CT without I.V. contrast PLUS MRI Abdomen-Pelvis with or al 
and I.V. contrast1
3 Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis CT with oral contrast2
1If Iodine contrast media is medically contraindicated.
2If Iodine contrast media is medically contraindicated and MRI c annot be performed.
10.5.1 Clinical Lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they  are superficial 
and > 10 mm as assessed using callipers (e.g. skin nodules). Fo r the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by colour photography including a ruler to estima te the size of the lesion is 
recommended. If feasible, imaging is preferred.
10.5.2 Chest X-ray . Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when pro gression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, part icularly in identifying new lesions. 
However, lesions > 20 mm on chest X-ray may be considered measu rable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
10.5.3 CT/MRI . CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to  measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurabili ty of lesions on CT scan based on 
the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT  scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion shou ld be twice the slice thickness. 
BBI608-336
Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-14
  
CONFIDENTIAL 46 CONFIDENTIALMRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body sca ns). Other specialized im aging or 
other techniques may also be appropriate for individual case [Eisenhauer 2009] . For example, while 
PET scans are not considered adequate to measure lesions, PET-C T scans may be used providing 
that the measures are obtained from the CT scan and the CT scan is of identical diagnostic quality 
to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast). 
10.5.4 Ultrasound . Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and sho uld not be used as a 
method of measurement. If new lesions are identified by ultraso und in the course of the study, 
confirmation by CT is advised. 
10.5.5 Endoscopy/Laparoscopy . The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evalu ation is not 
advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathol ogical response when biopsies 
are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence  following complete response or 
surgical resection is an endpoint. 
10.5.6 Cytology/Histology. These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR  in rare 
cases (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as ger m cell tumors, where known 
residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any ef fusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for  response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease ( an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.

CONFIDENTIAL 47 CONFIDENTIAL11SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Ter minology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) and Seriou s Adverse Event (SAE)
reporting (version can be found in Appendix III).   
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of  the CTCAE. A copy of the 
CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm ).
All serious adverse events (SAE) defined as per ICH guidelines ( see below) and other adverse 
events must be recorded on case report forms. In addition, all “ reportable” serious adverse events 
are subject to expedited reporting to the Sponsor. The term ‘rep ortable SAE’ is used in the 
definitions which follow to describe those SAE’s which are subj ect to expedited reporting to the 
Sponsor.  
11.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING ON STUDY POST-UNBLINDING
Serious adverse events that are considered related (i.e. possib ly, probably or definitely) to 
protocol therapy must continue to be reported in an expedited m anner (see Section 10) for 
patients receiving BBI608 or paclitaxel on study after unblindi ng. 
11.2 DEFINITION OF A PROTOCOL REPORTABLE SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT
xAll serious adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner (see sec tion 11.2 for 
reporting instructions). These include events occurring from th e time the patient signs consent 
until 30 days after last protocol treatment administration. Dete rmination of relationship 
between the event and study drug  should be made by a qualified physician Investigator.  
xA serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that at any dose:
results in death;
is life-threatening;
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (excluding 
hospital admissions for study drug administration, transfusiona l support, scheduled 
elective surgery and admissions for palliative or terminal care );
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
xNOTE: Serious adverse events which are unequivocally related to  the underlying malignancy 
or disease progression do NOT require expedited reporting. These include such adverse 
events as admission for pain control, palliative care or parace ntesis of malignant effusions.
xIn addition, the following events will NOT be recorded as AEs (or SAEs):
lack of efficacy/disease progression (will be recorded separate ly on CRF);
elective hospitalization for medical, radiological or surgical procedures for treatment of 
d i s e a s e  o r  t o  s i m p l i f y  t r e a t m e n t  f o r  s t u d y  p r o c e d u r e s  ( w i l l  b e  recorded separately on

CONFIDENTIAL 48 CONFIDENTIALNote: clinically significant test results should be recorded on  the AE CRF using the appropriate 
CTCAE description and grading scale. 
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in decidin g whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical event s that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization and which are  NOT definitively related to the 
underlying malignancy or disease progression but may jeopardize  t h e  p a t i e n t  o r  m a y  r e q u i r e  
intervention to prevent one of the events listed above.  
11.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS
SAE reporting will commence following the signature of the info rmed consent and continue for 
30 days following the last dose of BBI608/Placebo. 
All protocol specified (section 11.1) reportable serious advers e events must be reported using the 
SAE Report Form for this trial. 
Within 24 hours: Submit Initial Serious Adverse Event Report 
Within 7 days: Submit Follow-up Serious Adverse Event Report upd a t e d  w i t h  a s  
much detail as possible. 
  
Detailed instructions for the submission of SAE Reports will be  provided separately.  
11.4 PROCEDURES IN CASE OF AN OVERDOSE
Use of BBI608/Placebo in doses in excess of that specified in t he protocol should be reported in 
the following manner:
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the o verdose of BBI608/Placebo, the
overdose and adverse event are reported on the SAE Report Form, ev en if no other criteria for 
serious are met. The SAE Report Form should be submitted within  24 hours. The overdose 
should also be recorded on the relevant AE form in the eCRF usi ng the term “accidental or 
intentional overdose with adverse effect.” 
If the overdose of BBI608/Placebo is not associated with an adv erse event, the overdose is 
reported as a non-serious AE, on the relevant AE form in the eC RF within 24 hours, using the 
event term “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” The Clinical Research 
Associate responsible for the investigational center should als o be notified of the event within 24 
hours. 
Investigators/site personnel are to consult the local, approved  paclitaxel product label for 
guidance on the definition of an overdose of this agent as well as for guidance on reporting of any 
AE or SAE associated with paclitaxel overdose. 
11.5 OTHER PROTOCOL REPORTABLE EVENTS – PREGNANCY/EXPOSURE REPORTING
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) may be enrolled in this  clinical trial. WOCBP are 
defined as women who have had a menstrual period during the las t year and have not had a 
hysterectomy. Precautions are required to be taken to prevent pr egnancy during the clinical trial

CONFIDENTIAL 49 CONFIDENTIALwhen the research population includes WOCBP. This includes preg nancy testing, use of effective 
methods of birth control, and preg nancy as an exclusion factor.  The trial sample informed consent 
form includes the potential for unidentified risks to the embryo/fetus. It also includes general 
information on pregnancy prevention and the required minimum pe riod during which birth 
control must be utilized.  
11.4.1 Pregnancy Prevention
WOCBP and males who are enrolled in the trial must be informed of the requirement to use 
contraception as outlined in the eligibility criteria (Section 5.1). Investigators are advised to 
inform the female partners of male participants when appropriat e and compliant with local policy.  
A highly effective method of birth c ontrol is defined as those w hich result in a failure rate of <1% 
per year when used consistently and correctly. 
11.4.2 Pregnancy Occurring in WO CBP Exposed to Study Agent 
Any female participant who becomes pregnant during the course o f the trial should be instructed 
to stop taking study medication immediately.
The investigator should provide counselling and discuss the ris ks and possible side effects to the 
embryo/fetus from BBI608 and paclitaxel. Monitoring should conti nue until conclusion of the 
pregnancy. The same should occur for female partners of a male participant, or any female 
exposed to BBI608 when appropriate and compliant with local pol icy. 
11.4.3 Pregnancy/Exposure Reporting 
The investigator is required to report to the sponsor any pregna ncy where the embryo/fetus could 
have been exposed to BBI608. This means pregnancies occurring i n female participants, female 
partners of male participants, or females exposed through direc t contact with the agent during 
their pregnancy (for example, environmental exposure involving direct contact with the agent). 
Pregnancies occurring until 30 days in female patients and unti l 90 days in partners of male 
patients, after the completion of BBI608 as well as until 6 mon ths following last paclitaxel 
infusion must also be reported.
The investigator is required to inform the Sponsor within 24 ho urs of learning of the pregnancy 
using the SAE reporting form appropriate for the trial as indic ated above. In the Adverse Event 
column please enter the following: “pregnancy, puerperium and p erinatal conditions – other, 
specify” (fetal exposure). Please note that the patient identif ication number must correspond to 
the participant in the main trial. Specifically, in the case of  pregnancy in the female partner of a 
male participant, the male participant’s patient identification  number should be used for reporting 
purposes.  
The SAE form must be updated to reflect the outcome of the preg nancy. For example: 
y“pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions – other, specif y” (normal live birth),
y“pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions – other, specif y” (therapeutic abortion), or 
yanother term under "pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditi ons" as applicable.

other applicable regulatory authorities, for those events which  meet regulatory requirements for 
expedited reporting, i.e. events which are BOTH serious AND unexp ected, AND which are 
related to protocol treatment: 
yUnexpected adverse events are those which are not consistent in either nat ure or severity 
with information contained in the Investigator’s Brochure 
yAdverse events considered related to protocol treatment are those events which lack a 
plausible alternate explanation.
Boston Biomedical will determine which SAEs meet the criteria f or regulatory reporting.  
11.7 REPORTING SAFETY REPORTS TO INVESTIGATORS
Boston Biomedical, or the delegated CRO, will notify Investigato rs of all Safety Reports (Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) from this trial and Safety Updates (SUs) from other clinical trials) that 
are reportable to regulatory authorities. This includes all ser ious events that are unexpected and 
related (i.e. possibly, probably , or definitely) to protocol tr eatment.

CONFIDENTIAL 52 CONFIDENTIAL12PROTOCOL TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION AND THERAPY AFTER STOPPING 
12.1 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUING PROTOCOL TREATMENT
Patients should stop protocol treatment in the following instan ces:
yProgressive Disease (see section 10.2.5) .
yPregnancy
yIntercurrent illness which would, in the judgement of the Inves tigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree, and require discontinu ation of protocol therapy 
yUnacceptable toxicity
yRequest by the patient
yPost-unblinding, the trial will continue at sites with patients  who have not yet met the primary 
study endpoint (death), and with patients currently on protocol  therapy who may receive 
BBI608 on study based on the clinical judgement of the investiga tor that this is in the 
patient’s best interest, providing the patient is fully informe d and provides consent (see also 
section 9.1.1 and 9.2.1). Patients will receive study treatment  until any of the discontinuation 
criteria are met or until September 15 2017, whichever occurs f irst.
If a patient discontinues protocol treatment for a reason other  than objective progression, every 
effort should be made to obtain tumor evaluations on the same s chedule until September 15 2017 
or until progression is observed, whichever occurs first.
Efforts should be made to maintain the investigations schedule and continue follow-up, even if 
patients discontinue protocol treatment prematurely and/or no l onger attend the participating 
institution. 
12.2 DURATION OF PROTOCOL TREATMENT 
Patients may continue to receive protocol therapy until Septemb er 15 2017 as long as they have 
not experienced any adverse events requiring permanent disconti nuation of study medication and 
have not demonstrated disease progression based on RECIST crite ria. 
As BBI608 targets cancer stem cells, it is possible that contin ued therapy after progressive 
disease per RECIST 1.1 may provide clinical benefit. If no othe r standard therapies are available 
at the time of disease progression, and the patient has not exp erienced any adverse events 
requiring permanent discontinuation, BBI608 may be continued in  monotherapy until September 
15 2017 as long as it is the opinion of the Investigator that t he patient may potentially be deriving 
benefit. 
12.3 THERAPY AFTER PROTOCOL TREATMENT IS STOPPED
Treatment after all protocol therapy has been discontinued is a t the discretion of the Investigator.
Information on post-study anti-cancer treatment will be collect ed in this study until September 15 
2017.

There will be no central radiology review for this study. 
13.2 CENTRAL PATHOLOGY REVIEW
There will be no central pathology review for this study. 
13.3 TISSUE COLLECTION
Protocol-Mandated Correlative Studies: 
The submission of a representative diagnostic tumor tissue and of a blood sample for correlative 
studies defined in Section 14.6 (Correlative Studies) is mandato ry for participation in this trial
(although submission of the tissue does not have to occur prior  to randomization). Where local 
center regulations prohibit submission of blocks of tumor tissue , two 2 mm cores of tumor from 
the block and 10- 30 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are requested . Where it is not 
possible to obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block, 10-3 0 unstained slides of 
representative tumor tissue are requested. Where no previously resected or biopsied tumor tissue 
exists, on the approval of the Sponsor/designated CRO, the pati ent may still be considered 
eligible for the study.
After patient consent, blood sample and paraffin tumor blocks w ill be the preferred tissue 
material to collect. If tumor blocks are unavailable, then two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block
and 10-30 specimen slides are preferred. Where it is not possib le to obtain two 2 mm  cores of 
tumor from the block, 10-30 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are also acceptable. 
If, at any time, the submitting hospital requires the block to b e returned for medical or legal 
concerns, it will be returned by courier on request. 
Samples will be used for research purposes only and will not be  sold. Patients will not be 
identified by name. The only identification of tissue will be b y a patient study number assigned at 
the time of randomization to the trial and the surgical/ histol ogy number. Material issued to 
researchers will be anonymous and only identified by a coded nu mber. 
Testing for hereditary genetic defects predisposing to malignan t disease will not be carried out 
without the expressed consent of the patient.  
All patients on whom a blood sample and/or diagnostic tumor blo ck is collected will be aware of 
this retrieval and will have given their consent.
13.4 SPARSE PHARMACOKINETIC PLASMA SAMPLE COLLECTION
Plasma samples for sparse pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis will b e obtained from all patients at

first daily dose of BBI608/Placebo, a plasma sample will be obt ained. Paclitaxel infusion will be 
started approximately 2 hours after BBI608/Placebo administrati on. A second plasma sample will 
be obtained within approximately  30 minutes after the end of th e 1 hour paclitaxel infusion.  
Day 15 (Cycle 1) Study Visit: 
On Day 15 (Cycle 1) visit, patients will be instructed to take B BI608/Placebo as normal.
Paclitaxel infusion will be given in clinic at least 2 hours aft er the BBI608/Placebo 
administration. A single plasma sample will be obtained between  2 and 4 hours after the
completion of the paclitaxel infusion.  
Day 1 (Cycle 2) Study Visit: 
On Day 1 (Cycle 2) visit, patients will be instructed to take BBI 608/Placebo as normal. Paclitaxel 
infusion will be given in clinic at least 2 hours after the BBI 608/Placebo administration. A single 
plasma sample will be obtained between 5 and 7 hours after the c ompletion of the paclitaxel 
infusion. 
For all days during which a plasma sample is obtained for PK an alysis, the precise time of all 
doses of BBI608/Placebo (on the day of sampling and the day pri or), the precise time of the 
initiation of paclitaxel administration, and the precise time o f all PK sampling must be captured.  
Samples will be processed, stored and shipped according to the instructions provided in the

Detailed methodology for summary a nd statistical analyses of th e data collected in this 
study will be documented in a sta tistical analysi s plan (SAP), which will be maintained 
by the sponsor.  The SAP may modi fy the plans outlined in the p rotocol; however, any 
major modifications of the pr imary endpoint definition and/or i ts analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment.
14.1 OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of orally administered BBI608 plus 
weekly paclitaxel, in comparison to placebo plus weekly paclitax el on the Overall Survival in 
patients with pre-treated advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma.
Secondary objectives include comparisons of Overall Survival in the predefined biomarker-
positive population, Progression Free Survival, and Adverse Even ts be tween t he  two tre atm ent  
arms.
This study began as a multi-center, prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized 
phase III trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either B BI608 plus weekly paclitaxel, or 
placebo plus weekly paclitaxel in a 1:1 ratio and will be strati fied by geographical region (Asia 
versus North America, Europe, and Australia versus South America), time to progression on first 
line therapy (<6 months versusPRQWKVIURPVWDUWRIIL rst line therapy), disease measurability 
by RECIST 1.1 (measurable disease present vs not present), and prior taxane therapy (yes versus
no). 
At the time of this amendment, patients remaining on study trea tment will be unblinded and the 
study will continue as a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase III study of BBI608 plus 
weekly paclitaxel vs. weekly paclitaxel for adult patients with  advanced, pre-treated gastric or
GEJ adenocarcinoma. 
14.2 STUDY ENDPOINTS AND ANALYSIS
Primary Endpoint: 
Overall Survival in the General Study Population 
Overall Survival in the general study population, the primary end point of this study, is defined as 
the time from randomization to death from any cause. Patients w ho are alive at the time of the 
final analysis or who have becom e lost to follow-up will be cen sored at their last date known to 
be alive. Patients will be analyzed in the arm to which they ar e randomized regardless of the 
treatment they received (intent-to-treat analysis). The surviva l experience of patients in both 
treatment groups will be summarized by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared primarily by a 
stratified log-rank test adjusting for stratification variables at randomization.  
Sensitivity analyses based on stratified Cox proportional hazard s model will also be performed.
These sensitivity analyses are not included in the hierarchical  testing for secondary outcomes 
detailed below and, as such, do not control for type I error. Ge ographical region (Asia versus

therapy (<6 months versusPRQWKVIURPVWDUWRIIL rst line therapy), disease measurability by 
RECIST 1.1 (measurable disease present vsnot present), and prior taxane therapy (yes versus no)
will be the stratification factors to define the stratified Cox  proportional hazards model. Besides 
the treatment factor (BBI608+paclitaxel versus  placebo+paclitaxel), the following factors at 
patient entry will be included in the stratified Cox proportion al hazards model: 
xNumber of previous chemotherapy drug classes [platinum, fluropy rimidine, taxane,
anthracyclines], including during adjuvant or neoadjuvant thera py (< 3 versus  > 3)
xAge (< 65 versus  > 65)
xSex (male versus female)
xPrior trastuzumab-containing therapy (yes versus no)
xLocation of primary tumor (gastric versus GEJ) 
xPrior radiotherapy (yes versus  no) 
xPresence of peritoneal metastases (yes versus  no) 
xHistologic type (diffuse, intestinal, mixed, other) 
xReceived post protocol anticancer treatment [i.e. 3rdline regimen] (yes versus no)
xNumber of organ sites involved at baseline versus  <2) 
xPresence of primary tumor (present versus  absent) 
A subset analysis for the primary endpoint (OS) as sensitivity analyses will be conducted to 
address the benefit of BBI608 between the groups defined by the  above factors and the following: 
xGeographical region (Asia vs North America, Europe, and Australia vsSouth America)
xTime to progression on first line therapy (<6 months versusPRQWKVIURPVWDUWRIILUVWOLQH
therapy) 
xDisease measurability by RECIST 1.1 (measurable disease present  vsnot present)
xPrior taxane therapy (yes versus no) 
xRace (white, black, Asian, other)
Again, these sensitivity analyses are not included in the hiera rchical testing for secondary 
outcomes detailed below and, as such, do not control for type I  error. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The following secondary outcomes will be inferentially assessed  u s i n g  a  h i e r a r c h i c a l  a n a l y s i s  
method (eg, inferential analysis will stop and not continue to subsequent secondary outcomes 
after obtaining a probability greater than 0.05). The order of endpoint presentation below reflects 
the hierarchy of inferential testing. Inferential assessment of  secondary outcomes will take place 
only if the primary outcome (OS) is found to differ significant ly between treatments when 
analyzed via the primary analysis method detailed above.

population, using similar methodology. 
Progression-Free Survival in t he General Study Population 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the general study population is defined as the time from 
randomization to the first objective documentation of disease p rogression or death due to any 
cause. If a patient has not progressed or died at the time of f inal analysis, PFS will be censored on 
the date of the last tumor assessment. This includes patients w ho are lost to follow-up or have 
withdrawn consent. All  analyses for OS in the general study popu lation will also be performed for 
PFS in the general study population, using similar methodology.  
Progression-Free Survival in the Predefined Biomarker-positive P opulation 
PFS in the biomarker- SRVLWLYHSRSXODWLRQ>WKRVHSDWLHQWVZLWKQXFOHDUȕ -catenin positivity on 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Formalin Fixed Paraffin E mbedded (FFPE) archival 
tissue] is defined as the time from randomization to the first o bjective documentation of disease 
progression or death due to any cause. All analyses for OS in th e general study population will 
also be performed for PFS in the biomarker-positive population,  using similar methodology. 
Objective Response Rate in the General Study Population 
Objective Response (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patien ts with a documented complete 
response or partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1. The primary estimate of ORR will 
be based on patients with measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at r andomization.  
Disease Control Rate in the General Study Population 
Disease Control Rate (DCR) is de fined as the proportion of pati ents with a documented complete 
response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) b ased on RECIST 1.1. The 
primary estimate of DCR will be based on patients with measurab le disease by RECIST 1.1 at 
randomization.  
Safety Analysis
All patients who have received at least one dose of study treat ment (either BBI608/Placebo or 
paclitaxel) will be included in the safety analysis. The incide nce of adverse events will be 
summarized by type of adverse event and severity using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events Version 4.0. A Fisher’s exact test will be u sed to compare adverse events 
between the two arms if required.
14.3 SAMPLE SIZE AND DURATION OF STUDY
The primary study endpoint is Overall Survival (OS).  The study  is designed to have a power of 
90% and a two-sided alpha of 5% to detect a 24% reduction in the  continuous risk of death (HR 
0.76, which corresponds to an increase of median survival from 7 .36 to 9.67 months) in the 
Intention to Treat (ITT) general study population.  It is estim ated that 566 events will be required 
to detect this reduction which would be observed by randomizing  700 patients over 24 months 
and following them for an additi onal 12 months (including up to  5% of yearly dropouts).   
Assuming that 40% of deaths occur in patients who are biomarker -positive, the study will have 
90% power to detect a 31% reduction in the risk of death (HR 0. 69) at two-sided 0.05 alpha level 
in the secondary analysis of the biomarker-positive population.    
When the required number of events for the primary endpoint has  been reached, all randomized 
patients still alive will have continued study follow up throug h to their deaths.

CONFIDENTIAL 59 CONFIDENTIAL14.4 SAFETY MONITORING
Adverse events will be monitored on an on-going basis by centra l review. 
14.5 INTERIM AND FINAL ANALYSES 
There will be one interim analysis in this study to be presente d to the independent Data Safety 
and Monitoring Board (DSMB). Additionally, DSMB will review saf ety during conduct of the 
study. The role and responsibility of the DSMB will be defined in a separate Charter.
The interim analysis will be performed on OS, the primary endpo int of this study, when at least 
2/3rdof the required number of events (380) have been observed. This  a n a l y s i s ,  b a s e d  o n  t h e  
stratified log-rank test adjusting for the stratification varia bles at randomization, will test the 
following:

versus
H1: survival on BBI608+paclitaxel > survival on placebo + paclita xel 
The comparison of the overall population will be tested based o n a generalization of the Lan-
DeMets error spending function approach using an O’Brien-Flemin g stopping boundary to reject 
H0, controlling for a two-sided alpha of 5% at the end of the stu dy. For example, if exactly 380 
deaths (67% of the required events) were in the locked database  for the interim analysis, the 
nominal critical point for rejecting H 0would be 2.502corresponding to a p-value of 0.012.  Thus 
H0would be rejected, and superiority of BBI608 declared, early if  the p-value from stratified log-
rank test is  0.012. 
This trial was activated on October 2, 2014 and a total of 714 p atients were randomized. The 
714th patient was randomized on December 13, 2016. The cleaning  o f  t h e  d a t a  w h i c h  a r e  
required for the first interim analysis were completed on May 19 , 2017 with the cut off for safety 
portion of analysis being April 15 2017 and the cut off for the efficacy portion of the analysis
being December 20 2016.  Safety data and primary analysis based on the first 380 events were 
presented to DSMB on June 14, 2017. Additionally, the DSMB were presented with uncleaned 
and unlocked efficacy data for additional 142 deaths occurring b y the cut-off date of May 25 
2017. After reviewing the results on June 21 2017, the DSMB recomme nded unblinding of 
patients remaining on study treatment to allow patients to make  an informed decision regarding 
continuing or discontinuing study treatment. On June 24th, 2017 notification was sent to sites,
and investigators were instructed to inform patients of the first interim analysis findings and of 
their treatment arm allocation. All patients were directed to d ecide together with their investigator
if continuing study therapy is in their best interest. Given th at no safety concerns were identified 
by the DSMB, in cases in which a patient appears to be deriving  benefit from BBI608 and is 
tolerating treatment well, open-label continuation of study tre atment was permitted with patient 
consent.  
Due to study unblinding the analysis plan is amended as follows:  analysis will be conducted for 
primary endpoint of OS as outlined in Section 13.3. Patients wil l continue to receive treatment, if 
felt to be potentially beneficial by their Investigator, until a discontinuation criterion is met or 
until September 15 2017, whichever occurs first. Additionally, all secondary and exploratory 
analyses will be performed as outlined in the protocol.

CONFIDENTIAL 60 CONFIDENTIAL14.6 CORRELATIVE STUDIES
The correlative science component of the BBI608-336 trial will include tumor and blood based 
assays to identify biomarkers of benefit from BBI608 therapy, a s well as biomarkers of BBI608 
resistance. The purpose of these studies is to explore the rela tionship between biomarkers and 
disease response. The research aims to validate molecular marker s such as genes (DNA) and gene 
products (mRNA or proteins), with measurements of their sequenc e, post translation 
modifications or degree of expression, that can guide the use of appropriate therapeutic treatment 
regimens. The ultimate goal of identifying molecular markers is  to improve subject responses and 
other measures of clinical benefit by matching an individual su bject’s tumor diagnostic profile 
with an anticancer agent that has demonstrated a therapeutic ad vantage in subjects with a similar 
diagnostic profile.
Using data from this and other trials, the relationship between  a number of molecular markers 
associated with the STAT3 ȕ-catenin and other related pathways, and the clinical outcomes w ith 
BBI608 therapy will be explored. Multiple molecular markers in a paraffin-embedded tumor 
tissue sample can be determined by analyzing RNA and protein in  the tissue sample. 
In addition to analysis of potential biomarkers of benefit from  BBI608 therapy, an analysis of 
markers of resistance to BBI608 will be conducted using blood s amples drawn at baseline as well 
at 4 weeks post initiation of therapy. This analysis may involv e SNPs, CYPS, and metabolomics. 
Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, or cores (two 2 mm cores of t umor from the block) and 10-
30 unstained slides obtained from paraffin embedded specimens wi ll be required. Where it is not 
possible to obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block, 10-3 0 unstained slides of 
representative tumor tissue are also acceptable.  Patients who do not have available archival tissue 
may enroll on the study with permission of the Sponsor/CRO. 
Blood samples will be collected prior to dosing with BBI608 and  then at week 4 while on
BBI608/Placebo. 
The following analysis will be performed to investigate the rel ationship between endpoints and 
biomarker levels (e.g. STAT3, phospho-STAT3, E-catenin, etc): 
For each biomarker, Cox Proportional Hazards model will be used  to model the relationship 
between Overall Survival, Progression-Free Survival and duratio n of response with baseline value 
of the biomarker. The model will also include assigned treatmen t, interaction between treatment 
and biomarker, and will be stratified by baseline ECOG performa nce status.
For biomarkers with post-baseline measurements, similar analysi s will be done with change from 
baseline of a biomarker as a covariate, for both time points. A n additional model that includes 
prognostic factors may be investigated. 
The relationship between the endpoint and binary biomarkers (e. g. baseline phospho-STAT3 
status,E-catenin, etc) will be also examined using the log-rank test, s tratified by treatment and 
baseline ECOG performance status. Subgroup analysis by the stat us of the binary biomarker may 
also be performed. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to desc ribe overall survival, 
progression-free survival and duration of response by the statu s of the biomarker (e.g. phospho-
STAT3-high vs. phospho-STAT3-lo w) and by treatment group.

baseline values of biomarkers as well as with their change from  baseline and at week 4 time point 
will be investigated using logistic regression that includes as signed treatment and biomarker 
value and treatment-by-biomarker interaction, stratified by bas eline ECOG performance status. 
An additional model that includes prognostic factors may be inv estigated. The relationship 
between response and binary biomarkers (e.g. baseline phospho-S TAT3 status or STAT3 status) 
will also be examined using the CMH test, stratified by treatme n t  a n d  b a s e l i n e  E C O G

approaches and analyses of other biomarkers are expected and ma y be performed. All analyses 
described in this section are based on availability of data.

Sparse Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Exploratory analyses will be performed on the bioanalytic data obtained from sparse plasma 
sampling in order to characterize the population pharmacokineti cs of BBI608. Demographic and 
pathophysiologic factors that affect plasma concentration of BB I608 and paclitaxel in this 
population of patients with pre-treated advanced gastric/GEJ ad enocarcinoma will be examined. 
The exposure-response relationship between clinical and safety endpoints and BBI608/paclitaxel
exposure will also be examined.
Quality of Life Analysis
The Quality of Life (QoL) of patients will be assessed using EO RTC QLQ-30 while the patient 
remains on BBI608/Placebo as per Section 9.1. The EORTC QLQ-30 i s  a  s e l f - a d m i n i s t e r e d  
cancer specific questionnaire with multi-dimensional scales. It  consists of both multi-item scales 
and single item measures, including five functional domains, a global quality of life domain, three 
symptom domains, and six single items. Scoring of the EORTC QLQ -30 data will be completed 
following the procedures recommended by the EORTC Study Group o n Quality of Life. For each 
domain or single item measure a linear transformation will be a pplied to standardize the raw 
score to range between 0 and 100. The quality of life data will  be analyzed to look for statistically

at time 2 (~8 weeks) and time 4 (~16 weeks) for the physical fu nction and global health 
status/quality of life subscale scores. Wilcoxon tests will be used to compare the difference at 
each of these two time points between two treatment arms for eac h of these two subscales. The 
Hochberg method [Hochberg 1988] will be used to adjust for four comparisons in the primary 
analyses. The proportion of patients in either arm with at leas t a minimum of 10 unit(s) 
deterioration in change scores at both 8 and 16 weeks will be c ompared by means of Fisher’s 
exact test.

CONFIDENTIAL 64 CONFIDENTIAL16ETHICAL, REGULATORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES
16.1 REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
All institutions must conduct this trial in accordance with Int ernational Conference on 
Harmonization-Good Clinical Pract ice (ICH-GCP) Guidelines.
The conduct of this trial must comply with local laws and natio nal regulations [e.g. in the United 
States of America with applicable US FDA Regulations; in Canada  w i t h  D i v i s i o n  5  o f  t h e  
Canadian Regulations Respecting Food and Drugs (Food and Drugs Act)] relevant to the use of 
new therapeutic agents in the country of conduct. 
16.2 INCLUSIVITY IN RESEARCH
Individuals must not be excluded from participation in clinical trials on the basis of attributes 
such as culture, religion, race, national or ethnic origin, col our, mental or physical disability 
(except incapacity), sexual orientation, sex/gender, occupation , ethnicity, income, or criminal 
record, unless there is a valid reason (i.e. safety) for the ex clusion.  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Tri-Coun cil Policy Statement (TCPS), 
vulnerable persons or groups will not be automatically excluded  from a clinical trial (except for 
incompetent persons) if participation in the trial may benefit the patient or a group to which the 
person belongs.  
However, extra protections may be necessary for vulnerable pers ons or groups. It is the 
responsibility of the local investigator and Institutional Revi e w  B o a r d  ( I R B )  t o  e n s u r e  t h a t  
appropriate mechanisms are in place to protect vulnerable perso ns/groups. In accordance with 
TCPS, researchers and IRB should provide special protections for  those who are vulnerable to 
abuse, exploitation or discrimination. As vulnerable population s may be susceptible to coercion 
or undue influence, it is especially important that informed co nsent be obtained appropriately.  
Centers are expected to ensure compliance with local IRB or inst itutional policy regarding 
participation of vulnerable persons/groups. It is the center’s responsibility to ensure compliance 
with all local SOPs. 
Persons who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompe tent persons, or those 
physically incapacitated such as comatose persons) are not to b e recruited to this study. It is the 
responsibility of the local investigator to determine the subje ct’s competency, in accordance with 
applicable local policies and in conjunction with the local IRB  (if applicable).  
Subjects who were competent at the time of enrollment in the cl inical trial but become 
incompetent during their participation do not automatically hav e to be removed from the study. 
When re-consent of the patient is required, investigators must follow applicable local policies 
when determining if it is acceptable for a substitute decision maker to be used. The Sponsor will 
accept re-consent from a substitute decision maker. If this pat ient subsequently regains capacity, 
the patient should be re-consented as a condition of continuing  participation.

Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-14
  
CONFIDENTIAL 65 CONFIDENTIAL16.3 OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT
Informed consent will be obtained for each participant/potentia l participant in this trial, in 
accordance with ICH-GCP section 4.8. The center is responsible f or ensuring that all local 
policies are followed.
Additionally, in accordance with GCP 4.8.2, the Sponsor may requ ire that participants/potential 
participants be informed of any new information may impact a pa rticipant’s/potential 
participant’s willingness to participate in the study at which t ime participants remaining on study 
treatment will be re-consented.  
Based upon applicable guidelines and regulations (Declaration o f Helsinki, ICH-GCP), a 
participating investigator (as defined on the participants list ) is ultimately responsible, in terms of 
liability and compliance, for ensuring informed consent has bee n appropriately obtained. The 
Sponsor recognizes that in many centers other personnel (as des ignated on the participants list) 
also play an important role in this process. In accordance with  GCP 4.8.5, it is acceptable for the 
Principal Investigator to delegate the responsibility for condu cting the consent discussion.
The Sponsor requires that each participant sign a consent form p rior to their enrolment in the 
study to document his/her willingness to take part. The Sponsor may also require, as indicated 
above, that participants/potential participants be informed of new information if it becomes 
available during the course of the study and participants remain ing on study treatment will be re-
consented. In conjunction with GCP 4.8.2, the communication of this information should be 
documented. 
The Sponsor allows the use of translators in obtaining informed consent. Provision of translators 
is the responsibility of the local center. Centers should follow  applicable local policies when 
procuring or using a translator for the purpose of obtaining in formed consent to participate in a 
clinical trial. 
In accordance with ICH-GCP 4.8.9, if a subject is unable to rea d, then informed consent may be 
obtained by having the consent form read and explained to the s ubject. This process must be 
thoroughly documented. 
16.3.1 Obtaining Consent for Pregnancy/Exposure Reporting 
Information from and/or about the subject (i.e. the pregnant fe male, the newborn infant, male 
partner) should not be collected about or from them unless or u ntil they are a willing participant 
in the research. The rights and protections offered to particip ants in research apply and consent 
must be obtained prior to collect ing any information about or f rom them. If the pregnant female is 
not a participant in the main trial, consent should be obtained  via use of the exposure/ pregnancy 
follow-up consent form.  
In the case of information collected about a new born, consent should be provided by the legal 
guardian. In cases where the legal guardian is the participant in the main trial, consent is 
obtained via the main consent. If the legal guardian is not the trial participant, consent should be 
obtained via the exposure/pregnancy follow-up consent. 
Participants will not be withdrawn from the main trial as a res ult of refusing or withdrawing 
permission to provide information related to the pregnancy /exposure . Similarly, male participants

CONFIDENTIAL 67 CONFIDENTIAL16.4 DISCONTINUATION OF THE TRIAL
The trial is scheduled to discontinue on September 15 2017, at which time the Sponsor will cease 
provision of study treatment. If this trial is discontinued pri or to September 15 2017 for any 
reason by the Sponsor, all centers will be notified in writing of the discontinuance and the 
reason(s) why. If the reason(s) for discontinuance involve any potential risks to the health of 
patients participating on the trial or other persons, the Spons or will provide this information to 
centers as well.
If this trial is discontinued at any time by the center (prior t o closure of the trial by the Sponsor), 
it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to notif y the Sponsor of the discontinuation 
and the reason(s) why.  
Whether the trial is discontinued by the Sponsor or locally by the center, it is the responsibility of 
the Principal Investigator to notify the local Institutional Re view Board and all clinical trials 
subjects of the discontinuance and any potential risks to the s ubjects or other persons.
16.5 RETENTION OF PATIENT RECORDS AND STUDY FILES
All essential documents must be m aintained in accordance with I CH-GCP. 
The Principal Investigator must ensure compliance with GCP Guid eline from every person 
involved in the conduct of the clinical trial at the site.  
Essential documents must be retained for 25 years following the  completion of the trial at the 
center (25 years post final analysis, last data collected, or cl osure notification to IRB, whichever 
is later), or until notified by the Sponsor that documents no l onger need to be retained.  
In accordance with GCP 4.9.7, upon request by the monitor, audi tor, IRB or regulatory authority, 
the investigator/institution must make all required trial-relat ed records available for direct access. 
The Sponsor will inform the Investigator/Institution as to when  the essential documents no longer 
need to be retained. 
16.6 ON-SITE MONITORING/AUDITING
In addition to the routine review of case report forms and supp orting documents sent to the 
central office, site monitoring will be conducted at participat ing centers in the course of the study 
as part of the overall quality assurance programme. The monitor s/auditors will require access to 
patient medical records to verify the data, as well as pharmacy , essential document binders, 
standard operating procedures (including electronic information ) and ethics documentation. 
At any time, your site may be subject to an inspection by a reg ulatory agency such as the Health 
Canada Inspectorate or the FDA. Your site may also be subject t o an audit by the Sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL 78 CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX IV - QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT
Introduction 
The assumption that control of symptoms will automatically impr ove quality of life is probably true but 
hasn't yet been tested, especially in determining how certain s ymptoms may or may not affect quality of 
life. Current literature reveals interesting things; two in par ticular are:
xadditional and useful information may be obtained from quality of life measurements 
xa growing consensus that the goal of medical care today for mos t patients is the preservation of 
function and well-being in everyday life.
We have reached the stage where the collection of information a bout psychological distress, social 
disruption, emotional trauma and painful side-effects is not on ly necessary but a routine component in 
many protocols. 
Quality of life data can be used in a variety of ways:
xto try to achieve the best possible outcome for patients
xto evaluate the extent of change in the quality of life of an i ndividual or group across time
xto evaluate new treatments and technologies
xto support approval of new drug applications 
xto try to provide the best value for health care dollars 
xto compare costs and benefits of various financial and organiza tional aspects of health care services
In the future, approval of not only drugs but also new therapie s or methods of delivery will most likely be 
based on a combination of quality of life, survival, response, and adverse event data. 
Instructions for Administration of a Quality of Life Questionna ire. The instructions below are intended as 
a guide for the administration of the Quality of Life questionn aire. 
1. Preamble
Quality of life data are collected for research purposes, and w ill usually not be used for the patient’s 
individual medical care. The assessment is in the form of a sel f-report questionnaire. Therefore, it 
must be completed by the patien t only, without translation, coa ching or suggestions as to the "correct" 
answer by relatives or health care personnel.
The usual scheduled times to obtain the questionnaires are as f ollows: 
xpre-randomization or pre-registration (baseline)
xduring treatment 
xduring follow-up 
The information provided by the patient in the completed questi onnaire is confidential and should not 
be discussed with or shown to anyone who is NOT mentioned in th e consent form signed by the 
patient.
BBI608-336
Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-14
  
CONFIDENTIAL 79 CONFIDENTIALIf a particular question has not been answered, please document  the reason(s) in the appropriate space 
on the questionnaire. If the whole questionnaire has not been c ompleted, please document the 
reason(s) on the appropriate case report forms.
2. Pretreatment Assessment
It should be explained to the patient that the purpose of the q uestionnaire is to assess the impact of 
treatment on different areas of the patient's life, e.g.: psych ological distress, social disruption, side-
effects, et cetera.
Study staff should collect the questionnaire as soon as it has b een completed, check to see that each 
question has been answered and gently remind the patient to ans wer any inadvertently omitted 
questions. If a patient states that s/he prefers not to answer some questions and gives a reason(s), the 
reason(s) should be noted on the questionnaire. If a specific r eason is not given, this also should be 
noted on the questionnaire. 
3. Assessments During Treatment
The quality of life questionnaire should be given to the patien t before being seen by the doctor, and 
prior to treatment on the day of treatment, as required by the schedule in the protocol. If the patient 
does not have a doctor visit scheduled, or if it was not possib le for the patient to complete the 
questionnaire before being seen by the doctor, s/he should stil l complete the questionnaire prior to 
treatment.
4. Assessments During Follow-up 
The quality of life questionnaire should be given to the patien t before being seen by the doctor, for as 
long as the patient continues on Protocol therapy, as required by the schedule at approximately: 
•4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weeks or until deterioration to ECOG PS 4 o r hospitalization for end of life 
care
•the first regularly scheduled 4 week assessment at which the pa tient has been off study therapy 
for a minimum of 28 days (+/- 3 days) if study therapy discontinuation occurred prior to 24 
weeks and until deterioration to ECOG PS 4 or hospitalization f or end of life care  
A patient may, on occasion, be reluctant to complete the questi onnaire because they feel unwell. In 
that case, you may express sympathy that things are below par, but state that this is exactly the 
information we require if we are to understand more about how q uality of life is affected. You may 
also remind them that it takes only a few minutes to complete.
It defeats the whole purpose of the assessment if it is delayed  until the patient feels better!
5. What If . . .
The patient should complete the questionnaires at the clinic. T he exception is that the design of 
some trials may require the patient to take the questionnaire h ome with them after leaving the 
clinic, and complete it on the specific day, because a return v isit to the clinic is not scheduled.
There may be circumstances when the patient does not complete th e questionnaire as required in 
the clinic. Three situations are described below. In these case s, it is beneficial if quality of life 
data can still be collected.
BBI608-336
Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-14
  
CONFIDENTIAL 80 CONFIDENTIALA. The patient leaves the clinic before the questionnaire could be administered, or someone 
forgets to give the questionnaire to the patient.  
Contact the patient by phone informing him or her that the ques tionnaire was not completed. 
Ask the patient if s/he is willing to complete one:
If yes, mail a blank questionnaire to the patient, and make arr angements for return of the 
questionnaire in a timely fashion. Record the date it was maile d and the date received on the 
questionnaire. 
If this is not feasible, then ask the patient if s/he is willing  to complete a questionnaire over 
the phone. If the patient agrees, read out the questions and ra nge of possibilities, and record 
the answers. Make a note on the questionnaire that the question naire was completed over the 
phone. 
If no, note the reason why the questionnaire was not completed o n the appropriate case report 
form.
B. The patient goes on an extended vacation for several months a nd won't attend the clinic for 
regular visit(s).
Ensure that the patient has a supply of questionnaires, with in structions about when to 
complete them, and how to return them. If it is known beforehan d, give the patient blank 
questionnaires at the last clinic visit; if the extended absenc e is not known in advance, mail 
the blank questionnaires to the patient. Written instructions m ay help ensure that the patient 
stays on schedule as much as possible. 
C. The patient does not want to complete the questionnaire in cl inic. 
Should the patient not wish to answer the questionnaire in the clinic but insists on taking it 
home, and failing to comply with the patient's wishes is likely  to result in the questionnaire 
not being completed at all, then the patient may take the quest ionnaire home with instructions 
that it is to be completed the same day. When the questionnaire  is returned, the date on which 
the questionnaire was completed should be noted and a comment m ade on the questionnaire 
as to why the patient took it away  from the clinic before compl etion.

CONFIDENTIAL 76 CO NFIDENTIALAPPENDIX V - UNBLINDING
All patients remaining on study treatment at the time of this a mendment must be unblinded. The process 
for unbinding is outlined in Appendix VI. 
Patients who discontinued study treatment prior to the time of this amendment must remain blinded. 
However, in the event of a medical emergency in an individual s ubject, in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is critical to the subject's or subject ’s partner urgent management, the blind for 
that subject may be broken by the treating physician. Before br eaking the blind of an individual subject's 
blinded treatment (for the subjects who discontinued study trea tment prior to the time of this amendment), 
the Investigator should have determined that the information is  necessary, i.e. that it will alter the subject's 
or subject’s partner immediate management. In many cases, parti cularly when the emergency is clearly 
not investigational product related, the problem may be properl y managed by assuming that the subject 
was receiving active product without the need for unblinding.  
For any treatment code unblinding, including patients who on st udy treatment at the time of this 
amendment as well as those who discontinued study treatment prio r to this amendment, the reason and 
parties involved must be documented in the patient’s medical re cord. Treatment identification information 
for patients who discontinued study treatment prior this amendm ent should be kept confidential. Further, 
for the patients who discontinued study treatment prior to this  amendment, the Sponsor/CRO must be 
made aware of the break of the blind prior to the event taking p lace except in cases where an immediate 
need for unblinding exists for reasons of patient safety at whic h time the investigator can unblind the 
patient prior to notifying the Sponsor. However, the investigato r will have the final decision and unilateral 
right for unblinding in matters i nvolving the safety of study su bjects.

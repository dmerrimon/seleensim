There are 78 participants and 88 exams in the liver disease group. Within this group, 11 exams are
unusable due to using the linear probe; 5 exams are unusable because they were screen fails. A
total of 10 patients had two exams – of which 5 exams were repeated since they were initially done
with the linear probe and they returned for another curved exam; another 5 were repeated because
they had a second biopsy performed. A total of 72 exams in the liver group have usable data.
There are 93 control patients and 95 control exams. Within the control group, 12 exams were
unable to be used due to using the linear probe; 2 are unusable since they were screen fails. A
total of 2 patients had a repeat exam since they came back after initially having an exam with a
linear probe. A total of 79 exams in the control group have usable data.
Screen fails include those from patients who moved too much, who were too obese to obtain an
image, or in whom the liver biopsy was not performed.

1. Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met.
 
a)  Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 31, 32) is not
required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases the
acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)
 
        
     b) Research on medical devices for which
(i)  An investigational device exemption application (21 CFR Part 812) is not required; or
       
              
     (ii)  The medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in
accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.
 
2. Collection of blood samples by finger stick, heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows:
 
a)  From healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the amounts
drawn may not exceed 550 ml in an 8-week period and collection may not occur more frequently
than 2 times per week; or
 
     
     
          From other adults and children, considering the age, weight, and health of the subjects, the
collection procedure, the amount of blood to be collected, and the frequency with which it will be
collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per
kg in an 8-week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week.
     Children are "persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or
procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which
the research will be conducted."
 
3. Prospective collection of biological specimens for research purposes by non-invasive means.
 
  
  
  EXAMPLES: (a) hair and nail clippings in a nondisfiguring manner; (b) deciduous teeth at time of exfoliation or
if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction; (c) permanent teeth if routine patient care indicates a
need for extraction; (d) excreta and external secretions (including sweat); (e) uncannulated saliva collected
either in an unstimulated fashion or stimulated by chewing gumbase or wax or by applying a dilute citric
solution to the tongue; (f) placenta removed at delivery; (g) amniotic fluid obtained at the time of rupture of the
membrane prior to or during labor; (h) supra-and subgingival dental plaque and calculus, provided the
collection procedure is not more invasive than routine prophylactic scaling of the teeth and the process is
accomplished in accordance with accepted prophylactic techniques; (i) mucosal and skin cells collected by
buccal scraping or swab, skin swab, or mouth washings; (j) sputum collected after saline mist nebulization.
 
4. Collection of data through non-invasive procedures (not involving general anesthesia or sedation)
routinely employed in clinical practice, excluding procedures involving X-rays or microwaves. Where
medical devices are employed, they must be cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally eligible for expedited

  EXAMPLES: (a) physical sensors that are applied either to the surface of the body or at a distance and do not
involve input of significant amounts of energy into the subject or an invasion of the subjects' privacy; (b)
weighing or testing sensory acuity; (c) magnetic resonance imaging; (d) electrocardiography,
electroencephalography, thermography, detection of naturally occurring radioactivity, electroretinography,
ultrasound, diagnostic infrared imaging, doppler blood flow, and echocardiology; (e) moderate exercise,
muscular strength testing, body composition assessment, and flexibility testing where appropriate given the
age, weight and health of the individual.
 
5. Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been collected, or
will be collected solely for nonresearch purposes (such as medical treatment or diagnosis). (NOTE:
Some research in this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of human
subjects. 45CFR 46.101(b)(4). This listing refers only to research that is not exempt.)
 
6. Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.
 
7. Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior (including, but not limited to, research on
perception, cognition, motivation, identity, language, communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and
social behavior) or research employing survey, interview, oral history, focus group, program
evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies. (NOTE: Some research in
this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects. 45 CFR

The evaluation of pediatric liver disease continues to be a major focus of research both in well-
characterized liver diseases and in liver fibrosis secondary to obesity.  The degree of fibrosis is
generally well-accepted as both a measurement of disease severity and a prognostic indicator.
Unfortunately, the current gold standard to assess fibrosis remains a liver biopsy, which, in
addition to anesthesia risks and sampling errors, can result in profound hemorrhage, infections,
and even mortality. Standard and reliable noninvasive biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis in the
pediatric population are greatly needed.  Sonoelastography has emerged as a method of
evaluating liver disease.  Three methods of quantitative sonoelastography are currently in use.
Transient elastography is an M-mode based sonographic technique in which a mechanical
vibrator creates a low-frequency wave causing shear stress in the tissue at a fixed depth in the
target tissue.  It has gained widespread use in evaluation of liver fibrosis in the adult population
(Fibroscan); however, its use has great limitations in the pediatric population as it does not use
real-time ultrasonography (B mode) and has a fixed depth in which the measurement is taken.
The lack of real-time imaging makes it impossible to accurately select an area for appropriate
sampling, and the fixed depth is not appropriate for very young children with smaller livers.
Also, the shock wave that is administered has not been tailored for use in young children.
Furthermore, this technique is very unreliable in patients that are obese or who have ascites.
Other methods of sonoelastography include Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging (ARFI)
and Shear Wave Elastography (SWE).  The latter is also known as supersonic shear wave
imaging.  Both of these techniques use real-time ultrasonography and administer focused high-
intensity, short-duration (acoustic radiation) pulses to produce shear waves in the target tissue.
Neither technique is limited by the presence of ascites as the shear waves propagate through
the fluid.  ARFI uses a single pushing beam to generate the shear waves, and the propagation
of those shear waves are monitored using conventional pulse-echo ultrasound at various off-
axis lateral locations.  The speed of the shear wave in the tissue is determined by collecting the
displacement through time.  This principle of elastography is based on the Young modulus
using the formula: E=3ρѴ2 (E elasticity’s modulus, Ѵ speed, ρ density of the tissue).  The
degree of tissue displacement is then used to create an elastogram.  Limitations of ARFI
include a small selected region of interest (ROI) (10 mm x 5 mm), it is a 1-dimensional
technique, and it is unable to provide a corresponding elasticity map of the tissue.  The latter
also prevents retrospective evaluations of the tissue elasticity.
SWE is the newest elastography technique.  It works by generating a localized radiation force
that travels faster down the acoustic axis than the shear wave speed producing tiny, almost
simultaneous, displacements in the tissues at all positions along the acoustic axis.  The
generated shear wave is shaped like a cone or fan, known as the Mach cone.  An ultrafast

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sonography is then performed which provides a side-by-side greyscale image and color-coded
elasticity map of the tissue in the ROI.  The ROI is displayed in real time B-mode imaging and,
thus, represents a 2-dimensional technique.  Advantages include a larger, fan-shaped ROI (up
to 50mm x 50mm), and the acquisition of a quantitative map of liver tissue stiffness with
corresponding greyscale ultrasound image.  As a result, simultaneous viewing of the selected
region of interest provides better anatomic detail with a corresponding color map of the tissue
elasticity which may result in more accurate scoring of the stage of fibrosis.  The presence of a
color map also allows for retrospective analysis.
Only a few studies have begun to use ARFI to analyze liver fibrosis in the pediatric population.
Studies using SWE for evaluation of liver fibrosis are also limited and all but one have been
performed in adults; however, early studies have shown it to be an accurate method for liver
fibrosis staging.   Tutar, et al safely performed a study using SWE in pediatric patients in
Turkey.  No dedicated pediatric studies have been performed in the United States, as the
technology was just recently approved for use in adults by the FDA.  The use of this device in
pediatrics represents an off-label use.   That being said, SWE has safety considerations that
are similar to Doppler mode which is a standard ultrasound technology performed in pediatric
patients of all ages.   While it has a higher thermal index than routine B-mode ultrasound, it is
measured to be within the safety limits set by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine
(AIUM).

2. Purpose of the study
 
      a)   Provide a brief lay summary of the project in <200 words. The lay summary should be readily
understandable to the general public.
Background: Pediatric liver disease continues to remain a major focus of research. This has
taken on greater relevance with the rise in pediatric obesity which, in addition to several other
well-characterized liver diseases, causes liver fibrosis. The degree of fibrosis is well-accepted
as both a measurement of disease severity and a prognostic indicator.  Unfortunately, the
current gold standard to assess fibrosis remains a liver biopsy, which, in addition to anesthesia
risks and sampling errors, can result in profound hemorrhage, infections, and even mortality.
Thus, there is a great need for reliable, non-invasive biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis.
Sonoelastography has emerged as a method of evaluating liver disease.
Specific Aims: To perform shear wave elastography (SWE) on pediatric patients with known
liver disease who undergo a liver biopsy in order to determine the accuracy of SWE in
evaluating the various stages of liver fibrosis using the METAVIR histopathologic scale.  We will
also perform SWE on patients without liver disease to establish baseline measurements in a
normal liver.
Potential Impact: SWE may represent an accurate, reliable, and noninvasive method of staging
liver fibrosis in pediatric patients and may obviate the need for performing liver biopsies in
evaluating liver disease in these patients.

randomized.
The study design is a prospective single blind control experiment.  Subject recruitment will be
ongoing as patients who undergo routine liver biopsy in order to evaluate their liver disease will
also undergo an ultrasound with sonoelastography.  The minimum number of patients required
in the test group in order to determine accuracy of the research test is 100.  Study recruitment
for patients without liver disease will be stopped once 100 patients are enrolled.  An additional 8
months will be required for study analysis.

procedures that are part of standard of care. Specify which procedures are for research and
which are standard of care. Please note: The box below is for text only. If you would like to add
tables, charts, etc., attach those files in the Attachment section (#16).
Any pediatric patient (0-18 years of age) with known liver disease in whom a liver biopsy is to
be performed as standard of care to assess the degree of fibrosis will also undergo an
abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the liver.  The ultrasound is also standard of care.  Informed
consent will then be obtained from the patient's parent or guardian with verbal assent from the
patient for the perfomance of a shear wave sonoelastography exam as part of the research
study.   The research portion of the ultrasound exam will be performed at the same time as the
standard of care ultrasound exam.  The ultrasound must be performed within 1 month of the
liver biopsy.  No additional visits or treatments are required of the patients beyond what they
would normally have as part of their routine treatment or medical care following the liver biopsy.
Following the liver biopsy and ultrasound exam, the patients involvement in the study is
complete.  The patient's electronic medical record will be reviewed for pertinent clinical
information including history, laboratory values, and liver biopsy results.
Underlying diagnoses include but are not limited to biliary atresia, congenital fibrosis-
cholestasis, Alagille syndrome, Caroli’s disease, choledochal cyst, alpha-1-antitrypsin
deficiency, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), viral hepatitis, glycogenosis,
fructosemia, Wilson disease, cystic fibrosis, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
(ARPCKD), mesenterico-caval shunt, post liver transplant, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH).
In addition, any pediatric patient (0-18 years of age) undergoing evaluation with an abdominal
ultrasound as standard of care for evaluation for a diagnosis other than liver disease and in
whom the US shows a normal liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and biliary tree will then be
asked to enroll  in the research study by undergoing shear wave elastography.  Following
completion of the exam, the patient's involvement in the study will be complete.  No additional
follow up appointments or study visits are required.  Liver biopsies are not to be performed in
this group of patients.
The biopsy will be obtained as random sample, preferably from the right lobe of the liver, by the
pediatric gastroenterologists as this is the area that the sonoelastography measurements will
also be obtained.  This should reduce sampling error and result discordance.  The liver biopsy
must be obtained within 1 month of the ultrasound exam.
Histolopathologic evaluation will be performed using the Ishak and METAVIR classification
systems by pathologists blinded to elastography results.  These classifications systems are part
of the standard of care evaluation of the biopsy material.  Only the liver biopsy results in the
patient's chart will be reviewed as part of the study.
Ishak:
0: No fibrosis
1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa
2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa
3:  Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal (P-P) bridging
4:  Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging [portal to portal (P-P) as well as
portal to central (P-C)]
5:  Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)
6.  Cirrhosis, probably or definite
METAVIR:
F0: no portal fibrosis
F1: portal fibrosis without septa

Shear wave ultrasound—Using 2 probes (C1-6 which is a low frequency curved probe and L9
which is a high-frequency linear probe) on the the GE Logiq E9, the selected area of interest
(ROI) will be in the right lobe of the liver or in a portion of a transplant liver.  The ROI will be an
area away from vessels and bile ducts using an intercostal or subcostal approach.  Ten
separate acquisitions will be obtained on each patient by the attending radiologist and
sonographer who are blinded to the results of the liver biopsy.  The mean value will be used.
 
      c)   If the proposed study is a clinical trial where a drug, vaccine, device or other treatment is

example, it may be reasonable to stop enrollment on a study when efficacy has already been
clearly demonstrated, to avoid unnecessary enrollments of additional subjects. Alternatively, it
may be reasonable to stop enrollment when it is clear that efficacy will never be demonstrated,
given the statistical power of the study as designed. Describe the guidelines that are in place to
assist in making these determinations, if relevant to the proposed study.

analysis. If none, please justify.
The results of the SWE using the velocity measurements displayed on the elastography map
with a quantitative color map that is expressed in kPa (kiloPascals) will be correlated with the
stage of fibrosis using the METAVIR scale from the liver biopsy results in order to determine the
accuracy of SWE in evaluating the various degrees of liver fibrosis.  The statistical analysis will
include Receiver Operating Characteristic curves as well as scatter plots and box plots.  The
mean and median values as well as a range of the SWE measurements will be correlated with
the individual METAVIR stages of fibrosis (F0-F4), and a p value will be calculated for each
stage to assess the accuracy of SWE based on individual fibrosis stages.  Further statistical
analysis will also be performed to compare results of SWE and histopathology in subgroups of
liver disease patients, such as those with NASH compared to those without.  Scatter plots will
be used to compare the SWE results in normal patients to those with liver disease.

Guidelines for additional considerations and strategies for mitigating risks.
 
g) Describe how potential subjects will be identified for recruitment (e.g., chart review, referral from individual's
treating physician, those individuals answering an ad). How will potential participants learn about the
research, and how will they be recruited (e.g., flyer, e-mail, web posting, telephone, etc.)? Upload
recruitment materials in the Attachment Section (#16). Important to remember: potential subjects cannot be
contacted before IRB approval. NOTE: The use of SLU owned websites in an approved SLU format (e.g.,
Cancer Center website, etc.) are always approved methods of recruitment.
Potential subjects with known liver disease will be recruited by the pediatric gastroenterologists as these
patients would be undergoing ultrasound evaluation and liver biopsy as part of standard of care treatment.
These patients would be presented with a recruitment statement form during their clinic visit.  During their
exam in radiology, explanation of the procedure would be performed by the radiologist who would then
obtain consent from the parent and informed assent from the child.  Potential control patients will be
recruited by giving them a recruitment statement and copy of the consent form as they check-in to the
radiology department for an abdominal exam ordered by a physician as part of standard clinical care.  The
form will inform them that they may be asked to participate in the study following the exam.  If deemed
eligible by the radiologist, the radiologist will then obtain consent from the parent and informed assent from
the child.  Recruitment will also  occur  via  flyers  posted  in  the  radiology  department  and  GI  clinics.

h) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.
 
    Identify inclusion criteria.
Inclusion criteria:
Test population: Any pediatric patient (0-18 years of age) with known liver disease with plans to
undergo a liver biopsy within 1 month of ultrasound exam.  Underlying diagnoses include but are not
limited to biliary atresia, congenital fibrosis-cholestasis, Alagille syndrome, Caroli’s disease,
choledochal cyst, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC),
viral hepatitis, glycogenosis, fructosemia, Wilson disease, cystic fibrosis, autosomal recessive
polycystic kidney disease (ARPCKD), mesenterico-caval shunt, post liver transplant, and nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH).  Written informed consent from parent or legal guardian. Informed assent from
the child.
Control population: Any pediatric patient (0-18 years of age) undergoing an abdominal ultrasound for
reasons other than liver disease and in whom the US shows a normal liver, gallbladder, pancreas,
spleen, and biliary tree.  Written informed consent from parent or legal guardian. Informed assent from
the child.  In addition, the patients that have undergone biopsy and have shown no histologic evidence

of fibrosis will also serve as a control population.  The elastography measurements of these patients
will be compared to those obtained in the pediatric patients without a history of liver disease in whom
the ultrasound exam of the abdomen was found to be normal.
 
    Identify exclusion criteria.
Exclusion criteria: Inconclusive biopsy results. Patient not cooperative for the ultrasound exam. Failure
to give informed consent.  No biopsy results within allotted time frame.  Poor acoustic window in which
to perform sonoelastography.
 
i) Compensation. Explain the amount and schedule of compensation, if any, that will be paid for participation
in the study. Include provisions for prorating payment.
No compensation will be provided for participation in the study for the initial study group unless patients
were asked to come back in for an additional ultrasound because original data was unusable. In that case,
they will receive $50 for their visit if they live within 40 miles and $100 if they live
further out to cover the cost of the additional travel and additional time required to Cardinal Glennon for the
ultrasound exam visit required for participation.
 
j) Describe who will cover study related costs. Explain any costs that will be charged to the subject.
Study related costs will be covered by intramural and possible extramural funding.  The patient will not be
charged for any costs related to the shear wave elastography exam.  Costs of patient office visits, liver
biopsy, and routine ultrasound exams will be paid by the patient or insurance company as these are
considered standard of care treatment methods.
 
k) Estimate the probable duration of the entire study including data analysis and publication. This estimate
should include the total time each subject is to be involved and the duration the data about the subject is to
be collected. If the study is  Investigator-initiated, a timeline  for individual subject recruitment, follow-up,
total time for subject accrual, and data analysis for the study is required.
The total recruitment process for control patients is estimated to take one year.  The total recruitment
process for test subjects is expected to take 18 months.  The data analysis is expected to take 3 months.

participants.
There is no potential benefit to the subjects.  The results of the study may benefit future subjects and/or
society in general as if shear wave sonoelastography is found to be an accurate method of evaluating the
degree of liver fibrosis in pediatric patients, it may reduce or obviate the need for liver biopsies in patients
with liver disease.  In addition, if the number of required liver biopsies in these patients is reduced or
eliminated, the risks associated with performing sedation in these patients is also reduced or eliminated.
 
b) Alternatives. Describe any alternative treatments and procedures available to the subjects should they
choose not to participate in the study. If no such alternatives exist, please state that the alternative is
nonparticipation. For some studies, such as record reviews, a description of alternatives would not be
applicable.
Nonparticipation
 
11. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality and Privacy
        
Federal regulations require that research materials be kept for a minimum of three (3) years and HIPAA
documents be kept for a minimum of six (6) years after the closure of the study. For FDA-regulated or
sponsored projects, the PI may be required to keep the data and documents for a longer time period.
 
Confidentiality
 
         To determine whether adequate provisions for confidentiality of data are in place, the IRB must ensure that
research materials are stored in appropriate locations throughout the study (during collection,
transport/transmission, analysis and long term storage). Research information must be protected using
appropriate safeguards based on identifiability of the data and risk associated with the study (See SLU IRB
Confidentiality Guidelines).
     
For the questions below, please use the following definitions:
 Anonymous/De-identified: data contain no identifiers, including code numbers that investigators can link to
individual identities;
 Coded: data in which (1) identifying information, such as name or social security number, has been
replaced with a number, letter, symbol, or combination thereof (i.e., the code), and (2) a key to decipher the
code exists enabling linkage of data to identifying information (e.g., a master list), and (3) the key (master
list) is kept separately from coded data; AND/OR
 Identifiable: data that includes personal identifiers (e.g., name, social security number), such that
information could be readily connected to respective individuals.

Federal regulations require that informed consent be obtained from individuals prior to their participation in
research unless the IRB grants a waiver of consent. Answer the questions, below, then click Add to provide
the necessary consent documents and information regarding subject consent. Multiple consents/waivers
may be added, but they must be uploaded one at a time.
 
NOTE: You may refer to the SLU IRB Guidance for Obtaining Informed Consent for considerations
regarding the consent/assent process.
 
State N/A if not applicable.

     2) If the study involves adults unable to consent for themselves (whether diminished capacity to consent
is temporary, permanent, progressive or fluctuating), please address the following: a) how is capacity
to provide consent being assessed (initially and throughout study, if applicable); b) if unable to
provide consent, how is LAR being determined (See SLU LAR Guidelines); c) if unable to provide
consent, will assent be obtained and if not, why not?; d) if unable to provide assent, will dissent be
honored and if not, why not? Note: participants initially unable to provide consent for themselves are
expected to be given an opportunity to provide consent once capacity is gained. See SLU Guidelines
for Adults Unable to Provide Consent for additional detail.
In patients that are old enough for assent but are cognitively impaired to a point of being unable to
give assent we would allow the parents or guardians to make the decision about participation.  We
will make every effort to assent the patient to best of their ability.
Note: Any assent documents which will be used per the Adults Unable to Provide Consent guidance, should be
appropriately named and uploaded using the Add button and the Consent drop down menu selection.

Complete this section if your study includes minors. The Assent Form Template provides
guidelines for writing assent documents.
 
       1. Will minors be asked to give assent, then consent once they reach adulthood? If not, please justify. If
not capable to provide assent initially, please address whether assent will be obtained as the minor
gains capacity. Note: children who reach the age of adulthood during participation should be given
the opportunity to provide consent as parent/guardian consent no longer applies. If obtaining consent
would be impracticable (e.g., this is a registry with data/specimen obtained long ago), a waiver of
consent should be added for IRB review. See SLU Guidelines for Research Involving Minors for
additional detail.
Yes, unless they are developmentally delayed and are unable to give assent, then it will be left up to
the parent/guardian for the decision to participate, but we will still go over the assent with the patient
and make every effort to inform them to best of our ability.

       2. If minors are asked to assent and do not wish to participate, will they still be accrued in the study? If
yes, justify.
No
 
       3. How will the minor's ability to give assent be assessed? (Consider the age and maturity of the minors
as well as their physical or mental condition). If capacity is fluctuating, please explain how capacity
will be assessed throughout the study.
Research team members involved in consenting are pediatric health care providers with training in
childhood development. Comprehension and willingness will be based on the researchers
interaction with the adolescent. Parental input will be considered but will not supersede the
investigator’s analysis of the child’s willingness to participate.
 
  Note:  For studies that require a discussion about reproductive risks, note that the conversation with the
minor should take place separately from the parents. Also, if a minor will reach adulthood (18 in Missouri)
during the course of the study, they will need to be asked to consent as an adult at that time to continue in
the study.

TERN-101 is a non-steroidal, synthe tic small molecule  and is 
formulated for oral administra tion in capsule or tablet form. T ERN-101 is a potent FXR agonist. 
As a selective and potent nonstero idal, non-bile acid FXR agonist, TERN-101 may offer a 
unique safety and efficacy profile  to benefit the NASH patient population. As summarized

as a disease-modifying t reatment for NASH. 
2.2.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In mouse  NASH models, TERN-101 inhibited 7- DC4 and significantly reduced NAFLD 
activity score (NAS) and liver fib rosis area. NAS was markedly reduced by all doses of TERN-
101 tested ( Figure 1, left panel) with an 80% reduc tion from baseline at 100 mg/kg (mpk). 
Steatosis was reduced to healthy control (lean mice) levels at 30 mpk ( Figure 2 , left), and 
hepatocellular ballooning was red uced to healthy control levels  at 100 mpk ( Figure 2 , middle).  
Hepatic inflamma tion was also reduced in TERN-101 treated mice (Figure 2 , right). The 
improvement in liver histology c orrelated with a reduction in liver triglycerides, serum lipids and 
the liver-related enzymes ALT and AST. These results indicate p otent FXR agonist activity and 
support that TERN-101 has the potential for use in the treatmen t of NASH.

FGF-19 concentrations and dose-dependent decreases in 7- Į-C4 concentrations were observed 
after single doses of TERN-101 tab lets. Administration of TERN- 101 (5 mg) tablet with food 
delayed the time of maximal plasma concentrations (from ~1 hour  fasted to ~4 hours fed) but did 
not result in significant diffe rences in exposure as assessed b y AUC.  
 
 
 
 
Safety findings from the 4 clini cal studies showed that TERN-10 1 was well-tole rated overall. 
AEs were predominantly mild and t ransient. The predefined maxim um tolerated dose was not 
reached in any study. The overall AE incidence was generally ba lanced between dose groups. 
Following multiple doses of TERN-101 capsules of up to 400 mg, no TEAEs were attributable to 
TERN-101 on the basis of frequen cy, dose-relationship, or expec ted pharmacology. Pruritus was 
not reported by any of the 119 huma n subjects who have received  TERN-101 to date.

transaminase elevations > 1.5 t imes upper limit of normal were observed in the subsequent 
completed repeat dose study (TERN 101-US-A101) 
 or Study TERN101-US-A104). In the 2 completed repeat do se Phase 1 TERN-101 
studies, no consistent trends in c hanges from baseline in LDL c holesterol were observed with 
TERN-101. In the recently complete d Phase 1 study TERN101-US-A1 04, there was no 
consistent pattern of L DL change on-study; several subjects had  elevated levels prior to dosing, 
and LDL remained at overal l similar levels on-study.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 82   4. Study Design 
4.1. Overall Design 
This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, para llel-group study. 
Approximately 96 clinically or histologically diagnosed adult n on-cirrhotic presumed NASH 
patients who meet study eligibilit y criteria will  be enrolled a nd randomized at an overall ratio of 
1:1:1:1 into 4 groups receiving 5 mg (n = 24), 10 mg (n = 24), 15 mg (n = 24) TERN-101 tablet 
or matching placebo (n = 24) orally once daily.  
Of the 96 patients randomized, 24 pa tients will ta ke part in an  intensive PK and PD collection 
after the first dose and afte r the last dose of study drug. Thi s includes 6 patients at each 
TERN-101 dose level, and 6 patients in the placebo group. Patie nts who are not participating in 
the PK/PD sub-study will have  trough PK/PD sampling only.  
The total study duration will be a pproximately 24 weeks, consis ting of an 8-week Screening 
Period, a 12-week Treatment Per iod and a 4-week Follow-up Perio d.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
The study will enroll male and fem ale patients with non-cirrhotic presumed NASH in order to 
obtain evidence of safety, pre liminary efficacy, PK, and PD of 3 dose levels of TERN-101. The 
multiple-dose design of this study is randomized and double-blinded to minimize bias and to 
enable efficient evaluation of  different dose levels. The place bo control is included to facilitate 
identification of effects relate d to administration of TERN-101  rather than the study procedures, 
disease, or situation. The st udy duration will allow characteri zation of the safety and tolerability 
of TERN-101 with 12 weeks of dosing a s well as initial assessme nt of effect of TERN-101 on 
efficacy parameters  in a NASH population. 
4.3. Justification for Dose 
Based on PK results from TERN 101-US-A104 Phase 1 study in healt hy subjects, the tablet 
formulation of TERN-101 was dose linear in the range of 5 mg to  25 mg, with AUC 0-t of  
475 (±161) ng*hr/mL and 2890 (± 720) ng*hr/mL for 5 and 25 mg ta blets, respectively. 
 
 
Evidence of FXR target enga gement was seen for doses ranged from 5 mg to 
25 mg tablets of TERN-101 (see Section 2.2.3). The doses selected for this study of 5 mg, 
10 mg, and 15 mg TERN-101 tablets are  expected to achieve FXR target engagement and will 
allow for characterization of the  safety and efficacy of TERN-1 01 across these dose levels. 
There was no significant impact  of food intake on TERN-101 PK based on results from 
Study TERN101-US-A104, thus TERN- 101 can be dosed without regar d to food intake.

6.4. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 
Patients will be ra ndomized to TERN-101 or placebo using an Int eractive Web Response System 
(IWRS). Before the study is in itiated, the log-i n information a nd directions for the IWRS will be 
provided to each site.  
Approximately 96 patients will be randomized at an overall rati o of 1:1:1:1 into 4 groups 
receiving 5 mg (n = 24), 10 mg ( n = 24), 15 mg (n = 24) TERN-10 1 tablet, or matching placebo 
(n = 24). Randomization will en sure 6 patients at each TERN-101  dose level and 6 patients in the 
placebo group are assigned t o the PK/PD sub-study. 
Investigators, patients, all study personnel, and the Sponsor w ill remain blinded t o each patient’s 
assigned dose group throughout the course of the study. Study d rug will be dispensed at the 
study visits as summarized in Sche dule of Activities. Returned study drug should not be re-
dispensed to patients.  
6.4.1. Unblinding  
Treatment assignment may be unbli nded if knowing the patient’s treatment assignment would 
affect immediate medical management of the patient. The IWRS wi ll be programmed with blind-
breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the Investigato r has the sole responsibility for 
determining if unblinding of a patient’s intervention assignmen t is warranted. Pa tient safety must 
always be the first considera tion in making such a determinatio n. If the Investigator decides that 
unblinding is warranted, the Inve stigator should make every eff ort to contact the Sponsor prior to 
unblinding a patient’s interven tion assignment unless this coul d delay emergenc y treatment of

within 24 hours after breaking t he blind. The date and reason t hat the blind was broken must be 
recorded in the source documentation and case report form, as a pplicable. 
Any unblinding of Sponsor personnel for expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) or other reasons will be addressed in a separate plan.  
6.4.2. Patient Enrollment and Study Drug Assignment 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that patient eligibility is c onfirmed prior to 
randomization. Documentation of t he personally signed and dated informed consent of each 
patient, using the study-specific ICF, is required before initi ating the Screening Period.  
After written informed consent ha s been obtained, the patient’s  identification number will be 
obtained from the IWRS. Once e ligibility to partic ipate has bee n established, the randomized 
treatment assignment will be  obtained from the IWRS.

8.5. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occu rrence in a patient or clinic al study patient, temporally 
associated with the use of st udy drug, whether or not considere d related to the study drug.  
An SAE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence that, at a ny dose, results in the 
following: death; is life threatening; requires in-patient hosp italization; results in persistent 
disability or incapacity; is a c ongenital anomaly or birth defe ct; or is a medicall y important event 
or reaction that ma y not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but 
may jeopardize the pa tient or may require m edical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes in the definition.  
Events meeting the definition of  an AE or SAE are defined in Appendix 6, including details on 
recording, reporting, and follow- up of AEs and SAEs, assessment  of intensity, and assessment of 
causality. AEs will be reported by t he patient (or , when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or 
the patient's legally authorize d representative) at every study  visit.

recording events that meet t he definition of a n AE or SAE and r emain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, consid ered related to the study drug o r study procedures, or that caused 
the patient to disconti nue the study drug (see Section 7 ). 
8.5.1. Time Period and Frequency for Co llecting AE and SAE Information  
After informed consent but pr ior to initiation of study drug, t he following types of events should 
be reported: all AEs and SAEs related to pr otocol-mandated proc edures.  
Medical occurrences (events cons idered not related to protocol- mandated procedures) that begin 
before the start of study drug but after obtaining informed con sent will be recorded on the 
Medical History/Current Medi cal Conditions section of the eCRF not the AE section. 
All AEs and SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, will be collected from the start of study 
drug through the Follow-Up Peri od, at every study visit, as spe cified in the Schedule of 
Activities ( Section 1.3 ). 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or design ee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 6 . The Investigator will 
submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of i t being available. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek reports of AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the 
study participation. However, if th e investigator learns of any  SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a patient has bee n discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the st udy drug or study participation, th e investigator must promptly notify 
the Sponsor. 
8.5.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
The method of recording, evalu ating, and assessing causality of  AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and t ransmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 6 . 
Care will be taken not to introdu ce bias when detecting AEs and /or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of t he patient is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences. 8.5.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
After the initial AE and/or SAE report, the investigator is req uired to proactively follow each 
patient at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followe d until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or  the patient is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3 ). 
Further information on follow-up procedures is provided in Appendix 6 .

Prompt notification by the inves tigator to the Sponsor of a SAE  is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsib ilities towards the safety of patients and the safety of a study 
drug under clinical investigation can be met. 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local  regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a st udy drug under clin ical investigation. The Sponsor 
will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relat ing to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, IRB/ IEC, and investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs accordi ng to local regulatory

8.5.6. Assessment of Pruritus 
For patients who report AEs c onsistent with pruritus, photograp hs of the affected area(s) will be 
taken at the discreti on of the Investigator (eg, if there are v isible skin lesions; photos that would 
identify the patient, i e, of the entire face, will be avoided), and a qualified s taff member will 
administer the Pruritus N umerical Ra ting Scale ( Appendix 8) at each study visit where pruritus is 
reported or noted to be ongoing. If pruritus is reported, the c linical site will  provide details on 
these events in the eCRF.  
The Investigator will be asked t o provide an asse ssment of the severity of the A E using the NCI 
CTCAE v5.0 categories for  pruritus as follows:  
x Grade 1: Mild or localized; t opical interven tion indicated.

At Screening:  
x SARS-CoV-2 testing to assess for active infection (e.g. molecular test such as polymerase 
chain reaction [PCR] or viral a ntigen serology) and past infect ion (Immunoglobulin G 
[IgG] antibody required; Immunogl obulin M [IgM] antibody recommended in addition).  
x Prior to central laboratory testing availability, antibody testing may be omitted if not 
available locally. 
At Week 0, 6, and 12:  
x Testing for past infection via antibody testing (IgG required; IgM recommended in 
addition) if prior IgG was negative.  
x Prior to central laboratory testing availability , testing for a ctive infection (e.g. molecular 
test such as PCR or viral antig en serology) may replace antibod y testing if the latter is not 
available locally. 
x If Week 0 occurs within 2 weeks of Screening, site may omit repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing at PI discretion. 
x If IgM antibody test is positive, m ay reflex to test for SARS-C oV-2 active infection at 
Investigator’s discretion 
Ad-hoc:  
x In the event of symptoms sugge stive of COVID-19, ad hoc testing  (including molecular 
test such as PCR or viral antigen serology, and/or antibody tes ting, once available via the 
central laboratory), may be comp leted at Investigator’s discret ion. 
Sites may use local laboratory testing for COVID-19 assessments  instead of central laboratory, 
per site preference. If a local l aboratory is used, the results  must be entered into the eCRF. 
Results from previous testing m ay be used if completed within 2  weeks of a scheduled Screening 
or on-study visit. 
Any positive tests reflecting ac tive or recent infection (e.g. molecular test such as PCR or viral 
antigen serology, or IgM antibody) r equire management per local  public health guidelines, at the 
direction of the investigator. If technological changes result in changes to the assays implemented to assess for SARS-CoV-2, 
available central lab assays a nd testing mechanisms may change.  
The testing approach and sche dule may be modified based on the evolving landscape of the 
pandemic or in response to local public health requirements. In  that event, regulatory 
requirements, IRB requirements , and local institutional guideli nes will be followe d, as necessary.

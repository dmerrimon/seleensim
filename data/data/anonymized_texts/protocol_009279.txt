Protocol Number:  
A-101-WART 3 03  A Phase 3 Open Label Safety Study of A -101 Topical Solution for 
the Treatment of Common Warts  
Sponsor:  
Aclaris Therapeutics  
 Phase of Development:  
Phase 3  
Study Drug Description:  
 
A-101 Solution contains 45%  hydrogen peroxide that will be supplied in a single use 
applicator  to be a pplied directly to common warts (verruca vulgaris) t wice a week.     
 
The study drug, A -101 (hydrogen peroxide) 45% Topical Solution (hereafter referred to as A -
101) is a colorless solution that must be stored at room temperature (15- 25º C or 59 - 77 º F).     
Study Objectives:  
 
Primary:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety of A -101 45% when 
applied twice weekly to common warts .  
 Secondary : 
The secondary objectives of this study  include:  
• Efficacy of A -101 45% in the treat ment of recurrent and/or further treatments for new 
warts  
• Duration of response of A -101 45%  
• Onset of action of A -101 45%  
Study Design:   
This is a phase 3, open label, long term safety study of A -101 Topical Solution 45% in 
subjects with common warts.

    In order to be eligible for A -101-WART -303, subjects must have completed protocol 
treatment on either the A -101-WART -301 or A -101-WART -302 study.  
Subjects that have complete clearance of all warts at the end of A -101-WART -301 or A -101-
WART 302 may enter i nto the A -101-WART -303 study following completion of the Visit 1 
assessments.  These subjects will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or 
development of new common warts.  If a recurrence occurs or a new wart develops these 
subjects may re turn to the investigational site to receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a 
week for an additional 8 weeks.     
Subjects that have warts that have not cleared at the completion of A -101-WART -301 or A -
101-WART 302 may enter into the A -101-WART -303 study f ollowing completion of the Visit 
1 assessments and will receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for 8 weeks.  If at 
the completion of the initial 8 -week treatment course with A -101 Topical Solution 45% the 
identified warts are not clear, s ubjects m ay continue to receive repeated 8 -week treatment 
course with A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week. The final 8- week treatment course 
must be initiated by Day 122.   
 Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical 
chemistry), assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medication review.   
 
Efficacy will be evaluated based on assessment of each identified common wart  according to 
the Physician Wart Assessment (PWA) scale.  The Investigator should NOT refer to any other 
assessments or previous assessments  to assist with this evaluation.  
 
Number of Patients to be Enrolled:  
Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled  to the study.   
Number of Study Sites:  
This study w ill be conducted in the US only at approximately 50 treatment centers.   
Inclusion Criteria:

    4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Summary  
Warts are benign proliferations of the skin and mucosa that are caused by infection of 
keratinocytes by subtypes of the huma n papilloma virus (HPV) family.  Cutaneous HPV 
subtypes are a subset of this large group of the DNA papillomavirus family that is ca pable of 
infecting humans and causing cutaneous lesions. HPVs are ubiquitous in the environment and infection occurs most co mmonly through direct contact with individuals who harbor the virus 
clinically (evident  lesions) or sub- clinically, indirectly throu gh exposure to contaminated 
surfaces, or even by autoinoculation of virus from individual lesions to adjacent uninfected ski n. 
Cutaneous manifestations of HPV infection include common warts (verruca vulgaris), palmar 
and plantar warts, mosaic warts, flat w arts, and butcher’s warts. Common warts are generally 
small, rounded, hyperkeratotic, exophytic dome -shaped papules or nodul es and are typically 
associated with HPV subtypes 1, 2 or 4 though other subtypes are reported. Lesions are most commonly located on the fingers (including periungual and subungual regions), dorsal surfaces 
of the hands, and sites prone to trauma ( e.g., knees, elbows), but commonly occur at virtually any 
other anatomical location, potentially spreading by autoinoculation from the finge r/hand lesions . 
In immunocompetent individuals, many common cutaneous warts (up to 2/3rds in some reports) may spontaneously  resolve in less than 2 years. However, they often persist for many years, may 
be large and/or cosmetically unsightly ( e.g., face, h ands), spread to distant anatomical regions by 
autoinoculation, be painful and/or prone to trauma, and, importantly, provide  a significant 
reservoir of HPV infection in the community, placing (especially immunocompromised) individuals at risk for significa nt morbidity . 
There are currently no specific antiviral therapies available to treat cutaneous HPV infection and there is no  FDA -approved topical treatment for cutaneous common warts. Existing therapies, 
many of which are off -label uses of drugs approved f or other indications, and many of which 
have never undergone the drug approval process, are  of unproven safety and/or effic acy, and are 
generally directed towards either the direct physical destruction of the lesions with locally destructive or ablative m odalities such as cryotherapy, electrosurgery, curettage, application of 
acids ( e.g., salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid); locally cytotoxic therapies, such as topical 
podophyllin, cantharidin, topical or intralesional 5 -fluorouracil, or bleomycin; topical 
immunomodulatory or immunotherapy ( e.g., topical imiquimod, intralesional candida antigen, 
topical squaric acid dibutyl e ster) or lesion removal. Several of these therapies are also available 
as over -the-counter (OTC) wart therapies in l esser exposures than used in the office setting ( e.g., 
topical salicylic acid preparations, home freezing kits). Systemic therapy with agents such as 
cimetidine, and even local occlusion with duct tape have also been anecdotally reported to be 
effective in  some cases. While these methods may achieve cure in some cases, many require 
multiple visits to a physician’s office, and may require provi ders with specialized training and 
the use of expensive equipment. Such procedures can be painful, may require anest hesia and/or 
analgesia, and they can be complicated by adverse cosmetic outcomes including scarring at the treatment site, as well as the ty pical post -surgical risks of bleeding and infection. No one therapy 
is consistently effective in all cases and, in f act, there is great variability among practitioners in 
the methods employed using each of these techniques with great variability of the  results.

    Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest 
peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including 
chlorine -free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, a nd disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 
has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene 
products and tooth- whitening systems for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment 
of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, 
in addition to its use as an oral topical agent noted above, H 2O2 is widely employed at low 
concentrations ( e.g., 3% -6%) as a wound irrigant and topical antiseptic/disinfectant, and has been 
in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by Richardson in 1858.  ( Schumb, 
1955)  (Chan, 2008)  (Richardson, 1866) (Richardson, 1891) (Watt, 2004) ( Zonios, 2007) . 
H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of 
reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by the presence of a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidas e, superoxide 
dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, lipid peroxidase and others, as well as non-enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and uric acid, tocopherol, glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other water -soluble groups.  The local application of supra -
physiologic concentrations of H
2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, 
allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of 
reactive oxygen species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by the generation of local concentrations of O
2 that are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells . 
 
4.2. Study Rationale  
The rationale for the dose selection and treatment design of A -101-WART 301 and 
A-101-WART -302 and this open label, long term safety study is based on data 
collected from three completed (3) Phase 2 studies which assessed dose response 
and dose frequency of A -101 (H2O2) Topical Solution in patients with common 
warts.   All three studies demonstrated good efficacy and safety of H 2O2  45% for the 
treatment of common warts.   
The three studies conducted are identified below and they represent data collected 
from 406 subjects.  
• Study A -101-WART -201: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle- Controlled, 
Parallel - Group, Study of A -101 Solution in Subjects with Common Warts  
(n=90).  
• Study A -101-WART -202: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, 
Parallel Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Once a Week in 
Subjects with Co mmon Warts  (n=157). 
• Study A -101-WART -203: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel 
Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Twice a Week in Subjects with Common 
Warts  (n=159)

    On the basis of these successful Phase II studies, Aclaris has progressed to phase III with studies 
A-101-WART 301 and A -101-WART -302.  These studies will assess efficacy and safety of 8 
weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of post treatment follow up.  Aclaris recognizes that many patients may require multiple treatme nt courses and there is therefore a need to assess the long - 
term safety of topical H
2O2 45%.  A -101-WART -303 is therefore designed to assess the long- term 
safety of patients who were initially treated in studies A -101-WART -301 and A -101-WART -302.

    6. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a phase 3, open label, long term safety study of  A-101 Topical Solution 45% in subjects 
with commo n warts . 
In order to be eligible for A -101-WART -303, s ubjects must have completed protocol treatment 
on either the A -101-WART -301 or A -101-WART -302 study .  
Subjects that have complete clearance of all warts at th e end of A -101-WART -301 or A -101-
WART 302 ma y enter into the A -101-WART -303 study following completion of the Visit 1 
assessments.  These subjects  will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or 
development of new common warts.  If a recurrenc e occurs  or a new wart develops these 
subjec ts may return to the investigational site to receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a 
week for an additional 8 weeks .     
Subjects that have warts that have not cleared (or were not treated) at the completion o f A-101-
WART -301 or A -101-WART 302 may enter  into the A -101-WART -303 study following 
completion of the Visit 1 assessments  will receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for 
8 weeks. Subjects may continue to receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a  week for 8 
weeks if their warts are not clear at the end of the 8 -week treatment period but the 8 weekly 
treatments must be initiated by Day 1 22.   
Visit 1 of A -101-WART -303 can be the same day as Visit 13 of either A -101-WART -301 or A -
101-WART 302.   
All subjects will be required to remain on stud y for a total of 6 months.   
During the study, the investigator may  identify from 1 to 6 common warts  (during a 8 week 
treatment period)  to be treated twice a week for up to 8 weeks (maximum of 16 treatment 
applications) .  An 8 -week treatment course may be repeated.   
Refer to Table 2  and Table 3    and  for a complete list of protocol required study assessments.

    The study may be discontinued at the disc retion of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  Some examples of 
reasons for discontinuation are the occurrence of the following:   
• Increased frequency, severity or duration of known AEs  
• Medical, regulatory or ethical reasons  affecting the continued performance of t he 
study  
• Difficulties in the recruitment of subjects  
7.4. Withdrawal Procedures  
If a subject withdraws from the study prior to Day 182 (6 -month time -point) , the reason for 
withdrawal and the date of withdrawal from the s tudy must be recorded on the eCRF.  If the 
reason for withdrawal is an adverse event or a clinically significant abnormal laboratory test 
result, monitoring of the subject will continue until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the 
patient is refer red to the care of a local health care pr ofessional, or until a determination of a 
cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made.  
7.5. Subject Replacement  
Subjects that are determined to be screen failures may be rescreened for the study and if determined to be eligible for the study th ey may be randomized using the same subject identifier.  
A screen failure is a subject that signs an informed consent form for participation in the study but 
is determined not to be eligible for the study prior to the subject being randomized to the study.   
7.6. Subject Identifier (SI)  
The investigator or designee will assign a unique eight -digit subject identifier (SI) to each subject 
at Visit 1.  
The SI format will be NNN- NN-NNN where the first 3 digits associate the subject with either the 
301 or 302 study, t he middle 2 digits are  the investigational center site number (using leading 
zeroes, as appropriate)  and the final 3 digits are the subject number which was assigned during 
the parent study.  For exa mple, the SI for the second subject previously treated on the A -101-
WART -301 study that signs an informed consent at site number 04 would be  301-  04-002. 
The subject will be identified using the SI in all study documentation for the duration of the study.

    9. STUDY ASSESSM ENTS  
9.1. Identification of Common Warts 
Subjects who have completed participation in the A -101-WART 301 or A -101-WART -302 study 
are eligible to enroll into the A -101-WART - 303 study .  Subjects that were previously treated on 
the double - blind phase 3 study whose warts have recurred , were not treated  or who develop new 
warts during the observation period of A -101-WART - 303 are also eligible to receive treatment 
with A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for 8 weeks.  A n 8-week treatment period may 
begin anytime between Day 1 and Day 1 22.  
Warts that are identifie d by the treating investigator must meet the following criteria:  
• Subject may have 1 wart and up to 6 common warts treated during a n 8-week treatment 
period 
• Identified warts must have a longest axis of ≤ 8 mm.    
• Be a discrete  lesion, i.e. each wart meeting the entry criteria must be clearly 
separated from other warts  
• Not be a periungual, subungual, genital, anal, mosaic, plantar, flat or filiform wart 
• Not be in an intertriginous fold 
• Not be covered with hair which, in the Investigator’s opinion, would interfere with 
the study medication treatments or the study evaluations  
Not be in an area that may be occluded ( e.g., by clothing or footwear or in a  skin fold) . 
Each identified wart will be identified on the body charts in the subject’s eCRF.   
9.2. Common Wart Dimensions and Physician’s Wart Assessment (PWA)  
Each identified wart that will be treated with A -101 study medication will be measured using the 
Aclaris supp lied ruler.  The longest axis of each identified wart will be documented on the subject’s 
eCRF.   
The Physician’s Wart Assessment (PWA) is the Investigator’s assessment of the severity of each 
identified common wart  at a particular time -point. The Investig ator should NOT refer to any other 
assessments to assist with this evaluation. This evaluation IS NOT a comparison with the PWA  
performed  at any other  visit.  
During an 8- week treatment period, subjects will have their identified warts assessed using the 
PWA at the following time -points: Day 1, Day 29, Day 60 and Day 182.  
The Investigator will assess each identified common wart  and report the one integer that best 
describes the common wart  severity using the following scale.

2 A visible wart  ≥ 3 mm and < 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
3 A visible wart ≥ 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
The physician is encouraged to use a ruler or caliper and to feel the wart or skin area to help his/her 
assessment.  
Common warts that are assessed by the investigator as having cleared (PWA =0) will be  instructed 
not to continue to apply the A -101 study medication.   
Refer to Appendix  2 for the PWA Site Manual.  
9.3. Phone Call Visits 
Subjects that are enrolled t o the study that do not have any identified warts to be treated will 
complete the Visit 1 (can be the same day as V13 of  A-101-WART -301 or A -101-WART -302) 
assessment in the office and then will have telephone contact visits on Day 42, Day 84, and Day 126.   During these calls site staff will ask the subject if they have any adverse events that they feel are related to their  previous treatment with A -101 Topical Solution and if they have had a 
new wart develop or if they have had a recurrence of a wart that was previously treated on the A -
101-WART 301 or A -101-WART 302 study.  If a subject has a new wart or a recurrence they 
can be scheduled for an in -office visit and initiate treatment on another 8 -week treatment period 
with A -101 study medication.  If an 8- week treatment period is started then all assessments 
outlined in Table 2 must be followed.  A subject cannot start an 8- week treatment period after 
study Day 122.

10.6. Preparing the Study Medication for Application  
To perform a study medication treatment for  the identified common wart  a staff member will 
select the appropriate study medication applicator  from the identified subject’s kit. The following 
instructions  outline the procedure for application of the study medication to the ident ified 
common wart .  During each in- office treatment visit, the Investigational Study Staff will be 
responsible for reviewing the following instructions with the subject/parent/legal guardian and 
ensure that they understand how to properly prepare the appli cator and apply the A -101 study 
medication.  
• For the in- office treatment applications, the Investigational Study Staff member inst ruct 
the subject/parent or guardian to:  
o Washing their hands prior to applying the study medication .   
o Wear nitrile or vinyl ex amination gloves during the treatment; latex gloves are 
prohibited.  
o Visually inspect the applicator for damage:  
 If the applicator  appears damaged do not use it for the treatment, contact 
the study monitor for disposal instructions and select an unused appl icator 
with the next highest number for the treatment  
If the applicator is intact, proceed with the applicator preparation proces s as outlined in Figure  2.

    10.7. Applying Study Medication   
All subjects that are between the ages of 1 and 17 will have their A -101 study medica tion applied 
by a parent/legal guardian . Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not 
put the treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the 
treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after th e application, the area should be blotted dry.     
Subjects 18 years of age and older will apply their A -101 study medication to his/her identified 
common warts .  Study medication will be applied in the office on Day 1 and Day 29 prior to the 
PWA b eing per forme d. 
The following instructions will be used by all subjects/parents/legal guardians applying A -101 
study medication to all identified common warts :    
• Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or open 
wounds  
• Thoroughly cleanse the common wart  by firmly rubbing with a swab/wipe wetted with 
70% isopropyl alcohol  
• Using firm pressure and with the tip of the applicator held over the wart, squeeze in the middle of the applicator to apply one drop of study medication onto the c ommon wart .  
Using the smaller side of the applicator tip, move the applicator around in a circular 
motion to fully saturate the lesion.  Apply the study medication for approximately 15 seconds.   
• Minimize exposure to the surrounding norm al skin  
• During the  treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin 
using a clean absorbent wipe . 
• Ensure the i dentified common wart  is fully saturated with study medication at the end of 
the ~15 second application 
• Allow the treated wart to remain u ndisturbed for ~15 seconds  
• After ~15 seconds repeat the ~15 second application process  
• Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study  medication has been applied to each 
identified Wart up to 3 times.  
• If severe erythema and edema develop, then the tr eatment cycle should be discontinued 
for that specific treatment application.  
• Absorb any remaining A -101 study medication and dry the commo n wart  and the 
surrounding skin without wiping or   rubbing.  
10.8. Subject Instructions  
An investigational center staff memb er will dispense a Subject Instruction Sheet to each subject 
at Visit 1  (Refer to Appendix  1).

    12. ASSESMENT OF SAFETY 
In addition to reporting adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a designated and 
appropriately trained staff member or the subject, will perform the following safety as sessments 
according to the schedules noted below . 
12.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s assessment of the signs and the subj ect’s assessment of the 
symptoms associated with irritation at the identified common wart  site ( i.e., the common wart  and the skin 
immediately surrounding the common wart  exposed to study medication).  
The Local Skin Reaction signs to be assessed are:  
• Eryth ema 
• Edema  
• Erosion  
• Ulceration  
• Vesicles/bullae  
• Excoriations  
• Scabbing 
The Local Skin Reactio n symptoms to be assessed (by the Subject) are:  
• Stinging/burning  
• Pruritus (itch)  
The Investigator will evaluate the LSR signs at the each identified common wart site  as follows:  
• At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is  performed:  
o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application  
and 
The Subject will assess the LSR symptoms at the identified common wart site as follows:  
• At visits w here a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed:  
o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application 
At visits where NO  study medication treatment is  performed:  
o Perform an LSR  assessment.  
Subjects are to remain in the clinic f or 20 minutes after the application of their study medication.   
Any local  skin reactions or other adverse experiences that occur during this time period must be

12.2. Clinical Laboratory Sampling  
Subjects that do not have their Visit 1 the same day as Visit 13 of either A -101-WART 301 or A -
101-WART 302 will have to have a clinical chemistry and CBC performed.  Non -fasting blood 
samples for clinical laboratory analysis wi ll be collected by a qualifi ed staff member on Day 182 
for all subjects.  Approximately 7.5 mL of blood will be collected for each chemistry sample  and 
3 ml of blood will be collected for each complete blood count (CBC). These blood samples will 
be sent to  a central laboratory for an alysis.  Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for 
instructions regarding handling of the blood samples and shipping instructions.

    13. ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Defini tions 
13.1.1. Adve rse Events (AEs)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that develops or worsens 
in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical product and does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug.  An adverse event can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under 
study (or  any concu rrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following : 
• intercurrent illnesses ; 
• physical injuries ; 
• events possibly related to concomitant medication ; 
• significant worsening (cha nge in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre -existing conditions.  (N OTE: A condition, recorded as pre -existing, 
that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs during the study 
should be recorded as a n adverse event ); 
• Drug interactions; 
• Events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study;  
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities occurring after the start of the study (i.e., after screening and once confirmed by repeat tes ting) that results in the withdrawal of 
the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, 
or is considered by the study investigator to be clinically significant.  N
OTE: 
Abnormal laboratory test  results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from 
entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but 
will be recorded to monitor data  from patients who do not meet screening criteria . 
The investigator must, for any common wart  related AE, question the subject in detail 
to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by clothing or activity, 
sunburn) for any such AE . 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinicall y relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE . 
Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment s hould be 
reported as medical  history, not as an AE . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 
Protocol Version 3:  14 February 2019  
 47  
    13.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization; 
• Result s in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or  
• Is an important medical event.  
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
 Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the hospital on an in -patient basis, even if released the sam e day. Prolongation of hospi talization is defined as an 
additional night stay in the hospital. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
 Important medical events are those  that may not be immediately  life threatening, result in death or 
hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. Thes e 
should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.  
 
13.1.3. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The investigator must start re porting non- serious AEs starting with the subject’s first study 
medication tr eatment continuing until the subject’s last study visit. Non- serious adverse events 
that occur between the time the subject was consent ed and the first application of study 
medication will be reported as medical history . 
Reporting for SAEs begins after the subject signs the informed consent and continues until the 
subject’s last study visit (regardless of relationship to study medication).  If a subject  experiences 
a SAE after the subject’s last study visit,  that is deemed by the investigator to be related to study 
medication, the investigator must report this to the Sponsor using the study specific SAE report 
form . 
13.1.4. Severity  
The investigator must define the severity of each AE using  the following definitions as a 
guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the severity that is the mos t appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 
Protocol Version 3:  14 February 2019  
 48  
    Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity.  
13.1.5. Relati onship to Study Medication 
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and 
consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal  relationship, location of the event, the subject’s 
relevant medical history, concomitant the rapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the 
relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the st udy medication by selecting one of the following categories . 
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
study medication and the AE. 
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE . 
The term “reasonable causal relationsh ip” means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A . 
13.2. Reporting Procedures  
13.2.1. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will ques tion the subject to elicit AEs 
using a non- directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the 
previous study visit?”   
The Investigator/designee will monitor the subject for at least 20 minutes after the Treatment 
Completion Time at any visit during which a study medication treatment is performed to elicit AEs in a similar man ner. 
If appropriate, based on the subject’s response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the 
investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations . 
Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the appropriate AE CRF . 
AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or  until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as “Related” to the study 
medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject’s last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator, the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae .

    13.2.2. Procedure for Reporting Serious Ad verse Events  
Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not related 
to the study medications, the investigator must:  
1. Take the appro priate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety  
2. Immediately inform th e Aclaris of the SAE  by entering the event in to the Axiom database. If the 
Axiom database is unavailable, the site must fax a provided paper SAE form to Aclaris at the number 
below : 
 
Serious Adverse Event Facsimile:  484 -324-2359  
 
3. Within 24- hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any other 
relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, laboratory test 
results) must be enter ed in to the Axiom database . 
4. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the subject’s 
last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequel ae AND the investigator and Drug Safety Monitor  agree that the SAE  is 
satisfactorily resolved.  
5. Inform the Drug Safety Monitor  of SAE updates by telephone followed by an SAE form update 
entered in to the Axiom database . 
Comply with the appropriate regulator y requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions 
regardi ng reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics 
Committee (EC) . 
13.2.3. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be w ithdrawn from study drug at any time at 
the discretion of the inve stigator.  If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed 
at that time.  The patient will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, unti l a 
determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the 
patient is referred to the care of a local health care professional.  The investigator must inform 
the medical monitor as soon as possible of all patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events.  Additional reports must be provided when requested .

    14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Details of all statistical summaries and analyses  will be provided in the study specific Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
14.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
The sample size is based on an estimate of how many patients will be required to provide at least 
100 subjects requiring repeated treatment for a wart over the course of the study . 
• By recruiting 400 subjects, we estimate 200 subjects will have received act ive treatment 
in the A101- WART 301/302 studies. 
• We expected  approximately 26% of warts treated in A -101-WART -301/302 studies to be 
clear  at the en d of the A101- WART 301/302 studies . 
• Based on the assumption that 26% of warts will be clear, at least 148 subj ects will require 
exposure to active treatment.  
• We anticipate that some subjects originally randomized to vehicle will be  expos ed to 
active treatm ent. 
As a result, the study should exceed the target of exposing more than 100 subjects to repeated treatments  over the course of the study.  
14.2. Analysis Populations  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects consented in the study.  
14.3. Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  
Unless otherwise stated, all efficacy summaries and analyses will be conducted u sing the ITT 
population.  All efficacy summaries and analyses will be produced for the following groups:  
• Subjects treated in the  study that were r andomized to active treatment during the previous 
A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to vehicle during the previous A101-WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects treated in the study overall . 
• Subjects not requiring treatment during the study t hat were randomized to active 
treatment during the previous  A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects not requiring treatment during the study  that were randomized to vehicle during 
the previous A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects not requiring treat ment in the study overall.  
• All subjects combined

The primary efficacy analysis will be the effectiveness of A -101 45% based on the proportion of 
subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all identified common warts  at any 
scheduled visit .  Any i dentified common wart for a subject that has missin g PWA  data will be 
treated as not clear for the purpose of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 Four secondary efficacy analyses will be performed:  
• Durability of response:  for warts achieving a status of Clear (PWA=0), the number of weeks the wart remains clear will be tabulated and these results will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  The proportion of these warts that remain clear at the end of the 
study will also be prese nted.   
• Mean per -subject p ercent of treated warts that are Clear (PWA=0) at  each visit  will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics .    
• Proportion of subjects with a single wart at baseline whose wart is Clear (PWA=0)  will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics by visit.  
• Median time to achieve onset of Clearance (PWA=0) for all treated warts.  
Efficacy summaries will be supported by listings of PWA data.  
14.4. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data  
Unless otherwise stated, all safety  summaries will be conducted using the ITT population.  All 
safety  summaries will be produced for the following groups:  
• Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to active treatment during the previous 
A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to vehicle during the  previous A101-
WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects treated in the study overall . 
• Subjects not requiring treatment during the study that were randomized to active treatment during the previous A101- WART 301/302 s tudy.  
• Subjects not requiring treatment during the st udy that were randomized to vehicle during 
the previous A101- WART 301/302 study.  
• Subjects receiving active treatment during the study or the previous A101- WART 
301/302 study .  
The proportion of subjects w ith treatment em ergent adverse events will be tabulated and 
presented by System Organ Class and Preferred Term from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).   Likewise , the proportion of subjects with serious AEs will be 
summarized.   Adver se event summaries will be presented showing the pro portion of subjects 
experiencing adverse events, both overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class.  The version of MedDRA to be used for the analysis of this study will be specified in the SAP .

    Local skin reaction (LSR) scores and clinically relevant abnorma l laboratory results will be 
tabulated and presented at the subject level.  For each LSR sign and at each in -house visit, the 
proportion of subjects who had at least one treated wart with LSR severi ty >= 1 will be 
summarized.  
Safety summaries will be suppo rted by listings of all adverse events, laboratory results, and LSR 
data.  
14.5. Interim Analysis  
No formal interim analysis will be conducted for this study.

    15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
15.1. Protocol Amendments 
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IRB /EC, except when necessary to 
eliminate immediate safety concerns to the  study subjects  or when the change involves only 
logistics or adminis tration.  The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol 
amendment . 
15.2. Protocol Violations 
A protocol violation  is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specif ic inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, subject is administered a prohibited medic ation , and/or GCP guidelines .  Protocol 
violations will be identified and recorded, by study center personnel, on the CRF . 
As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptio ns to protocol -specific entry criteria 
to allow patients to enter a study.  If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered 
ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard 
Operating  Procedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study.  If 
investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligibility cr iteria 
was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must immediately  inform sponsor/CRO.  Such 
subjects  will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and 
written approval by sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP . 
15.3. Training  
For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study 
subjects . 
It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinators or other applicable personnel attend this visit.  During this visit, participants  will be 
trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs.  Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appr opriately trained individual prior to 
participating in any of the procedures and evaluations i n this study . 
Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol and other study specific items.  Team or ganization, communication and operational 
issues will also be discussed . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center . 
15.4. Monitoring  
The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. study monitor /CRO to verify adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable SOPs, the protocol, other written instructions and regulatory guidelines . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 
Protocol Version 3:  14 February 2019  
 54  
    The investigator will allow the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. representatives designee and/or and 
any regulatory agency to have direct access to all study records, CRFs, corresponding subject 
medical records, study medication dispensing records and study medication storage area, and any other documents considered source documentation.  The i nvestigator also agrees to assist the 
representative, if required . 
15.5. Data Management  
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study .  The data 
collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS)  that meets 
the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11.  The 
CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the  scientific, regulatory, and logistical 
requirements of the study before it is used to capture  data from this study.  Before using the 
CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training.  After they are 
trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights . 
The handling of data, including data quality ass urance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, 
including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions.  Data 
management and control processes s pecific to this study will be described in a data management 
plan.    At the end of the study, the database will be locked and the data will be released for  
reporting and statistical analysis . 
15.6. Quality Assurance  
The study is conducted under the sponsorship of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in compliance with 
the applicable regulatory requirements as wel l as applicable ICH guidelines, Helsinki 
Declaration, and in respect of the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and/or sub- contractor SOPs for study 
conduct and monitoring . 
Audits may be carried out by the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.’s representatives and inspections may be performed by regulatory authorities or IRB/ECs before, 
during or after the study.  The investigator will provide the auditi ng/inspecting group direct 
access to all study records ( e.g., CRFs, subject medical records, s tudy medication dispensing 
records) and the investigational center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be 
available and will assist the auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate . 
15.7. Record Retention  
All pertinent data, samples, photographs , correspondence, original or amended protocol, reports 
and all other material relating to the study will be maintained securely in Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc./CRO /investigator archives for the legally required duration for archiving . 
The investigator shoul d maintain the essential study documents as specified in ICH GCP, and in 
compliance with all regulatory requirements. The investigator should ensure these documents are protected from accidental destruction or disposal . 
If the Investigator needs to re -assign responsibility for maintaining these documents ( e.g., due to 
retirement) it must be transferred to a person willing to accept this responsibility.  The 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 
Protocol Version 3:  14 February 2019  
 55  
    investigator must notify Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., in writing, of the name and address of the 
new i ndividual . 
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigative site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor to store these in sealed containers in an off -site storage location so that they can be 
returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies will be made for off -site storage .  
No trial document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to assign the trial records to another  party or move 
them to another location, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor in writing of the n ew 
responsible person and/or the new location.

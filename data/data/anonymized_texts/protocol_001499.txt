SRC Version 3 6 April  22, 201 6 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objective   
• To evaluate if PET/CT  and PET/MR I scanners provide equivalent results for evaluation 
of cancer patients  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Preliminary information  
 
The recent introduct ion of hybrid PET/MRI scanners in cli nical practice (1-3) showed  
promising initial results for several clinical scenarios (4, 5). More than a decade ago, 
multimodality imaging was introduced into clinical routine with the development of the 
PET/CT . Since then, PET/CT has been widel y accepted in clinical imaging and ha s emerged 
as one of the main cancer imaging modalities. With the recent development of combined 
PET/MRI  systems for clinical use, a promising new hybrid imaging modality is now 
becoming increasingly available. The combi nation of functional information deli vered by PET 
with the morphologic and functional imaging of MR imaging (e.g., diffusion -weighted 
imaging, dynamic contrast -enhanced MR imaging and MR spectroscopy) offers exciting 
possibilities for clinical applications  as well as basic research. However, the differences 
between CT and MR imaging are fundamental. This also leads to distinct differences 
between PET/CT and PET/MR I not only regarding image interpretation but also concerning 
data acquisition, data processing  and image reconstruction. PET/MR I is expected to show 
advantages over PET/CT in clinical applications in which MR I is known to be superior to CT 
due to its high intrinsic soft tissue contrast. However, as of now, only assumptions can be 
made about the fut ure clinical role of PET/MR I, as data  about the performance of PET/MR I 
in the cli nical setting are still limited (6). 
 
2.2 Study Agent  
We will use 18F FDG  and 68Ga DOTA TATE  as the PET radiopharmaceutical s.  
 
2.3 Clinicaltrials.gov  
18F FDG is an FDA -approved product. Therefore no registration on clinicaltrials.gov is  
required.  68Ga DOTA TATE PET/CT is a lready registered on clinicaltrials.gov.  
 
2.4 Rationale  
The Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging  at Stanford  has two of the most 
modern  PET/CT scanners from GE Healthcare, the Discovery 600 PET/CT and Disc over 
690 PET/CT scanners. There will be a novel GE PET/MRI scanner installed at the Lucas 
Imaging Center. This will be the first of this kind t o be produced by GE Healthcare. 
Therefore it is important to determine if PET/CT and PET/MR I scanners provide equ ivalent 
results for evaluation of can cer patients.   
 
2.5 Study Design  
This is a non-randomized prospective trial. Patients who are referred to Nuclear Medicine for 
evaluation of extent of cancer and are scheduled to undergo the 18F FDG  or 68Ga DOTA 
TATE  PET/CT will be asked to have the scan r epeated on the  same day using  PET/MR I 
scanner. There will be a single injection of 18F FDG  or 68Ga DOTA TATE  followed by the  
PET/CT scan and immediately after by the PET/MRI scan . There will be no additional 
radiation t o the patient . This is because only o ne injection of 18F FDG  or 68Ga DOTA TATE  
will be given and the MRI uses non -ionizing radiation.

5.1 Modality or Modalities to be used  
 PET/CT  & PET/MR  
 
5.2 Details of Imaging (i.e. dynamic, static, number  of scans, etc.)  
Whole -body (skull base to mid -thighs) PET/CT images will be obtained using the GE 
PET/CT  600 and 690 scanners (GE Healthcare)  per standard oncologic protocols (7). In 
brief,  PET/CT images will be acquired in 3D mode at 45 -60 minutes after injection of 10 -12 
mCi of 18F FDG  or 5-7 mCi of 68Ga DOTA TATE . The PET emission scan is corrected using 
segmen ted attenuation data of the CT scan. The PET image s are reconstructed with a 
standard iterative algorithm (OSEM, two iterative steps, 28 subsets) using GE software 
release 5.0. All images are reformatted into axial, coronal, and sagittal views and viewed 
with the software provided by the manufacturer (AW,  GE Medical Systems).  
 
Immediately after completion of the PET/CT exam, the patients will be transferred to the 
PET/MRI suite at the Lucas Imaging Center and undergo the PET/MRI image acquisition  
with the l east delay . Acquisition will start in the pelvic r egion and move  toward the head.  
First, a localizer MRI scan will be performed to define the table position s. After correct 
positioning of the spatial acquisition windows will be  ensured, the combined PET/MR I 
acquisition will be initiated with 3 –5 table pos itions at a 4 -min acquisition time per table 
position . First, a coronal 2 -point Dixon 3 -dimensional volumetric interpolated breath -hold T1 -
weighted MRI sequence will be  acquired at each table position  and u sed for the generation 
of attenuation maps and for  anatomic allocation of the PET results. Simultaneously with the 
start of the Dixon MRI sequence, the PET acquisition will start  at the same table position , 
thus ensuring optimal temporal and regional corre spondence between MRI and PET da ta. 
The PET acquis ition time will be  4 min per table position , taking delayed acquisition times 
and radioactive decay into account. After completion of th e PET acquisition, the table will be  
moved to the next table position and the procedure will be  repeated. In the thorax and 
abdomen r egions, the MRI scans will be  acquired during breath -hold in shallow inspiration, 
similarly to the  acquisition of the low -dose CT (8). Other  sequences may also be used as 
needed (9). Multiplanar pre - and post -contrast MR ima ges may be obtained at multiple 
stations as needed . Images will be reformatted into axial, coronal, and sagittal views and 
viewed with the software provided by the manufacturer (AW, GE Medical Systems).  
 
5.3 Details of processing/analysis  
The PET/CT scans will be interpreted by ABNM certified Nuclear Medi cine physicians , while 
the PET/MRI scans will be reviewed by ABNM certified Nuclear Medicine physicians and 
ABR certified Radiologists. All these investigators have  significant clinical experience and 
will be blinded to the participan ts’ medical history an d the results of other imaging 
SRC Version 3 9 April  22, 201 6 modalities. Consensus read will be obtained for each scan. Each lesion will be tabulated and 
a comparison of lesion detection by each scanner will be conducted.

SRC Version 3 10 April  22, 201 6 8. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 Potential Adverse Events  
 
The administration of the radioactive substan ce will feel like a slight pinprick if given by 
intravenous injection. Patients who are claustrophobic may feel some anxiety while 
positioned in the scanner. Also, some patients find it uncomfortable to hold one position for 
more than a few minutes. The su bjects will not feel anything related to the radio activity of the 
substance in their body. Because the radioactivity is very short -lived, the radiation exposure 
is low. The substance amount is so small that it does not affect the normal processes of the 
body.  
 
There will be a single injection of 18F FDG  or 68Ga DOTA TATE  followed by 1 PET/CT scan 
and 1 PET/MR scan . There will be no additional radiation to the patient . This is because 
only one injection of 18F FDG or 68Ga DOTA TATE  will be given and the MRI  uses non -
ionizing radiation.  
 
Magnetic fields do not cause harmful effects at the levels used in the MRI machine. 
However, the MR scanner uses a very strong magnet that will attract some metals and a ffect 
some electronic devices. All such metallic objects  must be removed (if possible) before 
entering the  magnet room.  In some cases, having those devices means the patient  should 
not have an MRI scan performed. In addition, watches and credit cards should also be 
removed as these could be damaged. There is a  possibility that the patient  will experience a 
localized twitching sensation due to the magnetic field changes during the scan. This is 
expected and should not be painful. If the patient  had a previous reaction to g adolinium -
based contrast agents, a histo ry of severe allergies, or a history of kidney dis ease, he/she 
should  notify the operator/investigator.   
 
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
We do not anticipate hazardous situations for the subjects as a result of this protocol. 
However, procedures will be in place for verification of correct radiopharmaceuti cal dose 
and route of administration (i.e., each dose will be double checked for dosimetry and quality 
by a researcher and technologist). The study Principal Investigator (PI) or his designee will 
report un anticipated AEs related to the Stanford CCTO Safet y Coordinator within 10 working 
days of becoming aware of the event (5 days if the event is life -threatening or resulted in 
death) using the Adverse Events Communication Form. If the principal investigator 
determines the unanticipated adverse device effect  presents an unreasonable risk to 
subjects, the study will be terminated as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days 
after the PI makes the determination and no later than 15 working days after fi rst receiving 
notification of the effect.  
 
9. REGULAT ORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related 
to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit part icipants) will be reviewed an d approved 
by the Sta nford IRB.  Any changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification 
and will be approved by the IRB prior to implementati on. The Protocol Director will 
disseminate the protocol amendment informa tion to all participating investigators.  
SRC Version 3 11 April  22, 201 6  
9.2 Data  Management Plan  
 
The CRFs will be stored in a locked office in the Nuclear Medicine clinic. Records will be 
kept using OnCore.   
 
During the clinical investigation, the Protocol Director will evaluate the progress of the trial, 
including periodic assessme nts of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, 
accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of trial sites, and other 
factors that can affect study outcome.  Monitoring of the trial will occur every 8 weeks and a 
record  of monitoring activities will be maintained by the study team.  
 
The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will audit 
study related activities to determine whether the study  has been conducted in accordance 
with the protoco l, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP).  This may include review of regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility 
checklists, and source documents.  I n addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious  
adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the 
protection of human subjects.  Results of DSMC audits will be communicated to the IRB and 
the appropriate regulatory author ities at the time of continuing review, or in an e xpedited 
fashion, as needed.  
 
10. MEASUREMENTS  
 
10.1 Primary outcome measure  
 
We will evaluate the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 18F FDG or 68Ga 
DOTA TATE  in the lesions detected with both scann ers. There are now several papers 
based on other  vendors' scanners (no GE PET/MRI scanner built  yet). The authors showed  
that in oncologic patients  examined with PET/CT and PET/MRI , the SUV max values generally 
correlate well in  normal organ tissues. SUV max derived from PET/MRI can be used reliably in 
clinical routine. D ifferences observed between MRI  and CT derived SUV values may be 
attributed to the  time-delay between the PET/CT and PET/MRI scans  or biologic clearance 
of radiotracer  (10, 11). 
 
10.2 Measurement Methods  
 
Regions of interest will be placed around the lesions using the AW software (GE Healthcare) 
and the SUV max values from the images acquired with bo th scanners will be recorded.  
 
10.3 Measurement Time Points  
 
SUV max values of the lesions will be measured after the scan completion.  
 
10.4 Response Review  
 
The SUV max values will be analyzed by Nuclear Me dicine  and Radiology  physicians blinded 
to the dia gnosis and results of the other scan, in a randomized order to avoid bias.  Two 
physicians will review all scans independently . Both scans of a given patients will be 
analyzed by one physician, then separate ly by the second physician.  
SRC Version 3 12 April  22, 201 6 11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERAT IONS  
 
11.1.  Statistical Design  
 
Single arm prospective study of paired imaging studies.  
 
11.2.  Randomization  
 
This study is to compare the images from two different scanners: PET/CT and PET/ MR and 
patients are scanned with both scanners.  No randomization will be done . 
 
11.3.  Interim analyses  
 
No interim analyses are planned.  
 
11.4.  Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis  
 
(see below)  
 
11.5.  Primary Analysis   
 
11.1.1.  Analysis Population  
 
 Analysis population: all lesions  identified  by either modality (per -lesion analysis) . 
 
11.1.2.  Analys is Plan  
 
Normal quantile plots of SUV max for each scanner will be prepared to assess to what extent 
the distribution can be approximated by the normal distribution, and to suggest a suitable 
transformation if not. The distribution of SUV max for each scanne r will be summarized with 
means, standard deviations, range, median and upper and lower quartiles. The distribution 
of the difference (SUV max_PET/CT  – SUV max_PET/MRI ) (difference of transformed values if 
applicable) will likewise be summarized.  Cumulative distribution (waterfall plots) may be 
prepared to assist in the evaluation of the results.  Patient clinical and demographic 
characteristics will be summarized using relevant summaries (proportions for categ orical 
variables, means and standard deviations fo r continuous variables . 
 
The mean difference plus or minus twice the standard deviation of the difference will be 
calculated as a measure of absolute accuracy. The relative accuracy will be calculated by 
dividing the preceding interval by the arithmetic av erage of the mean SUV max of the two 
scanners. The interpretation of these intervals is that we can expect that approximately 95% 
of future differences to lie in these intervals. A paired t -test will be used  to aid in the 
interpretation of the results.  Sen sitivity analyses may be conducted using linear mixed 
effects models to account for possible clustering of lesions within patients.  
 
The difference of SUV max measures will be correlated with patient and les ion characteristics 
and with time after injection using the appropriate method (Pearson correlation for 
continuous variables such as age and time from injection, two -sample t -tests for binary 
attributes (sex) and analysis of variance for categorical variab les). 
 
11.6.  Sample Size  
SRC Version 3 13 April  22, 201 6  
Data from Kershah (10) shows coefficients  of variation between SUV measurements 
between PET/CT and PET/MRI ranging from 0.21 to 0.51, about 0.33 for CT attenuation 
correction and 0.38 for MR attenuation correction. We present calculations assuming a CV 
of 0.38 for both modalities and a Pearson co rrelation of 0.5 (moderate scenario) and 0.9 
(optimist ic scenario). Assuming a Pearson correlation of 0.5 on the log scale, 200 subjects 
provide 80% power to detect a relative difference of 8% between the SUV max values using 
the two modalities. Wit h an optimis tic assumption of a Pearson correlation of 0.9, 20 0 
patients provide 80% power to detect a relative difference of 3.4%. These differences do not 
seem minute, they will be a bit larger with only 100 subjects: assuming a Pearson 
correlation of 0.5 on the log  scale, 100 subjects provides 80% power to detect a relative 
difference of 11% between the SUV max values using the two modalities. With an optimistic 
assumption of a Pearson correlation of 0.9, 200 patients provide 80% power to detect a 
relative difference  of 5%.  
 
 
11.7.  Accrual estimates    
 
We expect the accru al of 100 patients. There are approximately 4500  patients scanned 
each year using PET/CT  for cancer , of which approximately 100 patients are Ga68 DOTA 
TATE PET/CT patients . We plan to enroll 15 participants /year  and this is easily achievable 
given our expe rience with other protocols.   
 
11.8.  Criteria for future studies  
  
 At this time there are no future stud ies planned beyond the initial 100 participants.

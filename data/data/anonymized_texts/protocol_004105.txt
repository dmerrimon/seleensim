Date: 3/13/2018 Page 5 Background and Rationale  
Regional  anesthesia is commonly used for elective and emergency cesarean delivery. It 
provides numerous safety advantages when compared to general anesthesia for both 
the mother and fetus1.  Epidurals also have the added benefit of being able to provide 
pain relief throughout labor and in the event of cesarean delivery, epidural analgesia 
can be “extended”  to provide surgical anesthesia.  Numerous studies have been 
performed to assess the o nset times of various loca l anesthetics when administered 
through an epidural catheter. Attempts to reduce anesthetic onset time and improve the 
quality of intraoperative analgesia have been attempted by using different local 
anesthetic solutions and by the addition of other drugs to the epidural solution (such as 
epinephrine, fentanyl and sodium bicarbonate).  
A recent meta -analysis concluded that the optimum local anesthetic solution for 
extending a labor epidural from analgesia to surgical anesthesia has yet to be 
determined 2.  In 1994, a retrospective study compared 1.5% 
lidocaine/bicarbonate/epinephrine mixture to 3% chloroprocaine in parturients with pre -
existing epidural catheters for urgent cesarean delivery3.  It was found that the 
chloroprocaine gr oup had a significantly faster onset of anesthesia compared to the 
lidocaine group.  Both drugs provided excellent anesthesia. However a high quality 
study comparing 3% chloroprocaine with 2% lidocaine/  epinephrine/  bicarbonate/ 
fentanyl (LEBF) in terms of  anesthetic onset times has yet to be performed.  
Women in labor frequently request an epidural to provide pain relief.  Epidural pain relief 
is commonly provided by the administration of a low concentration of local anesthetic 
and opioid solution through a n epidural catheter. This solution is delivered by an 
automated epidural infusion pump. In the event that a cesarean delivery is required, the 
pre-existing epidural is frequently used to administer a higher concentration anesthetic 
solution to allow pain f ree cesarean delivery. This is commonly referred to as an 
“epidural top up” or as a n “extension of the epidural block.”  
Our standard practice at UAMS for an epidural top up is LEBF or 3% chloroprocaine. 
These two mixtures are routinely and almost exclusive ly used for epidural cesarean 
delivery. The decision on which mixture to use is based solely  on physician preference . 
It is likely that the LBEF mixture is used more frequently but we consider both local 
anesthetic mixtures as equals  and the standard of care at UAMS. We do not use any 
other local anesthetics (unless there are very specific reasons) . 
Specific Aims  
The aim of this study is to compare the speed  of onset and anesthetic quality of our two 
current clinical  dosing regimens  (LBEF and a solution of 3% chloroprocaine)  in elective

Date: 3/13/2018 Page 6 cesarean delivery.  We hypothesize that the use of a 2% lidocaine/  epinephrine/ 
bicarbonate/ fentanyl mixture will have an equivalent onset time to surgical anesthesia 
as compared  to 3% chloroprocaine.  
Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome will be the onset time to surgical anesthesia , as reported by the 
participant using a standard procedure  This will be measured by the time taken  from the 
end of the epidural loading dose to develop a loss of touch sensation using a neurotip®  
(Owen Mumford, USA) device bilateral ly at the T7 dermatomal level.  
A blunt plastic neurotip® will be loaded onto a neuropen® (Owen Mumford, USA) which 
will give a standardized 40 gram force.  Sensory testing will be performed from caudad 
to cephald (i.e. from blocked  to unblocked dermatomes) to identify  the first unblocke d 
dermatome.  
Secondary Outcome  
We will compare the i ntraoperative supplementation rate  between the two groups .  This 
is defined the percentage of women who require additional drugs to control pain during 
the elective ce sarean section in each arm of the tri al.  
Exploratory Outcome  
The following will be abstracted from the medical records:  
• Maximum pain Visual analogue scale (VAS) during surgery (as reported by patient, 
scored from 0 -10 in the PACU).  
• Incidence of side effects:  
o Nausea (self-reported by patient, yes or no).  
o Vomiting (observed yes or no).  
o Itching (self -reported by patient, yes or no).  
• Use and dose of vasopressor phenylephrine ( 80-160 mcg bolus) and Hartmann’s 
solution (200 mls bolus). Indicated to be given if the BP drops greater than 20% 
below baseline or <100mg Hg systolic.  
• Overall patient satisfaction score, (asked and scored from 0 -10). 
• Motor block at end of the cesarean delivery (measured in the PACU).  
• Neonatal Apgar scor es. 
• Umbilical cord blood gases taken after delivery (arterial and or venous).  
• Opioid consumption over 24 hours postoperatively  
This is a single center, double blinded, randomized study.  Our usual practice for 
extending epidural analgesia for urgent cesar ean sections consists of a mixture of 2% 
lidocaine, epinephrine , bicarbonate  and fentanyl (LE BF) or 3% chloroprocaine.  The

Version #: 7  IRB # 207313  
Date: 3/13/2018 Page 7 local anesthetic mixture used is dependent on the anesthesiologist’s preference.  LBEF 
tends to be used more frequently than chloropr ocaine in our unit (estimated 2:1 ratio)    
Both drugs provide a rapid onset of surgical anesthesia with little need for intraoperative 
analgesic supplementation.  
The aim of this study is to compare the speed of onset and anesthetic quality of our two 
curre nt clin ical dosing regimens (LEBF, and a solution of 3% Chloroprocaine) in elective 
cesarean delivery.   Both 2% lidocaine and 3% chloroprocaine are licensed and 
commonly used in epidural catheters for cesarean delivery.  The results of this study 
should also be applicable to epidural anesthesia in the setting of urgent cesarean 
deliveries.  
Due to the complex ities of performing a research study in the setting of an urgent 
cesarean delivery, we propose testing our hypothesis in patients scheduled for elective 
cesarean delivery. As such we will be deviating from our standard care, which normally 
involves spinal,  epidural or combined spinal -epidural (CSE) performed in the operating 
room directly before cesarean delivery.  Instead a CSE  will be inserted preoperatively in 
women shortly before their elective cesarean section  (usually 1 - 2 hours before 
surgery) . This w ill allow us to closely replicate the conditions involved in extending an 
epidural that is used for analgesia in laboring women to surgical anesthesia for 
unexpected cesarean delivery.   
The epidural infusion will be commenced with  our standardized local an esthetic mixture  
(0.0625% bupivacaine with 2mcg/m l fentanyl)  through an automated infusion pump.  
This is normally used to provide pain relief in laboring women. Th is epidural infusion 
pump  will continue  until the scheduled time of cesarean delivery .  The woman will then 
be transferred to the operating room and the epidural will be extended/ topped -up with 
either chloroprocaine or LE BF (according to randomized group assignment) so as to 
assess the onset time of anesthesia for cesarean delivery.  Both local anesthetic 
mixtures (LBEF and chloroprocaine) are commonly used in other hospitals within the 
region for elective and emergency cesarean delivery. We almost exclusively use these 
two mixtures in our unit for women who require unscheduled cesarean del ivery if they 
have already had an epidural placed. For elective cesarean delivery our normal practice 
involves either spinal or CSE anesthesia, epidural anesthesia is more likely to be used 
for select case s dependent on clinical condition.

Study Design  and Procedures  
Screening/Baseline Phase  
The anesthesiologists performing the pre -operative evaluation will alert a member of the 
study team if the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the study.  Following informed 
consent, we will obtain demographic and clinical information including, but n ot limited to, 
height, weight, age, current medications, medical diagnoses, and history of anesthesia 
complications.  Standard non -invasive vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory 
rate, and temperature) will be obtained  from the pre -operative work up .

Version #: 7  IRB # 207313  
Date: 3/13/2018 Page 9 Pre-operative Phase  
Patients who have been enrolled into the study will have a combined spinal -epidural 
(CSE) inserted in the patient’s room on admission to the Labor & Delivery Suite (L&D) 
shortly before  (usually 1 -2 hours)  their elective cesarean section. Patients who are not 
enrolled in the study would normally receive either a  spinal or CSE in the operating 
room at the time of their surgery . Dosing and monitoring will be the same as for any 
patient who requires a CSE for labor analgesia  or cesarean delivery.    
To proceed with the next phase of the study (see below), the subject will require a 
functioning epidural. This will be assessed  by the anesthesiologist after insertion of the 
CSE by confirming a negative test dose an d the establishment of a bilateral T10 – T12 
sensory block. This is standard practice.  
Intra -operative Phase  
The patient will be transferred from her room (where the CSE was inserted) to the 
operating room according to her scheduled time of cesarean deliv ery.  The epidural 
pump will be discontinued and anesthesia care will be c onducted in the same manner 
as all cesarean deliveries under epidural extension anesthesia.  The anesthesiologist 
will confirm that no blood or CSF can be aspirated from the epidural catheter before the 
administration of the test dose and study solution.  
Motor block of the lower extremities will be evaluated using the Bromage scale (1 –4; 1, 
no block; 4, complete motor block).  The motor block will be assess ed on at least three 
occasions:  
1. Before administering the epidural extension anesthesia  
2. When the sensory level reaches the T7 dermatome  
3. Postoperatively on admission to PACU  
Sensory block will be tested (using a standard procedure) at  the end of the epidura l 
loading dose . Loss of touch sensation  will measured  using a neurotip®  (Owen Mumford, 
USA) until a sensory  bilateral  block to  the T7 dermatomal level  has been reached . The 
T7 level will be marked bilaterally with a washable marker pen  to guarantee precisi on of 
the primary end point.  A blunt plastic neurotip® will be loaded onto a neuropen® (Owen 
Mumford, USA) which will give a standardized 40 gram force. Sensory testing will be 
performed from caudad to cephald (i.e. from blocked  to unblocked dermatomes) to  
identify the first unblocked dermatome.  
To identify the level where the sensation of touch is first appreciated, the investigator 
will ask the question: “Tell me when you feel something touch your skin.”  Both the motor 
and sensory block evaluations are part of the standard clinical care of patients receiving 
epidural anesthesia.

The study solution will be given in three phases:  
1. Test Dose  
• 3 mls given initially from the 30 -ml syringe labelle d:  Epidural Study 
(Induction 1)  
2. Induction  
• The remaining volume from the 30 -ml syringe labelle d:  Epidural Study 
(Induction 1)  
• Epidural Study (Induction 2) syringe may be used if required to further 
extend the epidural block (as per instruc tions below ) 
3. Maintenance  
• A 10-ml syringe labelled Epidural Study (Maintenance) given at 40 
minutes after the test dose  
Participants in the study will be randomized to receive one of the two study solutions as 
described above.  These solutions in syringes w ill be prepared by an un -blinded 
anesthesiologist in the adjacent operating room prior to the epidural top -up.  The 
patient's initials and study number will be displayed on each syringe. The un -blinded 
anesthesiologist will have no other role in the patien t’s care other than the prepa ration 
of the study solution  and replacing the term “study solution ” within the patient s’ medical 
record , to the actual drugs that were given . In the event of an emergency situation 
blinding would be broken and the treating anesthesiologist would be informed of what 
study solution was given.  
A second anesthesiologist, blind to the choice of local anesthetic will manage the 
clinical care of the patient from the beginning of the study (insertion of the epidural) and 
will administer the epidural study solution. There will be no difference in this clinician’s 
care of the subject than if she were not enrolled in the study.  They will assess the onset 
of anesthesia  and manage all aspects of the subject’s clinical care  includ ing the 
documentation  of the “study solution” , timing, and clinical effects of the study 
medication.  The speed of onset will be assessed from the end of epidural top up .  This 
will be defined as time zero and the start of anesthesia.  The primary outcome will be 
the time taken to lose touch sensation from a neurotip/pen device at the thoracic 
dermatome level 7 (T7). See below for a description of this assessment.   
The primary outcome will be documented on a separate data collection tool  (which the 
un-blind ed anesthesiologist will not have access to) . The blinded anesthesiologist will 
continue to manage all aspects of the subject’s clinical care  until completion (PACU 
discharge). If required intra -operative analgesia will be offered in the form of further 
epidural top -up, intravenous fentanyl, ketamine, nitrous oxide or replacement of

discretion.  These are all commonly used medications that provide pain relief during 
cesarean s ections in the event of breakthrough pain.  The choice of which drug to use is 
at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. This information will be abstracted from medical 
records.   
Intra -operative Monitoring  
As with all cesarean sections full monitoring in the operating room will be applied and 
will be the same whether the participant is in the study or not.  
Concurrent Medication  
Subjects enrolled in the study will be treated as per normal practice for electiv e 
cesarean section. If a general anesthetic must be instituted, the subject’s participation in 
the study will be stopped.   
Assessment  of Primary Efficacy Parameters  
Assessment will be made of the sensory level after the epidural loading/induction dose. 
This will give an indication of the suitability of surgical anesthesia before proceeding 
with cesarean section. This will be assess ed by the blinded clinical anesthesiologist with 
a NeurotipTM device, 2 minutes after the completion of the epidural top -up and  then 
continuously if possible or at  intervals of approximately 1 minute until a T7 level is 
acquired to touch sensation. Motor function will be assessed using the Modified 
Bromage Score.  This is standard clinical monitoring , except for the fact that the s ensory 
level will be assessed  continuously / approximately every one minute as opposed to the 
ad hoc assessments  which are normally done.  
Epidural Study Solutions  
The solutions and their administration procedures are identical to those used outside 
this research and are almost exclusively used for epidural top up anesthesia for non -
scheduled cesarean delivery. All patients enrolled will randomly receive one of the t wo 
study solution s exactly prescribed as below which is our routine practice.  
 
Epidural Study Solution 1  
Test Dose and Induction  
Twenty ( 20) mLs of Chloroprocaine 3% (Nesacaine – Fresenius Kabi), will be drawn up 
into a 30 -ml syringe from 1 x 20 -ml single dose vial of 3% Chloroprocaine.  4 mls of 
0.9% sodium chloride will be added to the syringe. Thus the total volume in the syringe 
will be 2 4 mls. 3 mls of this solution will be initially administered through the epidural.

Epinephrine/  Bicarbonate/ Fentanyl for Epidural Anesthesia in Elective Cesarean Delivery  
PI : Nadir Sharawi, MD  
Site: University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences  
 
Version #: 7  IRB # 207313  
Date: 3/13/2018 Page 12 This is the test dose.  After three  minutes the anesthesiologist will assess the patient for 
any signs of accidental intrathecal or vascular administration.  If there are no signs of 
accidental wrong route administration then the remaining volume of solution will be 
given via the epidural catheter over approximately two minutes.  This will be the 
induction dose.  The total volume that will be administered to the patient at this stage 
will be 2 4 mls. 
Ten ( 10) mls of 3% Chloroprocaine will be drawn up in a 20-ml syringe.  This solution 
will be given if the initial induction dose is not effective. If a bilateral block to touch 
stimulus at the T7 dermatome level has not been achieved within 15 minutes after the 
end of the induction dose, then a further 5 mls of study solution will be given. If after 25 
minutes  (total elapsed time after giving induction dose) , a sensory block to T7 has not 
been achieved then a further 5 mls of study solution can be given. If at 35 minu tes (after 
induction dose)  the sensory block has not reached T7, then the subject will be 
withdrawn from the study and the anesthesiologist can induce anesthesia in whichever 
way they think is best. At this point the anesthesiologist will also break blindi ng.  
Therefore,  the total volume of local anesthesia that can be given to the patient at this 
stage is 3 4 mls (24 mls induction dose + a further 5 or 10 mls if the initial induction dose 
is not effective).   
Maintenance  
Ten ( 10) mls of Chloroprocaine 3% will also be drawn up in a separate 10 ml syringe. 
This solution will be administered once only over 3 – 5 minutes, 40 minutes after the 
completion of the induction dose.  
Epidural Study Solution 2  
Test Dose and Induction  
Twenty ( 20) mls of Lidocaine 2% HCL (Xylocaine – Fresenius Kabi), which will be 
drawn up into a 30  ml syringe from 4 x 5 ml ampoules of 2% Lidocaine. The following 
additives will be added:  
1. 0.15 ml of 1:1000 epinephrine  
2. 2 mls of 50 mcg/ ml of fentanyl  
3. 2 mls of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate  
Thus the total volume in the syringe will be 2 4.15 mls. At the start of epidural extension 
anesthesia a 3 mls test dose will be administered through the epidural (as previously 
described above).  After three minutes, if there are no sign s of accidental spinal block or 
intravascular administration then th e remaining volume of study solution will be 
administered over approximately two  minutes.  This is the induction dose. The total 
volume that will be administered to the patient at this stage will be 2 4.15 mls.

Date: 3/13/2018 Page 13 Ten (10) mls of 2% Lidocaine (with the addition of 0.1 ml of 1:1000 epinephrine) will be 
drawn up in a 20 ml syringe.  This solution will be given if the initial induction dose is not 
effective.  If a bilateral block to touch stimulus at the T7 dermatome level has not been 
achieved 15 minutes after the end of the epidural top up, then a further 5 mls of study 
solution will be given.   At the 25 minute mark  (total elapsed time after giving induction 
dose)  a further 5 mls of study solution can be given in an attempt to achieve a sensory 
block to T7. If at 35 minutes (after induction dose) the sensory block has not reached 
T7, then the subject will be withdrawn from the study and the anesthesiologist can 
induce anesthesia in whicheve r way they think is best.  At this point the anesthesiologist 
will break blinding.  Therefore , the total volume of local anesthesia that can be given to 
the patient at this stage is 3 4.15 mls (24.15 mls induction dose + a further 5 or 10 mls if 
the initial  induction dose is not effective).  
Maintenance  
Ten (10) mls of 0.9% sodium chloride will also be drawn up in a separate 10 ml syringe.  
This soluti on will be administered once only over 3 – 5 minutes, 40 minutes after the 
completion of the induction dose.  
This is our usual practice except for the following:  
• we are being very precise in regards to docum entation of time  
• monitoring the sensory block continuously or approximately every one minute (as 
opposed to every few minutes)  
• the addition of saline to study solution 1, t his is to allow equal volumes of local 
anesthetic solutions and maintain blinding  
Post -operative Phase  
Participants will be admitted to the PACU after completion of the operation. Care will be 
as per the standar d of care for all elective cesarean deliveries.  Pain scores, motor and 
sensory block assessments, and cumulative opioid usage over the first 24 hours 
postoperatively, will be abstracted from the medical records of these subjects after 
discharge.  
Before d ischarge from the PACU, the un -blinded anesthesiologist would access the 
patient’s medical record and replace the charted “study solution” with the actual drugs 
administered before closing the anesthetic record.

Version #: 7  IRB # 207313  
Date: 3/13/2018 Page 15 Risks and Benefits  
The benefits and risks to t he study participants overall  will be the same as all patients 
presenting to L&D for elective cesarean delivery.  That is, whether a patient decides to 
participate or not in the study, the normal standard of care is neuraxial anesthesia 
(spinal, epidural or  combined spinal -epidural) for cesarean delivery as opposed to 
general anesthesia. Below is a brief summary of the three main neuraxial anesthesia 
techniques; spinal, epidural and CSE.  
Spinal Anesthesia  
The majority of elective cesarean delivery is performed under spinal anesthesia. The 
main advantage of spinal anesthesia is its fast onset , good quality anesthesia  and it is a 
relatively simple anesthetic technique. The main disadvantage is that spinal anesthesia 
has a limited duration of action (unde r two hours) and intraoperative pain will require 
supplementation with intravenous drugs or conversion to general anesthesia  
CSE and epidural anesthesia  
These techniques will be considered together as they are similar. We rarely use 
epidural anesthesia for  elective cesarean delivery, mainly because its onset of action is 
much slower than spinal anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia is routinely used for 
nonscheduled cesarean delivery , where laboring patients will likely already have an 
epidural in place. The epid ural is then “toped up” allowing the conversion of labor 
analgesia to surgical anesthesia. Hence the main advantage of epidural anesthesia is 
the ability to extend analgesia or anesthesia for as long as required. This also allow s the 
administration of furt her local anesthetic solution through the epidural to treat any 
episodes of intraoperative pain without having to convert to general anesthesia.  
A CSE technique combines the advantages of spinal and epidural anesthesia. 
Therefore, it is routinely used for elective cesarean delivery (but less than spinal 
anesthesia). The disadvantage of the CSE technique is that is the most technically 
challenging of the three anesthetic techniques as it combines both a spinal and an 
epidural.  
Risks of CSE and epidural  anest hesia  
• The benefits and  risk of spinal, epidural, CSE and general anesthesia are 
routinely discussed with the patient as part of the anesthetic pre-assessment and 
informed consent as a standard of care. The subject with be exposed to very 
similar risks if t hey decided to be part of this study or not as they will most likely 
receive neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural/CSE) as opposed to general 
anesthesia  if they decline to be in the study . However, subjects enrolled into this 
study will all receive CSE ane sthesia. The only unique risk to participants in this 
study due to CSE anesthesia is : Inadvertent intravascular injection. This risk can

Version #: 7  IRB # 207313  
Date: 3/13/2018 Page 16 be minimized by aspirating blood through the epidural catheter and administering 
a ‘test dose’ of local anesthetic +/ - epinephrine.  
• Our standard CSE equipment is composed of a spring wound catheter. This 
greatly reduces the risk of the epidural catheter entering a blood vessel and 
hence the risk of intravascular administration  
• The above interventions are usually enough to  minimize the risk of any hazards 
to intravascular injection that we do not normally include intravascular injection 
as part of the consent process.  
Advantages and disadvantages  of having a CSE placed early  
As part of this study’s protocol, participants w ill have a CSE placed early . The benefits 
include having the anesthetic technique placed in the participants room, in a more 
relaxed environment and in a less rushed manner than in the operating room. The 
subject can also have their birthing partner to sup port them during the procedure, which 
would not be possible if the procedure were to be done in the operating room.  
There are also disadvantages of having a CSE placed early. The main disadvantage is 
likely to be a reduction in the patient’s mobility. We e xpect the CSE to be placed 1 - 2 
hours before the scheduled cesarean delivery. During this time that the epidural pump is 
running , the subject is given instructions not to walk. Their options will be to stay on the 
bed or the chair. Any mobilization (from t he bed to the chair or vice versa) will require 
the assistance of  a nurse . A urinary catheter is not required.  
Research related risk to study participants include  the potential for loss of 
confidentiality.  Measures to protect the confidentiality of study participants will be 
implemented as described in the Data Handling and Recordkeeping section below.   
There will be no direct benefits to the study participants; ho wever, knowledge gained 
from the study could potentially benefit patients in the future.  
Study Medication Risks  
Lidocaine  with epinephrine and chloroprocaine  
These medications are considered together as they are both local anesthetic drugs that 
will be adm inistered through the epidural route:  
Severe allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  
• Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat. This may make it difficult to swallow.  
• Severe or sudden swelling of the hands, feet and ankles.  
• Difficulty breathing.  
• Severe itching of the skin (with raised lumps).

Date: 3/13/2018 Page 18 Side effects  to the fetus:  
• Local anesthetics rapidly cross the place nta and when used for epidural,  can cause 
varying degrees of fetal and neonatal toxicity. Adverse reactions in the parturient, 
fetus and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system, peripheral 
vascular tone and cardiac function.  
• It is not known whether these drug are excreted in human milk  
Sodium Bicarbonate (frequency unknown)  
• Tissue necrosis, ulceration or sloughing has been reported following extravasation at 
the site of injection.  
• Compensatory hyperventilation, paradoxical acidosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, 
severe hypokalemia, volume overload, pulmonary oedema, shortness of b reath, 
muscle weakness (associated with potassium depletion). Muscle hypertonicity, 
twitching, hyperirritability and tetany may develop especially in hypocalcaemic 
patients. Seizures may be exacerbated or precipitated in epileptic patients.  
• It is not known  whether sodium bicarbonate can cause fetal harm when administered 
to a pregnant  woman or whether it is excreted in human milk  
 
Fentanyl  
Very common side effects (affect more than 1 in 10 people) include:  
• muscle stiffness • feeling sick (nausea), or being sick (vomiting)  
 
Common side effects (affect less than 1 in 10 people)  
• feeling agitated • jerky or uncoordinated movements • drowsines s • dizziness • 
blurred vision, blind spots or haloes around lights (visual disturbances) • a slow 
or irregular heartbeat • unusually low or high blood pressure • pain along your 
veins • choking caused by cramping (spasm) of the muscles of your throat • 
wheezing or difficulty breathing • stopping breathing for a short period of time. If 
necessary your breathing will be helped by a machine (ventilator). • an itchy rash 
or redness of the skin • confusion  
Uncommon side effects (affect less than 1 in 100 peopl e) include:  
• a feeling of extreme happiness (euphoria) • headache • swelling and clotting 
along a vein • changes in blood pressure • breathing faster than usual • hiccups • 
decrease in body temperature or chills • breathing complications Other side

breathing • itching of the skin  
 
Side effects to the fetus  
• In women treated acutely with IV or epidural fentanyl during labor, symptoms of 
neonatal respiratory or neurological depression were no more frequent than 
would be expected in infants of untreated mothers  
• Fentanyl is excreted in to human milk and achieves levels in colostrum which are 
greater than maternal serum levels. No adverse effects have been reported in 
nursing infants.  
Risk Mitigation  
All subjects will be observed in a unit accustomed to treating patients recovering from 
surgery and anesthesia . Customary clinical care will be provided by the patient’s 
treating physician. No standard treatments will be withheld as a result of participation in 
the study.  
Drug Accountability and Subject Compliance  
This study will take place within the UAMS hospital’s labor and delivery unit. There will 
be full drug accountability throughout the study. There will be an accountability log, 
labels for each ampoule marked especially for the study (Epidural Study). Study  drugs 
will be prepared by one anesthesiologist (un -blinded) and administered by another 
anesthesiologist (blinded). The dose of study solution in milliliters given to the patient 
will be documented within anesthetic recor d by the blinded anesthesiologists. Initially  
this will be documented only as “study solution” After completion of the study, the un -
blinded anesthesiologist will complete the anesthetic record by entering the names of 
the actual study medications  given. Compliance will be confirmed by comparing the 
medical chart to the accountability logbook.  
Data Handling and Recordkeeping  
The Principal Investigator will carefully monitor study procedures to protect the safety of 
research subjects, the quality of the data and the integrity of the study.  All study s ubject 
material will be assigned a unique identifying code or number.  The key to the code will 
be kept in a locked file cabinet and password protected Principal Investigator’s 
computer in the Principal Investigator’s office.  Only Nadir Sharawi, MD and Ji ll Mhyre, 
MD will have access to the code and information that identifies the subject in this study. 
At the conclusion of the study, the data will be permanently deidentified.  Deidentif ied 
study data will be maintained and ultimately destroyed per UAMS po licy.

Date: 3/13/2018 Page 20 Data Analysis  
The null hypothesis is that chloroprocaine group will have a slower onset time to 
achieve loss of touch sensation at the T7 dermatome compared to the LE BF group.  
The alternative hypothesis is that the chloroprocaine group will have no difference in 
onset time to achieve loss of touch sensation at the T7 dermatome compared to the 
LEBF group.  
For statistical analysis, the Student’s t - test will be used for continuous  normally 
distributed variables and the Mann -Whitney test for nonpara metric variables. Linear 
regression analysis will be used to assess any relationship between the pre top -up 
parameters and the subsequent speed of onset of the block.  
Sample Size  
The sample size will be calculated for continuous outcome date for a non -inferiority 
study. We have assumed that an onset time difference of three minutes is the largest 
difference that is clinically acceptable, so that a difference of more than three minutes 
would matter in clinical practice. If there is truly no difference betwee n the LE BF group 
and the chloroprocaine group, then 62 mother -infant dyads  are required to be 90% sure 
that the lower limit of a one -sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two -
sided co nfidence interval) will be above the non -inferiority limit  of 3 minutes with a 
standard deviation of 4 minutes. Therefore 31 patients will be recruited to each arm. 
Statistical significance will be taken as P < 0.05. In total, 70 female patients will be 
recruited to account for any withdrawals.  
Randomization  
Thirty-five pieces of paper will be printed for each group containing 3% Chloroprocaine 
or 2% LE BF for a total of 70.  Each of the individual piece of paper will then be placed in 
a sealed envelope.  A ll envelopes will be shuffled and then numbered 1 – 70. 
Patients will be assigned a number 1 – 70 as  they are enrolled in the study.  The 
envelope will be obtained and opened by an un -blinded anesthesiologist revealing their 
randomization group.  The un -blinded Anesthesiologist will not be involved in the 
patient’ s care or data collection. They will prepare the epidural study solution and close 
the patient’s anesthetic record at the end of the study after charting which study solution 
was administered by th e blinded anesthesiologist. They will not be aware of prima ry 
outcome result as this will be documented on a separate data collection form. All 
members of the patient’s care team are blinded to the assignment study drug.  The un -
blinded anesthesiologist will inform the clinical team which drug was used if determine d 
to be clinically necessary.

Subjects will have the right to withdraw from the study at any point in time and have the 
right to withdraw any accompanying data. The study has been powered to account for a 
10% withdrawal rate.  
Stopping the Study  
Epidural anesthesia will be discontinued if the woman experiences significant pain that 
is not relieved by the intraoperative analgesic supplementation described above or if the  
patient is no longer able to continue with  epidural anesthesia. At this point the subjects’ 
participation is over. Depending on the clinical scenario, an alternative anesthetic 
technique will be offered, usually general anesthesia.  
Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations 
and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences research policies and 
procedures.   This protocol  and any amendments will be submitted and approved by the 
UAMS Institutional Review Board (IRB) to conduct the study.    
The formal consent of each subject, using the IRB -approved consent/HIPAA form, will 
be obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.   All subjects for this 
study will be provided a consent /HIPAA form describing this study and providi ng 
sufficient information in language suitable for subjects to make an informed decision 
about their participation in this study.   The pers on obtaining consent will thoroughly 
explain each element of the document and outline the risks and benefits, alterna te 
treatment(s), and requirements of the study.   The consent process will take place in a 
quiet and private room, and subjects may take as much time as needed to make a 
decision about their participation.   Participation privacy will be maintained and quest ions 
regarding participation will be answered.    No coercion or undue influence will be used 
in the consent process.   This consent/HIPAA form must be signed by the subject and 
the individual obtaining the consent.   A copy of the signed consent/HIPAA will b e given 
to the participant, and the informed consent process will be documented in each 
subject’s research record.   
Dissemination of Data  
Results of this study may be used for presentations, posters, or publications. The 
publications will not contain any identifiable information that could be linked to a 
participant.

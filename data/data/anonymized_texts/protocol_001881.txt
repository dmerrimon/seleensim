 5 Research Protocol  
 
Title A low-cost virtual reality gaming platform for neurorehabilitation of hemiparesis  
 
I. Objectives  
A relatively recent rehabilitation strategy, constraint -induced movement therapy (CI therapy), produces subst antial 
recovery of arm function. Although viewed as the “gold standard” intervention for arm hemiparesis by many practitioners, CI therapy is unavailable to most patients due to its cost, travel/scheduling demands, and dearth of trained providers. For example, CI therapy is typically not covered by insurance and the 30+ hours of assessment and physical training usually cost patients upwards of $6,000. Most patients are required to travel long distances, often out of state, multiple times a week to seek this care. Many of these patients have only intermittent access to 
transportation and/or limited financial means to travel. Thus, patient dissatisfaction with not receiving adequate 
rehabilitation is high and there is a fundamental need for low -cost, accessible interventions with the potential to 
improve arm func tion. The objective of this project is to test, in collaboration with the patients it is designed to serve, 
a home -based, computer-gaming version of CI therapy that will provide high- quality rehabilitation to patients who 
are typically not afforded access to effective therapies.  
 
Aim 4: A larger randomized controlled trial will be conducted, comparing the effectiveness of a 3D video game 
delivery model of CI therapy versus traditional clinic -based CI therapy and standard care.  
 
Our team’s long -term goal is to use newly available technological innovations to increase access to motor 
rehabilitation while reducing cost of care. In keeping with our overall program of research, the proposed 
work aims to establish the comparative effectiveness of a three-dimensional (3D) video game delivery model 
of CI therapy versus traditional clinic -based CI therapy and standard care. Data from this trial will enable 
individuals with hemiparesis to evaluate whether a home -based video game therapy has  the potential to meet 
their rehabilitation goals compared to clinic -based CI therapy and traditional rehabilitation approaches. We 
propose a multisite randomized controlled trial with two subaims:  
Aim 4a: To determine the comparative effectiveness of a th erapist -as-consultant video-game delivery model 
of CI therapy.  The Motor Activity Log  (a reliable  and valid measure of arm use for daily activities) and the 
Wolf Motor Function Test (measures time required to perform functional movements) will serve as pri mary 
motor outcome measures.  
Aim 4b : To examine individual factors that may differentially influence response to one treatment versus 
another.  Initial motor ability, cognition, somatosensation, intensity of both in -clinic and home -based motor 
practice, treatment compliance, age, and chronicity will be examined as potential moderators of motor 
outcome . 
II. Background and Rationale  
 
CI therapy is a highly efficacious motor rehabilitation therapy for stroke or hemiparesis of other etiologies.  
It has been shown to substantially increase the amount of use of an affected upper extremity  5-7 and to promote 
structural and functional brain plasticity.  8-12 CI therapy is distinctive from traditional rehabilitation in several 
ways. 1) It involves a highly compressed and intensive training schedule (training of the more impaired arm on functional tasks for 3 hours daily for 10 consecutive weekdays).  2) CI therapy incorporates restraint of the less-impaired (i. e., “good”) hand for a target 90% of waking hours.  Restraint is delivered via a padded mitt that 
discourages the patient to engage in compensatory behavior with the less affected arm
 13,14 and teaches the 
patient to use the more-affected (i.e., “bad”) arm  for daily activities. 3) CI therapy utilizes a number of behavioral 
techniques termed the “transfer package.” The transfer package was designed to facilitate transfer of therapeutic 
 
 
 6 gains to real world activities, thereby enabling the patient to overcome the conditioned suppression of movement 
(e.g., learned nonuse) characteristic of chronic hemiparesis.13,14 Transfer package techniques include daily 
monitoring of life situation use of the more affected arm via daily administration of the Motor Activity Log (a structured interview that monitors use of the more -impaired arm for 28 daily activities), providing feedback on 
patient progress, and problem -solving with the therapist to overcome perceived barriers to using the extremity.  
 
The transfer package is perhaps the most revolutionary element of CI therapy in that it leverages 
psychological theory to induce behavioral change. Patient gains in real -world arm use are reduced by 
approximately 67% when it is omitted from the CI therapy protocol.
12 Furthermore, patients fail to 
demonstrate the brain reorganization that is typical of CI therapy in the absence of the transfer package.12 
Behavior -monitoring and problem -solving elements (strongly emphasized by the transfer package) are 
present in most empirically -validated psychological interventions that target behavior change and their 
importance to the field of physical rehabilitation is becoming increasingly apparent. Traditional approaches 
to motor rehabilitation that heavily emphasize strength, speed, or “normalcy” of movement (i.e., motor 
training only), and do not incorporate elements of the transfer package, often yield motor gains that do not 
translate into improved function for the patient (i.e., the patient still operates unimanually at home). Through use of the transfer package, CI therapy patients regain their ability to use both arms for daily tasks, enabling  
them to retain motor gains over time.  
Despite its effectiveness, CI therapy is available to less than 1% of the estimated 1.2 million chronic 
stroke survivors who could benefit from it.  Common barriers to access include dearth of trained providers, 
cost, insurance caps, and travel/scheduling demands. Although in its infancy, telemedicine is an emerging 
field with substantial promise to produce exceptional interventions at low cost that can be widely distributed. 
Most studies to date have found that virtua l reality interventions are at least as effective as their low-
technology counterparts.
1-4  To deliver CI therapy to underserved individuals, a novel patient -centered 
approach to rehabilitation was developed that utilizes newly developed, inexpensive, and commercially 
available gaming technology (Microsoft Kinect).  Initial evidence from a pilot trial of this system suggests 
that improvements in motor speed, an outcome of prime importance to stroke survivors, are approximately 
equivalent to those reported in the traditional CI therapy literature. Qualitative data reveal that the technology 
is accepted irrespective of age, technological expertise, ethnicity, or cultural background. A randomized clinical trial is now required  to provide reliable (level 1) evide nce of the effectiveness of this novel model of 
CI therapy delivery.  
III. Procedures  
 
Aim 4.  To compare the effectiveness of a 3D video game delivery model of CI therapy versus traditional clinic-
based CI therapy and standard care in a randomized controlled trial. 
 Administration 
 
OSU will serve as the lead site for a multi -site trial. Communication between sites will occur through quarterly 
phone calls (and more frequently if needed) between OSU PI and the PI of the sites. In -person site visits will also 
occur at the beginning of the project and again after sites have obtained ~25% enr ollment. Video -based site visits 
may replace in -person site visits in some instances as appropriate. Site trainings will occur at each site and will 
include procedures necessary for maintaining data security and participant privacy (e.g., procedures for uploading study testing forms to secure REDCap database at OSU).   The central database for the project will be maintained at OSU (REDCap). All records for the study will be 
scanned in by each site and uploaded to REDCap. Adherence to study treatment and testing protocols will be checked by a blind rater at OSU whose job is to randomly review  video-taped treatment and testing sessions. 
Significant deviations from protocol will be addressed by retraining personnel or termination (if the problems 
 
 
 7 persist). Video data (e.g., see above) will be transferred to OSU from the other sites via USPS on encrypted 
storage drives.  
 Unanticipated problems (from all sites) will be reported to the OSU PI, OSU’s central IRB , as well as to the 
PIs of individual sites .  To avoid a potentially large volume of repor ts of external adverse events, the HHS Office 
of Human Research Protections (OHRP) has released guidance urging that individual adverse events should only 
be reported to investigators at all institutions when a determination has been made that the events meet the criteria for an unanticipated problem. OHRP recommends that any distributed reports include: (1) a clear 
explanation of why the adverse event or series of adverse events has been determined to be an unanticipated 
problem; and (2) a description of any proposed protocol changes or other corrective actions to be taken by the 
investigators in response to the unanticipated problem.  Adverse event reporting for the proposed research will 
follow this model.  
 An initial analysis of data will be conducted at OSU after 50% total recruitment.  These interim findings  will 
be shared with other site PIs by the OSU PI . Decisions to modify the protocol based on interim findings will be 
made jointly between all the sites to ensure protocol consistency. Interim findings that may influence protocol safety and willingness to participate will be reported to the IRBs at each institution  by the PIs at each institution.   
 Research Design  
 
Individuals with chronic stroke will be randomized to one of four different interventions: (1) traditional 
clinic -based CI therapy (35 therapist/client contact hours), (2) therapist -as-consultant virtual reality CI 
therapy (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic and 15  hours of independent game play at home), (3) 
therapist -as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy with additional therapist contact via telerehabilitation (5 
therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 6 additional brief  teleconference sessions, and 15  hours of 
independent game play in the home), and (4) 5 hours of standard occupational therapy. The clinic -based CI 
therapy arm is the "gold standard" against which gaming therapy is compared (group 1 versus group 2 and group 3). The comparison to standard care (group 2 versus group 4) will demonstrate whether game -based 
treatment between therapy sessions enhances motor outcomes. The comparison between groups 2 and group 3 will determine the extent to which additional therapist monitoring via video conference improves treatment response of a home -based intervention. Motor function (Wolf Motor Function Test) and daily use of the 
more affected hand (accelerometry) will be measured prior to treatment, after treatment, and 6 months later.  
Sample  & Inclusion/Exclus ion Criteria  
Relatively relaxed enrollment criteria will be employed to include a representative sample of patients with 
upper extremity motor impairment. Patients who have experienced a stroke (of any etiology) resulting in 
hemiparesis at least six months prior, have preserved ability to comprehend and participate in basic elements 
of the therapy, who have corrected vision of at least 20/70 (individuals with low vision would have difficulty participating in the gaming intervention), who are not currently participating in other experimental upper extremity trials, who are not currently engaged in other outpatient rehabilitation for their upper extremity, and who have not received Botox within the last 3 months (confound) will be eligible to participate. Eligible 
participants will receive an in -person screening to ensure their ability to safely engage in rehabilitation. 
Patients deemed too frail to undergo intensive rehabilitation or those with serious, uncontrolled medical 
problems will be excluded (e.g., debilitating pain). The recruited sample will represent approximately 50% of 
individuals with hemiparesis. Participants will be stratified by severity of impairment (see table below) and separately randomized to reduce potential baseline inequality between gr oups.

Measurement/Instrumentation  
 Primary measures:  
- Motor Activity Log  
-  Wolf Motor Function Test  
 Secondary measures: - bilateral activity monitors (accelerometers)  
- Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)  
- Touch Test Monofilaments  
-  Neuro -QOL   
-     9-Hole Peg Test 
-     Brief Kinesthesia Test  
- Kinematic Analysis (performed on skeletal Kinect data collected during game play)  
- Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  
 
Measures will be administered within a week prio r to beginning treatment, in the week following treatment, 
and at 6 -month follow -up ( ±1 month). A rehabilitation professional blinded to treatment condition will 
perform the testing. Reliability of the blinded assessors will be monitored by videotaped assessments 
reviewed by independent raters.  
 
Additional quality metrics that could create apparent differences in effectiveness in clinical populations will also be measured. After completion of participation, we will survey participants to collect qualitative feedback regarding their experiences with the treatment. Participants will be asked about which therapy 
condition (traditional CI therapy, gaming CI therapy, standard therapy) they would have preferred under 
ideal (i.e., cost and transportation are not an issue) and realistic (i.e., their current resources are a consideration) conditions. Differential adherence will also be examined by the proportion of therapy sessions 
attended, hours of mitt use objectively quantified by a sensor in the mitt, hours of game play, and self -
reported compliance with home practice.

 Recruitment  
 
Participants will be primarily recruited through mining the electronic medical records (e.g., through 
Information Warehouse at Ohio State  University Wexner Medical Center  and the Quality and Patient Safety 
Department at OhioHealth) to  generate a list of potentially eligible participants [not deceased individuals 
with an ICD-9 diagnostic code of 438.2 (chronic hemiparesis) or 438.3 (chronic monoplegia of upper limb)  
or ICD-10 equivalent]. After obtaining approval to contact potential participants from their treating providers, they will be informed of the study through a mailing. Interested participants will contact the site coordinator to be screened for participation. Memb ers of the health system who use a system such as OSU 
MyChart will also be recruited via targeted messaging (to those who may meet recruitment criteria based on the diagnostic codes above). A message would appear in their MyChart account, telling them very  briefly 
about the study and asking them if they are interested in learning more.  If they indicate on MyChart that they 
are interested in being approached about research participation, the PI will receive a message to follow up with the potential participa nt. Participants will also be recruited from community stroke groups, from internet 
forums, via study flyers posted within the community,  from the general clientele of the outpatient clinics, 
through internet advertising (e.g., Facebook), through direct ma iling (e.g., USPS Direct) and through the use 
of Research Match . Internet advertising, direct mailing, and study flyers posted within the community will be 
used to specifically target rural dwelling participants.   Detailed Study Procedures  
The current proposal aims to conduct a multi -site randomized controlled trial comparing virtual-reality 
gaming delivery of CI therapy with (1) traditional clinic -based CI therapy of equal total duration  and (2) a 
control group equating the dose of in-person therapy. Individuals with chronic stroke will be randomized to one of four different interventions: (1) traditional clinic -based CI therapy (35 therapist/client contact hours), 
(2) therapist -as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy (5 therapist/client contact hou rs in the clinic and 15 
hours of independent game play at home), (3) therapist -as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy with 
additional therapist contact via telerehabilitation (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 6 brief contacts 
via teleconference, and 15 hours of independent game play in the home), and (4) 5 hours of standard 
occupational therapy. After 6 -month follow -up, individuals assigned to standard OT/PT will cross over to a 
modified gaming therapy condition (a stand-alone application of the rehabilitation game without additional therapist contact).  This crossover design is ethically responsible and will enable the team to test the 
feasibility and initial efficacy of a completely stand -alone implementation of the game , 
as well as to 
determine the effect of varying amounts of therapist contact on game -based rehabilitation outcomes (group 2 
vs group 3 vs group 4 crossed over).

Group 1, Traditional CI therapy:  We will employ a 35 -hour “dose” of CI therapy in the current trial. All 
elements of traditional CI therapy will be provided.  Treatment will consist of 35 therapist/client contact 
hours in the clinic, over the course of 3 weeks. Delivery of the “transfer package” will occur during the other 5 hours and will include the following elements: (1) establishing a behavioral contract (in which goals for the intervention are set, the therapist secures the client’s “buy in,” a plan for increased use of the more affected 
upper extremity in the home setting is drafted, and a schedule of mitt use is established), (2) daily 
administration of the Motor Activity Log (self -assessment of weaker arm use for daily activities), (3) a daily 
diary of new activities attempted at home is reviewed, and (4) problem -solving to overcome barriers to use of 
the more affected upper extremity is conducted. In addition, the client will agree to wear a padded restraint mitt on the less affected hand for the majority of waking hours  to encour age use of the weaker hand for daily 
activities. The restraint mitt is equipped with a sensor to provide the participant with feedback on how long 
he/she has worn the mitt. Finally, the participant will agree to 30 minutes per day of individualized task -
practice outside the clinic (in addition to training in the clinic) focused on functional activities catered 
towards accomplishing the person’s therapeutic goals. 
 Group 2, Gaming CI therapy . This intervention is designed such that physical/occupational ther apists 
manage patients in a consultative role, thus allowing more patients to be served. 5 therapist/client contact hours will occur in the clinic on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and will focus on treatment elements that cannot be readily add ressed through the game (e.g., transfer package with guided problem -
solving). The first session with the therapist (2 hours) will involve establishing the behavioral contract, reviewing the Motor Activity Log (from pre -test) with guided problem -solving, and customizing the game to 
the participant. Thereafter, sessions will focus on review of progress with the home program, modifying game customization as needed, and on treatment elements that cannot be readily addressed through the game (e.g., guided proble m-solving portion of the transfer package with ADL practice as needed, establishing 
home skill assignments collaboratively). Matching the CI therapy delivery schedule, 15 hours of progressive 
massed motor practice will occur through in -home video game play over 3 weeks. Participants will play the 
game during times of their choosing. The proposed delivery system thus allows patients access to 
rehabilitation between episodes of care provided by therapists. This distribution of activities amounts to the 
same amount of  active motor practice as CI therapy (15 hours) and 5 hours of “transfer package” activities, 
equivalent to that of traditional CI therapy. In lieu of the mitt, the participant will wear an activity monitor 
biofeedback device for the majority of waking hours . As with traditional CI therapy, the client will agree to 
an additional 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice.  
Game play is driven by the user’s movements that are captured with the Microsoft Kinect/Xbox One 
camera (cost of less than $500). The Microsoft Kinect is a controller -free motion capture device with built -in 
video cameras and 3D depth sensors to capture and record participant motion. An ava tar then replicates the 
participant’s movements in the gaming environment. The “controller -free” environment makes the Kinect 
system user -friendly for patients who are not accustomed to technology and provides monitoring of the 
user’s actual movements. Its intuitive design is thus ideal for rehabilitation applications in which individuals 
may have little comfort with technology or substantial cognitive impairment. It is well suited for rehabilitation because it requires no devices or wires to be attached to  the person and can capture fairly 
accurate representations of coordinated motor patterns. Components of the system include a computer with PC Kinect (or Xbox One integrated gaming console), an armless chair where the patient can safely sit to 
perform the game, and a 
television  display.  
 
 
 11 The movements required to navigate the game environment were designed to be intuitive (based on 
input from our stakeholders), while also focusing on motor routines known to be helpful for recovery of 
hemiparesis (e.g., extension, supination). Various therapeutic gestures (e.g., how the hand moves relative to 
the shoulder and elbow) drive game play. Therapeutic gestures were coded with a focus on minimizing reinforcement of compensatory movement patterns and have been validated on more than 40 individuals with hemiparesis.  
The game environment (also developed with input from stakeholders) consists of a quest down a 
river canyon that winds through various terrains (mountains, tropical, dessert, and underground caves). The 
user must paddle a kayak through this terrain, collecting hidden treasure, fishing for food, capturing essential 
supplies that are parachuted down from above, gathering food, and pulling objects from the river. The user must remain vigilant; bats and otherworl dly creatures can attack in the caves, river rapids can crash the kayak 
into the rocks, and low hanging obstacles need to be avoided or the avatar will develop a headache.  
To promote the extended game -play required for CI therapy and enable customization to the user, the 
game utilizes procedural content generation (mathematical algorithms that generate game content based on therapist specifications and continuously change game scenery “on the fly”).  The CI therapy principal of shaping (progressively increasing task difficulty as a person improves) is automated through the game. In just one example, bats flock around the avatar’s head to encourage the user to raise the paretic hand above the shoulder and across the body. To disperse the bats, the player must “swat” the bats out of the way with 
the paretic hand. An introductory level of this gesture may require only that the paretic hand reaches above 
the level of the navel. As a person’s range of motion improves, the game advances the player to reach across midline in addition to above shoulder level and, eventually, to higher above the shoulder and further across the body.  
As with traditional CI therapy, the game also incorporates some elements of the “transfer package” 
that promote transfer of motor gains t o daily activities. One such element is the Motor Activity Log (MAL). 
It is a highly structured self -monitoring interview that asks patients how effectively their more affected arm 
performed activities of daily living over the past 48 hours. Daily administ ration of the MAL is believed to be 
the most important element of the “transfer package” because it provides self -monitoring of arm use and 
problem -solving regarding how the client can incorporate use of the more affected upper extremity into 
his/her daily  routine. To automate this self -assessment, the user matches his/her performance to a video of a 
stroke participant performing each task. If participants answers that he/she did not perform an activity, a problem -solving module appears in which the user must select from various strategies that may aid him/her 
in performing the task (strategies were provided by therapist stakeholders).    Group 3, Gaming CI therapy  with additional contact via video conference. This group will receive 
treatment that is identical to Group 2, but will receive an additional 6 brief video conference consultation s 
throughout the treatment period so that this group receives the same number of therapist encounters as the CI 
therapy group . 
 
Group 4, Traditional occupational/physical therapy focusing on the upper extremity. Five 
therapist/client contact hours will occur on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 (same schedule as 
gaming CI therapy).
 The treatment protocol was developed collaboratively by therapists on our Advisory 
Board given the question: “What protocol would you utilize if you were only given 5 contact hours to treat a 
client [with mild/ moderate hemiparesis]?” Although responses differed somewhat regarding the relative amounts of time devoted to the following activities, an average protocol was constructed consisting of the following: 1-hour progressive resistance exercise to establish and progress an upper extremity home exercise 
program, 2 hours of neuromuscular reeducation, and 2 hours functional practice on ADLs with verbal 
encouragement to use the more affected upper extremity to the largest extent possible. Home practice 
consists of stretching exercises, designed to increase range of motion, prescribed twice daily. After compl eting their participation in the standard OT condition (6 months), participants will be crossed over  to a 
CI therapy gaming only condition. This condition will be identical to that described above, excluding therapist contact throughout the intervention. F ollowing an initial consultation with a therapist, participants 
 
 
 12 will receive a DVD explaining the intervention and guiding them through self -management . The rationale for 
crossing over participants in the standard occupational therapy condition is two-fold : 1) this will allow 
testing the efficacy of a stand -alone implementation of the game (the only feasible treatment option for 
participants who are unable to access a clinic), and 2) it is ethically responsible given our hypothesis that the 
standard OT group will show inferior outcomes compared to the groups receiving CI therapy or gamified CI therapy.  
 
Data handling - The OSU CCTS Research Informatics Services Core will be used as a central location for 
data processing and management. Vanderbilt University, with collaboration from a consortium of 
institutional partners (including OSU) and the NIH National Center for Research Resources, has developed a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical trial data. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) data collection projects rely on a thorough study -specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by all members of the 
research team with planning assistance from the CCTS Research Informatics Services Core. As part of the data dictionary development process, individual fields can be denot ed as “identifiers”. When exporting a de-
identified dataset, these variables are omitted. Additionally, the data export tool also allows for the shifted of dates for a limited data set export. REDCap provides a secure, web -based application that is flexible enough 
to be used for a variety of types of research, provides an intuitive interface for users to enter data and has real 
time validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of entry. It offers easy data 
manipulation with audit  trails and ad hoc reporting functionality for reporting, monitoring and querying 
patient records, and an automated export mechanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S-Plus). REDCap is 21 CRF Part 11 capable. Currently, REDCap installations support electronic signatures by positively identifying the user through a unique username and password combination. The provisioning of accounts and user access to specific database(s) is integrated with the OSU Medical Center LDAP 
authentication serv ice for studies containing protected health information (PHI), and the provisioning of 
access and specific user rights for all studies are managed by CCTS staff.  
 
Handling missing data - We will prevent missing data through the use of checklists. These checklists will 
ensure that all measures are collected at each assessment session in a consistent order according to study 
protocol. Checklists will also minimize data loss due to technical difficulties (e.g., improper initialization of 
the bilateral activit y monitors , dead batteries, etc.). Automated reminder calls will be sent to participants to 
reduce missed appointments and to remind participants to wear the activity monitors. Missed appointments will be rescheduled immediately. Testing data will be entered into a secure (and backed -up) REDCap 
database within 48 hours of data collection. Reasons for drop- out (and whether drop-out was therapist or 
participant-initiated) will be documented in detail. Loss to follow -up will be minimized by collecting 
multiple  types of contact information and an alternate contact for the participant should he/she be 
unreachable.  
Data Analysis - Missing data from participants who are unable  to complete the protocol (e.g., due to random 
factors unrelated to the study protocol) will be removed from analysis via list -wise deletion. An intent-to -
treat analysis  will be carried out such that data from participants who voluntarily withdraw  from treatment or 
are unable to tolerate the treatment protocol will be included; the mixed effects model planned for analysis is 
purely likelihood-based and can make use of all of the data available with no necessary modifications for differing numbers of subjects at each time point.  Therapy -induced changes in motor ability (primary outcome 
measures of accelerometry and WMFT) will be analyzed via mixed effects linear models .  Initially, separate 
models will be constructed for the two primary outcome measures.  Each of these models will include treatment and time (as well as their interaction) as fixed effects and subject as a random effect.  In these models, the interaction of treatment and time is the primary effect of interest , since it quantifies the 
difference in change over time among the four treatment groups. Statistical testing will be used to d etermine 
whether individuals lost to follow -up differ from those who completed the study.  Demographic measures 
 
 
 13 and initial scores on outcome variables will be compared between groups using t-tests, chi -squared tests, or 
their non- parametric analogues. Significant differences will be considered in interpretation of the results. 
Results will be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.

 15 You will pick a sealed note card from an envelope. When you open the note card, it will tell you 
which study treatment that you will receive. The four possible treatments are:  
 Group 1: Traditional Constraint -Induced Movement Therapy (CIT)  involves 35 hou rs of 
therapy in the clinic within  3 weeks. During these 3 weeks, you will wear a padded mitt on your 
stronger hand .  The purpose of the mitt is to remind you to do daily activities  with your weaker 
hand. You will also complete a number of tasks to help you to carry -over the gains that you 
make in the clinic to daily life . These include practicing motor activities at home (e.g., folding 
laundry) for 30 minutes per day, signing a contract agreeing to wear the padded mitt and to 
practice usin g your weaker  arm, answering a daily questionnaire about your arm use, and 
problem-solving with a therapist to overcome challenges to using your weaker  arm.  
 OR 
 
Group 2: The rehabilitation game with 5 hours therapist contact  involves 15 hours of arm and 
hand therapy over 3 weeks in your own home by playing a video game. The game is easy to 
learn and involves moving your weaker arm  and hand to control your character on the screen. 
No previous experience with video games is needed  to learn the game. The game will also ask 
you how often you use your arm for different daily activities and will help you to problem-solve ways to use your weaker  arm more often . During the three -week period of therapy, you will 
wear  a smart watch  for the  majority  of waking hours.
 The purpose of the watch is to remind you 
to practice daily activities  with the weaker hand by alerting you when your arm is inactive. You 
will also complete a number of tasks to help you to carry -over the gains that you make in the 
clinic  to daily life . These include practicing motor activities at home (e.g., folding laundry) for 
30 minutes per day, signing a contract agreeing to practice everyday activities with  your weaker  
arm, answering a daily questionnaire about your arm use, and problem-solving with your 
therapist to overcome challenges to using your weaker  arm.  You will meet face- to-face with 
your therapist 4 times, for a total of 5 hours. The purpose of these sessions will be to personalize 
the game to you and to teach you to use your weaker arm to perform daily tasks more effectively . On the last day of treatment you will fill out a brief survey regarding your 
experience and future uses of the gaming system. 
 
OR 
 Group 3: The rehabilitation game with 5 hours face- to-face therapist contact and additional 
therapist contact via videoconference. This treatment  is the same as Group 2, but an additional 
2.6 hours of video contact with your therapist is added. The video contact will occur in your home (similar to a Skype call). During these video sessions, your therapist will ask you about your progress and will problem-solve through any challenges to using your weaker arm for daily activities.   
 
OR 
 Group 4: Occupational therapy. You will meet with a therapist 4 times in the clinic for a total of 5 hours over a three-week period. The therapist will do stretching and movement exercises

 16 with you. You will also do exercises at home every day. After 6-month follow-up, you will 
receive the in -home game to play.  
 
Regar dless of which treatment group you are assigned to, you will receive a lot of therapy  
(about 35 hours). You will receive motor and cognitive testing before you begin treatment, after treatment, and after 6 -months. E ach testing session will tak e no longer than 3 hours. Testing  and 
therapy sessions will be video-taped. Testing sessions will involve moving your stronger and 
weaker arms, detecting touch sensation, and answering questions about your  mood, thinking, 
and quality of life. In some cases, some measures may be administered  over the phone. During 
research visits to The Ohio State University Medical Center, you may be asked to perform some 
tests of movement coordination. Finally, you will  be asked to wear activity tracker bands during 
the study period and for two days surrounding each testing period to estimate how frequently 
you move your arms.  
 We will ask for your permission to contact the people with whom you live (or others who know you well). This is routine clinical care that will give us a second opinion as to how you are doing at home and how to personalize the intervention for you. It will also allow us to teach  the 
therapy to people who know you well. We will not obtain information from family, friends, or 
caregivers without your permission and will not share your personal health information with them.  
 
4.   How long will I be in the study?  
If you are in Group 1, you will spend 44 hours of your time over the first 4 weeks of the study.  If 
you are in group 2, you will spend 24 hours of your time over the first 4 weeks of the study.  If 
you are in group 3, you will spend 26 hours of your time over the first 4 weeks of the study.  If you are in Group 4, you will spend 14  hours of your time over the first 4 weeks of the study.  6 
months later, you will participate in a follow-up evaluation to determine how well you have maintained your motor gains over time.  Group 4 will then receive gaming therapy (immediately 
following 6-month testing) for 15 hours and will receive a post-gaming testing session within one 
week after completion of the game.  
 
5.   Can I stop being in the study?  
You may leave the study at any time.  If you decide to stop participating in the study, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  
Your decision will not affect your future relationship with Th e Ohio State University.  
 
6.   What risks, side effects or discomforts can I expect from being in the study?  
Risks of participating in this study are similar to the risks of low impact exercise and other motor 
therapies after stroke. The assessment measures and treatments used are safe & noninvasive. Potential risks include potential fatigue and frustration during therapy and/or testing.  It is 
possible, though unlikely, that you will experience mild stress, anxiety, or emotional distress 
during testing or rehabilitation.

 17 7.   What benefits can I expect from being in the study?  
You might not receive any benefit from participating in this study. You will receive treatment for 
your arm weakness at no cost to you or to your insurance company. We expect that the therapies 
being tested in this study will benefit you, but there is the chance that the form of therapy that you are assigned to may not be effective.   
 
8.   What other choices do I have if I do not take part in the study?  
You may choose not to participate without penalty or loss of benefits. You have the option of 
receiving therapy as part of your clinical care, rather than through this research study. There are 
currently at least two available clinical avenues for receiving CI T: 1) you could receive a more 
spread out form of the therapy at  Morehouse Neurorehabilitation clinic at OSU; 2) you could 
receive the 2 week therapy program (the same training program provided in this study) at the 
Taub Neurorehabilitation clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.    
9.   Will my study -related information be kept confidential?  
Efforts will be made to keep your study-related information confidential.  However, there may be 
times  where this information must be released.  For example, if required by state law.   
 
Also, the following groups may review your records: 
• Office for Human Research Protections or other federal, state, or international regulatory agencies;  
• U.S. Food and Drug Administration; 
• The Institutional Review Board or Office of Responsible Research Practices;  
• The sponsor supporting the study, their agents or study monitors 
 
Given that this study involves a rehabilitation intervention that is related to  your medical care, 
your study-related information may be placed in your permanent hospital, clinic, or physician’s office records. Authorized staff involved in your medical care  may be aware that you are 
participating in a research study and have access t o your information.

 Dear (name),  
 Your [insert care provider service or name here] would like you to be aware of important 
research studies being conducted at The Wexner Medical Center.  Researcher s are 
looking for participants who have experienced a stroke and continue to have trouble us ing 
their weaker side. The enclosed brochure[s]  describe[s] studies that are now enrolling 
participants.  
 If you are interested in participating or learning more about a study, please do one of the two following actions:  
1. Contact us at XXXXXX  for more information.  
2. E-mail us at  XXXXXX@osumc.edu  
 
We would like the opportunity to help you learn more about Stroke rehabilitation research at The Wexner Medical Center.  
 As with all research conducted at the Wexner Medical Center, your participation is voluntary. There will be no consequences to you if you choose not to participate; your 
medical care will not be affected by that choice. If you are eligible and choose to 
participate, the results  of this study  may help us provide better rehabilitation from stroke, 
and benefit individuals with stroke in the future.

I. Active Movement  
 
1. Active Wrist and Finger Extension: 
Starting position: Participant’s forearm on supporting surface (in pronation) with hand hanging over edge of supporting surface allowing full wrist flexion or subject’s available range of motion.   
Participants must be able to actively extend wrist 10
° from the starting position, extend or abduct 
the thumb at least 10 °  from the starting position and extend the metacarpophlangeal and 
interphalangeal joints of at least 2 additional digits 10 °. Picks up a washcloth from table and 
releases it. Must be able to perform each activity at least 3 times in 1 minute. Criteria can be met 
with a device such as Saebo Glove if participant is willing to use this device consistently during the trial.  
 
 30  
• Extension of wrist: 10 ° or more     
• Extension or abduction of thumb: 10 ° or more   
• Extension of MCP and PIP joints at least 2 additional digits: 10° or more  
 
 Does participant meet these criteria ?  Y        N                                   
 
 
2. Active Shoulder Motion 
 
Participant must be able to actively flex and abduct shoulder to at least 45 °. Note: For the purposes 
of this screening, the flexion may be exhibited from a position ranging from that of strict forward 
flexion toward scaption (which, on a horizontal plane, is half way between shoulder flexion and abduction); whereas, abduction may be exhibited from a position ranging from scaption to full abduction at the side of the body.   Starting position: participant seated in chair with a back; UE resting in subject’s lap.   
• Flexion of shoulder: 45 ° or more      
• Abduction of shoulder: 45 ° or more   
 
 Does participant meet these criteria?   Y        N 
 
3. Active Elbow Extension  
 
All Groups – Participant must be able to actively extend at least 20 ° from the 90 °  position. 
Starting position: Participant seated in chair with back; UE supported by tester in 90 ° of shoulder 
flexion (or maximal shoulder flexion possible if PROM is less than 90 °) providing a gravity 
eliminated position for elbow extension and elbow flexed at 90 °. 
 
• Extension of elbow: 20 ° or more from 90 ° flexed position   
 
 Does the participant meet this criterion?  Y        N  
 
 II. Passive ROM:  
 
• Shoulder flexion (90 degrees or more):  
• Shoulder Abduction (90 degrees or more):  
• Shoulder External Rotation (45 degrees or more):  
• Elbow Extension (- 30 degrees contracture or less):

• Adequate communication ability to participate fully  
 
 Does the participant meet this criterion?  Y         N   
 
V. Motor Activity Log 
 This criterion is most useful for identifying which participants with higher motor functioning are eligible to participate.  There is no maximum level of motor ability for the study, but participants 
must exhibit non-use of the weaker arm (score less than 2.5 on the QOM portion of the MAL). When non-use is obvious and motor impairment is pronounced, you need not administer MAL.   
• MAL QOM less than 2.5  
 
 Does the participant meet these criteria?  Y         N  
 
 
VI. Pain 
 
Potential participants will be given the option to self -exclude if they have pain that would be 
significantly aggravated by participation in the protocol. Consider missed days in carrying out everyday tasks due to pain and excessive discomfort.  
 
VII. Anti -Spasticity Agents : 
 Participants receiving Botox injections may be scheduled after 12 weeks from when the Botox injection was administered. If the participant is using other antispasticity  agents such as oral 
Baclofen, then that information will be noted but will not used as inclusion / exclusion criteria.  
• More than 12 weeks from last Botox injection at start of trial  
 
 32  
Are you currently using Baclofen, Dantrium  or any other anti- spasticity agents?   Y         N  
 If so, which one? _____________  If botox, date of last injection? _____________ 
 Does the participant meet these criteria?  Y         N   
 
VIII. Administer 9 -hole peg test  
 If participant qualifies, see whether he/she falls in higher or lower functioning group. Stratification will be based on the participant’s ability to complete placement of any number of pegs on the 9- hole 
peg test within the allotted time  (120 seconds). 
 Higher group: can place ANY number of pegs (1 -9) 
Lower group: cannot place any pegs  
 Which group is the participant assigned to?  ____________

 37 Description of Therapy  
 
Constraint Induced Movement Therapy or CI therapy is thought to work because it has been shown to 
produce a large "rewiring" of the brain; that is, after treatment, a larger part of the brain is involved in producing movement of the weaker arm than before therapy.  It also has the effect of overcoming a strong tendency not to use the weaker arm (“learned nonuse”) that develops in the early post- stroke 
period.  Research has shown that patients can "learn" to improve the motor ability of the weaker parts of their bodies and thus cease to rely exclusively or primarily on the stronger parts. For this learning and rewiring to occur, two things have to happen:  
1. Intensive training of the weaker arm in the clinic. This will occur through intensive training of 
the weaker arm and hand in the laboratory for 3 hours a day for 10 days.   
2. Use of the weaker arm for daily activities (more than the stronger arm) OUTSIDE the  clinic. 
This is linked to structural changes in the brain and improved quality of life. Research has shown that these improvements are absent when improved motor function does not carry over to daily life. Three things will help you carry -over in-lab improvements to your daily 
activities.  
a.  Restraint of the stronger arm in a padded mitt  for a large number of waking hours 
over the treatment period in the laboratory and at home.   
b. The procedures involved in use of the mitt will be outlined in a Treatment Contract  
established by you and the therapist at the beginning of treatment.   This contract is used to identify specific daily tasks that your weaker arm will perform and times when the mitt will be worn.  Safety is always the first consideration when determining the appropriate times for use of the weaker arm and the use of the mitt on the stronger arm.  For example, if you require the use of a quad cane for safe walking, then the mitt would be removed when walking to ensure maximal safety when the quad cane is used. As part of this contract, you will be asked to complete a Home Achievement Record  that focuses on the use of the weaker arm in your home and on the use of the 
mitt outside the laboratory.   
c. A home practice program  (30 minutes daily) will be devise d for you to carry out 
with your weaker arm when you are out of the clinic. 
 Obtaining the Best Results   
 You must be willing to work diligently during your treatment program. If portions of the therapy are dropped, the treatment has been found to be much less effective. Also, it would be harder for us to show definitive results from this study when people deviate from the study protocol (similar to studying the relative effectiveness of different medicines when they are not taken as prescribed). If you are having difficulty keeping up with the protocol, please let your project therapist know.  A solution can be worked out to help you achieve the most from the therapy and minimize deviations from the prescribed therapy.  
 
 
 
 38 Treatment Contract  
 
I agree to the following treatment expectations:  
• I will attempt to use only  my weaker arm for nearly all activities outside the clinic 
(listed in the Home Achievement Record form), including social situations.  I will attempt to use my weaker arm alone in all these activities, even if I had previously 
been using only my stronger arm for some of those tasks.  
 
• The only times that I will involve my stronger arm in my daily activities are if my safety could in any way be affected or for two- handed tasks.  
 
 Activities for whic h I can remove my mitt:  
_______________________________________________________ 
 
• I will wear the mitt on my stronger arm for a target 10 hours/day to break the habit of relying too much on my stronger arm for daily activities.  
 
• I will not remove the mitt at any time or for any task for which I have agreed to wear it, EXCEPT under 3 conditions: 1) if it could negatively affect my safety, 2) for two-handed tasks, and 3) for tasks involving water.  
 
• If I need to reschedule a therapy session, I will call as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours in advance.  I will plan to arrive on time to all therapy sessions.  
 
• I will practice 10 activities of importance to me with my weaker hand for a total of 30 minutes per treatment day (Home Skill Assignment).

 39 Caregiver Contract  
         
I agree to assist with providing CI therapy in the following ways:  
 
- I will allow my family member to take ownership and responsibility for the treatment.  
 
- I will assist with a task by serving as a “second arm” to enable my family member to 
avoid using the stronger arm during the treatment period for certain tasks discussed in 
the Home Achievement Record.  
 
- I will relinquish my "caregiver hat" and will not perform any activities that my family 
member has agreed to accomplish with the weaker hand, even when my family member appears to be struggling.  
 
- I will only assist with upper extremity tasks if safety is a concern or if my assistance will 
provide additional opportunities for my family member to use the weaker arm (e.g., 
serving as a "second arm"). When assistance with a task is required I will al low my 
family member to solve the problem using the "Say," "do," "check" approach:  
• Say: What else could you try?  
• Do: Let your family member try the solution, even if you don’t think it will work.  
• Check: What worked? How can the plan be revised for better success? 
 
- I may provide reminders for my family member to engage in therapy tasks if he or she has indicated that they would be helpful (e.g., reminders to do Home Skill 
Assignments). 
 
- I understand that the treatment will be extremely challenging and I will be supportive 
and encouraging.  
 
- I will praise my family member's effort at using the weaker hand, especially during tasks that are difficult . 
 
- I will be open to simple adaptat ions in the home if they enable my family member to use 
their weaker arm more f requently (such as using plastic dishware temporarily) . 
 
- I understand that using the weaker arm may result in more spills and that this is a 
necessary step toward improving function of the weaker arm.  I will be supportive when 
this happens.  
 
- I agree to attend therapy sessions when possible.

 63 Description of Therapy  
 
What is CI Therapy? 
Constraint Induced Movement Therapy or CI therapy is thought to work because it has been shown to 
produce a large "rewiring" of the brain; that is, after treatment, a larger part of the b rain is involved in 
producing movement of the weaker arm than before therapy.  It also has the effect of overcoming a strong tendency not to use the weaker arm (“learned nonuse”) that develops in the early post- stroke 
period.  Research has shown that patients can "learn" to improve the motor ability of the weaker parts of their 
bodies and thus cease to rely exclusively or primarily on the stronger parts. For this learning and 
rewiring to occur, two things have to happen:  
1. Intensive training of the weaker arm. This will occur through playing the Recovery Rapids 
video game in your home for 1.5 hours per day for 10 days.   
2. Use of the weaker arm for daily activities (more than the stronger arm) OUTSIDE the clinic. This is linked to structural changes in the brain and improved quality of life. Research has shown that these improvements are absent when improved motor function does not carry over to daily life. Three things will help you carry -over in-lab improvements to your daily activities 
(i.e., change your habit of always using the stronger arm). 
a. A smart watch that will record your activity with the weaker arm. The goal will be to dramatically increase the number of arm movements made with your weaker arm over the course of the intervention.   
b. A Treatment Contract  that will identify specific daily tasks that your weaker arm 
will perform each day.  Safety is always the first consideration when determining the appropriate times for use of the weaker arm (e.g., you may not want to use a cane in the weaker hand ). As part of this contract, you will be asked to complete a Home 
Achievement Record  each day to check your progress with building new habits of 
using the weaker arm in your home. 
c. A home practice program  (30 minutes daily) will be devised for you to carry out 
with your weaker arm when you are out of the clinic. 
 Obtaining the Best Results
  
You must be willing to work diligently during your treatment program. If portions of the therapy are dropped, the treatment has been found to be much less effective. Also, it would be harder for us to show definitive results from this study when people deviate from the study protocol (similar to studying the relative effectiveness of different medicines when they are not taken as prescribed). If you are having difficulty keeping up with the protocol, please let your project therapist know.  A solution can be worked out to help you achieve the most from the therapy while minimizing 
deviations from the prescribed program.  
  
 
 64 Treatment Contract  
 
I agree to the following treatm ent expectations: 
• I will use only  my weaker arm for nearly all activities outside the clinic (listed in the Home 
Achievement Record form), including social situations.  I will attempt to use my weaker arm alone in all these activities, even if I had previo usly been using only my stronger arm for some 
of those tasks.  
 
• The only times that I will involve my stronger arm in my daily activities are if my safety could in any way be affected or for two-handed tasks. 
  
Activities for which I should use my stronger arm:  
___________________________________________________________ 
 
• I will wear the smart watch on my weaker arm for a target 10 hours/day to break the habit of relying too much on my stronger arm for daily activities. I will record the number of movements made by my weaker arm each night with the goal of exceeding the num ber of 
movements typically made with my stronger arm.   • If I need to reschedule a therapy session, I will call as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours in advance. I will plan to arrive on time to all therapy sessions. 
 
• I will practice 10 activities of importance to me with my weaker hand for a total of 30 minutes per treatment day (Home Skill Assignment).  
 
Goals for Treatment (what I'm working towards):  
 
1. __________________________________________________________________________  2. __________________________________________________________________________  3. __________________________________________________________________________    
                                                                                 ________________________              ___________________________ Signature of Patient     Signature of Therapist  
 
  
 
 65 Caregiver Contract  
         
I agree to assist with providing CI therapy in the following ways:  
 
- I will allow my family member to take ownership and responsibility for the treatment.  
 
- I will assist with a task by serving as a “second arm” to enable my family member to 
avoid using the stronger arm during the treatment period for certain tasks discussed in 
the Home Achievement Record.  
 
- I will relinquish my "caregiver hat" and will not perform any activities that my family 
member has agreed to accomplish with the weaker hand, even when my family member appears to be struggling.  
 
- I will only assist with upper extremity tasks if safety is a concern or if my assistance will 
provide additional opportunities for my family member to use the weaker arm (e.g., 
serving as a "second arm"). When assistance with a task is required I will allow my family member to so lve the problem using the "Say," "do," "check" approach:  
• Say: What else could you try?  
• Do: Let your family member try the solution, even if you don’t think it will work.  
• Check: What worked? How can the plan be revised for better success? 
 
- I may provide reminders for my family member to engage in therapy tasks if he or she has indicated that they would be helpful (e.g., reminders to do Home Skill 
Assignments). 
 
- I understand that the treatment will be extremely challenging and I will be supportive 
and encouraging.  
 
- I will praise my family member's effort at using the weaker hand, especially during tasks 
that are difficult . 
 
- I will be open to simple adaptat ions in the home if they enable my family member to use 
their weaker arm more frequently (such as using plastic dishware temporarily) . 
 
- I understand that using the weaker arm may result in more spills and that this is a 
necessary step toward improving function of the weaker arm.  I will be supportive when 
this happens.  
 
- I agree to attend therapy sessions when possible.

To help us obtain the most meaningful study results, we would greatly appreciate your efforts to reschedule missed appointments or game play time. This will ensure that all study groups get the same amount of total motor practice. Your participation will help us learn whether an in-home therapy can lead to gains in motor functioning that are as lar ge as with more costly in -clinic 
therapies. We really appreciate your contribution to science!

Traditional Rehabilitation Protocol 
 
Guiding Principles:  
● Participants will receive the intervention on 4 visits that total 5 hours of participant/therapist contact. 
The 4 visits will be dispersed across the 3 weeks as evenly as possible. Ideally, the first  2 visits will 
occur during week 1 and the second 2 visits will be administered on weeks 2 and 3.  
● The intervention will incorporate activities that are typically used in clinical settings for rehabilitation.  
● The activities are designed to meet the specific  needs of the participant (e.g., work to improve their 
body structure challenges, activity limitations, and participation goals).  
● The protocol is standardized regarding activity categories, activity selection, activity intensity target 
level, and progression principles yet will be tailored to the participants’ specific needs and goals.  
● The amount of time dedicated to each activity category is specified below. It is expected that several trials of a given activity category may be accomplished during this time frame and it is expected that 
the number of trials may vary between participants  based on their movement and endurance 
capabilities. 
 
● For the active procedures of neuromuscular re-education, functional training, and progressive 
strengthening, the target for exercise intensity is 4 (somewhat hard) on the Borg CR10 Rating of 
Perceived E xertion Scale. Therapists should also assure that activities are conducted with high 
quality.  
● When designing a clinical activity, therapists will select from a list of activities and grade the difficulty 
of the activity so that the participant is working a t a level 4 on the Borg CR10 Rating of Exertion Scale. 
In subsequent visits, therapists should adjust the activity grade (up or down) to achieve that same level 4 of the Borg CR10 Scale.
 
● A home program will be designed for all participants on the first vis it. This home program will consist 
of theraband strengthening exercises to be done over a 15 minute time period twice daily (total of 
30 minutes each day) except on the days that they come into the laboratory for treatment. Therapists will design this program based on the participant’s skill with the exercises and the appropriate level 
of exertion (4 on the Borg CR10 Scale). Therapists will provide written instructions on these exercise 
and will review and modify the exercise program, as appropriate, on sub sequent clinic visits (i.e., 
visits 2-4). 
 
Allocation of treatment time – The first treatment session will be 2 hours in length and subsequent 
treatment sessions will each be 1 hour in length.

Clinical Activity Description: Neuromuscular re- education (20 minutes TD1; 10 minutes TD2 -4) 
Description: ICD definition: (ICD 97112)Neuromuscular re -education of movement, balance, coordination, 
kinesthetic sense, posture, and/or proprioception for sitting and/or standing activities Examples include: 
Biofeedback, PNF, manual facilitation, sensory priming.  
 
These activities will be used to “prime” the motor responses and promote more coordinated and 
appropriate muscle responses during the functional training to follow.  
 
Clinical Activity Description: Functional Training (25 minutes all treatment days)  
Description: Functional training will focus around 4 categories of activities that have high relevance for 
functional use of the upper extremity (dexterity, interpersonal reaching, extrapersonal reaching, and overhead reaching). Each category of activities will be carried out for approximately 5 minutes, allowing another 5 
minutes for switching between task categories. Participants will be seated for all activities and patients encouraged to keep their trunk against the back of the chair to promote proper posture. Assistive devices such 
as orthoses, taping or bandages can be used. Rest periods can be provided as much as needed. 
 
1. Dexterity – Participants will use the more-affected hand to engage in various manipulation tasks for 
approximately 5 minutes of the functional training period during each of the treatment days. The 
specific manipulation task selected for that day will correspond with manipulation task in need of 
improvement for and preferred by that participant. The  task should also be moderately challenging for 
that individual and leads to physical exertion rating of a 4 on the Borg CR10 Scale.  
Examples: picking up small objects (e.g., coins, paper clips, checkers) off of a table, buttoning a shirt, 
flipping playin g cards.  
 
2. Inter -personal Space Reaching – Participants will use the more -affected arm to engage in reaching and 
 
 81 manipulation tasks relatively close to their body (e.g., requiring less than 45 degrees of shoulder 
flexion).  These tasks will be less likely to involve a great deal of trunk rotation and/or reaching across 
midline. 
Examples: using a spoon to move beans from one bowl to another, moving a belt through belt loops, 
moving ping pong balls from one container to another.  
3. Extra -personal Space Reaching  – Participants will use the more-affected arm to engage in reaching 
and manipulation tasks relatively far away from their body (e.g., requiring between 45 and 90 degrees 
of shoulder flexion and approaching full extension of the elbow).  These tasks will be  more likely to 
involve trunk rotation and reaching across midline.  
Examples: wiping off a counter, setting a table with eating utensils.  
Overhead Reaching  - Participants will use the more -affected arm to engage in reaching tasks toward 
a target that is held by a therapist and placed overhead (e.g., requiring greater than  90 degrees 
shoulder flexion and approaching full extension of the elbow).   
Examples: combing hair with a brush, blow drying hair, putting a hat on/off, placing objects on a 
high shelf.  
 Clinical Activity Description: Progressive Strengthening Activities (25 minutes TD1; 15 minutes TD 2 -
4) 
Description: Strengthening should emphasize shoulder flexion, Shoulder Abduction (with elbow extension or 90
o of flexion), Shoulder Extension (with elbow extension or 90o of flexion), and Shoulder External Rotation 
(90o elbow flexion). Each movement will be carried out according to the description taken fr om the GRASP 
exercise program with no theraband or with the color of theraband providing the level of resistance corresponding to a level 4 on the Borg CR10 Scale and that allows good quality of movement. During the 
session, therapists will select a number  of repetitions that correspond to moderate exertion (rating of 4 on the 
CR10 exertion scale) and will assign that number of repetitions for the home exercise program to be carried 
out until the next visit. The number of repetitions will be progressed as appropriate for that patient and corresponding with strength gains while maintaining Borg level 4 and completing the program in 30 minutes.

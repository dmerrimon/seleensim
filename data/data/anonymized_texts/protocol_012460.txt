Study Centers Planned  Multi -center  
Study Design  This is a multi- center, single arm, non- randomized, open- label study of  
64Cu-labelled SAR -bisPSMA (64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA ) administered to 
participants with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (PC) 
following definitive therapy. Participants who provide informed consent 
will undertake a screening visit(s) to determine their eligibility to 
participate in the study. The maximum Screening period for each 
participant is 28 days. After the Screening period, eligible participants will 
receive a single administration of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA on Day 0, followed 
by a positron emission tomography ( PET) /computed tomography ( CT) 
scan at 1 to 4 hours post dose (Day 0 scan) and at 24 hours post dose (Day 
1 scan). Safety of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA will be assessed post dose, on Day 
0, Day 1 and Day 7. Participants w ill then continue into the Follow -Up 
period to verify the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT findings by 
histopathology, conventional imaging modalities that are routinely used in the diagnosis and staging of PC and prostate -specific antigen ( PSA) levels. 
The maximum Follow -up period for each participant is 180 days.  
The 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scans will be interpreted by an 
appropriately qualified local Investigator and three independent, blinded, 
central readers.  
The 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT findings will be assessed against a 
composite Reference Standard. The composite Reference Standard will be 
determined by an independent, blinded, central expert panel and may 
consist of histopathology, conventional imaging modalities that are 
routinely used in the diagnosis and staging of PC  and PSA levels.

This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
applicable regulatory requirements, and International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines. 
2.1 Background  
Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most frequent malignancy in men1. The American Cancer 
Society estimates 248,530 new cases of PC were diagnosed in the United States of America 
(USA) in 2021 accounting for approximately 25% of all new estimated cancer cases in men and approximately 13% of all new estimated cancer cases
1,2. Incidence correlates with age, 
running between 30% for patients 40- 50 years old to 50- 80% for patients aged 80 and over3. 
Median age at diagnosis is 67 years and median age at death is 81 years4,5. Although t he 
etiology of the disease is unclear , the main risk factors include advanced age, ethnicity, and 
positive family history6. While some patients with PC have indolent disease, where the 
patient’s serum prostate -specific antigen (PSA) values are followed without further treatment, 
the majority of patients will receive some treatment for their PC. Between 20 -40% of patients 
with PC will relapse within 10 years of their primary PC treatment, as identified through rising 
PSA levels. At relapse, approximately 25- 35% of patients have locally recurrent disease, 20-
25% have metastatic disease, and 45 -55% have both local and metastatic disease7. 
Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is a type II, 750- amino acid transmembrane 
protein (100- 120 kDa), anchored in the cell membrane of prostate epithelial cells. P rostate 
Specific Membrane Antigen has two important enzymatic functions; folate hydrolase and N -
acetylated -a-linked acidic dipeptidase, and exhibits an endocytic function, in which it 
spontaneously recycles through endocytic vesicles. Despite its name, PSMA is not specific to the prostate gland and is expressed in other tissues, including sa livary  and lacrimal  glands, 
duodenal mucosa, proximal renal tubular cells, and subpopulations of neuroendocrine cells in 
the colonic crypts
8. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen is strongly upregulated in all types of 
PC, and increases with tumor aggressiveness, metastatic disease, and recurrence,  making it an 
excellent target for both imaging and therapy of PC9-11. 
The Sponsor  is developing a radiolabeled inhibitor of PSMA for the diagnosis and treatment 
of PC. The product is copper -labeled bisCOSAR -(Lys-urea-Glu) 2 (Cu-SAR -bisPSMA). Cu-
SAR -bisPSMA uses a radioactive form (radionuclide) of copper, 64Cu to image cancers using 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and then 67Cu for therapy by internal beta -radiation.  
The target population for this study is patients with biochemical recurrence of PC  following 
initial definitive therapy. Although PSA is the primary biomarker for recurrence, it does not 
reflect the location or the extent of disease recurrence. Despite recent advances in imaging 
techniques, many patients will fail to have their recurren ce accurately localized by imaging, 
especially at low PSA levels. Identifying tumor relapses and metastases is challenging for 
conventional imaging modalities such as Compute d Tomography (CT) and Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) due to limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Early diagnosis of 
recurrence and accurate staging are essential to inform the best treatment strategy. P rostate 
Specific Membrane Antigen- targeting agents have been shown to be well suited for the 
development of radiopharmaceuticals for imaging and therapy of PC . Evolving evidence 
demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity of these  PET agents  compared to conventional 
imaging, with frequent identification of sub- centimeter PC lesions. P rostate Specific 
Membrane Antigen -targeting PET scan is effective for imaging disease in the prostate, lymph 
nodes, soft tissue, and bone in a single examination12.

bisPSMA  (64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA ). 
2.2 Imaging of Prostate Cancer  
Conventional imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, and 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate 
(99mTc-MDP) bone scan, suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, which can result in 
inaccurate disease staging leading to suboptimal treatment. The use of molecular imaging using 
PET has therefore been explored to better identify sites of disease. A number of new PET 
diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals have emerged in the recent years, including agents that accumulate on the basis of alterations in cellular metabolism as well as those that bind to specific proteins, such as PSMA
13.  
Approved diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals that are commonly used to image PC include 99mTc-
MDP bone scan, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), 18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF), 11C-
choline, 18F-FACBC (or 18F-fluciclovine; registered as Axumin®), and more recently, PSMA -
based PET radiopharmaceuticals, 68Ga-PSMA -11 and 18F-DCFPyL (registered as 
PYLARIFY®)13,14.  
Currently, 99mTc-MDP planar whole -body scanning is the imaging standard for detection of 
osseous metastases. 18F-Sodium Fluoride uptake mechanism in the bone is similar to that for 
99mTc-MDP but with better sensitivity and specificity in the detection of bone metastases. 
These scans are both lacking in specificity however, with uptake in areas of bone remodeling such as infection and trauma, in addition to osseous metastases. Furthermor e, they are limited 
in the detection of soft -tissue malignancies, including the primar y tumor, lymph node disease, 
and visceral metastases.  
Although molecular imaging in oncology is most commonly performed with 
18F-FDG PET, 
this test has not shown clinical utility in PC imaging15. Prostate cancer  cells typically do not 
undergo increased aerobic glycolysis, limiting the use of 18F-FDG. These cells do, however, 
display upregulated de novo lipid synthesis and activity of lipogenic enzymes. This enables 
lipid precursors such as choline to function as radiotracers for PET imaging in PC. 11C-choline 
was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012, but choline -based 
radiotracers are not cancer specific, and can be taken up in other tissues or areas of benign 
inflammation. I n addition, its use is affected by the short half -life (t 1/2=20 minutes). In studies 
comparing 11C-choline to 68Ga-PSMA -11, 68Ga-PSMA -11 showed a higher detection rate than 
11C-choline PET for lymph nodes as well as bone lesions16,17. 18F-FACBC targets multiple 
sodium -dependent and independent channels which are upregulated in PC . 18F-FACBC is a 
synthetic amino acid that is well tolerated and able to detect local and distant PC recurrences 
across a wide range of PSA values18. However, like 11C-choline, 18F-FACBC was shown to be 
inferior to 68Ga-PSMA -11 in prospective imaging trials19.  
Prostate S pecific M embrane A ntigen  has been studied extensively as an imaging target in PC. 
The first commercialized PSMA targeting imaging agent was 111In-labelled -capromab -
pendetide (ProstaScint ®), which was approved by the FDA in 1996. However, ProstaScint ® 
was only able to bind to the intracellular epitope of PSMA and was therefore not capable of visualizing viable PC cells leading to poor clinical performance
20. Since then, the class of 
PSMA targeting agents that have been most extensively explored are the urea -based small 
molecule inhibitors of PSMA. Two of these, 68Ga-PSMA -11 and 18F-DCFPyL, have recently 
been approved by the FDA for PET imaging of PSMA positive lesions in men with PC with 
suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy or with suspected 
recurrence based on elevated serum PSA level. The updated National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network Guidelines ® for PC  (Version 1.2022)  specify that 68Ga-PSMA -11 and 18F-DCFPyL 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 21 of 70 or PET/CT can be considered as an alternative to standard imaging of bone and soft tissue for 
initial staging, the detection of biochemically recurrent disease, and as workup for progression with bone scan plus CT or MRI for the evaluation of bone, pelvis, and abdomen. Several other 
68Ga- and 18F-based PSMA targeting products are currently in development21.  
Due to the short half -life of 68Ga and 18F-based PSMA products, PET is usually conducted 
around 1 hour post administration . However, most PC lesions present with increased uptake 
and contrast at later imaging timepoints22. Thus, 64Cu with its  longer half -life (t 1/2=12.7 hours) 
compared to 68Ga (t 1/2=68 minutes) and 18F (t 1/2=109.7 minutes) has the potential to provide 
advantages over the 68Ga- and 18F-based PET products. Delayed imaging may enable the 
detection of additional or smaller lesions, due to enhanced tumor -to-background ratios 
following biological clearance of the product over time23. A longer half -life also allows for 
large- scale central manufacturing and offers logistical advantages in the manufacture and 
delivery of a finished product to the clinical site, providing superior geographical coverage 
compared to 68Ga and 18F-based  products. Thus, 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT has the potential  
to be a useful diagnostic tool to localize PC , including in patients with suspected biochemical 
recurrence of PC with low PSA, where there is a high unmet medical need.  
2.3 Preclinical Experience 
A number of non- clinical studies have been conducted to assess the biodistribution, in vivo 
safety and tolerability , as well as tumor imaging and efficacy of SAR -bisPSMA labeled with 
either natural stable Cu (natCu), 64Cu or 67Cu. 
Preclinical imaging studies with 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA in a PC xenograft model showed high 
uptake and retention of the product in the tumor over 24 hours (22% I njected A ctivity [IA]/g at 
1 hour and 26% IA/g at 24 hours post dose )24. These results compare favorably to other PSMA -
targeted products in similar preclinical models.  
A repeat dose toxicology study in mice was conducted to investigate the potential toxicity of 
natCu-labeled SAR -bisPSMA when administered weekly for four administrations by 
intravenous injection. No clinical abnormalities, significant changes in weight or feed intake, and no product related effects were observed in hematology, blood biochemistry and urine analyses. There were no product related macroscopic, nor microscopic findings in organs by 
histology analysis. The no observed adverse effect level was considered to be 2 mg/kg for 
natCu-SAR -bisPSMA , which corresponds to a safety factor of the chemical entity of the 
product, of 192 times the proposed dose.  
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA and 67Cu-SAR -bisPSMA form a true theranostic pair, meaning the 
products behave the same biologically, as they both utilize isotopes of copper, for diagnosis and therapy, respectively. Biodistribution studies using either 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA or 67Cu-
SAR -bisPSMA are therefore applicable to both products. The biodistribution of 67Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA was investigated in healthy male mice. 67Cu-SAR -bisPSMA was utilized to allow 
measurements of the biological clearance of Cu -SAR -bisPSMA out to nine days after injection, 
due to the longer half -life of 67Cu (t 1/2= 2.6 days). Effective blood clearance of 67Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA was demonstrated in male mice at one hour (0.7 ± 0.2% IA/g) and at 24 hours, 
activity circulation in the blood had reduced by over 85% of the one hour values. The primary 
excretion pathway for 67Cu-SAR -bisPSMA is via the kidneys into urine. However, the high 
expression of PSMA in murine kidneys resulted in high initial kidney uptake, with the highest 
accumulated activity at 2 hours in male mice ( 184.1 ± 12.3% IA/g). Over 95% of the 67Cu 
SAR -bisPSMA activity in the kidneys had been cleared at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and 
intestines suggests there is also some hepatobiliary clearance of 67Cu-SAR -bisPSMA. The 
salivary glands, a PSMA expressing organ, exhibited peak activity at 2 hours however 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 22 of 70 clearance from the salivary glands was rapid with approximately 90% of the activity cleared at 
24 hours.  
Dosimetry calculations from the mouse biodistribution study enabled organ radiation dose 
extrapolations for an adult human male. For 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA, the largest radiation dose is 
observed in the kidney and urinary bladder, with a value of 0.258 mGy/MBq and 
0.059 mGy/MBq, respectively.  The effective whole- body dose was 0.012 mSv/MBq, which 
for an administration of 200 MBq of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA would result in an effective whole -
body dose of 2.43 mSv. 
Please refer to the IB for further details on non -clinical studies.  
2.4 Clinical Experience  
The Sponsor is currently conducting two clinical trials using 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA:  
• The CLP05 (“Secure”) clinical trial: Phase I/IIa theranostic study of 64Cu-SAR-
bisPSMA and 67Cu-SAR- bisPSMA for identification and treatment of PSMA -expressing 
metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This study is currently 
recruiting participants with metastatic castrate resistant PC  at a number of clinical sites 
in the USA. In this study, 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA is used as a diagnostic agent to select 
patients eligible for therapy with 67Cu-SAR -bisPSMA; with the objective of assessing 
safety , dosimetry, biodistribution and the ability of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT to 
visualize  PC, as well as determine the safety and therapeutic efficacy of 67Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA .  
• The CLP03  (“Propeller”) clinical trial:  Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of 
Participants with Confirmed Prostate Cancer Using 64Cu-SAR- bisPSMA: A Multi -
Centre, Blinded review, Dose Ranging Phase I study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This study is 
currently recruiting participants at a number of clinical sites in Australia. This is a Phase 1 safety and dose ranging study of 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA administered to participants 
with untreated, histopathology confirmed PC, with intermediate - to high- risk features, 
who are planned for radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection. The aim of the study is to assess the safety, image quality and ability of 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA  PET/CT  
to detect PC.  
Based on the preliminary data accrued to date, no significant safety findings have emerged in relation to 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA.  
2.5 Rationale for the Study and Study Design  
The non- clinical data indicate that 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA binds to PSMA -expressing tumors 
with high affinity, appears to be well -tolerated and has a  potential to be used to obtain high 
quality images of PSMA -expressing tumors in human cancers. These findings warrant further 
investigations in clinical studies.  
This is a multi- center, single arm, non- randomized, open- label study of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA 
administered to participants with biochemical recurrence of PC following definitive therapy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy  of 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA . The collection of standard safety parameters used in this study such as 
adverse event (AE) reporting, vital signs, electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), and clinical laboratory 
assessments are considered appropriate for monitoring the health and well -being of participants 
in early phase clinical studies. The biodistribution assessments were selected to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA in humans. The diagnostic efficacy assessments

Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 23 of 70 used in this study are widely used and considered appropriate for the evaluation of performance 
of diagnostic imaging agents.  
This study will provide the Sponsor with information on the safety, pharmacokinetics and 
preliminary diagnostic efficacy  of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA in the target population, prior to 
initiating more extensive Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.  
2.5.1 Imaging Timepoint Selection  
The 64Cu diagnostic radionuclide has a half -life of 12.7 hours which allows for the completion 
of PET scans up to at least 24 hours post administration of the radiopharmaceutical .  
Preclinical PET/CT images captured at 1, 4 and 24 hours post administration of 64Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA showed that the tumor is clearly visible at the 1 hour timepoint. The tumor -to-
background ratio at 4 and 24 hours was much higher than at 1 hour , demonstrating a high 
degree of accumulation and retention.  
For this study, a PET/CT scan completed between 1 and 4 hours post  dose of 64Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA (Day 0 scan) is  considered to be clinically practical and suitable to assess whether 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA is capable of detecting PC in humans. Delayed imaging at 24 hours post  
dose (Day 1 scan) will also be completed  as it is hypothesized that delayed imaging may enable 
the detection of smaller lesions due to enhanced tumor -to-background ratios following 
biological clearance of the product over time. 
2.5.2 Dose Selection of 64Cu-SAR- bisPSMA  
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA  will be administered at a fixed administered activity of 200 MBq.  
Preclinical biodistribution studies were used to extrapolate the estimated organ radiation 
dosimetry of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA in adult males. These calculations indicate that an 
administration of 200 MBq of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA would result in an effective whole -body 
dose of 2.43 mSv (0.012 mSv/MBq). An effective dose of this magnitude is comparable to other routinely used imaging agents such as 
18F-FDG (8.4 mSv according to the Nuclear 
Medicine Radiation Dose Tool - SNMMI ), and the recently approved 68Ga-PSMA -11 and 18F-
DCFPyL at their recommended administered activity ( 4.4 mSv and 3.9 mSv, respectively, 
according to approved labeling).  The preclinical biodistribution study projected that the kidney 
was the organ with the highest absorbed dose. A  200 MBq administered activity of 64Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA will limit the estimated radiation  absorbed dose to the kidney to approximately 
50 mGy.  
Based on the data obtained to date  in the CLP03 and CLP05 study, the Sponsor believes that 
200 MBq of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA is an adequate activity to guarantee sufficient image quality 
for this study across the selected imaging timepoints. 
2.6 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
It is not known if study participants will gain any improvement in their own healthcare 
outcomes as a result of their participation in this study. However, the ability to accurately identify  and stage PC recurrence would enable more effective  treatment  decisions and this 
would therefore, be considered  a benefit to the participant . A general societal benefit is widely 
considered to accrue from medical scientific knowledge accumulated through the conduct of ethical research on participants . 
All study participants will receive a single administration of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA. Specific 
foreseeable risks to study participants include:

Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 24 of 70 • Radiation dose received by the study participant:  Extrapolation of preclinical 
biodistribution studies estimate that an administration of 200 MBq of 64Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA would result in an effective whole -body dose of 2.43 mSv (i.e. 
0.012 mSv/MBq), which is comparable to the whole -body effective doses of other 
routinely used imaging agents at their recommended administered activity. There is a 
potential hazard from the additional radiation burden to study participants. The study also involves low dose CT scan(s) performed for attenuation correction of the PET  
scan(s) and for the anatomical correlation to allow more precise delineation of organs. 
Participants without baseline anatomical imaging  will undergo a diagnostic quality CT  
(instead of the low dose CT) as part of the Day 0 PET/CT scan.  
• C
hemical toxicity of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA and other constituents of the injection:  The 
constituents (including excipients and stabilizers ) of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA are at 
concentrations that are known to be safe for human use. 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA , as 
supplied, will result in a maximum quantity not exceeding 50 μg of peptide mass per participant for an administration. The administered peptide mass is therefore at least 192 times less than the dose of 
natCu-SAR -bisPSMA that has been demonstrated to be 
without any relevant toxicity in rodent toxicology studies (based on a 60 kg subject). The administered dose is well below the limits specified by the FDA for microdosing studies. 
• I
ntravenous administration:  Minor pain may occur at the time of venipuncture and 
minor bruising may also result; however, patients are exposed to these same risks during routine care. Whilst extravasation of PET radiopharmaceuticals is possible, it is unlikely associated with adverse outcomes due to the very small mass of material s 
contained in the injection, and the small amount of radioactivity available for injection. Nevertheless, an indwelling canula can be established prior to investigational product administration to mitigate this risk . 
• I
ncidental findings of possible clinical significance:  Appropriate diagnostic testing can 
assist in making a correct diagnosis and in providing additional information to guide patient management. An incorrect diagnosis (e.g. false negative or false positive results of the diagnostic tests) can have important consequences in patient management. An incidental finding is an imaging finding of potential health importance concerning the study participant, which is discovered while conducting imaging research, but is beyond the aims of the study. It is the responsibility of the local site or of the study Investigator to arrange for routine clinical review of study scans and clinical follow -up, 
as required. Policies for the communication of the incidental finding to the research participant should align with national regulations and customs. As part of the informed consent process, research participants will be informed about the possibility that incidental imaging findings may be detected, and about the pathway for handling such findings.

3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Study Overview  
Approximately 50 participants are planned to be enrolled in this study. This is a multi- center, 
single arm, non- randomized, open- label study of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA administered to 
participants with biochemical recurrence of PC  following definitive therapy. To be considered 
for inclusion in the study, candidates must demonstrate negative or equivocal findings on 
institutional standard of care (SOC) conventional imaging.  
Participants who provide informed consent will undertake screening visit (s) to determine their 
eligibility to participate in the study. The maximum Screening period for each participant is 28 
days. After the Screening period, eligible participants will receive a single administration of 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA on Day 0, followed by a PET/CT scan at 1 to 4 hours post dose (Day 0 
scan)  and at 24 hours post dose (Day 1 scan) . Safety of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA will be assessed 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 28 of 70 post dose  on Day 0, Day 1 and Day 7 . Participants will then continue into the  maximum 180-
day Follow -Up period  to verify the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT findings  by:  
• Follow -up conventional imaging:  All participants will undergo conventional imaging 
at 90 days ± 15 days post Day 0.  
o Participants who are deemed to be negative or equivocal for PC recurrence 
based on central review of the 90- day conventional imaging will undergo 
further conventional imaging at 180 days ± 15 days post Day 0.  
o Participants who are deemed positive for PC recurrence  based on central review 
of the 90- day conventional imaging will require no further study visits . 
However, if additional follow -up imaging per Investigator discretion is acquired 
within 180 days post Day 0, these data must be provided to the central reading 
center .  
• Histopathology:  Where feasible, obtaining histopathology from biopsy or surgery 
should be attempted for as many 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive lesions as possible  
(based on the local interpretation of the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scans)  within 180 
days of Day 0. If clinically feasible, the Investigator should make every effort to obtain 
histopathology for at least one 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive lesion per region . 
• Assessment of PSA levels : PSA will be assessed in all participants at 90  days ± 15 
days and if the participant is returning to the study site for further follow -up imaging,  
at 180 days  ± 15 days  post Day 0. If radiation therapy or other salvage focal therapy  
(e.g., cryotherapy) is initiated during the study (as long as no concomitant androgen -
deprivation therapy [ ADT ] is given) , PSA levels must be monitored every 4 weeks from  
the initiation of the therapy. P rostate specific antigen response (defined as total PSA 
decline by ≥50% from baseline) must be confirmed by a second value within 4 weeks.  
Central Review of Scans: The 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scans will be interpreted by an 
appropriately qualified local Investigator and three independent, blinded, central readers. Each 
reader will be required to evaluate the PET/CT scans individually for the presence of 
pathological 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA uptake in the prostate bed/gland, pelvic lymph nodes, extra 
pelvic lymph nodes, visceral/soft tissue and bone.  
Expert Panel Composite Reference Standard: T he 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT findings  will 
be assessed against a composite Reference Standard. The composite Reference Standard will be determined by a n independent, blinded, central expert panel and  may consist of  
histopathology, conventional imaging modalities that are routinely used in the diagnosis and staging of PC  and PSA levels . The Investigator will be required to submit all relevant clinical 
evidence available for the participant to enable the assessment of the Reference Standard . The 
expert panel will determine the composite Reference Standard without knowledge of the 
64Cu-
SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT results . 
To assess the impact of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT on disease management, the treating 
physician will be required to fill out a Pre -SAR -bisPSMA and a Post -SAR -bisPSMA Disease 
Management Form to provide information on the treatment strategy of the participant before 
and after the information from the  local read of the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scan(s) 
becomes  available.  
See Figure 1 for the overall study design schema. Details on study procedures for each visit are 
described in Table 5 and Section 8.

must use a method of birth control with adequate barrier protection. 
4.1.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Study candidates who meet any  of the following criteria are not to be enrolled in the study: 
1. Participants who  receive d other investigational agents within 28 days prior to Day 0. 
2. Participants administered any high energy (>300 keV) gamma- emitting radioisotope 
within 5 physical half -lives prior to Day 0. 
3. Ongoing treatment or treatment within 90 days of Day 0 with any systemic therapy (e.g. ADT , antiandrogen, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone- releasing

4. Known or expected hypersensitivity to 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA or any of its components. 
5. Any serious medical condition or extenuating circumstance which the investigator feels may interfere with the procedures or evaluations of the study. 
4.2 Enrollment and Method of Assigning Participants to Treatment 
Groups  
This is a non- randomized, single -arm study. After completing  the S creening period , 
participants who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria , will be  enrolled into the 
study and receive a single administration of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA.  
Each participant will be identified in the study by a Participant Number that is assigned when  
the participant is first entered into Screening and is retained as the primary identifier for the  
participant throughout his entire participation in the trial. The Participant Number consists  of 
the Center Number (as assigned by the Sponsor to the investigative site) with a sequential  
participant number suffixed to it, so that each participant is numbered uniquely across the entire  
database. Upon signing the informed consent form  (ICF) , the participant is assigned to the next  
sequential Participant Number available to the Investigator . 
4.3 Study Blinding  
In this study, all participants will receive 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA and thus blinding of 
investigational product is not applicable.  
However, to allow for a non- biased assessment of the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT, the scans 
will be assessed by three independent central readers, blinded to the participants -specific 
information (identifiers, medical history, physical exam, laboratory results), the timepoint of 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 31 of 70 the scan, results of evaluations as part of the R eference Standard, results of other imaging 
modalities, final diagnosis / outcome, and details of the protocol.  
To allow for a non- biased assessment of the Reference Standard, an  independent central panel 
of experts will be used to  assess and determine the composite  Reference Standard. The expert 
panel will not include any of the three readers who assess the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT 
scans . The panel will not have access to the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scans  or reports  from 
the local or central read of the scans.  
4.4 Participant Withdrawal and Replacement   
4.4.1 Screening Failures and Rescreening  
4.4.1.1 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are those participants who do not meet the study eligibility  criteria. For 
participants who are considered a screen failure, the reason for screen failure will be entered 
on the screening log. The demographic information, informed consent, and inclusion/exclusion pages must also be entered on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). I f the participant  
experiences a serious adverse event ( SAE ) during the screening period , this information must 
also be entered (see Section 9.3 for SAE reporting details).  
4.4.1.2 Rescreening  
Participants who fail screening assessments may be re- screened. Rescreening and specific 
assessments to be repeated is to be discussed on a case -by-case basis with the Medical Monitor.   
Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant number as for the initial 
screening , which is deemed appropriate and practical from a reporting perspective. Participants 
may only participate in the study once .  
4.4.2 Withdrawal of Consent and Discontinuation of Participants from the Study  
Participants will be informed that they have the right to withdraw consent or discontinue from the study at any time for any reason, without prejudice to their medical care.  
Following enrolment into the study, if a participant is discontinued or withdraws consent for 
any reason, whether related to the investigational product or not, the  participant will be 
considered an early -discontinued participant. The reason for study discontinuation or 
withdrawal of consent is to be documented in the participants’ source documents and eCRF.  
Refer to Section 4.4.2.1 for individual stopping rules. 
1. Withdraw of Consent to Participate in the Study 
Withdrawal of consent occurs only when a participant (or their substitute decision maker/person responsible) does not want to participate in the study any longer, does not want any further study related visits or assessments and does not want any further s tudy related 
contact. The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research data that have already been 
collected for the study evaluation up until the point of withdrawal of consent. All biological samples that have already been collected may be retain ed and analyzed at a later date (or as 
required by local regulations).  
If a participant withdraws consent, the Investigator should make an effort to determine the 
primary reason for this decision (however the patient is not required to provide a reason) and 
record this information along with the withdrawal of consent discussi on, which should be 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 32 of 70 documented in the patient notes.  With the participants consent, the Investigator may perform 
some final safety evaluations to ensure that there are no safety risks associated with the participants withdrawal.
 Further attempts to contact the participant for study related discussions 
are not allowed unless safety findings require communication or follow -up. 
2. Investigator Decision to Discontinue the Participant  
The Investigator also has the right to discontinue participants from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Participant non- adherence to protocol requirements;  
• Any other reason based upon the medical judgment of the Investigator.  
The Investigator will make every effort to ensure that early -discontinued participants who have 
received investigational product(s) complete safety follow -up assessments (refer to Schedule 
of Assessments).  
3. Lost to Follow Up 
Reasonable efforts will be made to keep in contact with enrolled study participants. Participants who have not responded to at least three such attempts for follow -up may be deemed ‘lost to 
follow -up’. Efforts made to contact study participants must be documented in the participant’s 
file. 
4.4.2.1 Individual Stopping Rules  
No individual stopping rules appl y as only a single 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA administration  is 
delivered in the study.  
4.4.3 Pregnancy  
There is no information about the effects that 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA could have on the 
development of the fetus in humans. Therefore, it is important that female partners of sexually 
active participants , do not become pregnant during the study and agree to use adequate 
contraception. Participants will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring 
during the study in female partners, should be confirmed and reported to the Investigator.  
The Investigator should also be notified of a pregnancy of a female partner of the participant 
occurring during the study. In the event that a female partner of a participant is found to be 
pregnant  whilst the participant is enrolled in the study , the pregnancy will be followed, and the 
status of mother and child will be reported to the  Sponsor (or delegate).  
A Pregnancy Report Form will be completed and submitted for any pregnancy occurring in 
female partners of participants from enrolment until study completion.  
4.4.3.1 Acceptable Forms of Contraception  
Sexually active participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to 
participate if they agree to follow one of the following methods of contraception consistently, starting from Screening, during the study and for at least 5 days after the administration of 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA:  
• Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long- term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.  
• Are sterilized (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence of 
sperm in the ejaculate);

(WBC ), platelet count, differential WBC (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, 
lymphocytes, and monocytes), absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte 
count.  
• B iochemistry ( pre-prandial ): albumin, total protein, blood glucose, sodium, 
potassium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, uric acid, AST , ALT , total 
bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase.  
 
• Coagulation: prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time,  D-dimer.  Note: 
Coagulation may be assessed at any other timepoint, outside of those specified in the 
Schedule of assessments, in case of an abnormal result, and followed until resolution. 
• eG FR:  will be calculated from creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD- EPI) formula  and reported as mL/min . To convert 
mL/min/1.73 m2 to mL/min , multiply by the individual’s Body Surface Area 
(calculated using the Mosteller formula) and divide by 1.73. 
• B iochemical Markers:  Serum  testosterone. 
Urine samples  will be collected for the following tests: 
• Urinalysis: to include determination of protein, glucose and leukocytes (dipstick test). 
In the event of an unexplained, clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result, the test 
should be repeated and followed up until it has returned to the normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  
During the study, all out of range (abnormal) laboratory values , except for  PSA,  must be 
evaluated and commented on by the Investigator (or a qualified delegated observer at the 
investigational site) for clinical significance using one of the following categories: within 
normal limits, abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. Clinically significant observations will be recorded as AEs unless they are associated with a diagnosis that itself has been  reported as an AE (e.g., raised white cells and fever associated 
with an infection – in this case the infection is the AE and the lab value and fever are signs and 
symptoms of the AE and should not be reported separately).  
7.2.7 Total PSA 
As part of S creening, b aseline PSA will be assessed ; additionally, PSA results and dates of 2 
previous most recent measurements (prior measurements are needed to assess PSA 
velocity/doubling time ), PSA at initial diagnosis and PSA after initial definitive treatment 
(nadir) must also be recorded  on the eCRF. 
Prostate -specific antigen  will further be assessed during the  Follow- Up as specified in the 
Schedule of assessments. However, i f radiation  therapy or other salvage focal therapy (e.g., 
cryotherapy) is initiated  during the study (as long as no concomitant ADT is given) , PSA levels 
must be monitored every 4 weeks  from  the initiation of the therapy. P rostate -specific antigen  
response (defined as total PSA decline by ≥50% from baseline) must be  confirmed by a second 
value within 4 weeks.

11C-choline, approved PSMA PET  [such as 18F-DCFPyL or 68Ga-PSMA -11]) must be 
performed within 60 days of Day 0.  
For each imaging modality, the date of acquisition and result (as positive, negative or equivocal 
for recurrent PC ) must be reported on the eCRF. If equivocal, the site (s) of equivocal disease 
is also to be reported.  
All available scans completed within 60 days of Day 0 will be transferred in DICOM format 
to the central reading center with anonymization of participant specific information as specified in the Image Acquisition Manual. 
7.3.2 
64Cu-SAR- bisPSMA PET/CT  
The site will conduct the quantitative PET/CT according to the  Image Acquisition Manual, 
which contains details of scan acquisition, processing parameters and quality assurance 
procedures. For a given participant, the same scanner must be used for all scan acquisition timepoints . 
Participants will be asked to void prior to imaging. After voiding, a whole -body low dose CT 
and PET scan will be acquired starting from the mid -thigh to the skull vertex. If no dia gnostic 
quality anatomical imaging (CT or MRI) is available within 60 days of Day 0, a diagnostic 
quality CT must  be acquired as part of the Day 0 PET/CT scan. 
The PET/CT images will be transferred in DICOM format to the central reading center with anonymization of participant specific information as specified in the Image Acquisition 
Manual . 
7.3.2.1 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT  Local  Interpretation  
The 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scans will be interpreted locally by an appropriately 
qualified Investigator in a non- blinded fashion.  
The reader will be required to evaluate the PET scans individually for the presence of 
pathological 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA uptake in the prostate bed/gland, pelvic lymph nodes, extra 
pelvic lymph nodes, visceral/soft tissue and bone. C omputed tomography scans from the 
PET/CT will be available to the readers to guide anatomical localization.  
A 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive lesion will be defined as focal uptake that is greater than 
physiologic background uptake in that tissue or greater than adjacent background if no physiologic uptake is expected and judged by the reader to be suspicious for dise ase. The 
number of PET -positive lesion(s) in each anatomical subregion will be documented.  
Any incidental findings on the 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scan(s) that are of potential 
clinical relevance and are not directly associated with the objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by the investigator as per standard medical/clinical judgment. 
The processes for image acquisition, transmittal , and interpretation, including the list of regions 
and subregions to be assessed on the 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT  are detailed in the Image 
Acquisition Manual. 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 44 of 70 7.3.2.2 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT Central Interpretation  
The central reading center will receive and evaluate the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scans. 
The scans  will be interpreted by three different independent blinded readers in a random order 
at separate reading sessions. Central readers will be blinded as described in Section  4.3. 
Computed tomography scans from the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT will be available for 
anatomic correlation.  
The reader s will be required to evaluate the PET scans individually for the presence of 
pathological 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA uptake in the prostate bed/gland, pelvic lymph nodes, extra 
pelvic lymph nodes, visceral/soft tissue and bone. The same 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive 
lesion definition will be applied as for the local interpretation. Lesions that do not meet the 
criteria for a positive lesion but are deemed suspicious for PC will be recorded as equivocal. 
The number of lesion(s) in each anatomical subregion will be documented. The size (two axial 
dimensions), location, standardized uptake value ( SUV) mean and max, lesion- to-background 
ratio and reader confidence level will be recorded for up to 15 soft tissue lesions and 10 bone 
lesions by the central readers.  
The processes for image acquisition, transmittal , and interpretation are detailed in the Image 
Acquisition Manual and Imaging Review Charter.  
7.3.3 Follow -up Conventional Imaging  
Follow -up conventional imaging must be acquired for all participants  as specified in the 
Schedule of assessments , regardless of the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT findings.  
The follow -up conventional imaging must include the same modality/modalities as the SOC 
conventional imaging performed at baseline to allow for reproducible and accurate comparisons  and should include anatomical imaging (MRI or CT ; a diagnostic quality CT 
completed as part of a PET/CT scan is acceptable)  and molecular imaging (e.g., whole body 
99mTc-MDP, 18F-fluciclovine, 11C-choline, approved PSMA PET [ such as 18F-DCFPyL or 
68Ga-PSMA -11]). Scan acquisition will be completed according to  institutional protocols . 
The imaging  modality, date of acquisition and result  (including number of lesions suspicious 
for PC within each anatomical subregion)  must  be recorded on the eCRF . 
All scans  will be transferred in DICOM format to the central reading center with anonymization 
of participant specific information as specified in the Image Acquisition Manual. 
Note:  Additional follow -up conventional imaging may be completed at any other timepoint, 
outside of those  specified in the Schedule of assessments, as deemed appropriate by the 
Investigator. All follow -up scans acquired within 180 days (±15 days) of Day 0 must be 
transferred to the central reading center.  
7.4 Histopathology  
Where clinically feasible, h istopathology (from image -guided biopsy or surgery [e.g., salvage 
pelvic lymph node dissection] ) should be obtained for as many 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -
positive lesions as possible  based on the local interpretation of the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA 
PET/CT scans.  If clinically feasible, the Investigator should make every effort to obtain 
histopathology for at least one 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive lesion per region . The 
biopsy or surgery specimens  will be processed  and analyzed locally . The local pathologist 
evaluating the sample s will be blinded to the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT results.  
The procedure, date of assessment, imaging modality used to guide biopsy (if applicable) and 
local histopathology result will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 45 of 70 For participants  undergoing image -guided needle biopsy, the needle biopsy images (e.g., CT, 
transrectal ultrasound -MRI, ultrasound) of the procedure will be sent to central reading center . 
The instruction for capturing biopsy images and directions for submitting the images to the 
central reading center is specified in the Image Acquisition Manual.  
All histopathology results (and any associated images) acquired within 180 days (±15 days) of 
Day 0 must be transferred to the central reading center.  
7.5 Diagnostic Efficacy Assessments  
7.5.1 Assessment of the Composite Reference Standard  
The composite Reference Standard  may consist of histopathology, conventional imaging 
modalities that are routinely  used in the diagnosis and staging of  PC and PSA levels . 64Cu-
SAR -bisPSMA  scans will not form part of the Reference Standard . 
The Reference Standard status will be determined by an independent, blinded, central expert 
panel. The expert  panel  will establish the Reference Standard  disease status (on a participant - 
and region- level) for each participant individually, using information provided by the  site’s 
Investigator. The experts will be blinded as described in Section  4.3. 
The Investigator will be required  to submit all relevant clinical evidence available for the 
participant to enable the assessment of the Reference Standard. Relevant evidence will include:  
• All available histopathology reports related to the participants disease history;   
• All available conventional scans and related local reports collected as part of Screening 
(within 60 days of Day 0) and Follow -up (within 180 days [±15 days] of Day 0) ; 
• PSA levels recorded as part of S creening and Follow -up; 
• All available PC  related symptom and treatment  history;  
The composite  Reference  Standard  will be hierarchical in nature, with three levels  of evidence  
that will be applied as follows: 
• Level 1:  Evaluable histopathology from biopsy or surgery OR in case that 
histopathology is not available, inconclusive or negative:  
• Level 2:  Conventional imaging procedures OR if neither histopathology or 
conventional imaging are available or informative : 
• Level 3:  Confirmed PSA response following radiation or other salvage focal  therapy 
(as long as no concomitant ADT  is given ), defined as total PSA decline by ≥50% from 
baseline, confirmed by a second value within four weeks as per  the Prostate Cancer 
Working Group 3 criteria25. 
The expert panel  will use the collective information to determine  and record each region with 
histopathology demonstrating PC, the number of  lesions suspicious for PC detected on 
conventional imagin g in each anatomical subregion and whether  the participant  achieved  
confirmed  PSA response (if applicable).  
Region( s) with no histopathology demonstrating PC or no unequivocal lesion  recorded  in any 
of the anatomical subregions on conventional imaging will be deemed negative for the region 
level Reference Standard status.   
Region(s) with histopathology demonstrating PC  will qualify the region as positive for the 
region level Reference Standard status. A subregion with a t least one unequivocal lesion (or 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 46 of 70 cluster of lesions or diffuse sclerotic metastasis) on conventional imaging will qualify the 
subregion as positive for the Reference Standard status.  
If the expert panel  judged that the available information is insufficient to provide a reliable 
conclusion, the result will be recorded as non- evaluable (e.g., no follow -up assessment s were 
completed ) or inconclusive . The reason for selecting a non- evaluable or inconclusive result 
will be documented.  
Further details on the process  and interpretation of the conventional imaging  will be provided 
in the Imaging Review Charter.  
7.5.2 Assessment of Reference Standard against the 64Cu-SAR- bisPSMA PET/CT 
Results  
For the assessment of the Reference Standard  against the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT , 
region- level matching will be used for histopathology, subregion- level matching for imaging 
and participant -level matching for PSA response  to radiation or other salvage focal therapy 
(refer to Section 7.5.1) . Matching of the Reference Standard against the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA 
PET/CT results will b e completed via statistical programming .  
Assessment of r egion -level Reference Standard against the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT 
results : 
• Histopathology:  A region that is 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive (i.e., includes at 
least one unequivocal PET- positive lesion) and Reference Standard positive , will be 
assigned as true positive (TP) for the region- level status.  
• Imaging: A subregion that is 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive (i.e., includes at least 
one unequivocal PET -positive lesion) and Reference Standard positive (i.e. , includes at 
least one unequivocal  lesion  detected on conventional imaging  in that subregion) , will 
be assigned as TP. A region that includes at least one TP subregion will be assigned as 
TP for the region- level status.  
• A region that is 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive (i.e., includes at least one 
unequivocal PET -positive lesion) and is Reference Standard negative based on at least 
1 evaluable timepoint, will be assigned as false positive (FP) for the region- level status.  
• A region that  is 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -negative  (i.e., no unequivocal PET- positive 
lesion or only equivocal lesion(s) detected  within the  subregions ) and Reference 
Standard  negative,  will be assigned as true negative ( TN) for the region- level status . 
• A region that has either no n-evaluable 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA result for a specific 
timepoint or has a non- evaluable or inconclusive Reference Standard will not be 
assigned  for that timepoint . 
Assessment of p articipant -level Reference Standard against the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT 
results : 
• A participant with at least one TP region AND/OR at least one unequivocal  64Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA PET -positive lesion and confirmed PSA response  to radiation or other 
salvage focal therapy , will be assigned as TP for the participant -level status.  
• A participant with at least one  unequivocal  64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET -positive lesion 
who does not meet the above criteria to be deemed TP , will be assigned as FP for the 
participant -level status.  
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 47 of 70 • A participant with a  negative  64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT (i.e. , no unequivocal PET-
positive lesion or only equivocal lesion(s) detected  on the scan ) and negative Reference 
Standard, will be assigned as TN for the participant -level status.  
• A participant that has either no n-evaluable 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA result for a specific 
timepoint or has a non- evaluable or inconclusive Reference Standard will not be 
assigned  for that timepoint . 
False negative results (on a region-  or participant -level) will not be assigned in the study. A 
participant with negative  baseline conventional imaging and negative  64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA 
PET/CT imaging , who later demonstrates a positive result at follow -up conventional imaging  
(e.g., during the 90 -day follow -up imaging)  will not be considered a false negative as there is 
no way to determine whether the  disease was initially present, or whether the disease has 
developed since the acquisition of the  baseline and  64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA imaging. A positive  
follow -up scan must therefore be interpreted with caution  as it may reflect a different disease 
state compared to the one evaluated during the baseline conventional and 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA 
PET/CT imaging period. 
A positive 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT  within the target study population may indicate that 
this new imaging agent  is more sensitive in detecting early recurrence than other available 
modalities. The 90- and 180- day follow -up timelines have been selected to allow for further 
development  of the disease so the positive 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT findings can be 
validated  using conventional, potentially less sensitive reference modalities.  The selected  
follow -up timelines  therefore  enable evaluation of the diagnostic efficacy endpoints that relate 
to positive findings , but do not allow for a reliable assessment of false negative results . 
7.5.3 Disease M anagement  Plan  
The treating physician will be required to fill out a Pre -SAR -bisPSMA and a Post -SAR -
bisPSMA Disease Management F orm to provide information on the treatment strategy of the 
participant before and after the information from the local read of the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA 
PET/CT scan(s) becomes  available.  
The Pre- SAR -bisPSMA Disease Management Form must be completed  during Screening  by 
the treating physician to document the initial intended management plan for the participant 
based on available clinical information and conventional imaging results. 
The Post -SAR -bisPSMA Disease Management Form must be completed by the treating 
physician for all participants who complete the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scan(s). This 
management  plan will be based on the result from the local interpretation of the 64Cu-SAR -
bisPSMA PET/CT scan(s) to document whether a change to the initial intended management 
plan may be warranted due to the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT finding(s). Additionally, the 
operator will be asked to indicate which 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA  PET/CT timepoint has 
influenced the assessment. If both timepoints influenced the assessment (whether for change 
or not) both should be selected.  
7.6 Pharmacokinetics  
7.6.1 Biodistribution  of 64Cu-SAR- bisPSMA  
The biodistribution of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA utilizing the PET/CT scans will involve the 
calculation of:  
• Maximum and mean SUVs  in lesion(s), visceral/soft tissue, bone ; 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 48 of 70 • Lesion -to-background ratio. 
All biodistribution measures will be assessed centrally, according to the study Imaging Review 
Charter to ensure  a high and consistent level of quantification across all sites . 
8 VISIT -SPECIFIC PROCEDURES  
8.1.1 Screening Period ( 28 days , Visit 1 ) 
The following assessments must be performed/obtained within the 28 days before the 
participant receives the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA administration. Informed consent must be 
documented before any study- specific screening procedure is performed and may be obtained 
more than 28 days before the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA administration. Results of SOC  tests or 
examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days (within 60 days for institutional SOC conventional scans) prior to the 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA admi nistration 
may be used; such tests do not need to be repeated for S creening.  
If the start date for the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA administration extends beyond 28 days  from the 
start of the S creening assessments (e.g. due to issues related to logistics), the Investigator in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor must determine if any S creening assessments need to 
be repeated.

9 ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING  
9.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
Adverse events should be recorded from the time of informed consent until the completion of 
the Safety Visit. A dverse events recorded before the administration of the investigational 
product will be classified as non -treatment emergent AEs. All AEs recorded after the  
investigational product administration will be classified as treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ). 
Non-related AEs will only be reported and followed up until the Safety Visit.  All related AEs 
are to be followed up until resolved or judged to be no l onger clinically significant, or until 
they become chronic to the extent that they can be fully characterized . An assessment should 
be made at the last study -related visit for each patient. Certain long -term AEs cannot be 
followed until resolution within the settings of this protocol. In these cases , follow -up will be 
the responsibility of the treating physician. If during AE follow -up the case has progressed to 
the level of SAE, or if a new SAE is observed whose relationship to the study medication 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 51 of 70 cannot  be ruled out, the situation must be reported by the Investigator becoming aware of the 
information.  
Participants should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigator.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a  specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, 
endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) should be recorded as a n AE, not the procedure. 
Adverse events should be entered into the eCRF within 5 days of reporting. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study should be reported as AEs. The Investigator will exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding, or other abnormal assessment is clinically significa nt. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 
Any event that in the opinion of the Investigator is solely due to the underlying disease should 
not be reported as an AE.  
9.1.1 Adverse Drug Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonabl e possibility; i.e., the 
relationship cannot be ruled out. 
9.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information. For 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA , 
the reference safety information is included in the current IB. The reference safety information is reviewed yearly, and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized with the reporting 
period of the Development Safety Update Report.  
9.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
The Investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each AE according to Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) criteria and will also categorize each AE 
as to its potential relationship to investigational product using the categories of related or not 
related.  
9.1.3.1 Assessment of Severity  
Severity of AEs will be graded according to the following definitions:  
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity (intensity) for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study using the National Cancer Institute ( NCI) CTCAE V5.0 criteria. The 
assessments will be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment. The severity of each AE and 
SAE recorded in the eCRF should be assigned to 1 of the following:  
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 52 of 70 Mild (Grade 1):  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Moderate (Grade 2):  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age- appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Severe (Grade 3):  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**.  
Life-threatening 
(Grade 4):  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Fatal (Grade 5):  Death related to AE.  
Abbreviations: ADL = Activities of Daily Living  
*Instrumental ADL refers  to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer s to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and 
not being bedridden.  
9.1.3.2 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational product and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship to 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA . Alternative  causes, such as natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational product will be considered and investigated. 
The causal relationship of the AE to the investigational product or study procedures should be 
assessed by the Investigator (or medically qualified delegate) using the following classifications: 
Related:  An AE that follows a temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product, or for which possible involvement of the 
investigational product can not be ruled out, although factors other than the 
drug, such as underlying diseases, concurrent medical conditions, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, are also possibly responsible. 
Not related:  An AE that does not follow a temporal sequence from investigational product 
administration and/or that can reasonably be explained by other factors, such 
as underlying diseases, concurrent medical conditions, concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Event  
Any AE, due solely to the underlying disease or disease progression, should not be reported as an SAE, unless the study treatment contributed to the AE.  
An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death;  
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 53 of 70 • Life-threatening AE;  
Note: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.)  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
Note: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay will be considered an inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as an SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected 
complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as AEs and assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons (eg, no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) or where this is required for a protocolled assessment will not be considered inpatient hospitalizations.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• An important medical event; 
Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or 
surgical int ervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizatio n, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
9.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting –  Procedures for Investigators 
9.3.1 Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of consent until the Safety  Visit must be reported within 24 
hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any AE that meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria). All SAEs that the Investigator considers related to investigational product occurring until the end of the Safety Visit  must be reported to the 
Sponsor. 
To report an SAE, complete the SAE Report F orm and email the completed SAE Report F orm 
within 24 hours of awareness. An SAE Report Form will be supplied with the study binder.  
In addition to reporting the SAE to Sponsor (or designee), the Investigator must also notify the 
IRB which approved the study according to their requirements. Copies of all correspondence relating to reporting of any SAEs should be maintained in the site’s  study files and will be 
checked routinely by the study monitor.  
If the Sponsor and the Investigator consider that the SAE is investigational product related (i.e., an adverse reaction) and unexpected it will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities by the Sponsor (or designee) within the pre -defined timelines.

Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 54 of 70 9.3.2 Follow -Up Reports  
The Investigator must continue to follow the participant until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the participant dies.  
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update the SAE 
form and submit any supporting documentation (eg, deidentified participant discharge 
summary, autopsy reports), if requested.  
9.4 Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring  in a female partner of a participant  after the administration of the 
investigational product require immediate reporting. They must be reported within 24 hours after the Investigator has become aware of the pregnancy. A pregnancy report will be completed and sent within 24 hours  of becoming aware of the pregnancy. The Investigator will 
collect follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal 
sequelae in the infant that must also be reported to the Sponsor or designee. Upon awareness 
of the outcome of  the pregnancy, the Investigator must forward a follow -up Pregnancy Re port 
with any relevant information.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report the event within 24 hours of being notified of the pregn ancy report.  
9.5 Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor will report all relevant information about suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions that are fatal or life -threatening as soon as possible to the FDA and the IRBs, and in 
any case no later than 7 calendar days after knowledge by the Spons or of such a case, and 
relevant follow -up information will subsequently be communicated within an additional 8 
days.  
All other suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the FDA and the 
IRBs as soon as possible but within a maximum of 15 calendar days of first knowledge by the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor will also inform all Investigators as required.  
10 STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 General Considerations  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written after finalizing the protocol and prior to 
database lock. The SAP will detail the implementation of all the planned statistical analysis in accordance with the principal features stated in the protocol. Any deviations from the SAP will 
be presented in the final clinical study report.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, median, 25th quartile, 75th quartile, minimum, and maximum values.  
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 55 of 70 10.2 Analysis Sets  
10.2.1 Enrolled Analysis Set  
The Enrolled Analysis Set will include all participants who signed the ICF  and were enrolled 
into the study. This analysis set will be used for patient disposition summaries.  
10.2.2 Safety Analysis Set  
The Safety Analysis Set will be used to assess all safety data and will include all participants 
who receive any amount of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA.  
10.2.3 Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all participants who receive any amount of 64Cu-
SAR -bisPSMA and have 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT imaging results from at least one 
central reader. The FAS will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
10.2.4 Biodistribution Analysis Set  
The Biodistribution Analysis Set will include all participants in the Safety Analysis Set and 
have at least one biodistribution measure.  
10.3 Determination of Sample Size  
The co -primary endpoints include participant -level correct detection rate (CDR ) or true 
positive detection rate  and region- level positive predictive value (PPV).  
The assumed participant -level CDR of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT imaging is 42% in 
participants with biochemical recurrence of PC . A sample size of 40 participants is estimated 
to provide more than 85% power to achieve a lower boundary of a 2- sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence interval (CI) about the estimated CDR that exceeds 20%. Accounting for a 20% 
non-evaluable rate (including lost to follow -up), approximately 50 participants will need to 
undergo 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT in this study. 
For the co -primary efficacy endpoint of region- level PPV, assuming 65% of participants are 
estimated to have 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT positive findings in this target population and 
each participant with positive findings has an average of 1.3 positive regions, then 40 
participants are expected to produce approximately 34 positive regions. The assumed region-
level PPV rate of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT imaging is approximately 65% in all PET 
positive regions. Therefore, a sample size of 40 participants (i.e., approximately 3 4 positive 
regions) is estimated to provide more than 80% power to achieve a lower boundary of a 2- sided 
95% exact binomial CI about the estimated region -level PPV that exceeds 40%.  
10.4 Analysis Methods

analysis. Safety analyses in general will be descriptive and will be presented in tabular format with the appropriate summary statistics.   
All safety analyses will be conducted in the Safety Analysis Set.  
10.4.4.1 Adverse Event Analysis  
Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  
A TEAE is any AE  that occurs after the administration of the investigational product. 
TEAEs, TEAEs related to investigational product, TEAEs with grade 3 or higher, TEAEs with 
grade 3 or higher related to investigational product, and treatment -emergent SAEs will be

as in QTcF and QTcB maximum changes from baseline (> 30 and > 60 ms) over all post -dose 
evaluations will be summarized.  
A listing of ECG data will be provided.  
10.4.5 Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy endpoints will be assessed using the FAS.  10.4.5.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The co -primary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• Participant -level CDR  on Day 0  scan ;  
• Participant -level CDR  on Day 1  scan ;   
• Region- level PPV  on Day 0 scan ; 
• Region- level PPV on Day 1 scan . 
CDR on a participant -level for each central reader is defined as the proportion of TP 
participants out of all scanned participants who had at least 1 evaluable reference standard 
datapoint (as without any follow -up reference data it is not possible to determine if the 
participant is TP or not, which may bias the results) and will be calculated as follows: CDR = 
TP/(all scanned participants with at least 1 evaluable  reference datapoint s).  
Participants without a 
64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scan at a specific timepoint (Day 0 or Day 
1) will be excluded from the participant -level CDR calculation for that timepoint.  Participants 
with non- evaluable participant -level Reference Standard results will be excluded from the 
CDR calculation.   
PPV on a region- level for each central reader is defined as the proportion of TP regions out of 
all positive regions on the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scan with corresponding evaluable 
composite Reference Standard data and will be calculated as follows: PPV = TP/(TP+FP).  
Regions that are not positive on the 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scan at a specific timepoint 
(Day 0 or Day 1) will be excluded for the region -level PPV calculation for that timepoint.  
The anatomic regions for lesions include the following:  
Region  Description  of Anatomic Region  
1 Prostatic  
2 Pelvic lymph nodes  
3 Extra pelvic lymph nodes  
4 Visceral/soft tissue  
5 Bone  
 
The point estimates of CDR and PPV on Day 0 and on Day 1 will be computed along with the 
2-sided 95% exact binomial CIs using the Clopper -Pearson method. The primary efficacy 
analyses will be performed for each central reader.  
The following sensitivity analyses of the participant -level CDR and region -level PPV will be 
performed:  
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 58 of 70 •  
• Based on all  participants in the FAS regardless whether there are reference datapoints 
collected. Missing data will be handled as follows:  
o Worst -case imputation: 
o For the participant -level CDR on Day 0 and on Day 1 based on FAS, 
participants with missing/non -evaluable composite Reference Standard data 
will be imputed as non- true positive and included in the denominator. 
o For the region- level PPV calculation on Day 0 and on Day 1 based on FAS, 
PET/CT positive regions with missing/non- evaluable corresponding 
composite Reference Standard data will be imputed as FP and included in 
the denominator.  
o Tipping Point Analysis:  
o In addition, to examine the impact of missing or non- evaluable composite 
Reference Standard data and evaluate the robustness of the results, a tipping 
point analysis will be performed as a sensitivity analysis for participant -
level CDR and region- level PPV based on the FAS, where participants with 
missing or non- evaluable composite R eference Standard data will be 
imputed as TP  with probability of p ranging from 0 to 1 with an increment 
of 0.1 (p = 0 corresponds to none of the participants  without Reference 
Standard information in a PET positive region will be imputed as true 
positive while p = 1 means all participants  without Reference Standard 
information in a PET positive regions will be imputed as TP ). 
Details of handling of missing data will be fully described in the SAP.  
10.4.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• Participant -level PPV  on Day 0 and on Day 1;  
• Participant -level DR on Day 0 and on Day 1;  
• Participant -level FPR on Day 0 and on Day 1;  
• Region- level FPR on Day 0 and on Day 1;  
• Participant -level discrepant PET negative rate between Day 0 and Day 1 ; 
• Participant -level TNR on Day 0 and on Day 1;  
• Region- level TNR on Day 0 and on Day 1.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed on the FAS . Point estimates and  2-sided 95% 
exact binomial CIs will be presented for each central reviewer separately.  
10.4.5.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
The exploratory efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• Proportion of participants with any change in intended PC  treatment due to either the 
Day 0 or Day 1 scan;  
• Composite CDR, PPV and DR of the Day 0 and Day 1 scan;  
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 59 of 70 • CDR, participant - and region- level PPV and DR of the Day 0 and/or Day 1 scan as a 
function of baseline variables ; 
• Relationship between PET -positivity (biodistribution measures such as SUVs and 
lesion -to-background ratio), versus true/false positivity and as a function of  lesion  
location and size ; 
• Difference in the number of lesions detected per participant on the Day 0 versus the 
Day 1 scan ; 
• Lesion -level o verall agreement rate on the Day 0 and Day 1 scans , on the Day 0 and 
reference scans, and on the Day 1 and reference scans ; 
• PSA over time and change from baseline ; 
• PSA velocity  and PSA doubling time (PSADT) at the end of the study and at baseline.  
Binary exploratory endpoints will be summarized with points estimates and corresponding 2-sided 95% exact binomial CIs based on the FAS.   
Difference in the number of lesions detected per participant on the Day 0 versus the Day 1 scan will be summarized descriptively and compared using a paired t-test. Other exploratory 
endpoints including PSA value at each scheduled time point and change from baseline, PSA 
velocity, and PSADT  will be summarized using descri ptive statistics.   
Descriptive statistics, graphical methods, and statistical modeling as appropriate may be used to explore the relationship between PET -positivity (biodistribution measures such as SUVs and 
lesion -to-background ratio) and true/false positivity . 
In addition, CDR, PPV and DR
 will also be assessed as a function of  the following baseline 
variables:  
• PSA at baseline prior to the scan (<0.5, 0.5 -  <1.0, 1.0 -  <2.0, 2.0 -  <5.0, ≥5) ; 
• PSADT; 
• PSA velocity ; 
• Testosterone at baseline;  
• SUV mean and max ; 
• Lesion -to-background ratio;  
• Initial Treatment Received . 
10.4.6 Intra - and Inter -reader Reliability  Assessments  
A subset of each central reader ’s 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA PET/CT scans will be evaluated twice 
to assess the reproducibility of the readings and consistency among readers.   
The intra -reader variability of each reader will be assessed by calculating percent agreement 
(concordance) and Cohen’s pairwise kappa statistics along with the 95% CIs  for the 
dichotomous results for all participants with two scan interpretations.  
For inter -reader variability, the agreement among the three independent readers will be 
assessed by calculating per cent pairwise concordance and Fleiss’s overall multi -assessor kappa 
statistics and its 95% CI s.

Biodistribution measures of 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA including, maximum and mean SUVs in 
lesions, visceral/soft tissues, bone, and lesion- to-background ratios will be summarized 
descriptively for the Biodistribution Analysis Set.  
10.5 Interim Analysis  
There are no interim analysis planned for this study. 
10.6 Handling of Missing Data  
Exploratory sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoints will be performed using participants 
who had non- evaluable  composite Reference Standard data. Additional sensitivity analyses 
based on all participant in the FAS using the worst case imputation method and tipping point 
analysis  will also be performed to examine the impact of missing or unevaluable composite 
Reference Standard data. These methods are described in detail in Section 10.4.5.1.

 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 61 of 70 11.2 Protocol Compliance  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. 
11.3 Compliance with Ethical and Regulatory Guidelines  
The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization  of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals 
for Human Use, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant. For studies conducted under  a USA  Investigational New Drug (IND) application, the Investigator will 
ensure adherence to the basic principles of GCP as outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”; 21 CFR, Part 50, 1998; and 21 CFR, Part 56, 1998. 
This study is also subject to and will be conducted in accordance with 21 CFR, Part 320, 1993, 
“Retention of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Testing Samples.”  
Because this is a “covered” clinical study, the Investigator will ensure adherence to 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998; a covered clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted 
in a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.” This requires that Investigat ors and all sub- Investigators must provide documentation of their 
financial interest or arrangements with the Sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided before participation of the Investigator and any sub Investigator in the study. The Investigator or sub Investigator agrees to notify the Sponsor of any change in reportable financial interests during the study and for 1 year following completion of the study. Study completion is defined as the date that  the last participant has 
completed the protocol -defined activities.  
11.4 Institutional Review Board  
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the participant (such as advertisements, participant information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) will be submitted by the Investigator to an IRB. Approval f rom the IRB 
must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter from the IRB to the Investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. A signed protocol approval page, a letter confirming IRB approval of the protocol and informed consent, and a statement that the IRB is organized and operates according to GCP and the applicable laws and regulations must be forwarded to the  Sponsor before s creening participants for the study. 
Additionally, study sites must forward a signed Form FDA 1572 (Investigator Obligation Form) to the Sponsor before s creening participants for study enrollment. 
Any modifications or amendments made to the protocol or ICF after receipt of the initial IRB approval must also be submitted to the IRB for approval before implementation. Only changes necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participants m ay be initiated prior to 
IRB approval. In that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB, the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor in writing within 5 working days after implementation. If a change to the protocol in any way increases the risk to the partici pant or changes the scope of the study, then written 
documentation of IRB approval must be received by the Sponsor before the amendment may

change in scope must be provided to participants already actively participating in the study, and they must read, understand, and sign any revised informed consent  document confirming 
willingness to remain in the study. 
The Investigator must ensure that all local regulations and reporting requirements to the IRB 
are met . 
11.5 Informed Consent Process  
Note: All references to “participant” in this section refer to the study participant or his legally authorized representative.  
The Sponsor (or its designee) will provide Investigators with multicenter ICF s for this study. 
Investigators may adapt the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required elements of informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part 50.25). The final ICF s must be accepted by the Sponsor and approved by the IRB. Investigators 
must provide the Sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final ICF s before and after it is approved 
by the IRB. If any new information becom es available that might affect participants’ 
willingness to participate in the study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the ICF, the Sponsor will provide Investigators with a revised ICF.  
Prior to participating in any study- related procedure, each participant must sign and date an 
IRB-approved ICF written in a language the participant can understand. The ICF should be as 
nontechnical as practical and understandable to the participant. The I CF must provide the 
participant with all the information necessary to make an informed decision about their participation in the study, including the nature and intended purpose of the study, possible benefits, possible risks, and disclosures of the partic ipant’s personal information and personal 
health information for purposes of conducting the study. The ICF will include details of the requirements of the participant and the fact that he/she is free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and with out prejudice to their further medical care. Before informed consent is 
obtained, the participant should be given ample time and opportunity to inquire about the details of the study. All questions must be answered to the satisfaction of the participant.  
Once signed, the original ICF will be stored in the Investigator’s site file and made available for review by the Sponsor. Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the participant’s case history. All participants will receive a cop y of their signed and dated 
ICF. 
If the ICF is revised during the study and requires the participant to be re consented, informed consent will be obtained in the same manner as for the original ICF.  
11.6 Confidentiality  
Every effort will be made to maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of all participants during this clinical study. However, because of the experimental nature of this investigational product, the Investigator agrees to allow the IRB, representatives of the Sponsor and its designated agents, and authorized employees of appropriate regulatory agencies to inspect the facilities used in this study and, for purposes of verif ication, allow direct access to the study 
site records of all participants enrolled into this study. This includes providing by fax, e -mail, 
or regular mail de -identified copies of clinical, laboratory, ECG, radiology, pathology, and/or 
other test results when requested by the Sponsor. A statement to this effect will be included in the ICF and a permission form authorizing the use of protected health information will also be included. 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 63 of 70 In accordance with local and national participant privacy regulations, the Investigator or 
designee must explain to each participant that in order to evaluate study results, the participant’s protected health information obtained during the study may be shared with IRBs, the Sponsor and its designees, and regulatory agencies. It is the Investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected health information from each participant. If a participant withdraws permission to u se protected health information, it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to obtain the withdrawal request in writing from the participant and to ensure that no further data will be collected from the participant. Any data collected on the participant befor e withdrawal will be used in the analysis of study results. The Sponsor will 
only use or disclose the participant’s protected health information consistent as defined in the ICF. 
The Investigator must assure that each participant’s anonymity will be strictly maintained,  and 
that each participant’s identity is protected from unauthorized parties. Only participant initials, date of birth, and an identification code (but no participant names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample submitted to the IRB, to the S ponsor or its designees (eg, 
laboratories), or to regulatory authorities. However, sufficient information must be retained at the study site to permit sample data an d data in the database to be connected with the unique 
participant number assigned to each study participant. 
The Investigator agrees that all information received from the Sponsor, including, but not 
limited to, the investigational product, the IB, this protocol, the eCRFs, and any other study information remain the sole and exclusive property of the Sponsor duri ng the conduct of the 
study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from the Sponsor. The Inve stigator further agrees to take all reasonable 
precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. 
11.7 Study Files and Retention of Records and Biological Samples  
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified by the IRB, representatives of the Sponsor and its designated agents, and authorized employees of appropriate regulatory agencies. These documents should be classified into at least the following 2 categories: Investigator’s study file and participant clinical source documents. 
The Investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, eCRF and query forms, the 
IRB and governmental approval with correspondence, signed ICF, drug accountability records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms (eg, Form FDA 1572), an d other appropriate 
documents and correspondence pertaining to the conduct of the study. 
The required source data referenced in the monitoring plan for the study should include 
sequential notes containing at least the following information for each participant:  
• Participant identification (name, date of birth, sex, race and ethnicity);  
• Documentation that participant meets each of the eligibility criteria, eg, history, physical examination, and confirmation of diagnosis (to support inclusion and exclusion criteria);

All clinical study documents must be retained by the Investigator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (the United States, Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing appl ications in an ICH region; or, if 
no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified or for 15 years, whichever is longer. I nvestigators may be required to retain documents longer if required 
by applicable regulatory requirements, by local regulations, or by an agreement with the Sponsor. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and obtain written approval from the Sponsor before destroying any clinical study records. The Investigator will promptly notify the Sponsor in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records. The Sponsor will inform the Investigator of the date that study records may be destroyed or ret urned to the 
Sponsor. 
The Sponsor must be notified in advance and must provide express written approval of any change in the maintenance of the foregoing documents if the Investigator wishes to move study records to another location or assign responsibility for record retention to another party.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these in sealed containers outside of the study site so t hat they can be returned sealed 
to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the participant, appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the study site. 
Biological samples retained by the Investigator will be stored and maintained by the 
Investigator until notification is received from the Sponsor that the retained samples and records no longer need to be retained. The Investigator must obtain written perm ission from 
the Sponsor before disposing of any retained samples. The Investigator should promptly notify the Sponsor in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study samples. With the permission of the Sponsor, the retained samples may be trans ferred to an acceptable designee, 
such as another Investigator, another institution, a contract storage site, or to the Sponsor. 
11.8 Participant Screening Log  
The Investigator must keep a record that lists all participants who signed the ICF (including those who did not undergo s creening assessments). For those participants who declined to 
participate, post signing the ICF or were subsequently excluded from enrollment, the reasons for not enrolling in the study must be described.

Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 65 of 70 11.9 Modifications of the Protocol or Informed Consent Documents  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study participants, 
will be made only by the Sponsor. All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB in accordance with local requirements. Except as noted in  Section 11.4, IRB approval must be 
obtained before changes can be implemented.  
The ICF cannot be changed without prior written approval by the Sponsor and the study site’s IRB.  
11.10  Case Report Forms  
Authorized study site personnel will complete eCRFs designed for this study according to the completion guidelines that will be provided. An eCRF is required and must be completed for each enrolled participant, with all required study data accurately recor ded such that the 
information matches the data contained in medical records (eg, physicians’ notes, nurses’ notes, study site charts, or other study- specific source documents). The Investigator will ensure 
that the eCRFs are accurate, complete, legible, an d completed within 5 days of each 
participant’s visit. The Investigator will ensure that source documents that are required to verify 
the validity and completeness of data transcribed on the eCRFs are never obliterated or destroyed. As required by the protocol, eCRFs should also be completed for those participants who fail to complete the study (even during the s creening period). If a participant withdraws 
from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF and thorough efforts should be made to clearly do cument outcome. 
The eCRFs for this study will exist within a web -based electronic data capture (EDC) system. 
After the Investigator or the Investigator’s designees (eg, research coordinators) have been appropriately trained, they will be given access to the EDC system and will enter the data 
required by the protocol into the EDC system. Any change of data will be made via the EDC system, with all changes tracked by the system to provide an audit trail.  
The eCRF must be completed and signed by the principal Investigator or sub- Investigator (as 
appropriate) within a reasonable time period after data collection. This signature serves to attest that the information contained in the eCRF is true.  
11.11  Clinical Monitoring  
Representatives of the Sponsor or its designee will monitor this study until completion. Monitoring will be conducted through personal visits with the Investigator and study site staff as well as any appropriate communications by mail, e -mail, or telephone . The monitor is 
responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The purpose of monitoring is to ensure compliance with the protocol and the quality and integrity of the data.  
In accordance with GCP, the study monitor must have direct access to the Investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the eCRFs for consistency. The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problem s detected in the 
course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
11.12  Inspections  
The source documents for this study must be made available to appropriately qualified personnel from the Sponsor or its representatives, to the IRB, and to regulatory authority or 
Investigational Product: 64Cu-SAR -bisPSMA   Clarity Pharmaceuticals Ltd  
Protocol: CLP06  Version: 3.0, 07Dec2022  
 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 66 of 70 health authority inspectors as a part of their responsibility to protect human participants in 
research. The Investigator agrees to provide access to records, facilities, and personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or audit to representatives  of the Sponsor and regulatory 
agencies. It is important that the Investigator and relevant institutional personnel are available during monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. If the Investi gator is notified of an inspection by a regulatory authority, the 
Investigator agrees to notify the Sponsor immediately. 
11.13  Data Management  
Electronic data capture will be used to enter study data eCRFs and to transfer the data into a study- specific electronic database. Instances where the eCRF captured data are considered 
source data will be outlined in separate study specific documentation. During the data collection process, automated quality assurance programs will be used to identify missing data, out-of-range data, and other data inconsistencies. Requests for data clarification or correction 
will be forwarded to the investigative study si te for resolution. As appropriate, eCRFs, listings, 
tables, and Statistical Analysis System datasets will be provided to the study sites for review.  
Quality assurance and quality control systems will be implemented and maintained according to written standard operating procedures to ensure that the data are generated, recorded, and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulator y requirements. Data 
collection and storage systems will provide an audit trail, security mechanisms, and electronic signature capabilities that meet the requirements of FDA Title 21 of CFR Part 11 regarding electronic records and electronic signatures.  
Data security will be controlled through appropriate and specific restriction of access to only data and systems required by individual users to accomplish their roles in the data management process. Individual login and password protections will be employed at study sites and at the Sponsor or its designee. The database will exist on physically secured servers. Data backups will be done regularly and will be stored in separate facilities. Printed documents relating to the study will be secured when not under review.  
11.14  Clinical Study Insurance  
The Sponsor will secure clinical study insurance. An insurance certificate will be made available to the participating study sites before study initiation.  
11.15  Communications with Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor, working either directly or through designees, will assume responsibility for regulatory interactions with relevant regulatory authorities. The Sponsor will maintain an IND  
application for the investigational product in support of the study in the United States and will maintain similar regulatory applications with other regulatory authorities as required for conduct of the study. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Spons or (or a designee) will collect, 
assemble, and communicate all required regulatory documents (eg, Form FDA 1572, 
Investigator financial disclosure forms, protocol and protocol amendments, IB, ICFs , annual 
reports) as required by regulation. The Sponsor (or a designee) will also assume responsibility for safety reporting to regulatory authorities as described in Sectio n 9.5.  
11.16  Publication and Information Disclosure Policy  
All information provided by the Sponsor and all data and information generated by the site as part of the study (other than a participant’s medical records) are the sole property of Sponsor.

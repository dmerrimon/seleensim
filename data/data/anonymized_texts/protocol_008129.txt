WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH ? 
You are being invited to take part in a research  study about the effects of drugs on behavior. You 
are being asked to participate because you are 21 -55 years old with a recent history of  alcohol use. 
You are also being asked to participate because you have expressed interest in participating in this 
study, you passed the medical screen , and it is unlikely that you will rea ct badly to the laboratory 
setting or to the drugs you will take.  You must be at least 21 years of age to participate in this 
research study and you will be asked to provide legal proof of age.  If you volunteer to take part in this 
study you will be one of  about 25  people to do so over the next two years at the University of 
Kentucky .  
WHO IS DOING THE STUDY?  
This study is being conducted under the scientific and administrative supervision of William W. 
Stoops, Ph.D., Department of Behavioral Sciences at th e University of Kentucky College of Medicine 
and the medical supervision of Lon R. Hays, MD, M.B.A. and Abner O. Rayapati, M.D.,  Department of 
Psychiatry , at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine.  There may be other people on the 
research team ass isting at different times.  
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
This medication development experiment is testing the effects of placebo (a blank , no drug) or n-
acetylcysteine (a medication used to treat acetaminophen overdose) on the subjective, cognitive and 
physiological effects of alcohol. We are also interested in determining whether n -acetylcysteine 
impacts whether you like alcohol and want to choose to drink it . The purpose of this research is to 
gather information on how safe n-acetylcysteine and ethanol are . The results of this study will be 
shared with the sponsor providing financial support for the study  (the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism) , the Food and Drug Administration and other federal agencies, if required.  
You should und erstand that this is a research project, not a treatment program.  The procedures of 
the study are designed to provide scientific information in a way that is relatively safe and comfortable 
for you, but not to provide benefits.  If you are seeking treatment, do not agree to participate in 
the study.  This study will not help you stop using alcohol . The investigators can arrange for 
referral to an appropriate treatment program if you so desire.   
ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
You should not participate if you have a history of serious physical disease, current physical 
disease, impaired cardiovascular functioning like heart attack or stroke, high blood pressure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, history of epilepsy or seizure , diabetes, current or past histories of 
serious psychiatric disorder. You should not participate if you have a history of other significant 
medical problems.  IRB Approval

treatment for your drug or alcohol use, or are currently in successful remission from your drug or 
alcohol use. If you have ever been addicted to drugs or alcohol, you should discuss this with the 
research staff before agreeing to participate.  
If you are a female, you should not participate if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant 
during your participation in this experiment. You must be using an effective form of birth control (e.g. 
birth control pills, surgically sterilized, IUD, cervical cap with a spermicide, condoms, or abstinence), 
and you must be willing to take a pregnancy test before being accepted into the research study. You 
will also be required to take a pregnancy test prior to each experimental session. Should one of these 
tests show that you are pregnant, your participation will be terminated immediately. If you are female, 
you should not participate if you are lactating or breast feeding a baby.  
WHERE IS THE STUDY GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?  
The research proced ures will be conducted  at the University of Kentucky Laboratory of Human 
Behavioral Pharmacology (LHBP) and  at the Inpatient Unit of the Clinical Services Core (CSC ) at the 
University of Kentucky Medical Center.  Your participation in this study will last a pproximately one 
month as outlined in Table 1 below.

experimental sessions, except no alcohol will administered, nor will you stay overnight 
at the CSC.  You will be provided with doses to take at 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM through 
Day 5. Doses will be provided in a Wisepill® device that will monitor when you take the 
doses.  1-5 Placebo or n -acetylcysteine maintenance. On day 1, you will ta ke your oral dose of 
placebo or n -acetylcysteine at approximately 7:00 AM. You will then take doses to take 
at 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM through Day 5.  5 Experimental Session 1 at the CSC inpatient unit. The Experimental Session timeline is 
outlined in Table 2.  You will stay on the inpatient unit overnight after completing this 
session. 6-12 Discharge from the CSC on the morning of Day 6, followed by a 7  day washout period 
in which you do not take placebo or n -acetylcysteine.  13-17 Placebo or n -acetylcysteine maintenance. Details are the same as Days 1 -5 above.  17 Experimental Session 2 at the CSC inpatient unit.  Details are the same as those for Day 
5 above.  18-24 Discharge from the CSC on the morning of Day 18, followed by a 7  day washout period 
in which y ou do not take placebo or n -acetylcysteine.  25-29 Placebo or n -acetylcysteine maintenance. Details are the same as Days 1 -5 above.  29 Experimental Session 3 at the CSC inpatient unit. Details are the same as those for Day 
5 above.  30 Study is completed after discharge from the CSC on the morning of Day 30.   
Over the course of your approximately month -long participation,  you will be asked to complete 4 
total sessions as outlined in Table 1 above. They will consist of 1 practice  session at the LHBP  and 3 
experimental  sessions at the CSC . Experimental sessions will be completed after a period of 
maintenance on placebo or n -acetylcysteine. Each of these sessions will last about 5 hours, but you 
will be required to stay at the CSC overnight  after completing each experimental session as outlined 
in Table 2 below .

Subject's Initials _________  Witness' Initials _________  Date _________  4 WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO ? 
Before participating in this research study, it will be necessary for you to have a physical and 
psychiatric examination. During the time you participate, you must agree to participate as an 
outpatient  at the LHBP for 1 practice session  and an inpatient at the CSC  for 3 experimental sessions  
over approximately 1 month . During the time you participate, you should refrain from using any illicit 
substances . Also, please refrain from drinking alcohol 12 hours p rior to coming to the laboratory and 
consuming food or caffeine 4 hours prior to a session. The first session will be a “practice” session to 
make you familiar with the various tasks and procedures of the experiment. The remaining 
experimental sessions wil l occur as outlined in the tables above . Session s will last approximately 5 
hours each , but you will be asked to stay as an inpatient at the CSC overnight  until you are no longer 
affected by any of the alcohol you consume . During the sessions we will colle ct data conce rning your 
physiological status and  your subjective status . That is, we will record your heart rate, blood pressure, 
and temperature.  We will also repeatedly ask you to answer various questionnaires about how you 
feel and about what kind of dr ug effect you feel.  Finally, you will also have the opportunity to choose 
to consume alcohol during two 1 hour blocks as outlined in Table 2 above . The scheduled tasks pose 
no hazard or risk to you.  You must agree to complete these forms and to do the task s to the best of 
your ability and at the scheduled times. At the end of sessions, you will be paid the $40 for completing 
the session  and whatever money you earned for choosing to not consume alcoholic beverages in the 
two choice phases  described in Table 2 above.  The morning after each session, you  will be 
discharged  from the CSC, provid ed that you meet appropriate release criteria  (i.e., pass a sobriety 
test and have a breath alcohol level of 0.000) . 
During the active treatment phase (i.e., drug maintenan ce periods of the study), you will be given 
a device  called a Wisepill®  that will contain medications for you to take  and that will monitor when you 
take the medication. We ask that you take the medication at the specified time ( i.e., 7:00 AM  and 7:00 
PM) and that you return the device to us undamaged and in good working condition. We ask that you 
take that medication at the time specified, as well, returning at intervals noted in Table 1 for additional 
medication.  
During your participation, you should not use any illicit drug. There will be urine checks and 
breathalyzers prior to each experimental session. These urine and breath checks will be conducted at 
the LHBP  and CSC . If a urine screen or breathalyzer shows that you used other drugs or you have 
them in your possession, you may be dropped from the study.  If you are dropped from the study 
because you used other drugs, or had them in your possession, you will lose a substantial portion of 
the money you might have earned.  
Daily experimental procedures . On your first session, you will complete a practice  session. This 
practice session is to familiarize you with the experimental routine. Every other session will be an 
experimental session.  If you smoke tobacco cigarettes, you should understand that you will n ot be 
allowed to smoke during the experimental session which will last approximately  5 hours. We have 
included a table above to help you better understand the study protocol . 
Drugs and Drug Administration .  During the experiment you will be given doses of commonly 
prescribed drugs or recreational  drugs. Drugs will be administered by mouth.  The drugs tested will be  
placebo (a blank, no drug), an acetaminophen overdose treating medication  ( n -acetylcystine  
[Acetadote ®]) and alcohol .  
The prescription drugs wi ll be administered in doses approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). These drugs will be administered alone and in combination.   
 
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS?  
The physiological measures, cognitive -behavioral  tasks and subjective -effects questionnaires 
present no risks exceeding those of everyday experience.  The primary risks to participation are those 
specifically related to the ingestion of the study drug s. The drugs under study occasionally produces  
side effects  and these  are outlined in the table s below. We will monitor for these side effects during 
experimental sessions at  CSC. If you feel you are experiencing any of these side effects, you should 42362
        
Subject's Initials _________  Witness' Initials _________  Date _________  5 tell the nursing staff or physician.  In addition to the risks listed below, you m ay experience a 
previously unknown risk or side effect.  
 Possible Risk or  
Side Effect of Alcohol  How often has it  
occurred?  How serious is it?  Can it be corrected?  Drowsiness, slurred speech, 
headache, gastrointestinal 
upset, breathing difficulties, 
distorted vision and hearing, 
impaired judgment and 
decreased perception and 
coordination  These are likely 
to or will occur.  Somewhat serious  These side effects are 
likely to decrease over time 
as the medications clear 
from your system.  Blackouts (memory lapses, 
where the drinker cannot 
remember events that 
occurred while under the 
influence), anemia, 
unconsciousness and 
coma These are 
extremely 
uncommon.  Very Serious  No.  Possible Risk or  
Side Effect of n -
acetylcysteine  How often has it  
occurred?  How seriou s is it? Can it be corrected?  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation, rash, fever, 
headache, drowsiness, 
reduced blood pressure  These are likely 
to or will occur.  Somewhat serious  These side effects are 
likely to decrease over time 
as the medications clear 
from your system.  Liver damage  This is extremely 
uncommon.  Very Serious  This may go away with 
treatment.   
WILL YOU BENEFIT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
Understand that you are not a patient receiving medical treatment and that you will not receive  any 
direct benefits from this study. However, the knowledge gained will contribute to a better 
understanding of alcohol  effects and may result in improved therapeutic treatments.  If you are 
seeking treatment, please notify the investigator now and he will  make the necessary referral.  
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  
If you decide to take part in the study, it should be because you really want to volunteer.  You will 
not lose any benefits or rights you would normally have if you choose not to volunteer . You can stop 
at any time during the study and still keep the benefits and rights you had before volunteering.   
IF YOU DON’T WANT TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY, ARE THERE OTHER CHOICES?  
If you do not want to be in the study, there are no other choices except not to take part in the study . 
WHAT WILL IT COST YOU TO PARTICIPATE?  
Participating in this research study will not cost you anything.  The clinical laboratory tests, physical 
examination and psychiatric screen described above will be paid by a grant from the National Institute 
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism  (NIAAA). The University of Kentucky may not be allowed to bill your 
insurance company, Medicare or Medicaid for the medical procedu res done strictly for research.  
Therefore, these costs  will be paid by t he sponsor (the NIAAA).

Subject's Initials _________  Witness' Initials _________  Date _________  6 WHO WILL SEE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GIVE?  
Every effort will be made to maintain the confidentiality of your study records. The data from the 
study may be published; however, you will not be identified by name. Your identity will  remain 
confidential, unless you give prior written approval or unless it meets our disclosure criteria (i.e., 
about communicable diseases, abuse of a child or elderly person or that you intend to harm yourself 
or others). Your name, address , and social se curity number will be listed on the receipt for payment 
that you receive, as required by the Internal Revenue Service; but no information about your 
participation in this research project will be released. We will be collecting your social security number 
for payment purposes. You cannot participate in this research if you withhold your social security 
number. A certificate of confidentiality has been obtained from the Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS). This certificate protects the investigato rs from being forced to release any research 
data that identifies you, even under a court order or subpoena. This protection, however, is not 
absolute. The investigators will report certain communicable diseases, abuse of a child or elderly 
person or that you intend to harm yourself or others  to the appropriate authorities. Also, because this 
research is regulated by the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and The University of Kentucky, staff from these and other DHHS  agencies may review 
records that identify you. However, it is the policy of these agencies and of these investigators that 
every attempt will be made to resist demands to release information that identifies you. When results 
of this study are published, your name will not be used.  
CAN YOUR TAKING PART IN THE STUDY END EARLY?  
You can discontinue your participation in this study at any time. If you choose to withdraw from the 
study, you will be required to remain in the facility until the investigators are s atisfied that you are no 
longer affected by the drug. During this time, you will be free to spend your time engaged in activities 
that are not part of the study. You should understand that you must remain in the facility in order to 
protect yourself and others from the effects of the drug and that your judgment while you are affected 
by the drug may be impaired sufficiently to necessitate that you remain in the facility.   
You should understand, however, that if you decide to withdraw from the study early yo u will not 
receive any of the completion allowance described below. You will receive the $40 per session 
completion allowance for each of the experimental sessions you completed.   
You should understand the principal investigator on this project, William W.  Stoops, Ph.D., can 
terminate your participation for the following reasons: 1) failure to adhere to patients rules for CSC, 2) 
if you verbally or physically assault another volunteer, patient , or staff member on the CSC, 3) if your 
behavior is disruptive to other ongoing studies that are conducted on the CSC, 4) if your behavior is 
disruptive to the other volunteers, patients, research staff , or medical staff on the CSC, 5) failure to 
comply with the alcohol, drug, and food restrictions, 6) failure to compl y with the pregnancy 
restrictions, 7) failure to take the doses as prescribed or complete  a scheduled experimental session,  
8) failure to perform the behavioral tasks to the best of your ability,  9) if you leave the hospital against 
the advice of the princ ipal investigator or the medical doctors.  If you are terminated for any of these 
reasons, it will be deemed that you did not complete all of your scheduled experimental sessions and 
you will not receive the completion allowance described below.  
You should also understand that the medical doctors on this project, Lon R. Hays, MD, M.B.A. 
and Abner O. Rayapati, M.D.,  can terminate your participation if they do not feel that it is medically 
safe for you to continue.  If your participation is terminated for medic al reasons, you will receive the 
$40/session completion allowance for each of the experimental sessions you completed.  
If you choose to withdraw from the study early, the data collected until that point will remain in the 
study database and may not be remo ved. The individuals conducting the study may need to withdraw 
you from the study and the study intervention  and/or medication  will no longer be provided by the 
investigator and may  not be accessible commercially . This may occur if you are not able to foll ow the 
directions they give you, if they find that your being in the study is more risk than benefit to you, or if the 
agency funding the study decides to stop the study early for a variety of scientific reasons. It is not 42362
        
Subject's Initials _________  Witness' Initials _________  Date _________  7 expected that withdrawing from the study will lead to risks in your health and welfare, but investigators 
may request  follow up appointments if you withdraw .  
ARE YOU PARTICIPATING OR CAN YOU PARTICIPATE IN ANOTHER RESEARCH STUDY AT 
THE SAME TIME AS PARTICIPATING IN THIS ONE?  
You may not take part in this study if you are currently involved in another research study.  It is 
important to let the investigator/your doctor know if you are in another research study.  You should 
also discuss with the investigator before you agree to participate in  another research study while you 
are enrolled in this study.  
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET SICK OR HURT DURING THE STUDY?  
If you believe you are hurt or if you get sick because of something that is due to the study, you 
should call Lon R. Hays, M.D., M.B.A. at (859) 323 -6021 x 79015 or Abner O. Rayapati, M.D.  at (859) 
257-9175 immediately.  You can also call 911 in the case of an emergency. Dr. Hays or Dr. Rayapati  
will determine what type of treatment, if any, is best for you at that time.  The medical costs rela ted to 
your care and treatment because of research related harm will be your responsibility.   
It is important for you to understand that the University of Kentucky does not have funds set 
aside to pay for the cost of any care or treatment that might be necessary because you get hurt or 
sick while taking part in this study. Also, the University of Kentucky will not pay for any wages you 
may lose if you are harmed by this study.  
The medical costs related to your care and treatment because of research related  harm will be 
your responsibility.  
You do not give up your legal rights by signing this form.  
WILL YOU RECEIVE ANY REWARDS FOR TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
You will be paid for your participation in this experiment. You will earn payments for attending 
visits, making certain selections during experimental sessions,  and taking medications as directed.   
Specifically, you will earn $40 for each practice and experimental session  that you finish. This will be 
paid to you upon completing that session . If you compl ete the entire study (i.e., complete 1 practice 
session and 3 experimental sessions over approximately one month), you will earn an additional $40  
per session bonus  at the end of the study. You can also earn money based on how you choose 
alcohol (or not) during experimental sessions. During each experimental session, as outlined in Table 
2 above, you will have the opportunity to choose between 8 alcohol doses and money. For each 
alcohol dose you do not choose, $3.00 will be added to your session completion payment. So, if you 
do not choose to drink any of the alcohol during an experimental session, you can earn an additional 
$24. Thus, the maximum amount of money you can earn from completing practice and experimental 
sessions is $392 ($160 [session completio n payment]  +$160 [study completion bonus]  +$72 [total 
amount available if you do not choose alcohol doses during any experimental sessions]).  
You will earn $10 for coming to pick up your study doses at the outset of each maintenance 
period as outlined in Table 1. You will also earn money if you take the doses given to you as  
prescribed. Specifically, on the first day of maintenance  that you take your doses at 7:00 AM and 7:00 
PM, as verified by the Wisepill®, you will earn $5  for that day. For each consecutive day that you take 
doses as prescribed, that payment will increase by $2 (e.g., you will earn $7 on the second day in a 
row that you take your doses at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM as verified by the Wisepill®).  
If you complete the entire study, attending each visit as scheduled and taking each dose as 
directed, you can earn up to approximately $707 .  
You should understand that if you make more than a total of $600 by participating in research 
projects, the University of Kentucky will report your earnings to the  appropriate state and federal 
government agencies (i.e., Internal Revenue Service [IRS]).  You should further understand that it is 
your responsibility to determine how these earnings might affect your personal financial situation.

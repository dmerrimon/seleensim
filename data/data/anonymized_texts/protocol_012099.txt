Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Study Design Overview:   
This multi -center, open -label, randomized study will enroll subjects with metastatic RCC of all 
histologies who have evidence of progression on or after the last regimen received and have also 
received at least 2 prior systemic regimens ,1 of which is an anti -VEGF agent (cle ar cell subjects). 
Non-clear cell RCC is a heterogeneous group of tumors typically not driven by von Hippel -Lindau 
(VHL) gene and sensitivity to anti -VEGF treatments differ from that shown in clear cell RCC. Hence, 
subjects with non -clear cell histology a re only required to have progressed on or after at least one anti -
VEGF regimen.  
Subjects with non -clear cell histology must also have ENPP3 po sitive IHC staining at prescreening.  
Positivity is defined as an IHC H -score ≥ 15.  Non -clear cell subjects who se tissue has an IHC H -score 
of ≥ 15 will qualify to screen for the study.  
Clear cell subjects are not required to be screened for ENPP3 to qualify the study, but subjects must 
submit tissue during the study for retrospective target expression assessment by IHC. 
Subjects will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to either AGS -16C3F or axitinib.  Randomization will be 
stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG )Performance Status (0 or 1), the 
number of prior systemic RCC regimens (2 or > 2) and RCC histology (clear cell or non -clear cell). 
For stratification purpose:
Non-clear cell subjects who have progressed after only one prior anti -VEGF regimen will be 
regarded the same as those clear cell subjects who have progressed after 2 prior system ic RCC 
regimens. 
Non-clear cell subjects who have progressed after > 1 prior systemic RCC regimens will be 
regarded the same as those clear cell subjects who have progressed after > 2 prior systemic RCC 
regimens. 
Stratification Categories for Randomizati on Process (see Table 3below)
Prior System ic RCC Regimen 
Stratum  Clear Cell Subjects Non-Clear Cell Subjects
2 2 prior systemic RCC regimens 1 prior systemic RCC regimen
> 2 > 2 prior systemic RCC regimens > 1 prior systemic RCC regimens
The RCC histology categorization is defined as the following:
Clear cell group:
oClear cell
oClear cell component
oMixed clear cell
Non-clear cell group:
oPapillary and everything else*
* everything else: chromophobe, collecting duct, renal medullary, etc., not so common but possible 
other RCC histologies
Subjects will be eligible to continue receiving treatment on study until disease progression per RECIST 
v.1.1, unacceptable toxicity, investigator’s decision, or study withdrawal.  Subjects will also be 
discontinued from treatment if a significant non -compliance occurs (e.g., those that compromise study 
objectives or subject safety), or if a subject is lost to follow -up.
All subjects will be required to have a Safety Follow -Up visit at least 28 days (+ 7 days) after the last 
dose (Refer to Section 5.2.7 ).  
All subjects will be followed for survival approximately every 8 weeks from the Safety Follow -Up 
visit. This will be done by telephone, until death or study closure, whichever occurs first. A standard of 
care clinic visit can be used in lieu of a te lephone call, if the subject is already coming to clinic.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Those subjects who discontinued the study for reasons other than objective disease progression by 
RECIST v.1.1 will continue to have disease assessments every 8 weeks (± 7 days) counting from 
C1D1 . This will continue until subject has radiologically confirmed progression, initiates a new 
therapy, study closure or subject dies.
The primary endpoint is PFS based on investigator assessment utilizing RECIST v.1.1.  Secondary 
endpoints include PFS per blinded central review, and DCR, ORR, DOR (each of the 3 based on 
investigator review), OS, Safety, and PK.
The study will have an Independent Data -Monitoring Committee (IDMC).
Treatment Plan:  
Subjects randomized to AGS -16C3F will be administered at 1.8 mg/kg as a single 60 -minute 
intravenous ( IV)infusion once every 3 weeks.  Therapy may be interrupted and/or dose adjusted in 
case of toxicity. Dose changes must be discussed with the Medical Monitor.
These subjects must also use 1% prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension prophylactically 
(prophylaxis steroid drops) starting from Day ( -1) of each treatment cycle (Refer to Table 5in Section 
5.1.3.1 ).  Prophylaxis steroid drops will be applied to both eyes, 1 drop to each eye ,6 times daily while 
awake for the first 7 days of each cycle (starting at Day [ -1]), then 4 times daily while awake for an 
additional 7 days, and then stopped.  This will be repeated in each treatment cycle.  Should the 
subsequent dose be delayed, the “no prophylaxis steroid eye drop u se”period will extend.  The study 
will not provide the prophylaxis steroid drops (i.e., each site to supply); but the cost will be reimbursed.
Subjects randomized to axitinib will all have a starting dose of 5 mg ,administered twice daily 
continuously , by mouth . This dose may be adjusted during the study as needed, as defined in the 
product label and local institutional guidelines, in doses ranging from 2 to 10 mg ,administered twice 
daily continuously , by mouth . Axitinib dose changes may be discussed wit h the Medical Monitor at the 
discretion of the Investigator.
For both treatment arms , subjects will have disease assessments every 8 weeks (± 7 days) counting 
from C1D1, irrespective of any treatment hiatus.
Subject may continue therapy if the disease sta tus is at least Stable Disease (SD) per RECIST 
v.1.1. 
If the treatment hiatus will be longer than 5 weeks, each case must be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor.
Treatment Re -challenge:
The Medical Monitor must be consulted for all AGS -16C3F toxicities that may require adjustment in 
treatment schedule and/or dose. AG S-16C3F dose modifications and/ or treatment schedule 
modifications must be discussed and agreed to in writing by the Medical Monitor on a case -by-case 
basis before any adjustment is made.  
In case of a therapy hiatus longer than 5 weeks, the plan for resuming therapy must be discussed with 
the Medical Monitor .
Disease Assessment:  
A disease assessment (CT or MRI) will be performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) counting from C1D1, 
irrespective of any treatment delays.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Concomitant Medication Restrictions or Requirements:   
The investigator may prescribe any medication necessary to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the 
subject during the study. Please refer to Section 5.1.3.2 .  If however, the investigator determines that 
any of the following medications are necessary to provide adequate medical support to the subject, the 
subject must be withdrawn from further study drug administration. Protocol prohibited medications 
that are needed temporarily to treat an AE is permitted at investigator’s discretion (e.g., dexamethasone 
used to treat nausea).
1.Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, monocolonal antibody th erapy or other medications 
intended for antitumor activity (palliative radiation is permitted provided it does not interfere with 
subject safety and efficacy of the study drug being administered. Palliative radiation cannot be 
administered to any target le sion)
2.Investigational products or therapy other than AGS -16C3F
3.For subjects randomized to axitinib only: Drugs that are known strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (Refer 
to Section 5.1.3.2 and Appendix 12.1 for list of excluded drugs).   
Duration of Treatment:   
Subjects will be eligible to continue receiving treatment on study until disease progression per RECIST 
v.1.1, unacceptable toxicity, investigator’s decision, or study withdrawal.  Subjects will also be 
discontinued from treatment if a significant non -compliance occurs (e.g., those that compromise study 
objectives or subject safety), or if a subject is lost to follow -up.
Prescreening 
Subjects with RCC of non -clear cell histology must sign the prescreening ICF and be prescreened for 
ENPP3 expression prior to undergoing screening procedures for the main study.  Tumor tissue, from a 
primary or metastatic site (excluding bone), will be sub mitted to the Sponsor -designated CLIA certified 
laboratory for ENPP3 determination by IHC.  An IHC H -score of ≥ 15 is required for non -clear cell 
subjects to qualify for study screening.  IHC H -scores for ENPP3 eligibility will not expire for the 
duration of the study (i.e., there is no time limit from prescreen qualification to screening start).  Every 
effort will be made to report the IHC H -score to the inv estigator ≤ 72 hours of sample receipt at the 
Sponsor -designated CLIA certified laboratory provided that the specimens were received in good 
condition along with all required documents fully completed.
Clear cell histology subjects are not required to be screened for target expression to qualify for the 
study but must provide tissue during the study.  Co nsent to provide tissue is included in the main study 
informed consent form.  Clear cell histology subjects’ specimens will be batch assayed during the 
study.  The IHC H -score will be reported back to the investigator for information only when the data 
become available.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Ocular Toxicities 
A complete eye exam will be done during screening . Subjects randomized to AGS -16C3F ,will have a 
complete eye exam done after the Cycle 2 Day 1 dose but before the Cycle 3 Day 1 dose , after the
Cycle 5 Day 1 dose but before the Cycle 6 Day 1 dose , and as clinically indicated. Subjects randomized 
to axitinib will have a complete eye exam done post baseline as clinically indicated. The frequen cy of 
ophthalmology follow -ups outside of protocol requirement is at the discretion of the Investigator and 
ophthalmologist. 
Ocular symptoms reported by the subject during clinic visits will be graded per CTCAE v4.03 (i.e., 
symptom based assessment) and t his will guide the treatment decision for that visit and the necessity 
for a follow up ophthalmology consult.
An Eye Symptom Questionnaire (ESQ) will be administered at every visit in the oncology clinic. 
Please see the Study Guide for the form and for com plete instructions.
If a subject develops ocular toxicity, the following guidelines may be used:
Subject Reported Symptom Based Ocular AE (i.e., per CTCAE v4.03) (see Table 10below )

2 May continue treatment per dose and schedule at 
Investigator discretionRequired; must occur prior to the 
subsequent cycle.
3 Hold treatment Required; must occur prior to the 
subsequent cycle.
Clinical Ocular AEs are objective findings (e.g., keratitis, macular edema, retinal degeneration) from 
the ophthalmology evaluation. Clinical Ocular AE grading will be determined based on visual acuity 
(VA) change from screening (baseline) .
The process for grading Clinical Ocular AEs is outlined in Section 5.6.5.2 .
Corneal Clinical Ocular AEs 
If Clinical Ocular AE is Grade 3, Medical Monitor will be consulted for treatment decision.
If Clinical Ocular AE is Grade 4, subject will be permanently discontinued from study treatment. 
Non-corneal related clinical ocular AEs
Clinical Ocular AEs othe r than ocular surface disease/ keratopathy in nature, irrespective of the 
grade, must be discussed with the Medical Monitor before the subsequent dose ( per axitinib 
product label, patients treated with this product experienced both retinal artery and retinal 
vein occlus ions. Please see product label for details) .
The ophthalmology report along with the completed study provided cover form will be forwarded to 
the Investigator in a timely manner. The investigator will review the ophthalmology report to guide 
further treatment decisions.  
The redacted ophthalmology report will be forwarded to the Sponsor in a timely manner.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Statistical Methods: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is progression -free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the earliest of documented disease progression as defined by RECIST v 1.1 per 
investigator radiology review, or de ath from any cause. Disease assessment will continue until disease 
progression, even after theoriginally assigned treatment is discontinued.  
The primary analysis of investigator assessed PFS will be performed in accordance with the intention -
to-treat (I TT) principle. All subjects who undergo randomization will be included in the primary 
analysis.  Subjects will be grouped according to the treatment groups assigned by randomization.  
For the primary analysis of PFS, the difference in treatment effect between treatment groups will be 
tested using the stratified log rank test (on ECOG P erformance Status and the number of prior systemic 
RCC regimens) at a one -sided 0.1 significance level. Histology will not be used as a stratification 
variable in inferent ial comparison because a limited number of non -clear cell subjects is expected to be 
enrolled in the study (no more than 26 non -clear cell histology).
Estimation of the hazard ratio for treatment and its corresponding one -sided 90% CI will be determined 
using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (on ECOG P erformance Status and the number of 
prior systemic RCC regimens), without any other covariate. A two -sided 95% CI will also be reported 
in the clinical study report. Homogeneity in the hazard ratios between strata will be examined by 
Wald’s test. The corresponding results without stratification will be reported as supplemental analyses. 
The adequacy of the model will be evaluated, including an assessment of the proportional hazards 
assumption ( Therneau, 2000 ). Exploratory subgroup analyses may be conducted to assess potential 
heterogeneity of treatment effects across levels of baseline characteristics.
For the primary analysis, PFS will be right -censored for subjects who me et one or more of the 
following conditions:
Subjects with no post -baseline disease assessments unless death occurred prior to the first planned 
assessment (in which case death will be considered a PFS event )
Subjects who initiate subsequent anti -cancer the rapy or intervention in the absence of documented 
progression
Subjects who die or have disease progression after missing 2 or more consecutively scheduled 
disease assessment visits
Subjects who are last known to be alive and progression -free on or before t he data cut -off date
For such subjects, PFS will be right -censored based on the May 2007 FDA Guidance for Industry 
“Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics”. Sensitivity analyses will 
be performed to evaluate the robustness of the PFS results derived under the primary analysis 
(Bhattacharya, 2009 ; Carroll, 2007 ; Stone, 2011 ).  
Progression -free survival by blinded central radiology review and overall survival, defined as the 
number of months from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, will be 
evaluated as secondary endpoints. They will be analyzed using the same methodology as described for 
the primary endpoint.
Disea se control rate (DCR) will be estimated for each treatment group based on the crude proportion of 
subjects who have a best overall response of CR, PR or SD. For DCR, SD with a minimum duration of 
6months from the date of randomization is required. Objecti ve response rate (ORR) will be estimated 
for each treatment group based on the crude proportion of subjects who have a best overall response of 
CR or PR. The inferential comparison between treatment groups for both DCR and ORR by 
investigator and central r eview will be made using the stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi -square 
test at a two -sided significance level of 0.05.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Duration of objective response (DOR) is defined as the time from the date of the first response of CR 
or PR (whichever is first recorded), and subsequently confirmed, to the first date of documented 
progressive disease or death due to any cause. Duration of response will be summarized for subjects 
who have best overall response of CR or PR.
Safety will be evaluated based on the inc idence of AEs (including Gr ade3 and 4 AEs, treatment -
related adverse events, serious adverse events, and AEs requiring discontinuation of study treatment), 
electrocardiogram ( ECG )and laboratory changes and vital signs.  AEs will be graded using the 
Natio nal Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grading 
scale, version 4.03. Ocular toxicities based on ophthalmology exams reported on the Eye Exam eCRFs 
will be graded using the study specific ocular criteria and these wil l be separately tabulated. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the PK parameter estimates and subject concentration plots 
over time may be generated.  Please refer to Section 7.6
Descriptive statistics for the incidence of human native antibody (AGS -16C3) and antibody drug 
conjugate (AGS -16C3F) antibody formation will be provided by treatment group.
Sample size justification: 
For subjects with metastatic RCC who have progressed after at least 2 prior lines of therapy, a median 
PFS of 4 months is anticipated for the control agent.  It is hypothesized that AGS -16C3F will improve 
median PFS in such subjects by 2 months (i.e., 4 vs 6 months).  Under the assumption of exponential 
distribution of PFS, such an improvement corresponds to a hypothesized hazard ratio of 0.667.  If this 
hypothesized hazard ratio is true, 110 PFS events provide 80% power to achieve a one -sided p -value of 
0.1 or smaller.  Such a result will be achieved when the observed hazard ratio is 0.783 or smaller; and 
the observed difference in median PFS is 1.1 months or larger (assuming observed median PFS for the 
control arm is 4 months).  Assuming accrual of approxi mately 7 subjects per month for 18 months, 110 
PFS events are projected 24 months after the date the first subject is randomized.  Approximately 134 
subjects may be enrolled to accommodate for up to 10% of subjects who may become lost to follow -
up. 
Effic acy:  
PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest of documented disease 
progression as defined by RECIST v.1.1 or death from any cause.  Disease assessment will continue 
until disease progression, even after the originally as signed treatment is discontinued.  
PFS will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method with 95% confidence intervals 
calculated about the median using Greenwood’s formula. For the primary analysis of PFS, the 
difference in treatment effect between treatment groups will be tested using the stratified log rank test 
(on ECOG P erformance Status and the number of prior systemic RCC regimens) at a one -sided 0.1 
significance level.
Pharmacokinetics:   
The PK data for ADC and MMAF will be analyzed using the noncompartmental method. Parameters to 
be assessed will include concentrations at the end of infusion or maximum observed concentration 
(CEOI or Cmax), concentrations at trough (C trough ), time to maximum observed concentration (T max), 
partial ar ea under the concentration time curve (AUCτ) for Cycle 1 and 4, and either terminal or 
apparent terminal half -life (t 1/2) as appropriate. Additionally, clearance (CL) and volume of distribution 
at steady state (V ss) will be included as appropriate. Descrip tive statistics will be provided for the PK 
parameter estimates and subject concentration plots over time may be generated.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 51 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Back ground
Disease
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2% to 3% of all malignant diseases in adults. I t is 
the seventh most common cancer in men and the ninth most common in women. 
Historically , treatment has focused primarily  on nephrectom y, followed b y nonspecific 
immunotherapy , and sometimes radiation therap y. Nonspecific immunotherapy includes 
treatment with the cy tokines interleukin -2 or interferon -2α, as either single agents or in 
combination ( Belldegrun et al , 2008 ).  After surgical e xcision, 20 -30% of patients will develop 
metastatic disease within 1 -3 years, often in the lung ( Motzer, 2011 ).  Median survival for 
patients with metastatic disease is approximately 13 months ( Ljungberg et al , 2010 ). 
Since 2005, 10 agents have been approved in the United States and other world regions for 
the treatment of advanced RCC: sorafenib (Nexavar®), sunitinib (Sutent®), temsirolimus 
(Torisel®), everolimus (Affinitor®), bevacizumab (Avas tin®in combination with interferon 
alpha),  pazopanib (Votrient®), axitinib (I nlyta®), cabozantinib (Cabometyx®), lenvatinib 
(Lenvima®in combination with everolimus), and nivolumab (Opdivo®). These drugs target 
specific pathway s important in RCC, includi ng angiogenesis and mTOR signaling, or act as a 
checkpoint inhibitor, allowing the immune s ystem to fight the cancer.  Their use was shown 
mostly  to affect response rate and/or duration. 
While these drugs which either block the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway , 
inhibit mammalian target of rapam ycin (mTOR), or block the signal that prevents activated T 
cells from attacking the cancer have significantly  increased both treatment options and 
improved outcomes for patients with advanced RCC, th e vast majority  still relapse. 
The recent advances in treatment options mainly  affected patients with clear cell histology , 
while no real progress has been made in those with other histologies.
A novel mechanism of action drug to treat advanced RCC of all histologies with a different 
treatment approach is much desired.
Agensys Antibody Drug C onjugate against R enal Cell Carcinoma
AGS -16C3F, an antibody  drug conjugate (ADC) developed by  Agensy s, is comprised of a 
chinese hamster ovary  (CHO) cell line -derived antibody  against ENPP3, conjugated to 
monomethy l auristatin F (MMAF), a microtubule disruptive agent.  A Phase 1 study  was 
conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of AGS -16C3F administered 
monotherap y inmetastatic RCC subject s.  This Astell as Phase 2 study  is planned based on 
the results of the Phase 1 study .  Results from the Phase 1 study  arepending full data 
analysis.
ENPP3 Antigen Target and Expression in Cancer
The antigen target, ENPP3 (referred to as AGS -16),was cloned from a patie nt renal 
carcinoma specimen and identified as an 875 amino acid ty pe II single transmembrane

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5antigen that is upregulated in the majority  of renal and in a subset of hepatocellular cancers.  
Sequencing of AGS -16 identified it as ENPP 3 (CD203c), one of 7 mem bers of a family  of 
cell surface ectonucleotide phosphodiesterases -pyrophosphatases (PDEs), ENPP1 -7 (Deissler 
et al, 1995 ; Jin-Hua et al, 1997 ,Buhring et al, 2001 ; Goding et al, 2003 ; Stefan et al, 2005 ). 
The phy siological substrate of ENPP3 is unknown, but studies have suggested that the 
enzy me catal yzes extracellular nucleotides (e.g., ATP; Goding et al, 2003 ).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) and tissue cross reactivity  studies have shown restricted 
expression of ENPP3 in normal tissues predominantly in a subset of cells in the kidney  
cortex.  L ow levels of staining were also observed in the epithelium o f the fallopian tube, a 
subset of cells within gastro intestinal tract epithelium, in uterine endometrium ,parotid gland , 
andthe cortex of the th ymus . Flow cy tometric analy sis has also shown that ENPP3 is 
expressed on activated basophils and mast cells ( Buhring, 1999 ). ENPP3 is highl y expressed 
in approximately  90% renal clear cell carcinoma; 69% papillary  RCC and 27% hepatocellular 
carcinoma as determined at Agens ys by staining tissue microarrays with an 
immunohistochemistry  antibody  specific for ENPP3.
1.2 Non-clinical and Clinical Data
Antibody Drug Conjugate AGS -16C3F Non -clinical Pharmacology
AGS -16C3F is comprised of a full y human IgG2 kmAb, following conjugation with the 
cytotoxic drug MMAF via a non -cleavable maleimidocaproy l (mc) linker.  MMAF is a 
synthetic analog of the naturally  occurring tubulin -binding drug, dolastatin 10, that was 
modified to contain a charged C -terminal phen ylalanine residue ( Doronina et al , 2006 , Pettit, 
1987 ). Conjugation takes place on cy steine residues that comprise the interchain disulfide 
bonds of the antibody  to yield a product with a target drug toantibody  ratio of 4.0 + 0.5.
AGS -16C3F binds specifically  to ENPP3 (AGS -16)expressed on the surf ace of renal, 
hepatocellular and chronic my elogenous leukemia (CML ) cells with high affinity  (Kd = 0.54 
nM).  Following binding to cell surface ENPP3, AGS -16C3F is internalized and trafficked 
through the endocy tic pathway  to the ly sosomes where catabolism results in release of 
cysteine adducts of mcMMAF that subsequentl y bind to and inhibit microtubules ( Sutherland 
et al, 2006 ). 
The mechanism of action and catabolism of AGS -16C3F is similar to that of other mAbs 
conjuga ted with non -cleavable linkers ( Polson et al , 2009 ; Oflazoglu et al , 2008 ; Erickson et 
al, 2006 ). These ADCs have the potential to y ield an excellent therapeutic index due to 
increased stability  of  the non -cleavable linker in circulation and impaired cellular access of 
the charged metabolic products produced intracellularly (Alley et al, 2009 , Doronina e t al, 
2006 ). The pharma cologic data collected for AGS -16C3F demonstrate that it binds with high 
affinity  to both human and cy nomolgus monkey  ENPP3 and that it does not cross react with 
other ENPP family  members. Moreover, treatment with AGS -16C3F produces potent cellular 
cytotox icity in vitro and regression or long term growth inhibition of well -established tumors 
in vivo .

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5AGS -16C3F inhibited tumor growth in 3 different ccRCC xenograft models. While AGS -
16M8F, the h ybridoma cell line -derived version of the same ADC studied earlier, was shown 
to bind to basophils from human and monkey , in vitro experiments showed no histamin e 
release upon incubation of human or cy nomolgus monkey  blood with AGS -
16M8F. Moreover, there were no signs of allergic reactions to AGS -16M8F in cy nomolgus 
monkey s treated with doses up to 6 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks. Likewise, no overt kidney  
toxicities we re observed.
Please refer to the confidential AGS -16C3F Investigator’s Brochure for further details.
AGS -16C3F Non -clinical Toxicology and Pharmacokinetics
A comprehensive non -clinical safet y assessment package was conducted for AGS -16M8F, 
the fully  huma n hybridoma -derived monoclonal antibody  conjugated to MMAF.  A summary  
of findings from these studies can be found in the I nvestigator Brochure. 
Based on biological characterization and analy tical testing of the CHO -derived product ,
AGS -16C3F, it was show n to be similar to AGS -16M8F.  To supplement these results, a non -
clinical bridging stud y was conducted in primates comparing the pharmacokinetic and 
toxicology  properties of AGS -16M8F and AGS -16C3F at a dose level of 6 mg/kg 
(established NOAE L dose for AG S-16M8F in the non -human primate study ).  
Administration of AGS -16C3F by  once -weekl y intravenous ( IV)infusion for 4 weeks was 
well tolerated in cy nomolgus monkey s at levels of 6 mg/kg/week.  There were no differences 
noted between AGS -16M8F and AGS -16C3F for in -life toxicology  parameters assessed in 
this study .
There were AGS -16C3F -related changes in a number of hematology  (decreased platelets and 
increased monocy tes) and clinical chemistry  parameters (increased ALT, AST, L DH, ALP, 
GGT (Gamma Glutamy l Tra nsferase) , globulin, and total protein and decreased albumin and 
A:G ratio).  In general, the magnitude of these changes was similar for AGS -16M8F and 
AGS -16C3F treated male and female animals.  The changes returned to baseline following 
recovery  and did n ot correlate with clinical signs or histopathology , and were therefore not 
considered adverse. 
Toxicokinetic data for AGS -16C3F and AGS -16M8F were considered similar based on the 
pre-specified comparability  criteria.  
Microscopic findings related to AGS -16C3F at terminal sacrifice were present in the liver 
and seminal vesicle, and microscopic findings related to AGS -16M8F and AGS -16C3F were 
present in the uterus.  None of these changes were present in recovery animals.  I n the liver of 
AGS -16C3F males, mi nimal to moderate focal to multifocal dilation of the hepatic sinusoids 
was present, and correlated with increased liver weight, but the biological significance was 
unknown since there were no clinical or clinical pathology  correlates.  A mild increase in 
cellular apoptosis and mitotic figures was present in the seminal vesicle of the only sexually 
mature male dosed with AGS -16C3F.  Minimal to moderate increases in cellular apoptosis 
and/or mitotic figures were present in the uterus (endometrial glandular e pithelium) of most 
females treated with AGS -16M8F or AGS -16C3F.  The increase in cellular apoptosis and

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5mitotic figures was an expected effect based on the intended activity of the drug pay load 
(MMAF) to inhibit microtubule formation.   
Overall, the toxic ity and TK characteristics of AGS -16M8F and AGS -16C3F when given at a 
comparable dose b y IV infusion once weekl y for 4 weeks to cynomolgus monkeys were 
comparable.  
Nonclinical Summary of mcMMAF
The safet y of the primary metabolite of AGS -16C3F, Cy s-mcMMA F, was evaluated in 
several studies described in the AGS -16C3F Investigator’s Brochure. C ys-mcMMAF was not 
found to be genotoxic in a standard battery  of assay s; however, no embry o-fetal toxicity  data 
is currentl y available. MMAF is a tubulin inhibitor and has the same mechanism of action as 
monomethy l auristatin E (MMAE) ,which has been shown to be genotoxic and embry otoxic .
As a precautionary  measure, it is recommended that males and females continue to use 
contraception for 6 months after taking the last dose of AGS -16C3F and avoid pregnancy , 
breastfeeding and donating ova/sperm .

1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
Investigational Drug -AGS -16C3F 
1.3.1.1 Development History and Background
One Phase 1 AGS -16C3F -12-2 study  evaluated the safet y and pharmacokinetics of 
AGS -16C3F given by IV infusion over 60 minutes every  3 weeks to subjects with metastatic 
RCC of either clear cell or papillary  histology .  The study  started at a bridging dose identified 
from an earlier metastatic RCC Phase 1 study  in which the target antibody (AGS -16M8F)
was manufactured from a hy bridoma cell line.  AGS -16M8F and AGS -16C3F demonstrated 
highl y similar anal ytical results, comparable biological characteristics, and similar 
pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological profiles.  The AGS -16M8F Phase 1 stu dy 
closed for enrollment without reaching the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to transition the 
compound development to AGS -16C3F.  The highest dose tested in the AGS -16M8F study  
was 4.8 mg/kg, which was the starting dose for protocol AGS -16C3F -12-2.  
1.3.1.2 AGS -16C3F Phase 1 Study (Protocol AGS -16C3F -12-2)
Overall, 34 subjects were treated in protocol AGS -16C3F -12-2 in 4dose cohorts and the dose 
that was determined to be the recommended Phase 2 dose was 1.8 mg/kg. 
The study  is complete , and the safet y information is as follows .    
All subjects in the study  experienced at least 1treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), 
many  of which were attributable to the underl ying disease. Three (3) dose limiting toxicities
(DLT) were observed at the 4.8 and 3.6 mg/kg dose le vels. Two (2) subjects at 4.8 mg/kg 
experienced a DLT of Grade 3 keratitis ,and Grade 2 leukoencephalopath y and Grade 3 fall. 
One ( 1)subject at 3.6 mg/kg had a Grade 4 thrombocy topenia DLT.

Comparator Drug -Axitinib ( Inlyta®)
Axitinib is an oral kinase inhibitor which has the chemical name N-methy l-2-[3-((E)2-pyridin -2-
yl-vinyl)-1H-indazol -6-ylsulfany l]-benzamide. Axitinib has been shown to inhibit receptor 
tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) -1, VEGFR -2, 
and VEGFR -3 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic 
angiogenesis , tumor growth, and cancer progression. VEGF -mediated endothelial cell 
proliferation and survival were inhibited by axitinib in vitro and in mouse models. Axitinib was 
shown to inhibit tumor growth and phosphorylation of VEGFR -2 in tumor xenograft mouse 
models [Axitinib U.S. Package Insert (Pfizer Labs), Aug 2014].
Most frequent adverse reactions from a pooled dataset of 672 patients who received axitinib 
in clinical studies for the treatment of RCC were as follows: diarrhea (55%), hypertension 
(51%), fatig ue (45%), dec reased appetite (39%), nausea, weight decrease and dy sphonia 
(33% each), hand -foot s yndrome (32%), hemorrhage (26%), h ypoth yroidism (25%), 
vomiting (24%), proteinuria (21%),constipation and cough (20% each).  
Detailed information on the toxic ity associated with axitinib can be found within the Package

subjects enrolled in the Phase 1 and 2 Studies of brentuximab vedotin, 15 -21% of those who 
received cetuximab and about 40% of those who received trastuzumab ( Hong et al , 2012 , 
Younes et al , 2012 , Younes et al, 2010 , Schwartzberg et al, 2009 ,).  Mild -to-moderate 
infusion reactions may  include pruritus, rash, bronchospasm, fever and chills.  More severe 
infusion related reactions might include h ypotension and shock.
Hematopoi etic toxicity , predominantly  expressed as neutropenia, is a common complication 
of several ADCs, including vedotin -(Youne s et al , 2012 , Younes et al , 2010 ), emtansine -
(Burris et al , 2011 ) and ozogamicin -conjugates ( Advani et al , 2010 , Larson et al, 2005 ).  
ADCs are also reported to cause isolated thrombocytopenia as reported as a DLT b y 
trastuzumab -DM1.  The pathogenesi s is unknown ( Krop et al , 2010 ).  
Neuropath y is described as a complication of most tubulin inhibitor -based ADCs ( Younes et 
al, 2012 , Burris et al , 2011 , Younes et al , 2010 , Swain et al , 2008 ) although it has not 
emerged so far in the ongoing Phase 1 stud y using AGS -16C3F .  
Monoclonal antibodies and ADCs can also be associated with the development of antibodies 
(Hughes, 2010 , Lambert et al , 2005 ).  
Finally , corneal lesions are an emerging toxicity , reported in subjects treated with auristatin 
F-or DM4 –conjugated ADC ( Coiffier et al , 2011 ).
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment
The recommended Phase 2 dose from the completed Study  AGS -16C3F -12-2was 1.8 mg/kg 
administered once every  3 weeks.  Thirteen (13) subjects were enrolled at this dose level.  
At this dose and frequency, durable anti -tumor effects ( Partial Response [PR] and Stable 
Disease [SD] ) were observed.  Three (3) subjects achieved durable PR (3/13, 23%), 9/13 
subjects had SD (69%), and 1/13 subject had PD (8%).  
The median treatment duration for the 13 subjects who were enrolled at 1.8 mg/kg is 17.7 
weeks (9.3 -143.1 weeks).  
The compound’s primary unique toxicity  is ocular toxicities. At the 1.8 mg/kg dose level , 
reversible ocular toxicities were reported from all but one subject (12/13, 92%) but only 2 
subjects (15%) experienced Grade 3 even ts.  No Grade 4 ocular toxicities were reported.
Another common toxicity of this compound is thrombocy topenia.  One subject (7.7%) at the 
1.8 mg/kg dose level experienced a Grade 3 thrombocytopenia.  
Refer to Section 1.3.1.2 for other frequentl y reported AEs from Study AGS -16C3F -12-2.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 52 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DESIGN AND ENDPOINTS
2.1 Study Objectives
Primary 
To evaluate the Progression Free Survival (PFS), based on investigator radiologic review, of 
AGS -16C3F compared to axitinib in subject s with metastatic RCC
Secondary 
To evaluate the following for AGS -16C3F compared against axitinib:
oPFS per RECI ST v1.1 by blinded central radiology  assessment 
oObjective Response Rate (ORR) based on the investigator’s radiographic 
assessment
oDuration of Response (DOR) based on the investigator’s radiographic assessment
oOverall Survival (OS)
oDisease Cont rol Rate (DCR) based on the investigator’s radiographic assessment
oSafety
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AGS -16C3F
To evaluate the incidence of antidrug antibod y formation to human native antibody 
(AGS -16C3) and antibody  drug conjugate (AGS -16C3F).
2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
Study Design
This multi -center, open -label , randomized study  will enroll subjects with metastatic RCC of 
all histologies who have evidence of progression on or after the last regimen received and 
have also received at least 2prior sy stemic regimens 1of which is an anti -VEGF agent (clear 
cellsubjects ). 
Non-clear cell RCC is a heterogeneous group of tumors ty picall y not driven by von Hippel -
Lindau (VHL) gene and sensitivity  to anti -VEGF treatments differ from that shown in cl ear 
cell RCC.   Hence, s ubjects with non -clear cell histology  are only required to have progressed 
on or after onl y at least one anti -VEGF regimen.  
Subjects with non -clear cell histology  must also have ENPP3 positive immunohistochemical 
(IHC) staining at prescreening.  Positivity  is defined as an IHC H -score ≥ 15.  Non -clear cell
subjects wh ose tissue has an IHC H -score of ≥ 15 will qualify  to screen for the study .  
Clear cell subjects are not required to be screened for ENPP3 to qualify  forthe study , but 
subjects must submit tissue during the study for retrospective target expression assessment by 
IHC. 
Subjects will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to either AGS -16C3F or axitinib.  Randomization 
will be stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG )Performance

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Status (0 or 1), the number of prior s ystemic RCC regimens (2 or > 2),and RCC histology  
(clear cell or non -clear cell).  
For stratification purpose:
Non-clear cell subjects who have progressed after only  one prior anti -VEGF regimen 
will be regarded the same as those clear cell subjects who have progressed after 2 prior 
systemic RCC regimens. 
Non-clear cell subjects who have progressed after > 1 prior systemic RCC regimens will 
be regarded the same as those clear cell subjects who have progressed after > 2 prior 
systemic RCC regimens. 
AGS -16C3F will be administered at 1.8 mg/kg as a single 60 -minute IV infusion once every  
3 weeks. 
Axitinib is a comme rcial product and will be administered as defined in its product label.  
Axitinib will have a starting dose of 5 mg ,twice daily  continuousl y, by mouth .  Axitinib dose 
may be adjusted during the study  as needed as defined in the product label and local 
institutional guidelines, in doses ranging from 2 to 10 mg ,twice daily  continuously , by 
mouth .
Subjects will be eligible to continue receiving treatment on study  until disease progression
per RECI ST v.1.1 , unacceptable toxicity , investigator’s d ecision, or stud y withdrawal.  
Subjects will also be discontinued from treatment if a significant non -compliance occurs 
(e.g., those that compromise study  objectives or subject safet y), or if a subject is lost to 
follow -up.  The stud y may also be terminate d by the Sponsor for any  reason.  Refer to 
Section 6for details .
Disease assessments will be performed every  8 weeks (± 7 day s) counting from C1D1.  Bone 
imaging will be performed every  12 weeks (± 7 day s) counting from C1D1 (only  subjects 
with bone disease at screening).
Those subjects who discontinue d the study  for reasons other than objective disease 
progression b y RECI ST v.1.1 will continue to have disease ass essment s every  8 weeks 
(± 7 day s)counting from C1D1. This will continue until subject has radiologically  confirmed 
progression, initiates a new therap y, stud y closure or subject dies. 
The study  will have an Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC) o verseeing the 
study .  The IDMC will conduct safet y reviews at predetermined timesduring the stud y to 
make a recommendation for continuation of recruitment, protocol modification or study  
discontinuation for safet y reasons.   
A separate IDMC Charter will specify  the governance and conduct of the IDMC. Refer to 
Section 7.8for IDMC composition and additional details.

the product label and local institutional guidelines, in doses ranging from 2 to 10 mg, twice 
daily  continuousl y, by mouth .  Drug to be used without further modification.
4.2 Pack aging and Labeling
Each vial of AGS -16C3F Drug Product (DP) is supplied as a single -use, sterile , preservative -
free, l yophilized product (30 mg) in 20 mL glass vials to be stored refrigerated ( 2-8°C).  Six 
(6) individually  labeled vials will be packaged in a labeled carton for this study .  AGS -16C3F 
will be supplied to site pharmacy  in the necessary quantity  as a site suppl y (i.e., supply  is not 
subject specific). 
Axitinib will be provided to subjects for the study  in its original packaging with a study  label 
affixed.  Axitinib will be dispensed in a whole bottle unit to each subject. Axitinib shoul d be 
stored at room temperature (20 -25 °C).
Refer to separate Pharmacy  Guide for details.
4.3 Study Drug Handling 
For this protocol, the term “study  drug” refers to both AGS -16C3F and axitinib, unless 
otherwise specified.
Current ICH GCP Guidelines require th e investigator to ensure that study  drug deliveries 
from the Sponsor are received by  the investigator and
that such deliveries are recorded,
that study  drug is handled and stored according to labeled storage conditions,
that study  drug hasan appropriate e xpiry  date and is only  dispensed to study  subjects in 
accordance with the protocol, and
that any  unused study  drug is destroy ed per local pharmacy  SOP with appropriate 
destruction documentation or returned to the Sponsor designated vendor. 
Drug inventory  and accountability  records for the study  drugs will be kept by  the 
investigator. Stud y drug accountability throughout the study  must be documented and 
reconciled. The following guidelines are therefore pertinent:
The investigator agrees not to supply  study drugs to any  persons except the eligible 
subjects in this study  in accordance with the protocol.
The investigator will keep the study  drugs in a pharmacy  or other locked and secure 
storage facility  under controlled storage conditions, accessible only  to those authorized 
by the investigator to dispense these test drugs.
A study  drug inventory  will be maintained by  the investigator. The inventory  will 
include details of material received and a clear record of when they  were dispensed and 
to which subject.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Atthe conclusion or termination of this study , the investigator agrees to conduct a final 
drug suppl y inventory and to record the results of this inventory  on the Drug 
Accountability  Record. It must be possible to reconcile delivery  records with those of 
used and/or destro yed/returned medication. An y discrepancies must be accounted for 
and documented. Appropriate forms of deliveries and returns must be signed by  the site 
staff delegated this responsibility .
At the end of the stud y or after product expiry, wi th Sponsor approval, the site will 
destroy  unused study  drugs per local pharmacy  SOP with appropriate destruction 
documentation .  If local destruction is not possible, contact the Sponsor for alternate 
destruction arrangements. 
Refer to Pharmacy  Guide fo r details.
4.4 Assignment and Allocation
Randomization will be performed via Interactive Response Technology  (IRT). After the 
subject has completed screening and the eligibility worksheet process, t he site staff will 
access the study ’s IRT system for subject r andomization ≤ 5 day s before C1D1 . The IRT 
system will not allow randomization to occur if it has been more than 28 day s since the main 
ICF has been signed. Specific procedures for randomization through the I RT are described in 
the study ’s IRT manual .
Subjects will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to either AGS -16C3F or axitinib.  Randomization 
will be stratified according to ECOG Performance Status (0 or 1), the number of prior 
systemic RCC regimens (2 or > 2) and RCC histology  (clear cell or non -clear cell).  
The RCC histology  categorization is defined as the following:
Clear cell group:
oClear cell
oClear cell component
oMixed clear cell
Non-clear cell group:
oPapillary  and every thing else*
* everything else: chromophobe, collecting duct, renal medullary, etc., n ot so common but

date from the current actual dosing date). If for logistical reasons (e.g., public holidays, clinic 
scheduling, etc.) the next dose cannot be given 21 days from the last dose, a -2 day  and a +7 
day dosing window is allowed. This window is intended to accommodate occasional 
scheduling conflicts and is not intended for routine use.  The Medical Monitor must be 
consulted for an y dose delay s that are due to toxicity  and for dose intervals that exceed 5 
weeks.  Refer to Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.1.3 .
5.1.1.1.1 AGS -16C3F Infusion Related Adverse Events
Of the 34 subjects in the Phase 1 study  (AGS -16C3F -12-2), 7/34 (20.6%) experienced an 
infusion related reaction; all were mild in severit y (Grade 1/2). At the 1.8 mg/ kg dose, 3/13 
(23.1%) reported an infusion related reaction; 2 were Grade 1 and 1 was Grade 2. All 
infusion related reactions were effectivel y managed with medication and no subject 
discontinued study  due to infusion reaction.
The antibody  moiet y of this A DC is fully  human and immune problems (e.g., anaphy lactoid 
reactions) with ADCs of such type are rare.
5.1.1.1.2 AGS -16C3F Infusion Related Adverse Event Treatment Guidelines
The initial infusion should be administered, without premedication and the total prescribed
dose should be administered over 60 minutes , including flush of the line. After completion
of the infusion ,subject sshould be observed for signs of toxicity  as necessary  and 
appropriate.  It is recommended that each subject be observed for 1hour after the first 
infusion. Observation time for subsequent infusion sshould be determined atInvestigator 
discretion.
The following guidelines are recommended courses of action that the investigator should 
consider in an event of an infusion related reaction with AGS -16C3F administration.
Investigator may , in addition, follow his/her own institutional or local infusion reaction 
management guideline s:

5.2 Study Assessments and Procedures
Tissue for Target Expression IHC Testing
All subjects are required to submit tumor tissue for target expression assessment by IHC in 
the study .  At least 5 tumor tissue sections (4 microns thick) or a tumor block must be 
provided for the assay .  If no archive tissue is available, the subject may  elect to have a 
biopsy  performed to obtain tissue.   
Non-Clear Cell S ubjects
Tumor tissue, from primary  or metastatic site (excluding bone), will be submitted to the 
Sponsor -designated CLIA certified laboratory  for ENPP3 determination by  IHC.  An IHC 
H-score of ≥ 15 is required for non -clear cell subjects to qualify  for stud y screening.  IHC 
H-scores for ENPP3 eligibility  will not expire for the duration of the stud y (i.e., there is no 
time limit from prescreen qualification to screening start).
Every  effort will be made to report the IHC H -score t o the investigator ≤72 hours of sample 
receipt at the Sponsor -designated CLIA certified laboratory  provided that the specimens were 
received in good condition along with all required documents fully completed.  Refer to 
Study  Guide for details.
Clear Cell Subjects
Clear cell histology  subjects are not required to be screened for target expression to qualify  
for the stud y, however, the source and availability of archive tissue must be confirmed to 
meet study  eligibility  criteria (Inclusion #6).  Tissue shou ld be submitted for IHC testing 
< 3 months from main study  consent form signature date.  Consent to provide tissue is

will be batch assay ed during the study .  The IHC H -score will be reported back to the 
investigator for information only  when the data become available.
Prescreening Period
Prescreening of target expression testing is onl y required for non -clear cell subjects.  Refer to 
details in Section 5.2.1 .  Non -clear cell subjects must sign a prescreening informed consent 
form to obtain and submit tissue for the study and be prescreened for ENPP3 expression prior 
to und ergoing screening procedures for the main study.  Onl y those with an IHC H -score 
≥ 15 qualify  to proceed with screening. A copy  of all signed and dated informed consent 
forms must be given to the subject before an y study  specific procedure is performed.   
Screening Period
All subjects with RCC of clear cell histology  and subjects with RCC of non -clear cell 
histology  who have received an IHC H -score of ≥ 15 are eligible for screening.
All subjects who are eligible to screen will sign the main study  ICF ≤ 28 days of C1D1 . A 
copy  of all signed and dated informed consent forms must be given to the subject before an y 
study  specific procedure is performed. Subjects may  undergo study  screening procedures 
prior to giving informed consent provided they are considere d standard of care.

TNM classifica tionand disease stage at screening
Metastasis diagnosis date
Dates and t ype of previous therap y for RCC
Other disease specific information as designated in the eCRF
5.4 Pharmacok inetics Assessment
The PK data for ADC and MMAF will be anal yzed using noncompartmental method. 
Parameters to be assessed will include concentrations at the end of infusion or maximum 
observed concentration (C EOI or Cmax), concentrations at trough (C trough ), time to maximum 
observed concentration (T max), partial area under th e conce ntration time curve (AUCτ) for 
Cycle 1 and 4, and either terminal or apparent terminal half -life (t 1/2) as appropriate. 
Additionally , clearance (CL ) and volume of distribution at steady  state (V ss) will be included 
as appropriate. Descriptive statis tics will be provided for the PK parameter estimates and 
subject concentration plots over time may be generated. Additional model -based anal yses 
may be performed and reported separatel y.
5.5 Efficacy Assessment
Response and progression will be evaluated in thi s study  using RECIST v.1.1, refer to 
Appendix 12.6.  Investigator’s radiographic disease assessment will be used for treatment 
decisions.
Disease assessments will be performed every  8 weeks (± 7 day s) counting from C1D1.  Bone 
imaging will be performed every  12 weeks (± 7 day s) counting from C1D1 (only  subjects 
with bone disease at screening).
Those subjects who discontinue dthe study  for re asons other than objective disease

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5days)counting from C1D1 . This will continue until subject has radiologically confirmed 
progression, initiates a new therap y, study  closure or subject dies.
Scans will be read on site .
CT scan with contrast (chest , abdomen, and pelvis ) is the preferred modality  for tumor 
assessment. MRI  is acceptable if local standard practice, or CT scans are contraindicated in a 
subject (e.g., subjec t is allergic to contrast media). All other RECI ST-approved scanning 
methods such as x -ray are optional. PET -CT scans must use contrast. The modality  chosen 
for the subject must be used throughout the stud y. 
Additional instructions for imaging assessment s can be found in the stud y guide. The
assessment will include tumor measurements for target lesions, nontarget lesions ,and an y 
new lesions. An overall assessment will be characterized for a given time point evaluation. At 
the end of stud y for that subjec t, the best overall response to the study  regimen will be 
characterized. To ensure comparability, the screening and subsequent assessment of response 
should be performed using identical techniques. The same individual should assess images 
for an y 1 subject for the duration of the study  if possible. 
For subjects with known treated stable brain metastases at study  entry , it is recommended that 
repeat imaging also include the brain and the same methods used to detect brain lesions at 
baseline are to be used t o follow the lesions throughout the study . 
Per RECI ST v1.1, lesions that cannot be accurately  measured such as bone lesions and 
previously  radiated lesions should not be selected as measurable lesions.   
Confirmation scans for CR or PR should be done at the next scheduled assessment. The site 
of disease progression as well as target or nontarg et lesion should be documented i n the 
eCRF. Additional imaging may  be performed at any  time to confirm suspected progression of 
disease.   
Evaluation of Target Lesio ns
5.5.1.1 Complete Response (CR)
CR is defined as disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions. An y pathological l ymph 
nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm from 
baseline measurement.
5.5.1.2 Partial Response (PR)
PR is def ined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (longest for nonnodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) of target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum 
of diameters.
5.5.1.3 Stable Disease (SD)
SD is defined as neither sufficient decrease to qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify  
for progressive disease taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study  drug.

-CONFIDENTIAL -
12 Aug 2020 Astellas Page 61of 115
Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 55.5.1.4 Progressive Disease (PD)
PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters (longest for nonnoda l 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum 
on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study ). In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an ab solute increase of at least 5 
mm. The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of nontarget lesions, there must be an 
overall level of substantial wo rsening in nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR of target lesions, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. A modest increase in the size of 1 or more nontarget lesions is 
usually  not suf ficient to qualify  for unequivocal progression.
5.5.2.1 Complete Response (CR)
For CR of nontarget lesions, subjects must have disappearance of all nontarget lesions and all 
lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
5.5.2.2 NonCR/NonPD
NonCR/NonPD of nontarget lesions is defined as persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesions.
5.5.2.3 Progressive Disease (PD)
PD of nontarget lesions is defined as unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions or 
the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.
Evaluation of Ti me Point Response
The overall response status at each time point for subjects with measurable disease at 
baseline will be reported according to Table 1 in Appendix 12.6.
5.6 Safety Assessment
Vital Signs
Measurements consisting of blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and temperature will 
be collected throughout this trial. Vital signs will be collected according to the schedule 
display ed in Table 1.
For subjects randomized to AGS -16C3F, on the day s of study  drug administration, vital 
signs will be taken predose, and approximately 30 minutes after admini stration of study  
drug

prescribed dose has been administered (e.g., 2h after the end of infusion) .
For subjects randomized to axitinib, on C1D1, the ECGs will be taken predose (anytime 
predose on actual dosing day) only.
Ocular Assessments
A complete ey e exam will be done during screening . Subjects randomized to AGS -16C3F ,
will have a complete ey e exam done after the C ycle 2 Day  1 dose but before the Cy cle 3 Day  
1 dose, after the Cy cle 5 Day  1 dose but before the Cy cle 6 Day  1 dose, and as clinically  
indicated. Subjects randomized to axitinib, will have a complete ey e exam done post baseline 
as clinically  indicated. The frequency  of ophthalmology  follow -ups outside of protocol 
requirement is at the discretion of the Investigator and ophthalmologist.
The ophthalmolog ist will complete a stud y provided cover form, capturing all pertinent 
information, and submit it along with the ophthalmology  report to the investigator.   Please 
see the Study  Guide for the form and forcomplete instructions.
At the screening (baseline) ophthalmology  visit, the complete eye exam will consist of Visual 
Acuity  with Snellen Chart , best corrected visual acuity (BCVA ), intraocular pressure ( IOP), 
extraocular movement ( EOM ), pupils, external exam, slit lamp exam, and dilated 
fundoscopic exam.
For post baseline ophthalmology  visits, the complete ey e exam will be the same as the 
baseline visit, but the dilated fundoscopic exam may be deferred if not clinically  indicated 
(i.e., if there is no change in vision or if the vision change can be explaine d as a non -retinal 
event). If deferred, an undilated fundoscopic exam is still required as part of the full eye 
exam.
The Schirmer’s test (with and without anesthetic) is optional if subject has dry eyes at 
screening (baseline) .
5.6.5.1 Symptom Based Ocular AEs
Ocular s ymptoms reported by  the subject during clinic visits will be graded per CTCAE 
v4.03 (i.e., sy mptom based assessment) and this will guide the treatment decision for that 
visit and the necessity for a follow up ophthalmology  consult.  
An EyeSymptom Questionnaire (ESQ) will be administered at every  visit in the oncology  
clinic. Please see the Study  Guide for the form and for complete instructions . During 
screening, the ESQ will be completed for both Cancer Treatment History and Screening 
sections.
The ocular s ymptom AEs must be collected in the eDC sy stem.

5.6.5.2 Clinical Ocular Adverse Events (AE)
Clinical Ocular AEs are objective findings (e.g., keratitis, macular edema, retinal 
degeneration) from the ophthalmology  evaluation. 
Clinical Ocular AE grading will be determined based on visual acuit y (VA) change from 
screening (baseline).
This will be done as follows:
Step 1. Determine baseline VA for each ey e. Subject should have the VA measured 
with or without gla sses depending on the subject’s requirement for dail y use 
for distance vision. Use Table 12and identify  the row of the baseline vision 
for each ey e.
Step 2. Subsequent ey e exam VA (obtained under same conditions as screening 
[baseline]), determine if a change in vision is present. If so, use the row in 
Table 12identifie d in Step 1, to locate the current VA and determine the 
number of line -of-vision -change from baseline for each ey e; this is expressed 
as the number in parenthesis. Also note the grade of the VA for each ey e.  
Step 3. Between the two ey es, determine the ey e with g reater line -of-vision -change 
from baseline (delta).  The Clinical Ocular AE grade for the subject is the 
grade of the worse (delta) ey e. See examples 1 and 2 in Table 11. In the event 
both ey es have the same delta, then the Clinical Ocular AE grade comes from 
the ey e with the worse new vision. See example 3 in Table 11.

5.7 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and whic h does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
This definition is broadened in this study  to include any  such occurrence (e.g., sign, 
symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of pre -existing medical condition.  Worsening indicates 
that the pre-existing medical condition has increased in severit y, frequency , or duration of the 
condition or an association with significantl y worse outcomes. 
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic surgery ) or medical 
procedures that w ere planned before stud y enrollment are not considered AEs.
Some countries may  have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE.  I n these cases, it is the 
investigator’s resp onsibility  to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriatel y recorded in the eCRF accordingl y.  
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysicalexam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets one of the 
following criteria:
Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
Requires active intervention
Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  medication
The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically  significant in the opinion of the 
investigator.
Disease progression should not be reported as an AE.  Rather signs and s ymptoms associated 
with disease progression should be reported.
All AEs occurring after the first dose of investigat ional product observed by the investigator 
or reported b y the subject (whether or not attributed to investigatio nal product), will be 
reported i n the eCRF .  AEs will continue to be reported in the eCRF until 28 day s post last 
dose, or at the subject’s Safe ty Follow -Up visit, whichever occurs later. SAEsand medicall y 
significant AEs considered related to the investigational prod uct b y the investigator or the

12 Aug 2020 Astellas Page 69of 115
Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable.  If a treatment -related adverse 
event is not resolved but is considered stable at the safet y follow -up visit, this must be 
documented in the source documents.  
The following attributes must be assigned b y the investigator:  description; dates of onset and 
resolution; severity ; assessment of r elatedness to investigational product, action taken, 
serious status and criteria.
It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an AEis of sufficient 
severit y to require the subject’s removal from treatment. However, the Medical M onitor will 
be consulted prior to the subject being discontinued from study  for safet y reasons.     
Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any  of the fo llowing outcomes: 
Results in death
Is life threatening (an AEis considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
Requ ires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious) 
Other medicall y important events
Medical and scientific judgment should be exerc ised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Safety  events of interest on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study (e.g., stud y drug, comparator, background therap y) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
Inadvertent or accide ntal exposure to the medicinal product(s)

Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name confusion)
Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
AEs that fall under e ither "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as " AEs whose 
relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out".
Causal relationship 
to the study drugCriteria for causal relationship
Not RelatedA clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
temporal  relationship to drug administration which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and/or in  which other drugs, chemicals or 
underly ing disease provide plausible explanations.
PossibleA clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may  be lacking or 
unclear.
ProbableA clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikel y to be 
attributed to concurrent disease or  other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically reasonable response on re -administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).
Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
All AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, will be graded using the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) -Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Event ( CTCAE) 
guidelines (Version 4.03). 
5.7.4.1 Study Specific Ocular Toxicity Grading Criteria
Refer to Section 5.6.5 .
Reporting Procedures for All Serious Adverse Events (S AEs)
All SAEs occurring after the first dose of investigational product observed by the investigator 
or reported b y the subject (whether or not attributed to investigational product), will be 
reported to the sponsor .  SAEs considered related to the investi gational product by  the 
investigator or the Sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable.  
All SAEs that occur up to the last formal follow -up observational period ,must be reported 
≤1 working day  of discovery  or notification of the event .  
In the case of a SAE, the investigator must contact the sponsor by  faxor email immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness).
The investigator must complete and submit a SAE worksheet containing all information that 
is required b y local and/or regional regulations to the sponsor by email or fax immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness).

Follow -up of Advers e Events
SAEs and medicall y significant AEs considered related to the investigational product b y the 
investigator or the Sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable.  
If a treatment -related adverse event is not resolved but is considered stable at the safet y 
follow -up visit, this must be documented in the source documents.  
Please refer to Appendix 12.2 for detailed instructions on Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI).
Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events
Common serious adverse events are SAEs commonly  anticipated to occur in the study  
population independent of drug exposure. SAEs classified as “common” are provided in 
Appendix 12.3 for y our reference. The list does NOT change y our reporting obligations or 
prevent the need to report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE as detailed above. The 
purpose of this list is to alert y ou that some events reported as SAEs may  not require 
expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities based on the classification of “common 
SAEs ” as specified in Appendix 12.3.The Sponsor will monitor these events throughout the 
course of the stud y for any change in frequency .Any changes to this list will be 
communicated to the participating investigational site s. Investigators must report individual 
occurrences of these events as stated in Section 5.7.5 .
Procedure in Case of Pregnancy
If a female subject or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the study  dosing 
period or ≤6 months from the discontinuation of dosing, the investigator should report the 
information to the Sponsor as if it isanSAE. The expected date of delivery or expected date 
of the end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy  result 
and neonatal data etc., should be included in this information.
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the 
pregnancy  is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor.
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAEs ( spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y [includin g anomaly  in a 
miscarried fetus ]), the inves tigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure 
for SAEs. Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy (which is 
categorized as an SAE) is mentioned below.
"Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abort ion
Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug
If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterin e exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible "by 
the investigator
In the case of a delivery  of a living newborn, the "normality "of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5investigator is also free to terminate a subject's involvement in the study  at any  time if the 
subject's clinical condition warrants it.
If a subjec t is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing AEor an unresolved laboratory  
result that is significantl y outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to 
provide follow -up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically  signif icant. 
The subject will be discontinued from treatment if any  of the following occurs:
Subject develops objective disease progression per RECI ST v.1.1 criteria based on 
investigator assessment.
Subject develops clinical progression (if objective disease p rogression is not evaluated).
Subject develops a Grade 4 or unacceptable AEas assessed b y the Investigator (Refer 
also to Section 5.6.2.1.3 andSection 5.6.5.2.1 )
Investigator decides that it is in the subject’s best interest to discontinue.
Subject declines further study  participation (i .e., study  withdrawal ).
A significant protocol deviation or non -compliance occurs with a subject that 
compromises study  objectives or subject safet y.
Subject is lost to follow -up despite reasonable efforts by  the Investigator to locate the 
subject.
The stu dy is terminated by  the Sponsor.
The Medical Monitor must be contacted before a subject is discontinued from study  treatment 
for reasons other than objective disease progression per RECI ST v.1.1 .
6.2 Discontinuation of the Site
If an investigator intends to discontinue participation in the study , the investigator must 
immediately  inform the Sponso r.
6.3 Discontinuation of the Study
The Sponsor may  terminate this study  prematurely , either in its entirety  or at any  study  site, 
for reasonable cause provided that wri tten notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination . Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  concerns. If 
the Sponsor terminates the study  for safet y reasons, the Sponsor will immediately notify the 
investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for study  termination.
7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  the responsible biostatistician of Astellas . A 
Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of t he analy sis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before 
the database soft lock at the latest. An y changes from the anal yses planned in SAP will be 
justified in the Clinical Study  Report (CSR) .

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Prior to Database Lock, a Final Review of Data and TLFs Meeting will be held to allow a 
review of the clinical trial data and to verify the data that will be used for analysis set 
classification. If required, consequences for the statistical anal ysis wil l be discussed and 
documented.  A meeting to determine anal ysis set classifications may  also be held prior to 
database lock.
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency  and percentage for categorical endpoints.
7.1 Sample Size
For subjects with metastatic RCC that has progressed after at least 2 prior lines of therap y, a 
median PFS of 4 months is anticipated for the control agent.  It is hy pothesized that AGS -
16C3F will improve median PFS in such subjects by 2 months (i.e., 4 vs 6 months).  Under 
the assumption of exponential distribution of PFS, such an improvement corresponds to a 
hypothesized hazard ratio of 0.667.  If th is hy pothesized hazard ratio is true, 110 PFS events 
provide 80% power to achieve a one -sided p -value of 0.1 or smaller.  Such a result will be 
achieved when the observed hazard ratio is 0.783 or smaller; and the observed difference in 
median PFS is 1.1 mo nths or larger if the observed median for the control arm is 4 months.  
Assuming accrual of approximately  7 subjects per month for 18 months, 110 PFS events are 
projected 24 months after the date the first subject is randomized.  Approximately 134 
subjects may be enrolled to accommodate for up to 10% of subjects who may  become lost to -
follow -up.
7.2 Analysis Set
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be defined in Classification Specifications and the 
allocation of subjects to analy sis sets will be determined prior to database hard -lock. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS)
The full anal ysis set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized in accordance 
with the intention -to-treat (ITT) principle. This will be the primary  analy sis set for efficacy  
analyses. The s ubjects will be grouped for purposes of the anal ysis according to the treatment 
assigned b y the randomization, regardless of whether the subject receives the correct drug 
assignment.
Per Protocol Set (PPS)
The per protocol set (PPS) will consist of the su bset of the FAS who do not meet criteria for 
PPS exclusion. These criteria are to capture relevant non -adherence to the protocol and will 
be defined in the SAP. The sensitivity  anal ysis for the primary  and key  secondary  efficacy  
endpoints will be performed on PPS. Selected demographic and baseline characteristics may  
also be summarized for the PPS.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5
Safety Analysis Set (SAF)
The safet y analysis set (SAF) will consist of all subjects who receive at least one d ose of 
study  drug (AGS -16C3F or a xitinib), with tr eatment assignments designated according to 
actuall y study treatment received. The SAF will be used for summaries of all safet y variables.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) : AGS -16C3F Only
The pharmacokinetic analy sis set (PKAS) consists of the study  population for which 
sufficient serum concentration data is available to facilitate derivation of at least one PK 
parameter and for whom the time of dosing on the day of sampling is known. Additional 
subjects may  be excluded from the PKAS at the discretion of the pharmacokineticist. Any  
formal definitions for exclusion of subjects or time -points from the PKAS will be 
documented in the Classification Specifications and determined in the Classification Meeting. 
Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set (PDAS)
A pharmacod ynamic marker has not y et been established for this target.
7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics
Detailed information on subject demographics and other baseline characteristics will be 
reported. All baseline summary  tables will be generated b y treatment group for the FAS, PPS 
and SAF . If the anal ysis sets are identical the tables will only  be presente d only  once in the 
CSR. 
Medical History
A detailed medical history for each subject will be obtained during screening period and will 
be summarized by  treatment group for the FAS, PPS and SAF. 
Disease History
Data collected on RCC diagnosis, metastasis, histology , and additional relevant biological 
information will be summarized by  treatment group for the FAS, PPS and SAF. Each 
subject’s complete cancer history  will be listed. 
Previous and Concomitant Medications
The frequency  of prior and concomitant me dications categorized b y preferred term (PT) will 
be summarized by  treatment group for FAS, PPS and SAF. Medications will be coded using 
the WHO drug dictionary. Medications will be counted by  the number of subjects who took 
each medication. The number and percentage of subjects who received prior therapies and the 
type of therap y will also be summarized by  treatment group. 
7.4 Analysis of Efficacy 
Efficacy  anal yses will be conducted on the FAS and PPS. The FAS will be considered as 
primary  and the PPS will b e used as secondary  to assess the robustness of the results from the 
statistical analy ses based on the FAS.

survival curve and median for time -to-event variables will be es timated using the Kaplan -
Meier method and will be reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval 
(CI) calculated using Greenwood’s formula. 
For the inference comparison of the primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints between the 
treatment g roups, 2 stratification factors will be included: ECOG P erformance Status (0 or 1) 
and the number of prior systemic RCC regimen s (2 or > 2 for clear cell; 1 or > 1 for non -clear 
cell). Clear cell subjects with 2 prior lines of systemic treatment and non -clear cell subject 
with 1 prior line of sy stemic treatment will be grouped to the same stratum under the 
assumption that they  have similar prognosis. Similarly , clear cell subjects with 3 or more 
prior lines of treatment and non -clear cell subjects with 2 or more prior lines of treatment will 
be allocated to the same stratum. Histology will not be used as a stratification variable in 
inferential comparison because a limited number of non -clear cell subjects is expected to be 
enrolled in the study  (no more tha n 26 non -clear cell histology ).
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
7.4.1.1 Primary Analysis
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is progression -free survival (PFS), defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the earliest of documented disease progression as defined by 
RECI ST v 1.1 per investigator radiology  review , or death from any  cause . Disease 
assessment will continue until disease progression, even after the originall y assigned 
treatment is discontinued.  
The primary  anal ysis of investigator assessed PFS will be performed in accordance with the 
ITT principle in the FAS. All subjects who undergo randomization will be included in the 
primary  anal ysisandgrouped according to the treatment groups assigned by randomization.  
For the primary  anal ysis of PFS, the difference in treatment effect between treatment groups 
will be tested using the stratified log rank test (on ECOG P erformance Status and the number 
of prior s ystemic RCC regimen s) at a one -sided 0.1 significance level.
Estimation of the hazard ratio for treatment and its corresponding one -sided 90% CI  will be 
determined using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (on ECOG P erformance Status
and the number of prior systemic RCC regimen s), without any  other covariate. A two -sided 
95% CI  will also be reported in the clinical study  report. Homogeneity  in the hazard ratios 
between strata will be examined by Wald’s test. The corresponding results without 
stratification will be reported as supplemental analyses .The adequacy  of the model will be 
evaluated, including an assessment of the proportional hazards assumption ( Therneau, 2000 ).
For the primary  anal ysis, PFS will be right -censored for subjects who meet one or more of 
the following conditions:
Subjects with no post -baseline disease assessments unless death occurred prior to the 
first planned assessment (in which case death will be considered a PFS event)

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Subjects who initiate subsequent anti -cancer therapy  or intervention in the absence of 
documented progression
Subjects who die or have disease progression after missing 2or more consecutively  
scheduled disease assessment visits
Subjects who are last known to be alive and progression -free on or before the data cut -
off date
For such subjects, PFS will be right -censored according to the conventions described in 
Table 13. These conventions are based on the May 2007 FDA Guidance for I ndus try 
“Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics”.

7.4.1.2 Secondary Analysis
Sensitivity  analy ses will be performed to evaluate the robustness of the PFS results derived 
under the primary  anal ysis (Bhattachary a 2009 , Carroll 2007 , Stone 2011 ).  Such sensitivity  
analyses will assess potential sources of bias due to 1) differences between the planned and 
actual schedule of disease assessments, 2) censoring for sub sequent anti -cancer therap y, 
3)symptomat ic or non -radiological disease progression, and 4) missed disease assessments 
due to reasons such as protocol deviations , consent withdrawal, and subjects lost to follow -
up. The corresponding PFS results without stratification will be reported as supplemen tal 
analyses. 
The same anal yses of the primary  PFS will be conducted using the PPS.
7.4.1.3 Subgroup Analysis

treatment effects across levels of baseline characteristics such as age, gender, ECOG

will be performed for the FAS and PPS.
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Progression -free survival by  blinded central radiology  review and overall survival, defined as 
the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from an y cause, will be 
evaluated as secondary  endpoints. They  will be analy zed using the same methodology  as 
described for the primary endpoint in Section 7.4.1 as appropriate .
Best ove rall response will be tabulated for each treatment group using the crude portion of 
subjects whose best response during the course of protocol treatment is Complete Response 
(CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD) and non -
evaluable (NE). Tumor response will be determined using RECIST v 1.1. The primary  
analysis of the secondary tumor response endpoints will be based on investigator’s 
assessments; the secondary sensitivity  anal yses of these endpoints will be performed based
on the assessments b y blinded central review. A best response CR or PR must be confirmed 
no less than 28 day s after the criteria for response after first met. Disease control rate (DCR) 
will be estimated for each treatment group based on the crude proport ion of subjects who 
have a best overall response of CR, PR or SD. For DCR, SD with a minimum duration of 6
months from the date of randomization is required. Objective response rate (ORR) will be 
estimated for each treatment group based on the crude propor tion of subjects who have a best 
overall response of CR or PR. The method of Clopper and Pearson will be used to calculate 
two-sided 95% CIs for DCR and ORR, by  treatment group, both overall and within 
stratification strata.
The inferential comparison betw een treatment groups for both DCR and ORR will be made 
using the stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test at a two-sided significance level 
of 0.05. An estimate of the relative risk (RR) of not experiencing OR with a xitinib arm as the 
reference l evel will be provided as a measure of relative treatment effect. The RR and two-
sided 95% CI will be estimated using stratified Mantel -Haenszel method. Homogeneity  in 
ECOG P erformance Status by number of prior treatments strata will be examined at a 
signif icance level of 0.05 by  two-sided Breslow -Day test. Similarly , the RR of not 
experiencing DC will be estimated with its two-sided 95% CI. 
Duration of objective response (DOR) is defined as the time from the date of the first 
response of CR or PR (whicheve r is first recorded), and subsequentl y confirmed, to the first 
date of documented progressive disease or death due to an y cause. The DOR will be 
summarized descriptively using the 25th, 50thand 75thpercentile (and 95% CI ) of the Kaplan -
Meier curve for su bjects who have best overall response of confirmed CR or PR, by  
treatment group, both overall and within randomization strata. The DOR will be censored 
using the same censoring rules, whenever applicable, as PFS.
Each of the secondary  endpoints described above will be performed for the FAS and PPS. 
For the purpose of h ypothesis generation, subgroup may be performed for selected baseline 
characteristics.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 512.2 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment 
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therapy  and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN (to > 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases), 
or bilirubin > 2 × ULN, should undergo detailed testing for liver enzy mes (including at least 
ALT, AST, AL P, and TBL) . Testing should be repeated within 48 -72 hours of notification of 
the test results. For studies fo r which a central laboratory  is used, alerts will be generated b y the 
central lab regarding moderate and severe liver abnormality  to inform the investigator, study  
monitor and study  team. Subjects should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of 
hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3 x ULN (in subject s without 
liver metastases), > 5 x ULN (in 
subject s with liver metastases)or > 2 x ULN
Severe* > 3 x ULN and > 2 x ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
● ALT or AST > 8 ×ULN
● ALTor AST > 5 ×ULN for more than 2 weeks (in the absence of liver metasteses)
● ALT or AST > 3 ×ULN and INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated).
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia ( > 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring and 
follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detail ed pertinent history , phy sical 
examination and laboratory  tests . The site should complete the L iver Abnormality  eCRF (LA -
CRF) or appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should 
be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 -3 times weekly  then weekl y or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study  drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic.  
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above , in the ab sence of another 
etiology  may  be considered an important medical event and may  be reported as a Serious

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5Adverse Event (SAE). The Sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom 
severe hepatic liver function abnormalities possibly  attribut able to stud y drug are observed.
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
● Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. 
Symptoms and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘ad verse events’ on the AE 
page of eCRF. Illnesses and conditions such as hypotensive events, and 
decompensated cardiac disease that may  lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should 
be noted. Non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese 
hyperlipoprot einemic, and/or diabetic subject s and may  be associated with 
fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The investigator should ensure that the medical 
history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment that may  be relevant 
in assessing hepatic fu nction.    
● Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitan t 
medication page of the eCRF. I nformation on alcohol, other substance use, and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.
● Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
● Based on the subject’s history , other testing ma y be appropriate including: 
oacute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents). 
oultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
oother laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
● Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consul tations.
● Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or 
acute liver disease, pre sence of liver metastases, or exposure to other agents associated with 
liver injury , the subject may  be discontinued from the study . The investigator may  determine 
that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue study  enrollment. Discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered if:
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects without liver metasteses
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated)
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and (TBL > 2 ×ULN in subject s with liver metasteses)
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia ( > 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subje ct with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory  tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 5*Hy’s Law Definition -Drug -induced jaundice caused by  hepatocellular injury , without a 
significant obstructive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10–50% mor tality  
(or transplant).” The 2 “requirements” for Hy ’s Law are: (1)Evidence that a drug can cause 
hepatocellular -type injury , generall y shown b y an increase in transaminase elevations higher 
3 times the upper limit of normal (“2 x ULN elevation s are too common in treated and 
untreated subjects to be discriminating”). (2) Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 2 x ULN)

Version 6.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 512.3 Common Serious Adverse Events
The following is a list of SAEs that the Sponsor considers to be associated with the disease 
state being studied.  The list does NOT change your reporting obligations, or prevent the need 
to report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE as detailed in Section 5.7.2 . The purpose of 
this list is to alert y ou that some events reported as SAEs may  not require expedited reporting 
to the regulatory  authorities based on the classification of “common serious adverse events”. 
You are required to follow the requirements detai led in Section 5.7.5 .  
Signs/sy mptoms commonly  reported in metastatic RCC subjects often associated to disease 
progression are:
Pain
Weight loss (weight loss not considered cachexia by  investigators is excluded )
Anemia
Hypercalcemia
Proteinuria
For expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) , single 
occurrences of the above events may  be excluded from expedited reporting to regul atory  
authorities . If aggregate anal ysis of these events indicates they  occur more frequentl y with 
study  drug, an expedited safet y report may  be submitted to the regulatory  authority .

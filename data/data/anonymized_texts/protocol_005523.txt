Protocol title  Assessing Adherence to Home Telemedicine in Individuals with COPD  
Study code  COPD -MM -01 
Investig ators  M. Bradley Drummond, MD MHS  
Indication  Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD)  
Population  COPD patie nts with history of increased exacerbation risk  
Primary Objectives  Determine if patients with COPD with an increased risk of exacerbation will 
use an in -home telemonitoring system, including a home spirometer.  
Secondary Objectives  • Determine if use of an  in-home telemonitoring system, including a 
home spirometer, will reduce 30 -day readmissions due to COPD. 
• Determine if use of an in- home telemonit oring system will improve the 
Quality of Life scores.  
Study design  This is a prospective, open label trial e valuating home telemonitoring for 
patients with COPD and history of increased exacerbation risk. The 
purpose of this study is to determine whether  automated home 
monitoring of medication compliance and biometric parameters (FEV1, FVC, PIFR, IC , pulse oxime try, 
and symptoms) is acceptable to patients, can 
improve adherence, and may improve clinical outcomes and reduce avoidable 30 -day readmissions. Slow spirometry will be performed 
Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays , Fridays  and Saturdays
. Forced spirometry 
will b e performed Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The platform will:  
• Remind patients to take their medications  
• Remind p atients to perform m easurements  
• Send patients helpful information  
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 3 of 22 • Execute a UNC clinic established COPD Action Plan  
The backend of  the platform is a remote server (MTI CarePortal) that 
collects the data, send out alerts to the Principal Investigator and can 
track and trend th e data for them. It also sends out the medication and 
measurement reminders.

Safety Monitoring  As this stu dy is deemed low ris k, oversight for this f easibility study will be 
conducted by the PI (Dr. D rummond).  The PI will monitor data to ensure 
the safety of participants.   
Sample Size 
Justification  This is a techni cal evaluation intended to determine if tel ehealth 
monitoring c an be integrated into t he home monitoring of patients with 
COPD and deter mine both the acceptance and value of its use. The sample 
size is not powered or intended to establish statistically sig nificant 
differences from historic experience.  
Statistical Ana lysis The sample size o f this technical evaluation is not powered or nor intended 
to establish statistically significant differences. The adherence and 
utilization of the platform , as defined by the physiologic and QoL 
measurements , will be helpful in esta blishing guidance for f uture efficacy 
trials.  Nevertheless, descriptive characteristics of the patient s prior to, 
during, and at the end of the study will be tabulated.   
 
The study is based on two primary endpoint s, adherence to home device 
measurement collection an d baseline to Week 12 cha nge in Total Score of 
COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Home device measurement adherence is described a s percentage of participants achieving >50% completion of all 
planned device measurements (spirometry, pulse oximetry and questionnaires) over t hree months . Change in CAT score is  defined as 
percentage of participants achieving ≥2 point decrease  in CAT from 
baseline to three months . Additional secondary and explo ratory ou tcomes 
are also identified in the ful l protocol.  
 
The primary outcome will be reported as propo rtion with 95% confiden ce 
intervals. Othe r outcomes will be de scribed with  proportion and 95% 
confidence interval, rate, or descr iptive summary measures  as defined in  
the full protocol. All tests with p value < 0.05 will be interpreted nominally 
as statistically significant . In additi on, the results will be used to identify 
technologi cal deficiencies and provide data to inform the power 
requirements for future studies.

Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 8 of 22 4. Introduction   
4.1. Background   
The Hospital Readmissi ons Reduction Program  (HRRP), mandated by the Affordable C are Act/So cial 
Security Act, results in reduced Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (C MS) payments to hospitals w ith 
excess readmissions.1  The HRRP targets six conditions that contribute heavily to u nplanned 
readmissions:  heart attack, heart failure , pneum onia, Chro nic Obstructive Pulmonary Di sease (COPD) , 
hip/knee replacement, and corona ry artery bypass graft surg eries.    It is the expectation of CMS that 
hospitals cut readmissions through process improvement, specifically by improving transitions of care  
and impro ving quality of care.  One reported mechanism of improving patient care is  the use of remote 
patient monitoring (RPM) , which utilizes technology to connect patients and healthcare provider s. 
Remote patient monitoring  can improve patient co mplianc e with maintenance medications and pro vide 
targeted intervention/follow- up through s ymptom monitoring  for the s ix target conditions .   
However, for a home RPM  program to work, patients need to accep t and utilize the technology. In a 
previous  study  using th e same technology in patients with pos t-hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT),  
Sheshadri demonstrate d the feasibi lity of implementing a home spirometry program in HCT recipients 
who survive to day 100  using the same MTI platform  as proposed in this st udy.2 Study parti cipants were 
able to achieve  technical proficiency with home spirometry wi thout substantial coaching.  Agreement 
with clinic -based spirometry was acceptable, spirometric data were reproducible over time, and day -to-
day variation in measurem ents wa s small. Furthermore, they  achieved hi gh rates of adherence to the 
study protocol, w ith the majority of particip ants completing the study. They concluded that 
implementation of a home spirometry pro gram may be a cost -effective way to monitor for early 
pulm onary impa irment in HCT recipients . Th e COPD patient population may be an older grou p of 
patients with potentia lly more comorbidities and therefore it is important to understand if this 
technology c an fit in as a component of the management of patie nts wit h COPD.  
4.2. Study Design  
This is a prospective, open label trial evaluating home telemonitoring for patients with C OPD and a 
history of increased exacerbation risk. The purpose of this study is to deter mine whether automated 
home monitoring of medicatio n compliance and biometric parameters (FEV1, FVC, PIFR, IC , pulse 
oximetry,  and symptoms) i s acceptable to patients, c an improve adherence, and may improve clinical 
outcomes and reduce exacerbations and av oidable 30 -day readmissions. Slow spirometry will b e 
perfo rmed Sunda ys, Mondays, Wednesdays , Fridays  and Saturdays. Forced spirometry will be 
performed Tuesdays and Thur sday s.

7. Study Procedures:  
7.1. Patient Identification and Informed Consent  
COPD patients under care at, or referred to the UNC Hospi tals Pul monary Specialty Clinic , who meet 
the basic entry criteria will be identified  by the PI or site clinical personnel.   Once a patient is identified 
as me eting all study criteria, they will be called on the telephone by the investigator/study staff and the 
study w ill be t horoughly explained. Verbal informed consent , followin g UNC Guid elines for verbal 
consents , will be obtained  after the participant has had a chan ce to have t he consent fully ex plained , 
have all questions answered, demonstrates an understanding of the study purpose (through verbal 
discussion with consenter)  and has ag reed to participate in the study. Verba l consent to HIPAA 
requirements will also be documented.   
7.2. Study Home Equipment  
All measurement devices placed in the patient’s home are FDA cleared fo r their intended use. These 
include a home spiromet er (GoS piro®, Mon itored Therapeutics, Dublin, OH) and a finger pulse o ximeter 
(3230 Pulse Oximeter, Nonin Medical, Plymouth, MN). Both of these devices are Bluetooth capable, requiring no wires for connect ion to the GoHome ™ Personal Health Monitor data col lection  platform.  
 
The GoHome is built on a Samsung ta blet working  with the Android operating system. It is an auto -start 
system requiring no patient tablet knowledge to operate the system. Its “home” page is a clock and 
calendar with a five -day weather fo recast which is a lways kept on. At appropriate times, it will rece ive 
and di splay messages and reminders for the patient. It has a Bluetooth radio for connecting to  the 
spirometer and pulse oximeter. The G oHome  will also be used for collecting the Quality of Life  
questionn aires and for providing educational information for t he pat ient.  
 
Communication with the MTI CarePortal cloud server from the GoHome is through either Wi- Fi or its 
built -in cellular radio. Patients will not be able to access the internet f or pers onal use o n these devices, 
they will only be able to transfer data fo r the purposes of this study.   
 Eligible patients will be sent a participation ki t containing the GoHome, GoSpiro and p ulse oximeter 
following their completion of th e inf ormed con sent an d HIPAA au thorization.  A virtual (phone or video)  
appointment will be made with the patient by the  study staff to train the  patient at home how to 
operate the technology and confirm eligibility . Additional videos on th e GoHome will provide addition al 
instructions on use of the GoHome and GoSpiro.  
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 11 of 22 7.3. Study Data Platform  
Data collected from patients’ homes will be stored on the MTI C arePo rtal (S ee Section 10), a cloud  
server hosted in Dublin, Ohio. This portal will monitor all data received or expected t o be re ceived an d 
will send alerts via text and /or e-mail to the investigative team  based on pre -defined thresholds . These 
alerts will be sent fo r missed spirometry sessions as well as for spirometry which  falls below alert 
thresholds. It will also send alerts ba sed on ox ygen saturation alarm thresholds as well as missed 
medications or measurements  or changes in their CAT score . 
 
The pl atfor m will also:  
• Remind patients to take their medications  
• Remind patie nts to perform measur ements  
• Send patients helpful i nformat ion 
• Execu te a UNC  clinic established COPD Action Plan  
7.4. Study Procedure  
Patients will be enrolled in the study for up to fifteen  (15) weeks , including twelve (12) weeks  for active 
monitoring. The stud y timeline for all pr ocedures is defined in the Sec tion 17  table. All patients enrolled 
in the study, following the collection  of a verbal informed consent , will have a medical history recorde d 
by phone. Upon confirmation of basic eligibility, patients  will be sent  a telemonitoring system consisting 
of the  GoSpir o®, a pulse oximeter and  a GoHome  tablet.  A member of the Clinic research staff will 
schedule a  (virtual (phone or video)  appointment wi th the patient for when the system has arrived . The y 
will train  each patient on how to use the devices and will instruc t the patient how and when to record 
measurements. Pulse  oximetry (SpO2 and HR), as well as  slow and forced spirometry with the GoSpiro 
will be collected duri ng th is training  call. These instruction s will also be provided on patient information  
mate rial (S ee Appendi ces A and B).  P atient s should exhibit profic iency with the devices and 
demonstrate underst anding of the measurement schedule prior to ending the call . 
 
The study nurse will contact the pa tient the following day by phone to confirm that th e patie nt is able  to 
set up the GoHome and u se the devices for measurements. In the event the par ticipant is not able to 
provide and transmit satisfactory  data collection after one week ( due to technical or training reasons ) 
they will be removed from study  and re placed with another participant toward the  total recruitment 
goal .  The study nur se will call the patient every four (4) weeks to collect information  on an y changes to  
inhaled  medication , steroids or antibiotics  and assist the patient with any opera tional questions . 
Between phone calls, Clinic research staff or device manufacturer’s support personnel will be available to assist the patient should quest ions o r technical issues arise. The study n urse w ill conduct a final 
phone visit to c ollect close ou t data prior to the participant returning the devices (see Section 17).  
 Physiologic data from the patients will be transmitted automatically  following each measurement and 
will be a vailable on the CarePo rtal within a few  minute s of its collection. Physio logic data (spirometry 
and oxygen saturat ion) w ill be colle cted every day . Medication reminders, COPD Action Plan 
communications, etc. will be sent every day  if scheduled . In addition  to monitoring paramet ers, health 
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 12 of 22 teaching tip s as part of the COPD Actio n Plan will als o be incorporated into the  GoHom e software t o 
educate and motivate patients regarding self -care. A Quality of Life questionnaire (COPD Assessment 
Test) will also be col lected every 4 weeks from the patients through  the GoHome tablet.  
 
At the  end of  study  (after completion of final phone visit) , the patients will return the equipment  to UNC 
via a pre -paid FedEx air bill that has been included with the original shipment. A member of the Clinic 
research study  team will have a final call with the  patien t to check on the patient’s respiratory statu s 
and have them complete a usability questionnaire  by ph one. 
8. Quality Control Measures  
Quality control of the lung function measurements will include aut omatic ATS/ERS intra-measurement 
grading  of the forced flow-volume  loops  and slow spirometry  to ensure interpretable and actionable 
home spirometry .5 MTI will assist  with  determining the number of missed spirome try sessions with 
seven  times per week testin g, and determining any technical issues in tran smis sion of  data fr om the 
spirometer to the MTI CarePortal.  
The GoSpiro home spirometer meets the 2019 ATS/ERS criteria for accuracy and reproducibility .5 
Baseline pulmonary function will be defined as the mea n FEV1 over the first two weeks of the s tudy (s ix 
measuremen ts). If older data is available for the patient, that data may be included in establishing 
historic value s for analysis. Variability of pulmonary funct ion for alerts to Clinic staff will include a  
decrease by one personalized z -score us ing pulmona ry func tion mea surements for an individual patient 
and calculated over the length of the study as well as using hi storic data if available.  
Alerts from acute de clines in pulmonary function will be defined as any decrement in either FEV1, FVC 
or IC >10% . Oxygen sa turation  readings below 8 8% will trigger an alert. For patients being managed with 
DPI delivered inhaled drugs, monitoring of peak inspiratory flow for detection of inadequate flows  to 
aerosolize and deliver the powder, will also generate  alerts . The MTI CarePorta l will provide daily  
reports to the Clinic research staff of patient trending towards alert  levels,  as well as patients with low 
adherence to medications or measurements.  
9. Assessments  
9.1. Timing of Assessments  
See Section 17 
9.2. Clinical A ssessme nts and Int erventio ns 
9.2.1.  Patient  Charac teristics and Medical History  
Demographic information (age, gender, race) will be captured at Screening.  Relevant 
medical history, prescription drug s, including history of smoking, other pertinent history 
and informatio n regarding  underly ing diseases will be recorded at Screening.  
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 13 of 22 9.2.2.  Vital Signs  
Heart rate, respiration rate , and oxygen saturation  measurements will be performed and 
recorded after resting for 5 minutes duri ng the training call and a t the week 13 final phone 
visit. 
9.2.3.  Spirometry  
Patien ts will be performing slow spirometry measurements five  (5) times per week o n Sundays, 
Mondays, Wednesdays , Fridays  and Sa turdays . They will be performing forced spirometry 
measurements on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Measurements will be perform ed in th e morni ng at 
least 15 minutes following them taking their inhaled medications. The reliability and repeatability of 
effort depend ent tests or tests that require patients to follow specific step s, depend on patients 
understanding how to perf orm the test.  
The GoHo me comes with Avatar-Assisted- Technology to coach the patient through each m easurement . 
The Avatar follows ATS/ERS recomme ndations for instructions and coaching. At the end of each 
measu rement, the Avatar  reviews the results and inst ructs the patien t how t o correct maneuver errors. 
All of this takes place without human interventio n. Experience to date indicates that use of th e Avatar-
Assisted- Technology  results in data collection as good as from hospital PFT laboratories and better than 
from physician offic es.3  
Spirometry will be performed in accordance with the 2019  ATS/ERS recom mendations for intra-
measurement performance . To increase adherence to performing spirometry measurements, a 
Statistical Process Control approach will be use d as  recomm ended  for CO PD patients .4 This 
approach will be used for both FVC and SVC testing.  
9.2.4.  Oxyge n Saturation  
Oxygen saturation will be measure d by pulse oximetry at all clinic visits and daily while the pat ient is 
monitored at home. Oxygen saturation wi ll be me asured p rior to  the measurement of spirometry.  
9.2.5.  Quality of Life (QoL) Surveys  
The COPD Assessment T ool (CAT), a validated survey, consisting of 8 questions, each on 0 -5 Likert scale , 
will be used  to assess the patient’s health and quality of life. P atients will be asked to fill it out at 
enrollment and again at the end of weeks of 4, 8 and 12 . 
9.2.6.  Medication Adherence  
Automatic reminders will be  sent to patients on their GoHome to take medications. Patients will self-
report in response to the reminders w heth er o r not th ey took  their medications. The medication 
tracking function of the MTI CarePortal will provide report cards to patients (and optionally copied to 
healthcare providers) as to their adherence, on  each Mon day for the previous week. These remin ders  
can also be  issued  “on demand” by the healthcare providers monitoring the patients directly fr om the 
MTI CarePortal.  
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 14 of 22 9.2.7.  Measurement Adherence  
Automatic reminders will be sent to patients on their GoHome to p erform measurements. The 
measurement tracking f unction of the C arePort al will generate alerts to healthcare providers as to their 
adherence, based  on programmed alarm settings.  
9.2.8.  Incidence of Cl inical Interventions  
Clinic personnel will maintain records of any changes in clinical care, additional clinic visits o r 
hospit alizati ons during the monitoring period. These will be used to determine the effect iveness of the 
monitoring in either identifying the need for a clinical intervention or preventing the need fo r one.  
9.2.9.  COPD Action Plan  
The MTI CarePortal arch itecture  include s the MTI CareBook that provide s the ability to implement  a 
specific patient -centri c COPD Action Plan  with appropriate cultural and literacy considerations.  The 
CareBook enables the Action Plan  through the use of two primary functions, Care Text® and CareTips.  
CareText® generate engagement with patients using its  ability for simple bi- directional messaging using 
questions with pre -formatted responses, requiring only a single key response to answer the question. 
These CareTexts can be sent in seve ral differen t forma ts including Yes/No, emoticons, multiple choice, 
or a slide bar scale. The questions as well as the responses are stored and are viewable on the MTI 
CarePortal. CareTexts can be automatically sent out as part of a CareBook, maintaining e ngageme nt an d 
colle cting simple feedback from patients.  
CareTips are a shorthand approach to e ducate the patients about their disease, how to improve their 
quality of life, and to have them execute small concepts that the caregivers want them to do. These  can 
be some thing a s simple as a health tip to a streaming video on any subject matter.  
An int eractive COPD Action Plan, built around the MTI CareBook will be used to engage patients during 
the study. The  contents of the Action Plan are in the Appendi ces. 
9.2.10.  Usability Q uestion naire  
At the E nd-of-Study phone call,  the patient will be given a brief Usability Questionnaire to collect their 
opinions on use of the GoSpiro  and GoHome , both for usability an d percei ved value to th em and the 
management of their health . The U sabilit y Questionnaire is in the Appendices.  
10. Data Col lection and Confidentiality Procedures  
The data collection tablets placed in patients’ homes are based on the Android operating system. They 
are locked down wi th a Samsung Knox Mobile Device Management ( MDM ) control system  that prevents 
anyone from making changes to the programs or applications . Although the tablets connect with the 
MTI CarePortal via the internet (either W i-Fi or cellular), patie nts have no acc ess to the internet outside 
of the ap plicati ons running on the tablet.  
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 15 of 22 For each patient , a random ized numeric token is sent to the data collection device in their home . All 
data collected from proprietary data collection devices such as the G oHome Personal  Health Monitor or 
the GoClinic Android tablet are then returned to the server with the token. When received, the server 
reidentifies the data based on the token  number  and locates the data in the appropriate patient  file. No 
persona l health  information (PHI) is ever transferred between a rem ote loc ation a nd the MTI CarePortal. 
The access to the data storage system on the MTI CarePortal  is limited to web browsers (SSL Secured), 
direct messaging and electronic data transfer facilitated  with a d ata token.  
The MTI CarePortal cloud server , where the data  is stored, is hosted by Expedient Inc. with the  main  
server located in , Dublin, OH. Operating  mirrored drives, data is  back ed up in Pittsburgh, PA. The  system 
contains a  disaster recovery center in Carmel, IN. E xpedient is a global data management company  that 
complies with HIPAA, HIT RUST  and GDPR requireme nts for data security.  
Settable authorization levels limit users to a) inquiry (read only) capabilities, b) inquiry with also the 
abilit y to set  alarm limits, establish reminders, care plans and the like , and c ) full access for editing and 
updating capabilities depending on the level of authorization. Users have no access to the underlying 
code running the user facing application  or the MTI CarePo rtal infrastruc ture.  
10.1. Acces s to Records  
The records are ava ilable for direct insp ection, v erification, and copyin g, as required by 
applicable la ws and regulations, by  officia ls of  the regulatory hea lth autho rities (FDA and 
others). The investigator shall  comply with applicable privacy a nd security la ws for use and 
disclosure of informa tion related to the research set forth in this pr otocol. 
10.2. Patient  Privacy 
To m aintain patient c onfidentiality, all stu dy reports, and communica tions relating to the  
study will identify patient s by a ssigned subject  number s. The  FDA (or other regula tory 
autho rity) or the Institutional Review Board may a lso request access to a ll stu dy recor ds, 
including  source doc umentation, for insp ection.  
 
As applicable, in a ccordance with HIPAA  and associated pr ivacy reg ulations, a  patient’s  
authoriza tion to u se personally identifiable health in forma tion may be required from each 
patient  before researc h activiti es begin. This a utho rization document shall cl early sp ecify 
which parties will  have acce ss to a patie nt's personal health in forma tion, for what purpose, 
and for how lon g.  
10.3. Record R etention 
The PI will maintain all stu dy recor ds according  to GCP guide lines.  
11. Withdrawal from Study  
Patients should immediately be withdrawn from the study for an y of the follow ing reasons . 
• A condition or adverse e vent that woul d prevent the patient from performing the 
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 16 of 22 spec ified measurements in the protocol  
• At the discretion of the patient  
• At the discretion of the Investigator, if deemed appropriate, for an y reason  
 
If a patient  is withdrawn because of an adverse ev ent, the patient will be followed and treated 
by the Investi gator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or stabilized. The 
adverse events must be followed to resolution and the foll ow-up ev aluations shoul d be 
performed when the patient  has stabiliz ed. 
 Any patient that is withdrawn from the study within the first two  weeks  
due to technical or 
training reasons  will be replaced.  
 If for any reason a patient  does not complete the study, the reason will be entered on the CRF. 
All patient s are fre e to  withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspecified, and without prejudice. The Investigator must record the reason for the early 
termination.  
12. Concomitant Medications  
Patients can remain on all prescribed medications . Med ication s can be changed during the study when 
clinically indicated b y the study PI or patie nt provider. 
13. Statistical Considerations : 
This is a technical evaluation intended to determine if remote patient mo nitoring can be integrated into 
the home monitoring of patients with COPD and determine both the acceptance and value of its use. 
The sample size is not powered or intended to establish statistically significant differences from historic 
experience.  The ad here nce and utilization of the platform, as defined  by the physiologic and QoL 
measurements, will be helpful in establishing guidance for future efficacy trials.   
 Nevertheless, descriptive characteristics of the patients prior to, during, and at the end of t he study will 
be tabulated.  Using the full analytic al set ( FAS), specific  variables  (demographics and clinical variables , 
baseline maintenance and rescue inhaler use , and modified Medical Research Council Score ) will be 
summarized using descriptive me asures (mean and standard deviation, min, max, medi an) and  graphical 
displays (boxplots, histograms) as appropriate.   
 Differences between important continuous variables at two specific times will be evaluated with the 
two-sided paired  t-test (P<0.05).  Important categorical events such as changes in FEV1 , Inspiratory 
Capacity, QoL, medication adherence, rehospitalization and incidence of adverse events will be evaluated by constructing 95% confide nce limits in their incidence, and also  with descriptive statistics. In 
addition, the  results will be used to iden tify technological deficiencies and provide data to inform the 
power requirements for future studies.  
 Prima ry Endpoint Definitio ns 
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 17 of 22 The first primary e ndpoint variable for this stud y is the c hange from  baseline in  Total Sco re of COPD 
Assessment Test (C AT). The total CAT score is calculated by summing the scores of all items and ranges 
from 0 to 40, higher scores indicating severe condition. The change will be calculated  as the CAT sc ore at 
Week 12 minus  the CAT score at Enrollment. A negative change in CAT score will indicate  an 
improvement in patient status.   
 
The seco nd primary e ndpoint variable for this study is adherence to performing scheduled 
measurements and responding to scheduled qu estionnaires. For each su bject the adh erence will be 
reco rded ba sed on the data uploaded to t he CarePortal. The adherence percentage will be calc ulated by 
the difference in recorded measurements and answered question naires versu s the scheduled 
meas urements and question naires.  
 Analysis of Prima ry Endpoints  
The primary outc ome s will be reported as proportions with 95% confidence intervals, on the FAS .  
 
Secondary Endpoint  Definitions  
The p respecified secondary endpoints for this s tudy will in clude:  
• Participant sat isfaction survey scores at 3 months (Time frame: 3 months ) define d as t he 
percentage of p articip ants with score of 4 or higher on individual survey domains. A 
satisfaction survey (investigator-developed, 15 questions, each question is graded on a scale 
of 1-5, 1 being not at all and 5 being extremely ) will be use d to me asure home spirometry 
and table  ease and usefulness.   
 
• Rate  of self-reported COPD exacerbations (Time frame: 3 months)  define d as t he 30 -day 
COPD exacerbation rate, defined as the mean number of events/30 days of follow -up (using 
three month s of fol low-up data). COPD exacerbation events  are defined as self- reporte d 
COPD exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics or steroids . 
 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
The se condary endpoints will be rep orted as p roportion with 95% confidence int erval of partic ipants

analysis of patient satisfaction summary scores will include mean (SD), median (IQR),  range of scores .  
 For the COPD exacerbati on analy ses, th e proportion of patients with C OPD exacerbations  and the rate of 
exacerbations occurring during follow -up will be reported along with 95% CI. A patient will be 
considered censored for exacerbations at the time of the last documented visit, t he end o f the s tudy, or 
death (whichever occur s earlier), if they did not exp erience an exacerbation before.

number of days per week (range 0 -7) participant reports maintenance inhaler use.  
• Change from baseline in rescue inhaler use defined  as the c hange from  baseline to 3 months 
in re scue inhaler use. Rescue in haler use will be categorized at baseline and 3 month visit as 
not at all, once a week or less, 2 -3 times per week, 1 -2 times per day, 3 or more times per 
day.  
 
Analysis of Exploratory Endpo ints  
The exploratory endpoints will b e analyzed as described bel ow. The hypothesis testing  
of these additional secondary efficacy endpoints is considered exploratory . All tests with p value < 0.05 
will be  interpreted nominally as statistically sig nificant .  
 
Version 2.0; 5/24/2020  Page 19 of 22 • For stratified  COPD exacerbation analyses, the proportion of p atients with COPD 
exacerbations  and the rate of exacerbations occurring during follow -up will be reported

14. Safety Mo nitoring  
As this study is deemed low ris k, using technology freq uently prescribed for use by COPD patients at 
home, oversight for this fea sibility st udy will be conducted by the PI (Dr. Dru mmond).  The PI will 
monitor data to en sure the safety of participants.  Only treatment-r elated serious adve rse even ts (SAEs) 
will b e reported to the IRB using the Adverse Event Template Form, per instituti onal and na tional 
guidelines within one business da y of no tification of the event.  Hospi talization for COPD exacerbation 
will be considere d an SAE. SAEs will be trac ked for 30 days following termination of the study.  
15. Admini strative Requirements

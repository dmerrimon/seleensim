Name of Sponsor/Company: Oncologie , Inc.  
Name of Finished Product: Bavituximab  
Name of Active Ingredient : Chimeric Anti -Phosphatidylserine Monoclonal Antibody  
Name of Combination Product: Pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1) 
Inhibitor  
Title of Study: A Phase 2, multicenter open -label, non -randomized study of bavituximab 
plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal cancer who have 
progressed on or after at least one prior standard therapy  
Number of  Study Sites: Approximately 28 
Study centers: This global, multicenter trial will be conducted in the United States (US), 
United Kingdo m (UK), South Korea, and Taiwan  and other countries as deemed appropriate.   
Studied period (years):   
Date first patient enrolled: Approximately June   2019 
Date last patient completed:  Approximately June  2021  Phase of development:  2 
 
Rationale:  
Oncologie, Inc. is developing bavituximab , a chimeric monoclonal antibody  (mAb) that 
inhibits  the immunosuppressive effects of phosphatidylserine  (PS), for the treatment of 
cancer . PS modulates the tumor microenvironment as a ligand for multiple receptors on 
suppressor cells leading to secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming 
growth factor -beta (TGF -) and interleukin -10 (IL -10) from M2 -macrophages and  myeloid -
derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ). PS exposure in the tumor microenvironment  prevents 
dendritic cell maturation and inhibits development of tumor -specific cytotoxic T cell s. Of 
import ance, expression of PS on the external surface of t umors  cell acts as an 
immunosuppressive ligand for multiple immune receptors , including TIM/TAM.  Nonclinical 
data show that bavituximab blocks PS immunosuppressive sig naling, provides specifici ty for 
innate immune responses, and activates T -cell-driven adaptive immunopathways that 
reactivate a therapeutically effective immune response to the tumor.   
Pembrolizuma b is a mAb  that acts by blocking  the interaction b etween PD -1 and its ligands, 
programmed death -ligand 1 ( PD-L1) and programmed death -ligand 2 (PD-L2). Molecules 
that disrupt the interaction of PD1/PD -L1, also known as immune check  point inhibitors 
(CPI), are emerging as a front -line treatment for several  types of cancer.  Pembrolizumab is 
approved in the US for the treatment of patients with  recurrent locally advanced or metastatic 
gastric or gastroeso phageal junction  (GEJ)  adenocarcinoma after disease progression on or 
after two or more p rior lines of the rapy including fluoropyrimidine - and platinum -containing 
chemotherapy . 
Although efficacy is notable and can be sustained, many patients fail pembrolizumab 
treatment potentially due to exhaustion of specific T -cells. Exhausted T -cells express elevated 
level s of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM3), as opposed to activated or 
partially activated T -cells. Bavituximab binding to PS interrupts its binding to TIM3, which 
 
Amendment  4 Page 5 of 102 Confidential  
  may partially reverse the exhaustion and restore activity to pembrolizumab. Theref ore, the 
combination of bavituximab with pembrolizumab may enhance the antitumor immune 
response resulting in increased clinical benefit.   
Given the potential for this combination to enhance antitumor responses, it is being evaluated 
in 2 populations  of advanced gastric or GEJ cancer patients : patients  that have progressed on 
standard chemotherapy  and are naïve to CPI therapy  (Group 1) ; patient s that had a confirmed 
partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to CPI inhibitor alone or in combination 
with chemotherapy , then subsequ ently progressed following treatment with  CPI either alone 
or in combination with chemotherapy ( Group 2 ).  
Study Objectives:  
Study obje ctives are the same for both Group 1 ( CPI naïve ) and Group 2 ( CPI relapse).    
Primary:  
To assess the safety and tolerability of bavituximab in combination with pembrolizumab in 
patients with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer  
To assess the antitumor activity of  the treatment combination based on Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guideline  version 1.1 ( Appendix A ) 
Secondary:  
To further characterize the antitumor activity of the treatment combination based on 
additional assessments of clinical benefit  
To evaluate bavituximab concentrations when administered in combination with 
pembrolizumab  
To assess the potential immunogenicity of bavituximab   
Tertiary:  
To evaluate a novel biomarker signature panel and correlate with efficacy outcomes in 
patients treated with bavituximab -pembrolizumab combination  
Study Endpoints:  
Study endpoints are the same for both Group 1 (CPI naïve) and Group 2 (CPI relapse).    
Primary:  
• Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)  
graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 , including changes in clinical laboratory 
parameters  
• Objective response rate (ORR) as assesse d by the Investigator per RECIST version  
1.1 
Secondary:  
• Duration of response ( DoR), disease control rate (DCR) (as defined by ORR and 
stable disease rate at 6 weeks ), progression -free survival (PFS), and o verall survival 
(OS)  
• Bavituximab concentrations before and after bavituximab infusions   
• Presence of a nti-bavituximab  antibo dies (anti-drug antibodies [ADAs ])  
 
Amendment  4 Page 6 of 102 Confidential  
  Tertiary:  
• Analysis of tissue to determine percentage of patients with defined genetic signature  
• Preliminary correlation of ORR to genetic signature  
• Status of genomic and immune biomarkers in blood and tissue samples at baseline and 
change from baseline upon treatment  
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label, non-randomized study with an initial safety 
analysis to assess the safety and tolerability of bavituximab administered in combination with 
pembrolizumab, a PD -1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  
who have either progressed o n standard chemotherapy and are naïve to CPI therapy  
(Group  1), or have progressed following treatment with CPI either alone or in combination 
with chemotherapy  (Group 2) .  Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled  in the study; a  
minimum of 40 patients w ill be enrolled in Group 1 and a minimum of 20 patients will be 
enrolled in Group 2 .  
Following a minimum of 3 and a maximum of a 10-patient safety  run-in with bavituximab 
(3 mg/kg intravenous [IV] weekly) and pembrolizumab (200  mg IV every 3 weeks [Q3W]),  
additional patients will be recruited if the initial doses of the regimen are tolerable. Lower 
doses of bavituximab may be explored if the initial doses are not tolerable. Primary anti -
tumor activity will be documented by Investigator -assessed ORR per REC IST v. 1.1. A total 
of 80 patients will be enrolled.  
The first 3 patients will be evaluated for dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) for the purpose of 
declaring the tentative recommended dose for expansion (RDE). The Safety Review 
Committee (SRC) will review d ata from these patients for DLTs at the end of the first 3 -week 
cycle:  
• If 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT on any dose level, the RDE will be tentatively 
declared and further dose expansion will continue.  
• If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT on any dose level, that cohort will be expanded to 
6 patients. If 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT, the RDE will be tentatively declared 
and further dose expansion will continue.  
• If ≥ 2 of 3 or ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT on Dose Level 0, Dose Level -1 will 
be explored. If ≥ 2 of 3 or ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT on Dose Level -1, Dose 
Level -2 will be explored.  
• If  2 DLT(s ) occur  in up to 6 patients at Dose Level -2, further enrollment and dosing 
will be stopped until there is a full review of all available data, including PK, by the 
SRC.  
After a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 eligible patients are enrolled and treated for at 
least 1 cycle (3 weeks), the SRC will review data from these patients to determine the RDE. 
In case of DLTs during Cycl e 1, de -escalating doses of bavituximab in combination with 
pembrolizumab will be ( Table A ) as follows:  
Table A: Planned Dose Levels  
Dose Level  IV Bavituximab (Weekly)  IV Pembrolizumab (Q3W)  
 
Amendment  4 Page 7 of 102 Confidential  
  0 3 mg/kg  200 mg  
-1 2 mg/kg  200 mg  
-2 1 mg/kg  200 mg  
After the DLT observation period, expansion may proceed. The cumulative safety data from 
the initial 3 to10 patients will be evaluated by the SRC, as well as subsequent safety data 
from the expansion population, as deemed appropriate by the SRC.  
Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
A DLT is defined as any of the AE described below that occurs during the DLT observation 
period and is at least possibly related to bavituximab or pembrolizumab.  The Investigator will 
use CTCAE v5.0  guidelines to assign an AE term and severity grade relevant to the DLT.  
A DLT is defined as any of the AEs described below that occurs during the DLT observation 
period and is at least possibly related to bavituximab or pembrolizumab. The Investigator will  
use CTCAE v5.0 guidelines to assign an AE term and severity grade relevant to the DLT.  
Hematological toxicities as follows:  
o Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days, except thrombocytopenia:  
▪ Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration  
▪ Grade 3 thrombocyto penia associated with clinically significant 
bleeding  
o  Grade 3 febrile neutropenia  
▪ Grade 3 is defined as ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of 
>38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥38 
degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more than 1 hour  
▪ Grade 4 is defined as ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of 
>38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained  temperature of ≥38 
degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more than 1 hour, with life -threatening 
consequences and urgent intervention indicated.  
o Grade 4 lymphocyte decreases lasting > 14 days  
 
Non-hematologic toxicities:  
o Any nonhematologic AE ≥Grade 3 in severi ty should be considered a DLT, with the 
following exceptions: Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤3 days; Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea, or 
vomiting without use of anti -emetics or anti -diarrheals per standard of care; Grade 3 
rash without use of corticosteroids or anti -inflammatory agents per standard of care.  
o Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematologic laboratory value if:  
 
Amendment  4 Page 8 of 102 Confidential  
  ▪ Clinically significant medical intervention is required to treat the 
subject, or  
▪ The abnormality leads to hospitalization, or  the abnormality persists 
for > 1 week ; the abnormality results in a Drug -induced Liver Injury 
(DILI)  
▪ Exceptions: Clinically nonsignificant, treatable, or reversible 
laboratory abnormalities including liver function tests, uric acid, etc.  
o Prolonged delay (>2  weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment -related toxicity.  
o Any treatment -related toxicity that causes the participant to discontinue treatment 
during Cycle 1.  
o Missing >25% of planned d oses as a result of drug -related AE(s) during the first cycle.  
o Grade 5 toxici ty. 
 
Isolated laboratory changes without associated clinical signs or symptoms may not be 
included in this definition. These findings will be discussed and reviewed by the Investigators 
and the Sponsor’s medical monitor.  
Safety data in subsequent cycles will also be monitored on an ongoing basis to determine the 
cumulative incidence of late -onset toxicities.  
Adverse events that are not classified as DLTs by the above definition can be designated as 
DLTs if agreed upon by the Investigators and the S ponsor’s medical monitor.  
Safety data in subsequent cycles will also be monitored on an ongoing basis to determine the 
cumulative incidence of late -onset toxicities . 
Patients who experience a DLT, but in the opinion of the Investigator can be adequately 
monitored for recurrence of the toxicity and are otherwise experiencing clinical benefit, may 
be offered continued treatment with bavituximab and pembrolizumab.  
Dosing will continue until criteria for study treatment discontinuation are met (unacceptable 
toxicity, progressive disease [PD], or withdrawal from the study) or up to a maximum of 
35 cycles.  
Patients will be assessed for tumor response/progression per RECIST version1.1 ( Appendix 
A). The initial tumor assessment on study therapy will be conducted 6 w eeks after initiation 
of treatment then every 6 weeks until disease progression or another withdrawal criterion is 
met. 
Progressive disease must be confirmed by a second scan 4 weeks after initial PD diagnosis in 
the absence of clearly symptomatic and/or r apidly progressive clinical deterioration or 
requirement for urgent intervention. It is anticipated that most patients will remain on 
treatment during the 4 weeks between scans.  
Number of Patients Planned: Up to 80 patients are planned.  
 
Amendment  4 Page 9 of 102 Confidential  
  Study Duration:  
Enrollment is planned to occur over approximately 13 months. Treatment and follow -up 
projected will be completed within approximately 6 months thereafter. Anticipated duration 
of the study is at least 21 mon ths.

  Pharmacokinetics of bavituximab:  Peripheral venous blood (4 mL) will be collected from 
all patients during Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 15 within 24 hours prior to bavituximab infusion, 
and at 1 hour (± 30 minutes) after the end of bavituximab infusion. Samples a re also collected 
within 24 hours prior to bavituximab infusion on Cycle 2 Days 1 and 15, and Day 1 of Cycles 
3, 4, and 6 for quantitation of bavituximab.  
Biomarkers:  
Peripheral blood and tumor tissue will be collected for biomarker analysis. Tissue will be 
obtained prior to therapy (mandatory fresh tumor biopsy and, if available, archival sample) 
and this tissue will be used to measure potential tissue -based predictive biomarkers. Those 
biomarkers include immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well as RNA signatures. Residual 
sample material available after completion of the designated analyses may be used in the 
future for identification of predictive markers or to enhance understanding of disease biology 
unless prohibited by local laws or regulations.  Samples will be de -identified to ensure patient 
privacy. Serum will be collected at baseline and at timepoints post treatment as specified in 
the protocol to assess circulating pharmacodynamic biomarkers.  
Statistical Methods:  
The trial will evaluate safe ty and efficacy of the bavituximab -pembrolizumab combination in 
a disease setting in which pembrolizumab has shown promising but modest activity. The 
hypothesis to be evaluated is whether the bavituximab -pembrolizumab combination will yield 
an ORR superior  to historical ORR of pembrolizumab in the 2nd-line setting in patients who 
have not previously been exposed to an anti -PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 agent.  
Sample Size:  
The primary efficacy objective of this Phase 2 study is the evaluation of ORR of bavituximab 
in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ cancer. The  
overall sample size of 80 patients was chosen to yield adequate information regarding 
efficacy at the recommended dose and to allow an initial correlation of  the preliminary 
efficacy with biomarker profiles.  This include s patients enrolled in both Group 1 and 
Group  2. Both 2nd and 3rd line patients will be enrolled with no cap on either line of treatment  
of patients. The 2nd line cohort will have 72% to 86% po wer to show that the lower bound of 
the 80% CI is greater than 15% for 30 -50 patients is the with a true ORR of 30%, and the 3rd 
line cohort will have 67% to 78% power to show that the lower bound of the 80% CI is 
greater than 6% for 30 -50 patients is the with a true ORR of 15%.   
For Group 1 (CPI naïve),a pproximately 40 patients are needed to show a statistical 
superiority  of bavituximab -pembrolizumab with 80% statistical power at one -sided type I 
error rate of α=0.10. For the CPI -relpase patient populatio n, the n was set to 20 patients for 
the initial assessment of safety, tolerability and initial antitumor activity.  See the statistical 
section of the protocol for further detail . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety  
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment will be included in the safety 
analyses (safety analysis set). DLT evaluable set will be included for the first 3 patients up to 
 
Amendment  4 Page 15 of 102 Confidential  
  a maximum of 10 patients who have received at least 1 dose and comp leted 1 full cycle 
follow up  or experienced a DLT . 
The safety and tolerability of study treatment will be evaluated based on AEs (incidence and 
severity), performance status, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, standard 
clinical laboratory safety evaluations. Laboratory abnormalities and AEs will be graded 
according to CTCAE v5.0. Immune -related reactions (IRRs) may occur with bavituximab 
and/or pembrolizumab. Detailed guidance for the handling of IRRs will be presented in the 
protocol.  
Pharmacokinetics  
Serum concentrations for bavituximab will be listed and summarized using descriptive 
statistics by cohort at each time point.   
Immunogenicity  
The immunogenicity of bavituximab (ADA formation) will be investigated during the course 
of the study.  
Efficacy  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the full analysis set, and per protocol analysis set, 
including predefined biomarker subgroups (as below). Radiological and clinical tumor 
assessments will be evaluated based on RECIST version1. 1. For patients with PD, a 
confirmatory scan will be performed at least 4  weeks later to confirm PD prior to removing 
the patient from study treatment. This confirmatory scan is recommended but not required , it 
is at the discretion of the treating physicia n. 
Statistical Methods:  
Tabular summaries of data will be descriptive in nature (i.e., number of patients [n], mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables and n and 
percent for categorical variables). A more detailed description of analysis methods will be 
provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) to be completed prior to the clinical database 
lock.

  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Overview of Bavituximab  
Oncologie, Inc. is developing bavituximab as an immunomodulatory drug for the treatment of 
cancer . Bavituximab is a chimeric (human/mouse) monoclonal antibody (mAb) derived from 
murine mAb 3G4 that targets phosphatidylserine (PS) after binding to β2 -glycop rotein 1 (β2 -
GP1).  
In normal non -tumorigenic cells, PS is segregated to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. 
Conditions that induce cellular stress, including normal cell death, immune phagocytic cell 
clearance, oxygen radicals, hypoxia, irradiation, and chemotherapy, cause a shift resulting in the 
externalization of PS to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Exposed PS is recognized and 
bound by PS receptors on immune cells where it induces and maintains immune suppression. 
This relocation also o ccurs in tumor cells, exosomes, and vascular endothelial cells inducing 
non-inflammatory signals via multiple receptors which contribute to the immunosuppression of 
the tumor microenvironment , including binding to  TIM/TAM receptors . Phosphatidylserine -
targeting agents block PS -mediated immunosuppression by multifocal reprograming of the 
immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to support immune reactivation. Antibody -
mediated PS blockade reduces the levels of myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSC s), 
transforming growth factor -beta (TGF -β), and interleukin (IL) -10, and increases the levels of 
tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α) and IL -12. Phosphatidylserine blockade also repolarizes 
tumor -associated macrophages (TAMs) from predominant M2 to predominant M1 phenotype, 
promotes the mat uration of dendritic cells , and induces potent adaptive antitumor T -cell 
immunity. In vitro  studies have shown that bavituximab binds to PS in the presence of β2 -GP1 as 
a high affinity complex, modulating β2 -GP1 binding to PS from 1 μM to 1 nM. In experimental 
mouse cancer models, the bavituximab surrogate antibody mch1N11 as a single agent reduc ed 
tumor growth and prolonged survival. In addition , the anti -tumor effects of mch1N11 were 
enhanced by co -administration of checkpoint inhibitors (anti - Cytotoxic T -Lymphocyte Associated 
Protein 4  (CTLA4 ) and anti -PD-1/L1), as well as chemotherapy or radi ation (Yin et al., 2013a ; 
Yin et al., 2013b ). 
Bavituximab is an attractive immunotherapeutic approach to treating cancer, because its primary 
mechanism of action involves modulating the tumor microenv ironment from a primarily 
immunosuppressive, angiogenesis -promoting state (with infiltrating MDSCs  and M2 -
macrophages) to an immune activating state (with long -term tumor -specific immunity facilitated 
by M1 macrophages, mature dendritic cells, and activate d T lymphocytes). In essence, 
expression of PS on the external surface of the cell acts as an immunosuppressive signal in 
normal cell death and immune phagocytic clearance , thus allowing tumor growth and 
progression . Exposing PS on the exter nal surface of the cell provides a rich source of ligand for 
multiple immune rece ptors expressed on immune cells present in the microenvironment, 
including PS binding to T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3  (TIM3 ) receptors .  
Nonclinical  data suggest that bavituximab and pembrolizumab can be co -administered 
effectively as demonstrated in murine models for melanoma and triple negative breast cancer. 
Combining PS -targeting antibody mch1N11 with a single dose of radiotherapy and anti -
program med cell death protein 1 (PD -1) blocking antibody , a triple therapy combination, to treat 
 
Amendment  4 Page 27 of 102 Confidential  
  mice bearing PD -1 resistant melanoma, results in almost complete tumor elimination and leads to 
statistically significant prolonged survival  (Giese et al., 2018 ). 
Gray et al. (2016 ) demonstrated that immune -competent  mice i mplanted  with triple negative 
breast cancer ( TNBC ) cell lines and treated with a combination of the PS -targeting anti body 
mch1N11 and anti-PD-1 antibody therapy ha d significantly greater inhibitory tumor growth 
activity and significantly increased overall survival compared with either sing le treatment alone, 
and is cap able of causing complete tumor regression. Addition ally, mice treated  with the 
combination experi enced complete tumor regression , demonstrated increased splenic IFN γ 
production  and enhanced number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ). Furthermore, on 
TNBC re -challenge those treated with the combinations were capable of mounting a durable 
immune respons e tha t suppressed tumor growth.  
Bavituximab has been administered to 800 patients in early and late phase studies. Initial 
indication of activity for bavituximab as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy is 
noted i n phase 2 trials for breast cancer, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic 
cancer. A Phase 3 advanced NSCLC trial, SUNRISE, was completed.  The primary endpoint of 
improved overall survival (OS) in bavituximab plus docetaxel versus docetaxel plu s placebo was 
not met. However, subgroup analysis indicated that patients who progressed on study treatment 
with bavituximab plus docetaxel and went onto a checkpoint inhibitor showed significantly 
improved OS compared to a similar group of patients with p rogressive disease (PD) post 
docetaxel plus placebo who went onto receive a checkpoint inhibitor.  
1.1.1.  Nonclinical Experience with Bavituximab  
In nonclinical studies, no target organs of toxicity were identified in rats and monkeys receiving 
doses of bavituxim ab of up to 100 mg/kg. Incidental minimal histological findings were noted in 
heart and lungs in high -dose monkeys and included left ventricular thrombus, right ventricular 
subendocardial fibrosis and arteriopathy, and fibrosis in the lung. In rats, subend ocardial 
inflammation was noted in the high -dose group. Bavituximab has been associated with 
immunogenicity in rats and monkeys. A dose -related prolongation of aPTT in rats and of aPTT 
and PT in monkeys has been demonstrated to be an in vitro phenomenon du e to inhibition of 
phospholipid -dependent coagulation assays. Bavituximab up to 100 mg/kg did not affect time -to-
healing in dermal healing rodent models.  
Refer to the bavituximab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed nonclinical data.  
1.1.2.  Clinical Experien ce with Bavituximab  
Phase 1 (single agent, safety, and pharmacokinetic [PK]) and Phase 1b (safety, tolerability, and 
PK) studies of bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy have been completed in patients 
with advanced cancer. Several Phase 2 studies o f bavituximab with chemotherapy have been 
completed, including safety and efficacy studies in patients with locally or advanced metastatic 
cancers. These studies include patients with NSCLC, previously treated or untreated non -
squamous NSCLC, breast cancer , and previously untreated Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. A Phase 3 
clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bavituximab when given with docetaxel in 
patients with previously treated Stage 3b/4 non -squamous NSCLC was discontinued following a 
pre-specified interim analysis. Addition of bavituximab to docetaxel did not improve OS in 
previously treated advanced NSCLC. Subset analyses suggested possible benefit in high β2GP1 
 
Amendment  4 Page 28 of 102 Confidential  
  cases and those subsequently receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Current d evelopment of 
bavituximab is focused on the combination of bavituximab with other therapeutic approaches 
including radiation and immunotherapies.  
Across all studies, the profile of serious adverse events (SAEs) in subjects receiving bavituximab 
in combina tion with chemotherapy or an antiviral was similar to those receiving chemotherapy 
alone. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia (4.6%), neutropenia (4.0%), pneumonia 
(2.7%), and pulmonary embolism (2.0%), anemia (1.6%), pyrexia (1.6%), dyspnea (1.1 %), deep 
vein thrombosis (1.3%), asthenia (1.2%), diarrhea (1.0%), fatigue (1.0%), and sepsis (1.0%). The 
only events that occurred at a meaningfully higher frequency (increase by >1.0%) in subjects 
receiving bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy co mpared to those receiving 
chemotherapy alone were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and anemia. These events were not 
observed in the small group of patients receiving bavituximab monotherapy.  
Infusion reactions and similar events (e.g. hypersensitivity re actions and anaphylaxis) have 
occurred in association with bavituximab administration and are a known class effect of chimeric 
mAbs. These types of reactions have occurred more commonly in oncology studies in which 
chemotherapy is also administered, but ha ve also occurred in monotherapy studies in both the 
antiviral and oncology programs. The highest incidence was in Study PPHM 0704, a study 
conducted in the Republic of Georgia in which patients with advanced breast cancer also 
received docetaxel therapy. A ll reactions in that study were mild or moderate in severity, and 
patients were able to continue to receive bavituximab without an apparent increase (or decrease) 
in the frequency or severity of the reactions. It is unclear what impact, if any, that the 
concomitant chemotherapy, patient characteristics, or environment had on the frequency of 
events in this study.  
Grade 3 infusion reactions have occurred in other studies, resulting in discontinuation of patients 
from treatment with bavituximab. Infusion rea ctions have occurred both with and without 
premedication, and it is unclear whether the type of co -administered chemotherapy or 
premedication with steroids and antihistamines impacts the frequency or severity of infusion 
reactions. Reports of infusion reac tions will continue to be monitored.  
Refer to the bavituximab IB for detailed clinical data.  
1.1.3.   Rationale for Study and Starting Dose of Bavituximab  
The approved dose and schedule of pembrolizumab will be used in this trial in combination with 
the recommend ed dose of bavituximab for Phase 2 and Phase 3 development. No overlapping 
toxicities are expected, and the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review emerging data 
during the conduct of the trial.    
1.2. Overview of Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab  is a potent human ized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)  monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting its 
interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death ligand  2 (PD-
L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor 
blocking activity for PD -1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in 
clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. 
Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of 
 
Amendment  4 Page 29 of 102 Confidential  
  indications. For more details on specific indications  and background information,  refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure /approved labeling for pemb rolizumab . 
1.2.1.  Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades [Disis, 2010]. Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tu mor-infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+  effector 
T-cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long -term 
survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular 
carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can 
be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objecti ve tumor responses in cancers such as 
melanoma [Dudley et al., 2005; Hunder et al., 2008].  
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune 
control. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily 
member related to cluster of differentiation 28 ( CD28) and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated 
protein 4 ( CTLA -4) that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement  of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) [Greenwald et al., 2005; Okazaki et al., 2001].  
The structure of murine  PD-1 has been resolved [Zhang et al., 2004]. PD -1 and its family members 
are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable –type (IgV -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signaling  
molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch 
motif. Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases , SHP -1 and SHP -2, 
to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta (PKCθ), 
and zeta -chain -associated protein kinase (ZAP70 ), which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling 
cascade [Okazaki et al., 2001; Chemnitz et al., 2004; Sheppard et al., 2004; and Riley, 2009]. 
The mechanism by which PD -1 down -modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but distinct from, 
that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [Parry 
et al., 2005; Francisco, 2010]. As a consequence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention in gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) aden ocarcinoma .  
1.2.2.  Non-clinical  and Clinical Trials  
 
Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking PD -
1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads to 
tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with ot her treatment modalities 
[Hirano, 2005; Blank, 2004;Weber, 2010;  Strome, 2003; Spranger, 2014; Curran, 2010; Pilon, 
2010] .  Anti -mouse PD -1 or anti -mouse PD -L1 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor responses 
in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia 
and colorectal carcinoma [Strome, 2003; Curran, 2010; Pilon, 2010; Nomi, 2007; Zhang, 2004 ].  
In such studies, tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells and increased IFN -γ, granzyme B and perforin 
 
Amendment  4 Page 30 of 102 Confidential  
  expression were observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of PD -
1 checkpoint inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo  
[Curran, 2010] . Experiments have confirmed the in vivo  efficacy of anti -mouse  PD-1 antibody as 
a monotherapy, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models 
(see the Investigator’s Brochure [IB]).  
1.2.3.  Justification for Dose  
The planned dose of pembrolizumab  for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the 
totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200  mg Q3W is the appropriate 
dose of pembrolizumab  for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type. As outlined 
below, this dose is justified by:  
• Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose - and exposure -efficacy 
relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W),  
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including ove rall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and  
• Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from pharmacokinetic [PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK 
[PBPK] analysis) at 200 m g Q3W . 
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled 
with melanoma and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), covering different disease settings 
(treatment naïve, previously treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all-comers ) and different treatment 
settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2  mg/kg 
Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and 
KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10  mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, 
KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose - and exposure -
response relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5 -fold 
difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fix ed-dose) Q3W provided similar responses to 
the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat dose -exposure -response relationships were also 
observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and 
classical Hodgkin Lymph oma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of 
the tumor type. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab , 
which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells.  
Addition ally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK data in 
KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated 
saturation of PD -1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Secon d, a 
PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of tumor 
penetration and PD -1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab  at 200 mg 
Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor.  
Finally, populat ion PK analysis of pembrolizumab , which characterized the influence of body 
weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability as weight -based  dosing, with considerable overlap in  the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by 
these PK characteristics, and given that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity 
 
Amendment  4 Page 31 of 102 Confidential  
  and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was sel ected for evalua tion 
across all pembrolizumab  protocols.  
 
1.3. Rationale for Combining Bavituximab with Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab was recently approved in the US and other countries for later line treatment of 
recurrent or advanced gastric or GEJ ad enocarcinoma based on the KEYNOTE 059 in which 
patients received 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) every 3  weeks until disease 
progression, Investigator or patient decision to withdraw, or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 259 
patients were enrolled;  most were male (198 [76.4%]) and white (200 [77.2%]). The median 
(range) age was 62 (24 -89) years. Objective response rate (ORR) was 11.6% (95%CI, 8.0% -
16.1%; 30 of 259 patients), with complete response (CR) in 2.3% (95%CI, 0.9% -5.0%; 6 of 259 
patients). Median (range) response duration was 8.4 (1.6+ to 17.3+) months. ORR and median 
(range) response duration were 15.5% (95%CI, 10.1% -22.4%; 23 of 148 patients) and 16.3 (1.6+ 
to 17.3+) months, and 6.4% (95%CI, 2.6% -12.8%; 7 of 109  patients) and 6.9 (2.4 to 7 .0+) 
months in patients with PD -L1–positive and PD -L1–negative tumors, respectively. Forty -six 
patients (17.8%) experienced 1 or more Grade 3 to 5 treatment -related adverse events (AEs). 
Based on these results, albeit positive for gastric cancer patients b ut still suboptimal in this 
aggressive disease, and pembrolizumab’s manageable safety profile, pembrolizumab will be a 
rationale combination for the treatment of gastric cancer.  In addition, KEYNOTE 061 
pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel , pembrolizumab did n ot significantly improve overall survival 
compared with paclitaxel as second -line therapy for advanced gastric or gastro -esophageal 
junction cancer with PD -L1 CPS of 1 or higher, although a better safety profile than paclitaxel 
was identified.   Median ove rall survival was 9·1 months (95% CI 6·2 –10·7) with 
pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (7·6 –9·0) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio  [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·66 –
1·03; one -sided p=0·0421). Median progression -free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI 1·4 –2·0) 
with pembrolizumab a nd 4·1 months (3·1 –4·2) with paclitaxel (HR 1·27, 95% CI 1·03 –
1·57).  The ORR in these patients was 13.3% (95% CI, 8.2 -20.0), including a complete response 
(CR) rate of 1.4% and a partial response (PR) rate of 11.9%.  
Pembrolizumab  has received accelerated a pproval for the treatment of 3rd-line (plus) gastric/GEJ 
cancer. However, the ORR was 11.6% (95% CI, 8.0%, 16.1%) , implying that the majority of 
such patients fail to derive sufficient benefit from pembrolizumab monotherapy. In experimental 
mouse cancer mo dels, the bavituximab surrogate antibody used in combination with an anti -
PD-1/L1 antibody demonstrated enhanced tumor control. Bavituximab has also demonstrated a 
tolerable safety profile. Thus, little to no overlapping toxicities are anticipated.  The SUN RISE  
subgroup analysis indicated that patients who progressed on study treatment with bavituximab 
plus docetaxel and went onto a checkpoint inhibitor showed significantly improved OS. These 
data in combination with the preclinical data suggest that bavitux imab may restimulate T cells or 
render exhausted T  cells susceptible to checkpoint inhibition. Therefore, we hypothesize the 
addition of bavituximab to  pembrolizumab may enhance the antitumor immune response and 
eventually potentiate the activity of the antibody that is already targeting checkpoint inhibition, 
resulting in increased clinical benefit . 
Given the potential for this combination to enhance an titumor responses, it is being evaluated in 
2 populations  of advanced gastric or GEJ cancer patients: CPI naïve patients that have 
 
Amendment  4 Page 32 of 102 Confidential  
  progressed on standard chemotherapy and are naïve to CPI therapy; and CPI relapse patients that 
had a confirmed PR or CR  then subsequently progressed following treatment with CPI either 
alone or in combination with chemotherapy.  
1.4. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Clinical trials in cancer are designed to assess new therapeutic strategies that may provide greater 
benefit, less toxicity or b oth than those of existing therapies. This trial is an initial attempt to 
understand the activity and safety profile of an approved agent for gastric/GEJ cancer when used 
in combination with an experimental agent that has shown promise in preclinical testi ng. 
However, subjects enrolled in clinical trials cannot expect to receive direct benefit from this 
proposed combination.  
Common AEs observed with anti P D-1/PD-L1 agents include diarrh ea/colitis, 
pneumonitis/ interstitial lung disease ( ILD), hepatitis and increases in transaminases, 
endocrinopathies (hypo - and hyper -thyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, 
hypophysitis/hypopituitarism and Type 1 diabetes mellitus), myocarditis, nephritis and increases 
in serum creatinine, dermatitis/rash and pruritus, neuromuscul ar toxicity such as myasthenia 
gravis and Guillain -Barré , and pancreatitis.  
Emerging safety data from bavituximab trials, indicates that the overall safety profile appears to 
be acceptable and consistent across studies. Combination therapy, particularly w ith docetaxel, 
did not substantially increase the AE risks. Sporadic infusion reactions have occurred, and it is 
not clear if corticosteroid premedication mitigates this risk. Refer to the bavituximab IB for 
additional details.  
No patients have been treate d with bavituximab and immune checkpoint inhibitors to date in 
Oncologie -sponsored trials.  Overall,  the potential additional benefits of the combination of 
bavituximab and pembrolizumab therapy are l ikely to outweigh the risk s.

  3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label, non -randomized study with an initial safety analysis to 
assess the safety and tolerability of bavituximab administered in combination with 
pembrolizumab, a PD -1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ  adenocarcinoma who 
have either progressed on standard chemotherapy and are naïve to CPI therapy  (Group  1), or had 
a confirmed PR or CR then subsequently  progressed following treatment with CPI either alone or 
in combination with chemotherapy  (Group 2).   
Following a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10  patient safety run -in with bavituximab 
(3 mg/kg IV weekly) and pembrolizumab (200  mg IV every 3  weeks [Q3W]), additional patients 
will be recruited if the initial doses of the regimen are tolerable. Lower doses of bavituximab 
may be explored if the initial doses are not tolerable. Primary anti -tumor activity will be 
documented by Investigator -assessed objective response per RECIST 1.1. A pproximately   80 
patients will be enrolled  in the study, a minimum of 40 pati ents will be enrolled in Group 1 and a 
minimum of 20 patients will be enrolled in Group 2.  
The first 3 patients will be evaluated for dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) for the purpose of 
declaring the tentative RDE. The SRC will review data from these patie nts for DLTs at the end 
of the first 3 -week cycle.  
After a minimum of 3 and maximum of 10 eligible patients are enrolled and treated for at least 
1 cycle (3 weeks), the SRC will review data from these patients to determine the recommended 
dose for expansi on (RDE ). In case of DLTs, de -escalating doses of bavituximab in combination 
with pembrolizumab will be assessed  (see Section  5.6). After the DLT observation  period , 
expansion may proceed. The cumulative safety data from the initial 3 to 10 patients will be 
evaluated by the SRC, as well as subsequent safety data from the expansion population, as 
deemed appropriate by the SRC.   
Once the RDE of the com bination of bavituximab  and pembrolizumab  has been confirmed,  
additional patients , for a total of 80  across both groups , will be enrolled in the expansion and  
assessed for preliminary efficacy and pharmacodynamic  effects, as well as  safety and 
tolerability. Patients will be evaluated regularly for safety and efficacy according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table  8). 
Safety data  will be monitored throughout the course of the study including but not limited to; 
reviewing trends in safety data, laboratory analytes, and AEs including monitoring of adverse 
events of special interest (AESIs).  
The SRC, comprised of a medical monitor, statistician, the primary Investigator, and ad hoc SRC 
members, as needed, will be responsible for review of safety data. The SRC will convene 
regularly to review data to assess DLTs, and will convene at least yearly to review all safety 
data.  
Additional formal meetings for the SRC will occur  
(a) when a total of 10 patients have received at least one dose of study therapy and followed 
for 3 months after the 10th subject  patient receives the first dose of study therapy  and  
 
Amendment  4 Page 35 of 102 Confidential  
  (b) when a total of 40 patients have received at least one dose of study therapy and followed 
for 3 months after the 40th patient receives the first dose of study therapy    
Special attention will be paid for later -onset DLT -like toxicities.  
Patients will be assessed for tumor r esponse/progression per RECIST version1.1 ( Appendix A ). 
The initial tumor assessment on study therapy will be conducted 6 weeks after initiation of 
treatment for, then every 6 weeks until disease progression or another withdrawal criterion is 
met. 
An End -of-Treatment Visit will be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation followed 
by a Safety Follow -Up Visit 30 days after the end of treatment.  
3.2. Study Duration  
Enrollment is planned to occur over approximately 13 months. Treatment and follow -up 
projec ted will be completed within approximately 6 months thereafter. The total anticipated 
duration of the study is at least 21 months .

4.4. Patients or Partners of Patients of Reproductive Potential  
Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion and women of childbearing potential must not be considering 
getting pregnant during the study.  
It is unknown whether bavituximab or pembrolizumab  is excreted in human milk. Since many 
drugs are exc reted in human milk, and because of the  potential for serious adverse reactions in the 
nursing infant, participants who are breastfeeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
 
 Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregn ancy test 
within 72 hours prior to start of study treatment. A serum or urine pregnancy test will be 
performed at the End -of-Treatment (EOT) Visit.  
To be considered of non -childbearing potential, a female patient must meet at least one of the 
following criteria:  
• Postmenopausal (i.e., amenorrheic for ≥ 2 years) AND a follicle -stimulating hormone  
(FSH) value within the institution’s post -menopausal range  at screening  
• Hysterectomy OR bilateral oophorectomy  
• Tubal ligation at least 5 years prior to screening with no subsequent pregnancies  
Fertile female patients must practice a highly effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for 5 months following the last dose of study treatment. Highly effective contraception 
includes:  
• an intrauterine  device (IUD; alone or in combination with other birth control)  
• bilateral tubal occlusion  
• vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of 
childbearing potential study participant and that the vasectomized partner has  received 
medical assessment of the surgical success)  
 
Amendment  4 Page 41 of 102 Confidential  
  • sexual abstinence as defined as complete abstinence, acceptable only when it is the usual 
and preferred lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation metho ds) is not acceptable  
• Combination of any 2 of the following (a + b or a + c or b + c)  
a) Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other 
forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate 
< 1%) (e.g., hor mone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception)  
b) Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system  
c) Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) with spermicidal foam/gel/cream/vaginal supposito ry. 
Male patients  with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior 
vasectomy  with medical assessment of the surgical success  or agree to double -barrier methods of 
contraception during treatment, and for 90 days  after the last do se of either study treatment  to 
allow for clearance of any altered sperm.  
Patients will be instructed to notify the Investigator if pregnancy is discovered either during or 
within 5 months of the last dose of study treatment.  
4.5. Waivers of Inclusion/Exclusi on Criteria  
No waivers of these inclusion or exclusion criteria will be granted by the Investigator and the 
Sponsor o r its designee for any patient enrolling into the study.  
No deviations from the protocol should be initiated without prior discussion with Sponsor and 
written Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approval of an 
appropriate amendment, except when necessary to eliminate immediate haz ards to  the subjects.  
4.6. Criteria for Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients may withdraw voluntarily from participation in the study or from study treatment at any 
time and for any reason. A patient’s participation in the study may terminate at his/her request or 
on the basis of the Investigator’s clinical judgment. The reason for patient withdrawal will be 
documented in the source data and noted on the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
At a minimum, all patients who discontinue study treatment, includ ing those who refuse to return 
for a final visit, will be contacted for safety evaluations at the 30 -Day Safety Follow -up visit.  
If such withdrawal occurs, or if the patient fails to return for visits, the Investigator must 
determine the primary reason fo r a patient’s withdrawal from the study and record the 
information on the eCRF. If the reason for withdrawal is an AE, monitoring should continue 
until the outcome is evident. The specific event or test result(s) must be recorded in the eCRF. At 
the discre tion of the Sponsor, patients may also be removed from the study.  
It should be clearly documented in the source data whether patients withdrew their consent and 
will not enter the follow -up phase, or if patients withdrew their consent for study treatment b ut 
will continue further participation in the study. If patients withdraw consent for the survival 
follow -up phase, the study site is still obligated to follow the patient’s survival status through 
publicly available forms of information (i.e. death regist ries).  
 
Amendment  4 Page 42 of 102 Confidential  
  Treatment may be continued until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Progressive disease (PD): In patients with PD, a confirmatory scan should be performed 
at least 4  weeks later to confirm PD prior to removing the patient from study treatment. 
The confirmatory scan is recommended but not required, it is at the discretion of the 
treating physician  
• Intervening illness that prevents further administration of treatment.  
• Recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis  
• Unacceptable AE(s).  
• The patient, for any reason, re quires treatment with another therapeutic agent that has 
been demonstrated to be effective for treatment of the study indication. Discontinuation 
from study treatment will occur prior to introduction of the new agent.  
• Significant patient non -compliance wit h the protocol.  
• Completion of 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) with pembrolizumab.  
o Note: The number of treatments is calculated starting with the first dose of 
pembrolizumab.  
• Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for participants who have attain ed a 
confirmed complete response (CR) and have been treated for at least 8 cycles (at least 24 
weeks), beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.  
• Pregnancy.  
• Patient decision to withdraw from the study.  
• Investigator decision to withdraw the patient from the study.  
• Patient is lost to follow up.  
• Sponsor decision to end the study.

*The first 3-10 patients will receive 3mg/kg bavituximab, unless DLTs re quire  de-escalation (see Section  5.6). 
On days when both pembrolizumab and bavituximab are administered, pembrolizumab  will be 
administered first. After a window of at least 60 min utes, bavituximab will be administered.   In 
the absence of Grade 2 or greater hypersensitivity reactions, the window of time between the two 
infusion may be reduced to 30  minutes  after the first two cycles.  
Dose escalations from starting dose are not allowed  for bavituximab or pembrolizumab  
Bavituximab  must occur within a 3 day window of the scheduled treatment. O utside a 3 day 
window, such doses will be skipped and dosing will resume at the next scheduled time.   A 
missed dose due to holiday, bad weat her, or other unforeseen circums tances will not be not 
counted as a protocol deviation.  
A delay of a pembrolizumab dose due to holiday, weekend, bad weather, or other unforeseen 
circumstances will be permitted for a maximum of 7 days .  Outside of a 7 day d elay, the dose 
will be skipped and resumed at the next scheduled time.  
The safety outcome of the run -in phase will determine  the RDE for subsequent patients.  
Bavituximab dose may be reduced pending  DLT analysis of the first 3 to 10 patients  (See 
Section  5.6).  
Patients enrolled in the safety run - in phase t he dose of bavituximab will be adjusted or 
interrupted as appropriate ; see Section  5.6 
Patients enrolled in the expansion phase (once RDE is de termined ) may not have a reduction in 
the dose of bavituximab.  The dose of bavituximab will be interrupted as appropriate, see Section 
5.7 and Table 6. 
No dose reductions of pembrolizumab  are permitt ed. Doses will be withheld as appropriate based 
on treatment modifications  defined in Table 7. 
 
Amendment  4 Page 44 of 102 Confidential  
  Administration of bavituximab and pembrolizumab will be performed in a setting with 
emergency medical facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical 
emergencies.  
If continued treatment with bavituximab is contraindicated due to AEs, the patient may continue 
treatment with pembrolizumab after consultation with the medical monitor . If continued 
treatment with pembrolizumab is contraind icated due to AEs, bavituximab administration may 
continue upon consultation with the medical monitor.  
5.2. Description of Bavituximab  
Bavituximab is a chimeric (human/mouse) version derived from the original murine PS -targeting 
mAb 3G4. It is a genetically engineered immunoglobulin gamma 1 -kappa (IgG1)κ consisting of 
human IgG1κ constant regions linked by recombinant deoxyribonucleic aci d (DNA) techniques 
to murine 3G4 var iable regions . 
Bavituximab is supplied as a sterile, preservative -free solution with a composition of 
bavituximab, in 10 mM acetate, pH 5.0. It is provided in borosilicate Type 1 glass vials and 
stored at 2°C to 8°C cont aining 120  mg/5mL (24mg/mL).  
Vials containing bavituximab drug product will be labeled according to national regulations for 
investigational products.  
5.3. Description of Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a PD -1 blocking antibody . 
Pembrolizumab is supplied as 100  mg/4  mL (25 mg/mL) solution in a single -dose vial.  
Pembrolizumab vials should not be used beyond the expiration date provided by the 
manufacturer. Each  vial is intended for single use only. Vial contents should not be frozen or 
shaken and should be protect ed from direct sunlight.  
5.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
Patients will be enrolled through an interactive web response system (IWRS).  
5.5. Preparation and Administration of Study Treatment  
5.5.1.  Bavituximab  
The Investigator or designee will be respo nsible for administering the appropriate dose of IV 
bavituximab to all patients. Bavituximab must be stored at 2°C to 8°C in its original package.   
Infusion reactions have occurred both with and without premedication, and it is unclear whether 
the type of co-administered chemotherapy or premedication with steroids and antihistamines 
impacts the frequency or severity of infusion reactions. Reports of infusion reactions will 
continue to be monitored. Prior to each bavituximab infusion, the patient should be premedicated 
with an antihistamine to decrease the  risk of an infusion reaction . A recommended regimen is 50 
mg diphenhydramine IV and 325 mg acetaminophen  orally ( PO) administered  1.5 hours ( ± 30 
minutes)  prior to infusion . See Section 6.2 for full recommendations for IRRs.  The regimen, 
dosages, and timing of the premedications can be adjusted at the Investigator’s discretion.  
 
Amendment  4 Page 45 of 102 Confidential  
  The bavituximab d osage is calculated at 0.125 mL/kg body weight and diluted with normal 
saline to a volume of no less than 100 mL. The total dose will not be recalculated based on body 
weight unless there is a ≥ 10% change in weight from Day 1. Administer as  IV with in -line 
0.2 m filter over 90 minutes once weekly. A fter the 1st infusion, in the absence of Grade 2 or 
greater hypersensitivity reactions, the infusion time will be reduced to 60 minutes. After a 2nd 
infusion, in the absence of Grade 2 or greater hypersensitivity reactions, the infusion time will be 
reduced to 30 minutes.  
The individual bavituximab infusion will be prepared under aseptic conditions and administered 
at the study site, according to the directions of the Sponsor, which will be provided in a 
Pharmacy Manual. In general, a vial of bavituximab must be used as soon as possible after 
reaching room temperature. Any solution remaining in the vial must be discarded. After dilution 
for infusion, a dministration of bavituximab should take place as soon as possible. Maximum 
allowed storage times and conditions will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Bavituximab is administered as an infusion. Bavituximab should not be administered as an IV 
push or bo lus. 
5.5.2.  Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab will be administered using IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3 -week treatment cycle 
after all procedures and assessments have been completed. Bavituximab compound to be 
administered post administration of pembrolizumab.  
Pembrolizumab will be administered as a dose of 200 mg using a 30 -minute IV infusion.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window between -5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes ( -5 min/+10 min). This is an open -
label study; study treatments will not be blinded.  
5.6. DLT Dose De -escalation/Modification  
Patients who complete the DLT  observation period  without a DLT will continue study treatment 
until a criterion for discontinuation is met ( Section  4.6). See Section  5.7 for information about 
administration of bavituximab dose modifications for patients who continue on study treatment 
after they complete the DLT observati on period.  
If the patient experiences a DLT during the DLT observation  period (see Secti on 3.1), dosing of 
bavituximab and pembrolizumab must be interrupted, as shown in Table  2. If a DLT resolves to 
Grade  1, dosing may be resumed at the next available reduced dose level  for bavituximab or 
the same dose for pembrolizumab  if agreed to b y the I nvestigator and the Sponsor’s  medical 
monitor . If the patient was on the lowest dose level of bavituximab when the DLT occurred, they 
must be discontinued from the study.  No intra -patient dose re-escalation is allowed  after a dose 
reduction .

A patient will be considered evaluable for DLTs if he or she (1) receives at least one dose of 
either study treatment  and completes the DLT observation period or (2) discontinues because of 
a DLT. A patient will be considered nonevaluable for DLTs if he or  she discontinues during the 
DLT observation period for a reason other than a DLT; patients who are not evaluable for DLTs 
will be replaced.  
The first 3 patients will be evaluated for DLTs for the purpose of declaring the tentative RDE. 
The SRC will revie w these patients for DLTs at the end of the first 3 -week cycle:  
• If 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT on any dose level, the RDE will be tentatively 
declared and further dose expansion will continue.  
• If 1of 3 patients experiences a DLT on any dose level, that cohort will be expanded to 
6 patients. If 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT, the RDE will be tentatively declared and 
further dose expansion will continue.  
• If ≥ 2 of 3 or ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT on Dose Level 0, D ose Level -1 will be  
explored. If ≥ 2 of 3 or ≥ 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT on Dose Leve l -1, Dose 
Level -2 will be explored.  
• If  2 DLT(s ) occur  in up to 6 patients at Dose Level -2, further enrollment and dosing 
will be stopped until there is a full review of all avai lable data, including PK, by the SRC.

The SRC may decide to meet at any time to evaluate a dosing cohort if a safety signal arises or 
other data become available to justify re -evaluation of the dosing cohort before it is fully 
enrolled.  
Patients who are lost to follow up or withdraw consent f or study participation prior to receiving 
study treatment or who withdraw prior to completing Cycle 1 for reasons other than DLT may be 
replaced . Approximately ten patients will be evaluated for safety by SRC, even if no DLTs have 
been identified to ensure  early safety monitoring of the combination . 
5.6.1.  Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
A DLT is defined as any of the AEs described below that occurs during the DLT observation 
period and is at least possibly related to bavituximab or pembrolizumab. The Inves tigator will 
use CTCAE v5.0 guidelines to assign an AE term and severity grade relevant to the DLT.  
Hematological toxicities as follows:  
o Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days, except thrombocytopenia:  
 
Amendment  4 Page 47 of 102 Confidential  
  ▪ Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration  
▪ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding  
o  Grade 3 febrile neutropenia  
▪ Grade 3 is defined as ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3 
degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥38 degrees C 
(100.4 degre es F) for more than 1 hour  
▪ Grade 4 is defined as ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3 
degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥38 degrees C 
(100.4 degrees F) for more than 1 hour, with life -threatening consequences 
and urgent in tervention indicated.  
o Grade 4 lymphocyte decreases lasting > 14 days  
 
Non-hematologic toxicities:  
o Any nonhematologic AE ≥Grade 3 in severity should be considered a DLT, with the 
following exceptions: Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 3 days; Grade 3 diarrhea, naus ea, or 
vomiting without use of anti -emetics or anti -diarrheals per standard of care; Grade 3 rash 
without use of corticosteroids or anti -inflammatory agents per standard of care.  
o Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematologic laboratory value if:  
▪ Clinically significant medical intervention is required to treat the subject, 
or 
▪ The abnormality leads to hospitalization, or  the abnormality persists for 
>1 week ; the abnormality results in a Drug -induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
▪ Exceptions: Clinically nonsig nificant, treatable, or reversible laboratory 
abnormalities including liver function tests, uric acid, etc.  
o Prolonged delay (>2  weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment -related toxicity.  
o Any treatment -related toxicity that causes the participant to di scontinue treatment during 
Cycle 1.  
o Missing >25% of planned d oses as a result of drug -related AE(s) during the first cycle.  
o Grade 5 toxicity.  
 
Isolated laboratory changes without associated clinical signs or symptoms may not be included 
in this definition.  These findings will be discussed and reviewed by the Investigators and the 
Sponsor’s medical monitor.  
Safety data in subsequent cycles will also be monitored on an ongoing basis to determine the 
cumulative incidence of late -onset toxicities.  
 
Amendment  4 Page 48 of 102 Confidential  
  Patients who experience a DLT, but in the opinion of the Investigator can be adequately 
monitored for recurrence of the toxicity and are otherwise experiencing clinical benefit, may be 
offered continued treatment with bavituximab and pembrolizumab.  
Dosing will continue until criteria for study treatment discontinuation are met (unacceptable 
toxicity, PD, or withdrawal from the study) or up to a maximum of 35 cycles.  
5.7. Dose Modification Guidelines  
CTCAE v5.0 must be used to grade the severity of AEs.  
If appro priate, the Investigator may attribute each toxicity event to either bavituximab or 
pembrolizumab alone or in combination.  
Bavituximab Dose Reductions:  Once RDE derived from the DLT observation period is 
established, bavituximab doses may not be reduced.  
Bavituximab Dose Interruptions:  Treatment with bavituximab  may be interrupted for  up to 
21 days ( 1 cycle ) for toxicity or reasons unrelated to toxicity. If bavituximab  is withheld because 
of AEs for  21 days, then the patient will be discontinued from bavituximab . If, in the judgment 
of the Investigator, the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit from bavituximab  after a hold of 
 21 days, study drug may be restarted with the approval of the medical monitor.  
Recommendations for bavituximab  dose modifications for the management of specific AEs are 
presented in Section  6.3. 
Pembrolizumab Dose Reductions:  Dose reductions of pembrolizumab are not permitted.  
Pembrolizumab Dose Interruptions:  Treatment with pembrolizumab may be temporarily 
suspended for up to 12 we eks (3 cycles) beyond the last dose to allow for resolution of immune -
related AEs and tapering of corticosteroids.  
If a patient must be tapered off steroids used to treat AEs, pembrolizumab  may be with held for 
up to 12 weeks from the last dose until stero ids are discontinued or reduced to prednisone dose  
equivalent  10 mg/day. The acceptable length of interruption will depend on an agreement 
between the Investigator and the medical monitor.  
Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than toxicity, such as sur gical procedures, may be allowed 
with medical monitor approval. The acceptable length of interruption will depend on agreement 
between the Investigator and the medical monitor.  
5.8. Treatment Compliance  
The study treatments will be administered to subjects at t he study site, under the supervision of 
the Investigator or designee in accordance with the protocol. Compliance with schedule infusions 
during study visits will be recorded on the CRF.  
5.9. Study Drug Accountability  
Study personnel will maintain accurate reco rds of study treatment shipments/receipts and 
administration. The site is responsible for the return or destruction of study treatment as required.  
 
Amendment  4 Page 49 of 102 Confidential  
  5.10. Concomitant Medications  
Patients are allowed to continue the medications that they are taking at baseline. Patients may 
also receive concomitant medications that are medically indicated as standard care for the 
treatment of symptoms and intercurrent illnesses. Medications to trea t concomitant diseases, e.g., 
diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) are allowed. Patients 
may also receive therapy to mitigate side effects of the study medication as clinically indicated, 
as well as best supportive care as per institutional guidelines. This may include, e.g., 
anti-emetics, antidiarrheals, anticholinergics, antispasmodics, antipyretics, antihistamines, 
analgesics, antibiotics, and other medications intended to treat symptoms. The Investigator 
should instru ct the patient not to take any additional medications (including over -the-counter 
products) during the study without prior consultation.   
All concomitant medications received within 28 days  prior to the first dose of study treatment 
and up to 30 days after  the last dose of study treatment should be recorded. Concomitant 
medications administered 30 days after the last dose of study treatment should be recorded for 
SAEs and AESIs,  
5.11. Premedication for Infusion Reactions  
Routine premedication (e.g., diphenhydrami ne and acetaminophen) is required prior to infusion 
of bavituximab  (Section  5.5.1 ). Management of infusion -related reactions is described in 
Section  6.2. 
5.12. Corticosteroid Use  
Systemi c corticosteroids and tumor TNF -α inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with bavituximab and pembrolizumab but may be administered 
at the discretion of the treating physician. If feasible, alternatives to corticoste roids should be 
considered. The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for 
patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed. Megestrol 
administered as an appetite stimulant is acceptabl e while the patient is enrolled in the study.  
5.13. Hematopoietic Growth Factor and Blood Products  
Erythropoietin, darbepoetin alfa, and/or hematopoietic colony -stimulating factors for treatment 
of cytopenias should be administered according to institutional gui delines. Prophylactic use of 
these agents is not permitted.  
Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be in accordance with institutional 
guidelines.  
5.14. Prohibited Therapies  
Listed below are specific restrictions for concomitant therapy or vaccina tion during the course of 
the study:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 
Amendment  4 Page 50 of 102 Confidential  
  • Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy  
Note:   Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be allowed 
at the investigator’s discretion.  
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of study treatment , while participating 
in the study , and for 4 months following the last dose of either pembrolizumab or 
bavituximab, whichever is later . Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typho id vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus 
vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live 
attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose o ther than to modulate symptoms from an AE 
that is suspected to have an immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Medical Monitor   
 
Note: Inhaled steroids are allowed for management of asthma.  
 
Participants who, in the assessment of the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a participant ’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care.  
5.15. Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1000 mg or 
≥5 times the indicat ed dose.    
For this study and overdose of bavituximab will be defined as any dose of 15mg/kg or ≥5 times 
the indicated dose.    
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of bavituximab or 
pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed  closely for signs of 
toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
In the event of a known or suspected overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate 
hematology and clinical c hemistry and should receive supportive therapy, as necessary. Please 
also refer to Section  6.3 for guidelines on the management of potential study treatment -related 
toxicities.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications for bavituximab and/or pembrolizumab 
(interruptions only) in the case of a suspected overdose will be made by the Investigator in 
consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the patient.  
 
Amendment  4 Page 51 of 102 Confidential  
  A plasma sample for PK analysis may be requested by the medical monitor or Sponsor on a case -
by-case basis. This plasma sample should be collected as soon as possible, but within 10  days 
from  the date of the last dose of on -study dosing.  
Information regarding the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing 
should be documented in the appropriate eCRF.  
 
Amendment  4 Page 52 of 102 Confidential  
  6. MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF EXPECTED OR 
POTENTIAL TREATMENT -RELATE D TOXICITY  
6.1. Patient Monitoring  
Staff administering study drug are required to closely monitor all patients for possible systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions (e .g., generalized exanthema, urticaria, paraesthesia, 
bronchoconstriction, palpitations)  during and after the first infusion of both study drugs.  
All systemic hypersensitivity manifestations will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page(s) 
and identified as being due to a hypersensitivity reaction.  
6.2. Management of Infusion Reactions – Bavituximab and 
Pembr olizumab  
Patients who experience infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or famotidine or another H2 receptor 
antagonist, as per standard practice.  
Precautions for anaphylaxis should be observed during both bavituximab and pembrolizumab 
administration. Vital signs should be measured as outlined in Section  7.1.10  during both 
bavituximab and pembrolizumab infusions. All supportive measures consistent with optimal 
patient care will be provided throughout the study acco rding to institution standards. Emergency 
resuscitation equipment and medications should be readily available. Addi tional supportive 
measures should also be available and may include, but are not limited to, epinephrine, 
antihistamines, corticosteroids, IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, 
diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen (paracetamol).  
Infusion -related reactions (IRRs) wi ll be defined according to Table  4.

Amendment 4 Page 56 of 102 Confidential  
 6.3. Bavituximab Expected or Potential Treatment -related Toxicities  
6.3.1.  Management of Thromboembolic Events  
Very high doses of bavituximab (100 mg/kg) in animals have been associated with evidence of 
minimal to mild thrombi (see bavituximab IB). Although it is known that tumor disease causes 
thromboembolic events, it is unknown whether treatment with bavituximab  in the doses utilized 
in this study poses an increased risk of thrombosis in humans. Therefore, the Investigator should 
maintain a high degree of vigilance for thrombotic events in study patients.  
Should thrombotic or thromboembolic events be suspected a t any time after the start of 
bavituximab treatment, whether on the basis of clinical signs or symptoms, abnormalities of 
platelets, aPTT, PT, or d -dimer results, or some combination of abnormalities and/or clinical 
findings, additional diagnostic and/or t herapeutic measures shoul d be undertaken without delay. 
Evaluation and management of such events should include Doppler examination and 
consideration of additional coagulation studies, imaging studies as appropriate, as well as 
consideration of treatment w ith low -molecular -weight heparin (LMWH) and/or transfusion of 
blood products as appropriate. Events that meet seriousness criteria should be repo rted to and 
discussed with the medical m onitor (as with any other SAEs).  
6.3.2.  Management of Other Adverse Events  
For dose modifications of bavituximab based on the occurrence of related AEs, see Table 6. 
Table 6: Bavituximab Dose Reductions for Treatment -Related Adverse Events  
Severity of 
Event  Dose Adjustment for Bavituximab  
Grade 1  Maintain bavituximab dose level and provide treatment to control symptoms, if 
applicable.  
Grade 2 
(tolerable)  Maintain bavituximab dose level and provide treatment to control symptoms, if 
applicable.  
Grade 2 
(intolerable)  Hold administration of bavituximab until the AE recovers to Grade 0 -1 or to 
pretreatment baseline AE level, whichever is more abnormal. Then, resume treatment.  
Grade 3  Hold admin istration of bavituximab until the AE recovers to Grade 0 -1 or to 
pretreatment baseline AE level, whichever is more abnormal.  
Grade 4  Discontinue  
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event.  
6.4.  Dose modification and toxicity management for immune -related 
AEs associated with pembrolizumab  
AEs associated with pembrolizumab  exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs ) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab  treatment and may affect more than on body system simultaneously. 
Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. Based 
on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with 
interruptions of pembrolizumab , administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. 
For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. 
 
Amendment 4 Page 57 of 102 Confidential  
 Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as 
part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue 
pembrolizumab  and administer corticosteroids . Dose modification and toxicity management 
guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab  are provided in Table 7 .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amendment 4 Page 58 of 102 Confidential  
 Table  7: Management of Potential Pembrolizumab Toxicities  
General instructions:  
1. Severe and life -threatening irAEs should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by oral steroids. Other immunosuppressive treatment shou ld 
begin if the irAEs are not controlled by corticosteroids.  
2. Pembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued if the irAE does not resolve or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10  mg/day within 12 weeks of the 
last pembrolizumab treatme nt.  
3. The corticosteroid ta per should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade 1 and continue at least 4 weeks.  
4. If pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab may resume after the irAE decreased to ≤  Grade  1 after corticosteroid taper.

NOTE:  
For participants with Grade 3 or 4 immune -related endocrinopathy where withhold of pembrolizumab  is required, 
pembrolizumab  may be resumed when AE resolves to ≤ Grade 2 and is controlled with hormonal replacement therapy or 
achieved metabolic control (in c ase of T1DM).   
 
The Investigator should consider the benefit −risk balance a given patient may be experiencing prior to  further administration of 
pembrolizumab. In patients who have met the criteria for permanent discontinuation, resumption of pembrolizum ab may be 
considered if the patient is deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the immune -related event. Patients can  be re -challenged with 
pembrolizumab only after approval has been documented by both the Investigator (or an  appropriate delegate) an d the medical 
monitor.

  n The first on -study tumor  imaging will be performed 6 weeks (±7 days) after initiation of treatment and then every 6 weeks (±7 days) thereafter (or more 
frequently if clinically indicated). Timing of imaging follows calendar days and should not be adjusted due to dose interrupt ions. The same imaging 
technique, acquisition, and processing parameters for a subject should be used throughout the trial.  
o Subjects without confirmed PD who discontinue treatment will have imaging performed at the time study treatment is discontinu ed (i.e. date of 
discontinuation ± 4 -week window). If a scan was obtained within 4 weeks prior to discontinuation of treatment, then imaging at treatment disconti nuation is 
not required. Continue to monitor disease  status as indicated in Section  7.2.1.3 .  
P Vital signs will be captured approximately 30 minutes prior to pembrolizumab; 30 minutes prior to bavituximab  administration and within  60 minutes post 
bavituxumab

be performed at baseline only. During the treatment phase, a chest CT will be performed as 
clinically indicated;  
Urinalysis ; 
Urine or serum pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential only).  
Pre-Treatment - Biomarker Tissue Biopsy (Required)  
After obtaining informed consent, the fresh tumor biopsy must be obtained prior to initial 
treatment (C1D1) , and can be since progression of last treatment . Archival formalin fixed 
paraffin embedded tumor tissue is requested  from any early tissue sample for same  disease , as 
well.  
7.1.2.  Treatment Phase  
Study Treatment  
Patients will be treated with bavituximab (3  mg/kg IV weekly) and pembrolizumab (200 mg IV 
Q3W ). Patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or 
discontinuation from the study treatment due to any other reason. For details of assessment, refer

Amendment 4 Page 69 of 102 Confidential  
 7.1.3.  Post – Treatment Follow -up Phase  
7.1.3.1.  End of Treatment  
Patients who discontinue both study treatments should be scheduled for an EOT visit within 
15 days following the last dose date of study treatment, at which time all the assessments listed 
for the EOT visit will be performed. For detai ls of the assessment, see Table  8.  
An optional fresh tumor biopsy is requested for patients who discontinue due to PD  
At a minimum, all patients who discontinue study treatment, including those who refuse to return 
for a final visit, will be contacted for study ev aluations during the 30 days following the last dose 
date of study treatment.  
 
7.1.3.2.  30-Day Safety Follow -Up Visit  
All patients will be followed up for safety up to 30 days after last dose of study drug 
(bavituximab and pembrolizumab) treatment. Patients whose t reatment is interrupted or 
permanently discontinued due to an AE, including abnormal laboratory value, must be followed 
until resolution or stabilization of the event, whichever comes first.  
The Investigator will review all new anti-cancer therapy initiate d after the last dose of trial 
treatment. If a subject initiates a new anti -cancer therapy within 30 days after the last dose of trial 
treatment, the 30 -day Safety Follow -up V isit must occur before the first dose of the new therapy. 
Once new anti -cancer th erapy has been initiated the subject will move into survival  follow -up. 
7.1.3.3.  Survival Follow -up 
Patients will be followed for survival every 12 weeks after the 30 -Day Safety Follow -up Visit. 
Telephone contacts will be documented every 12 weeks to confirm survival, withdrawal of 
consent, lost to follow -up or to notify patient of the end of the study, whichever occurs first.  
At least 3 documented attempts should be made to contact the patient before the patient is 
considered lost to follow -up.  
If patients withdraw consent for the survival follow -up phase, the study site is still obligated to 
follow the   patient’s  survival status through publicly available forms of information (i.e. death 
registries).  
7.1.4.  Beginning and End of the Trial  
The study begins when the first patient signs the informed consent. The end of the study may be 
designated as a ma ximum of 12 months from the last patient receiving the last dose of study 
therapy or the time point when all patients have discontinued the study, whichever is sooner.  
7.1.5.  Informed Consent  
The investigator or qualified designee must obtain documented consent  from each potential 
patient or each patient’s legally acceptable representative prior to participating in a clinical trial.  
Consent must be documented by the patient’s dated signature on a consent form along with the 
dated signature of the person conduct ing the consent discussion.   
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 70 of 102 Confidential  
 A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the patient prior to trial 
participation.   
The Investigator is responsible for:  
• ensuring that the patient understands the potential risks and benefits of partici pating in 
the study  
• ensuring that informed consent is given by each patient or legal representative. This 
includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the ICF prior to the 
performance of any study procedures and prior to the administration o f study treatment.  
• answering any questions the patient may have throughout the study and sharing in a 
timely manner any new information that may be relevant to the patient’s willingness to 
continue his or her participation in the trial.  
7.1.6.  Ethical Review  
Documentation of IEC/IRB approval of the protocol , ICF and any other patient materials must be 
provided to Oncologie, Inc . or its representative before the study may begin at the investigative 
site(s). Oncologie, Inc . or its representatives must approve the ICF, inc luding any changes made 
by the IEC/IRBs, before it is used at the investigative site(s). All ICFs must be compliant with 
the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for GCP ) and local regulat ions.  
7.1.7.  Adverse Event Assessment  
The Investigator has the responsibility for assessing the safety of the patients and for compliance 
with the protocol to ensure study integrity. Patients will be monitored for AEs during study 
participation (beginning after i nformed consent is signed) and until 30  days after the last dose of 
study treatment. Any ongoing SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization. AEs and 
laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the CTCAE v5.0 grading system and 
record ed on the eCRF.  
Complete details for monitoring AEs, including the definition of drug -related AEs, are provided 
in Section  8. 
7.1.8.  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the Investigator or qualified designee to 
ensure that the subject qualifies for the trial.  
7.1.9.  Demographic/Medical History/Prior Treatments  
Patient demographics and significant medical history including prior tr eatments will be recorded 
by the Investigator or qualified designee. Medical history will include all active conditions and 
any condition diagnosed within the last 10 years that are considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator. Details regarding t he patient’s gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be recorded 
separately and NOT listed as medical history.   
If patient has lost at least 15 pounds over the three months prior to screening, “weight loss” 
should be considered an active condition and noted in  Medical History. Autoimmune disorders, 
regardless of onset date, should be recorded.

 7.1.10.  Vital Signs  
The Investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of  each dose of bavituximab  and again prior to administration of each do se of 
pembrolizumab,  and at treatment discontinuation . Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, 
respiratory rate, weight and blood pressure. Height will be measured at screening only.  
Vital signs will be captured a pproximately 30 minutes prior to pembrolizumab; 30 minutes prior 
to bavituximab  administration  and within 60 minutes  post bavituxumab  
7.1.11.  Weight and Height  
Height will be measured only during screening. Weight will be measured at Day 1 of each cycle. 
The patient should be in light indoor clothes.  
7.1.12.  Full Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will include an assessment of all the major body systems. A compl ete 
physical examination will be performed at the time points specified in Table  8. Clinically 
significant abnormal findings noted during screening pe riod should be recorded as medical 
history.  
7.1.13.  Directed Physical Exam  
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per Table  8, the Investigator  or qualified 
designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to dosing on Day 1 
of each treatment cycle. New c linically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs.  
7.1.14.  ECOG Performance Status  
ECOG performance status w ill be assessed at the time points specified in Table  8. Care will be 
taken to accurately score performance status, especially during screening f or study eligibility 
purposes. Additional consideration should be given to borderline ECOG performance status to 
avoid enrolling patients with significant impairment.  
7.1.15.  12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed using local  standard procedures once at screening. 
Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history. Additional time 
points may be performed as clinically necessary.  
7.1.16.  Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected at the  time points specified in Table  8. Screening 
results for study eligibility should be performed within 72 hours prior to first dose of treatment . 
Addi tional clinical laboratory tests can be obtained at any time during the study at the 
Investigator’s discretion. Local laboratories will perform the assessments.  
All blood and urine collections for clinical laboratory tests occurring on the same day as stud y 
treatment administration must be performed prior to study treatment administration and 
Investigator must review results to ensure acceptability prior to initiating each new cycle of 
treatment.

hours) prior to treatment.  If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum 
pregnancy test will be required.  
A pregnancy test must be repeated prior to dosing on Day 1 of every cycle and at the end of 
treatment visit. Pregnancy tests (serum and/or urine tests) should be repeated prior to dosing on 
Day 1 of every cycle in the UK.  In all other countries pregnancy  tests should be repeated as 
required by local guidelines .

Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 73 of 102 Confidential  
 If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with study treatment, the subject 
will immediately be removed from the study. The site will contact the subject at least monthly 
and document the subject's status until the pregnancy has been c ompleted or terminated. The 
outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor without delay and within 24 hours if 
the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life -threatening complic ation to the mother or newborn). The study Investigator will 
make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the 
conditi on of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. If a male patient impregnates his female 
partner the  study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported 
to the Sponsor and followed as described above and in Section  8.5. 
7.2. Efficacy Assessments  
7.2.1.  Tumor Assessments  
Tumor response and progression will be assessed by the Investigator according to  RECIST, 
Version 1.1 ( Appendix A ). Tumor assessments, including tumor markers, will be performed at 
the time points specified in Table  8. 
Tumor assessments should consist of clinical examination and appropriate imaging techniques 
(preferably CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with appropriate slice thickness per 
RECIST); other studies (MRI, X -ray, positron emission tomography [PET] scan, and ultrasound) 
may be performed if required. The same methods used to detect lesions at baseline are to be used 
to follow the same les ions throughout the clinical study. Investigators should perform scans of 
the anatomical sites that, in their judgment, are appropriate to assess based on each patient’s 
tumor status.  
7.2.1.1.  Baseline Tumor Imaging  
To meet screening criteria, baseline tumor imagin g must be performed within 28 days prior to 
the first dose of study treatment.  
Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the baseline 
scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days prior to the fi rst dose of study 
treatment.  
7.2.1.2.  Tumor Imaging During  Trial  
Tumor imaging  will be conducted every 6 weeks (± 7 days) after initiation of treatment . until one 
of the following occurs:  
• disease progression  
• start of new anti -cancer  treatment  
• withdrawal of  consent  
• death  
• end of study  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 74 of 102 Confidential  
 Imaging should follow calendar days and not be delayed for any dose interruptions that may 
occur.  
7.2.1.3.  Timing of Repeat Imaging  
In patients with PD, a confirmatory scan should be performed at least 4  weeks later to confirm 
PD prior to removi ng the patient from study treatment. The confirmatory scan is recommended 
but not required, it is at the discretion of the treating physician.  
Per RECIST 1.1, response should be confirmed by a repeat radiographic assessment not less than 
4 weeks from the d ate the response was first documented. The scan for confirmation of response 
must be performed at the earliest 4 weeks after the first indication of response, or at the next 
scheduled scan (6 weeks later), whichever is clinically indicated.  
7.3. Immunogenicity Assessments  
7.3.1.  Antidrug Antibody Assessments  
Venous blood samples for the assessment of ADA levels will be drawn at the time points 
presented in Table  9 for bavituximab .  
Blood samples should be collected from the arm opposite from the investigational drug 
infusion, or from another site if collected within 24 hours of dosing.   
Residual ADA se rum samples used for ADA analysis may also be used for exploratory PK 
and/or pharmacodynamic analyses related to bavituximab treatment. This could include using 
leftover serum for exploratory, alternative PK assay development and analysis.  
ADA samples will  also be collected in the event of a clinically significant AE (such as infusion 
reaction/anaphylaxis) or if ADA is suspected, at which time those samples could be used to 
measure any relevant biomarkers, to understand the infusion reaction/adverse event b etter. After 
the primary clinical study report data cut -off date is reached, no additional ADA samples will be 
collected for the patients still on -going on the study.  
In the event of an IRR, blood samples will  be collected for both PK and ADA  at the follow ing 
time points: (i) as soon as possible after the onset of the IRR, (ii) at the resolution of the IRR, and 
(iii) 30 days (±3 days) following the IRR.  
Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for details on collection and processing of blood ADA 
samples.  
7.4. Phar macokinetic Assessments  
7.4.1.  Blood Sample Collection  
Venous blood samples for the PK analysis of bavituximab  will be drawn at the time points 
presented in Table  9. 
Blood samples should be collected from the arm opposite from the investigational drug 
infusion, or from another site if collected within 24 hours of dosing.

Amendment 4 Page 75 of 102 Confidential  
 Residual PK serum samples used f or PK analysis may also be used for exploratory PK and/or PD 
analyses related to bavituximab treatment. This could include using leftover serum for 
exploratory, alternative PK assay development and analysis.  
In the event of an IRR, blood samples will  be co llected for both PK and ADA  at the following 
time points: (i) as soon as possible after the onset of the IRR, (ii) at the resolution of the IRR, and 
(iii) 30 days (±3 days) following the IRR.  
7.4.2.  Sample Analysis  
PK parameters will be determined for bavituximab  and pembrolizumab using non -
compartmental methods. Possible compartmental analysis and possible relationships between PK 
and pharmacodynamic variables, efficacy and/or selected toxicities will be explored, as 
appropriate.  
PK profiles to assess PK properti es of single -agent bavituximab will be collected from all 
enrolled patients.  
PK and ADA samples will also be collected in the event of a clinically significant AE (such as 
infusion reaction/anaphylaxis) or if ADA is suspected, at which time those samples could be 
used to measure any relevant biomarkers, to understand the infusion reaction/adverse event 
better. After the primary clinical study report data cut -off date is reached, no additional PK and 
ADA samples will be collected for the patients still on -going on the study.  
Central laboratories will be used for bioanalysis of study drug in human serum. Please refer to 
the Laboratory Manual for details on collection and processing of blood PK samples.  
7.5. Biomarker Assessments  
7.5.1.  Tumor Biopsies  
Patients must be con sented for a mandatory fresh tissue biopsy to be performed in order to enroll 
in this trial. The fresh tumor biopsy must be prior to initial treatment (C1D1). If available, 
archival samples will also be collected. An optional fresh tumor biopsy is requested at the EOT 
for patients who discontinue due to PD  
The baseline fresh tumor tissu e will be used to investigate potential response -predictive 
biomarkers. Those biomarkers include immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well as RNA 
signatures .The signatures g enerated will  have the potential to inform patient stratification 
strateg ies for future trials. See the Laboratory Manual for sample processing details.   
Patient tissue samples will be assessed to determine 4 unique  RNA signatures as well as whole 
exome sequencing for exploratory  analysi s. The putative RNA signatures will be analyzed  to 
determine whether any  correlate to response to the combination treatment.  Classifying patients 
to these  four putative signatures will be derived from an  expanded gene set  from that described 
in Uhlik et at  2016  and a unique classif ier algorithm . These four classification signatures 
encompass   immunological and angiogenic characteristics  in the tumor stroma.  If patients with  a  
particular signature /s  are more responsive to this combination treatment, future studies  may be 
planned to select patients .   .  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 76 of 102 Confidential  
 Residual sample material available after completion of the designated analyses may be used in 
the future for identification of predictive markers or to enhance understanding of disease biology 
unless prohibited by local laws or regulations.  
7.5.2.  Biomarker Blood Samples  
All patients will have venous blood samples drawn at the time points specified  in Table  9 for 
blood biomarkers  including, but not limited to,  immunomodulating  cytokines and related factors .  
Complete instructions for processing, handling and shipment of blood samples will be provided 
in the Lab oratory Manual.  
8. ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT  
8.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
8.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
Patients will be monitored for all AEs from the time the first dose of study  treatment  is 
administered through 30 days after the last dose of s tudy treatment. All AEs  that occur from the 
signing of the ICF until the first dose of study treatment should be recorded on the AE eCRF 
page only if the event was related to a study procedure. Study procedure -related AEs that occur 
after signing of the ICF and before administration of study treatment will also be collected.  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the worsening of a pre -existing 
medical condition following or during expos ure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not 
considered causally related to the study treatment.  
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., baseline, treatment, 
washout, or follow -up), and at an y dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following:  
Results in death  
It is immediately life -threatening  
It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
It results in pe rsistent or significant disability or incapacity  
Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
8.2. Clarifica tions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Death is an outcome of an SAE and not an SAE in itself. When death is an outcome, report the 
event(s) resulting in death as the SAE term (e.g., “pulmonary embolism”). If the cause of death is 
unknown, report “Death,  unknown cause” as the SAE term.  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 77 of 102 Confidential  
 Pre-planned or elective hospitalizations including social and/or convenience situations (e.g. 
respite care) are excluded from SAE reporting. In addition, emergency room visits and admission 
under 23 -hour observation are exc luded from SAE reporting; however, such events should still 
be reported on the appropriate AE eCRF page.  
Events of progression of the patient’s underlying cancer as well as events clearly related to 
progression of the patient’s cancer (signs and symptoms o f progression) should not be reported 
as a SAE unless the outcome is fatal during the study or within the safety reporting period. If the 
event has a fatal outcome during the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event 
causing the death mus t be recorded as an AE and as a SAE with CTC Grade 5 (fatal outcome) 
indicated. The AE/SAE term of Disease Progression should only be used when the Investigator 
is not able to distinguish the actual event that caused the death.  
Serious adverse events speci fically related to subsequent anticancer therapies administered 
during the 30 -day Safety Follow -up period are excluded from SAE reporting, as are 
hospitalizations for the administration of such therapy.  If it is not known whether the SAE is 
related to the subsequent anticancer therapy, the SAE should be reported.  
8.3. Assessment of Causality  
The relationship of each AE to the study treatment (bavituximab and pembrolizumab) 
administration will be assessed by the Investigator after careful consideration of all rel evant 
factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, 
concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, temporal relationship to receipt of 
the study medication and de -challenge or re -challenge according  to the following guidelines:  
YES (possible, probably or definitely related): there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug.  
The e vent could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
state, environment or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug.  
The eve nt disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug. In some 
situations, an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of the study 
drug despite other clear indications of relatedness.  
NO (not related or  definitely not related): There is no reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug.  
The event could be  reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factor or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient.  
The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug .  
The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and 
it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re -administered.

 8.4. Assessment of Severity  
The severity rating of an AE refers to its intensity. The sev erity of each AE will be categorized 
using the NCI CTCAE v5.0. For any term that is not specifically listed in the CTCAE scale, 
intensity should be assigned a grade of 1 through 5 using the following CTCAE guidelines:  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE  
It is important to distinguish b etween serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria unde r Section  8.1.2 . An AE of severe intensity may 
not be considered serious.  
8.5. Pregnancy or Drug Exposure during Pregnancy  
If a participant inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with bavituximab and /or 
pembrolizumab, the participant will be immedi ately discontinued from study treatment. The site 
will contact the participant at least monthly and document the participant’s status until the 
pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to 
the Sponsor without  delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience 
(e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to 
the mother or newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to obtain per mission to 
follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the 
Sponsor. All pregnancies and exposure during breastfeeding, must be collected and reported 
from the time of treatment through 120 days  following cessatio n of study treatment, or 30 days  
following cessation of study treatment if the participant initiates new anticancer therapy  
Pregnancies must be reported within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge using the 
pregnancy form.  
Pregnancy in itself is not r egarded as an AE or SAE unless there is a suspicion that an 
investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study.  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 79 of 102 Confidential  
 All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abor tions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
8.6. Laboratory Abnormalities  
To the extent possible, all laboratory abnormalities observed during the course of the study will 
be included under a reported AE term describing a clinical syndrome (e.g., elevated BUN and 
creatinine in the setting of an AE of “renal failure”). In these c ases (e.g., an AE of renal failure), 
the laboratory abnormality itself (e.g., elevated creatinine) does not need to be recorded as an 
AE.  
If a laboratory abnormality cannot be reported as a clinical syndrome, AND if the laboratory 
abnormality results in a  therapeutic intervention (i.e., concomitant medication or therapy), is a 
DLT, or is judged by the Investigator to be of other particular clinical relevance, then the 
laboratory abnormality should be reported as an AE.  
Patients experiencing AEs or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be assessed and 
appropriate evaluations performed until all parameters have returned to baseline levels, or are 
consistent with the patient’s then -current physical condition.   
8.7. Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs, serious and nonserious, will be fully documented on the appropriate eCRF. For each 
AE, the Investigator must provide its duration (start and end dates or ongoing), intensity, 
assessment of causality and whether specific action or therapy was required.  
All AEs that occur from the signing of the ICF until the first dose of study treatment should be 
recorded on the AE eCRF page only if the event was related to a study procedure. All other 
AEs/findings prior to first dose of study treatment should be recorded as medical history on the 
applicable eCRF page. All AEs occurring from the first dose of study treatment until 30  days 
after the last dose of study treatment must be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
All AEs meeting serious criter ia, from the time of treatment/ allocation through 90 days following 
cessation of study treatment, or 30 days following cessation of study treatment if the participant 
initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier must be reported by the investiga tor.  
All SAEs and AESIs must be reported to the Sponsor’s designee within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge. This should be done by completing the eCRF SAE Report Form. 
Detailed instructions for reporting SAEs are provided in a study manual.  
Invest igators must follow patients with AEs/SAEs until the event has resolved, the condition has 
stabilized, withdrawal of consent, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, the patient is lost 
to follow up or death OR until the 30 -day Safety Follow -up Visit,  whichever occurs first. New 
and ongoing treatment -related SAEs should be followed beyond the 30 -day Safety Follow -up 
Visit. If the patient dies, this should be captured as the outcome of the AE unless no link between 
the AE and the patient death can be es tablished, in which case the AE will be marked as ongoing 
and the death will be reported as a separate event.  
If a patient is lost to follow up, this should be captured accordingly within the AE eCRF and on 
the follow up SAE report.  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol

Amendment 4 Page 80 of 102 Confidential  
 The Sponsor or designe e is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
applicable suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) as individual notifications 
or through periodic line listings. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to not ify the IRB 
or IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all 
unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical 
trial. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB  or IEC of these additional SAEs as required by 
their IEC/IRB.  
8.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are required to be reported by the Investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  8.7 for 
reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this st udy are as follows:  
An overdose of pembrolizumab as defined as any dose of 1000 mg or  ≥5 times the indicated 
dose, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event 
of overdose, the participant should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
An overdose of bavituximab is define as  any dose of 15mg/kg or ≥5 times the indicated dose.   
 No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of bavituximab . In the event of 
overdose, the subject should be  observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided  if clinically indicated.  
In the event of a known or suspected overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate 
hematology and clinical chemistry and should receive supportive therapy, as necessary. Please 
also refer to Section  6.3 for guidelines on the management of potential study treatment -related 
toxicities.  
 
An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal 
and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of 
normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper 
limit of normal, as determined by way of p rotocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.*  
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may 
require an addi tional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The trial site guidance for 
assessment and follow up of these criteria can be made available. It may also be 
appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in the setting of 
abnormaliti es of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline 
phosphatase that do not meet the criteria noted above. In these cases, the decision to 
proceed with additional evaluation will be made through consultation between the study 
investigators and the Sponsor Clinical Director. However, abnormalities of liver blood 
tests that do not meet the criteria noted above are not AESIs  for this trial.

Amendment 4 Page 81 of 102 Confidential  
 9. STATISTICS  
This trial will evaluate safety and efficacy of the bavituximab -pembrolizumab combination in a  
disease setting in which pembrolizumab has shown promising but modest activity. The 
hypothesis to be evaluated is whether the bavituximab -pembrolizumab combination will yield an 
ORR superior to historical ORR of pembrolizumab in the 2nd-line or 3rd-line setting s in patients 
who have not previously been exposed to an anti -PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 agent.  Detail on all 
planned statistical analyses will be presented in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   
The minimum efficacy analysis  will be conducted 3  months a fter 40  patients  have received at 
least one dose of  study  treatment .  There will be no more than 4 additional  patients enrolled 
during th e time the minimum efficacy analysis is taking place.   Conducting an analysis at 
approxima tely 40 patients  will limit patients risks if the combination is not trending towards an 
added benefit, as defined by a response rate of 15% or greater (6/40)  further exploration will be 
warranted before further  enrollment to 80 patients  (details provided  in interim analysis section) .  
9.1. Sample Size  
 
The primary efficacy objective of this Phase 2 study is the evaluation of ORR of bavituximab in 
combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ cancer. The sample 
size of 80 patients across both Group 1 and Group 2 was chosen to all ow minimal enrollment 
within each  of our four putative biomarker signatures to allow for exploration of differential 
responses , more information about the biomarkers can be found in section 7.5.1 . As noted above, 
an ORR of <15% will be regarded as futile as it will be unlikely to exceed the activity of 
pembrolizumab as a single agent in this study population.  
The following sample sizes apply:  
DLT Observation: up to 10 DLT -evaluable patients in total  
Phase 2: Minimum efficacy analysis: 40 total patients  across both Group 1 and Group 2 ; Full 
enrollment: 8 0 patients  
For the CPI -naïve patient population  assumptions , the historical ORR of pembrolizumab in the 
2nd-line setting  was approximately 15 % and an ORR of  the b avituximab -pembrolizumab 
combination was set to 30%. Approximately 40 patients are needed to show a statistical 
superiority  of bavituximab -pembrolizumab with 80% statistical power at one -sided type I error 
rate of α=0.10. In the 3rd-line setting  if the historical ORR is assumed as  6%, if the true ORR 
of Bavituximab -Pembrolizumab combination is 15%, then approximately 40 patients are needed 
to show a statistical superiority  of Bavituximab -Pembrolizumab with 74% statistical power at 
one-sided type I error rate of α=0.10. In addition, PDL1 status was able to impact outcome s in all 
lines of treatment with PDL1+ patients having better outcomes than negative.  By combining 
patients from DLT and the expansion phase , safety and efficacy information will be available for 
a total of 80 patients, assuming >6 responders are observed by 40.  Enrollment will not be 
controlled for the number of patients in each line nor PD -L1 status (2nd vs. 3rd line, positive vs. 
negative), these numbers could vary for each patient type ( e.g. 2nd line PDL1+ vs. Third line 
PDL1 negative). Tables 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 sho w  how  the power varies for with the 2nd and 3rd line 
cohorts with their respective sample sizes.

9.2. Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are defined for the study:  
Safety population : all patients who received at least 1 dose of bavituximab or pembrolizumab, 
regardless of their eligibility for the study. The safety evaluation will be performed based on the 
first dose a patient actually received. The safety population will be used for all analyses of 
dosing, exposure, and s afety.  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 83 of 102 Confidential  
 DLT -evaluable population : will include the first 3 patients up to a maximum of 10 patients who 
(1) receive at least 70% of the dose of bavituximab (2) complete the DLT observation period  or 
discontinue (from study treatment or from the study) durin g the DLT observation period (Cycle 
1) because of a DLT.  
PK population : will include all treated patients who received at least 1 full dose of bavituximab 
and pembrolizumab and have baseline and at least one postbaseline evaluable PK sample.  
Efficacy popul ation : will include all patients (including DLT patients) who receive any quantity 
of study treatment at the dose recommended for the Phase 2 population.  
9.3. Statistical Analyses  
Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of Oncologie, Inc. or its designee.  
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other  change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described 
in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and the clinical study report. Additional exploratory 
analyses of the data will be conduct ed as deemed appropriate.  
9.3.1.  Safety Analyses  
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of bavituximab or pembrolizumab will be evaluated for 
safety and toxicity. Data will be reviewed by group and dose level.   
Safety analyses will include summaries of the fo llowing:  
• DLTs: the number of patients who experienced any DLTs during the DLT observation 
period will be summarized by dose level  
• AEs, including severity and possible relationship to study treatment  
• AEs by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Sys tem Organ Class (SOC) by 
decreasing frequency of Preferred Term within SOC  
• Laboratory and nonlaboratory AEs by CTCAE v5.0 term, maximum CTCAE grade, and 
CTCAE Grade 3 and above (regardless of causality and at least possibly related to study 
treatment  
The final analysis will occur approximately 6 months after the last patient received his or her 
first dose of study treatment. Descriptive statistics will be derived where appropriate. Adverse 
events will be summarized by study arm; dose exposure and density f or each study drug will be 
calculated for each group and dose level.  
Incidence tables of patients with AEs will be presented for all AEs by maximum severity, SAEs, 
AEs assessed as related to study treatment, and AEs resulting in discontinuation of study 
treatment.  
Listings of all safety data sorted by dose , group , patient and assessment date will be provided.

 9.3.2.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Serum concentrations for bavituximab will be listed  and summarized using descriptive statistics 
by cohort  and group  at each time point.  
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be listed  and summarized using descriptive statistics by 
cohort and  group  at each time point .  
The PK/PD relationship and relationship to tumor response may be explored.  
9.3.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
In order to characterize the preliminary efficacy signal, the primary efficacy endpoint will be the 
best overall response rate (CR and PR) according to RECIST Ve rsion 1.1 ( Appendix A ) as 
determined by the Investigator. Corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) will also be provided.  
For planning purposes, ORR of <1 5% will be regarded as futile as the combination will be 
unlikely to exceed t he activity of pembrolizumab as a single agent.  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the full analysis set, and per protocol analysis set, 
including predefined biomarker subgroups ( Section  9.3.2 ). 
Duration of Response (D oR), defined as the interval from the date measurement criteria are met 
for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the earliest date of disease progression, as 
determined by Investigator assessment of objective radiographic disease assessments per 
RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause if occurring sooner than progression. Only subjects who 
achieve an initial response will be evaluated for DOR.  
Stable disease (SD) at 6 weeks wil l also be used to derive the clinical benefit rate (CBR), 
consisting of ORR and SD.  
Progression -Free Survival (PFS) will be defined as the interval from the date of first dose of 
investigational agent until the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by Investigator 
assessment of objective radiographic disease assessments per RECIST version1.1 or death due to 
any cause if occurring sooner than progression.  
Overall survival (OS) defined as the interval from the date of first dose of investigational agent 
until the date of death.  
Presentations of efficacy will include patients e nrolled in Part 1 as well as patients treated at the 
recommended dose. Individual changes in tumor burden over time will be presented graphically 
(for example, Waterfall plots). Details regarding statistical methodologies associated with 
analyses of the in itial efficacy signal will be further defined in the SAP.  
9.3.4.  Primary Analysis  
The primary analysis will be conducted approximately 6 months after the last patient receives his 
or her first dose of study treatment

 9.3.5.  Other Analyses  
9.3.5.1.  Patient Characteristics  
Patient characteristics will be summarized:  
Patient demographics will be reported using descriptive statistics. Demographic data are  
collected and reported to demonstrate that a trial population represents the target patient 
population considered for regulatory approval.  
Baseline disease characteristics will be summarized by presenting frequency counts and 
percentages (for example, fo r pathological diagnosis [histological or cytological] and disease 
stage).  
A detailed description of patient disposition will be provided. It will include a summary of the 
number and percentage of patients entered into the study, enrolled in the study, an d treated, as 
well as the number and percentage of patients discontinuing (overall and by reason for 
discontinuation).  
Disease -related therapies, including prior anticancer treatments and prior radiotherapies (such as 
type of therapy, regimen, and prior s urgery)  
A summary of prior and concomitant medications by study arm will be reported. Other patient 
characteristics will be summarized as deemed appropriate.  
9.3.5.2.  Poststudy -Treatment -Discontinuation Therapy  
The numbers and percentages of patients reporting po ststudy -treatment -discontinuation 
anticancer therapies will be provided by type of therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic 
therapy) and by drug class and/or name, overall and by line of therapy.  
9.3.5.3.  Treatment Compliance  
The number of dose omissions, redu ctions, and delays, number of cycles received, and dose 
intensity will be summarized for all treated patient s.  
9.3.5.4.  Interim Analysis  
Safety data will be reviewed during the study. The purpose of these data reviews is to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability fo r the initial dose schedule and determine if a DLT has been 
observed. Additional safety analyses will be performed when a total of 10 subject  patients have 
received at least one dose of study therapy and followed for 3 months after the 10th patients 
receiv es the first dose of study therapy. At that point the available clinical safety data as well as 
laboratory data will be evaluated particularly for late -onset DLT -like toxicities.  
Interim analyses of the safety and efficacy data will be performed approxima tely 3 months after 
a total 40 patients  across both Group 1 and Group 2  have received at least one dose of study 
treatment. The data from the interim analyses will be considered directional and used primarily 
for minimal efficacy analysis considerations.  After the analysis of 40 patient s for ORR, the 
activity of study therapy across the entire population as well as in the combined pool of 
biomarker groups will be analyzed , and , if the data appear to be promising , the study population 
or the overall sample size may be adjusted via an amendment.

 The study  will be assessed for futility if the interim analysis finds no evidence for the activity of 
the study therapy beyond that expected for pembro lizumab monotherapy.   No formal statistical 
testing will be done at the interim analysis. Details on the procedures for the interim analysis will 
be provided in the SAP.  
9.4. Statistical Methods  
Tabular summaries of data will be descriptive in nature (i.e., number of patients [n], mean, 
standard deviation, median, minim um and maximum for continuous variables and n and percent 
for categorical variables). A more detailed description of analysis methods will be provided in 
the SAP to be completed prior to the clinical database lock.

details of the study and to discuss and decide on their participation in the study with the 
Investigator concerned. The patient and the person explaining about the study and with whom 
they discuss the informed consent will sign and date the ICF. A copy of the signed ICF will be 
retained by the patient and the original will be filed in the Investigator file unless otherwise 
agreed.  
10.4. Study Monitoring  
On behalf of the Sponsor, a clinical research organization monitor will contact and visit the 
Investigator at the study center before the entry of the first patient and at predetermined 
appropriate intervals during the study until after the last patient ha s completed. The monitor will 
also perform a study closure visit.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the Investigator must ensure provision of sufficient 
time, reasonable space, and adequate qualified personnel for the monitoring visits. The visits ar e

 for the purpose of verifying adherence to the study protocol and the completeness, consistency, 
and accuracy of data entered on the eCRF and other documents.  
The Investigator will make all source data (i.e., the various study records, the eCRFs, laborato ry 
test reports, other  records, drug accountability forms, and other pertinent data) available for the 
monitor and allow access to them throughout the entire study period. Monitoring is done by 
comparing the relevant site records of the patients with the entries on the eCRF (i.e., source data 
verification). It is the monitor’s responsibility to verify the adherence to the study protocol and 
the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data recorded on the eCRFs.  
By agreeing to participate in the stud y, the Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to 
ensure that any problems detected in the course of the monitoring visits are resolved. Contact 
information for the study monitor is located in the Investigator file. Representatives from the 
Spons or may also contact and visit the Investigators and monitor data during the study.  
10.5. Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  
The data will be collected using an electronic data capture (EDC) system. Sites will receive 
training on the EDC system. All users will be  supplied with unique login credentials.  
Before study start, the Investigator will prepare a list showing the signature and handwritten 
initials of all individuals authorized to make or change entries on eCRFs. This “study center 
personnel and delegation l ist” must be kept current throughout the study.  
For each patient enrolled, an eCRF must be completed, reviewed, signed, and dated by the 
Principal Investigator or Co -Investigator within a reasonable time period (< 2 weeks) after data 
collection. This also applies to records for those patients who fail to complete the study. If a 
patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a patient is 
withdrawn from the study because of a treatment -limiting AE, thorough efforts should be made 
to clearly document the outcome.  
Full information regarding EDC and completing eCRFs is included in a study manual. All 
questions or comments related to electronic capture should be directed to the assigned monitor.  
10.6. Study Termination and Site Closure  
Both the Sponsor and the Investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. Should 
this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures. In terminating the study, 
the Sponsor and the Investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection 
of the patients’ interests.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for medical or administrative 
reasons. When feasible, a 30 -day written notification will be given.  
The entire study will be stopped if:  
The protocol -specified treatment is considered too toxic to continue the study;  
Evidence has emerged that, in the opinion of the Sponsor or the Investigator(s), makes the 
continuation of the study unnecessary or unethical;  
The sta ted objectives of the study are achieved;  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 90 of 102 Confidential  
 The Sponsor discontinues the development of study treatment.  
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuation of follow up must be recorded on the eCRF. Al l reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented. In terminating the study, the Investigator will ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests.  
10.7. Modification of the Study Protocol  
Protocol amendments,  except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients, must 
be made only with the prior approval of the Sponsor. Agreement from the Investigator must be 
obtained for all protocol amendments and amendments to the informed consent document. The  
IEC/IRB must be informed of all amendments and give approval before their implementation. 
The Sponsor will submit any study protocol amendments to the concerned regulatory authorities 
for approval and keep the Investigator(s) updated as detailed in the IC H GCP guidelines.  
10.8. Retention of Study Documents  
The study site will maintain a study file, which should contain, at minimum, the IB, the protocol 
and any amendments, drug accountability records, correspondence with the IRB and the 
Sponsor, and other study -related documents.  
The Investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not limited to) 
the identification of all participating patients, medical records, study -specific source documents, 
source worksheets, all original signed a nd dated ICFs, copies of all eCRFs, query responses, and 
detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities 
and the Sponsor or its designees.  
The Investigator shall retain records required to be maintained for a period of 5  years after the 
date a marketing application in an ICH region is approved for the drug for the indication for 
which it is being investigated or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not 
approved for such indication, until  at least 5 years after the investigation is discontinued. 
However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s) or if needed by the Sponsor. In addition, the Investigator must make 
provisio n for the patients’ medical records to be kept for the same period of time.  
No data should be destroyed without the agreement of the Sponsor. Should the Investigator wish 
to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the Sp onsor must 
be notified in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location. The Sponsor will 
inform the Investigator, in writing, when the study -related records are no longer needed.  
Patients’ medical records and other original data will be ar chived in accordance with the 
archiving regulations or facilities of the investigational site.  
10.9. Clinical Study Report  
A clinical study report will be prepared under the responsibility and supervision of the Sponsor 
and signed by a Sponsor representative, th ereby indicating their agreement with the analyses, 
results, and conclusions of the clinical study report.

 10.10.  Study Publication  
The conditions regulating dissemination of the information derived from this study are described 
in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
10.11.  Quality Assurance Audits  
Clinical centers may be audited by the Sponsor’s Quality Unit (QU) qualified auditor or designee 
as required per approved schedule. The purpose of an audit, which is independent of and separate 
from routine monitoring or Quality Uni t (QU) functions, is to evaluate study conduct and 
compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, ICH GCPs, and the applicable 
regulatory requirements. The Investigator and the Sponsor may also be subject to an inspection 
by FDA, European reg ulatory authorities, or other applicable regulatory authorities at any time.  
The auditor and regulatory authorities will require authority from the Investigator to have direct 
access to the patients’ medical records. It is important that the Investigator(s ) and their staff 
cooperate with the auditor or regulatory authorities during this audit or inspection.

 12 APPENDICES  
Appendix A: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version  1.1 
The RECIST guidelines (version 1.1) are described in Eisenhauer (2009) and at 
http://www.eortc.be/Recist/Default.htm. A short summary is given below.  
Measurable Disease:  
Tumor lesions: measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately meas ured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with the following:  
• A minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan thickness no greater than 5 mm);  
• A minimum size of 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable);  
• A minimum size of 20 mm by chest X -ray. 
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes: to be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be not greater than 5 mm). At bas eline and in follow up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Nonmeasurable Disease:  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as we ll as truly nonmeasurable 
lesions, are considered nonmeasurable disease. Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin and lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
Bone Lesions  
Bone lesions, cystic lesion, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment. Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can 
be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can 
be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as 
measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability de scribed 
above.  
Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable.  
Oncologie, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 96 of 102 Confidential  
 Cystic Lesions  
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered 
as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) because they are, by definit ion, 
simple cysts.  
Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferre d as target lesions.  
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment  
Tumor lesions situated in a previous irradiated area or in an area subjected to other locoregional 
therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in 
the lesion.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be select ed on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and report ed as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference 
by which to characterize the overall tumor response.  
Non-target Lesions  
RECIST criteria require unequivocal quantification of the changes in tumor size for adequate 
interpretation of the sum of target lesions. Consequently, when the boundaries of the primary are 
difficult to delineate, this tumor should not be considered a target lesion.  
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
The same method of assessment and the same techniqu e should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used to assess the 
antitumor effect of a treatmen t.

Bavituximab  and Pembrolizumab  Study ONCG100  
Amendment 4 Page 97 of 102 Confidential  
 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <  10 
mm. 
Partial Response  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD.  
Stable Disease  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD 
since the treatment started.  
Progressive Disease  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, 
the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.  
  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  
Stable Disease/Incomplete 
Response  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression 
of existing non -target lesions.  
  
If tumor markers are initially above the institutional ULN, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered a complete responder.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
Time Point Response  
A response assessment will occur at the protocol -specified time points. The tables below provide 
a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable and non -measurable disease (non -target disease only).

a If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria 
relative to baseline, makes this disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response 
would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was me t. However sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when 
subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time 
point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best r esponse is PR.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration”. This is a 
reason for stopping therapy, but is NOT objective PD. Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is al so considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing 
argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change 
the assigned time point response, which is most likely to occur in the case of PD; e.g., if only 2 
of 3 baseline target lesions are assessed and result in a > 20% increase in the sum, then the 
patient would be assessed as a PD regardless of the missing lesion.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
witho ut objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
symptomatic deterioration. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, 
even after discontinuation of treatment.  
In some circumstances, it may be  difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated (fine needle aspiration/biopsy) before confirming the CR status.  
Confirmatory  Measurement/Duration of Response  
Confirmation  
Radiographic tumor assessments are required. If an initial CR or PR is noted, confirmatory scans 
must be performed at least 4  weeks later. In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have 
met the SD criteri a at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of no less than 4 weeks.

Amendment 4 Page 100 of 102 Confidential  
 Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR 
or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first  date that recurrent or PD is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first  date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

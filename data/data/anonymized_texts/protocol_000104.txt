Study Title
A Phase 3b, multicenter, open -label study  to evaluate the immune response to,and the safet y of,
vaccines in participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosi s who receive oral ozanimo d 
compared to non -pegylate d interferon (IFN)-βor no disease modifying therapy .
Indication
Relapsing forms of mult iple sclerosis
Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerat ive disease of the central 
nervous system  (CNS) characterized by inflammat ion, demyelinat ion, neuronal and 
oligodendrocy te loss, and disrupt ion of the blood -brain barrier, leading to irreversible defici ts in 
physical funct ion and cognit ion and an impaired qualit y of life(Lassmann, 2019). T he prevalence 
of MS is increasing and is current ly estimated to affect 2.3 millio n individuals worldwide (Multiple 
Sclerosis International Foundat ion, 2013 ).
Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, whi ch binds with high affinit y 
select ively to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 (S1P1 and S1P5). Ozanimod 
causes lymphocy te retention in lympho id tissues. The mechanism by which ozanim od exerts 
therapeuti c effects in MS is unknown but may involve reduct ion of lymphocyte migrat ion into the 
CNS (Scott, 2016; Chaudry, 2017). Ozanimod is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of 
multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults in the United States (US)and for the treatment of adult subjects 
withrelapsing- remitt ing MS (RRMS )with active d isease as defined by clinical or imaging features 
in European Medicines Agency  (EMA) j urisdict ions.
Based on itsmechanism of action ozanimod has the potenti al to reduce the immune response to
vaccinations ; however, the effect of ozanimod on vaccination response has not been measured. 
Because many subjects with MS receive disease modifying therapi es(DMT) chronically and 
receive vaccinat ions while being treated with DMT s, the effect of ozanimod on the vaccinat ion 
response of MS subjects is of interest to patients and prescribers. This study  will evaluate the 
immune response to vaccines in subjects wi th RMS taking ozanim od com paredtoRMS subjects 
not taking ozanimod . 
The vaccines chosen to inve stigate in this study  allow f or the assessment of the hum oral immune 
response and are of clinical relevance to MS populations. 
Objectives
Primary Objective
To evaluate the proporti on of subjects meet ing serol ogic response criteria against the tetanus 
toxoi d antigen after vaccinat ion with the Tetanus Toxoi d, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoi d and 
Acellular Pertussi s, Adsorbed (Tdap) vaccine in subjects with RMS receiving ozanim od or
receiving non-pegylated interferon -β (IFN-β)or no DMT .

To evaluate the following in subjects wi th RMS undergoing vaccinat ion and receiving ozanim od 
or receiving non -pegylated IFN -or no DMT:
Proporti on of  subjects m eeting tetanus seroprotective criteria
Proporti on of subjects m eeting pneumococcus serologic respo nseand seroprotecti vecriteria
Safety and tol erabilit y
Exploratory Objectives
To eval uate the following in subjects wi th RMS undergoing vaccinat ion and receiving ozanim od 
or receiving non -pegylated IFN -or no DMT:
Immune response to the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine
Proporti on of subjects meet ing diphtheria serol ogic response, seroprotecti vecriteria,and the
Geom etric Mean Concentrati on (GMC)ratio of anti-diphtheria immunogl obulin G ( IgG)and
immunogl obulin M (IgM)
Proporti on of subjec ts meet ing pertussi s serol ogic response, seroprotecti vecriteria,and the
GMC ratio of anti-pertussi s IgG and IgM
GMCratios of  IgG and IgM against tetanus antigens
GMC ratios of IgG and IgM against antigens contained inthepneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccine (PPSV23 )
Pharmacokinet ic (PK)andpharmacodynamic (PD)parameters of ozanimod and its active
metabo lites (ie,CC112273 )in subjects who receive ozanimod as their standard of care
Study Design
The proposed study  is a Phase 3 b, mul ticenter, open -label study to eval uate the immune response 
to and the safet y of vaccines administered in subjects with RMS who receive either oral ozanimod 
0.92 m gorIFN-β or no DMT .
All enro lled subjects will be vaccinated on Day 1 and fo llowed until Day 28 ( ±3 day s) to eva luate 
immune response via sero logical endpo ints. 
The study  will include two cohorts different iated by the vaccines administered. Cohort 1 comprises
subjects who receiv eTdap , PPSV23, and the seasonal inact ivated influenza vaccine. Cohort 2 
comprises subjects who have already received the seasonal inact ivated influenza vaccine and will
therefore receive Tdap and PPSV23 only. Initiation of Cohort 2 will bebased on the availabili ty 
of eligible subjects who have not previously been vaccinated with the seasonal  inactivated 
influenza vaccine . Cohort 2 may be opened for enrollment at any  time determined by the Sponsor
butis estimated to occur after no less than 60% of subjects of the planned total enrollment have 
been recruited into Cohort 1 . Subjects who meet all eligibilit y criteria will cont inue to be enro lled 
in Cohort 1 throughout the time both cohorts are open for enrollment at the discretion of the 
Sponsor .
The study will be conducted in co mpliance with Internat ional Conference on Harmonisat ion (IC H) 
Good Clinical Pract ices (GCPs) .

Overview of Key Safety Assessments
Safety assess ment sin the study  include adverse events (AE), vital signs, physical examinat ion, 
clinical laboratory  evaluat ions, and relapses.The incidence, severit y, relationship, and type of 
treatm ent-emergent AEs,serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading tostudy discont inuat ion, 
and relapses will be summarized, as well as clinically meaningful changes from baseline for 
clinical laboratory  measures, vital signs, and physical examinat ions. 
Statistical Methods
This is a non-rando mized, open -label study  in which all subjects remain on their pre-study 
(baseline) treatm ent per protocol. Subjects will be recrui ted by invest igators from MS clinical 
practi ce patients and prospectively assessed for immune response to vaccinat ion.The statistical 
analyses will focus on estimat ing immune response rates, adjust ing for baseline subject -level 
characterist ics.No formal statist ical hypothesis is evaluated . To mit igate for potential differences 
in the recrui ted subject popul ation in the ozanimod and non -ozanim od arm sthatpotentially could 
affect immune response ,response rates will be estimated based on a logistic regressio n model 
adjusting forseveral factors, eg,age, sex, body mass index (BMI ), and baseline absolute
lymphocy te coun t(ALC) . The resul ts of the statistical analyses for immune response endpo ints 
will be summarized for subjects receiving ozanimod (ozanimod arm) and subjects not receiving

summarized by  descriptive stati stics separately for the ozanimod and non -ozanim od arm s.
The primary  endpo int is the proporti on of subjects with serol ogic response to vaccination with 
tetanus toxoid. The primary endpo int analysis and all analyses for immune response to vaccinat ion 
will be performed in theper-protocol popul ation, ie,in subjects who received the correctly 
assigned vaccinations , had nosystemic useof corticosteroi ds, and did not receive any other 
vaccines throughout the study . Sensi tivity analyses will  be conducted wi thin the modified intent-
to-treat population consist ing of all subjects who received at least one vaccinat ion and summarized 
according to their init ial armstatus (ozanimod vs. non -ozanim od) regardless of steroi d use . 
The sample size of the study is 60 subjects with an estimated 30 subjects expected to have received 
ozanimod and 30 subjects expected to not have received ozanim od as standard of care DMT . It is 
expected that approximately 60% of the subjects in the IFN-β or no DMT control group will have 
a serol ogic response to vaccinat ion with Tdap (Kappos, 2015).

1.1 MS Disease Background 
Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosi s (MS) is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory  demyelinat ing disease of the 
Central  Nervous System  (CNS ). The disease is characterized patho logically  by inflammatory 
lesions of CNS myelin with resultant edem a, demyelinat ion, andoligodendrocy te and neuronal 
loss. Acute inflammatory lesio ns are initiated by activated peripheral lymphocy tes that enter the 
CNS through a breached blood -brain barrier (Lucchenetti, 2000; Popescu, 2012; Lassmann 2007,
Lassman, 2019; Frisher, 2015 )
The prevalence of MS is increasing and is currently  estimated to affect 2.3 millio n individuals 
worldwide (Multiple Sclerosis Internat ional Foundat ion, 2013 ). In Europe (EU) , the highest  
prevalence of MS occurs in countri es with high latitude, including Sweden (188.9 per 100,000), 
Norway  (203 per 100,000), and Denmark (232 per 100,00 0) (Ahlgren, 2011; Grytten, 2015; Koch -
Henriksen, 2015 ). Estimates that 300,000 to 400,000 individuals have MS in the United States
(US) are based largely on revisio nsof estimates from  older data (Baum, 1981; Anderson, 1992; 
Evans, 2013 ).  In an algorithm applied to private, military, and public Administrative Health 
Claims datasets, t he estimated 2010 prevalence of MS in the US was 727,344 cases and may have 
been as high as 913,925 in 2017 (Wallin, 2019 ).The median age at onset is approximately 30 years 
of age and there is a consistent, 3:1 female to male ratio ( McKay, 2015; Ribbo ns, 2015 ).
Relapsing MS(RMS) has an initial presentati on of an acute attack which accounts for the initial 
presentation ofapproximately 85% of all subjects withMS (Confavreux, 2003; Reich , 2018 ). 
Typical  symptom s include numbness and weakness in the legs leadi ng to difficult y walking, visio n 
loss, incoordination, cogni tive dysfunct ion, fatigue,and pain. Almost half of relapses may resul t 
in incomplete recovery  of function and leave permanent disabilit y and impairment that 
accumulates over time ( Lublin, 2003). 
There are several Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs )available for the treatm ent of MS with 
different mechanisms ofaction and differentiated efficacy  and safet y profiles. These include (1) 
the first-approved DMT s (interferon [IFN] β-1a, IFN β-1b, glatiramer acetate [GA]), (2) oral 
therapi es (fingo limod, siponim od, ozanimod, dimethyl fumarate, terifluno mide, and cladribine), 
and (3) monoclonal ant ibodies (alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatum umab, andnatalizumab ).
1.2 Com pound Background 
Ozanimod 
Ozanimod is approved for the treatment of RMS in adults in the US and for the treatm ent of adult 
subjects with relapsing -remitt ing multip le sclerosis (RRMS )with active disease as defined by 
clinical or imaging features in European Medicines Agency ( EMA )jurisdict ions.
Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1- phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, which binds with high affinit y 
select ively to sphingosine 1 -phosphate receptor subt ypes 1 and 5 (S1P1 and S1P5). This leads to 
reversible sequest ration of  lymphocy tes in lymphoid tissues. The mechanism by which ozanimod

migration into the CNS (Scott, 2016; Chaudry, 2017) . 
Ozanimod was evaluated in two large, rando mized, double -blind, double -dummy , parallel -group, 
active controlled clinical trials o f similar design and endpo ints, in subjects with RMS. SUNBEAM 
was a 1-year study  with subjects continuing assigned treatm ent beyo nd month 12 until the last 
enrolled subject completed the study  (Comi, 2019 ). RADIANCE was a 2-year study (Cohen, 
2019 ).The active comparator was IFN β-1a 30 µg intramuscularly (IM) once a week in both 
studi es.The primary endpo int, annualized relapse rate (ARR) ,was met for ozanimod 1 mg versus 
IFN-β-1a in each study . In Study  RPC01 -301, a statist ically significant ly(p < 0.0001) lower 
adjusted ARR was observed for ozanimod 1 mg(0.181; [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.140, 
0.236]) compared with IFN-β-1a (0.350 ; [95% CI:0.279 , 0.440 ]), corresponding to a 48.2% 
reducti on in ARR over 12+ months. In Study  RPC01 -201B, a statistically significant ly (p < 
0.0001) lower adjusted ARR was observed for the ozanim od 1 mg group (0.172; [95 % CI :0.142, 
0.208]) compared with the IFN-β-1a group (0.276; [95% CI:0.234, 0.324] ), corresponding to a 
37.7% reduction in ARR over 24 months . Keysecondary endpo ints of new or enlarging T2 lesio ns 
and the number of gadolinium -enhancing (GdE) lesions were met for ozanimod 1mg versus IFN
β-1a. 
The safet y profile of ozanimod iswell-characterized bya phase 2 and two large phase 3 studi es
and their ongoing open label exten sion and isconsistent with the known safet y profile of S1P 
modulators (Novartis Pharmaceut icals Corporati on, 2010; 2019 ). Treatment initiation with S1P 
receptor modulators  resultsin a transient, dose-dependent brady arrhy thmia in both healthy 
subjects and in subjects with RMS mediated through the S1P1 receptor in hu mans (Gergely, 2009; 
Horga, 2010 ; Juif, 2016; Scott, 2016 ). Ozanimod treatm ent requi res a dose escalati on regimen at 
treatment initiation, to minimize transient reduction in heart rate (Celgene Corporation, 2020).
IFN-β 
Interferons are naturally  occurring proteins produced by eukary otic cells in response to viral 
infect ion and other agents. The type I family of int erferons includes the IFN -βs, which are used to
treat MS; however, the mechanism of action of IFN-β in the treatm ent of MS isnotcompletely 
understood .
After the Interferon Beta Study Group demonstrated IFNβ-1b efficacy ( INFB SG, 1993 ), the drug 
was approved for the treatment of RMS in the USalmo st 30years ago andis approved for the 
treatm ent of RRMS in EMA jurisdictions . Forms of IFN-βfor the treatment of MS include IFNβ-
1a (administered IM once per week or subcutaneously [SC] 3 times per week) and IFN β-1b 
(administered SC every other day ).
Tdap
In this study BOOSTRIX®, a booster vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid 
and acellular pertussi s antigens(Tdap) ,that confer protection against tetanus, diphtheri a, and 
pertussi s diseases ,will be administered. The acellular pertussi s vaccine adsorbed component of 
the Tdap vaccine contains 5 bacteri al antigens: pertussis toxoi d and 4 adhesi on proteins of 
filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin and fimbriae ty pes 2 and 3 ( Dewan, 2020 ).

Date 29NOV 2022 19TheCenters for Disease Control (CDC) in the US recommends receiving the Tdap vaccine ever y 
10 yearsfor adults , ormore frequent lyif clinically  indicated . The Tdap vaccine can be safet y 
administered at the same time as other vaccines. Addi tional informat ion about the tetanus vaccine 
can be found at https:// www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap -tdap-td/hcp/index.html .  The World 
Health Organizat ion (WHO) currently recommends primary vaccinat ion against tetanus during 
childhood administering 3-4 doses of the tetanus vaccine in the first 2 years of life, followed by 
booster vaccinat ions throughout adulthood every 10 -20 years ( Weinberger, 2017). MostEuropean 
countri es followthe WHO recommendat ions.For example, in Germany , the Tdap vaccine is 
recommended every 10 years in adults and should be administered as a vaccine that also vaccinates 
against diphtheria and pertussis ( https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2019/
Ausgaben/34_19.pdf?__blo b=publicat ionFile ). 
PPSV23
In this study  the PNEUMOVAX23®vaccine will be used. PNEUMOVAX23®is a sterile, liquid 
vaccine consist ing of a  m ixture of purified capsular polysaccharides from Streptococcus 
pneumo niae t ypes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 
20, 22F, 23F, and 33F) (Merck & Co., Inc, 1983 ).  Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PPSV23) contains antigens to 23 pneumoc occal  seroty pes provi ding protecti on against 80-90% 
of capsular seroty pes causing disease (Daniels, 2016).  The CDC recommends routine PPSV23 in 
all adults 65 years and older and in adults 19 through 64 years of age with certain medical 
condi tions. (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneum o/hcp/index.html.)   In Germany, PPSV23 
vaccine is recommended in adults ≥ 60 years of age and in adul ts wi th chronic diseases including 
neuro logical diseases (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2019/ Ausgaben/

recommandat ions/34_2017_engl.pdf?__blo b=publicat ionFile ). Addit ionally, routine booster 
vaccination for the PPSV23 vaccine can be considered in immunoco mpromised and at-risk 
subjects with repeat vaccinat ions of intervals o f at least 6 years in Germany and 5 years in the US 
after the l ast vaccinat ion for subjects with increased risk for pneumococcal disease. 
Seasonal influenza vaccine
In thi s study  a seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine will be administered .
The CDC recommends that peopl e 6 months and older shoul d receive a licensed age -appropriate 
influenza vaccine each year at the start of the influenza season. Vaccinat ion is particularly 
important in subjects who are at high risk of developing influenza complicati ons. These subjects 
include thosewith neuro logic condit ions and subjects requiring chronic medicat ions that suppress 
the immune system . The CDC recommends that the influenza vaccine is administered by end of 
October in the US; h owever, getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial and vaccinat ion should 
continue to be offered throughout the influenza season (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/v
pd/flu/hcp/index.ht ml.)
In Europe , the seasonal  influenza vaccine is recommended in all individuals older than 6 months 
of age with certain chronic diseases. Administratio nof a tetravalent vaccine is recommended 
before the influenza season begins (World Heal th Organizat ion, 2021 ).

Date 29NOV 2022 201.3 Rationale
1.3.1 Purpose of Study
Based on its mechanism of action,ozanimod has the potential  to reduce the immune response to 
vaccinations. However, the effect of ozanimod on vaccination response has not been assessed . This 
study is designed to provide data on the immune response and safet y of administering vaccines to 
RMS subjects taking ozanim od compared to controls taking IFN-βsor receiving no DMT. The 
data of  this study  will support the labelsfor ozanimod in MS because the effect of  ozanim od on 
the vaccinat ion response o f MS subjects is of interest to patients and prescribers .
In this study , we do not anti cipate the ri sks of  receiving vaccines to be different than the risk sof 
receiving vaccines in the general population. Several  clinical studi es have been conducted using 
multiple vaccines in MS subjects, providing no evidence that receiving multip le vaccinat ions is 
unsafe for MS subjects (Ufer, 2017; Bar -Or, 2020 ; Ciotti, 2020 )
1.3.2 Ratio nale to Study Vaccine Response in Ozanimod Subjects
Persons with MS shoul d receive vaccinations to avoid preventable diseases (Reyes ,2020; Riva ,
2021). In persons with MS not receiving immunotherapy , the disease itself does not appear to 
affect the abilit y of individuals to mount an immune response to antigenic stimulat ion,and the 
vaccine response is similar to those who do not have MS ( Moriabadi , 2001 ). Infect ions may trigger 
MS relapses, increase MS radio logic and immuno logic act ivity, and accelerate disease progression 
(Pannitch, 1994; Buljevac ,2002; Correale ,2006; Farez, 2019). Multiple sclerosi s subjects
receiving immunotherapies as part of MS treatment may be at an increased risk of infect ion,
including pneumococcal pneum onia and influenza infect ion, which carry the potenti al to cause 
significant morbidity and mortalit y in individuals with chronic debilitat ing diseases (De Keyser, 
1998 ; Noseworthy , 2000 ).The vaccines administered in this study  have not been associated wi th 
an increased risk of developing MS ,with an increased ri sk of relapse ,or wi th an increased ri sk of 
MS disease activit y in MS subjects; however, MS subjects are not recommended to receive 
vaccines during a relapse (Confavreux, 2001; Farez, 2019; DeStefano, 2003; Loebermann , 201 3). 
The availabili ty of vaccine immune response and safet y data insubjects treated with ozanim od 
will help guide practit ioners onthe impact of ozanimod on vaccine responses in MS subjects .
1.3.3 Effects of DMTs on Vaccine Response
Several studies have evaluated the impact of D MTs on vaccine response , incl uding studi esoftwo 
other S1P modulators , fingo limod and siponimod. Multiple sclerosi ssubjects and healthy 
volunteers treated with fingo limod showed significant ly lower response rates to influenza , 
PPSV23, and tetanus toxoid vaccines at mult iple timepo ints post-vaccination compared to placebo
(Boul ton, 2012; Kappos, 2015 ).Healthy volunteers treated with siponim od met seroprotective 
criteria similar to those in other treatm ent groups toinfluenz a after vaccination, buttiter ratios 
were generally  lower in siponim odgroup s (Ufer, 2017 ).
Non-pegylated IFN-βs in MS subjects produce immune responses comparable to control s and do
not reduce response to vaccinat ion (Schwid , 2005 ; Olberg 2014 ;Bar-Or, 2013; von Hehn, 2017 ).
A few studi es suggest a trend of potential increased humoral immune response in MS subjects

not consistent across studies, andIFN-β has not proven to be a vaccine adjuvant (Toporovski , 
2010; Rizza, 2011; Ye, 2019 ).Pegylated IFN-β has not been studied for effect on vaccine response
in MS subjects .
Ocrelizumab demonstrated asignificant ly reduce dimmune response to several vaccines with 
some subjects not achieving seroprotection (Bar-Or, 2020 ). Both dimethyl fumarate and 
terifluno mide showed no si gnificant differences in response rates; similarly , natalizumab -treated 
subjects showed no significant differences in ant igen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)response, 
but generally had lower titers, leading to an inadequate response in so me su bjects ( von Hehn, 
2017; Bar -Or, 2013; Kaufman, 2014). Glatiramer acetate vaccine studies show mixed results on 
immune response (Olberg 2014 ; Olberg, 2018 ).
1.3.4 Rationale for Selected Study Design
This study  will use a prospective, open -label design with subjects receiving vaccine sata single 
visit fo llowed by immune response and safet y assessment s28 days later in subjects on steady state
ozanimod compared to subjects receiving IFN-β as a reference control or not receiving DMT 
treatm ent. Using a control group ofsubjects treated with IFN-βis supported by vaccinat ion studi es 
in MS subjects on IFN -βswhich show similar post-vaccinat ion immune responses to MS subjects
receiving no DMT (Olberg , 2014 ; Olberg, 2018; Mehling, 2013 )and subjects on IFN -βs have been 
successfully used as control s in other MS DMT vaccine response studi es (Bar-Or, 2013 ; Olberg ,
2020; Von Hehn, 2018 ).  Mult iple vaccines administered during a single visit are well established 
in children and recommended for adults as safe, tolerable, andare not likely to reduce immune 
response ( King, 1994 ; Broderi ck, 2016 ; Ferlito, 202 1). Open -label designs areacceptable to assess 
the effects of immune modulat ing therapies on vaccine response and by vaccine m anufacturers to 
assess vaccine immunogenicit y (Schwid, 2005; Bar-Or, 2013; Olberg, 2018; Von Hehn, 2018 ). 
Laboratory  studies, including the immuno logical correl ates that assess the humoral response to 
vaccines (eg,serum  antibody  concentrati ons or antibody  titers) provide object iveassessment sof 
vaccine response assubst itute endpoints for longer term studies that measure clinical protective 
effect (Madore, 2010 ). Thespecific laboratory  criteria used to establish vaccine immunogenicit y 
is vaccine dependent .  In general, vaccine responses are assessed bycompar ing post-vaccinatio n
to pre-vaccinat ion antibody  levels and by determining whether responses surpass a minimu m 
thresho ld for seroprotection oran increase in ant ibody  titers/concentrations to produce a serol ogic 
response (WHO, 2013 ). The laboratory  criteria used in this study  arebased onguideline 
recommendat ions and correlates of humoral immunit y (EMA, 1997; Qin, 2007; FDA, 2007; 
Plotkin, 2008 ). To mitigate thedifferences in the recruited subject populat ion, this study  will define 
eligibilit y criteria to reduce potential confounding variables affect ing immune response to
vaccination. Despite well-defined eligibilit y criteria, to account forpotential confounders that
couldaffect immune response s,serol ogical response criteria will be compared based on a model 
adjusting for appropriate factors (eg,age, sex, body  mass index [BMI ], and baseline absol ute 
lymphocy te count [ ALC ]).

Date 29NOV 2022 22To mi tigate the risk of potenti al enrollment challenges surrounding influenza season, the study  is 
designed to allow the addition of a second cohort of  subjects that may have already received the 
seasonal influenza vaccine. Subjects in Cohort 2 will only receive Tdap and PPSV23. As of 13 
May 2022, Cohort 1 i s closed, and study  subjects are only able to enroll in Cohort 2. 
Some subjects in either treatment arm may have discontinued S1P modulators due to lymphopenia
and may have ongoing profound lymphopenia thatcould affect immune response to vaccinat ion.
To avoi d skewing the recrui ted subject populat ion, no greater than 25% of enrolled subjects who 
discontinued any S1P modulator due to associated lymphopenia can have an ALC <0.5 x 109/Lon

enrolled who discont inued an S1P modulator due to associa ted lymphopenia must have an ALC ≥ 
0.5 x 109/Lwithin 6 mo nths prior to enrollment. 
1.3.5 Rationale for Selected V accines
This study will examine response to Tdap, PPSV23 ,and seasonal influenza vaccines by measuring
responses that act through different immune response pathways. Both T cell -dependent and T cell -
independent humoral responses will be assessed in this study . 
Tdap
The tetanus toxoi d com ponent of Tdap , whi ch has rem ained unchanged over time, has been used
consistent ly in trials with other DMTs, including fingo limod, and serves a “benchmark” 
vaccination (
Boulton, 2012 ; Kappos, 2015 ). Vaccinat ionagainst tetanus is recommended on a 
recurring 10-year basis except following certain potenti al exposures to Clostridium tetani or its 
toxoi d (CDC , 2020 
; 
STIKO , 2017 ). The inact ivated tetanus toxoid is apepti de antigen thatinduces 
a T-cell dependent response (Lesinski, 2 001
; 
Przedpelski
, 2020 ). Mos tindividuals inthe USand 
Germ anyhave been vaccinated with tetanus toxoid (Poethko -Muller, 2013 
; 
Williams, 2016
). The
tetanus vaccine is commo nly administered in adult s as a booster vaccine along with pertussis and 
diphtheria vaccines and can be administered as early as 1 year after previous vaccination as well 
as safely administered at the same time as other vaccines (Halperin 2006 
; 
Pool
, 2020 ).Response
to tetanus toxoid will serve as the primary endpo int for this study . Inform ation about Tdap can be 
found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap -tdap

PPSV23
PPSV23 is a mixture of purified capsular polysaccharides from 23 Streptococcus pneumoniae 
seroty pes and allow for assessment of a T -cell independent immune response ( Malley , 
2005 
).
Immu ne response to the PPSV23 in this study  will be based on response to seroty pes thatare 
associ ated wi th an increased ri sk of invasive and/or severe disease (Malley, 2005

Seasonal Influenza Vaccine
Seasonal influenza vaccine generates a T-cell dependent recall for vaccine response (Korenkov, 
2018 ). The seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for all MS subjects by the AAN and by
STIKO guidelines ( STIKO, 2017 ; Farez, 2019 ).
1.3.6 Rationale for Selected Endpoints
Primary Endpoint
Tetanus Toxoid Immune Response -The proporti on of subjects with serol ogic response to 
tetanus toxoi din the Tdap vaccine will serve as the primary endpo int in this study . Serol ogic 
response to tetanus toxoid is measured by compar ing theanti-tetanus toxoid IgG antibody  titers at 
4 weeks post-vaccinat ioncomparedto thepre-vaccination titers. The antibody  titers will be 
measured by an ELISA method . Subjects with a pre-vaccinat ion IgG antibody titer level 
≤0.10 IU/m L will have a serol ogic response if post-vaccinat ion titer levels are ≥0.40 IU/m L. To 
demonstrate a serologic response if pre -vaccinat ion titer levels are>0.10 IU/mL and ≤2.7IU/mL, 
subjects will have at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titers. If subjects have a pre-
vaccination titer level > 2.7 IU/mL , they willhave at least a 2 -fold incr ease in t iters to demonstrate 
a response. This endpo int is supported by the recommendat ions to manufactures of tetanus 
vaccines to establish immune response which stipulates 0.10 IU/m L as a seroprotective level 
against tetanus and establish esincreased Ab titers needed to demonstrate immune response based 
on pre- vaccinat ion titer level (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 980, Annex 5 ). The requirement 
for aserol ogic response above the upper baseline level of 2.7 IU/mL as a 2-fold increase is 
supported by the WHO recommendations to establish tetanus vaccine efficacy ,as well as by 
research demonstrating subjects with higher baseline titers are associated with less than a 4-fold 
response to vaccinat ion (Petras, 2018; Halperin, 2018 ).Assessing the tetanus toxoi d vaccine 
immune response at 4 weeks is alsorecommended by the WHO Technical Report Series, No. 980,
Annex 5 and co incides with peak humoral immune response in adults ( Blatter, 2009 ).

by compar ing the IgG antibody  titers at 4 weeks post vaccinat ion to the pre-vaccinatio n
concentration. The antibody  titers will be measured by an ELISA method. Of the 23 serotypes
contained in PPSV23 , there is a subset associ ated with increased risk of invasive and/or severe

Weinberger, 2010 ). Thesesubtypes will be assessed in this study  for pneumococcal vaccinat ion 
immune response. The proporti on of subject swith at least a 2-fold increase in post-vaccinat ion 
anti-pne umococcal  polysaccharide IgG titers in at least 5 of these seroty pes will constitute the 
primary  analysis for serologic response toPPSV23.  Serologic response will also be determined 
separately  for allselected serotype s. Addit ional secondary  endpo ints toassess PPSV23 vaccine 
response are the proportion of subjects withanti-pneumococcal po lysaccharide IgG concentratio n 
≥1.3 μg/mL for the selected seroty pes indicat ive of seroprotecti on. The increase in antibody 
polysaccharide vaccine criteria (ie,2-fold increase) is substant iated by studi es that show most 
subjects with a pre-vaccinat ion titer of ≥1.3 mg/mL can mount a 2-fold increase in titer on

response to vaccinat ion in unprotected subjects has been defined as conversio n to a protected
concentration (1.3 μg/mL) with a 2 -fold rise in ant ibody  concentration in at least 70% of serotypes
tested ( Orange, 2012; LaFon, 2018 ). In addit ion, in a studycompar ing anti-pneum ococcal  vaccine
antibody titersfrom the same specimens tested across multiple reference laboratori es, the resul ts
for algorithms using a 2-fold cutoff were consistent between laboratories but a 4-fold increase
criteria led to disparit y across l abs with lowconcordance (Daly, 2015 ).
Exploratory Endpoints
2021 -2022 Seasonal Influenza ––The proporti on of subjects with a serologic response to the 
influenza vaccine will be assessed in this study . Serol ogic response to the influenza vaccine is 
measured by compar ing the anti-influenza IgG and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antib ody titersto 
each strain at 4 weeks post-vaccinat ion to the pre-vaccination concentrati on. The antibody  titers 
will be measured by hemagglut ination inhibit ion(HI). Subjects with a  pre-vaccinat ion IgG 
antibody  titer < 1:10 will have a serol ogic response if their post-vaccinat ion level is ≥1:40. To 
demonstrate a serologic response if pre-vaccination titer levels ≥ 1:10, subjects will have at least 
a 4-fold titer increase in post-vaccination titers.The assessment will be calculated separately for 
each ant igen/strain, and combined, ie,for proportions of subjects who m eet responder cri teria for 
at least one antigen. Addit ional endpo ints are HIantibody  titers ≥ 1:40 indicative of seroprotection 
and the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT )ratio of pre- and post-vaccinat iontiters for each strain. 
These criteria are supported by the Guidance on Harm onizat ion of Requirements for Influenza 
vaccines, EMA, 1997 and FDA Guidance, 2007 . The EMA guidance also recommends for 
demonstrating overall  vaccine immuno logic response to determine if a proportion of subjects meet 
specified criteria based onthe endpo ints.Successful vaccinat ion is achieved for each treatm ent 
armand for each influenza strain if at least one of the following three criteria is achieved :1) The 
number of subjects with serol ogic response > 40%; 2) T he Geom etric Mean Concentration ( GMC)
ratio ofpost-vaccinat ion antibody titers compared to pre- vaccinat ion is > 2.5 ; or, 3) The proportion 
of subjects achieving a hemagglut inin titer ≥1:40 is > 70%.Results of successful vaccinat ion for 
each treatment group per strain will be reported.

Diphtheria Toxoid Immune Response - The proporti on of subjects with serol ogic response to 
the diphtheria toxoi d in the Tdap vaccine will be assessed in this study . Serologic response to 
diphtheria toxoi d is measured by co mpar ing the IgG anti-diphtheria antibody  titers at 4 weeks post-
vaccination to the pre -vaccinat ion titers. The ant ibody  titers will be measured by ELISA. Subjects 
with a pre -vaccination IgG ant ibody  titer level of ≤0.10 IU/m L will have a serologic response if 
post-vaccination levels are ≥0.40 IU/mL. To demonstrate a serologic response if pre-vaccinat ion 
titer levels are >0.10 IU/m L and ≤ 2.56 IU/m L, subjects will have at least a 4-fold increase in 
post-vaccination titers. If subjects have a pre -vaccinat ion titer >2.56 IU/mL, they will have at least 
a 2-fold post-vaccinat ion increase in titers to demo nstrate a response. This endpo int to assess 
diphtheria vaccine response is supported by  the recommendat ions to m anufacturers of diphtheria 
vaccines (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 980, Annex 4) which stipulates 0.10 IU/mL as a 
seroprotective lev el against diphtheria and established the demo nstrati on of the increased Ab t iters 
needed to demonstrate immune response based on pre -vaccinat ion titer level. The use of an upper 
baseline level above which a 2-fold increase is  requi red to demonstrate serologic response is 
supported by the WHO recommendat ions to establish diphtheri a as well vaccine efficacy  and by 
research that demonstrates subjects with higher baseline diphtheri a titers are associated with less 
than a 4 -fold increase in titers ( Halperin, 2018 ). 
Addit ional secondary endpoints to assess diphtheria vaccine serologic response are the proportion 
of subjects wi th anti-diphtheria toxoid IgG ≥0.1 indicat ive of seroprotecti on, and the GMCratio 
of pre-and post -vaccin ation ant i-diphtheria toxoi d IgG and IgM titers.
Pertussis –The proportion of subjects with a serol ogic response to pertussis toxoi din the Tdap 
vaccine will be assessed in this study. Serologic response to the pertussis toxoid component of the 
pertussi s vaccine is demonstrated by co mpar ing the IgG antibody  titers at 4 weeks post-vaccinat ion 
to the pre-vaccinat ion concentrati on. The antibody titers will be measured by ELISA. Pertussis 
toxin isa key virulence factor that is specific for B. pertussis and responsible for most systemic 
symptoms associ ated with pertussis disease (Carbonetti , 2010; Dewan, 2020 ) and the pertussis 
toxoi d will  be assessed for vaccine response in this study. Subjects with a pre -vaccinat ion level o f 
< 5 EL.U./mL will have a serol ogic response to pertussis toxoi d if post-vaccinat ion antibody 
concentrations are ≥20 EL.U./m L. To demonstrate a serol ogic response if pre-vaccinat ion titer 
levels ≥ 5 EL.U./mL and < 20 EL.U./mL, subjects will have at least a 4-fold increase in post-
vaccination titers. If subjects have a pre-vaccinat ion titer level ≥ 20 EL.U./mL, they will have at 
least a 2 -fold post -vaccinat ion increase in titers to demonstrate a response. The baseline levels and 
subsequent response have been validated in clinical studies for the assessment of response to 
pertussi s vaccine (Blatter, 2009 ). Addit ional secondary  endpo ints to assess pertussis vaccine 
serol ogic response are the proporti on of subjects with anti-pertussis t oxoid IgG ≥ 5 EL.U./mL 
indicat iveof seroprotecti on, and the GMCratio of pre-and post -vaccinat ion anti-pertussi stoxoid 
IgGand IgM titers.

Pharmacokinet ic (PK)samples will only be collected in subjects who receive ozanim od as their 
DMT to characterize the plasma levels of ozanimod and its main major active metabolite (ie,
CC112273). Plasma concentrati ons of ozanimod and metabo lites will be determined in plasma 
using a validated bioanalyt ical method.
One PK sample shoul d be collected early during the Day 1 and Day 28 Visits, and the time of 
sample collect ion must be recorded. In addi tion, the time of  the most recent ozanim od dose pri or 
to PK sample collect ion must be recorded. For subjects who stay at the site for 
 
hours or more 
after the first PK sample collection, a second PK sample should be collected immediately prior to 
visit co mpletion and the time of co llection should be recorded. For subjects receiving an ozanim od 
dose after the fi rst PK sam ple collect ion and before visit com pletion, a second PK sam ple should 
be collected immediately prior to vi sit com pletion and the time of collect ion shoul d be recorded.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) samples will be collected in all subjects at the Day 1and Day 28 visits.
Pharmacokinet icand PD resul ts may be analyzed for subject medicat ion compliance, concomitant 
effects, and other analyses related to immune response.

3.1 Study Design
The proposed study  is a Phase 3b, multicenter, open -label ,study to evaluate the immuno logical 
response to ,and the safet y of,vaccines in subjects with RMS who receive oral ozanim od 0.92 mg, 
non-pegylated IFN-β, or no DMT . The overall study d esign is presented in Figure 1.The schedule 
of events is presented in Table 3.
The study  will include two cohorts different iated by  the vaccines administered. Cohort 1 
comprises subjects who receive Tdap, PPSV23, and the seasonal inact ivated influenza vaccine. 
Cohort 2 comprises subjects who have already received the seasonal influenza vaccine. As a 
resul t, Cohort 2 s ubjects will receive Tdap and PPSV23 ,only.  Initiation of Cohort 2 will be 
based on the availabilit y of eligible subjects who have not previously been vaccinated with the 
seasonal inact ivated influenza vaccine. Subjects who meet all eligibilit y criteria but have already  
received the influenza vaccine as described in Exclusion Criterion#13,will be enrolled in 
Cohort 2. Subjects who meet all eligibilit y criteria, incl uding ExclusionCriterion#13, will 
continue to be enrolled in Cohort 1 throughout the tim e both cohorts are open for enrollment.
Cohort 2 may be opened for enrollment at any  time determined by the Sponsor, but is est imated 
to occur after no less than 60% of subjects of the planned of the planned total enrollment have 
been recruited into Cohort 1.
No greater than 25% of subjects in either treatm ent arm who discont inued an S1P m odulator due 
to S1P modulator- associated lymphopenia will be enrolled who have an ALC <0.5 X 109/L. This 
thresho ld corresponds to approximately the 25thof ALCs mean level s observed in the ozanimod 
pivotal  trials.
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the International Council on Harmo nisat ion 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceut icals for Hum an Use/ Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory  requi rements.

Date 29NOV 2022 38Screening Period
Subjects who have signed theinformed consent form (ICF) will undergo screening evaluat ions to 
determine eligibilit y. The screening period may last from -14 to Day 1 (Baseline) .Eligible subjects 
can enter the active treatment/vaccinat ion peri od.
The Screening requi rements can be perform ed on the same day as Day 1, provided that all 
Screening requi rements are completed before any Day 1 assessment s and vaccine administrati on
is performed. In this case ,Day 1 assessments that are also conducted as Screening assessments do 
not have to be duplicated ,including pregnancy screening.
Because the vaccines administered in this study are approved vaccines, they do not require 
laboratory  testing prior to administrati on and are typically administered on the same day wi thout 
a prior monitoring period in a broad range of the general popul ation. Conducting Screening and 
Day 1 assessments on the same day  is considered acceptable .
Active Treatment /Vaccination Period
At the Day 1 Visit, e ligible subjects in Cohort 1 will have pre- vaccinat ion blood samples collected 
(for titer determinat ion), fo llowed by  administration of the fo llowing three vaccines:
Tdap booster vaccine
PPSV23
Seasonal influenza v accine
At the Day 1 Visit, e ligible subjects in Cohort 2 will have pre- vaccinat ion blood samples collected
(for titer determinat ion), fo llowed by  administration of the fo llowing twovaccines:
Tdap booster vaccine
PPSV23
The vaccines administered in this study  are commercially available and approved in the
jurisdict ions of the clinical  sites,and administration will occur in accordance wi th the drug l abel.
After Day  1,the post -treatm ent follow-up peri od starts .
Post-Treatment Follow Up Period
The post treatment follow-up period spans 28days,with one visit at post-vaccinat ion Day 28, 
during which subjects will return to the site to have blood samples collected (for serologica l 
determinat ions)and adverse events (AE) recorded. Upon complet ion of the Day 2 8Visit, subjects 
have co mpleted the study .
Relapse Assessments
Subjects who experi ence worsening neuro logical symptoms during the study  should contact the 
Invest igator and describe their symptom s, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. The 
Invest igator will also inquire about worsening neurol ogical  symptom s at the Day 28Visit. If, in 
the opinio n of the Invest igator, the worsening neurological symptoms are potentially due to a nMS 
relapse, a relapse visit shoul d be scheduled within 7days of site contact. The following 
manifestations are considered consistent with an MS relapse: monophasic clinical episode with

6.1 Screening P eriod
Screening evaluat ions will be performed for all subjects to determine study  eligibilit y. These 
evaluat ions m ust be com pleted wi thin 14days prior to the Day 1 visit. If screening procedures 
cannot be completed within 14days, the Medical Monitor must be co ntacted to discuss whether 
any Screening procedures must be repeated prior to enrollment . All screening assessments and 
procedures are to be performed by the Principal Investigator (PI)or a qualified designee.
Written, si gned, and dated informed consent f rom the subject prior to the performance of any
study -related procedures must be obtained by the PIor desi gnee . A copy  of thesigned informed 
consent or second original informed consent, signed by  both parti es (depending on local 
requi rements) ,must be gi ven to the subject for his/her records. 
Safety laboratory  analyses and all assessments will be performed centrally . Screening l aboratory  
values must demonstrate subject eligibilit y, but m ay be repeated wi thin the screening window ,if 
necessary .

6.2.2 Relapse Assessments
A relapse is defined as a monophasic clinical episode with subject -reported symptoms and 
objective findings ty pical of mul tiple sclerosi s, reflecting a focal or mult ifocal inflammatory  
demyelinat ing event in the CNS, developing acutely or sub acutely , with a durati on of  at 
least 24hours, with or without recovery, and in the absence of fever or infection ( Thompson, 
2018 ). Subjects who experie nce worsening neuro logical symptoms during the study  shoul d 
contact the Investigator site and describe their symptoms, ideally wit hin 48 hours of symptom 
onset. If, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the worsening neuro logical symptom s are potenti ally 
dueto a MS relapse, an unscheduled relapse visit should be planned as soon as possible , ideally  
within 7 days of symptom onset. The unscheduled relapse visit will be conducted if a possible 
relapse i s suspected at any  time pri or to the Day  28 visi t. The Investigator will also inquire about 
worsening neurological symptoms at the Day  28 Visit. The fo llowing evaluations will be 
perform ed as specifi edin Table 3:

The relapse visit can take place at the same day as the Day 28 Visit. If relapse occurs at Day 28
visit, assessments do not have to be duplicated.
Subject s who experi ence a rel apse may receive treatm ent wi th IV corti costeroi ds, if judged to be 
clinically appropri ate by the Invest igator. The following standardized treatm ent regimen shoul d 
be used: as warranted, up to 1.0 g IV methylprednisolone per day for a maximum o f 5consecutive 
days. No deviation from the standardized treatm ent regimen is allowed unless approved by the 
Medical Monitor. The Investigator is asked to draw antibody  titers pri or to s teroid administrati on 
during an unscheduled relapse visit, regardless of its proximit y to th e Day 28 Visit. Blood draw 
for antibody  titers will also occur at the Day 28 Visi t. 
The analysis of any relapses captured during the study  will be descript ive.
6.3 Follow -up Period
Not applicable .
6.4 Efficacy Assessment
The immuno logical response is measured by comparing post-to pre-vaccinat iontiters or 
concentrations ofand IgG and IgM antibodies against vaccine antigens as described in detail in 
Table 2 .
Serol ogical  response to vaccines is generally characteri zed as a 2 or 4-fold increase in titers if 
subjects are above levels of seroprotecti on at baseline. If subjects are below levels of 
seroprotection at baseline, serol ogic response is generally measured by dem onstrating a response 
above seroprotecti on criteria. The specific levels are based on vaccine guidelines and are consistent  
with other studi es of immune response with concomitant immuno modulatory  treatments. 
Addit ional assessments woul d include evaluat ion of the GMT ratio post-to pre-vaccinat ion 
antibody  titers. 
For vaccines utilized in the study  containing a singl e com ponent, the response of that com ponent 
will be measured. For PPSV23 and pertussis vaccines, important subcomponents will be assessed 
in the primary  analysis of these vaccines for immune response. All antigens contained wi thinthe 
seasonal influenza vaccine will be assessed for immune response s. 
6.5 Pharmacokinetics
PK samples will only be collected in subjects who receive ozanimod as their standard of care 
treatm ent, to characterize the plasma levels of ozanimod and its main metabo lites (ie,CC112273 ). 
Plasma concentrations of ozanimod and metabo lites will be determined in plasma using a validated 
bioanalyt ical method.
One PK sample shoul d be collected early during the Day 1 and Day 28Visits, and the time of 
sample collect ion must be recorded. In addi tion, the time of  the most recent ozanim od dose pri or

vaccine expiration date and vigorously shake the pre-filled syringes. The contents of the syringe 
shoul d appear as a homogeneous solution without particulate matters or discoloration. Vaccine 
batch and lot number must be documented. 
7.2 Treatment Administration and Schedule 
At the Day 1  V isit, eligible subjects will have pre-vaccinat ion blood samples collected (for 
serol ogicaldeterminat ions), followed by parenteral administration of Tdap, PPSV23, and seasona l 
inact ivated influenza vaccine (Cohort 1), or Tdap and PPSV23 (Cohort 2). 
The vaccines administered in this study  are commercially available and approved in the 
jurisdict ions of the clinical sites,and administration will occur in accordance with the product
label s. After Day  1 the post- treatm ent follow-up peri od starts.
Post-vaccination 
After vaccinat ion,subjects shoul d be observed for approximately 15 minutes , or as per 
recommended local guideli nes, whichever is longer, for development of hypersensit ivity reactions. 
Shoul d hypersensit ivity react ions occur , the Investi gator should record the event as an AEand
shoul d monitor pulse and blood pressure .The Investigator must determine if treatm ent with 
steroi d, antihistamines, epinephrine/adrenaline, or hospital admissio n is warranted and act 
accordingly. If no hypersensit ivity react ions devel op or a mild to moderate hypersensit ivity 
reacti on has stabilized, subjects can leave the site. Subjects shoul d be informed that over the 
counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen (paracetam ol) can be used to treat post-vaccinat ion pain or 
fever ,but subjects shoul d refrain from using anti-pyretic treatments, including acetaminophen, 
aspirin, and other NSAIDs for a minim um of  6 hours post-vaccinat ion (Scheifele, 2018; Doedee, 
2014 ).
Vaccine administration must conform with the label requi rements and must beperformed by 
someone who is experienced in intramuscular and subcutaneous administration of medicinal 
products. Sites must have epinephrine or adrenaline medicat ion available that can be administered 
in case of anaphylact ic reacti ons. Subjects shoul d be stably  seated or reclined before and during 
vaccine administration to avoid injuries from falls orin case of syncopal react ions. Standard 
hygiene pract ices should be applied during vaccine administration, including skin disinfect ion with 
alcoho l swaps at the site of vaccine administrati on and hand cleaning or wearing gloves by the 
person administering the vaccine. The seasonal influenza vaccine and Tdap must be administered 
intramuscularly , and PPSV23 shoul d be administered subcutaneously. The recommended 
anatomical site of administrati on for each vaccine is listed in Table 4. Only one vaccine must be 
administered per anatomical site. On the day that the vaccine is administered, subjects who receive 
IFN-βinject ions m ust not have IFN-βadministered at a site of vaccine administration.

Intramuscular administration 
A sterile needle for intramuscular inject ion (28to 25 gauge) of appropri ate length shoul d be 
attached to the prefilled syringe and a separate needl e must be used for each vaccine. The needle 
shoul d enter the skin at a 90 -degree angle and the vaccine should be administered at approximately 
the center of the del toid muscle. Deeper administration in the muscle mass is generally associated 
with fewer adverse reacti ons compared with injecti ons close to th e subcutaneous tissue. Table 5
lists the needle length for adults based on weight, which is based on CDC recommendat ions 
(https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3084.pdf ). Once the needle is inserted to themuscle tissue, 
the vaccine is injected, followed by withdrawal  of the needle. A simple band aid can be used to 
cover the inject ion site. 
Subcutaneous administration 
A sterile needle for subcutaneous inject ion (23 to 25 gauge; 16 mm [5/8 inch] length) should be 
attached to the prefilled syringe and a separate needl e must be used for each vaccine. The skin at 
the inject ion site shoul d be elevated between thumb and index finger of the vaccinator and the 
needle should enter the skin at approximately a 45 -degree angle. Once the needle is inserted in the 
subcutaneous tissue, the vaccine is injected, followed by wit hdrawal of the needle. A simple band 
aid can be used to cover the inject ion site.

Detailed methodology  for summary  and stati stical analyses o f the data collected in this study  will 
be docum ented in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be maintained by the Sponsor. 
9.1 Overview
This is a non-rando mized, open -label study  in which all subjects remain on their pre-study 
(baseline) treatm ent per protocol. Subjects will be recrui ted by invest igators from MS clinical 
practi ce patients and prospectively assessed for immune response to vaccinat ion.  The statistical 
analyses will focus on estimat ing immune response rates, adjust ing for baseline subject -level 
characterist ics.No formal statist ical hypothesis is evaluated . To mit igate for potential differences 
in the recrui ted subject popul ation in the ozanimod and non -ozanim od arm s that potenti allycould 
affect immune response ,response rates will be estimated based on a logistic regressio n model 
adjusting forseveral factors, eg,age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and baseline absolute 
lymph ocyte coun t (ALC). The resul ts of the statistical analyses for immune response endpo ints 
will be summarized for subjects receiving ozanimod (ozanimod arm) and subjects not receiving 
ozanimod (non-ozanim od arm) as their standard of care disease modifying therapy  for MS.
Analyses of safety will be summarized by descri ptive statistics separately for the ozanimod and 
non-ozanim od arm s.
9.2 Study Population Definitions
The study  will include two cohorts different iated by the vaccines administered. Cohort 1 comprises 
subjects who receive Tdap, PPSV23, and the seasonal inact ivated influenza vaccine. Cohort 2 
comprises subjects who receive Tdap and PPSV23 only. Initiationof Cohort 2 will be based on 
the availabilit y of eligible subjects who have not previously been vaccinated with the seasona l 
inact ivated influenza vaccine .
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populat ion consists of all subjects who received at least one 
vaccination and summarized according to their initial treatm ent status (ozanimod vs. non-
ozanimod) regardless of systemic use of cortico steroi ds.
The per-protocol (PP) populat ion consists of all subjects who received the correctly  assigned 
vaccinations, had no steroid use, and did not receive any other vaccines through out the study .
9.3 Sample Size and Power Considerations
The sample size of the study is 60 subjects with an estimated 30 subjects expected to have received
ozanimod and 30 subjects expected to not have received ozanimod as standard of care DMT. It is 
expected that approximately 60% of the subjects not receiving ozanim od as standard of care 
therapy  will have a serol ogic response to vaccinat ion with Tdap (Kappos, 2015 ). 
With a sample size of 30 subjects for the ozanimo d arm, assumin g the response rate is 45%, the 
expected half width of the 95% confidence interval (based on normal approximat ion) is 
approximately  0.175.We note that in simulat ions (assuming a true response rate of 0.45), the 
estimated response rate falls within 0.267 and 0.633 among 95% of the simulated trials(across 
100,000 simulat ions).

on the mITTpopulat ion:
Subject ’s age, height, weight, and baseline characteri stics will be summarized using descript ive 
statist ics, while sex, race and other categorical variables will be provi ded using frequenc y 
tabul ations.  Medical history  data will be summari zed using frequency tabulat ions byMedical 
Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities(MedDRA )system  organ class and preferred term.
9.5 Subject Disposition
The fo llowing summaries will be provided by treatment status (ozanimod vs non -ozanim od) based 
on the mITT populat ion.
The number and percentage o f subject s will be summarized. Subject disposit ion, including the 
number of subject s who enrolled, completed the trial, and discont inued the trial wit h reasons for 
discontinuat ion. Subject demographics include age, sex, race, ethnicit y, height, wei ght, and body 
mass index.
Baseline characterist ics include age at MS symptom onset, age at MS diagnosis, years since MS 
symptom  onset, y ears since MS di agnosis, number of relapses within the last 12 months, number 
of relapses wi thin the last 24 m onths, and number of GdE l esions.
9.6 Immune Response Analysis
The primary endpoint analysis and all analyses for immune -response to vaccinat ion will be 
perform ed in the per-protocol popul ation, ie,in subjects who received the correctly assigned 
vaccinations and had no major protocol  violations. Sensit ivity analyses will be conducted within 
the mITT popul ation consist ing of all subjects who received at least one vaccinat ion and 
summarized according to thei r initial treatm ent status (ozanimod vs non-ozanimod) regardl ess of 
protocol  violations 
If Cohort 2 is initiated, then not all subjects will receive the seasonal inact ivated influenza vaccine.   
For the purposes of summarizing the Tdap and PPSV23 v accines ,all subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 
will be combined, since they generally woul d have had the opportuni ty to receive all three 
vaccines.  Forevaluat ingthe seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine, the analyses will be based on 
Cohort 1 subjects. 
The ozanimod and non -ozanim od treatm entgroup immune response rates and differences will be 
estimated based on a model adjusting for baseline demographics (eg, age, gender, BMI, baseline 
ALC, etc).We no te theestimates of treatment differences shoul d be inter preted with caut ion, since, 
in addition to the limi ted sam ple size, the ozanim od and non -ozanimod arms are not randomized. 
Some or all of theaforementi oned factors may not be feasible to include in the analysis model. 
Analysis details will be provi ded in the statistical analysis plan such as the requi red number of 
subjects within each factor stratum (eg, if within a factor stratum level there are less than 10 
subjects, then that factor will be excluded from the model).

10.1 Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in 
a subject during the course of astudy . It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomi tant impairment of the subject ’s health, including 
laboratory  test values (asspecified by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (ie,any clinically  significant adverse change in the frequency or intensit y of a  pre-
exist ing condit ion) shoul d be consi dered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrom e shoul d be recorded on 
the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include mo nitoring of 
any or all  of the following param eters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , pathol ogical,
physical examinat ion findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures.
All AE s will be recorded by the Invest igator from the t ime the subject signs informed consent unt il 
28days after the vaccine administrati on,as well as those serious adverse events (SAEs )made 
known to the I nvest igator at any t ime thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP.   All AEs
(serious/non -serious) will be recorded on the CRF and in the subject’s source docum ents.  Refer 
to Section 10.5 for instructi ons on how to report SAEs to Drug Safet y. 
All AEs related to SARS -CoV -2 must be co llected continuously dur ing the study  including at the 
safet y follow visi t(s). After the init ial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively  
follow each parti cipant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non -serious AEs, including 
SARS -COV -2 will be fo llowed u ntil reso lution, until the condit ion stabilizes, unt il the event is 
otherwi se explained, or until the participant is lost to fo llow-up. COVID -19 rel ated AEs/SAEs 
will be captured in specific clinical safet y program CRF pages
10.2 Evaluation of A dverse Events
A qualified Invest igator will evaluate all AEs as to: 
10.2.1 Seriousness 
AnSAE is any  AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death ;
Is life-threatening (ie,in the opinion of the Investi gator ,the subject is at immediate risk of
death fro m the AE) ;
Requi resinpat ient hospitalizati on or prolongat ion of existing hospi talizati on (hospi talizati on
is defined as an inpat ient admissio n, regardl ess of length of stay );
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty (a substantial disrupt ion of the subject ’s
abilit y to conduct normal life funct ions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect ;
Const itutes an important medical event .
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death, hospi talization, or disabilit y, but may jeopardi ze the subject or

and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered
serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi talizati ons for:
routine treatm ent or m onitorin g of the studi ed indicati on not associ ated wi th any deteri oration 
in condi tion.
aprocedure for protocol/disease -related invest igations (eg, sampling for laboratory tests) 
However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospi talizati on for a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
hospitalizati on or prol ongat ion of hospitalizati on for technical, pract ical, or soci al reasons, in 
absence of an AE.
aprocedure that is planned (ie,planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
docum ented in the source docum ent and the CRF.  Hospitalizati on or prolonged hospi talizati on 
for a com plicati on remains a reportabl e SAE.
an elect ive treatm ent of  or an elective procedure for a pre-exist ing condi tion,unrel ated to the 
studi ed in dicat ion, that has not worsened from baseline. 
emergency outpati ent treatm ent or observation that does not resul t in admissi on, unless 
fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
For each AE, the Invest igator will provi de inform ation on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the IP, acti on taken regarding the IP, and outcome.
10.2.2 Severity /Intensity
For each AE, the Invest igator must assess the severity/ intensit y of the event.

Date 29NOV 2022 61Interference with ADLs including inabilit y to perform  daily social and functional act ivities (eg, 
absenteeism and/or b ed rest)
Drug therapy  is requi red
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate,
or severe myocardial  infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medica l 
significance (such as sev ere headache).  This criterio n is notthe same as “serious” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or funct ioning.  
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3 Causality
The Investi gator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IPand the 
occurrence of an AE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relati onship of the adverse event to IPadministration is 
unlikely or remote , or other medicat ions, therapeutic intervent ions, 
or underlying condi tions provi de a sufficient explanation for the 
observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP caused 
the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the adverse event.
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for each AE based on currently  available information.  
Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional  informat ion beco mes available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional IPthat 
has not been manufactured or provided by Celg ene, pl ease provi de the name of  the manufacturer 
when reporting the event.
10.2.4 Duration
For each AE, t he Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event.
10.2.5 Action Taken
The Investi gator will report the action taken with IPas a result of each AE, as applicable (eg, 
discontinuat ion, interruption, or dose reducti on of IP, as appropriate) and report if conco mitant 
and/or addit ional treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6 Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the ev ent for each AE.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be fo llowed unt il recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ).

The Investi gator should establish causali ty further and liver function evaluat ion shoul d be 
perform ed (for example, coagul ation panel and alkaline phosphatase) in consultat ion with the 
Medical Monitor.
10.4 Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject of childbearing 
poten tial or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events.
Any subject with a suspected or confirmed pregnancy shoul d discontinue ozanimod and consult  
the medical mo nitor.  
10.4.1 Females of Childbearing Potential
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-hCG or posi tive pregnancy test in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject i s 
enrolled in the study  are considered immediately reportabl e events.  Apregnancy , suspected 
pregnancy , or posit ive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet yimmediately by 
email, phone or facsimile, or other appropri ate method, using the Pregnancy Init ial Report Form , 
or approved equivalent form .  
The female subject may be referred to an obstetri cian-gyneco logist or another appropriate 
healt hcare professio nal for further evaluat ion.
The Invest igator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy and must notify 
Celgene Drug Safet y immediately a bout the outcome of the pregnancy (either norm al or abnormal 
outcom e) using the Pregnancy  Follow-up Report Form or approved equivalent form .
If the outcome o f the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion ), the Invest igator should 
report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any o f the serious criteria, 
it must be report ed as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safet y within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s 
knowl edge of the event.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 da ys of birth shoul d be reported, without regard to 
causalit y, as an SAE.  In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Invest igator suspects is 
related to the in-utero exposure to the IPshould also be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safet y 
within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge of the event .
10.4.2 Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject enrolled in the study beco mes pregnant, the male subject 
shoul d notify  the Invest igator, and the pregnant female partner shoul d be advised to call their 
healt hcare provider immediately .  
10.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any serious criterion requi res reporting as an SAE within 24 hours of the 
Invest igator’s knowledge of the event .This instruction pertains to initial SAE report s as well as

Date 29NOV 2022 64This requi rement applies to all SAEs (regardl ess of relat ionship to IP)that occur during the study 
(from the time the subject signs informed consent until 28days after vaccine administrati on) or 
any SAE made known to the Invest igator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related 
to IP .  Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatm ent (after signing the ICF) are to be recorded 
within the CRF, but do not require reporting to Celgene Drug S afety .
Where requi red by local legislat ion, the Invest igator i s responsible for informing the Inst itutional 
Review Board/Ethics Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant init ial 
and follow-up informat ion about the event. The Invest igator must keep copies of all SAE 
inform ation on file including correspondence wit h Celgene and the IRB/EC.
The SAE is recorded within the CRF, and the data is transmi tted el ectroni cally  to C elgene Drug
Safety. In the event electronic transmissio n is not available, a paper SAE Report Form  will be
completed and sent direct ly to Celgene Drug Safety, ensuring the event is recorded on the CRF as 
well.
10.6 Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting, Celgene Drug Safet y will determ ine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to ozanimod based on the Invest igator Brochure.
In the United States, expedited reports sent to the FDA by the sponsor based on the reasonable 
possibilit y thresho ld are known as ‘IND safet y reports’ and will be reported in accordance with 21 
CFR 312.32.
For reporti ng to the FDA, events that are not suspected to be causally related to IPby the sponsor 
will not be considered adverse react ions. 
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized representative 
will report in an expedi ted manner to Regul atory  Authori ties and Ethics Committees concerned, 
suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) in accorda nce with Directive 
2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verificat ion and presentation of adverse 
reacti on reports arising from clinical trials on investigat ional products for human use (ENTR/CT3) 
and also in accordance with country -specific requirem ents. 
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting in the EEA, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the 
expectedness of events suspected of being related to BOOSTRIX®, PNEUMOVAX23®, and the 
seasonal inact ivated influenza vaccine based on the US Prescribi ng Inform ation (USPI) or EU 
Summary  of Product Characteristics (SmPC) .
Serious adverse reacti ons and nonseri ous adverse reactions will be reported to the Regul atory 
Authori ties, in accordance with Regulat ion (EC) No. 726/2004 and/or Direct ive 2001/83/EC as 
amended, and also in accordance wit h country -specific requirements for countries within the EEA.

docum entati on of this study are designed to ensure th at Celgene, its authorized representative ,and 
Invest igator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in International Conference on 
Harm onisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance wit h the general ethical principles outlined 
in the Declarat ion of Helsinki. The study  will receive approval  from an IRB/EC prior to 
commencement. The Invest igator will conduct all aspects of this study  in accordance with 
applicable nat ional, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory  authori ties.
12.2 Investigator Responsibilities
Invest igator responsibilit ies are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the 
local regulat ions.  Celgene staff or an authori zed representative will evaluate and approve all 
Invest igators who in turn will select their staff.
The Invest igator shoul d ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study  treatments, as well as study -related duties and functions, 
including obligat ions of confidentialit y of Celge ne inform ation. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-invest igators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated si gnificant study-related duti es.
The Invest igator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who si gn an informed consent 
form (ICF)and are screened for entry  into the study .  Subj ects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Invest igator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi tal charts, and study -related charts) for source data 
verification.  The Invest igator must ensure timely and accurate complet ion of CRFs and queries.
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the except ion of the informat ion 
provi ded by Celgene on public registry  webs ites) is considered Celgene confident ial informat ion.  
Only information that is previously disclosed by Celgene on a public registry  website may be

Date 29NOV 2022 6812.3 Subject Information and Informed Consent
The Investigator must obtain informed consent of asubject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any  study  related procedures.
Docum entati on that informed consent occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study and 
of the informed consent process shoul d be recorded in the study  subject’s source docum ents 
including the date.  The original  ICF signed and dated by the study  subject and by the person 
consent ing the study  subject prior to the study subject’s entry  into the study, must be maintained 
in the Invest igator’s study  files and a copy  given to the study  subject.  In addi tion, if a protocol  is 
amended and it impacts on the content of  the informed consent, the ICF must be revised.  Study 
subjects participat ing in the study  when the amended protocol  is implemented must be re-
consented with the revised versi on of the ICF.  The revised ICF signed and dated by the study 
subject and by the person consent ing the study  subject must be maintained in the Invest igator’s 
study  files and a copy  given to the study  subject.
12.4 Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject 's right to protection against invasio n of privacy and to be in compliance 
with ICH and other local regulati ons (whichever is most stringent). Celgene requi res the 
Invest igator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary , representatives from 
regul atory  authori ties,to review and/or copy  any medical records relevant to the study  in 
accordance with local laws .
Shoul d direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibilit y of the Investigator to obtain such permissio n in wr iting 
from the appropri ate individual.
12.5 Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol  must be approved by the Celgene Clinical Research Physician.  
Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  Written approval must be 
obtained before implementation o f the amended version occurs.  The writte n signed approval fro m 
the IRB/ EC shoul d specifically reference the Investi gator nam e, protocol  number, study  title and 
amendment number that is applicable. Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require 
IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for informat ion purposes.
12.6 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review and 
Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protocol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will be 
submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form list ing the documents submitted, their dates

requi rements m ust be m et.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authori ties, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICFshoul d also be revised.
The Investi gator must keep a record of all communicat ion with the IRB/EC and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinat ing Invest igator and the IRB/EC. This statem ent also applies to any 
communicat ion between the Invest igator (or Coordinating Invest igator, if applicable) and 
regul atory  authori ties.
Any advert isements used to recruit subjects for the study  must be reviewed by Celgene and the 
IRB/EC prior to use.  
12.7 Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board/ Ethics Committee

Date 29NOV 2022 71If the Invest igator is unable to meet this obligati on, the Invest igator must ask Celgene for 
permission to make alternative arrangements. Details of these arrangements shoul d be 
docum ented.

14 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by Celgene or its authorized rep resentative for 
compliance wi th applicable government regulat ions wi th respect to current GCP and SOPs .
14.1 Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the 
study .  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Invest igator and the staff at a study init iation 
visit and/or at an Invest igators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study , a Celgene 
representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed consent, record 
keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator. Monitoring details describing strategy, 
including definit ion of study critical data items and processes (eg, risk-based initiatives in 
operati ons and qualit y such as risk management and mit igation strategi es and analyt ical risk-based 
monitoring), methods, responsibilit ies, and requi rements, including handling of nonco mpliance 
issues and monitoring techniques (central , remote, or on-site monitoring) are provi ded in the 
monitoring plan.
Accuracy  will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that is a direct comparison of the 
entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resul ting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investiga tor and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
correcti ons will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by the Invest igator and/or his/her staff. 
Moni toring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusio n criteria 
and docum entati on of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional monitoring 
activit ies may be outlined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an.
14.2 Audits and Inspections
In addit ion to the routine mo nitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Pract ice Qualit y Assurance uni t 
exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research activities 
in accordance wi th Celgene SOPs to eval uate compliance wi th Good Clinical  Practi ce guidelines 
and regulations.
The Invest igator is required to permit direct access to the facilit ies where the study  took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participat ion for audits 
and inspect ions by IRB/ ECs, regulatory  authori ties (eg,FDA, EMA) and company  authori zed 
represe ntatives.  The Invest igator should make every  effort to be available for the audits and/or 
inspections.  If the Invest igator is contacted by any regul atory  authori ty regarding an inspect ion, 
he/she shoul d contact Celgene immediately.

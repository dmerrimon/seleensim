Protocol Date/Version  March 2020 , Amendment  2.1  
OBJECTIVES  
To determine efficacy and safety of repeat administrations of intrathecal injections of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF 
cells), autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells [MSC] Secreting Neurotrophic Factors [NTF])  as compared to 
Placebo given three times two months apart to participants  with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis . 
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  as compared to placebo as measur ed by the 
proportion of participants  with a ≥1.25 points/month improvement in the post-treatment slope vs. pre-
treatment slope in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale ( ALSFRS -R) score  at 28 
weeks following the first treatment .  
• To evaluate the safety of  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  as compared to placebo based upon incidence of 
adverse events, laboratory evaluations, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) 
assessments and suicidal ideation as measured by the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS).  
Secondary :  
• To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) vs. placebo as measured by the proportion of 
participants  whose disease  progression  is halted or improved as measured by a 100% or greater 
improvement in post -treatment slope vs. pre -treatment slope in the ALSFRS -R score  at 28 weeks 
following the first treatment . 
• To evaluate the efficacy of  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) vs. placebo as measured by improvements in 
ALSFRS -R score bet ween baseline and 28 weeks following the first treatment.  
• To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  as compared to placebo as measured by 
improvements in the ALSFRS -R slope using different responder definitions.  
• To evaluate the efficacy of  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) as compared to placebo  by a comparison 
between treatment groups of (a) tracheostomy  free survival ; (b) change in ALSFRS -R slope over each 
post baseline visit (2 – 28 weeks) as compared to pre -treatment slope and (c) the change from baseline 
in the ALSFRS -R score to each post -baseline time point.  
• To evaluate the efficacy of  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) vs. placebo as measured by the change in SVC  
(% predicted) from baseline to 28 weeks following the first treatment.  
• To evaluate biomarkers ( NTF s, inflammatory factors , and cytokines) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
before each treatment and at select time points  as well as in serum  or blood  samples (T regulatory cells) 
throughout the study to evaluate their relationship to treatme nt with  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) .

gene variants related to ALS    
METHODOLOGY  
Study Design  This is a Phase 3  randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled multicenter stu dy that will be 
conducted in approximately 200 participants  with early ALS at multiple investigational study 
sites. After providing informed consent, each participant  will be observed over an  
approximately 1 8-week screening  period  and undergo month ly ALSFRS -R scores along with 
safety assessments  and recording of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs) will 
be obtained. During this period of time , participants  meeting the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria  will be randomized and a week later will undergo bone -marrow aspirat ion. MSC of 
the participants  randomized to the treatment group will be isolated, propagated for 
approximately  2 weeks  and then cryopreserved. Approximately  2 weeks prior to each 
treatment, MS C will be thawed, propagated and induced into MSC -NTF cells. Participants  
will undergo a total of three intrathecal (IT) transplantations with NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  
or matching placebo. The first transplantation will be at V isit 6 (Week 0) approximately 1 8 
weeks after screening, with the subsequent transplantations at V isit 9 (Week 8) and V isit 11 
(Week 16) . Following the third and last treatment , participants  will b e followed for three  
additional monthly visits  (through week 28)  during  which the ALSFRS -R assessment , 
neurological examination, biomarkers assessment, assessment of blinding, safety assessments 
and recording of concomitant medications and AEs will be performed .  
See study scheme below and schedule of assessments in Table 1 in Section  1.15 Appendix 1  
In consideration of contingency measures implemented  at participating investigative sites due 
to the outbreak of the  Coronavirus Disease 2019  (COVID -19) pandemic , and to minimize or 
eliminate immediate hazards or to protect the life and well -being of research participants (e.g., 
to limit exposure to COVID -19), some study visits may be rescheduled and/or conducted 
remotely according to  the implemented institutional policies  at individu al sites , until such a 
time when investigational sites are able to fully comply with the schedule of assessments .

Duration  Each subject’s participation w ill last for up to approximately 12 months, consisting of:  
• An up to  5-month pre-treatment  period , during which screening assessments will 
be captured, participants  will be randomized and a bone marrow aspiration (BMA) 
will be completed. In addition, efficacy and safety assessments will be performed.  
• A 4 -month treatment  period , during which the subject will receive 3 
transplantations (T1, T2, and T3) of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  and will be assessed 
for efficacy and safety.  
• A 3-month post -treatment follow -up period , after the last treatment to assess efficacy 
and safety  
Study Drug 
and 
Formulation  Study drug will be supplied in one 5 mL  syringe cont aining 4 mL  of NurOwn®(MSC -NTF 
cells) suspension at a dose of 125 x106 cells or a 5 mL syringe containing placebo (excipient) 
for IT administration . 
Dose and 
Route of 
Administration  Doses of 125 x106 NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  or placebo transplanted intrathecally at Visit 6

ASSESSMENTS  
Safety  Changes in vital signs and physical examination findings, hematology, blood chemistry, 
urinalysis, and tabulation of AEs, and changes in concomitant medications . Note  AE due to 
disease progression will be categorized as such.  
Efficacy  Efficacy assessments will be based upon the 12 item ALSFRS -R total score and its subscale 
scores . Efficacy endpoints are further described in the statistical section below.   If an ALSFRS -
R assessment cannot be complet ed in -person , it will be administered remotely . The ALSFRS -
R has been validated for ad ministration over the telephone .  During the COVID -19 pandemic, 
SVC will not be performed until such a time as institutional policies permit, to prevent viral 
contamination and reduce the risk to study participants and clinical trial staff.  
Biomarkers  CSF samples and serum samples will be collected prior to each administration of cells as well 
as at selected time points  per schedule of assessments below. CSF and/or serum or blood 
samples will be evaluated for levels of biomarkers ( such as n eurotrophic and inflammatory 
factors, cytokines)  and T regulatory cells .  
DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD  
DSMB  An independent, Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) wi ll be assembled for this Phase 
3 clinical trial. Previous clinical studies with  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  were not associated 
with any deaths or treatment -related SAEs.  The DSMB will review key safety data (at intervals 
and as requested) as outlined in the DSMB charter . 
STATISTICAL METHODS AND ANALYSIS  
Sample Size 
Calculation  Since the primary efficacy endpoint is based upon the percentage of responders who 
demonstrate a ≥ 1.25 points/month improvement in ALSFRS -R post treatment slope as 
compared to the ir pre-treatment slope, the sample size for this study is based upon extrapolation 
of the percentage of participants  on NurOwn®  (excluding slow progressors) who were 
responders at 12 weeks as observed in the previous Phase 2 BCT -001 US study.   
At 12 weeks p ost-treatment 53% of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) treated participants  were 
observed to have an improvement in post -treatment slope using either  the thresholds of  ≥ 1.0 
Points / month or ≥ 1.5 points / month.  
 
 Confidential  Page 10  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 10 of 66 
The best estimate of the percentage of placebo participants  who will be responders is based 
upon the % of responders at 24 weeks.  At 24 weeks post -treatment there were 17% of placebo 
participants  who were responders using  the threshold of  ≥ 1.0 points /mo nth improvement in 
ALSFRS -R slope and 0% using the threshold of ≥ 1.5 points /month  improvement in ALSFRS -
R slope . 
Accounting for the longer duration of the proposed study, missing data due to discontinuations  
and potentially fewer responders in the NurOwn® treated group , we estimate the true percentage 
of responders who are expected to improve ≥ 1.25 point s/month on NurOwn® to be 35% and 
on Placebo to be 15%. Utilizing a Chi -square test with Type I error rate of 0.05 two -sided and 
90% power we would requir e 97 participants  per treatment arm.  
The true % of responders in each treatment group using the criteria of ≥ 100% improvement is 
also expected to be around 35% treated and 15 %  placebo . 
A sample size of  approximately 100 participants  per arm ( approximately 200 participants  total) 
will be randomized . 
The COVID -19 pandemic may result in additional missing data or longer duration between 
visits. The full impact of this cannot be estimated at this point, however during analyses , 
considerations may be made for data collected prior to and after the start of the pandemic to 
address impact of missing data as well as longer durations between visits.  
Efficacy  The primary efficacy endpoint is based upon the ALSFRS -R functional rating scale which is a 
validated scale based upon 12 items, each rated from 0 to 4. Scores of 4 are Normal and 0 are 
the worst. Note the ALSFRS -R overall total score is between 0 and 48. The slope is determined 
by fitting a linear regression using all assessments between the time po ints mentioned.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of participants  with a ≥1.25 point/month  
improvement  in post -treatment slope vs. pre-treatment slope  in ALSFRS -R score  at 28 weeks 
from the first treatment.   
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the  ITT population which 
will be  defined as all subjects randomized.  
The modified  intent to treat ( mITT) population will be defined in this study as all participants  
who were randomized, treated and have at least three ALSFRS -R assessments: one pre -
treatment assessments of ALSFRS -R prior to the baseline assessment, a baseline assessment 
and one post -treatment assessment.  Baseline will be the ALSFRS -R assessment at the first 
transplantation visit (Week 0, Visit 6 in the Study scheme)  prior to treatment . This will permit 
computing the slope from a linear regression pre - and post -treatment to get a rate of decline in 
ALSFRS -R per month pre -treatm ent and post - treatment .  
No to minimal differences are expected between the mITT and ITT population s, however if 
there are differences, analysis of the primary endpoint and other select efficacy analyses will 
also be generated using the mITT population.  
The ITT and mITT population will be analyzed based upon the treatment groups subjects are 
randomized to.  
Supporting efficacy analyses will be conducted using the Efficacy Evaluable (EE) population 
which will be a subset of the mITT population. The exact criteria used to define the EE 
population will be finalized prior to locking the database and unblinding th e study.  
Each statistical test will be performed at Type I error α=0.05 (Two -sided). The primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially to account for multiplicity and preserve 
overall Type I error. No adjustments will be made for  multiple comparisons in testing additional 
secondary exploratory efficacy endpoints.  
A subject is defined as a responder if his/her rate of disease progression as  measured by the 
ALSFRS -R slope (rate of decline per month fit using linear regression) over 28 weeks from 
baseline improves by ≥ 1.25 points/month  as compared to the disease progression over the pre -
 
 Confidential  Page 11  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 11 of 66 
treatment period. All deaths related to disease progression will be defined as non -responders. 
Baseline will be the first transplantation visit (Week 0, V isit 6 in the Study scheme) .  
The null and alternative hypothesis are as follows:  
Ho: Pt=Pp 
Ha: Pt≠Pp 
Where H o and H a are the null and alternative hypothesis respectively and P t and P p are the 
proportion of participants  in the treated group and placebo group whose post -treatment slope 
over 2 8 weeks from baseline as compared to the pre -treatment slope in the overall ALSFRS -R 
score improves by ≥ 1.25 points/month .  
The hypothesis testing to compare the percentage of responders between the two treatment 
groups will be based upon the ITT population, using logistic regression  adjusting for site, and 
ALSFRS -R slope pre -treatment . Other explanatory variables may be added to the logistic 
regression model which will be finalized and described in the SAP prior to locking the database 
and unblinding the study.  
The two key secondary endpoint s to be tested if the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint is 
rejec ted are a compari son between the  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  and placebo group of the 
(a) percentage of participants  whose post -treatment slope in the overall ALSFRS -R score as 
compared to their pre -treatment slope improves by ≥ 100%  (b) change in ALSFRS -R score  
from baseline to week 28 . These two secondary endpoints will be tested in this order to preserve 
Type I error.  
Additional supportive endpoints will include comparison between treatment groups of (a) 
survival or time to tracheostomy; (b) mean change in  slope of ALSFRS -R score over each post 
baseline visit and the entire follow -up period (2 – 28 weeks) as compared to  pre-treatment slope 
and (c) the change from baseline in ALSFRS -R score to each post baseline time point s.  
Two sensitivity analyses will be performed using multiple imputations with unobserved data 
imputed prior to fitting the linear regression. In both s ensitivity analyses, the method of multiple 
imputations (MI) using Pattern Mixture Model  (Little, 1996) will be used. An ALSFRS -R 
overall score will be considered to be non -missing if at least 6 out of the 12 items were assessed 
and have valid scores. Base d upon prior trial s the amount of non -monotone missing data are 
expec ted to be minimal and hence any  non-monotone missing ALSFRS -R overall scores will 
be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte -Carlo method.   
In the first sensitivity analysis, an assumption o f Missing at Random (MAR) will be made and 
subject’s missing data will be imputed using those with available data within th e treatment 
group  they were randomized to . In the second sensitivity analysis, an assumption of Missing 
Not at Random (MNAR ) will be used w here missing data for all participants  will be  imputed 
using available data for Placebo participants .  
The analysis for ALSFRS -R subscales will employ a similar approach as described fo r the 
primary and secondary efficacy analyses . 
Analysis of change in SVC will be detailed in the SAP.  
Details of all statistical analyses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan which will be 
finalized prior to database lock and unblinding the study.  
Safety  All safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety Population, which will be defined as all 
participants  who were randomized and had at least one treatment performed.  
When evaluating changes in safety parameters, Baseline will be defined as the last measu rement 
prior to the first treatment.  
For physical examination, concomitant medications, hematology and blood chemistry, ECG 
assessments, shifts from baseline in categorization of results (e.g. normal/abnormal or 
above/below normal range) will also be summa rized.  
All continuous data obtained in this study and documented in the electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) will be listed and tabulated with descriptive group statistics (n, mean, standard

  deviation, median, minimum, maximum). For discrete data, counts and percentages will be 
summarized.  
Biomarkers  CSF and/or serum or blood samples will be analyzed for the concentration of biomarkers and 
their relationship to efficacy outcomes. In addition, relationships between neurotropic factors, 
inflammatory markers  and clinical outcomes will be evaluated to determine if any biomarkers 
can be predictive to treatment outcome or pro gnostic to disease progression.

1. CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
1.1 INTRODUCTION  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and relentlessly progressive 
neurodegenerative disease. There is currently no available treatment that has been shown to 
stop or reverse its progression. There remains an unmet medi cal need for safe and effective 
treatments for people with ALS.  
Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult 
neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of multiple 
NTFs to the  immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve 
their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms. NTF -secreting 
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC -NTF cells) are a novel cell -therapeutic approach a imed at 
effectively delivering NTFs directly to the site of damage in ALS patients.  
The NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) therapy is based on transplantation of autologous bone 
marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which are enriched from the patient’s own  
bone marrow, propagated ex vivo and induced to secrete NTFs such as Glial Derived Growth 
Factor (GDNF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Vascular Endothelial Growth 
Factor (VEGF) and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). The autologous NurOwn® (MSC -NTF 
cells)  are back -transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and/or 
the muscles, where axon terminals are expected to take up the neurotrophic factors secreted by 
the transplanted cells.  
The NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) has b een evaluated in two open label clinical studies and 
several compassionate treated patients.  
The first two open label studies, carried out at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel 
(Study Registry ID: [REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), as  well as the 8 
compassionate treatments, confirmed the treatment was safe and well tolerated either by the IT 
or by the IM route of administration as well as by the combined IT and IM administration, and 
showed some initial indications of efficacy, slowing  the slope of disease progression.  
The Phase 1/2 first -in-man study evaluat ed the safety of a single initial dose of NurOwn® 
(MSC -NTF cell) administered by two different routes. NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) were 
administered intramuscularly (IM) in a cohort of 6 early stage ALS patients (ALSFRS -R score 
≥25) and intrathecally (IT) in 6 ALS patients with more progressive disease (ALSFRS -R score 
15-30) and insufficient muscle bulk. The 6 patients with early stage ALS received 24 IM 
injections of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF ce lls) (~1 x 106 cells/site into 24 sites along the biceps and 
triceps muscles of one arm for a total of ~24x106 cells/patient), and the 6 patients with more 
progressive disease received NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  by IT administration (one dose of 1 x 
106 NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) /kg of body weight). This study established the safety of 
NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  administration via IT and IM at these IM and IT doses.  
The f irst Phase 2 trial was a dose -escalating study i n three cohorts of 4 early -stage ALS patients 
(ALSFRS -R score ≥ 30) aimed at evaluating safety and collecting efficacy data of the combined 
IT and IM administration. The three patient cohorts received the initial Phase 1/2 dose, a 1.5 
fold, and a 2 -fold dos e respectively by combined IT and IM administration. This study 
 
 Confidential  Page 18  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 18 of 66 
established the higher doses to be safe and showed early signs of change in slope in the 
ALSFRS -R post -treatment compared to the slope pre -treatment.  
In both these studies, patients were foll owed for 3 months before and 6 months after 
transplantation. Additional outcome measures in these studies included change in: muscle 
strength grading ( maximal voluntary isometric contraction [ MVIC]) by grip, forced vital 
capacity (FVC %), muscle bulk estim ated by magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) of the upper 
extremities, upper and lower extremities circumference, electromyography (EMG) parameters. 
Results from the above studies were published in JAMA Neurology ( Petrou et al 2016 ). 
The second Phase 2a trial was a multicenter study conducted in U.S in 48 patients  with early 
ALS to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) administered as single 
dose through a combination of IT and IM routes at a dose of 100 x 106 to 125 x 106 cells 
compared t o placebo. The safety profile of the single dose of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cell s) was 
well tolerated with majority of AEs being mild or moderate. Significant improvement was 
observed in the total ALSFRS -R scores based upon per cent improvement in slope, 
post-transplantation compared to pre -transplantation through the 24 -week follow -up period .  
The purpose of th e proposed  BCT -002 Phase 3  study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
three successive administrations of intrathecal injections of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) as 
compared to placebo given every two mon ths to participants  with ALS  (ALSFRS -R ≥ 25 at the 
Screening Visit). The primar y and some secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed base d 
upon improvement in ALSFRS -R scores . Blood and CSF samples  will be collected for 
biomarker analyses  and DNA will be collected to identify specific ALS mutations  and ALS 
related genes that may r eveal important prognostic variables in post hoc analyses (Van den 
Berg,  et al 2019) . 
1.1.1.  COVID -19 Pandemic  
This study protocol is amended in consideration of the current outbreak of respiratory disease 
caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, 
and that has now been detected in many locations internationally, including cases in the United 
States. The virus has been named “SARSCoV -2” and the disease it causes has been named 
“Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID -
19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. In addition, on March 13, 2020, the 
President declared a national emergency in response to COVID -19 (FDA guidance  on Conduct 
of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Pandemic , March 2020 ). 
Brainstorm considers ensuring the safety and welfare of trial participants to be of paramount  
importance . This  amendment is aimed at considering each circumstance, focusing on the 
potential impact on the safety and welfare of trial participants, and stresses the importance to 
modify study conduct accordingly. The sponsor may determine that the protection of a 
participant’s safety, welfare, and rights is best served by continuing the study participant in the 
trial as per the protocol or by delaying or discontinuing the administration or use of the 
investigational product or even participation in the trial.

Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 19 of 66 
The need  to put new processes in place or to modify existing processes may vary in specific 
institutions and by geography depending on local public health initiatives . This assessment 
could include consideration of whether it is appropriate to delay some assessmen ts and/or to 
perform some assessments remotely by telephone or through the use of telemedicine 
technology .  Furthermore, specific assessments, such as SVC that may be viewed by institutions 
as “high risk” during the COVID -19 pandemic, may not be performed until such a time as 
institutional policies permit, to prevent viral contamination and reduce the risk to study 
participants , their caregivers,  and clinical trial staff.  
1.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
To determine efficacy and safety of repeat administrations of IT injections of NurOwn®, 
autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Secreting Neurotrophic Factors ( MSC -NTF)  as compared 
to Placebo given three times  two months apart to participants  with early ALS . 
1.2.1.  Primary objective s

ALSFRS -R at 28 weeks following the first treatment . 
• To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) vs. placebo as measured by 
improvements in ALSFRS -R score between baseline and 28 weeks following the first 
treatment.  
• To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) as compared to placebo as 
measured by improvements in ALSFRS -R slope using different responder definitions.  
• To evaluate the effi cacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) as compared to placebo by a 
comparison between treatment groups of (a) tracheostomy  free survival ; (b) change in 
slope of ALSFRS -R over each post baseline visit (2 – 28 weeks) as compared to pre -
treatment slope and (c) the c hange from baseline in the ALSFRS -R score to each post 
baseline time point.  
• To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) vs. placebo as measured by the 
change of SVC (% predicted) from baseline to 28 weeks following the first treatment.  
• To evaluate  biomarkers ( NTF s, inflammatory factors  and cytokines) in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before each treatment and at select time points  as well as in

with NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) .  
• To study whether response to NurOwn® treatment  correlates with specific ALS genetic 
mutations or gene variants related to ALS  
1.3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
1.3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan   
This is the fo urth clinical study conducted  by Brainstorm  Cell Therapeutics to study  autologous 
NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  and the second study under this Investigational New Drug (IND)  
conducted in the U.S . This is a Phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study that 
will be conducted in approximately 200 participants  with AL SFRS -R scores  ≥ 25  at the 
Screening Visit  at multiple study sites . After providing informed consent and signing a wr itten 
informed consent d ocument a ll participants  will be observed for a total of approximately 12 
weeks  prior to randomization and bone marrow aspiration to establish each individual’s rate of 
progression of ALS for comparison against t he post -treatment measures (see  Figure 1). 
Participants  will be randomized at  a 1:1 ratio to receive NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) or placebo 
(week -5). At Visit 5  (week -4), the participa nts’ bone -marrow will be harvested and MSC  from 
participants  in the treatment group will be isolated, expanded and cryopreserved. Prior to each 
treatment cells will be thawed, cultured and induced to differentiate into MSC -NTF cells.  A 
dose of  ~125 x 106 MSC -NTF cells will be admi nistered at each treatment . At the time of 
consent , participants  will be informed that they may  not receive the transplant in case their 
autologous bone marrow fails to grow and reach the adequate numbers of MSC and/or MSC -
NTF cel ls. 
Participants  will undergo three IT transplantations with NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  or 
matching placebo  approximately every 8 weeks  (Figure 2). The first transplantation will be at 
Visit 6 (Week 0) approximately 16  weeks after screening, with the subsequent transplantations 
at V isit 9 (Week  8) and V isit 11 (Week 16). Throughout the study, participants  will be 
monitored by evaluators blinded to the  treatment allocation group . Assessments and procedures 
that will be performed during the study are  provided in Table 1 and Table 2. Following the third 
and last treatment participants  will be followed for  three  additional monthly visits  (through 
week 28)  during which the ALSFRS -R score will be obtained, along with vit al signs, laboratory 
tests and recording of concomitant medications and AEs (see schedule of assessments  (SOA) 
in Table 1). 
In consideration of contingency measures implemented due to the outbreak of the COVID -19 
pandemic, to minimize or eliminate immediate hazards or to protect the life and well -being of 
research participants (e.g., to limit exposure to C OVID -19) specific study visits and 
assessments may be rescheduled and/or conducted remotely according to the institutional 
differences at the individual clinical sites.  
The autologous produ ction process is on a per -subjec t basis and begins upon fresh bone marrow 
aspirate arrival to the cleanroom facility and is completed once the cells are ready for 
transplantation.

Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 21 of 66 
1.3.2 Study Schematic  
The study comprises an up to  20-week pre-treatment  period including an approximately up to 
12 weeks screening  period , a 16-week treatment period , during which three transplantations  will 
be performed  followed by a  12-week pos t-treatment follow -up period  (Figure 1).  
Participants ' bone marrow will be aspirated up to approximately  15 weeks following the first 
screening visit. The MSC isolation and cell propagation process es will last about 4-5 weeks and 
will be followed by NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  transplantation.   
At each  transplant ation visit s [up to about 20 weeks after the screening visit , up to 28 weeks 
after the screening visit ( 8 weeks after first transplantation ) and up to 36 weeks after the 
screening visit ( 8 weeks after second transplantation )], participants  will be admitted to an 
inpatient study unit for study proce dures and will be followed for 2 4-72 hours post 
transplantation.  In consideration of the COVID -19 pandemic , patients may be released from  the 
inpatient units after observation for less than 24 hou rs, per Principal Investigator’s judgment  of 
their clinical status, as the risk of prolonged stay in the hospital may outweigh the potential 
benefit .  
Following each treatment , participants  will be assessed at visits  described in Table 1. After 
receiving the thi rd treatment  dose (at Week 16  weeks after the first transplantation ), all 
participants  will be followed for 12 weeks  for evaluation of key efficacy and safety assessments.  
Each participant  will thus be followed for a total of up to about 48 weeks ( ~12 months) from the 
first visit ( Figure 1).

1.3.3 Treatment Plan  
1.3.3.1.  Bone Marrow aspiration procedure  
Human bone marrow will be aspirated by a credentialed health care provider as per Medical 
Centre standard procedures, bilaterally from multiple punctures of the iliac crest of the pelvic 
bone of participants  into 20 mL syringes prefilled with approximately  1 mL of a Heparin -
containing solution (Heparin Solution, USP, 350 units/mL) in PlasmaLyte . A Transfer Pack 
container with Male Luer – 600 mL bag ( Fenwal Item no. 4R2024 ) or equivalent, containing 
Heparin will be pre -labelled. The bone marrow aspirated fro m each single puncture ( ~5 ml), 
will be injected into the bag through the male Luer. Immediately after bone marrow from each 
syringe is injected into the bag, the bag will be thoroughly mixed twice to avoid clotting of the 
bone marrow sample.  
A total of 80 to 100 mL of bone marrow will be aspirated from each participant .  
1.3.3.2.  Intrathecal  Transplant Procedure  
Participants  will undergo a lumbar puncture  (Spinal needle 20GA 3.50 IN (0.9 x 90 mm) ) 
followed by IT injection of cells or placebo (Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM ; 
Figure 2). IT injection is to be performed by an unblinded site team /physician that will not have 
further contact with the study participants  or with the investigator and blinded site staff.  The 
detailed transplantation pro cedure is provided in Appendix 5 .  
Participa nts will be eligible for their 2nd and 3rd treatments  if, in the judgment of the study team, 
there are no medical contraindications to proceeding.

Diagram delineating placebo and cells transplantation in the treatment and placebo groups.   
1.3.4 Blinding and Randomization  
Randomization will  be used to avoid bias in the assignment of participants  to treatment, to 
increase the likelihood that known and unknown attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline 
characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of

This is a double -blind study  where the investigators, participants  and all sponsor and CRO 
personnel involved in the conduct, dat a management or analysis of the study will remain 
blinded to the treatment assignments. The exceptions to th is blinding are the physician who 
administers the IT injection of MSC -NTF cells, the unblinded statistician who will create the 
final randomization schedule but will not otherwise be involved in the trial, the  personnel at the 
vendor responsible for configuration  of the IXRS  (Interactive Voice/Web Response System 
(IVRS/IWRS  or IXRS ) system  and the  Manufacturing team (unblinded personnel) at the cell 
culture facility who will distribute the NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) . Each of these groups will 
have standard operating procedures in place for maintaining the treatment blind.   
The Production manager will access the IXRS system for randomization information when 
assigning treatment to a participant  and will allocate the treatment corresponding to the 
participants ' randomization number.  Randomization will occur at Visit 4  (one week prior to  
Bone Marrow aspiration) after  the eligibility has been con firmed.  The participant' s 
randomization number will be obtained by  the cell culture facility and recorded in the 
participant' s batch record in preparation for MSC isolation and cell propagation process.  
The randomization code may be broken only in the eve nt of an emergency , when it is essential 
to know which treatment the participant  received in order to provide appropriate care. If 
unblinding becomes necessary, the investigator will discuss the reason for unblinding with the 
medical monitor prior to unblinding , and the medical monitor will provide the identification of 
the treatment if there is agreement that unblinding is necessary.  Whenever the code is broken 
for safety reasons, the IXRS system will record the date, time, and reason for unblinding . The 
Sponsor and responsible CRO will be  notified immediately  of such unblinding without 
revealing details of the treatment of the participants .  
To minimize bias, all efforts will be made to minimize participants  discontinuing the study 
between randomizati on (Visit 4) and treatment (Visit 6). For any Participant  that discontinue 
during this period the reasons for discontinuation will be recorded.  
1.3.5 Duration of study  
Participants  will be screened and  then eligible participants  will undergo bone marrow aspira tion 
after up to 14 weeks.  Following aspiration, MSC will be isolated, propagated for about  2 weeks  
and cryopreserved . About 2 weeks prior to each treatment, MSC will be thawed, propagated 
and induced into MSC -NTF cells. Participants  in both the treatment and placebo groups will 
undergo IT cell transplantation with either NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  or the placebo (DMEM)  
on Day  0 (Visit 6) , Week 8  (Visit 9)  and Week 16  (Visit 11) . Following each cell 
transplantation, participants  will be monitored as inpat ients for a period of approximately  24 
hours. Participants  will be discharged after approximately 24 hours and up to 72 hours unless a 
clinical AE(s) occur s and require s continued inpatient monitoring and/or treatment.  After  the 
last dose , participants  will be followed for  approximately 12 weeks for efficacy and safety 
assessment . Each subject ’s participation in the stu dy will last for approximately 48 weeks .  
1.3.6 Discussion of Dose   
The IT transplantation dose (~125 x106 cells) is the highest dose of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  
that has been  safely administered in the previous clinical trials in early ALS participants .

1.3.7 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group  
ALS is a fatal, progressive, neurodegenerative disea se characterized by motorneuron cell death 
in the brain and spinal cord, accompanied by rapid loss of muscle control and eventual complete 
paralysis. There is currently no available treatment to prevent its progressive course , and life 
expectancy of patien ts is usually 3 to 5 years after diagnosis .  
The current study is a 1:1 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled multicenter study. The 
control group will be given placebo. It is expected that approximately 100 participants  each in 
the NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) and placebo arm will provide an adequate number of 
participants  demonstrate a higher propo rtion of participants  in the MSC -NTF  group responding 
to treatment compared to Placebo.  
1.4 PATIENT  POPULATION  
This study will be conducted in participants  with a clinical diagnosis of ALS who meet the El 
Escorial criteria ( Brooks B R et al 2000 ) for possible, laboratory -supported probable, probable, 
or definite ALS. To be enrolled in this study, participants  must meet al l inclusion criteria in 
Section  1.4.1  below and must not have any of the exclu sion criteria listed in Section  1.4.2 .  
The participants'  population is chosen from the group of  early stage ALS participants  with the 
aim of obtaining a homogeneous study population that will facilitate the interpretation of the 
study results and also allow for identifying trends in efficacy outcomes.

1.5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The SOA provides a visual listing of study assessments  at each visit.  
The st udy assessments at each visit are  provided in Table 1 in Appendix  1. The timing of the 
key study visits , Randomization (V4),  BMA (V5), T1 (V6), T2 (V9) and T3 (V11)  that are 
driven by manufacturing availability , may require a  more flexible window to align with  the 
manufacturing slot  allocated to the individual pa rticipant .   
The study manual with details of asse ssments  are provided in Appendix 2 (ALSFRS -R) 
Appendix 3 (SVC ) and Appendix 4 ( C-SSRS ).  
This is a multicenter study. Th e Sponsor will ensure that all m edical centers will be performing 
study assessment procedures in the same way by providing appropriate training to sites.   
Any evaluator  performing ALSFRS -R assessments will be trained and certified. ALSFRS -R 
assessments will be done in person at in-clinic visits . If an ALSFRS -R cannot be provided  in-
person it will be administered via the telephone. The ALSFRS -R has been validated for 
administration o ver the phone  (Kasarski EJ et al 2005, Mannino M et al 2007 ). 
1.5.1.  Anticoagulation  therapy  
Anticoagulation treatment increases the risk of bleeding -related complications associated with 
any invasive procedure.    
In this study, this may impact the bone marrow aspiration at Visit 5, three stem cell transplants 
by lumbar puncture at visits 6, 9 and 11, and other lumbar punctures to collect CSF at visits 7, 
8, 10 and 12 (a total of 7 lumbar punctures).  
Due to the ris k involved in performing a lumbar puncture while on anticoagulation  therapy  it 
would be medically necessary to withhold anticoagulation prior to and immediately after any 
of these procedures. There are several variables that would determine individual pati ent risk of 
withholding anticoagulation prior to the procedure, including: the indication for the 
anticoagulation and the type of anticoagulation  therapy . Consequently, the risk for study 
participants must be considered by the study investigator  on an indi vidual, case -by-case basis , 
 
 Confidential  Page 27  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 27 of 66 
and a risk benefit assessment should be conducted, evaluating the risks of discontinuing 
anticoagulation with the potential benefits of participating in the clinical trial  for each subject .  
1.5.2.  CSF and Blood collection for assessme nts of Biomarkers  
The CSF and blood samples will be collected for  the detection of biomarkers at visits described 
in Table 1. 
1.5.3.  Genetic Analyses  
Bone ma rrow derived mononuclear cells or MSC of study participants derived from the Bone 
Marrow aspirated at Visit 5, will be collected for DNA isolation and genetic profiling of ALS 
related genes to assess whether response to NurOwn® treatment correlates  with specific ALS 
genetic mutations or gene variants .  Patients that have already completed or discontinued the 
study will be reconsented and asked to provide buccal swabs for DNA analysis . They will not 
be required to return to the clinic to pr ovide the sample.  
1.5.4.  Clinical Laboratory Safety Tests  
Clinical laboratory safety tests will be monitored th roughout the trial at Visits 1 , 4, 6, 9, 11, 13 
and 14 as list ed in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 and Table 2).

Every reasonable effort will be made to cont act any subject  apparently lost to follow -up during 
the course of the study to complete study -related assessments and record outstanding data.  If a 
participant cannot be reached, the site should document that at least 3 reasonable attempts were 
made to con tact the participant over a period of 30 days from the time the site last had contact 
with the participant.  Following 3 telephone contact attempts, the subject  will be contacted by 
mail using a method that provides proof of receipt.  Alternate contacts wil l be used if the subject  
is not reachable ( e.g., primary care providers, referring physician, relatives).   
Such efforts shall  be documented in the subject ’s source documents.   
If all efforts fail to establish contact, the subject  will be considered lost to follow -up.

1.6. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT INFORMATION  
1.6.1.  General Information  
The cell therapy (NurOwn®) is based on the autologous transplantation of a dult bone marrow 
derived human mesenchymal  stem cells ( hMSC ) that are induced ex-vivo, using a medium 
based procedure, to secrete NTF s such as GDNF, BDNF, VEGF  and HGF and are thus 
designated MSC -NTF cells .  
MSC -NTF cells are adult stem cells that are used for autologous “Self -transplantation”. There 
is no ethical or safety issues of invo lvement of embryonic cells. Since the cells are the subject 's 
own cells there is no risk of rejection and no need for immunosuppressive agents, which can 
cause severe and/or long -term side effects.   
NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  delivery is easy and safe by stan dard procedures (IT injections) 
and does not require surgical intervention.  
1.6.2.  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Product Characteristics  
Participants ’ bone marrow will be aspirated and MSC cells will be  isolated from the total bone 
marrow mononuclear cell population, propagated in culture and induced to secrete NTFs. The 
NurOwn® propagated MSC -NTF cells  will then be transplanted back into the subject  as 
following:   
• ~125 x106 cells by IT administration (h owever, if less than 125 x 106 cells are available, 
then the total available dose of cells shall  be administered, provided at least 100  x 106 
cells are administered).  
The NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  production process will be carried out in the absence o f 
antibiotics, phenol red , and animal derived components.  The production process will be cGMP 
compliant and will be  performed under full environmental control, in a class 10,000 cleanroom 
(ISO 7). All cell manipulation procedures are performed in a class 100 (I SO 5) Biosafety 
cabinet .  
NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  will be  provided in a ready -to-use subject -personalized unique 
treatment package with the appropriate primary and secondary labels. The treatment package 
consists of one 5 mL syringe for IT transplantation  containing freshly harvested autologous 
cultured NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  at the dose defined  in this protocol  (see section 1.6.4) .  
Syringes will be capped with a stopper (not a needle). The 5 mL syringe for IT transplantation 
will be packed in a pouch.   
The treatment/placeb o package will be  delivered to the clinical site in a shipping system 
container designed for maintaining a temperature of 2 -8°C during shipment. The shipping 
system containing the syringes will be  shipped to the clinical site. The p roduct shall  be 
administered to the subject  within the established shelf life of the product .  
Placebo will be provided in the same volume and syringes size as the cell  containing syringes.

The sponsor will make every effort to ensure blinding of the study by assigning a different team 
(preferably from a different department) to the transplantation p rocedures that will not be 
otherwise involved in evaluation of the participants  through the course of the study.   
The cell production process, including the in -process controls is described in full detail in the 
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ( CMC ) section and in the Investigator's brochure (IB).   
1.6.3.  Treatment Compliance  
Since participants  are recruited with onset of disease symptoms within 24 months , and 
ALSFRS -R ≥ 25 and ≥ 65% SVC at the screening  Visit , they are expected t o be able to  complete 
the three  transplantations .  
To increase chances of post -treatment compliance, effort s will be made to recruit participants  
living in the geographical proximity of the medical centers or previously known to the 
Investigators.   
1.6.4.  Test product, Dose and Administration  
Placebo or NurOwn®  (MSC -NTF cells)  at a dose of  125 x 106 cells will be administered 
intrathecally  (however, if less than 125 x 106 cells are available, then the total available dose of 
cells shall  be administered, provide d at least 100 x 106 cells are administered).   
1.7. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
1.7.1.  Prior Therapy  
Participants  who received prior cell therapy of any kind will be excluded from the study ( see 
Section 1.4.2 ).  
Rilutek (riluzole) , Nuedexta (dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate) , and 
Radicava or Radicut (edaravone)  are the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA )-approved 
drugs for participants  with ALS (Nuedexta is approved only to treat pseudobulbar affect that 
occurs in some participants  with ALS). Study participants  must be on a stable dose of riluzole 
for at least 30 days pri or to screening, or not on riluzole at all with no plans to begin therapy 
with riluzole for the duration of the study.  Participants  may not have taken Edaravone within 
30 days of screening and must not plan to begin therapy with edaravone for the duration of the 
study . Study participants who begin an excluded medication during the study period will be 
discontinued from treatment. In order to minimize the amount and impact of missing data, study 
investigators will make all reasonable efforts to collect key e fficacy and safety data on 
participants who discontinue treatment or discontinue from the study .  
All medications taken prior to the first transplantation will be recorded as Prior medications.  
1.7.2.  Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications are those given to the subject  during or after the first transplant ation . 
All concomitant medications will be recorded.  
 
 Confidential  Page 39  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 39 of 66 
Participants  who were on a stable dose of riluzole for at least 30 days prior to screening will 
continue taking riluzole prior to study enrolment, unless requiring discontinuation during the 
study for standard side -effects.   
In addition, the use of non -invasive procedures including continuous positive airway pressure 
and diaphragmatic pacing systems will be recorded.  
1.8. SAFETY REPORTING  
For this study, AEs and SAEs will be collected from the screening visit through the end of the 
study period as detailed in Section 1.8.1 .  
1.8.1.  Adverse Events definitions and reporting  
Standard definitions for AEs are provided in this section for informational purposes.  
1.8.1.1.  Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a dr ug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  
Within t his investigation, adverse events also encompass procedurally related observations 
based upon physical examination of the patient, or laboratory assessments or spontaneously 
reported by the subject which are temporally associated with the administration of  study 
medication.  
For adverse events requiring medical interventions such as surgeries, diagnostic procedures and 
therapeutic procedures it is recommended that these be recorded as treatment of the adverse 
event or action taken rather than an additional a dverse event  
1.8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (a n AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ life-threatening ” 
if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject  or 
subject  at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, mi ght have caused death )  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization  excluding:  
▪ A visit to the emer gency room or other hospital department for <24 hours that 
does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical event or 
life-threatening)  
▪ An elective surgery planned prior to signing informed consent  
 
 Confidential  Page 40  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 40 of 66 
▪ Protocol specified admissions for planned procedures  
▪ Admission for social circumstance that has no bearing on health status and 
requires no intervention (e.g., economic inadequacy, family circu mstances, 
administrative  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or req uire 
hospitalization may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
If it is not certain that an event meets the above definitions of an SAE, the site investigators will 
contact the Medical Monito r to discuss.  
SAEs reported through 12 weeks following the last transplantation will be entered  in the study 
safety database and reported as such . 
1.8.1.3.  Relatedness (Causality)  
Investigators will assess relatedness of AEs to study drug using the following term s:  
• Definite : An AE that has a clear temporal association with investigational product 
administration (e.g., within 72 hours); provides a plausible pharmaco logic explanation 
for the event  
• Probable: There is a reasonable temporal association with administra tion of the 
investigational product; unlikely caused by other  drugs or underlying conditions  
• Possible : There is a plausible temporal association with the investigational product, but 
other etiologies are possible and relatedness to the investigational prod uct cannot 
definitely be ruled out  
• Unlikely:  The temporal association with the investigational product is implausible (but 
not impossible). The event is likely relate d to other drugs or conditions  
• Not Related : An AE with no temporal association with the investigational product but 
rather related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or conditions or 
subject 's known clinical state; subject  has not received investigational product.   
1.8.1.4.  Severity (Inten sity)  
The severity of an AE will be graded on a scale: mild, moderate, severe, as defined below:   
• Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations on ly; 
intervention not indicated  
 
 Confidential  Page 41  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 41 of 66 
• Moderate : Minimal, local or non -invasive interventi on indicated; interferes with age -
appropri ate activities  of daily living  
• Severe : Disabling; unable to carry out age -appropri ate activities of daily living  
• Potentially Life -Threatening : Medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent 
permanent impair ment, persistent disability, or death.  
1.8.1.5.  Follow -Up of AEs   
After the initial recording of an AE, the Investigator shall  proactively follow the subject . Any 
non-serious AEs that are still on -going at the end of the study shall  be reviewed to determine if 
further follow -up is required.  The Investigator will document on the eCRF any/all on -going 
non-serious AEs that will not be followed further after the subject exits the study.  If in doubt, 
the Investigator shall  consult the study Medical Monitor.   
All SAEs shall  be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until the subject  is 
lost to follow -up, or otherwise explained.  Once the SAE is re solved, the corresponding AE 
eCRF page shall  be updated.  Additionally, any relevant laboratory test reports, consultation 
reports from other health care professionals, discharge summaries, or other information that has 
been gathered about the event shall  be transmitted to the Sponsor.   
The Sponsor may request that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature 
and/or causality of any AE.   
1.8.1.6.  Outcome  
The following terms will be used during this study:  
• Fatal  
• Not Recovered/ not resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Unknown  
1.8.1.7.  Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities  
Any laboratory abnormalities deeme d clinically signif icant by the Investigator shall  be reported 
on the AE eCRF. A clinically significant abnormality is a confirmed abnormality (by repeat 
test) tha t is changed sufficiently from s creening visit so that in the judgment of the Investigator 
a change in management is warranted. This alteration may include: monitoring the laboratory 
test further, initiating other diagnostic tests or procedures, changing ongoing treatment, or 
administering new treatment. Whenever possible, the etiology of the abno rmal finding (e.g., 
anemia) will be recorded on the eCRF. Repeated additional tests and/or other evaluations 
 
 Confidential  Page 42  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 42 of 66 
required to establish the significance and etiology of an abnormal result shall  be obtained when 
clinically indicated.  
1.8.2.  Reporting Responsibilities and Procedures for AEs and SAEs  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator or Sub -Investigator(s) to perform periodic assessment 
of all AEs/SAEs.  
A subject , who experiences an AE, whethe r serious or non-serious , shall  receive appropriate 
treatment and medical supervision as clinically indicated. AEs/SAEs will be followed 
throughout the subject ’s participation in the study, until resolution/stabilization or until a time 
that is mutually agreed upon between the Medical Monitor and the Investigator.  
The I nvestigator must report to the Sponsor all SAEs on the eCRF within 24 hours of learning 
about the event  regardless of relationship to study drug .  
If the site experiences a temporary disruption of the eCRF system , a back -up paper SAE 
Report Form will be available for site staff to complete.  
• Site staff will complete the paper SAE report form and e -mail it within 24 hours to the 
following address: drugsafety@worldwide.com  
• In cases where the email system is unavailabl e, site staff will send the SAE by fax to: 
+1-866-387-5539 (US).  
If notification is made via email or fax, site staff must enter t he SAE information into the 
eCRF  system as soon as the system becomes available.  Should a back -up SAE form be used, 
the original SAE form should be kept at the study site . 
If the SAE has not resolved at the time the Investigator submits an initial SAE report, the 
Investigator must provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon receipt of 
significant infor mation if the event is still ongoing). Additional follow -up information must be 
reported in the eCRF  within 24 hours of awareness following Investigator (or site) awareness 
of the information.  However, the Investigator should  not delay reporting a n SAE in order to 
obtain additional information . Additional information, when available , should be reported per 
the reporting procedures described above.  
The following information and assessments will be recorded in the eCRF:  
• The date and time of onset of the even t and when it ended using the 24-hour clock where 
midnight is 00:00 and noon is 12:00.  
• The signs, symptoms, or diagnosis of the event.  
• The AE severity using the criteria outlined above.  
• The relationship of the event to the investigational product as out lined above.  
• The seriousness of the event according to definitions outlined above.  
• A description of any required therapy, medication, treatment, or diagnostic procedure.  
• Clinical data prior to the event, such as nutrition, concomitant medications, physi cal 
activity, etc.

Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 43 of 66 
• Any additional data which might be relevant to the event.   
A written report is also required for all participants  who died during the study. This report must 
document the events surrounding the subject ’s death and the cause of death.  Attach a copy or 
summary of autopsy findings, if performed.  
All SAE reports and questions pertaining to an SAE shall  be directed to  responsible personnel’s

The Sponsor or designated CRO (Worldwide Clinical Trials) will r eport IND Safety Reports to 
the FDA and Investigators in accordance with the FDA regulations detailed in the Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) 21CFR312.32 and in accordance with Guidance for Industry and 
Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and bioavailability 
(BA)/bioequivalence ( BE) Studies, December 2012. The Investigator at each study site is 
responsible for reporting SAEs to his or her Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance 
with local IRB procedures.  
If new sites are added to the st udy, the Sponsor or designated CRO will notify all investigators 
at the sites involved in the study in writi ng of any severe/serious or unexpected AEs when this 
information is of global importance to subject  safety and welfare.  
1.8.3.  Reporting Respo nsibilities and Procedures for Pregnancies  
Pregnancy occurring in a female subject (and female partners of male subjects)  should be 
reported in the pregnancy eCRF w ithin 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. Pregnancy 
outcome information should be forwarded to Sponsor/Worldwide when available.  
 
 Confidential  Page 44  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 44 of 66 
Any pregnancies will be followed through delivery or premature termination.  If a female 
subject (or female partner of male subject) becomes pregnant during the study, any 
complications of that pregnancy such as abortion (spo ntaneous or induced), premature birth, or 
congenital abnormality will be captured as SAEs.  In the event the eCRF system is unavailable, 
a back -up paper Pregnancy Reporting Form will be available for site staff to complete follow ing 
the reporting gu ideline s as outlined in Section 1.8.2. 
Following delivery or termination of pregnancy, follow -up information regarding the outcome 
of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required.  
1.8.4.  Prospective assessment of the occurrence of suicidality  
There is no evidence from animal or previous human studies to suggest that NurOwn® (MSC -
NTF cells)  transplantation will increase suicidal ideation or attempts; but, because these cells 
are delivered to the CSF and are active in the central ner vous system, we plan to monitor 
suicidal ideation and behavior carefully during  the trial.   
Suicidal ideation and behavior will be monitored using the C -SSRS  
(http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu) , as per the SOA . All study staff delivering the C -SSRS will 
be fully trained in its appropriate use and only study staff prepared to appropriately respond to 
participants  exhibiting s uicidal ideation or behavior will deliver the scale. The ‘Baseline’ 
questionnaire will be given at the Screening/Visit.  The ‘Since Last Visit’ questionnaire will be 
given at subsequent visits  (See Appendix 4 ).  
1.8.5.  Study discontinuation    
1.8.5.1.  Study or Site Termina tion  
Conditions may arise during the study that could prompt the study to be halted or the study site 
to be terminated. Conditions that may prompt such considerations include, but are not limited 
to, the following:  
1. The discovery of unexpected, serious, or unac ceptable risk to the participants  enrolled 
in the study.  
2. A decision on the part of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to recommend 
suspend ing or discontinuing  the study.  
3. A decision on the part of Sponsor to suspend, discontinue, or shorten the study.  
4. Study conduct at the study site may warrant termination under conditions that include 
the following:  
a) Failure of Investigator(s) to enroll  eligible participants  into the stud y;  
b) Failure of Investigator(s) to comply with ICH -GCP guidelines, or FDA guidelines 
and regulations;  
c) Submission of false information from the research facility to the Sponsor, the 
Clinical Monitor, the FDA, or IRB;  
 
 Confidential  Page 45  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 45 of 66 
d) Insufficient adherence to protocol requ irements;  
e) A conflict of interest of the Investigator, his/her institution, or site personnel that 
would negatively impact the integrity of the clinical trial;  
f) Institution or IRB under investigation for cause by a regulatory agency.  
1.8.5.2.  Subject  Withdrawal fr om Study  
Participants  may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time during the course of the study  
for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice . The Investigator w ill document 
the reason/circumstances for withdrawal  in the appropr iate eCRF .  
Participants  can discontinue from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Participants  whose MSC or MSC -NTF cells fail to proliferate and to produce a sufficient 
number of cells for transplantation (See Section 1.3.1) 
• For any reason related  to safety or tolerability  
• At the subject’s request  
• At the discretion of the Investigator, if deemed appropriate for any reason  
• At the discretion of the Sponsor, if deemed appropriate for any reason  
Efforts will be made to follow all participants  who disco ntinue st udy for any reason  and 
enco urage participant to return to the site for an End of Study visit (Visit 14). Such follow -up 
will include all relevant evaluations for safety  and efficacy  including clinical assessments and 
collection of laboratory study resul ts as set out in this protocol.   
Efforts will be made to have participants who discontinue from the study for any reason, return 
to the site for an End of Study follow up visit.  Such follow -up will include all relevant 
evaluations for safety and efficacy including clinical assessments and collection of laboratory 
study results as set out in this protocol.   
If a participant refuses to return for any further  clinic visits, every eff ort will be made to follow 
the patient over the phone for the remaining study visits. This should be documented in the End 
of Study page eCRF in the electronic database  including the reason/circumstances for 
withdrawal in a timely manner (preferably within  24-48 hours).  The documentation should 
include the date the participant withdrew consent/discontinued, the reason for discontinuation, 
and the fact that the participant refuses to return for the end of study visit.  The date documented 
will be considered  the last date of contact and thus the participant’s last day on study.  Despite 
discontinuing from the study, if the site becomes aware of any adverse events or SAEs within 
12 weeks of the last transplant, they should be recorded in the database adverse ev ent log.  
1.8.5.3.  Temporary Discontinuation from the Study  
Study treatment can be temporarily withheld in case of any serious adverse event (SAE) or 
significant inter -current illness

The primary efficacy endpoint will be  to evaluate the proportion of NurOwn® treated 
participants  with a ≥1.25 point s/month improvement  in post -treatment slope vs. pre-treatment 
slope in ALSFRS -R score at 28 weeks following the first treatment  as compared to placebo .  
Efficacy assessments will be based upon the 12 item ALSFRS -R total score and its subscale 
scores  as described in Appendix 2 . ALSFRS -R scores should be collected in-person .  
Participants  who refuse clinic study visits (or temporarily unable to attend) will be contacted 
by phone call by the trained site personnel .  
The ALSFRS -R is a quickly administered (10 minutes) ordinal, validated rating scale (ratings 
0-4) used to determine participan ts' assessment of their capability and independence in 12 
functional activities.  All 12 activities are relevant in ALS.  Initial validity was established by 
documenting that in ALS patients, change in ALSFRS -R scores correlated with change in 
strength over time, as measured by quantitative neuromuscular strength testing, and with quality 
of life measures, and predicted survival ( Cedarbaum JM et al 1999 ). The test -retest reliability 
is greater than 0.88 for all test items.  The advantages of the ALSFRS -R are t hat the categories 
are relevant to ALS, it is a sensitive and reliable tool for assessing activities of daily living 
function in patients with ALS, and has been also  validated over the phone (Kasarski EJ et al 
2005, Mannino M et al 2007 ).  
1.9.1.2.  Safety  
Safety en dpoints include AEs, changes in physical and neurological examination findings, 
hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, and requirement of concomitant 
medications.  
1.9.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
1.9.2.1.  Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS -R)  
The first  secondary efficacy endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) 
vs. placebo as measured by the proportion of participants  whose disease progression is halted 
or improved as measured by a 100% or greater improvement in post -treatment slo pe vs. pre -
treatment slope in ALSFRS -R score at 28 weeks following the first treatment.  
The second secondary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) vs. 
placebo as measured by improvements in the ALSFRS R score between baseline and 28 weeks 
following the first treatment.  
In order to preserve Type I error, the above two secondary endpoints will be tested sequentially 
in the above order if the null hypothes is corresponding to the primary endpoint is rejected.  
Other efficacy endpoints will measure improvement in ALSFRS -R in participants  treated with 
NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  as compared to placebo  using different responder definitions

(percent change improvemen t in slope and point change improvement in slope) . Detailed 
definitions will be provided in statistical analysis plan ( SAP). 
To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) as compared to placebo by a 
comparison between treatment groups of (a) tracheos tomy free survival; (b) change in 
ALSFRS -R slope over each post baseline visit (2 – 28 weeks) as compared to pre -treatment 
slope and (c) the change from baseline in ALSFRS -R score to each post baseline time point . 
To evaluate the efficacy of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) vs. placebo as measured by the change 
in SVC (% predicted) from baseline to 28 weeks following the first treatment.  
1.9.2.2.  Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid  (CSF)  and Serum  or Blood 
CSF samples and serum or blood samples will be collected as per th e schedule of assessments  
to evaluate biomarkers (NTFs, inflammatory factors, and cytokines) in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) before each treatment and at select time points as well as in serum or blood samples (T 
regulatory cells) throughout the study, to  evaluate their relationship to treatment with NurOwn® 
(MSC -NTF cells) .  
1.9.3.  Statistical Methods and Sample Size Determination  
1.9.3.1.  Sample Size Determination  
Since the primary efficacy endpoint is based upon the percentage of responders who 
demonstrate a ≥ 1.25 poi nts/month improvement in ALSFRS -R post treatment slope as 
compared to their pre -treatment slope, the sample size for this study is based upon extrapolation 
of the percentage of participants  on NurOwn® (excluding slow progressors) who were 
responders at 12 weeks as observed in the previous Phase 2 BCT -001 US study.   
At 12 weeks post -treatment 53% of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) treated Participants  were 
observed to have an improvement in post -treatment slope using either the thresholds of ≥ 1.0 
Points / month or  ≥ 1.5 points / month.  
The best estimate of the percentage of placebo participants  who will be responders is based 
upon the % of responders at 24 weeks.  At 24 weeks post -treatment there were 17% of placebo 
participants  who were responders using ≥ 1.0 Poin ts / month and 0% using the threshold of ≥ 
1.5 points / month.  
Accounting for the longer duration of the study, missing data due to discontinuations and 
potentially fewer responders is in the NurOwn® treated group we estimate the true percentage 
of respond ers who improve ≥ 1.25 point/month on NurOwn® to be 35% and on Placebo to be 
15%. Utilizing a Chi -square test with Type I error rate of 0.05 two -sided and 90% power we 
would require 97 participants  per treatment arm.  
The true % of responders using the criteria of ≥ 100% improvement is also expected to be 
around 35% treated and 15 %  placebo .  
A sample size of approximately 100 participants  per arm ( approximately 200 participants  total) 
will be randomized.

1.9.3.2.  Statistical Me thods  
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum. Minima and maxima will be reported with the same 
precision as the raw values; means, standard deviations, and medians will be pre sented to one 
additional decimal place than reported in the raw values. Summaries for discrete variables will 
include frequencies and percentages. All percentages will be rounded to one decimal place (i.e., 
XX.X%). The baseline visit will be defined as the  last non -missing measure prior to initiation 
of investigational treatment  (first treatment at Visit 6, Day 0).  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to database lock, 
unblinding and analysis of study results.   
1.9.3.3.  Analysis Population  
The primary, secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT 
population which will be  defined as all subjects randomized.  
The modified intent to treat (mITT) population will be defined in this study as all participants  
who were randomized, treated and have at least three ALSFRS -R assessments: one pre -
treatment assessments of ALSFRS -R prior to the baseline assessment, a baseline assessment 
and one post -treatment assessment . Baseline will be the ALSFRS -R assessment at the first 
transp lantation visit (Week 0, Visit 6 ) prior to treatment . This will permit computing the slope 
from a  linear regression pre - and post -treatment to get a rate of change in ALSFRS -R per month 
pre-treatment and post -treatment.  
No to minimal differences are expected between the mITT and ITT population s, however if 
there are differences, analysis of the primary endpoint and other select efficacy analyses will 
also be generated using the mITT population.  
The ITT and mITT population s will be analyzed based upon the treatment groups subjects are 
randomized to.  
Supporting efficacy analyses will be conducted using the Efficacy Evaluable (EE) population 
which will be a subset of the mITT population. The exact criteria used to define the EE 
population will be finalized prior to locking the database and unblinding the study.  
All safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety Population, which will be defined as all 
participants  who were randomi zed and had at least one transplantation performed.   
1.9.3.4.  Efficacy Analyses  
Each statistical test will be performed at Type I error α=0.05 (Two -sided). The primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially to account for multiplicity and preserve 
overall Type I error. No adjustments will be made for multiple  comparisons in testing additional 
secondary exploratory efficacy endpoints.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is based upon the ALSFRS -R which is a validated scale based 
upon 12 items, each rated from 0 to 4. Scores of 4 are Normal and 0 are t he worst. Note t he 
 
 Confidential  Page 49  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 49 of 66 
ALSFRS -R score is between 0 and 48 . The slope is determined by fitting a linear regression 
using all assessments between the time points mentioned.  
A subject is defined as a responder if his/her  rate of disease progression as measured by the 
ALSFRS -R slope (rate of decline per month fit using linear regression) over 2 8 weeks from 
baseline  improves by ≥ 1.25 points/month  as compared to the disease progression over the pre -
treatment period. All deaths related to disease progression will be defined as non -responders.   
The null and alternative hypothesis are as follows:  
Ho: Pt=Pp 
Ha: Pt≠Pp 
Where H o and H a are the null and alternative hypothesis respectively and P t and P p are the 
proportion of participants  in the treated group and placebo group whose post -treatment slope 
over 28 weeks from baseline as compared to the pre -treatment slope in the overall ALSFRS -R 
score improves by ≥ 1.25 points/month .  
The hypothesis testing to compare the percentage of respon ders between the two treatment 
groups will be based upon the ITT population, using logistic regression adjusting for site, and 
ALSFRS -R slope pre -treatment.  Other explanatory variables may be added to the logistic 
regression model which will be finalized a nd described in the SAP prior to locking the database 
and unblinding the study . 
The first key secondary endpoint to be tested if the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint is 
rejected is a comparison between the NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  and placebo group of the 
percentage of participants  whose post -treatment slope in the overall ALSFRS -R score as 
compared to their pre -treatment slope improves by ≥  100%. Note, an improvement of 100% or 
more indicates achieving a post-treatment slope of ≥ 0, which means halt or improvement in 
disease progression as measured by the ALSFRS -R. 
If the null hypothesis for the first key secondary endpoint is rejected , the second key secondary 
endpoint will be the comparison in change from baseline to Week 28 in ALSFRS -R. 
Additional  supportive endpoints will include comparison between treatment groups of (a) 
survival or time to tracheostomy; (b) mean change in slope of ALSFRS -R score over each post 
baseline visit and the entire follow -up period (2 – 28 weeks)  as compared to pre -treatment slope 
and (c)  the change from baseline in ALSFRS -R score to each post baseline time point.  
Two sensitivity analyses will be pe rformed using multiple imputations with unobserved data 
imputed prior to fitting the linear regression. In both sensitivity analyse s, the method of multiple 
imputations (MI) ( Ratitch  et al 2013 ) using Pattern Mixture Model ( Little 1996 ) will be used . 
An AL SFRS -R overall score will be considered to be non -missing if at least 6 out of the 12 
items were assessed and have valid ALSFRS -R scores. Based upon prior trials the amount of 
non-monotone missing data are  expected to be minimal and hence any non -monotone missing 
ALSFRS -R scores will be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte -Carlo method . The COVID -
19 pandemic may result in additional missed visits resulting in a greater amount of non -
monotone or monotine missing data. As per ICH  E9, during blinded data revie w prior to 
database lock other imputations may be considered. These will be documented in an 
Amendment to the SAP prior to locking the database and unblinding the study. The method of 
 
 Confidential  Page 50  Brain storm Cell Therapeutics  
Phase 3  Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US  Amendment 2.1: March  2020  NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 50 of 66 
multiple imputations uses SAS PROC MI and MIANALYZE to generate multiple  complete 
datasets and combine the results from them.   
In the first sensitivity analysis, an assumption of Missing at Random (MAR) will be made and 
subject’s missing data will be imputed using those with available data within t he treatment 
group  they were  assigned to . In the second sensitivity analysis, an assumption of Missing Not 
at Random (MNAR)  will be made  based upon an approach similar to above using multiple 
imputations with missing data for subject imputed using the available data for Placebo 
participants .  
The analysis for ALSFRS -R subsc ales will employ a similar approach as described for the 
primary and secondary efficac y analyses.  
Details of all statistical analyses will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized prior to 
database lock a nd unblinding the study.  
1.9.3.5.  Safety analyses  
All s afety analyses will be analyzed in  the Safety P opulation .  
All AEs will be coded to System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number  of treatment -emergent adverse 
events ( TEAEs ) and the number of participants  with any TEAEs (along with percentages) will 
be tabulated by SOC and PT within each SOC by treatment group and over treatment groups. 
To count the number of participants  with any TEAEs, a subject  who experiences multiple 
TEAEs within the same SOC will be counted only once for that SOC (whether or not the TEAEs 
are coded to the same PT). A subject  who experiences multiple TEAEs coded to the same PT 
within the same SOC will  be counted only once for that particular PT. In the summary, SOC 
and PT’s  will be listed in descending alphabetical order.   
A TEAE is an AE that occurs for the first time after initiation of treatment or if had occurred 
prior to treatment, worsens in seve rity after initiation of treatment.  
Separate summaries will be provided for the following categories of AEs:   
• TEAEs   
• TEAEs by severity  
• Treatment -related TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs  
When evaluating  changes in safety parameters, B aseline will be defined as the last measurement 
prior to transplantation (i.e., prior to treatment).  
Physical examination, neurological examination, hematology, serum chemistry, vital signs and 
concomitant medications will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) if the data is continuous and using counts and 
percentages if the data is discrete. Shifts from baseline in categorization of results (e.g. 
normal/abnormal or low/normal /high) will also  be summarized.

All continuous data obtained in this study and documented in the eCRFs will be listed and 
tabulated with descriptive group statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, 
maximum). For discrete data, counts and percentages will be  summarized.  
1.9.3.6.  Biomarker Analysis  
CSF and/or serum or blood samples will be analyzed for the concentration of biomarkers and 
their relationship to efficacy outcomes at each visit. In addition, relationships between 
neurotropic factors, inflammatory markers , miRNA expression , T regulatory cells and clinical 
outcomes will be evaluated to determine if any biomarkers can be predictive to treatment 
outcome or prognostic to disease progression.  Analyses will be detailed  in the SAP . 
1.9.3.7.  Genetic analyses  
Bone marrow derived mononuclear cells, or MSC of study participants, derived from the Bone 
Marrow aspirated at Visit 5, will be collected for DNA isolation and genetic profiling of ALS 
related genes to assess whether response to NurOwn® treatment correlate s with specific ALS 
genetic mutations or gene variants .  Participants that have already completed or discontinued 
the study will be reconsented and asked to provide buccal swabs for DNA analysis. They  will 
not be required to return to the clinic to provide  the sample .

The only circumstance in which a deviation from the current IRB -approved clinical 
protocol/consent form(s) may be initiated in the absence of prospective IRB approval is to 
elimin ate an apparent immediate hazard to the research subject (s). In such circumstances, the 
Sponsor/Investigator will promptly notify the clinical sites IRB of the deviation.   
Changes to the protocol to minimize or eliminate immediate hazards or to protect the  life and 
well-being of research participants (e.g., to limit exposure to COVID -19) may be implemented 
without IRB approval or before filing an amendment to the IND  (FDA guidance  on Conduct of 
Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Pandemic ). 
The clinical sites IRB operate in compliance with FDA regulations at  21 CFR  Parts 50 and 21 
CFR 56,  and in conformance with applicable International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)  
E6 Guidelin es on GC P.  
In the event that the clinical sites IRB require, as a condition of approval,  substantial changes 
to a clinical protocol submitted under an FDA -accepted IND application, or in the event of the 
Sponsor -Investigator’s decision to modify the previously accepted clinical protocol the 
Sponsor/Investigator will submit (i.e., in advance o f implementing the change) a Protocol 
Amendment to the IND describing any change to the protocol that significantly affects the 
safety of participants , the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study.   
Examples of clinical protocol c hanges requiring the submission of a Protocol Amendment 
include:  
• Any significant change in the number of participants  under study.  
• Any significant change in the design of the protocol (such as the addition or deletion of 
a control group).

1.15.2.  Appendix 2 : ALSFRS -R 
The ALSFRS -R is an ordinal, validated rating scale used to  evaluate level of impairment of 
patient with ALS in 12 functional activities. The 12 functional areas further group into four 
domains that encompass gross motor tasks, fine motor  tasks, bulbar functions and respiratory 
function ( Table 3). The ALSFRS -R motor score (gross and fine motor scores combined) will 
also be assessed . 
Each question is graded on a 5 -point scale from 0 = unable to do to 4 = normal ability. 
Summation of all individual answers will be a reported sc ore of 0 = worst to 48 = best. 
Summation of all answers within a doma in will give the domain score.

1.15.3.  Appendix 3 : SVC  
SVC measures the maximum amount of air a subject  can exhale in a single breath. SVC is 
reported as a percent of normal for gender, height, and age  based on the highest of three trials  
as calculated in EDC .  
1.15.4.  Appendix 4 : C-SSRS  
Suicidal ideation and behavior is assessed using the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS).  
The binary responses, yes or no, can be categorized in one of the following:  
Category 1 – Wish to be Dead  
Category 2 – Non-specific Active Suicidal Thou ghts  
Category 3 – Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act  
Category 4 – Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan  
Category 5 – Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent  
Category 6 – Preparatory Acts or Behavior  
Category 7 – Aborted Attempt  
Category 8 – Interrupted Attempt  
Category 9 – Actual Attempt (non -fatal)  
Category 10 – Suicidal Behavior  
The suicidal ideation score is the maximum suicidal ideation category (1 -5 on t he C -SSRS) 
present at the assessment. If no ideation is present, the suicidal ideation score is 0.  
A “yes” answer at any time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal ideation questions 
(categories 1 -5) on the C -SSRS will be categorized as “Suicid al ideation”. A “yes” answer at 
any time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal behavior questions (categories 6 -10) 
on the C -SSRS will be categorized as “Suicidal behavior”. A “yes” answer at any time during 
treatment to any one of the ten suici dal ideation and behavior questions (categories 1 -10) on the 
C-SSRS will be categorized as “ Suicidal ideation or behavior”.

1.15.5.  Appendix 5 : Procedure for IT transplantation of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  or 
placebo  
The purpose of this document is to describe the  procedure and define the basic requirements for 
Intrathecal (IT) transplantation of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  or placebo  in Brainstorm’s  
clinical trials.  
The procedure described here is based on common clinical practice (standard lumbar puncture 
procedure) .  
1.15.5.1.  Product Handling and injection procedures  
All syringes shall  be gently rotated for 20 -30 seconds until all cells are in suspension.  
Prior to  IT injections gently remove syringe cap. With the syringe in the upright position,  gently 
flick syringe to surface any trapped bubbles. Slowly and carefully,  push plunger up, until the 
liquid meniscus is visible at the top of the (needle -less) syringe. Co nnect syringe to the 3rd outlet 
of the valve, and inject the cells over roughly 2 minutes (see Section  1.15.5.2 . below).   
1.15.5.2.  IT Injection Procedure:   
1. When performing IT transplantation of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells) , the participant  is 
typically placed in a left (or right ) lateral position with his/her neck bent in full flexion 
and knees bent in full flexion up to his/her chest, approximating a fetal position as much 
as possible.   
2. The area around the lower back is prepped using aseptic technique . A 20 G, 3.5 inch, 
0.9x90 mm spinal needle (such as: BD Cat. No. 405253) is inserted between the lumbar 
vertebrae L3/L4 or L4/L5 to a depth at which there is a “give” indicating that the needle 
is past the ligamentum flavum.   
3. The needle is inserted further until there is a second ‘give’, indicating that the needle is 
now past the dura mater and in the subarachnoid space.   
4. The stylet from  the spinal needle is then withdrawn and a 3 -way stopcock (such as Elcam 
Medical Cat. No. 582682) is immediately attached to the spinal needle.   
5. A 5 mL syringe, with the plunger drawn back, is attached to the 2nd outlet of the stopcock, 
and approximately 4-5 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed (CSF is not 
‘aspirated’ since any negative pressure can be harmful, so the syringe plunger is drawn 
back before connecting the syringe, and the syringe with the drawn -back plunger is then 
connected to the 2nd outlet of the stopcock and the CSF thus flows into the syringe).   
6. The syringe containing the CSF is removed and  the stopcock  is closed, the air is remov ed 
from the syringe and the syringe is then again placed at the 2nd outlet of the stopcock. 
The CSF is re-injected back only after the injection of the NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  
or placebo as described below.   
7. A second syringe containing a 4 mL suspension of NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  or 
placebo  is attached to the 3rd outlet of the valve, and the contents of the syringe  are 
injected over roughly 2 minutes.

Phase 3 Clinical Protocol BCT -002 US   Amendment 2.1 : March  2020 NurOwn® (MSC -NTF cells)  Page 66 of 66 
8. The stopcock is then immediately turned back to the 2nd ou tlet and approximately 1 mL 
of the previously collected CSF is injected, “washing ” the spinal needle and ensuring 
that the entire cell suspension is transplanted into the subject .  
9. The procedure is completed by withdrawing the needle and immediately placin g pressure 
on the puncture site.   
10. The syringe containing the remaining 2 mL of CSF is removed and capped and shall  be 
processed and transferred to storage at -80ºC within 1 hour  of the completion of the 
procedure.  
11. The participant  is typically asked to lie on his/her back fo r at least 2 hours, on a 
Trendelenburg position and is monitored for signs of neurological problems.

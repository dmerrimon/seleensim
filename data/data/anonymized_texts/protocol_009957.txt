A serious deterioration in the health of the subject 
that either resulted in:
a.a life -threatening illness or injury .
Note: Life -threatening means that the 
individual was at immediate risk of death fr om 
the event as it occurr ed, ie, it does not include 
an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurr ed in a mor e sever e 
form.
b.any potentially  sight -threatening event or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a 
body  function.
c.in-patient hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitaliza tion.

existing condition, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not consider ed a 
serious adverse event. In general, 
hospitalization signifies that the individual 
remained at the hospital or emer gency war d 
for observation and/or tr eatment (usually 
involving an overnight stay) that would not 
have been appr opriate in the physician's office 
or an out -patient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospitalization ar e adverse 
events. If a complication pr olongs 
hospi talization or fulfills any other serious 
criteria, the event is serious. W hen in doubt as 
to whether “ hospitalization ” occurr ed, the 
event should be consider ed serious.
d.a medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
a) or b). 
e.any indirect harm as a consequence of

7INVESTIGA TIONAL  PLAN
7.1 Study Design
This will be a prospective, randomized,  controlled, double -
masked, parallel -group, daily wear clinical study .
This clinical study will engage approximately  14-17 clinic sites to enroll approximately  
252
subjects with approximately  15-21subjects per site. 
Subjects will be expected to attend 4 office visits: Screening / Baseline / Dispense, We ek 1 
Follow -
up, M onth 1 Follow - up, and Month 3 Follow up /Exit. The total expected duration of 
participation for each subject is approximately  3 months in this daily  wear study . Subjects 
will be randomized to wear either the test 
 contact lenses in both eyes or the control 
Biofinity  contact lenses in both ey es.
Following randomization, study  lenses will be dispensed to the subject.  
 
 
Subjects will wear the lenses while awake in a daily wear modality . CLEAR CARE will be 
used for dail y cleaning and disin fection.

7.4 Rationale for Choice of Control Product
The Biofinit y contact lens was chosen as the control product because this lens is a prop er 
device to compare to  contact lens with regard to effectiveness and safety . Both the 
 contact lens and Biofinity  contact lens are frequent replacement SiHy  lenses and are 
to be prescribed for daily wear . The Biofinit y contact lenses are in dicated for the optical 
correction of refractive ametropia (m yopia and h yperopia) in phakic or aphakic persons with

Lack of performance
11.2 Monitoring for AEs
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity  to spontaneousl y mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by  asking the standard questions:
“Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
 
 
 
 
 
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of inform ed consent. Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study  (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History  section of the eCRF .
 
 
 
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity , treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality . In addition, the I nvestigator must document all device deficiencies r eported or 
observed with test and control product s on the Device Deficiency  eCRF .

Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .
Device deficiencies are doc umented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency eCRF must be included with product returns.
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.

Page 51of 63
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the su bject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by Study  Sponsor utilizing the same definitions, as shown below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related 
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the AE was caused by  the medical device or stud y procedure.
Not Related An AE classif ied as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).

12.4 Effectiveness Analyses
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.4.1 Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint(s)
The primary  effectiveness objective is to demonstrate noninferiorit y   compared to 
Biofinity  in mean CL CDV A at Week 1 Follow-up.
The primary  endpoint is the mean CL CDV A at Week 1 Follow- up. The corresponding 
assessment is collected with study  lenses, in Snellen, for each ey e. Conversion w ill be made 
to the logMAR scale. 
12.4.1.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.10 
(in logMAR scale) for noninferiority :
H0: μ(T)− μ(C)≥ 0.10
Ha: μ(T)− μ(C)< 0.10

where μ(T)andμ(C)denote the Week 1 Follow -up mean CLCDV A for  and Biofinity  
contact lenses, respectively , on the logMAR scale .
12.4.1.2 Analysis Methods
A mixed ef fects repeated measures model will be utilized to t est these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit (Dispense, W eek 1 Follow - up, Month 1 Follow -up, and 
Month 3 Follow -
up), and lens -by-visit interaction as fixed ef fects, protocol as a random 
effect and baseline best corrected distance V Aas a covariate. W ithin-subject correlation due 
to ey e will also be accounted for in the model. Lens dif ference (  minus Biofinity ) and 
the corresponding two -sided 95% CI will be computed for 1 -Week Follow -up. Noninferiorit y 
in CLCDA will be declared if the upper confidence limit is less than 0.10.
12.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint
The secondary  effectiveness objective is to demonstrate noninferiorit y 
  compared 
to Biofinity  in the percentage of subjects achieving CLCDVA 20/20 or better ,in each ey e,at 
Week 1 Follow -up.
The corresponding end point is the percentage (proportion) of subjects with CL CDV A of 
20/20 or better , measured monocularly ,in both OD and OS at Week 1 Follow -up.
12.4.2.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.10 
(10%) for noninferiorit y.
H0: P(T)– P (C)≤ -0.10
Ha: P(T)– P (C)> -0.10
where P (T)and P (C)denote the proportion of subjects attaining at least 20/20 in CL CDV A at
Week1 Follow -up in each ey e (OD andOS) for  and Biofinity  contact lenses, 
respectivel y.
12.4.2.2 Analysis Methods
A binary  variable will be defined for each subject to indicate whether the CLCDV A at Week 1 
Follow -up is no worse than 20/20 in both OD and OS, and the corresponding proportion will 
be computed for each lens using the number of subjects as the denominator  
 
 From the two
-sided 95% CI  on the lens dif ference (  minus Biofinity ),

overall.
12.6 Safety Analys es
The safet y endpoints are:
AEs
Biomicroscop y Findings
Device Deficiencies
There are no safet y hypotheses planned in this study . The focus of the safet y anal ysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of AE as well as the other listed 
parameters.
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs informed consent to study  exit will be 
accounted for in the reporting. Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for ocular 
and nonocular AEs will be presented by  Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities

1. Abstract  
 Vitamin D has been shown as an important marker of prognosis in a variety of 
clinical settings, including overall mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 
infec tion/sepsis, asthma, cardio vascular disease, diabetes, and 
pediatric/medical/sur gical intensive care unit outcomes. Vitamin D not only plays a role 
in bone maintenance, but also a variety of extra -axial functions including immune -
dysregulation and systemic  inflammation. In addition, a number of randomized clinical 
trials support the supplementation of vitamin D as improving outcome in critical care 
patients. While the evaluation of vitamin D levels remains a standard -of-care at our 
institution, the widespre ad use of vitamin D monitoring and impact on neurocritical care 
patients remains limited. Our recent prospective observational study of vitamin D levels 
in neurocritical patients showed that deficiency (<20 ng/ml ) was highly associated with 
prolonged hospit al stay and increased in -hospital mortality for emergent patients. 
Moreover, a number of limitations arise from this study due to its observational nature. 
This study proposes a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, single 
center evaluation of vitamin D supplementation in the neurocritical care patient 
population (Table 1). Patients admitted to the neurocritical care unit for emergent 
cases and with vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml ) will undergo vitamin D serum 
draw on admission and be randomized to receive cholecalciferol/vitamin D3 
supplementation (540,000 IU once orally) or placebo with the primary measured 
outcome being hospital length -of-stay. Secondary outcomes will include length of 
hospital course, length of ICU course, compli cations, adverse events, discharge 
Glasgow Outcome Score , in-hospital and 30 -day mortality, as well as quality -of-life. 
Power analysis estimates 198 patients will be needed for each subgroup  to determine a 
2 day difference in length -of-stay, and we plan to  recruit 218 patients per treatment arm 
to account for dropout, which will take approximately 6 -9 months to recruit. Interim 
analysis and safety monitoring will be performed. We hypothesize that vitamin D 
supplementation may make a significant impact on re ducing morbidity and mortality in 
the neurocritical care population. The possibility of reducing hospital length of stay and 
mortality from a simple and cheap intervention such as vitamin D supplementation may 
be a useful adjuvant treatment in the neurocri tical care population.  
 
2. Background/Rationale  
 Hypovitaminosis D has a high prevalence among the general population, with 
some studies showing over half of the elderly population being affected (Chapuy 1997). 
Among critically ill patients, various studie s have shown associations between 
hypovitaminosis D and multiple negative outcomes including mortality (De Haan 2014, 
Rech 2014), ARDS (Dancer 2015), and infection (Flynn 2012). Vitamin D deficiency has 
also been shown to have impacts on various neurologic al diseases such as stroke 
(Yalbuzdag 2015, Chung 2015), and dementia (Littlejohns 2014). While the mechanism 
between vitamin D deficiency and these diseases is not entirely known, evidence 
suggest that vitamin D can affect vascular reactivity, inflammatio n, and the immune 
system (Carthy 1989, Vargas -Vasserot 2011) (Table S1, Figure S1 -2). 
 Vitamin D has been shown to impact prognosis in a variety of retrospective and 
randomized clinical trials within a n intensive care unit (ICU) environment (Amrein 2011). 
Despite these findings, there have been no studies examining the impact of 
hypovitaminosis D in specialized neurocritical care units (NCCU).   Given the often 
significant differences in the management of patients in NCCU and more generalized 
intensive care units (Kurtz 2011) there is a need for further inquiries into the impact of 
low vitamin D levels in this specific environment. This study proposes a randomized, 
double -blinded, placebo -controlled, single center evaluation of vitamin D 
supplementation in th e emergent NCCU patient population (Table 1) . We have 
previously conducted a prospective, observational analysis of 823 NCCU patients and 
shown a significant reduction in hospital length -of-stay for all patients (7.14 vs. 5.97 
days, p=0.0018) and for emerg ent cases (8.21 vs. 6.36 days, p=0.038), as well as 
reduced in -hospital mortality for emergent patients with non -deficient vitamin D levels 
(26/203 vs. 22/321, p=0.021). Nevertheless, these results remain limited in being 
observational studies without rand omization or controls.  
 
3. Study purposes and objectives  
1. Evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the length -of-stay of 
emergent neurocritical care patients (primary outcome)  
2. Evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on in -hospital mortal ity, ICU 
length -of-stay, Glasgow Outcome Score  on discharge, complications, and 
quality -of-life metrics (secondary outcome)  
3. Evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on Glasgow Outcome score 
and quality -of-life metrics at 3 and 6 months post-dischar ge (secondary outcome)

• Pregnant or nursing women  
 
4.3. General protocol  
1. Patients will be identified through primary treatment teams, including the 
Departments of Neurosurgery and Neurology,  and through screening of 
the electronic medical record for patients admitted to the NCCU at the 
University of Utah Health Sciences Center. Patients admitted for non -
elective indications as outlined in the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. 
The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. We expect 
most patients to be admitted to the neurosurgery service and NCCU . 
2. A Vitamin D level will be drawn on all non -electively admitted NCCU 
patients as part of our standard admission protocol.  
3. Patien ts with a Vitamin D level <20 ng/ml , defined as deficient, will be 
consented for the trial. Patients that do not consent for the trial will be 
studied retrospectively as part of our standard -of-care similarly to our 
previous prospective trial . Women between  18-45 years of age will 
undergo a serum or urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy prior to 
enrollment.  
4. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3, 
540,000 IU once orally or by feeding) immediately or placebo by random 
numbe r generator. Treatments will be blinded to the patient and physician 
care teams. Placebos will include similar tablets or liquid formulations that 
mimic the treatment drug but are indistinguishable .  
5. A subsequent Vitamin D level wil l be drawn 3 days after drug 
administration  or on date o f discharge if sooner than 3  days to evaluate 
the adequacy of vitamin D repletion . 
6. Primary outcomes will total hospital length -of-stay. Secondary outcomes 
will include in -hospital mortality, ICU length -of-stay, ICU complicat ions 
(rates of sepsis/bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection), discharge 
Glasgow Outcome Score , medication adverse events , and quality -of-life 
metrics . Various patient demographic data will be acquired.  
7. Subsequent 30 -day mortality will be measured on standard clinical follow -
up.  
8. 1, 3 month and 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scores and quality -of-life 
metrics will be obtained.  Physical therapy gait distance measurements as 
well as modified Rankin scale on discha rge will be obtained.  
 
4.4. Safety monitoring  
 There are minimal risks related to the patient. Vitamin D treatment is a relatively 
safe procedure in properly selected individuals. There may be additional discomforts 
including close monitored by the researc h team in order to monitor the study and collect 
data. The risk and side effects for Vitamin D administration are minimal and discussed 
further in the drug description. We have outlined a detailed data and safety monitoring 
plan.  
 We have previously shown Vitamin D administration in our prospective, 
observational study for patients with Vitamin D levels <10 ng/ml  to be safe and without 
any adverse effect at dosages of 50,000 IU Qweek of ergocalciferol/vitamin D2. The 
dosages used in this study are comparable  to other studies evaluating Vitamin D 
efficacy and safety (Bacon 2009, Von Restorff 2009, Amrein 2011, Amrein 2014). There 
was no reported adverse event from ergocalciferol/vitamin D2 administration during our 
prospective, observational trial along with r ecent trials evaluating cholecalciferol/vitamin 
D3. 
 For patient safety, we will continue daily monitoring of CBC, BMP, Calcium, 
Phosphate, and neurological examinations as per standard practice in the neurocritical 
care unit. Should risks be identified, m odification of the protocol will be proposed. And 
should the trial prove unsafe, we plan to notify the IRB and terminate the study.  The 
study principal investigator and co -investigators will be responsible for oversight of 
patient safety. In addition, a n independent safety and data review committee of licensed 
physicians will evaluate the study data on a quarterly basis. Quarterly safety and data 
monitoring reports will be discussed among the investigators and safety committee. The 
study will remain doub le-blinded except in the case of possible safety issues warranting 
unblinding.  
 Participants will be withdrawn from the study should they demonstrate >grade 3 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) suggesting  Severe or 
medically significant  but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation 
of hospitalization indicated. In addition, patients will be withdrawn from the study should 
they show other signs/symptoms of vitamin D toxicity including, hypercalcemia, 
anorexia, naus ea, vomiting, as well as polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, nervousness, 
pruritus, laboratory studies suggesting renal injury or failure (proteinuria, urinary casts, 
azotemia, metastatic renal calcifications). A checklist will be used to monitor patients. 
These findings can be uncovered by routine neurological and laboratory exams as per 
the ICU standard. Should adverse events be identified at higher or clustered rates than 
expected statistically, the trial will be modified or terminated.  
 
4.5. Informed conse nt 
 The goals of the study, including potential benefit and minimal risk, will be 
discussed. Patients will be told that not participating in the study will not affect their 
hospital care. We will provide patients with a copy of the informed consent contain ing 
contact information for the investigators. In addition, we will inform the critical care staff, 
including nursing and administration, regarding the study so patients can find the 
appropriate research staff should they have questions.   All interim and d ata safety 
analysis when analyzed will be immediately conveyed to all study participants in the 
event of potential adverse events or risks.  
 In some cases a legally authorized representative (LAR) will be used for informed 
consent of the patient. Many of t he emergent patients admitted to the NCCU will not 
have the capacity for an informed consent. LARs may include spouses or patient 
children, as well as authorized legal healthcare proxies, depending on policies for 
informed consent at the University of Utah  Health Sciences Center. As with studies of 
Vitamin D in other critical care settings, patient consent through a proxy may be 
possible. We will include a LAR signature block at the end of the consent document.  
 Phone consents will be allowed as part of the  trial to ensure timely consent. 
Similar, to surgical or procedural consents, phone consents will involve discussion with 
a LAR  and informed consent will be documented by the study investigator as well as a 
witness, usually the patient’s nurse. Phone conse nts will be performed when the patient 
is incapacitated and family is unable to reach the hospital to sign the paper consent.  
 
4.6. Privacy protection  
 Information about each participant, including the results of tests, will be 
confidential. Each participant will be assigned a study number and we will not use the 
participant's name in our study records. Paper records will be kept in a locked file 
cabinet in a secure room. Computerized records will be kept in a locked room on 
password -protected comp uters. The participant's name will not be used in any 
published reports.  
 
4.7. Facilities and staff  
  The principal investigator and co -investigators are all licensed physicians within 
the department of neurosurgery with experience in both basic and clinic al science 
research. All investigators have had prior database research experience, including IRB 
submission as well as data acquisition and analysis. The faculty advisor, is a licensed 
physician as well as a board -certified neurosurgeon and Assistant Prof essor at the 
University of Utah, has also reviewed the protocol and will be involved in patient safety 
monitoring as well as quality control. He has been involved in our prior prospective, 
observational study on Vitamin D status of neurocritical care patie nts. The project will be 
discussed by meetings and by email as necessary to discuss results, patient safety 
issues, and data quality. All investigators are already trained in research methodology, 
have completed CITI certification, receive annual training on research bioethics through 
the Department of Neurosurgery, and have been trained on aspects of informed 
consent.  
 The research will be primarily performed at the University of Utah Hospital. Some 
data analysis may be performed on computers within the Neurosciences Center at the 
University. The NCCU  at the University Hospital will be the predominant facility used for 
research activity. Other ICUs will be used if neurosurgery or neurology patients are 
admitted. All information related to be data will be kept in  a HIPAA -compliant database 
or locked cabinet units only accessed by the principal investigator. The University of 
Utah Neurocritical Care Unit (NCCU)  NCCU is a 23 -bed intensive care unit which 
specializes in the treatment of patients with critical neurological illness, such as stroke, 
intracranial hemorrhage, status epilepticus, traumatic brain injury, and meningi tis. The 
NCCU is the region’s largest and most technologically advanced critical care unit and 
the catchment are for the NCCU comprises 20% of the geographical area of the 
continental United States. Nurses specially trained in caring for neurological patie nts 
who require intensive care staff the NCCU in conjunction with 5 neurointensivists and a 
multidisciplinary team of neurologists and neurosurgeons.   
 
4.8. Selection of therapeutic agent  
 Patients will be supplemented with cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or  placebo. Two 
major vitamin D compounds exist in humans, ergocalciiferol (vitamin D2) and 
cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and recent guidelines suggest that either vitamin D2 or 
vitamin D3 can be supplemented in patients with hypovitaminosis D (Holick 2011). One 
study evaluating short -term supplementation with vitamin D2 in an critical care setting 
demonstrate that only 26% of patients receiving 50,000 IU three times per week 
achieved normal vitamin D levels (Dickerson 2015). Critically ill patients have been 
suggested to have a blunted response to vitamin D supplementation. Nonetheless, a 
number of randomized trials have shown the ability of high dose vitamin D3 to adequate 
replete critically ill patients with minimal toxicity, mostly mild hypercalcemia ( Qurai shi 
2015, Nair 2015, Amrein 2011, Amrein 2014). Intramuscular (200,000 IU) or oral 
(540,000 IU) have been shown to adequately replete vitamin D levels in the majority of 
patients by 2 -7 days after treatment. For this reason we have chosen to supplement 
with cholecalciferol (540,000 IU orally).  
 
4.9. Power analysis and statistical plan  
 A variety of variables will be collected on patients (Table 2). We estimated 
various sample sizes based on our preliminary, prospective, observational trial. Using 
length -of-stay as a primary outcome, previously we detected a significant decrease in 
patients with sufficient vitamin D levels (>20 ng/ml ) (8.21 vs. 6.36 days, p=0.002). Using 
an effect size of 2, alpha of 0.05, 1:1 case/control sampling, we estimate 198 patients 
will be required per group for this study. We plan to recruit patients to account for a 10% 
dropout resulting in 218 patients per group, total 436. We also performed power 
calculations using various other outcomes including, in -hospital mortality, as well a s 
evaluation of both emergent and non -emergent patients. Based on a 6 -month timeframe 
needed to  enroll 512 patients in our prospective, observational trial, we estimate the trial 
would take 12 months  for enrollment and randomization in the proposed trial . The 
primary outcome (length -of-stay) will be measured by T -test as well as multivariate 
regression to adjust for potential confounders using SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY). 
Secondary outcomes will be evaluat ed by a variety of statistical methods.  
 
4.10. Funding source  
 Planned sources of funding for this study are from internal departmental grants 
without potential for conflicts -of-interest. No submission for additional funding sources is 
planned at this time . 
 
5. Anticipated results and potential public health impact  
 The potential benefit of this study would include knowledge about the success of 
vitamin D supplementation on various critical care outcomes. While they may not 
directly apply to a patient, they  can be useful to additional critical care patients admitted 
an ICU in the future. The societal benefit will include reduced patient morbidity and 
mortality, as well as shorter hospital stays and therefore reduced ICU expenditure. 
Vitamin D is a relatively  cost-effective  medication that is well -tolerated. Its potential 
impact to reduce hospital stays, by even 1 day would play a significant role in reducing 
patient cost, disease morbidity, and risk from hospitalization. Future research directions 
can involv e a multi -center randomized clinical trial to validate the effect of vitamin D in 
the neurocritical care patient  as well as further molecular studies evaluating the non -
skeletal effects of vitamin D . Addition al, studies on vitamin D as a biomarker and effe cts 
on a cellular level can also be forthcoming if a potential benefit is identified clinically. 
Identification of the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D may alter disease 
pathology may serve as a method for the development of additional treatments.  
 
6. Protocol amendments  
 6.1. 1/10/17, Addition  of phone consents as well as two study co -investigators, 
Aatman Shah, MD and Al -Wala Awad, MD was performed . Repeat vitamin D 
levels at 3 days following administration of study drug or placebo was modified 
from prior planned repeat vitamin D at 7 days.  
 6.2. 8/6/17, Addition of physical therapy assessment and modified Rankin scale 
as secondary outcomes of the study. Change of study faculty sponsor from Dr. 
Min S. Park to Dr. Sarah T. Menacho as Dr. Park is leaving the University of 
Utah.

8 1.0 Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
 
1.1 Background Information  
 
Novel molecular diagnostics to identify bacteria and determine antimicrobial susceptibility from 
clinical cultures are quickly entering the arsenal of tools used by clinical microbiology laboratories. 
However, the clinical benefit of these methods has not been well -quantified.  
 
The goal of this study is to determine the impact of rapid bacterial  identification and phenotypic 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) on antimicrobial usage and clinical outcomes .  
 
The Accelerate PhenoTest ™ BC Kit, performed on the Accelerate Pheno ™ System (together 
termed AXDX)  (Accelerate Diagnostics, Tucson, AZ)  is an FDA -approved fully automated 
platform that performs rapid bacterial identification within 1.5  hours followed by determination of 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) -based phenotypic susceptibility  within approximately 7 
hours directly from positive blood cultures.1 This novel  system uses fluorescence in situ  
hybridization (FISH) for rapid bacterial identification for a panel of organisms followed by  time-
lapse microscopy for determining phenotypic AST directly from positive blood culture bottles  (see 
Table 1) . In a study of 1850 blood cultures with gram -positive, gram -negative, or yeast isolates, 
AXDX  was found to have overall 97.4% sensitivity and  99.3% specificity for organism 
identification compared to conventional culture methods  (see Table 2) . Among 728 gram -negative 
isolates, AXDX had 97.6% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity for pathogen identification, and had 
excellent essential  (device result  agrees exactly with or within one two- fold dilution of the 
reference result)  and categorical (the device and reference result interpretive categories agree)   
agreement with the gold- standard methods  for drug susceptibility testing , according to Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA) and/or Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) breakpoints  
(see Table 3 )1.

1.2 Scientific Rationale  
 
Bacter emia due to gram -negative bacilli (GNB) poses a dangerous threat due to increasing rates 
of resistance and high mortality with ineffective antibiotic therapy .2-6 Convers ely, treatment with 
overly broad antibiotics increases risks of adverse drug events and drives further development of 
resistance.7,8  An important solution to address this conundrum is development of methods for 
rapid detection of drug resistant  GNB, which would allow for rapid de- escalation or escalation o f 
antibiotics  to appropriate definitive  therapy .9  Standard turn- around- time for clinical microbiology 
laboratories to isolate, identify, and perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacterial  
isolates is 48 -96 hours  from the time a blood culture turns positive, while r apid testing methods 
can provide results within 6-24 hours . Strategies for rapid phenotypic AST of GNB are preferred 
over m ethods for genotypic resistance detection, which cannot reliably predict  the numerous 
antibiotic  resistance mechanisms in GNB .2,10,11   
 
Prior  single -center , observational studies  have demonstrated decreased time to appropriate 
antibiotics , lower  mortality , shorter  durations  of hospital and ICU  stay, and reduced costs when  
rapid identification and AST methods are coupled with antimicrobial stewardship.12-14  Limitations 
to these studies inc lude the fact that they were retrospective, subject to temporal trends, single-
center, and uncontrolled. A previous single- center , randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that  
rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based identification paired with antimicrobial stewardship 
intervention was associated with more rapid anti biotic de -escalation, shorter time to appropriate 
antibiotic therapy , and less use of broad- spectrum antibioti cs.15 However, t he diagnostic test 
evaluated in that study had limited impact on managem ent of patients with GNB bacteremia 
RAPIDS -GN  Version 4.0

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
10 because the test detected only a single GNB resistance determinant ( blaKPC), and did not provide 
rapid phenotypic susceptibility information for a full panel of antibiotics.  
 
Accelerate’s AXDX is the first FDA -approved platform to provide both identification and rapid 
phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility  testing of organisms  directly  from positive blood cultures.  We 
will evaluate the clinical impact of AXDX  testing for GNB bacteremia in a multicente r, prospective, 
randomized, controlled clinical trial. This study will evaluate the impact of AXDX testing in the 
setting of baseline antimicrobial stewardship activities, because current regulations mandate that 
all acute care settings have antimicrobial stewardship programs ,16,17 and several prior studies 
demonstrate benefit of  combining rapid testing with antimicrobial stewardship.  Results from th is 
study  will inform strategies to improve diagnostic testing for GNB  bacteremia.  
  
2.0 Hypotheses  
 
We hypothesize that subjects with GNB bacteremia who receive rapid testing of blood cultures 
using AXDX will have faster time to antibiotic modification within the first 72 hours  following 
randomization  compared to subjects who receive standard bacterial culture and AST .  
 
3.0 Objectives  
 
3.1 Primary Objectives  
 
The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of rapid identification and AST on time to 
first antibiotic modification in the first 72 hours after randomization.  
 
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the impact of rapid identification and AST on 
antibiotic u tilization and clinical outcomes . 
 
4.0 Study Design  
 
This study will be  a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled  trial evalua ting antimicrobial 
utilization and clinical outcomes among patients with GNB  bacteremia.  Patients will be 
randomized to one of the following arms:   
 
1. Standard culture and AST  
2. Rapid identification and AST using AXDX  
 
Baseline antimicrobial stewardship will occur in both arms. The blood sample for arm 2  will also 
undergo standard culture and AST in addition to the rapid testing.  
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
Patients who meet the following inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria, will 
be included in the study:   
• Positive blood culture with Gram stain showing  GNB identified during local laboratory 
business hours.  
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
  
Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:   
RAPIDS -GN  Version 4.0  
 November 30, 2018  
  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
11 • Identification of GNB outside of local laboratory business hours  (e.g. whenever 
laboratories are staffed to perform both rapid testing and routine testing)   
• Positive blood c ulture for GNB at the same institution  within prior 7 days  (if 
known at the time of randomization) .  
• Deceased at the time of randomization .  
 GNB  plus gram -positive organism , gram -negative cocci,  and/or yeast  detected 
on Gram stain  
 Previous enrollment in this study  
• No Minnesota research authorization (Rochester site only)   
 
If the patient does not meet any of the above exclusion criteria, he/she will be 
randomized, and laboratory testing will be performed according to group assigment.  
 
5.0 Study Procedures  
 
5.1 Screening and Enrollment  
 Eligible patients will be identified based on positive blood culture bottles with Gram stain 
showing GN B. The Microbiology Laboratory Technologists will screen for exclusion 
criteria and then will enroll patients who do not meet any exclusion criteria.  
 
This study will not require informed consent because this FDA approved test is being 
used for its approved indication, in addition to standard of car e. Furthermore, the rapid 
test is not being evaluated for its diagnostic accuracy (which has been determined by 
studies used to gain FDA approval), but rather to determine whether its use in the clinical setting can improve quality of patient care.  
 
5.2 Randomization  
 
Patients meeting enrollment criteria will be assigned, in a 1:1 ratio using permuted 
blocks , to one of the two arms outlined in Section 4.0. The randomization scheme will be 
stratified by site.  Randomization will occur  at the time the Gram stain detecting GNB is 
identified  by the lab. Randomization will be performed by the Lab oratory  Technologists , 
using an electronic system.  
 
5.3 Interventions  
 5.3.1  Notifications  
 
Once study group is assigned, the L aboratory  Technologists will immediately  notify the 
Study Coordinator via electronic or telephone page.  The Study Coordinator will then 
notify the Antimicrobial Stewardship ( AS) team that a subject has been randomized to 
either arm . Each subject’s medical record number, group assignment and subject ID w ill 
be recorded in an electronic log.  
 For subjects in both arms, t he Laboratory Technologist s will notify ordering clinicians by 
telephone when the Gram stain results are available , as is done in routine clinical 
practice.  
 Sites are responsible for  notifying  appropriate agencies of  reportable infectious diseases 
per institutional policy.  
 
5.3.2  Standard Subculture and AST  
 
RAPIDS -GN  Version 4.0  
 November 30, 2018  
  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
12 For all patients, t he local standard of care for identification  and AST of GNB from positive 
blood cultures will be performed, including  standard subculture and AST as well as 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry  (MALDI -TOF MS ). If the 
primary or AS team s desire to have additional drug susceptibility information that is not 
routinely  reported, they may req uest this information from the Microbiology Laboratory.  
 
If standard culture methods detect a gram -positive organism , gram -negative cocci, and/or  
yeast instead of a gram -negative organism ( as was originally detected on Gram stain) , 
the culture result will be reported in the medical record, as per standard of care, and the 
subject will be considered unevaluable as he or she will not have GNB bacteremia.   
 
5.3.3  Rapid identification and AST  
 
For patients randomized to the rapid testing arm, testing will be performed during local 
laboratory business hours , using the AXDX system . Several milliliters  of material from the 
positive bottle will be used to perform the testing, while the remainder will be used for standard of care testing. If no targ ets are identified using the rapid testing panel  (see 
Table 1, Section 1.1) , then identification and AST will be done through standard methods 
only. Combinations of bacteria/antibiotics that are reported by AXDX but not routinely 
reported by each laboratory  will be suppressed for study patients. GNB/antibiotic 
combinations that are not reported by AXDX , but are routinely reported by the lab using 
standard of care testing, will be added to the final AST report for study patients.  
 
If there is disagr eement between the rapid AST and the standard AST  results , any 
“intermediate” or “resistant” result will be reported, regardless of testing method. T he 
primary  team  caring for the patient  will be notified by phone  of discrepant results, and 
additional susceptibility testing will be performed as needed and determined by the site 
Laboratory D irector . Discrepant  results will be reviewed by the Microbiology Laboratory  
Director as detailed in section 6.0.  If the primary  or AS teams desire to have additional 
drug susceptibility information that is not reported by AXDX or standard of care testing, 
they may request this inf ormation from the Microbiology Laboratory.  
 If the AXDX assay detects a gram -positive organism , gram -negative cocci, and/ or yeast 
(that was not originally noted on Gram stain) in addition to GNB , the laboratory 
technologist will review the Gram stain. If the gram -positive organism or yeast is seen 
upon review, the following FDA -approved gram -positive  or yeast  organism identifications 
along with AST  will be reported in the medical record: Staphylococcus aureus, 
Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata,  
coagulase- negative staphylococci, Enterococcus  species, Streptococcus  species.  If the 
gram -positive bacteria or yeast is not seen upon review of the Gram stain, the AXDX 
result will not be reported, as this test is not FDA approved for clinical use if organisms 
are not visualized by Gram stain.  If the AXDX assa y detects a gram -positive organism , 
gram -negative cocci, and/ or yeast instead of GNB  (as was originally detected on Gram 
stain ), the AXDX result will not be reported. In these cases, if standard culture  methods 
detect other organisms instead of GNB , the standard culture result will be reported in the 
medical record, and the subject will be considered unevaluable as he or she will not have 
GNB bacteremia.   
5.3.4  Antimicrobial Stewardship  
 
All patients  in both arms of the study  will undergo prospective audit and feedback by the 
institutional AS program s. The AS physician or pharmacist will review t he subject’s  
microbiology results  and medical records . The AS provider will contact the primary 
service (or the consulting infectious diseases  (ID) physician, if applicable) if modifications 
RAPIDS -GN  Version 4.0  
 November 30, 2018  
  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
13 to therapy are indicated,  at any time following notification of positive Gram stain result, 
organism  identification,  and/or AST results . If the ID service is consulting on the subject, 
the AS team will contact the ID service rather than the primary service. If the rapid test 
result is ready when the AS team is unavailable (i.e. in the evening or weekend), the AS 
team will review the record and make recommendations at the beginning of the following 
working day. Local institutional treatment guidelines will be followed. Recommendations 
will be communicated to the treating teams via telephone or pager and documented per 
institutional standards. Recommendation types and acceptance rates will be recorded in 
the study database.  Categories of recommendations include: intravenous to oral 
conversion, de -escalation of gram  negative coverage, de- escalation of gram  positive 
coverage, escalation of gram  negative coverage, escalation of gram  positive coverage, 
dose optimization, discontinuation of therapy, therapeutic drug monitoring, reduce/define duration of therapy, ID consultation , and other . More than one stewardship 
recommendation category may be chosen.  
 
In addition to prospective audit and feedback , other routine institutional AS activities will 
continue, such as  implementation of institutional treatment guidelines , prior authorization 
of restricted antibiotics, review of all patients on selected antibiotics with feedback to 
clinicians, and daily review o f specific culture results.  
 
5.4       Blinding  
 
Primary service/provider: The primary service, including the prescribing provider, will be 
unaware of group assignment at the time of randomization, so initial antibiotic choice will 
not be affected by group assignment. O nce rapid results become available and/or AS 
interventions  are made, treating providers may become aware of group assignment.  
 
The AS team and laboratory technologists will not be blinded.  
 
5.5 Assessments  
  
For this study, all measurements and assessments will be taken from the electronic medical 
record ( EMR ) and are done as routine standard of care practice.  
 
5.5.1  Baseline Assessment  
   
Once a patient is randomized, information about the patient’s demographics, comorbid conditions, severity of illness  (e.g. components of the Pitt Bacteremia Score
18-20), and 
microbiology  and antimicrobial suscep tibility  results will be recorded.  Whether a patient is 
on comfort care will be recorded, as determined by review of the primary physician team notes and any relevant consultations (e.g. Palliative Care).  
 5.5.2  Daily Evaluations  
 
Information about additional microbiology results  and antibiotic treatment will be gathered 
from the EMR  during the three days following randomization.  Suspected source and site 
of infection will be recorded by the AS providers . 
 5.5.3  Antibiotic spectrum and antibiotic intensity score  
 
The antibiotic intensity score will be determined as follows: Each antibiotic is assigned an 
antibiotic spec trum rank from 1- 5 (see Table 4). The antibiotic rank will be multipled by

14 score will be the summation of the rank x duration product for each antibiotic. If a single 
dose of antibiotic is administered, duration wi ll be considered 1 hour.  For all antibiotics 
given for more than one dose, the duration will be the time of administration of the last 
dose minus the time of administration of the first dose  (or time of randomization, if subject 
was receiving antibiotic at  randomization) plus one hour . Patients who die before 72 
hours will be assigned the highest intensity score among patients in the study who were 
alive at 72 hours.

7.2.1  Primary Outcome Measure s 
 
• Mean time until first modification  of antibiotic therapy (in hours) within 72 hours post 
randomization  
 
7.2.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
 
• In-hospital m ortality within  30 days  of randomization  
• Length of stay in the hospital  after randomization , up to 30 days, for those 
patients alive at 30 days. Length of stay will be date of discharge minus date of 
randomization.  
• < 72 hours or ≥ 72 hours  in the ICU after randomization.    
• Mean time to antibiotic escalation i n those who have antibiotic escalation within 
72 hours from randomization. This will be further broken down by whether the 
escalation was in gram  positive coverage, gram  negative coverage, or both.  
• Mean time to antibiotic de- escalation i n those who have antibiotic de- escalation 
within 72 hours from randomization. This will be further broken down by whether 
the de- escalation was in gram  positive coverage, gram  negativ e coverage, or 
both.  
• Hospital -onset Clostridium difficile  within 30 days, as defined by the National 
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This wi ll be normalized to patient -days .22 
• Acquisition of new hospital -acquired infections  (HAIs)  and/or multidrug resistant 
organisms (MDROs) within 30 days during index hospitalization identified on 
routine clinical or surveillance sampl es. Thi s will be normalized to patient -days. 
Cultures that will be tracked include the following,  from any specimen source, 
unless otherwise indicated : 
o Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus   
o Vancomycin- resistant  Enterococcus   
o 3rd generation cephalosporin non- susceptible Enterobacteriaceae  
o Carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae, as defined by the CDC: 
resistant to imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, or ertapenem OR 
documentation that the isolate possesses a carbapenemase 23  
o Multidrug- resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistant to 
aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems)24  
o Carbapenem -resistant Acinetobacter  
o Candida species (isolated from blood cultures  only)  
 
7.2.3  Exploratory Analyses  
 
• Standardized costs, obtained from the UHC/Vizient database  
• The primary endpoint  will be analyzed comparing patients who are: 
o in the ICU at baseline versus not in the ICU at baseline 
o neutropenic at baseline versus not neutropenic at baseline  
• The primary endpoint will be analyzed excluding antibiotic modifications made within 
the first hour after randomization, as these changes may be in response to Gram 
stain result rather than AXDX result  
• 30-day readmission to the index hospital  
• The proportion of discrepancies (as detai led in 6.0) between rapid testing and 
standard of care testing among subjects who receive rapid testing (arm 2)  
• Antibiotic intensity score (as detailed in 5.5.3)  in the first 72 hours post randomization

7.3 Sample Size  
 
The study is designed to detect a difference in primary outcome, mean time to first antibiotic 
modification in the first 72 hours after randomization.  We plan to enroll 500 unique participants 
(250 in each arm) in order to have at least 200 evaluable participants in each arm . Participants 
who died prior to randomization,  were on comfort care at time of randomization, had GNB 
bacteremia at same or different  institution within 7 days  prior to randomization, or who were 
erroneously randomized due to laboratory issues such as spurious  Gram stain result, will be 
considered unevaluable. This will provide 80% power with a 2-sided alpha=0.05 test,  to detect a 
difference in the time to first modification of antibiotic therapy between the two arms of at least 9 
hours, with a standard deviation (SD) of 32 hours . With 500 participants, if the SD is larger than 
32 hours, there will still be sufficient p ower  to detect a difference between the arms  of 10 or more 
hours (see Table 8 ).   
 We assume that differences in the primary outcome will be due to the rapid testing results. We 
anticipate that most subjects will be receiving empiric broad- spectrum antibiotic therapy at 
randomization, and a difference between the arms of 9 hours or more in time to antibiotic 
escalation or de- escalation  would be reasonable based on the turn- around- time of the rapid test, 
and clinically relevant with regards to risk s of ineffective therapy or prolonged exposure to broad-
spectrum agents . Estimates for  the SD for time to first modification of antibiotic therapy  are based 
on data from subjects with GN B bacter emia from the BCID trial
15. We assume that the arm 
including stewardship in the BCID trial (BCID test plus AS) , is a reasonable surrogate for the 
RAPIDS standard testing  arm. This is because the BCID test provided minimal s usceptibility 
results for GNB , and did not impact time to antibiotic modifications for subjects with GNB 
bacteremia15. Based on the BCID trial data, in the RAPIDS standard testing arm, we expect 63% 
will have antibiotic de -escalation with mean time of 31 hours (SD  27), 23% will have antibiotic 
escalation with mean time of 18 hours  (SD 21), and 14%  will have no antibiotic change. 
Incorporating the participants with no change, we expect the overall mean time to change in the 
standard tes ting arm will be 33.75 hours (SD 28.8) .  We anticipate that the rapid testing arm will 
have similar frequencies of antibiotic de -escalation, escalation, and no change. Based on the 
turn-around- time of the rapid test, we estimate that mean time to antibioti c de- escalation and 
escalation will be approximately 12 hours (SD 24) . Incorporating subjects with no antibiotic 
change , we expect the overall  mean time to antibiotic modification in the rapid testing arm will be

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
18 20.4 hours (SD 30. 5). The sample size was s elected to allow the study to be well powered if this 
is an optimistic  estimate of the standard deviation.

7.4 Analysis  
 
7.4.1  Analysis  of primary outcome 
 
We will calculate the mean difference in time to first antibiotic modification within 72 hours  
post randomization in both treatment arms , together with a 95% confidence interval. 
Patients who do not have antibiotic modifications  will be assigned a time of 72 hours.  The 
primary test will be a t -test ( relying on a normal approximation, allowing for unequal 
variances in the treatment groups) for whether the mean of the primary outcome is different between the  arms. We will also carry out a Wilcoxon rank -sum test , to compare 
the distribution of the time to first antibiotic modification between the arms  without the 
assumption of normality . We will estimate the probability of having an escalation or de-
escalation of antibiotics between 0 and 72 hours after randomization using the empirical 
cumulative distribution function  with pointwise 95% confidence intervals . 
 The primary analysis will be a modified intention to treat analysis (ITT). Participants who 
died prior to randomization,  were on comfort care at randomization as assessed by the 
study coordinator, had GNB bacteremia at same or different institution within 7 days  prior 
to randomization, or whose blood culture had erroneous Gram stain results in the 
laboratory  will be considered unevaluable. These are all issues which may not be known 
to the laboratory  technologist  at the time of randomization and wou ld otherwise be 
exclusion criteria.  Participants randomized to the rapid testing arm will be analyzed as 
randomized, including cases where the rapid test does not return a result.  
 
 
7.4.2  Analysis of secondary and exploratory outcomes  
 
We will compare all secondary and exploratory outcomes  between the rapid testing and 
standard testing arms. Where interest lies in mean differences, we will follow the same 
approach as for the primary outcome. The DOOR s will be compared between arms  to 
estimate the probability (w ith 95% CI) that a randomly selected participant will have a 
better DOOR outcome if assigned to rapid testing . We will determine the proportion of 
very major errors and very major or major errors among patients who recei ve rapid 
testing .

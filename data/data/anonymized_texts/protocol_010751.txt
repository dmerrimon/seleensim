Clinical Study Title: A prospective open -label study to evaluate safety and effectiveness of 
two different reconstitution volumes of poly -l-lactic acid (PLLA) for 
correction of w rinkles in the décolletage area
Clinical Trial Number: 43USSA2112
Country Involved and 
Planned Number of Study 
Centers:Country: USA
No. of Study Centers: 2
Clinical Study Design: This is aprospective open -label study to evaluate safety and 
effectiveness of two different reconstitution volumes of poly-l-lactic 
acid (PLLA) for correction of wrinkles in the décolletage area.
Approximately 30 adult female subjects will be enrolled in the study 
and randomized 1:1 to receive either Sculptra reconstituted with 8 mL 
Sterile Water For Injection (SWFI) with the addition of 1 mL 2% 
lidocaine hydrochloride (HCl),or Sculptra reconstituted with 17 mL 
SWFI with the addition of 1 mL 2% lidocaine HCl. Subjects will be 
stratified by Galderma Décolletage Scale (GDS) severity score 
(moderate or severe) and by study center. 
Eligible subjects will be offered treatment with Sculptra in four 
sessions spaced one month (+2 weeks) apart. Safety and effectiveness 
data will be collected for up to 9 months following the initial 
treatment. 
The study visits are illustrated inthe Clinical study flowchart . 
Assessments are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments and 
summarized in Sections 6and 7.
Effectiveness assessments include: 
Photography 
Grading of wrinkles in the décolletage area by the 
Treating Investigator using the GDS 
Global aesthetic improvement by the Treating 
Investigator and Subject using Global Aesthetic 
Improvement Scale (GAIS).  
Safety assessments include: 
An evaluation and an interview  of the subjects at each 
visit to obtain inform ation about any medical occurrence 
that meets the definition of an AE
Subject diary
Laboratory assessment
Indication: Correction of moderate or severe wrinkles in the décolletage area.

Page 25of 752.2 Safety objectives and endpoints
Safety  objective: 
To evaluate the safet y of Sculptra for correction of wrinkles in the décolletage area.
Safety  endpoints:
1.Incidence, intensity , time to onset and duration of Adverse Events (AE)s collected 
throughout the stud y period.
2.Incidence, intensity , time to onset and num ber of days of pre -defined expected post -
treatment events collected using subject diaries for 28 day s from each treatment.
3.STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Overall design
This is a prospective study  to evaluate the safet y and effectiveness of Sculptra for correction of 
wrinkl es in the décolletage area. 
Approximately  30 subjects will be enrolled in the study  and randomized 1:1 to receive either 
Sculptra reconstituted with 8 mL SWFI with the addition of 1 mL 2% lidocaine hydrochloride 
(HCl) or Sculptra reconstituted with 17 mL SWFI with the addition of 1 mL 2% lidocaine HCl. 
Subjects will be stratified by  GDS severit y score (moderate or severe) and study  center. 
Eligible subjects will perform a screening visit and baseline visit;these visits may be combined, if 
appropriate. Eligible subjects will be offered treatment with Sculptra in four sessions spaced one 
month (+2 weeks) apart. 
Subjects will be injected with Sculptra by the Treating Investigator at Baseline. Sufficient amount 
of product, as determined by the Treating Investigator, should be injected to achieve optimal 
correction, which is defined as at least a one grade improvement on the GDS and best correction 
that could be achieved as agreed upon by the Treating Investigator and the subject. Three 
additional treatment sessions may be performed if needed to achieve optimal correction, as 
determined by the Treating Investigator and subject. Treatment will stop when optimal correction 
has been achieved and subsequent visits will be follow -up visits.

discuss the pertinence and the modalities for the subject to continue in the clinical study .
3.8.5 Documentation and recording instructions
Prior and concomitant therapies are to be recorded in source documents and on the appropriate 
form in the eCRF. Concomitant therapies are to be recorded, reviewed, and updated at each visit. 
Any new concomitant therap yor modification of an existing therap y may be linked to an AE. A 
corresponding AE form must be completed to account for the change in therapy , except in some 
cases such as therap y used for proph ylaxis, or dose modification for a chronic condition.
4. STUDY P OPULATION
The study  population will comprise adult women, aged 22years or older, with intent to undergo 
correction of décolletage wrinkles. Subjects must have a GDS score of 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) 
at enrollment. Study  Inclusion criteria are presented in Section 4.2.1 . Study  Exclusion criteria are 
presented in Section 4.2.2 . 
4.1 Subject information and informed consent
The Sponsor will provide an approved sample subject information and informed consent form 
(ICF) to each site. Prior to performing any study  procedur e, the subject must be informed (in non-
technical terms) by the Investigator (or designee) orally , and in writing, about the nature, 
importance, intended purpose, possible benefits, possible risks of thecurrent trial and the opinion 
of the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Furthermore, they will be informed about randomized 
allocation to treatment groups, and alternative treatments available. The subjects will be informed 
that theparticipation in the trial is entirel y voluntary  and that they might withdra w from the study 
at an y time without stating an y reason and without prejudicing future medical treatment.
Subjects must also be informed that clinical records relevant to the study  may be disclosed to the 
Sponsor, the monitor, a quality  assurance auditor and to authorities responsible, in order to verify  
adherence to applicable laws and GCP. Data will be collected, recorded, processed, and may be 
transferred to other countries. The data will not contain any information that can be used to 
identify  any subject. The subject must be assured that all personal data will be treated with the 
utmost confidentiality . 
The information shall beprovided ina language clearl yandfully under standable tothesubject.
Subjects must be allowed sufficient time to make a decision and consent freel y to participate in the 
study . Subjects will be required to read, sign, date the ICF, summarizing the discussion prior to 
screening/ before any study -related activities are perfo rmed. Subjects will sign and date one copy 
of the ICF, the Investigator/designee providing the information and obtaining the consent will also 
sign. The copy will be retained by the subject and the original will be retained on file by the 
Investigator. By signing the ICF, subjects agree that they  will complete all evaluations required by 
the study , unless they  withdraw voluntaril y, or are terminated from the study, for an y reason.
Photographs collected during the study  will be analy zed and stored in a datab ase by the Sponsor 
and its representatives in order to evaluate the effect of the treatment in the study . The subjects 
will be recognizable on the photographs, but their names will not be disclosed.
If information concerning the device and/or the trial that may be relevant to the subject becomes 
available during the study , the Sponsor will provide this to the Investigator (in written form) and

Page 32of 754.3 Subject identification number
Prior to any study procedures being conducted, the subject must sign the ICF. Each subject who 
has signed the ICFwill be assigned a screening number. Upon randomization, each subject will be 
assigned a subject identification number that will be allocated in ascending order within each 
center. A screen failure is a subject who signed the informed consent, but was never enrolled (i.e.

documents should indicate which assessments ha ve been made and the reason why  the subject was 
determined to be a screen failure. A screen failure should not be re -entered in the study .
For the duration of the clinical study , each subject will be identified using the subject number for 
all documentatio n and discussion. 
4.4 Procedures/Reasons for subject discontinuation/withdrawal
Each subject must be advised in the I CF that the subject has the right to withdraw from the study  at 
any time, for any reason, without prejudice. Subjects may also be discontinued from this study  if 
the Investigator determines that it is in the subject’s best interest to do so and may  be withdrawn at 
the Investigator’s discretion at any  time.

Page 52of 757.6 Adverse events
7.6.1 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury , oruntoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory  findings) in subjects, users or other personsa, whether or not related 
to the study  product. 
This definition includes:
a)events related to the investigational product or the reference product
b)events re lated to the procedures involved
7.6.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An SAE is an AE that:
a)led to death,
b) led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in
1.a life -threateningbillness or injury , or
2.a permanent impairment of a bod y structure or body function, or
3.in-patient or prolonged hospitalizationc, or
4.medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury  or 
permanent impairment to a body  structure or a body  function, 
c)led to fetal di stress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect
In cases of doubt, whether an AE fulfils a serious criterion or not, there should be a predisposition 
to report as a SAE rather than not report as such (see Section 7.8.3 ).
7.6.3 Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Effect 
An anticipated AE for Sculptra is any AE included in the study  specific IFU. An unanticipated 
adve rse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safet y or any life-threatening 
problem or death caused by , or associated with, the investigational device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously  identified in nature, severit y, or degree of incidence, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the right, safet y or welfare of 
the subject (see US requirement CFR 812.3 (s)).
                                                
aFor users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the investigational device .
bThe term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
(Source: ICH- E2A clinical safety data management : definitions and standards for expedited reporting ).
cPlanned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the CIP, without serious deterioration 
in health, is not considered a SAE. (Source: ISO14155:2011).

Page 53of 757.6.5 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  itself is not regarded as an AE.
If there is a pregnancy  during the study  period, the subject must be withdrawn from any  subsequent 
study  treatment but should continue to be followed within the study  and the outcome of pregnancy 
must be reported even if the delivery  occurs after study  completion. Details of pregnancy  reporting 
are outlined in Section 7.8.5 .
7.7 Safety recording instructions
Each subject with an AE occurring after enrollment through study  exit should be fully recorded in 
the source document(s) for further transc ription into the eCRF. Each subject should be questioned 
about AEs at each study  visit following randomization and treatment. The question asked should be: 
”Since your last clinical visit; have you had any health problems?” Information on AEs can also be 
obtained from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, or from a laboratory  test, 
observations made by the study  site personnel, subject diaries, or spontaneous reports from the 
subjects or their relatives. 
When an AE is related to a device deficiency  (refer to Section 7.9 ), including technical device 
malfunction, the AE shall be recorded on the AE form/module in the eCRF and the technica l 
complaint shall be reported separatel y on the clinical study  complaint form, provided separatel y in 
the Investigator file, and the eCRF. 
Investigators, or other study  site personnel, shall record all AEs in the eCRF, including:
a)Event term (recorded in standard medical terminology  and avoiding abbreviations)
b)Affected area
c)Start date (first day  with sy mptoms)
d)Stop date (last day  with sy mptoms)
e)Intensit y (mild, moderate, or severe according to definition in Section 7.7.1 )
f)Seriousness (serious or not serious, according to definition in Section 7.6.2 )
g)Causal relationship to study  product or study  product injection procedure (yes or no, see 
Section 7.7.2 )
h)Action taken (none, medication treatment, non-pharmacological treatment, or other 
procedures/tests, subject withdrawn)
i)Outcome of the AE (ongoing, recovered, recovered with sequelae, death, chronic/ stable, not 
recovered at the end of the study )
The AE form/module in the eCRF must be signed and dated by the Investigator.
The pre -defined, expected post-treatment events shall be assessed separately . These events shall be 
collected dail y by subjects in a diary  for up to 28 day s after each treatment.

7.9 Device deficiencies
7.9.1 Definition of a device deficiency
A device deficiency  is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identit y, 
quality , durabilit y, reliability , safetyd, or performance.
Note: Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labelling.
7.9.2 Recording instructions
When a device deficiency  is discovered, Part A of the clinical study  complaint form must be 
completed by the Investigator and the source data recorded in the eCRF. The type of complaint 
must be described and injury  to the subject or user, or unintended exp osure to study  device, must be 
reported as applicable. If an injury  has occurred, an AE or an SAE form must be completed as 
applicable (refer to Section 7.8). If no SAE was experienced as a result of the device deficiency , the 
Investigator must assess whether or not the device deficiency  could have led to an SAE if:
Suitable action had not been taken,
Intervention had not been made or,
Circumstances ha d been less fortunate
In Part B of the clinical study  complaint form, the Sponsor will make the same assessment. 
7.9.3 Reporting of device deficiencies
The Investigator must send the completed clinical study  complaint form to the CRO. 
A device deficiency  that led to a SAE and any device deficiency  that could have led to a SAE must 
be reported to the CRO within 24 hours after the Investigator’s awareness (for contact information, 
see Section 7.8.2 ). Ifthe form is completed within theeCRF system, refer to the eCRF completion 
guidelines.
                                                
dInadequacy of device safety refers to properties of the device which could have or have led to an AE.

Page 66of 75All statistical analyses, including summary  tables and data listings, will be performed using SAS. 
Confidence intervals will be two- sided and constructed at a confidence level of 95%. 
All endpoints will be summarized descriptively . Continuous endpoints will be summarized using 
mean, median, standard deviation (SD) , minimum and maximum values, for the observed value as 
well as the change from baseline. Categorical endpoints will be presented in frequency  tables with 
number and percentage of observations f or each level.
9.2 Analysis populations
The following populations will be defined:
Safety Includes all subjects who were treated with Sculptra. 
Subjects are anal yzed based on the as treated principle (i.e. 
according to the treatment actually  received).
Intention- to-treat (ITT) Includes all subjects who were randomized based on the as 
randomized principle (i.e. according to the treatment they 
were randomized to). 
Per protocol (PP) Includes all subjects in the ITT who complete the visit 9 
months after baseline without any deviations considered to 
have substantial impact on the primary  effectiveness 
outcome.
The ITT is the primary  population for all effectiveness analy ses. The primary  effectiveness analysis 
will be repeated using the PP analy sis set if there is at least a 10% difference in the number of 
subjects between the PP and ITT sets. Safet y analy sis is performed based on the safety  population 
set.The disposition of subjects will be presented in tables and/or figures as appropriate.
9.3 Demographics, baseline assessments, and subject characteristics
Demographic endpoints, baseline assessments, and subject characteristics will be presented by 
treatment group, based on the ITT anal ysis set using descriptive statistics, as appropriate.
9.4 Effectiveness analysis
Continuous endpoi nts will be summarized using descriptive statistics, e.g. mean, median, SD, 
minimum and maximum values. Categorical endpoints will be presented in frequency  tables with 
number and percentage of observations for each level.
Responder rate regarding GAIS and GDS will be presented together with a 95% confidence interval 
(based on the binomial distribution). The difference in responder rate regarding GAIS and GDS will 
be calculated between the two groups presented together with a 95% confidence interval.
No adjustment to the level of significance will be performed; p-values obtained for any endpoint 
other than the primary  will only  be provided for ease of interpretation of the results.
9.5 Safety analysis
The number and percentage of subjects reporting each pre-defined, expected, post-treatment 
symptom, as collected in the 28-day diary, will be presented in total and by maximum intensity . 
Number of days with the event will be presented by treatment group and category : 1, 2 -7, 8-14, and 
15-28 day s.

9.6 Handling of missing data
The number of missing values will be summarized and reported as appropriate. For the ITT anal ysis 
of the Treating Investigator GDS Responder rate at Month 9 after baseline (primary  endpoint), 
missing values will be assumed to be missing due to lack of effect. Therefore, the primary  method 
of imputation will use the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) method. Impact of missing 
data on the primary  endpoint will be evaluate d by performing sensitivity  analysis based on the 
observed cases, as well as worst -case and best -case imputation in the I TT set. 
All other effectiveness endpoints will be evaluated based on the observed cases in ITT.

Page 69of 7510.2 Personnel training
The study  monitor will ensure that the Investigator and study  site personnel understand all 
requirements of the protocol, and their regulatory  responsibilities as an Investigator. Training will 
be provided at the Investigator’s meeting and may also be provided at the study  site, and/or by 
instruction manuals. In addition, the study  monitor will be available for consultation with the 
Investigator and will serve as the liaison between the study  site and the Sponsor.
Study  sites must adhere to good documentation practice (GDP) for all maintained records and for 
any applicable changes to these records. GDP princip les must be adhered to, and all records must be 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, complete, chronological, consistent and 
permanent. All relevant study  site personnel must undergo training in the key elements of GDP at 
the site in itiation visit (SIV), and training must be documented for each person. 
10.3 Data management and documentation
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities defined to achieve safe routines to enter 
clinical data information into a database, efficiently and to avoid errors. The data management 
routine includes procedures for database set-up and management, data entry  and verification, data 
validation, and documentation of the performed activities including information of discrepancies in 
the process. Thedata management process will be described in detail in the data management plan 
(DMP).
The database, the data entry  screens and program will be designed in accordance with the CIP and 
the eCRF template. Data validation will be performed by computerized logical checks and manual 
review. Drugs and events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) 
Drug and MedDRA dictionaries as specified in the DMP. Safety  data (SAE and if applicable AESI ) 
in the clinical database will be reconciled ag ainst the data in the safet y database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in the 
database is as correct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study  data will 
be transferred to SAS datasets, which thereafter will be write -protected. Statistical analy ses will be 
generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.
10.3.1 Data entry and collection 
An electronic data capture application, compliant with regulatory  requirements for softw are 
validation US FDA 21CFR11 will be used to collect, modify , maintain, archive, retrieve, and 
transmit study  data. An eCRF is required and shall be completed electronically  for each screened 
subject (screening visit) and enrolled subjects (subsequent vis its). 
The eCRF includes password protection and internal qualit y checks, such as automatic range 
checks, to identify  data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Study  data shall be 
entered directly  from the source documents, which are to bedefined at each site before inclusion of 
the first subject.
Authorized study  site personnel designated by the Investigator shall complete data collection. 
Appropriate training and securit y measures shall be completed with all authorized investigation site 
personnel prior to the study  being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any 
subject.

Page 70of 75The study  data is the sole property  of the Sponsor and shall not be made available in any form to 
third parties without written permission from the Sponsor, except for authorized representatives of 
appropriate RA. At the end of the study , electronic data are retained by the Sponsor and a copy 
(provided by the vendor) is retained at the study  site as part of the Investigator file.Any delegation 
of col lection of data shall be specified and recorded.
All data shall be entered in English. The eCRFs should alway s reflect the latest observations on the 
subjects participating in the study . Therefore, the eCRFs shall be completed as soon as possible 
during, or after, the subject’s visit. The subject’s identity  must alway s remain confidential, i.e. the 
name and address of the subjects must not be registered in the eCRFs or in the database. The 
Investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some 
assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available, not applicable or unknown, the 
Investigator shall indicate this in the eCRF. The Investigator shall electronically  sign off the study  
data. By signing, the Investigator takes responsibility  for the accuracy , completeness, and legibility 
of the data reported to the Sponsor in the eCRF.
The monitor shall review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency . Each 
eCRF shall be compared with the respe ctive source documents to ensure that there are no 
discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections, and alterations shall be made by the 
Investigator or his/her authorized designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once study  
data have been submitted to the central server via the eCRF, corrections to the data fields will be 
audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person who made the change, 
together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the site personnel responsible for 
entering study  data into the eCRF shall be determined in advance. If discrepant data is detected 
during review of the data, either by the Sponsor or by its representatives, the responsible data 
manager or monitor shall raise a query  in the electronic data capture application. The query  shall 
state the question or data to be changed and shall be resolved in the system by the Investigator or 
his/her authorized designee. The appropriate study  site personnel shall answer the queries in the 
eCRF within a reasonable timeframe. Answered queries will be audit trailed by the electronic data 
capture application, meaning that the name of study  site personnel, time, and date are logged. 
Answered queries will then be closed by the appropr iate study  personnel (i.e. data manager, site 
monitor, etc.).
eCRF records will be automatically  appended with the identification of the creator, by means of 
their unique UserID. Specified records shall be electronically  signed by the Investigator to 
docum ent his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are accurate. This will be 
facilitated by means of the Investigator’s unique UserID and password; date and time stamps will 
be added automaticall y at the time of electronic signature. If an entry in an eCRF requires change, 
the correction shall be made in accordance with the relevant software procedures. 
All changes will be fully recorded in a protected audit trail and a reason for the change shall be 
stated. Once all data have been entered, verified, and validated, the database will be locked.
10.3.2 Source documentation
Source documents are all documents used by the Investigator or hospital, that relate to the subject’s 
medical history , that verifies the existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 
all records covering the subject’s participation in the study .They  include laboratory  notes, 
memoranda, material dispensing records, subject files, etc.

attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data 
should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry  and should be explained, if necessary . 
Source documents shall be made available for inspec tion by the monitor at each monitoring visit. 
The Investigator must submit a completed eCRF for each subject for whom signed informed 
consent has been collected.
All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, shall 
be clearl y identified with the CTN and subject number. Anypersonal information, including name, 
shall be removed or rendered illegible, to preserve individual confidentiality .
10.3.3 Archiving / record keeping
The Investigator/ Institution shall permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and RA 
inspections and shall provide direct access to the source data/medical record including the identity 
of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, i.e. eCRF, medical records, 
original signed ICFsand detailed records of study  product accountability ). The records shall be 
retained by the Investigator as required by local legislation and international guidelines. Any 
transfer of responsibili ty for storage of the records shall be documented and the Sponsor must be 
informed in writing.
The Sponsor shall verify that each subject has consented in writing to direct access to the original 
medical record/source data (by  the use of written subject i nformation and signed informed consent). 
The data recorded in the eCRFs will be checked for consistency  with the source documents/medical 
record by the monitor during monitoring (SDV). In order to be able to perform SDV, information 
about each subject’s participation in the study  must be detailed in the medical record or other 
relevant source. 
All records pertaining to the conduct of the study , including signed eCRFs, ICFs , study  product 
accountability  records, source documents, and other study  documentat ion must be retained for as 
long as is specified in the CTA after study  completion, or longer if required by national legislation. 
The Sponsor will inform the site(s) as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
Measures shall be taken to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents (e.g. 
protection against damage and unauthorized access, preferabl y by storage in a fireproof cabinet).
After study  completion and DBL , a security  sealed CD with electronic study  data shall be provided 
by the eCRF vendor for archiving .
It is the Investigator’s responsibility  to inform the Sponsor in writing if the Investigator file is 
moved or if the responsibility  for the documents is transferred elsewhere.
10.4 Quality control / quality assurance
10.4.1 Quality Control
On-site monitoring of the study  will be arranged by the Sponsor according to GCP guidelines to 
verify  that the rights and well-being of the subjects are protected, the reported data are accurate, 
complete, verifiable from source documents, and that the conduct of the study  complies with the 
approved CIP, subsequent amendment(s), GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements.

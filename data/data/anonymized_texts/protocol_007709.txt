Protocol of Investigational Study 
Study XVT-01 
1.0 Investigational Plan 
A multicenter clinical research study will be conducted in the United States and Canada. A total 
of 120 subjects will be enrolled with 60 subjects  in each arm to compare the safety and efficacy 
of the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt implanta tion versus trabeculectomy in patients suffering 
from glaucoma.  
2.0 Study Purpose 
The purpose of this study is to compare the sa fety and effectiveness of the Ex-PRESS mini 
glaucoma shunt to trabeculectomy in reducing the number of post operative complications, 
reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) and reducing the use of hypoten sive medications in subjects 
with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.    
3.0 Rationale for the Study 
Trabeculectomy has been the surgical treatment of choice for primary open angle glaucoma since 
1970s (1), its success rates and complications however are less than ideal. Early hypotony and 
bleb infections are still of concern. The Ex-PRESS, a miniature stainless steel glaucoma device approved by FDA since March 
2002, is widely used worldwide for open angle glauco ma patients. This procedure is theoretically 
more reproducible and simple to perform as we ll as less traumatic to the ocular tissue than 
traditional filtering surgery. With regard to the inclusion of subjects dia gnosed and being treated for ocular hypertension, 
several recently published studies demonstrate that in patients with elevated IOP, with or without 
the visual field loss or optic nerve damage of  glaucoma, lowering IOP provides benefit in long-
term outcome of subsequent visual  field loss (2-5).  In any case, all subjects enrolled in the study 
have the opportunity to be treated with ocul ar hypotensive medicati ons during the follow-up 
period as judged appropriat e by the investigator.  
4.0 Potential Risks and Benefits   
The potential risks with the use of the Ex-PRE SS are the same, with th e same probability of 
occurrence and of the same magnitude, as would be found with conventional glaucoma drainage 
surgery. They include a risk of bleeding, infection, too low an intraocular pressure after surgery, failure of the operation to control the intraocu lar pressure, corneal sw elling, risk of implant 
erosion, and double vision.   
The following potential benefits have been identified:   
 If the implant is effective and reduces intraocular pressure, the subject may reduce or eliminate glaucoma medication therapy.  
 If the implant is effective and reduces intr aocular pressure, the subject may not require 
additional glaucoma surgery.

Protocol XVT-01                                                                                                                                 Amendment - 3 
 
 If the subject requires additional glaucoma surgery post Ex-PRESS implantation, this option 
requires a smaller conjunctival incision th an trabeculectomy, therefore sparing more 
conjunctival tissue..  
 This procedure is less invasive than other conventional glaucoma  surgeries, thus resulting in 
potentially fewer complications. 
 
5.0 Background 
 
Glaucoma filtering surgery is indicated when glaucomatous damage progresses despite the 
attempt to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP)  obtained with pharmacological and/or laser 
treatment. In the past few years, filtering su rgery has improved, with an increased likelihood of 
successfully lowering the IOP while minimizing complications. While full thickness filtration 
procedures considerably reduced  the IOP, they were associ ated with early postoperative 
hypotony and related side effects and became pr ogressively less popular. Trabeculectomy has 
been the surgical treatment of choice for open angle glaucoma (OAG)  since the 1970s; its 
success rate and complication rate however are less than ideal. Ea rly hypotony and bleb 
infections are still of concern. The Ex-PRESS is a miniature stainless steel glau coma device, developed as an alternative to 
trabeculectomy and to the other types of glaucoma filtering surg ery for patients with OAG. The 
Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt is FDA a pproved since March 2002. This procedure is 
theoretically more reproducible and simple to pe rform as well as less traumatic to the ocular 
tissue than traditional filtering surgery.  
5.1 Clinical Studies 
Since the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt wa s FDA approved, post marketing studies were 
performed and presented in paper publications and meetings (1, 6-20). The Ex-PRESS was found 
to be safe and effective in the treatment of glaucoma subjects. A prospective randomized study 
comparing the Ex-PRESS to trabeculectomy in open angle glaucoma patients was performed in the Netherlands. A total of 40 subjects with primary open angle glau coma were enrolled in each 
study arm and followed for 1 year. The Ex-PRESS  implant under a scleral flap was found to 
have a more effective success rate, % IOP re duction and medication reduction compared to 
trabeculectomy (20).  
6.0 Device Description 
The Ex-PRESS is a miniature drainage device desi gned to regulate intraocular pressure in eyes 
suffering from glaucoma. The concept behind the Ex -PRESS is to divert aqueous humor through 
the implant from the anterior chamber to an intrascleral space - th e bleb. The Ex-PRESS 
glaucoma implant is manufactured from implantable stainless steel. It c onsists of a 2-3 mm long 
and 0.4mm outer diameter and 50 micron inner di ameter tube, which connects the anterior 
chamber to the intrascleral space. Despite its miniature size, the Ex-PRESS features several 
major structural elements (figure 1): 1. A cannula for draining aqueous humor fr om the anterior chamber to the 
intrascleral space.  
2. A plate to prevent excessive penetration. 
3. A spur to prevent extrusion of the Ex-PRESS
TM from the eye.

4. Reserve orifices near the distal end, which constitute an alternative conduit for 
aqueous humor drainage in case of occl usion of the primary (axial) opening of 
the cannula by the iris.

7.0 Study Objective 
The study objective is to compare the safety a nd effectiveness of Ex-P RESS implantation under 
a scleral flap versus trabeculectomy. 
7.1 Primary Effectiveness End Points 
The primary effectiveness measure will be quali fied and complete success rate defined as 
IOP≤18mmHg with or without medications in the test group as compared to complete and 
qualified success rate in the concur rent control group at 12 months. 
   
7.2 Secondary Effecti veness End points 
The secondary effectiveness measure will be quali fied and complete success rate defined as 
IOP≤18mmHg with or without medications in the test group as compared to qualified and 
complete success rate in the conc urrent control group at 24 months. 
7.3 Primary Safety End Points 
Post operative safety profile defi ned as vitreous loss and hypotony (IOP ≤5mmHg) and related 
complications (choroidal effusion, hyphema , shallow/flat AC, leaking bleb). 
 
7.4 Secondary Safety  End Points 
Comparison of the incidence of all adverse even ts that occur during th e intra-operative and 
postoperative periods between the two study arms. 
To evaluate and compare the incidence of elevated IOP (IOP spikes) in the immediate 
postoperative period in both study arms.  For th is study, an IOP spike will be considered an 
increase of 10mmHg or more from baseline (21).   However, all measurements will be collected and analyzed.

9.4 Subject Enrollment 
9.4.1 Informed Consent and Enrollment 
The informed consent/patient information sheet written in the subject’ s native language will be 
explained to each prospective subject by the investig ator or a trained clinical professional.  The 
final informed consent form must be approve d by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
Once the subject has been informed of all aspects of the study, the subject will then be given a 
choice to voluntarily confirm hi s or her participation in the study as documented by completion 
of the Informed Consent.  Afte r signing the Informed Consent and the HIPAA (Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Ac t) authorization, the subject  can then proceed with the 
screening evaluation.       The subject has the right to w ithdraw from the study at any time without consequences, as 
indicated in the Patient In formed Consent documentation. 
9.4.2 Baseline Evaluation 
After obtaining an understanding of the purpos e of this study, reviewing and signing the 
informed consent form, all potent ial subjects will undergo an exam ination in order to determine 
their eligibility for this study.      The screening examination will consist of applan ation tonometry to measure IOP, general slit-
lamp biomicroscopy to review the overall health of the eye, vi sual acuity (VA) measurements, 
and a review of current medications  and prior surgeries.    All in formation should be compared to 
the specific inclusion and exclusi on criteria in order to determine if the subject is eligible to 
participate in the study.   The following criteria are provided below to assist  with appropriate screening for all subjects in 
this study:     Diagnosis  
Investigator is to provide the diagnosis in each eye, as either ocular hypertension (elevated IOP 
without evidence of visual field loss or cupping of the optic  nerve head) or glaucoma (elevated 
IOP with either glaucomatous vi sual field loss, as judged by au tomated threshold visual field 
testing, or cupping of the optic nerve head.     Measurement of intraocular pressure  
Each time IOP is measured, the surgeon or te chnician is to utilize a Goldmann tonometer, 
however, an independent observer should read  the measurement and then record the 
measurement to minimize observer bias.   Two measurements should be taken and the mean  recorded on the case report form UNLESS 
they differ by more than 2 mmHg in which case a third measurement is taken and the median 
value is recorded.       Visual Field Examination  
Visual fields must be automate d threshold visual fields (e.g., 30-2 or 24-2 Humphrey).  SITA 
Standard visual fields are required.  Visual fields must be reliabl e, defined as less than 33% false 
positives, false negatives, and fixation losses.     The visual field must be performed within th ree to six months of study entry and meet the 
aforementioned requirements.  Both  the test eye and the fellow eye should have visual field data.

Protocol XVT-01                                                                                                                                 Amendment - 3 
  
Visual fields are to be performed with a non-dilated pupil unless, in the opinion of the 
investigator, the pupil is so miotic that dilati on is required (e.g., < 3 mm).  If dilation was 
performed at baseline, it should be performed at all subsequent  visual field examinations.  
However, dilation should not be performed before the IOP measurement on the appropriate visits.    For OAG subjects and in accordan ce with the American Acad emy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 
Preferred Practice Patterns, the se verity of glaucoma damage can  be assessed as follows: (1) 
Mild – characteristic optic nerve abnormalities are consistent with glaucoma, but there is a normal visual field and (2) Moderate – visual field abnormalities are in one hemifield and not 
within 5 degrees of fixation.    For OHT subjects, qualifying visual  fields must be normal and re liable in the study eye.   
  Cup-to-Disc Ratio  
A numerical expression indicating the percentage of di sc occupied by the optic cup.  A score 
from 0.1 to 0.9 (in 0.1 increments) should be indicated.   Visual Acuity 
Best corrected visual acuity will be measured at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Visual acuity will be measured using Snellen line method.   If a subject satisfies all inclusi on and exclusion criteria the subject will be enrolled into the study. 
The subject is then randomized to participate in either Group  A or Group B using the sealed 
envelope method of randomization.  Group A  Subjects will undergo implantation of the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt.

9.5 Surgical Procedure 
9.5.1 Materials and Equipment 
A listing of general equipment and materials needed for the preoperative, operative, and 
postoperative steps of th e investigational study is provided below.  
Goldmann Applanation Tonometer, Handheld dire ct ophthalmoscope, Viscoelastic Solution,    
Balanced Salt Solution, toothed forceps, tying forceps, non-toothed forceps, scissors, cautery, 
speculum, blades, punch, 25G or 23G needle and Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt.  
9.5.2 Surgical procedure 
Ex-PRESS implantation procedure  Local or topical anesthesia is administered  and the eye is prepared and covered using 
conventional sterile procedures. Implantati on is performed using a special introducer, 
conventional microsurgical instruments and a surgical microscope.  The Ex-PRESS, mounted on its introducer is inse rted into the anterior chamber at the limbus 
through the sclera under the scleral flap. The implantation procedure may be performed as follows: 1. Creation of a fornix or limbal based conj unctival flap in the upper quadrants  
2. Creation of a limbal-based scleral flap extending into clear cornea  
3. Delicate application of MMC solution onto the sclerectom y bed. (MMC concentration 
0.4mg/ml for 1-3 minutes) 
4. Penetration into the anterior chamber usi ng a 23-25G needle, halfway between the white 
sclera and the clear cornea (in the center of th e grey zone), and creation of a track incision 
at the limbus  
5. Prior to implantation, a thorough mob ility check should be performed 
6. Implantation of the Ex-PRESS implant loaded on  its introducer, through that pre-incision  
7. Withdrawal of the introducer 
8. Tucking the plate under the scleral flap, and verification of its position  
9. Suturing the scleral flap with sutures  
After the implantation procedure, antibiotics and steroids are admi nistered topically, the eye is 
covered with a pad and the patient is discharged.  
 Standard trabeculectomy procedure  1. Creation of a fornix or limbal based conj unctival flap in the upper quadrants  
2. Creation of a limbal-based scleral flap extending into clear cornea 
3. Delicate application of MMC soluti on onto the sclerectomy bed. (MMC 
concentration 0.4mg/ml for 1-3 minutes) 
4. Creation of fistula 1mm x 2mm in size 
5. Iridectomy 
6. Suturing the scleral flap 
7. Repositioning of the conjunctiva with sutures 
After the procedure, antibiotics a nd steroids are administered topi cally, the eye is covered with a 
pad and the patient is discharged.

  Intraocular pressure measurem ents during follow-up visits 
Each time IOP is measured, the surgeon or te chnician is to utilize a Goldmann tonometer, 
however, an independent observer should read  the measurement and then record the 
measurement to minimize observer bias.   Two measurements should be taken and the mean  recorded on the case report form UNLESS 
they differ by more than 2 mmHg in which case a third measurement is taken and the median 
value is recorded. All attempts should be made to conduct each follow-up evaluation within the specified time 
intervals (Table 2).

 Any ocular adverse events occu rring during the trial whether they  are considered to be device 
related or not must be documented in the subject ’s records.  Date and time of the event, its 
severity, treatment (if any) and the assessed re lationship of the event to the study will be 
recorded on CRF 4 Adverse Event Form.  Conditions which exist at the time the subject is 
enrolled do not need to be recorded on the Adve rse Event Form as adverse events unless they 
increase in severity during the study.     
  
A brief overview of the differences between an ticipated, unanticipated  and serious adverse 
events is provided below:       Anticipated Adverse Events  
Anticipated adverse events include those that might  reasonably be expected to occur in this study 
because they are associated with glaucoma surgical procedures.       Unanticipated Adverse Events  
  Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) incl ude any serious adverse effects on health or 
safety or any life-threatening pr oblem or death caused by or likel y directly related to the Ex-
PRESS mini shunt or the placement of the Ex-P RESS mini shunt within the eye that are not 
typically associated with glaucoma surgical procedures.    Serious Adverse Events  
  Serious adverse events include those events that require or prolong hospitalization, require 
surgical intervention, are sight or life-threatening or fatal, or result in significant disability or 
incapacity.

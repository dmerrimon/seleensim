Study Title
A Phase 4, Mult icenter, Single -Arm, Open -Label  Study  to Evaluate the Im pact of  Apremilast 
(CC-10004) on MRI Outcomes in Subjects w ith Psori atic Arthrit is
Indication
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) i s a heterogeneous inflammatory  rheumatol ogic disord er characterized 
byperipheral arthri tis
,affect ing 6 %to 39% of patients suffering fro m psori asis. PsA is classified 
as a seronegative spondyl oarthropathy  (SpA) because it shares certain features with other 
condi tions included in that group. Indeed, spinal involvement has been reported in approximately  
50% of patients with PsA. In addit ion, PsA is associated with enthesit is and dactylit is, which are 
extra -articular features commo n to SpA. Finally , the maj ority of patients with PsA are negat ive 
for the rheum atoid factor (Gladman, 2005 ; Kruithof, 2005 ).
Apremilast (CC -10004) i s an oral  phosphodi esterase enzyme (PDE) inhibitor. It is highly 
select ive for PDE4, whi ch is the dom inant PDE in inflammatory cells. Through inhibit ing PDE4, 
apremilast elevates intracellular cyclic adenosine mo nophosphate levels , leading to a parti al 
inhibit ion of the production of many pro -inflammatory mediators , as well as an increase in so me 
anti-inflammatory  mediators. Arecent study  in subjects with PsA indicated that apremilast was 
associ ated wi th reducti ons in tumor necrosi s factor –α (TNF - α) , interleukin ( IL)-17, IL -23, IL -6, 
IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein -1β,and monocyte chemoattractant p rotein 1 , as well as
increases in ant i-inflammatory  mediators, including IL -10 and the IL -1 receptor antagonist
(Schafer, 2015 ). It is believed, therefore, that apremilast exerts its therapeutic benefits through 
the modulati on of  multiple inflammatory  pathways.  
Following a com prehensive clinical development program, apremilast has been approved for the 
treatm ent of PsA and it is under clinical investigat ion for the treatment of Behçet ’s syndro me and 
inflammatory  bowel  disease. 
Apremilast has been shown to be eff icacious in halting inflammat ionandreducing signs and 
symptoms of PsA, as well as improving physical funct ion (Cutol o, 2016 ; Edwards, 2016 ; 
Kavanaugh, 2014; Nash, 2018). A question that remains to be addressed is whether apremilast 
can impact the structural progression of the disease. In addit ion, the extent of its structure 
modifying effects rem ains to be characterized using axial PsA specific imaging techniques and 
meth odologies.  
Magnet ic resonance imaging (M RI)has gained importance as a promising tool for early  
diagnosis and increasing acceptance as an outcome measure in clinical trials of different 
inflammatory  arthri tides. It is highly  sensi tive(Altho ff, 2007 ; Braun, 2004 ; Herm ann, 2005 ; 
Herm ann, 2006 )and superior to convent ional radiography  in depict ing inflammatory bone 
lesions of  the peri pheral  arthri tis and axial skeleton. Moreover, it candetect soft ti ssue 
inflammat ion, bone erosion ,and proliferat ion. As such, this study  is designed to assess the 
efficacy  of apremilast on MRI outcomes in subjects with active PsA, with less than 5 years of 
disease durati on (since diagnosis), and who are naïve to biologic therapi es.

1.1. Disease Background 
1.1.1. Psoriatic Arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis (Ps A)is a heterogeneous inflammatory  rheumatol ogic disorder characterized 
by inflammatory  arthri tis, enthesit is, dact ylitis and spondylit is, affect ing 6 %to 39% of the 
patients suffering fro m psori asis. 
The exact prevalence of PsA is unknown. Estimates of incidence vary fro m 0.3% to 1% of the 
popul ation.Disease onset ty pically  occurs between the ages of 30 and 55 y ears,and affects both 
genders equally (Gladman, 2005 ).
PsA is classified as a seronegative spondyloarthropathy  (SpA) because it shares certain features 
with other condi tions included in that group. Indeed, spinal involvement has been reported in 
approxima tely 50% of  patients wi th PsA. In addit ion, PsA is associated with enthesit is and 
dactylit is, which are extra -articular features common to SpA. Finally, the majorit y of patients 
with PsA are nega tive for the rheumatoi d factor ( RF) (Gladman, 2005 ; Kruit hof, 2005 ).
Recent studi es have challenged the assert ion that PsA is a more benign disease than rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). There i s an increasing body  of evidence that suggests that PsA patients experience 
progressive jo int destructi on over a relatively  short peri od of  time. The results from these studies 
indicate that PsA is erosive and deforming in nearly halfof the patients, wi th joint dam age 
appearing in the first y ears of disease onset. Other investigators later confirmed that 4 1% of the 
patients developed erosive disease wit hin 2 years of onset of symptoms (Helliwell, 2015).
PsA is also associ ated wi th a high burden of disease. PsA ha sbeen shown to have a similar 
impact on phy sical function, qualit y of life (QoL) and abilit y to work asRA. 
When co mpared to 
patients wi th psoriasis alo ne, patients with PsA had a furt her diminished QoL. Lastly, PsA was 
associ ated wi th a significant ly higher (60%) ri sk of m ortali ty than that of the general population; 
the risk increased with increasing severit y of the disease (Gladman, 2008 ; Rosen, 2012; Sokoll, 
2001) . 
1.2. Compound Background 
1.2.1. Apremilast
Apremilast (CC -10004) i s an oral  phosphodi esterase enzyme (PDE) inhibitor. It is highly 
select ive for PDE4, whi ch is the dominant PDE in inflammatory  cells. Through inhibit ingPDE4, 
apremilast elevates intracellular cyclic adenosine mo nophosphate levels , leading to a parti al 
inhibit ion of the production of many pro -inflammatory mediators , as well as an increase in so me 
anti
-inflammatory  mediators. Indeed, a recent study  in subj ects wi th PsA indicated that 
apremilast was associated with reductions in tumor necrosi s factor –(TNF -), interleukin ( IL) -
17, IL -23, IL -6, IL -8, macrophage inflammatory protein- 1β, and monocy te chem oattractant 
protein 1 , as well as increases in ant i-inflammatory mediators, including IL -10 and the IL -1 
receptor antagonist (Schafer, 2015). I t is believed , therefore, that apremilast exerts its therapeutic 
benefits through the modulat ion of mult iple inflammatory  pathways.

Confident ial and Propri etary 21 CC-10004- PSA-014Amendment 4 Final: 04 May 2020Following a com prehensive clinical development prog ram, apremilast has been approved for the 
treatm ent of PsA and psori asis. It is under clinical investigat ion for the treatm ent of Behçet ’s 
syndro me and inflammatory  bowel  disease. 
Whether apremilast can impact the structural progressio n of PsA has yet to be addressed . In 
addition, the extent of its effects on axial imaging parameters remains to be characterized in 
subjects wi th axial PsA.  
1.2.2. Key Findings from Clinical Studies
The safet y and efficacy  of apremilast for the treatment of PsA were demonstrated i n a 
comprehensive clinical development program. Subjects enrolled in Phases 3 and 3b studies 
included disease -modifying antirheumat ic drug ( DMARD )-naïve, DMARDs -experienced, 
biologic-naïve ,and bio logic-experienced subjects The results from these studies 
indicated that apremila st is safe and effect ive, both as monotherapy  and in combinat ion with 
convent ional synt hetic DMARDs ( csDMARDs ).

Week 24 in Subjects With Prior csDMARDs and/or Biologic DMARDs
Apremilast was first evaluated in 3 mult icenter ,rando mized ,doubl e
-blinded , placebo -controlled,
Phase 3 pivotal studies (Studi es CC -10004- PSA-002 [Palace 1 ], CC- 10004- PSA- 003 [ Palace 2 ], 
and CC -10004- PSA- 004 [ Palace 3 ]) (Cutolo, 2016 ; Edwards, 2016 ; Kavana ugh, 2014 ).The 
studi es were similar lydesign ed. Adul t subject s with active PsA ( ≥ 3 swollen and ≥ 3 tender 
joints) despite pri or csDMARD and/or bio logic TNF therapy  were enrolled in the studies (TNF 
blockers efficacy  failures were limited to < 10% of subjects). Subjects were excluded if they  had 
previously failed > 3 agents for PsA or > 1 TNF inhibitor. Stable ba seline conco mitant 
methotrexate ( MTX [ ≤ 25 mg/week ]), sulfasalazine ( SSZ [≤ 2 g/day ]), leflunomide (LEF [≤ 20 
mg/day ]), low-dose oral  glucocorti coids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone a day), and/or 
nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were allowed during the trials. 
Inthe 3 piv otal studi es, 1493 subject s were randomized equally to placebo (N =496), apremilast 
(APR ) 20 twice per day  (BID) (N=500), or APR 30 BID (N = 497). Placebo subject s whose 
tender and swo llen jo int count s(TJC and SJC, respectively) had not improved by  20% were re -
rando mized 1:1 in a blinded fashio n to ei ther apremilast 20 mg or 30 mg twice daily at Week 16, 
while apremilast subject s rem ained on thei r initial treatm ent. 
All 3 studies achieved their primary  endpoint ( Table 2 );a stati stically significantly higher 
percentage of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment group ach ievedthe primary  endpoint of 
American Co llege of Rheumatology ( ACR )20 at Week 16 com pared wi th placebo. Apremilast 
was also associated with statist ically significant imp rovem ents in physical funct ion and 
improvements in skin manifestations at Week s16 and 24 among subjects with body surface area 
(BSA) for psori asis ≥ 3 % at baseline.

24 in S ubjects Naïve to csDMARD sand Biologic DMARD s
The efficacy of apremilast in subjects naïve to csDMARDs therapy was invest igated in a 
multicenter, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study  
(CC-10004- PSA- 005 
[Palace 4] ) (Wells, 2013 ).Subjects enro lled had a diagnosis of PsA for 3 months and act ive 
disease (defined by  ≥3 swollen and ≥3 tender j oints). Previous treatment with csDMARDs or 
biologics was not allowed. Subjects could receive stable doses of prednisone (equivalent to 
≤ 10 mg/day) and/or NSAIDs. The use of other csDMARDs, including MTX, SSZ, LEF, or 
biologics was prohibited during the trial. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, APR 20 
BID, or APR 30 BID treatment groups.  
In total , 527 subjects were randomized to the placebo (n =176), APR 20 BID (n =175), or APR 
30 BID (n = 176) group . Subjects whose TJCs and SJC s had not improved by ≥20% at Week 16 
were required to enter the early  escape ( EE) to blinded active treatment. Placebo subjects who 
met the EE criteria were re- randomized 1:1 in a blinded fashio n to APR 20 BID or APR 30 BID. 
Apremilast subjects remained on their init ial treatment.  
Astatistically significant ly higher percentage of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment group 
achiev edthe primary  endpoint of ACR 20 at Week 16 compared with placebo ( Table 3). 
Apremilast was also associated with statist ically significant improvements in physical funct ion

in Subjects With an I nadequate Response to 1 csDMARD sand Who Received 
Apremilast Monotherapy
The rapi d onset of efficacy  of apremilast m onotherapy in bio logic-naïve subject s who had 
received ≤1 csDMARD swas demo nstrated in the ACTIVE study (CC -10004- PSA- 006) ( Nash, 
2018), a Phase 3b mult icenter, parallel -group study  with 1 active treatm ent; overall treatment 
durati on was2 years. The study  rando mized 219 patients (APR 30 m g,n=110; placebo [ PBO],
n=109). At Week 16 (time o f the primary  endpoint), all subjects whose improvement was <10% 
in both tender and swollen jo int counts were eligible to enroll into an EE to active treatment with 
apremilast 30 mg BID. After 24 weeks of treatment, all subjects entered the active -treatm ent 
phase ,in which they received apremilast 30 mg BID. 
A separat ion in the proportion of ACR20 responders to APR versus PBO was noted at W eek 2 
(16.4% versus 6.4%; P=0.0252), the first Post-baseline Visit. Early onset of response to APR 
was observed across clinical assessments, with improvements in the Disease Act ivity Score 
(DAS )-28 C- reacti ve protein (CRP), SJC, HAQ- DI, enthesit is, and morning st iffness severit y. 
Dactylit is and skin res ponses were not assessed in CC -10004- PSA- 006.
A stati stically significant ly greater proportion of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment group 
achieved the primary endpo int of ACR 20 response at Week 16 compared to placebo. A 
nominally significant ly greater proportion of subjects in the APR 30 BID treatment group 
achieved an ACR 50 or ACR 70 response at Week 16 than in the placebo group (Table 5).

subjects who had a baseline GEI score of greater than 0. J oints temporarily or permanently inaccessible at baseline 
were excluded from joint count. For other unassessed joints at baselin e, the joint assessment at the Screening V isit,

1.2.2.1.4. Long -term Efficacy Data From Phase 3 Study CC -10004- PSA -002 (Palace 1)
The 5 -year e fficacy of apremilast in subject s with active PsA despite prior csDMARD and/or 
biologic anti -TNF therapy  was assessed using data from the Phase 3 Study  CC-
10004 -PSA-002 
(Palace 1) (TNF blockers efficacy failures were limited to < 10% of subjects). Data were based 
on observed analyses fro m subjects who received apremilast 30 mg BID and who were still 
attending study  visits. 
ACR20/50/70 responses were achieved by  71.7%, 48.6% ,and 28.4% of subjects , respectively,
attending the Week 260 Visit(Kava naugh, 2018 ).Psori asis Area and Severit y Index ( PASI ) 50 
and 75 were achieved by 69.4% and 46.9% of subjects , respectively . At Week 260, 61.5% of the 
subjects achieved HAQ -DI improvements >0.3, which corresponds to the minimal clinically 
important diff erence (MCID) (Mease, 2004).
Apremilast was also associated with sustained responses and improvements in enthesit is and 
dactylit is amo ng subjects still attending study  visits. At 5 years, 54.5% of subjects achieved a 
Maastri cht Ankylo sing Spondylit is Enthesit is Score of 0 and 80% achieved a dactylit is count

The safet y data from  the Pal ace 1, 2, 3 ,and 4 studies were pooled and summarized for the first 
16 weeks of exposure to placebo or apremilast (Celgene, 2017 ; Wells, 2013).
The analyses 
conducted on the ap remilast popul ation include dsubjects started on apremilast at baseline and 
subjects switched fro m placebo to apremilast at Weeks 16 or 24. Analysis included all data 
during the time subjects were exposed to apremilast, regardless of the time apremilast ex posure 
started .
Approximately  half of the subjects (50.7%) experienced 1 treatm ent-emergent adverse event 
(TEAE )during the first 16 weeks of exposure to apremilast. The incidence of TEAE was higher 
among subjects who received apremilast thanplacebo (42.9%) ( Table 8). The m ost frequent ly 
reported TEAEs were diarr hea, nausea, headache, and upper respirato ry tract infect ion. The 
subject incidence of diarrhea, nausea, and headache was higher in the APR 30 BID group than in 
the APR 20 BID gr oup, suggesting a dose effect.

1.8%), headache (7.3% v ersus 3.7%), hy pertensi on (6.4% versus 6.4%), and diarrhea (subject -or 
investigator -reported) (14.7% v ersus 11.0%); using a protocol -defined characterizat ion of 
diarrhea ( ≥2 watery /liquid stool s/day), overall incidence was lower for APR and placebo (11.0 % 
and 8.3%). Serious AEs were lower with APR than placebo (2.8% v ersus 4.6%). No 
opportunist ic infect ions, reactivations of tubercul osis ( TB), or cases of marked depressio n were 
seen. In general, no increase was seen in AE incidence/severit y with longer -term exposure to 
APR up to 52 weeks. Apremilast was generally well tolerated.
The l ong-term safet y of apremilast , with or wi thout concomitant csDMARDs, over 4 y ears was 
assessed in a pooled analysis o f the Pal ace 1, 2 ,and 3 studies (Mease, 2017
).Results fro m this 
analysis suggested a favorable and consistent safety  profile over time. Im portantly, the frequency  
of gastrointest inal AEs decreased with longer exposure to apremilast, and the fre quency of other 
commo n AEs either decreased or remained stable with prolonged exposure ( Table 10). The rates 
of infect ions didnot increase over time, nor did the data indicate a need for specific laboratory  
monitoring. Treatm ent wi th apremilast was associated with an increase in adverse reac tions of  
depressio n;0.3% (4/1441) of subject s treated wi th apremilast di scont inued treatment due to 
depressio n or depressed mood versus 0placebo -treated subject s (0/495). Depression was 
reported as ser ious in 0.2% (3/1441) of subject s exposed to apremila stversus 0 placebo -treated 
subjects (0/495). Two subject s who received placebo committed suicide versus
0 apremilast -

1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
1.3.1.1. Unmet Medical Need 
In 2016, the European League Against Rheumat ism and the Group for Research and Assessment 
of Psori asis and Psori atic Arthritis (GRAPPA) published updated recommendat ions for the 
management of PsA. The GRAPPA recommendations are based on the following goals of 
therapy : 1) To achieve the lowest possible level o f disease act ivity; 2) To optimize functional 
status and improve QoL, and prevent structural damage, and 3) To avoid or minimize 
complicat ions, both fro m untreated active disease and fro m therapy . 
Apremilast has been extensively invest igated for the treatment of PsA. It is associated with 
improvements in clinical outcomes across several core PsA domains, physical function and QoL.
However, its impact on imaging outcomes associated with structural  progressi on in patients with 
PsA remains to be determined. In addit ion, the extent of its effects on axial parameters remains 
to be characterized in subjects with axial PsA.
Importantly, recent studies have failed to demonstrate substant ial radiographic pro gressions in 
most PsA subjects studied over short periods of time (Gladman, 1995a ; Gladman, 1995b ; 
Quei ro-Silva, 2003). These studies enro lled subjects who were at high risk for structural disease 
progression, such as pat ients with 3swollen jo ints, elevated CRP ,and evidence of erosive 
disease of peri pheral  jointsat 
baseline. Subjects were treated with bio logics orJanus kinase 
(JAK)inhibitors, or were receiving placebo. Taken together, th e limited amount of radiographic 
progression observed in these studies may reflect a change in the expressio n of the disease over 
time, which can be explained by improvements in the care of PsA . This m ay also highlight the 
limitations of convent ional radiographic imaging to assess structural changes.
1.3.1.2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in PsA and Study Rational e
Magnet ic resonance imagi ng (MRI) has gained importance as a promising tool for early  
diagnosis and increasing acceptance as an outcome measure in clinical trials of different 
inflammatory  arthri tides(Ostergaard, 2009 ; Weber, 2007
; Weber, 2009). It is highly sensit ive
(Althoff, 2007 ; Braun, 2004; Hermann, 2005 ; Hermann, 2006 )and superi or to convent ional 
radiography  in depicting inflammatory  bone l esions of  peripheral  arthri tis and theaxial  skeleton. 
Moreover, it can detect soft ti ssue inflammat ion, bone erosion ,and proliferation. Since there is 
lack of io nizing radiat ion, an MRI is also well suit ed for y oung pat ients and repetit ive follow-up 
exams.
Results fro m studi es in RA indicate that bone marrow edema (BME) is a predictor of erosive 
progression. A similar relat ionship is also suggested in PsA ( Poggenborg, 2015c ).Indeed, a close 
relationship between erosions and BME was found i n a cross -sectional MRI study  of erosive PsA 
patients. These data suggest that BME is a “forerunner ”of structural  joint dam age in PsA (Tan, 
2009). In a 48 -week longitudinal study  of PsA patients, BME detected by  MRI predi cted 
subsequent erosive progression as detected by  computed tomography (relative risk of erosion 
progression of 10 [95% CI ,2.1-
49] versusjoints wit hout BME ) (Poggenborg, 2014).

Protocol  CC-10004- PSA- 014 Amgen Inc.
Confident ial and Propri etary 35 CC-10004- PSA-014Amendment 4 Final: 04 May 2020The potential use of MRI to monitor treatment outcomes has encouraged research in this field. In 
2015, the Outcom e Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT )Psoriat ic Arthri tis Magnetic 
Resonance Im aging Score (PsAMRIS) was validated in a ran domized pl acebo -controlled tri al 
with 40subject s who received placebo or abatacept for 6 months. The results showed numerical 
improvements in the inflammatory  variables of PsAMRIS, with high responsiveness ,especially  
for synovit is and tenosynovit is, during abatacept but not placebo therapy . The scoring system
(Glinatsi, 2015 )assesses metacarpophalangeal, proxim al interphalangeal ,and distal 
interphalangeal joints of fingers 2 to 5, quantifying synovit is (score 0 -3), flexor tenosynovit is 
(score 0 -3), periarticular inflammat ion (absent o r present), bone edema (score 0 -3), bone erosion 
(score 0 -10), and bone pr oliferation/enthesophy tes (absent or present). The PsAMRIS is a new 
outcom e measure for clinical trials (Coates, 2012 )
.The scoring system provides an object ive 
measure of disease activit y, being able to i dentify responses earlier than clinical assessments. 
Poggenborg ,et al (Poggenborg, 2014 )showed that MR I is useful  in quantifying improvements in 
tenosynovit is, synovit is,and osteit is after treatm ent wi th an anti -TNF agent. In con trast, in the 
same tri al, MRI scores of periart icular inflammat ion did not chang esignificant ly after 24 weeks .
As a result, the impact of apremilast on the PsAMRIS composite score of BME, synovit is,and 
tenosynovit is was chosen as the primary endpo int of this study , due to itssensit ivity to change in 
response to treatment.
Dynamic contrast -enhanced MRI (DCE -MRI) is a dist inctMRI technique that quantifies the 
patterns of enhancement within pre -determined r egions of interest, after inject ion ofintravenous 
contrast agent (Cimmino, 2012 ).Such dynamic imaging allows t hecapture of the tissue 
vascularit y and quantif iesthe inflammat ion in the studied jo int. It has been validated in RA for 
measuring inflammat ion, but has been used less frequent ly in studi es in PsA. It seems to be a 
sensit ive tool to assess inflammat ion in PsA, correlating significantly wit h PsAMRIS total 
inflammat ion score (Poggenborg, 2012). In thi s study , DCE -MRI will be performed in the most 
affected hand as an opti onal assessment . Furthermore, we aim to compare standard MRI and 
DCE -MRI for monitoring inflammat ion, determining differences in responsiveness between 
both. 
Undoubtedly, p hysical examinat ion is the basis of clinical evaluat ion. Nevertheless, the routine 
clinical e xam, especially  of enthesit is, is often inconclusi ve, making the decisio n to init iate or 
adapt therapy  very  difficul t. Therefore, m ore obj ective methods demonstrating inflammat ion at 
tendons, ligaments ,and fascia at their insertion in bone and/or the adjacent soft tissue are needed
(Poggenborg, 2015a ).However, standard MRI can only be used to scan a small anatomical area 
at a time. This is a limitation when assessing PsA, which has a heterogeneous phenoty pe, being 
diverse and widespread in terms of disease manifestations. Whole-body  MRI (Althoff, 2007 )
(WB -MRI) is a pro mising method for improving enthesit is assessment by evaluat ing all entheses 
from “head -to-toe” in one examinat ion (Mager, 2009 ; Meaney, 2010 ).A prospective, cross -
sectional pilot study  of patients wi th PsA (n=18) and axial SpA (n=18) by  Poggenborg and 
colleagues showed that enthesit is can be detected on WB -MRI ,with moderate agreem ent 
between WB -MRI and clinical examinat ion at the entheseal level (Poggenborg, 2015a ).Itis 
important to emphasize that, although clinical examinat ion is considered the gold standard, 
previous studies have documented a moderate reliabilit y of clinical assessment among 
rheumatol ogists wi th experti se in SpA. This undoubtedly  cont ributes to the lack of associat ion 
with MRI findings (Gladman, 2007 ).Poggenborg ’s study  showed that enthesit is was frequently

inserti ons. Moreover, by  performing WB -MRI, it may be possible to different iate between 
enthesit is and fibro myalgia, enabling the rheumatologist to choose the appropriate treatment
(Weckbach, 2011).
Involvement of the axial skeleton is a characteristic feature of spondylo arthri tis (SpA) . Itis 
present in between 25% (early  disease and clinical assessment only ) and 75% (l ate di sease and 
sophist icated imaging) of PsA patients, wi th an impact as great as that 
seen in ankylosing 
spondylit is(Jadon, 2017). MRI is widely accepted as the mos t sensit ive imaging modalit y to 
detect early  inflammatory  lesions of  the axial skeleton (Weber, 2008). WB-MRI iscapable o f 
detecting axial invo lvement in PsA patients, because it evaluates mult iple possib le areas of 
involvement in a single procedure. WB -MRI has been validated against standard MRI for 
scoring acute inflammatory  lesions in the sacro iliac joints of 32 SpA patients with established 
and act ive disease (30 had primary ankylosing spondyli tis and 2 had Crohn’ s disease, all 
fulfilling the modified New York criteria) (Weber, 2009 ).Results showed a strong cor relation 
and co mparable reliabilit y for the detecti on of  inflammatory  lesions. 
Thus , although rel atively new, WB -MRI i s a very  promising tool  for the assessment of disease 
activit y and dam age in PsA, wi th significant potential as a measure of the overall burden of the 
disease (Ostergaard, 2017 ; Poggenborg, 2015b ).As a result , WB -MRI will be used in the current 
study  to assess the impact of apremilast on MRI parameters of axial jo intsin subjects wi th 
suspected axial PsA. Its impact on enthes esand peri pheral  joints will also be invest igated.
The concept that MRI more accurate ly identifies clinically relevant synovit is than clinical 
assessment i s well  established. One hypothesis for why MRI might be a useful predictive 
biomarker for clinical response is that some patients may have elevated disease activit y measures 
driven by co morbid condi tions, rather than so lely by  active j oint inflammat ion (Baker, 2017 ).
Conversely , pati ents wi th greater MRI -detected activit y might be expected to have a big 
proporti on of  their clinical  disease activit y explained by  active PsA. Finally, since the evidence 
for the prognostic value of MRI in PsA is st ill scarce (Mathew, 2017), this study  intends to 
investigate the correlat ion between specific imaging features and structural progression in this 
popul ation.
1.3.2. Rationale for the S tudy Design
Psori atic arthritis may vary fro m a mild nonprogressive oligoarthritis to severe polyarticular 
disease, wi th great di sabili ty and reduced qualit y of life.  These diverse clinical manifestations 
undermine general predict ions regarding outcomes. Although PsA has been historically 
conceived as a more benign arthropathy , in som e pati ents i t follows a parti cularly  aggressive and 
deforming course. Hence, early  diagnosis and treatment may  have a significant beneficial effect 
on the natural course of this disease.
This study  is designed to determine the impact of apremilast on imaging outcomes, assessed by 
both MRI of the m ost affected hand and WB -MRI, in bi ologic-naïve subjects wi th active PsA, 
with ≥ 3 m onths and ≤ 5 yearsof disease durati on, who had inadequate response to 2 or less 
csDMARD s. The purpose of the single- arm design of this tri al is to ob tain pre liminary evidence 
of the impact of apremilast on MRI outcom es and structural  progressi on of  the di sease.

Confident ial and Propri etary 37 CC-10004- PSA-014Amendment 4 Final: 04 May 2020A placebo -controlled study  was not deem ed necessary  since current evidence in the lit erature 
shows that inflammat ion, as assessed by MRI, is not expected to significant ly improve without 
an intervent ion in PsA. Moreover, a comparison arm wit h methotrexate was not pu rsued as the 
efficacy  of MTX in PsA has not been convincingly proven in a randomized placebo -controlled 
trial. 
1.3.3. Rationale for Dose, S chedule and Regimen Selection
After a dose titration over a 5- dayperiod, an oral  dose of apremilast 30 mg BID will be given to 
all subjects. This is the approved dosing regimen of apremilast for the treatment of PsA.
In the Phase 3 PsA studies, a statistically significant ly greater proportion of subjects in the 
apremilast 30 mg BID treatment group achieved the primary  endpoint of ACR 20 response at 
Week 16 versusplacebo. The statist ically significant ACR 20 responses observed at Week 16 
were m aintained at Week 24 in the APR 30 BID group in all 3 pivotal  studies. Therefore, the 24 -
week treatm ent peri od wi th frequent visits and assessments will provide adequate time to 
reasonably  assess the effect of apremilast on clinical parameters and subject -reported outcomes , 
but especially on inflammatory  and bony  lesions classically associated with PsA, as assessed by 
MRI. This is als o consistent wi th the design of clinical trials that 
evaluated the effect of bio logic 
drugs in subjects with PsA through MRI assessments that have selected their primary endpo ints 
at W eek 24 in order to assess efficacy . The l ong-term effects of apremilast will be evaluated at 
Week 48. Indeed, results from the above -mentioned studi es indicate that a longer follow -up is 
needed to detect changes in erosions with MRI .

3.1. Study Design
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the International Council on Harmo nisat ion 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharma ceuticals for Hum an Use/Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory  requi rements. For all regio ns, the l ocal 
Regulatory  Label  must be fo llowed. 
This is a Phase 4 , multicenter, single -arm, open -label study  to eval uate the impact of apremilast,
either in mo notherapy  or wi th stable MTX, on MRI outcomes in subjects with act ive PsA with 
up to 5years of disease duration (since diagnosis).
Approximately  120 subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg BID , after a 5 -day titration period,
with or wi thout stabl e MTX. All subjects will be permitted to take NSAIDs and/or low -dose oral  
glucocorti coids (predniso ne ≤ 10 m g/day  or equivalent) throughout the study .The NSAIDs and 
low-dose oral  glucocorti coidsmust be on a stable regimen for at leas t 4 weeks pri or to baseline. 
MTX (≤25 m g/week) will be permitted if treatm ent durati on is ≥6 months and on a stabl e 
regimen for at least 3months prior to baseline. In addit ion, the stable doses of MTX, NSAIDs ,
and low -dose glucocortico ids must be cont inued from  Day  1through the W eek 24 Visit. Change 
in doses, increase or decrease, and/or discontinuation will not be allowed ,except for safet y 
reasons or for lack of availabilit y. After the Week 24 Visit, the doses of MTX, NSAIDs ,or 
glucocorti coids may beadjusted as clinically required.
This is a 56- week study  which will consist of 3 phases ,as shown in Figure 1:
Screening Phase –up to 4 weeks
Single-arm, 
Open-label Treatm ent Phase –Weeks 0 to 48
120 s ubjects will receive apremilast 30 mg BID (after a 5 -daytitration peri od) for 
the ent ire durati on of  this phase
All subjects who complete the study  or di scont inue early will part icipate in the 4 -
week Post-treatm ent Observational Follow-up P hase. Henceforth, this will be referred 
to as the Observational Fo llow-up Phase.

The fo llowing procedures will be conducted as outlined in the Table of Events, Section 5.
6.1. Screening P eriod
Screening evaluat ions will be performed for all subjects to determine study  eligibilit y. These 
evaluat ions m ust be com pleted wi thin 28days of first dosing unless noted 
otherwise below. 
Waivers to the protocol will not be granted during the conduct of this trial, under any 
circumstances.
Safety laboratory  analyses and all assessm ents will be performed centrally . Screening l aboratory  
values must demonstrate subject eligibilit y, but m ay be repeated wi thin the screening window ,if 
necessary .
Chest radiography can be performed at the invest igator’s discretion, however it is not required as 
per protocol.
The fo llowing will be performed at screening as specified in the Table of Events, after informed 
consent has been obtained:
Inclusio n/Exclusio n criteria
Medical history  (including specific i nformat ion regarding diagnosis and additional 
needed details )
Dem ographics (include year of birth, sex, race, and ethnicit y-if allowed by  local 
regul ations)
Prior disease therapi es: includes surgery ,systemic or any  other therapy  for the subject ’s 
disease
Com plete m edical history  (all relevant medical condit ions diagnosed/ occurrin g prior to 
screening should also be included)

6.3.1. Safety Follow -up
All subjects will be fo llowed f or 28 day s after the last dose of IP for AE reporting, as well as any 
SAEs m ade known to the Invest igator at any time following the protocol -requi red reporti ng 
period or after end of study t, as described in Section 10.1.Safet y assessments are specified in 
the Table o f Events, Table 13.
6.4. Efficacy Assessment s
The fo llowing assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Table of Events, Section 5.
6.4.1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
The MRI assessments will be conducted fo llowing the procedures outlined in the MRI manual, at 
scheduled visits according to Section 5(Tabl e of Events). The clinical and the MRI assessments 
shoul d be perform ed on the sam e day , with the MRI scans always performed after the clinical 
visit. Except ionally , MRI scans can be performed within 7 days after the clinical assessments. 
The baseline MRI must be performed within 7 days after the first administration o f IP. The 
subsequent MRIs shoul d be perform edat Week 24 + 7 day s and Week 48 + 7days. All MRI 
visits should be scheduled well in advance to allo w for proper planning. In addit ion, it is 
recommended to schedule 2 MRI visits (an init ial and a repeat vi sit) for each MRI time point i n 
order to be assured of a high -quali ty MRI scan at each protocol -specified time point. The init ial 
and repeat MRI visits should be scheduled approximately 7 to 14 days apart to allow enough 
time for confirmation of qualit y scans from the initial MRI. If the init ial MRI scans are of 
acceptable qualit y, then the scheduled repeat MRI session can be canceled.
All MRI technicians will receive training on specific MRI posit ioning and jo int placement , 
further details of which are provided in the Study  Procedures Manual. The MRI technician will 
ensure the qualit y of each MRI pri or to the subject leaving the radio logy facility.
The adjudication of the results, when two readers are invo lved, will be done through the 
consensus procedure between the two readers. The readers will be able to share the screen and 
discuss the data, then amend the final scoring. All data, the original an d the consented results 
will be recorded and stored in the imaging database and later incorporated into the clinical 
database to be available for statist ical analysis.

The Pati ent’s (Subject ’s) and Physician’s ( Evaluator ’s) Global Assessments of Disease Act ivity 
are assessments of how active a subject ’s PsA was on average during the past week. Both, 
subjects and evaluator s should mark the box with an X on a 0- to-
10-unit numeric rating scale 
(NRS) ,on which the left -hand box of 0 represents “not active,” and the right -hand box represents 
“very act ive” ( Appendix D; Felso n, 1995; Sieper, 2009 ).
6.4.5.3. Subject ’s Pain Numeric Rating Scale 
The pain NRS is the subject ’s assessment of how much pain he/she had, on average, during the 
past week in his/her jo ints due to PsA. The subject will be asked to mark the box with an X on a 
0-to 10 -unit NRS ,on which the left -hand box of 0 represents “no pain,” and the right -hand box 
represents the “ pain as bad as y ou can imagine ”

Enthesit is, or the inflammat ionof the si tes where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone, is a 
prominent clinical manifestation in subjects withPsA. In this study , 2 clinical indices will be 
used to evaluate entheseal inflammat ion.The Leeds Enthesit is Index ( Appendix F; Healy , 
2008b )will be assessed through physical examinatio n of the fo llowing sites. Tenderness (y es/no) 
will be assessed at 6 sites of tendon insertions (0 -6) as depicted below: 
Lateral  epicondyle, l eft and ri ght
Medial  femoral condyle, l eft and ri ght
Achilles tendon insert ion, left and right
Tenderness on physical examinat ion is recorded as either present ( 1) or absent (0) for each of the 
6 sites, for an overall score range of 0 to 6. Higher count represents a greater enthesit is burden.
The SPARCC Enthesi tis Index (Appendix G) will  be assessed through physical examinat ion of 
the following si tes:
Medial epicondyle (left/right [L/R] )
Lateral  epicondyle (L/R)
Supraspinatus insertion into greater tuberosit y of hum erus (L/R)
Greater trochanter (L/R)
Quadri ceps inserti on into superi or border of patella (L/R)
Patellar ligament insert ion into inferior pole of patella or tibial tubercle (L/R)
Achilles tendon in sertion into cal caneum (L/R)
Plantar fascia insertion into calcaneum (L/R)
Tenderness on examinat ion is recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 16 sites, 
for an overall score range of 0–
16. Hi gher count represents greater enthesit is burden.

Dactylit is (“sausage digit”) is characterized by the swelling o f the ent ire finger or toe. It will be 
assessed using the Leeds Dact ylitis Index ( LDI) (Appendix H;Helliwell, 2005 ).
The score is a function of finger circumference and tenderness, assessed and summed across all 
dactylit ic digits.
6.4.5.9. Clinical Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (c -DAPSA)
The c -DAPSA is a measure of PsA disease act ivity, associated with funct ional and structural 
outcom es(Aletaha, 2017). It will be perform ed programmat ically by summing four disease 
activit y variables: TJC andSJC, subject global and pain assessment. Cut-offsfor cDAPSA are:
≤ 4: remissio n
>4 and ≤
13: low disease act ivity
>13 and ≤
27: moderate disease act ivity
>
27: high disease activit y. 
6.4.5.10. Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS)
ThePASDAS is a weighted index comprising assessments of jo ints, fun ction, acute phase 
response, QoL,and patient and physician visual analogue scores (VAS) (Coates, 2014 ). 
Note: This study  does not utilize VASs, but rather NRSs. The patient’s and physician’s global 
assessment of disease act ivity captured on a NRS will be mult iplied by  a factor of 10 to derive 
the VAS, used to calculate PASDAS.
The calculat ion of the PASDAS will be performed programma tically  using the form ula bel ow:
PASDAS =(((0.18× √physician global VAS)+(0.159×√pat ient global 
VAS) −(0.253×√SF36−PCS)+(0.101×LN (SJC +1))+(0.048×LN (TJC +))+(0.23×LN (Leeds 
enthesit is count+1))+(0.377 LN (dactylit is count+1))+(0.102× LN (CRP+1))+2)*1.5.
CRP = C- reactive protein; LN = natural logarithm ;PCS = physical component summary scale of SF36 ;SF36 = 
Medical Outcomes Study Short Form -36; SJC = swollen joint count; TJC = tender joint count; VAS = visual 
analogue scale . All VAS scores are 0–100 mm. Swo llen joint count is 66 joints, and tender joint count 68. 
The score range of the PASDAS is 0 –10, wi th worse di sease activit y represented by  higher 
scores. Response criteria for the Psoriat ic Arthri tis Disease Act ivity Score (PASDAS) i s detailed

The BASDAI is a composite score based on a subject se lf-administered survey  of six questions 
using a 0 -to 10 -unit NRS that assesses the subject ’s five m ajor symptoms rel evant to 
spondylo arthropathi es: 1) fatigue; 2) spinal pain; 3) peripheral jo int pain/swelling; 4) areas of 
localized tenderness; 5) morning st iffness severit y upon wakening; 6)morning st iffness duration 
upon wakening ( Appendix J; Calin, 1999 ; Sieper, 2009 ). The subjec t will  be asked to m ark wi th 
an X a 0-to 10 -unit NRS for each of the six quest ions. T o give each of the five symptoms equal 
weighting, the mean of the two scores relat ing to morning st iffness is taken. The result ing 0 to 50 
score i s divided by 5 to give a final 0 to 10 BASDAI score. A BASDAI score of 4 or greater is 
considered to be indica tive of act ive disease.
6.5. Safety Assessments
In addit ion to daily  safety  monitoring conducted by  invest igators and individual study  personnel, 
AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), discont inuat ions and laboratory findings will be reviewed

Baseline Visit at the site. Urine pregnancy test kit will be provided by the central laboratory.
Pregnancy tests shoul d be performed if the FCBP subject has missed a menstrual period or the 
contraception method has changed.
In addit ion to the assessments specified in Section5,the Invest igator will fo llow country  
guidelines regarding the monitoring of pregnancy  testing at any  scheduled or unscheduled visit 
and will document the test result in the source document.  At the discret ion of the Invest igator, a 
serum  pregnancy  may be done.
6.5.2. Vital Signs, Height and Weight
Vital signs, including temperature, pulse, and seated blood pressure, will be taken during the 
visits indicated in Section 5, Tabl e of Events. Height wi ll be m easured and recorded at s creening; 
weight will be measured and recorded at every visit.
In the event of u nexplained and clinically significant weight loss, subjects should be evaluated and
discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent shoul d be considered by  the invest igator.
6.5.3. Complete/Limited Physical Examination
A co mplete physical examinat ion includes evaluations of s kin, nasal cavit ies, eyes, ears, lymph 
nodes, and respiratory , cardi ovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal 
system s.A co mplete p hysical examinat ion is done at s creening and other designated visits as 
indicated in Section 5.A limited physical examination includes eval uations of skin, lymph 
nodes, and respiratory , cardi ovascular, and m usculoskel etal systems. A limited physical 
examinat ion is done at Baseline Visit and other designated visit s as indicated in Section 5.
6.5.4. Psychiatric Evaluation
Treatment with apremilast is associated with an increase in adverse react ions of depressio n. 
Before using apremilast in subjects with a history  of depressio n and/or suicidal thoughts or 
behavior , the invest igator should carefully weigh the risks and benefit s of treatment with 
apremilast in such patients. Subjects should be advise d of the need to be alert for the emergence 
or worsening o f depressio n, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur 
to con tact the Invest igator . 
If a patient suffers fro m new or worsening psychiatric symptoms, or suicidal ideat ion or suicidal
attem pt is i dentified, it is reco mmended to discontinue study treatment (see Secti on11).
6.5.5. Diarrhea, Nausea and Vomiting
Apremilast has been associated with AE reports of diarrhea in clinical trials. Most diarrhea 
events were of mild or moderate severit y and reported wi thin the f irst 2 weeks of treatment, 
usually reso
lving within 4 weeks wit hout m edical intervent ion.
Diarrhea is the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day , or m ore frequent ly than is 
norm al for the individual ( World Heal th Organizatio n [WHO], 2013). F ollowing the definit ion of 
diarrhea by the WHO and taking a more conservat iveapproach, the AE of diarrhea i n this 
protocol  is defined as having two or more watery /liquid stool s in a day .

of Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) preferred term o f diarrhea, subjects repor ting diarrhea or 
similar events (eg, frequent bowel movements, loose bowels, etc.) will be asked whether they 
have had two or more watery /liquid stool s in a day. Subj ects who respond “yes” to this question 
will be further asked how often, on average, have they experienced two or more watery /liquid 
stools in a day . Subjects who respond “no” to the question will not be asked any  further 
questions.
There have been post -marketing reports of severe diarrhea, nausea and vo miting associated with 
the use of apremil ast. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some 
cases, patients were hospitalized. 
Subjects 65 years of age or older and those taking medicat ions that can lead to volume deplet ion 
or hy potensi on may be at a higher risk of compli cations. Subjects should be mo nitored for the 
occurrence of severe diarrhea, nausea and vo miting.  If subject s develop severe diarrhea, nausea 
and vo miting, discont inuation o f treatm ent wi th study  treatm ent m ay be necessary  (see 
Secti on11).
6.5.6. Tuberculosis 
After an extensive clinical development program, there is no current evidence that apremilast has 
the potenti al to activate l atent TB. Therefore, no TB testing will be done in this protocol. 
Invest igators can test for TB if clinically indicated, using the site ’s local or country  specific 
guidelines. If t he subject has active or latent TB, he/she should be treated according to local 
guidelines. Subjects who require TB treatment at any  time during the study  must be 
discontinued. 
6.5.7. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Clinical laboratory  evaluat ions will be perfor med by the central laboratory , and as indicated in 
Secti on 5.Clinical laboratory  eval uations include : RF, CBC (RBC count, hemoglobin, 
hematocri t, WBC count and differential, abso lute WBC counts, platelet count); serum 
chemistries (total protein, album in, calcium, phosphorous, glucose, triglycerides, total 
cholesterol  [TC], total  and di rect bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST ,ALT ], sodi um, potassi um, 
chloride, bicarbonate [carbon dioxide, CO 2], BUN , creati nine, creat inine clearance, lactate

(specific gravit y, pH, glucose, ketones, protein, blo od, bilirubin, leukocy te esterase, ni trite, and 
urobilinogen). Urinalysis will be performed by the central laboratory; microscopi c urinalysis 
(epithelial cells, RBC, WBC, and casts) will be performed only  if the urinalysis is abnormal. 
6.5.8. Adverse Events
All subjects will be mo nitored for adverse events (AEs) during the study . Assessments m ay 
include mo nitoring of any or all the foll owing parameters: the subject ’s clinical symptoms, 
laboratory , 
pathol ogical, radi ological, or surgical findings; physical examinat ion findings; or 
other appropriate tests and procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by  the invest igator fro m the time the subject signs informed consent to

7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
Tablets will be taken by mouth twice daily, in the mor ning (AM) and in the evening (PM), 
approximately  12 hours apart, wi th no food restri ctions.To mit igate potenti al gastrointestinal  
(GI) adverse events, dose titration shall be implemented over a 5 -dayperiod(Table 14).At the 
Week 0 Vis
it, subjects will be dispensed a blister card with 10, 20, and 30 mg apremilast tablets 
for the dose titration. Subjects will be dispensed bottles wit h 30 m g apremilast tablets at 
designated visits.

not permissible in this study , if a subject develops severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
of less than 30 m L per minute estimated by  the Cockroft –Gaul t equati on), interrupti on of  study  
medicat ionis required.
7.2.1. Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, applies to protocol -requi red dosing of the IP(s) only.
Therefore, for a drug to be subject to the overdose definit ion it must be both required and an
investigational drug. In this study the only requi red and investigational drug is apremilast and 
there is no control arm drug, hence overdose definition will apply to only apremilast. Other 
requi red or opti onal non -study  drugs intended for prophylaxis of certain side effects, etc, are 
excluded fro m this definit ion.

least 4 weeks prior to Baseline Visit [i e, Day  1]).
Note: The stable dose of glucocorti coids must be con tinued and maintained from Day 
1through the W eek 24 Visit. Change in doses, increase or decrease, and/or 
discontinuat ion of glucocorti coids will not be allo wed except for safet y reasons or for 
lack of availabilit y. After the Week 24 Visit, the dose of glucocorti coids may be 
adjusted as clinically required.
MTX (≤ 25 m g/week, if total treatm ent durati on is ≥ 6 m onths and on a stable dose
for at least 3months prior to baseline ).
At Week 12, subject s will be allowed to receive IA glucocortico ids, administrati on of  
up to 2 injecti ons of  ≤ 40 m g triamcino lone hexacetonide or equivalent (each jo int). 
NSAIDs or narcotic analgesics (must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to

are permitted and must be recorded in the subject ’s source docum ents and as a concomit ant 
medicat ion on the CRF.
The fo llowing therapy  will be permitted after the Week 24 V isitfor subjects with worsening 
arthri tic symptom s of PsA:
Change of NSAID ty pe and/or dose
Administrati on of  no m ore than 40 m g intram uscular (IM) or intra-articular ( IA)
glucocorti coid(triamcino lone hexacetoni de or equivalent) at a single visit, up to 
Week 36 , not to exceed two glucocortico id IM and/or IA administrations in any  6 
month-interval. Injected jo ints shoul d not be counted during the visits that will take 
place wi thin 4 weeks of the intra -articular inject ion.
Short course ( ≤ 2 weeks) of low-dose oral glucocorti coids(prednisone ≤ 10 m g/day 
or equivalent) , to be completed up to Week 36 and not to exceed one course in a 6 -
monthinterval
In order to minimize the impact on ongoing efficacy assessments, the invest igator should use the 
least intensive regimen to ameliorate the s ubject ’s worsening PsA symptoms. After Week 24, if 
subjects exper ience a decrease in PsA clinical disease activit y, the invest igator may opt to taper 
the background treatment; however, only one agent may be reduced or tapered at any  one time. 
After the first agent ’s taper has been co mpleted (not required to be zero), th e dose m ust be stable 
for at least 4 weeks pri or to starti ng the taper of the next agent. Subjects are recommended to 
have a reduction of background therapy  in the fo llowing order: first MTX, second 
glucocorti coids and thi rd NSAIDs or other pain medicat ion. If clinically indicated, the 
investigator may  opt to reduce the m edicat ions in a different order. Any  further 
questions/concerns regarding dose reductions can be discussed wit h the Sponsor.
All other prohibited medicat ions listed in Sect ion 4.4(Exclusio n Cri teria) and Sect ion 8.2
(Prohibited Conco mitant Medi cations and Pro cedures) remain in effect through the end of the 
subject ’s parti cipat ion in the study .
8.2. Concomitant Medications Not Recommended
It has been observed that co -administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
enzyme inducer, rifampicin, resulted in a re ducti on of  systemic exposure of apremilast, which 
may result in a loss of efficacy  of apremilast. Therefore, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme

10.1. Monitoring, Recording ,and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any  noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury , or any  concomi tant impai rment of  the subject ’s heal th, including 
laboratory  test val ues (as specified by  the cri teria in Secti on10.3), regardl ess of eti ology. Any 
worsening (ie, any  clinically significant adverse change in the frequency  or intensi ty of a pre -
exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE /SAE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndro me. 
Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity or toxi city to apremilast should be reported as an AE. Overdose, 
accidental  or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE ,shoul d be reported on the 
overdose CRF. (See Section 7.2.1 for the definit ion of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental or 
intentional overdose of an IPwhich meets the definit ion of an adverse event should be reported 
as an AE on the CRF. If the se quela eof an overdose meet seriouscriteria, then it must be marked 
as serious on the CRF and the paper SAE Report form .The overdose itself shoul d not be 
reported as an AE .
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and shoul d receive 
supportive measures as necessary . There is no known specific ant idote for apremilast overdose. 
Actual  treatm ent shoul d depend on the severit y of the clinical situation and the judgment and 
experience o f the treating physician.
All subjects will b e monitored f or AEs during the study .Assessments may include monitoring of 
any or all o f the following parameters: the subject ’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , pathol ogical , 
radiological  or surgical  findings, physical examination findings, or findings fro m other tests 
and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by  the Investi gator f rom the time the subject signs informed consent 
until 28 days after the last dose ,as well as any SAEs made known to the I nvest igator at any  time 
following the protocol -requi redreporting period or after end of study  will also be reported for 
these subjects. All adverse events ( serious/non -serious) will be recorded on the CRF , the paper 
SAE Report form (SAEs) and in the subject ’s source docum ents. All SAEs m ust be reported to 
Amg en Gl obal Patient Safet ywithin 24 hours of the Invest igator ’s knowl edge of  the event by 
recording on the CRF and using the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form by  
facsimile/email of the paper SAE Report Form  directly to Am gen Gl obal Patient Safet y.
10.1.1. Monitoring, Recording ,and Reporting AEs of Diarrhea
The PDE4 inhibitors, including apremilast, have been associated with AE reports of diarrhea. To 
better characterize and understand all reported AEs of diarrhea, further information will be 
collected as described in Secti on5, in the Table of Events. Please refer to Secti on10.1 for further 
details on how to record such AEs.

A qualified Invest igator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any  AE occurring at any dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (i e, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE);
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on 
(hospi talizat ion is defined as an inpatient admissio n, regardl ess of l ength of stay );
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substant ial disrupt ion of the 
subject ’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect;
Const itutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately  life-
threatening or result in death, hospitalizat ion, or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizatio ns for:
astandard procedure for protocol therapy  administrati on.However, hospitalizat ion or 
prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of therapy  administrati on will be 
reported as an SAE. 
routine treatm ent or m onitoring of the studied indication not associated with any  
deteri oration in cond ition.
the administration o f blood or pl atelet transfusio n as routine treatment of studied 
indicat ion.However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
aprocedure for protocol/disease -related invest igations (eg, surgery , scans, endoscopy , 
sampling for laboratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling). However, hospitalizat ion or 
prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE.
hospitalizati on or prol ongati on of hospi talizati on for technical , practical , or s ocial 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
aprocedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
docum ented in the source document and the CRF. Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospi talizati on for a com plicati on remains a reportable SAE.

unrelated to the studied indicat ion, that has not worsened fro m baseline. 
emergency outpatient treatment or observat ionthat does not result in admissio n, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the paper SAE Report 
Form  must be completed. All SAEs must be reported to Amgen Glo bal Pat ient Safety within 24 
hours of the Investigator’s knowledge by  submi tting the paper SAE report form via 
facsimile/email directly to Amgen Glo bal Pat ient Safety.
For each AE, the Invest igator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship to apremilast , acti on taken regarding apremilast , and outcome.
10.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For each AE, the Invest igator must assess the severity/ intensit y of the event. 
Mild
Asymptomat ic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observat ions only
Intervention not indicated
Activities o f daily  life (ADLs) minimally or not affected
No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required 
Moderate 
Symptom (s) cause m oderate di scomfort
Local  or noninvasive intervent ion indicated
More than minimal interference wit h ADLs but able to carry  out daily  soci al and 
funct ional activit ies.
Drug therapy  may be requi red
Severe (could be non -serious or seri ous) 
Symptom s causing severe disco mfort/pain
Symptom s requi ring m edical/surgi cal attenti on/int ervent ion
Interference wit h ADLs i ncluding inabilit y to perf orm daily  soci al and funct ional 
activit ies (eg, absenteeism and/or bed rest)
Drug therapy  is requi red
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is notthe sam e as “serious ,” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated wi th events that pose a threat to a 
subject ’s life or funct ioning.
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.

Confident ial and Propri etary 82 CC-10004- PSA-014Amendment 4 Final: 04 May 202010.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f apremilast and 
the occurrence of an AE as Not Susp ected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic 
intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provi de a sufficient 
explanat ion for the ob served event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event. “Reasonable possibilit y”means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the IP and 
the adverse event.
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for e achAE based on current ly available information.
Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional  informat ion beco mes available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional non-
IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Amgen , please provi de the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
10.2.4. Duration
For each AE, the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with apremilast as a result of each AE, as applicable 
(eg, di scont inuat ionorinterruption, as appropriate) and report if conco mitant and/or addi tional 
treatm ents were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The Investig ator will report the outcome of the event for each AE.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject ’s parti cipat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory  value is considered an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of dose, or any  other therapeuti c 
intervent ion; or
is judged to b e of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicit y or is an exacerbat ion or worsening o f an exist ing

need to be document ed as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded asthe AE. If the abnormalit y was not a part of a diagnosis or 
syndro me, then the l aboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as the AE. If possible, the 
laboratory  abnorm ality shoul d be recorded as a m edical term  and not simply  as an abnorm al 
laboratory  resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Preg nanc y
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in a female subject of childbearing potential 
are immediately reportable events .  
10.4.1. Collection of Pregnancy and Infant Health Information
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-subunit of human chorionic
gonadotropin [β -hCG] or posit ive pregnancy test in a female subject of childbearing potential
regardl ess of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 28 days of the subject’s
last dose of IP, must be report able within 24 hours . Invest igational product is to be discont inued 
immediately  and the subject instructed to return any  unused porti on of  the IP to the investigator. 
The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or posit ive pregnancy test must be reported to Amgen
Global Patient Safet y immediately by facsimile, email or other appropriate method, using the 
Pregnancy Notificat ion Form or approved equivalent form ( refer to Appendix V).  The 
Pregnancy Notificat ion Form  must be submitted to Amgen Global Pat ient Safet y within 24 hours 
of learning of a subject’ s pregnancy . (Note:  Si tes are not requi red to provi de any  information on 
the Pregnancy Notificat ion Form that vio lates the country  or regi ons l ocal privacy laws). 
After obtaining the female subject ’s signed consent for release of pregnancy  and infant healt h 
inform ation, the invest igator will collect pregnancy and infant health info rmation and complete 
the pregnancy  questi onnai re for any  female subject who becomes pregnant while taking IP 
through 28 day s of the subject ’s last dose of IP . This informat ion will be forwarded to Amgen 
Global Patient Safety . Generally , infant follow -up wi ll be conducted 12 months after the birth of 
the child (if applicable).         
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician- gyneco logist or another appropriate
healt hcare professio nal for further evaluat ion.
The Investigator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy  and must
notify Amgen Glo bal Pat ient Safet yimmediately  about the outcom e of the pregnancy  (either 
norm al orabnormal outcome) .
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the I nvest igator
shoul d report the abnorm al outcom e as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any o f the seri ous
criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Amgen Glo bal Pat ient Safet y using the paper Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge of the event. 
All neonatal  deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to
causalit y, as an SAE. In addit ion, any infant death after 28 day s that the Invest igator suspects is
related to in utero exposure to the IP shoul d also be reported as an SAE to Amgen Glo bal Pat ient

investigator’s/site’s aware ness o f the pregnancy  (Note:  Si tes are not required to provide any 
inform ation on the Pregnancy  Notificat ion Form that vio lates the country  or regi ons l ocal 
privacy  laws). 
The invest igator will attempt to obtain a signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant 
healt h informat ion directly from the pregnant female partner to obtain addit ional pregnancy 
inform ation.   
After obtaining the female partner ’s signed consent for release of pregnancy  and infant healt h 
inform ation the investigator will co llect pregnancy outcome and infant healt h informat ion on the 
pregnant partner and her baby  and com plete the pregnancy  questi onnai res. This information will 
be forwarded to Amgen Glo bal Pat ient Safety .     
Generally , infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 m onths after the birth of the child (if 
applicable). 
Any terminat ion of the pregnancy will be reported to Amgen Global Pat ient Safet y regardl ess of 
fetal status (presence or absence of ano malies) or indicat ion for procedure .
10.4.3. Collection of Lactation Informa tion 
Invest igator will co llect lactation informat ion on any female subject who breastfeeds 
while taking IP through 28 day s post last dose of IP.  
Inform ation will be recorded on the Lactation Notificat ion Form  (refer to Appendix W) 
and submitted by  facsimile or em ail to Am gen Gl obal Patient Safet y within 24 hours of 
the invest igator’s knowledge of event.
Study  treatm ent will be discont inued if female subject breastfeeds during the study.
With the female subjects signed consent for release of mother and infant healt h 
inform ation, the invest igator will collect mother and infant healt h informat ion and 
complete the l actati on questi onnaire on any female subject who breastfeeds while taking 
IP through 28 day s after di scont inuing IP.       
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any seriousness criterion must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the 
Invest igator ’s knowledge of the event . Thi s instructi on pertains to init ial SAE reports as well as 
any fo llow-up reports.
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relat ionship to apremilast ) that occur during 
the study  (from the time the subject signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of 
apremilast ) and any SAE m ade known to the Investigator at any time following the protocol -

All aspects of the study  will be carefully mo nitored by  Amgen or its authori zed representative 
for com pliance wi th applicable government regulatio ns wit h respect to current GCP and SOPs .
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Amgen ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study .All aspects of the study  are reviewed wit h the Invest igator and the staff at a study  
initiation visit and/or at an Invest igators ’Meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study , an
Amgen representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Invest igator. Monitoring will 
include on -site visi ts with the Investi gator and his/her staff as well as any  appropri ate 
communicat ions by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During m onitoring visi ts, the f acilities, IP
storage area, CRFs, subject ’s source documents, and all o ther study  docum entati on will be 
inspected/reviewed by the Amgen representative in accordance wit h the Study  Moni toring Pl an.
Accuracy  will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that i s a di rect com parison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs agai nst the appropri ate source documentation. Any result ing 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Any necessary  
correcti ons will be made direct ly to the CRFs or via queries by the Invest igator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitori ng procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusion 
criteria and docum entati on of  SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Addit ional 
monitoring act ivities may be outlined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an.
15.2. Audits and Inspe ctions
In addit ion to the routine monitoring procedures, a Qualit y, Com pliance & Audit, Learning & 
Perform ance unit exists wi thin Amgen .  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of 
clinical research act ivities in accordance with Amgen SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines and regulat ions.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilit ies where the study  took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study  subject parti cipation for 
audits and inspect ions by IRB/ ECs, regul atory  authori ties (egg,Food and Drug Administration 
[FDA ], European Medicines Agency [ EMA ], Health Canada) and com pany authorized 
representatives. The Invest igator should make every effort to be available for the audi ts and/or 
inspections. If the Investigator is contacted by  any regul atory  authori ty regarding an inspect ion, 
he/she shoul d contact Amgen immediately.
15.3. Product Complaint

or entheseal) w ith ≥ 3 points fro m the following 5 categories:
1.Evidence of current psori asis, a personal history  of psori asis, or a family  history  of 
psori asis.
Current psoriasis is defined as psoriat ic skin or scalp disease present today  as judged 
by a rheumatol ogist or dermatologist.2
A personal history  of psori asis is defined as a history  of psori asis that m ay be 
obtained fro m a pati ent, f amily  physician, dermatologist, rheumatologist, or other 
qualified health care provider.
A family history  of psori asis is defined a s a history of psori asis in a first - or second-
degree relative according to patient report.
2.Typical  psori atic nail dystrophy  including ony cholysis, pitting, and hyperkeratosis 
observed on current physical examinat ion.
3.A negat ive test result for the presenc e of rheumatoid factor by  any method except l atex 
but preferably  by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay or nephelo metry , according to the 
local laboratory  reference range.
4.Either current dactylit is, defined as swelling of an ent ire digit, or a hi story  of dactylitis 
recorded by  a rheumatol ogist.
5.Radiographic evidence of juxta -articular new bone format ion, appearing as ill -defined 
ossification near jo int margins (but excluding osteophy te formation) on plain radiographs 
of the hand or foot.

is measured by physical examinat ion of the fo llowing j oints.Tenderness (yes/no) will 
be assessed at 6 sites of tendon insert ions (0 -6) as depicted below: 
Lateral  epicondyle, l eft and ri ght
Medial femoral condyle, left and right
Achilles tendon insert ion, left and right
Tenderness on physical examinat ion is recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) fo r each of the 
6 sites, for an overall score range of 0 to 6. Higher count represents a greater enthesit is burden.

The LDI (Healy, 2008a ; Helliwell, 2005 )measures the ratio of the circumference of the affec ted 
digit to the ci rcumference of the digit on the opposite hand or foot, using a minimum difference 
of 10% to define a dactylit ic digit. The ratio of circumference is mult iplied by a tenderness score.
Affected fingers are marked on a diagram displaying fingers and toes. Circumferences o f the 
affected and contralateral fingers are then measured around the proximal phalanx, as close as 
possible to the web space, using eit her a m easuring tape or a pre -calibrated l oop. 
The clinician then squeezes the affected fingers with moderate pressure and documents the 
patient’s response: 0 = no tenderness, 1 = tender, 2 = tender and winces, and 3 = tender and 
withdraws.

The rati o of circumference between an affected finger and the contralateral unaffected finger is 
recorded. If both sides are affected, the circumference o f the affected finger is co mpared to 
norm ative data supplied in a table. The tenderness score ( 0-3) for a finger with dactylit is 
is 
recorded, and a total score is generated for each finger. If mult iple fingers are affected, each 
score i s added together to produce a total for the patient.
In addi tion, as part of the LDI, number of affected digits wil l be evaluated. Each digit on the 
hands and feet will be rated as zero for no dactylit is or 1 for dactylit is present. The dactylit is 
score i s the sum o f the individual scores for each digit.

PsAID -12SCORING AND CALCULATION RULES 
The PsAID is calcula tedbased on 12 NRS questions. Each NRS is assessed as a number between 
0 and 10. 
Calculators and translat ions are available at 
http://www.eular.org/index.cfm?framePage=/st_com_clinical_tools.cfm .
1.Calculation  
PsAID final value = 
(PsAID1 (pain) NRS value (range 0 -10) x 3) 
+ (PsAID2 (fat igue) NRS value (range 0- 10) x 2) 
+ (PsAID3 (skin) NRS value (range 0- 10) x 2) 
+ (PsAID4 (Work and/or leisure activit ies) NRS value (range 0- 10) x 2) 
+ (PsAID5 (funct ion) NRS value (range 0- 10) x 2) 
+ (PsAID6 (disco mfort) NRS va lue (range 0- 10) x 2) 
+ (PsAID7 (sleep) NRS value (range 0 -10) x 2) 
+ (PsAID8 (coping) NRS value (range 0- 10) x 1) 
+ (PsAID9 (anxiet y) NRS value (range 0- 10) x 1) 
+ (PsAID10 (embarrassment) NRS value (range 0- 10) x 1) 
+ (PsAID11 (social life) NRS valu e (range 0 -10) x 1) 
+ (PsAID12 (depression) NRS value (range 0- 10) x 1) 
The total is divided by 20 . Thus, the range of the final PsAID value is 0 -10, where 
higher figures indicate worse status. 
2. Missing data imputation 
If one of the 12 NRS values composing the PsAID is missing, the imputation is as fo llows:
a.calculate the m ean value of the 11 other (non -missing) NRS values (range, 0 -10)
b.impute this value for the missing NRS value
c.then, calculate the PsAID score as explained above. 
If 2 or more of the NRS values are missing, the PsAID score is considered a missing value 
(no imputation) .

The ri sks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilast are not known at this time. Result s of 
the animal and in vitro studies can be found in the IB.
All females of childbearing potential3must use one of the approved contraceptive options as 
described in Section 4.3while o n IP and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose 
of the IP. The female subject’s chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time the 
female subject is screened for the study  (for example, horm onal contracepti on shoul d be ini tiated 
at least 28 days before screening).
At screening and at baseline, and at any  time during the study , when an FCBP’s contraceptive 
measures or abilit y to beco me pregnant changes, the invest igator (or a representative as a study  
nurse) will educate the s ubject regarding contraception options and the correct and consistent use 
of effect ive contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.
                                               
3A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy (the 
surgical removal of the uterus )or bilat eral oophorectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been 
postmenopa usal for at least 24 consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 
consecutive months). A tubal ligation alone is not sufficient to qualify a female as of non -childbearing potential.

TITLE  A master protocol to test the impact of discontinuing chronic therapies in 
people  with cystic fibrosis  on highly effective CFTR modulator  therapy  
(SIMPLIFY)  
NUMBER OF 
SITES /SUBJECTS  Approximately 80  sites  
Approximately 920 subjects  
STUDY DESIGN  This master protocol is  designed to evaluate the independent effects of 
discontinuing hypertonic saline ( Study  A) and dornase alfa (Study B) in people  
with cystic fibrosis (CF)  age 12 and older currently taking the highly effective 
modulator elexacaftor/tezacaftor /ivacaftor (ETI). Study  A and  Study  B are 
identical open label two -arm randomized trials consisting of a 2-week screening 
period , randomizatio n to continue or discontinue  hypertonic saline (Study  A) or 
dornase alfa  (Study  B), followed by a  6-week study per iod. Subjects  taking only  
hypertonic saline  (HS) or dornase alf a at trial entry will be randomized 1:1 to 
either continue or discontinue the applicable therapy  (i.e. HS or dornase  alfa) . 
Subjects  taking both  hypertonic saline and dornase alf a at study  entry will be 
randomized to participate in either Study A or Study B and will be randomized 
(1:1) to continue or discontinue the applicable therapy  (i.e. HS or dornase  alfa) . 
After completion of the first study, eligible subjects  may subsequently enroll i n 
the alternative study.  
Clinical outcomes ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second [ FEV 1], antibiotic use, 
pulmonary exacerbations, and patient reported outcomes), safety (adverse 
events) and the subject’s perception of how stopping HS or dornase alfa (or 
both) would impact their daily life  will be evaluated in all subjects .  Additional 
outcome  measurements will be conducted in a subset of subjects at selected 
study sites:  
• Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) to evaluate changes in lung clearance 
index (LCI)  
• Mucociliary  Clearance (MCC) using inhaled radio -labeled particles to 
evaluate changes in mucoci liary clearance  
STUDY 
POPULATION  This master  protocol will enroll people with CF who are a ge 12 -17 years old  
with FEV 1 ≥ 70% predicted, and people with CF who are 18 years and older with  
FEV 1 ≥ 60% predicted . Subjects must be clinically stable and currently taking ETI 
in addition to hypertonic saline and/or dornase alfa for at least  the 90 days 
prior to screening. Study  A and Study  B will enroll approximately 400 subjects 
each ( 800 total) . 
After interim safety reviews by the CFF Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) , an 
additional cohort of 120  subjects ≥ 18 years old with FEV 1 between 40 and <60% 
predicted may be enrolled into Study A (hypertonic saline).   
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  Study  A: 
• To determin e whether discontinuing hypertonic saline is non -inferior to 
continuing hypertonic saline among people with CF  on ETI, as measured by 
the 6 -week absolute change in FEV
1 % predicted

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  Study  B: 
• To determine whether discontinuing dornase alfa is non -inferior to 
continuing dornase alfa among subject s on ETI, as measured by the 6 -week 
absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted  
PRIMARY 
ENDPOINT  The absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from Visit 1 (randomiz ation)  to Visit 3 
(week 6)  
SAMPLE SIZE  It is anticipated from prior CF trials conducted through the TDNCC that the 
attrition and non -adherence rate will be less than 20% , and thus it is reasonable 
to expect that a total sample size of 400 per study will enable at least 308 subjects to complete the trial and be included in the per -protocol analysis (PPA) 
population.  The PPA population will be the primary analysis populatio n for test 
of non -inferiority.  
Assuming a standard deviation for the change in FEV 1% predicted of 8.4, a total 
sample size of 308 provides 88% power to detect non -inferiority with a margin 
of -3% absolute FEV 1 % predicted when there is truly no effect of 
discontinuation.  
If the DMC approves enrollment of a lower lung function cohort, approximately 
60 per arm in Study A will be recruited for exploratory analyses focused on the 
safety of discontinuation of hypert onic saline in this cohort.

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  1 BACKGROUND  
Health outcomes in p eople with CF  have steadily improved for decades through high quality, multi -
disciplinary clinical care models and expanding therapeutic options. These advances have most often 
been additive a nd require people with CF  and their families to dedicate significant time and resources 
toward daily care needs. Since 2012, a small but increasing number of people with CF  have  benefit ed 
from highly effective CFTR modulator treatment (HEMT). This “highly effective” description refers to health benefits which are as good as  those typically observed in people with a G551D mutation when 
treated with ivacaftor: sweat chloride reduction by approximately 50 mmol/L, FEV
1 % increase by ≥ 10%, 
large reduction in re spiratory symptoms, and ≥ 50% reduction in risk of acute pulmonary 
exacerbation (1, 2) . Until recently , < 10% of the US CF population has been eligible for HEMT by age and 
mutation -based label indication. Through continued progress in CFTR modulator drug de velopment and 
use in younger populations, t his number is dramatically increas ing and is expected  to reach  ≥ 90%.  
As transformative modulator drug therap ies emerge, many in the CF Community (patients, families and 
caregivers) are asking if any of the pre -existing therapies can be reduced or eliminated.  A survey of 
several hundred people with CF , their family members, and CF care providers was conducted in the US 
in 2018. Survey results from both the CF Community and Clinician -Investigator groups indicate very high 
support for this research and widespread interest in participating (3) . Over 80% of people with CF  or 
their parents surveyed reported that trials testing discontinuation  of chronic therapies should be 
conducted in groups benefitting from HEMT.  In parallel, 94% of CF clinicians supported such trials  and 
both groups expressed high interest in participating in trials testing withdrawal of either hypertonic saline or dornase alfa.  Both of these  nebulized,  inhaled therapies were also identified by t he CF 
Community as relatively burdensome components of daily care.   
2 STUDY RATIONALE  
The initial population of people with CF in the US gain ing new access to HEMT in the form of 
elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) are age 12 years old and older with at least one  F508del mutation . 
Results from Phase 3 clinical trials  (4, 5)  testing ETI indicate that this drug combination provides clinical 
improvements as good as, if not  better , than th ose observed with ivacaftor monotherapy in people with 
the G551D mutati on (2).  The SIMPLIFY master protocol will study people treated with ETI  who also use 
inhaled hypertonic saline and/or inhaled dornase  alfa by clinical prescription. In this adolescent and 
adult study population, w e will be testing the question of treatment discontinuation rather than the 
question of whether or not to start a therapy in the first place.  
The two lead  therapies to be stud ied in the SIMPLIFY master protocol  are hypertonic saline and dornase 
alfa. Both are  identified as relatively burdensome, are intended  to improve mucociliary clearance and 
have  demonstrated dynamic effects on measures of pulmonary func tion (5-8). Early studies with either 
hypertonic saline or dornase alfa demonstrated a return to baseline  lung function (i.e. , pre-treatment 
FEV 1 % predicted ) within 14 days of stopping the treatmen t (6). HEMT  (i.e., ivacaftor)  also improves lung 
function  and mucociliary clearance , with demonstrably greater effects than either hypertonic saline or 
dornase alfa  (1, 2, 7) . Data indicate that ETI may be even more effective than ivacaftor monotherapy at 
improving CFTR function and airway clearance, and ETI will be indicated for a much larger proportion of 
people with CF . It is not known if hypertonic saline or dornase alfa improve or maintain pulmonary 
health above what is already gained through ETI use . 
FEV 1 % predicted has been the most frequently used outcome measure of lung function  in CF clinical 
trials , including studies of hypertonic saline, dornase alfa, and HEMT  (2, 6, 8, 9). However, an alternative 
Protocol  SIMPLIFY -IP-19 Confidential  
Version #:  1 Version Date: February 1 4, 2020  Page 8 of 35 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  and perhaps  more sensitive measure of change in lung  function using multiple breath washout (MBW) 
and the lung clearance index (LCI) has also been used to test  pulmonary benefits from muco -active 
drugs or modulators (7, 10, 11) . LCI improvement  from ivacaftor in those with G551D  was nearly twice 
the effect measured with either inhale d hypertonic saline or dornase alfa, though study population 
demographics differed  (7, 10, 11). LCI is more useful in those with better preserved lung function and it 
is unclear how it will perform in the group recruited to SIMPL IFY. LCI is also not available at all study 
sites. However, the potential to capture even small changes in pulmonary function through LCI, possibly 
in those with higher baseline lung function, is valuable and LCI will be conducted at SIMPLIFY sites with 
this capability as a secondary outcome measure.  
Including spirometry and LCI may increase the ability of this master protocol to detect and understand the impact of treatment withdrawal on airway function. Additionally, mucociliary clearance (MCC) scans will be done at a small number of SIMPLIFY  study  sites with this capability and may provide important 
physiological data related to spirometry and MBW  (12). Consistency across all three of these related 
outcome measures would increase confidence in the interpr etation of the trial results.  If this master 
protocol determin es that people on ETI who discontinue  these therapies have no appreciable loss in 
lung function  or change in MCC, our  hypothesis will be supported that certain daily therapies might not 
be neces sary or beneficial in at least some people treated with ETI.  If this master protocol demonstrates 
that people treated with ETI who continue hypertonic saline or dornase alfa have measurably better outcomes , then these data will  help  to justify the time , effort and cost of continuing such treatments .  
Transformative improvement in CF clinical care through HEMT  represents an important opportunity to 
test the impact of withdrawing chronic  therapies, specifically  hypertonic saline and do rnase alfa, in a 
randomized, controlled setting. Observational studies of treatment withdrawal are prone to  
confoun ding by indication and, if insufficiently powered, may be difficult to interpret .  SIMPLIFY will  limit 
indication bias through randomization and is powered to test hypotheses of non -inferiority in order to 
determine whether discontinuation of each therapy is comparable to continuing therapy as measured by change in pulmonary function. As there are currently no data from controlled trials testin g the effects 
of discontinuing these therapies in CF, the results of this protocol will be important when considering individual treatment decisions  among th e increasingly large percentage of p eople with CF  on highly 
effective modulator therapies.      
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
Drug Intervention: Each  study in this master protocol is unblinded and there is no study drug or new 
exposure to a drug compound. Subjects  enrolled in a study will be randomized to either continue or 
discontinue a medication that has already been clinically prescribed and used  prior to enrollment . It is 
possible that discontinuing a medication (i.e. , hypertonic saline or dornase alfa) will result in a decline in  
health. Determining whether or not this occurs among people  on chronic ETI is the purpose of the 
protocol  and subjects  will be monitored closely. The length of each  study  has been minimized to an 
interval that is thought to be sufficient  to determine if a change in lung function occurs. After the 6 -
week randomized participation period  to either Study A (hypertonic saline) or Study B (dornase alfa) , 
subjects  and their care providers will decide whether or not to continue use of these medications. 
Subjects  who experience an adverse event (AE) during Study A or Study B  should be treated by clinical 
indication, including the  potential to restart any medication that was stopped for this study.  
Spirometry Test: Potential shortness of breath or light headedness.  
MBW Test : The instrument to be used for the MBW test is the Exhalyzer ® D by Eco Medics AG 
(Duernten, Switzerland). There is a very small risk of hyperventilation, which is minimized because each

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  breath will be visualized on the computer screen in real time and the exhaled gases are monitored. 
Rarely with hyperventilation , there may be dizziness or fainting.  
MCC Test:  The following complications could result from inhalation of nebulized  aerosols: cough, 
shortness of breath, hoarseness, throat irritation,  temporary decrease in  lung function measurements, 
wheezing and decrease in oxygen saturation. The MCC  procedure entails exposure to some radiation. 
The amount of radiation dose received during  a given  study (2 MCC scans) is approximately 0.9 mSV. 
The risk  from the radiation dose received from this procedure is too small to be detected but is 
significantly less than the  radiation dose received from the natural environment over the course of 1 
year (3 mSv) . Since radiation risk is a cumulative risk concern, a n eligibility  criterion  has been added to 
exclude patients whose recent radiation  exposure is greater than  typical. Typically , significant additional 
radiation exposure in CF patients (above environmental exposure) would come from chest computed 
tomograph y (CT) procedures. Patients who have had more than 2  chest  CTs in the past year or a 
combination of procedures that are believed to have exposed the  subject’s lungs to >150 mSv for adults 
≥ 18 years old, >15 mSv for children ˂  18 years  would be excluded. In addition, a potential risk of 
radiation exposure to an unborn fetus  exists among pregnant females. All those able to become 
pregnant  will be required to  undergo a pregnancy test.  
3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Study Overview  
This is a master protocol with two c oncurrent randomized trials. It is designed to evaluate the 
independent effects of discontinuing hypertonic saline ( Study A) and dornase alfa ( Study  B) in people 
with CF age 12 and older taking ETI for at least 90 days prior to study screening. Individuals  with CF ages 
12-17 years with FEV 1 70% predicted or greater and those 18  years  and older with FEV 1 60% predicted or 
greater may enroll.  There is no upper limit for FEV 1% predicted. Study  A and Study  B are identical 
randomized, open label two -arm randomize d trials consisting of a 2 -week screening period, 
randomization to continue or discontinue hypertonic saline ( Study  A) or dornase alfa ( Study  B), followed 
by a 6 -week study period. Only those that remain clinically stable and maintain adequate reported 
adherence to inhaled drug therapy between screening and Visit 1 will be eligible for randomization.   
Subjects currently being treated with only hypertonic saline or dornase alfa will be enrolled in Study  A or 
Study  B (as applicable ) and will be randomized 1:1 to either continue or discontinue their current 
prescribed therapy .  
Subjects who are currently being treated with both hypertonic saline and dornase alfa will remain on 
both therapies during the screening period and then be randomized to Study  A (hype rtonic saline) or 
Study  B (dornase alfa) as well as  randomized (1:1) to continue or discontinue the applicable therapy.  
The randomization to Study A or Study B among subjects on both therapies is not optional and is 
essential to reduce indication bias and  ensure comparable populations across studies. After completion 
of the first study , these subjects may subsequently enroll in the alternate study  if they meet eligibility 
criteria.  
For subjects randomly assigned to continue their therapy during a given  study, this therapy should be 
taken at least once daily according to each subject’s pre- existing, clinically prescribed regimen  (e.g. , 
daily, twice daily) . The concentration of hypertonic saline will also be according to clinical prescription 
(e.g. , 7% sodiu m chloride or 3.5% sodium chloride).   Hypertonic saline concentration must be at least 
3%.

safety ( AEs), and subject  perception of how stopping HS or dornase alfa (or both) would impact their 
daily life  will be evaluated at all sites during each  study. Additional measurements will be conducted at 
selected study sites with the capabilities to conduct these procedures:  
 MBW  to evaluate changes in LCI  
 MCC scans using inhaled radio -labeled particles and imaging techniques to evaluate changes in 
mucociliary clearance  
Each study includes four  study visits over a period of 8 weeks , including the 2 -week screening period .  
 Subjects taking only hypertonic sali ne or only dornase alfa upon study  entry at the Screening 
Visit would participate in study visits for up to 8 weeks.  
 For s ubjects taking both hypertonic saline and dornase alfa upon study  entry at the Screening 
Visit : 
o They have the potential  to participate in either one or both studies . Subjects would 
participate in the first study for up to 8 weeks. After completion of the last visit in the first 
study, subjects may consider enrollment into the second study. If subjects are eligible and 
enroll in the second study, they would participate in study visits for up to an additional 8 
weeks.   
o Participation in the two studies may be consecutive  or separated by any length of time.   
 All subjects will additionally be asked to complete electronic questionn aires approximately every 
28 days for up to 24 weeks after their final study visit (Visit 3 , Week 6 ). For subjects who 
participate  in a second study  within 24 weeks of completing the first , the post study 
questionnaires  from the first study may be stopped.   
A data monitoring committee (DMC) will be reviewing safety data on an ongoing basis for both studies .  
Upon interim review of safety data, an optional cohort with lower baseline lung function may be 
enrolled into Study A  (hypertonic saline) . The optional  cohort will include people with CF ≥ 18 years old 
with FEV 1 between 40 and less than 60  % predicted who satisfy the remaining criteria for participation in 
Study A. Additional endpoints, including LCI and MCC, will not be obtained in this cohort.

6 SUBJECT SELECTION  
6.1 Study Population  
People with a diagnosis of CF who meet all eligibility  criteria will be eligible for participation in this  
protocol .   
Study A will enroll approximately 400 subjects  (approximately 200 randomized to discontinue 
hypertonic saline and 200  to continue hypertonic saline).  
Study B will enroll approximately 400 subjects  (approximately 200 randomized to discontinue dornase 
alfa and 200  to continue dornase alfa).   
Lower Lung Function Cohort: Approximately 120 additional subjects will be enrolled into this cohort in 
Study A upon approval from the DMC .  
It is estimated that approximately 920 u nique people with CF  will be randomized in this master protocol, 
and that a subset of people with CF  on both hypertonic saline and dornase alfa will enroll in both Study 
A and Study B.    
Additional assessments conducted in only a subset of subjects:  
 MBW A ssessment: We anticipate that up to 400  subjects will provide data for the MBW 
assessment.  
 MCC Sub -Study : Approximately 30 subjects from Study A and 30 subjects from Study B will  
enroll in the MCC sub -study .

children ˂ 18 years old) .  
 
6.5 Study Specific Tolerance for Eligibility  Criteria  
Subjects who fail to meet one or more of the eligibility  criteria will not be enrolled in to a study . Waivers 
of any of the above study entry criteria will not be granted.  
6.6 Screen Fail Criteria  
Any consented subject  who is excluded from  the study before randomization i s considered a screen 
failure. All screen failures must be documented with the reason for the screen failure adequately stated.  
If a subject screen fails prior to randomization, they can be rescreened up to two times i f the site staff 
feels they meet eligi bility criteria.  Rescreened subjects will have to complete all screening procedures 
(i.e., data from previous screenings cannot be used).    
7 CONCURRENT MEDICATIO NS 
All subjects should be maintained on the same medications (and airway clearance routines) th roughout 
the entire study  period  (i.e., Screening Visit through Visit 3) , as medically feasible, with no introduction 
of new chronic therapies  or discontinuation of current chronic therapies except those outlined in the 
protocol .  Subjects that take m edica tions that are cycled (e.g. , inhaled antibiotics) should continue to do 
so by clinical prescription .  Medications may be changed between Study  A and  Study  B for those 
participating in both trials  (although subject s must meet all eligibility criteria at the  screening visit for 
the second study  including recent stability of their chronic medications ). 
7.1 Required  Medications and Treatments  
For each  study :  
 Subjects must continue ETI from Screening to Visit 3  (week 6 ). 
 Subjects must continue hypertonic saline and/ or dornase alfa (as applicable to Study  A or Study  
B) from Screening to Visit 1  (randomization ). 
7.2 Prohibited Medications and Treatments  
Subjects should not change or begin  new  chronic respiratory therapies, excep t as defined in this 
protocol, from the Screening Visit to Visit 3.  Subjects should not begin investigational treatments from the Screening Visit to Visit 3 . 
MCC Sub -study: Subject must withhold  hypertonic saline and /or dornase alfa within  12 hours prior to 
each MCC scan as noted in the Schedule of Events.  Subjects randomized to continue with these 
therapies in either Study A or Study B should resume treatment upon completion of the MCC  scan  and 
are encouraged to do so the day of V isit 1 or 3 , following the study visit .

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  8 STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Studies and Treatment Groups  
At the randomization visit (Visit 1), those subjects who are eligible and taking only either hypertonic  
saline or dornase al fa will be enrolled in th e appropriate study  (A or B). If both studies remain open to 
enrollment, those taking both and enrolling for the first time will be randomized to study  (A or B). If 
only one study is open for enrollment, eligible subjects taking both therapies may  be enrol led into only 
the open study. Those taking both and who are eligible and enrolling for the second time may enroll in 
the study  that they were not previously in if that study remains open for enrollment .  
  
At V isit 1 , subjects  will be randomized 1:1  to continue or discontinue  the applicable  therapy. 
Randomization will occur by a predetermined scheme using block randomization with the goal of 
ensuring balance  between  treatment  arms as detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (S AP). Within each 
study , randomization  will be stratified by Visit 1 FEV 1 % predicted (≥90%, <90% ), treatment 
combination at screening (single or concurrent use of hypertonic saline and/or dornase alfa), prior 
stud y participation (yes/no), and age ( ≥18 vs < 18).  Subjects enrolled in the lower lung function cohort 
will be similarly randomized to conti nue or discontinue hypertonic salin e and stratified by current 
dornase alfa use .  Any deviations from the randomization schema will be documented in the SAP .  
Randomization will occur centrally using a web -based  randomization system linked to the electroni c 
data capture  (EDC) system.  Only authorized site personnel are given access to the randomization 
module  in EDC . Authorized site personnel will enter subject  eligibility information and whether or not 
the subject  signed informed consent. If the information entered into the EDC system is consistent with 
eligibility criteria for the study , the system will  provide the appropriate authorized site personnel with a 
randomization assignment  for that subject that matches a specific treatment  arm.  
8.2 Blinding  
Each study in the protocol is open label ; no blinding to treatment assignment for individual subjects  or 
their care -providers will be performed. However, aggregate study results will be blinded and tightly 
controlled unt il the end of each study . 
9 STUDY PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES  
The procedures described below will be performed at the visits  as noted in the Schedule of Events 
(Appendix 2). 
9.1 Clinical Assessments  within each Study  
9.1.1 Informed Consent  
Prior to conducting any study -related activities, written informed consent and the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be signed and dated by the subject or

and positive cultures for key CF patho gens will be recorded . 
9.1.7 Physical Examination  
An abbreviated physical examination will be performed by a licensed professional (MD, NP, RN, PA) as 
noted in the Schedule of Events.  The abbreviated exam includes respiratory, cardiovascular, and 
abdominal asses sments.    
After Visit 1 , new clinically significant abnormal physical exam findings must be documented as AEs.  
9.1.8 Weight and Height   
Weight will be measured on the same scale and recorded as noted in the Schedule of Events. Adults and 
children may remain in  clothes (without shoes). A standing height will be measured and recorded as 
noted in the Schedule of Events . 
9.1.9 Spirometry  
Spirometry will be performed as noted in the Schedule of Events and in accordance with the current 
American Thoracic Society recommendations for the performance and interpretation of tests.  
Two  puffs of  albuterol  or levalbuterol (Xopenex)  will be administered 15 minutes to 2 hours prior to 
spirometry  during all study visits . Subjects that have already self-administered albuterol or levalbuterol 
(Xopenex) within 2 hours prior to  spirometry  do not need to re- administer;  however those that have 
taken a long -acting bronchodilator (e.g. , salmeterol, fo rmoterol as contained in Advair®, Symbicort®, or 
Protocol  SIMPLIFY -IP-19 Confidential  
Version #:  1 Version Date: February 1 4, 2020  Page 19 of 35 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  similar medications) would be required to administer albuterol or levalbuterol (Xopenex)  15 minutes to 
2 hours prior to spirometry  at the visit .   
Detailed instructions  on the order of procedures  will be provided in supplemental study materials . 
9.1.10  Subject Questionnaire s (paper) :  
 CRISS and CFQR : Subjects will complete paper  questionnaires  (CRISS and CFQR)  to assess  CF-
specific symptom s at the beginning of each visit as noted in the Schedule of Events . These 
questionnaires  include  less than 20  questions in total and take less than five  minutes to 
complete.  
 Barriers to Adherence Survey : Subjects will complete a  paper CF-specific survey  to ascertain 
barriers  to adherence to their prescribed clinical therapies  as noted in the Schedule of Events .  
 Impact of Changing Daily Therapies  Question naire : All subjects will be asked to complete a 
paper questionnaire about their perception of how stopping either hypertonic saline  or dornase 
alfa (or both) would impact their daily lives at Visit 3 ( week 6 ).     
9.1.11  Subject Questionnaire s (electronic) :  
 Daily Study Adherence Questionnaire : Subjects will be requested to complete a daily electronic 
questionnaire to  document  their use of ETI, hypertonic saline , dornase alfa, and  mechanical  
airway clearance therapy . The electronic application will be downloaded  to a subject ’s phone or 
tablet  at the Screening Visit  and completed as noted in the Schedule of Events.  Information 
about whether or not a subject has met the eligibility criteria related to percent of completed 
questionnaires and percent adhere nce to current treatments will be provided to the study team 
prior to randomization at Visit 1 to confirm the subject meets the eligibility criteria. After Visit 1, 
the study team will  be able to see if the subject has completed the daily questionnaires, b ut will 
not be able to see responses.  
 Monthly Post  Study Participation Questionnaire: All subjects will be asked to complete 
electronic questionnaires regarding use of ETI, hypertonic saline, dornase alfa,  mechanical 
airway clearance therapy, and antibiot ics approximately every 28 days for up to 24 weeks after 
their final visit (Visit 3, week 6 ) in each study.  These questionnaires may not be administered 
during the time period of participation in a second study (Screening to Week 6 ) among those 
subjects p articipating in both Study A and Study B. The study team will be able to see if the 
subject has completed the monthly  questionnaires, but will not be able to see responses.  
9.1.12  Research Coordinator Review of Electronic Questionnaires  
The Site Research Coordinator will review the completion status of the Daily Study Adherence 
Questionnaire a s noted in the Schedule of Events  to confirm that the subject has completed the 
questionnaire(s).  If a subject has not completed the questionnaires, Research Coordin ators will remind 
the subject to complete future questionnaires.    
9.1.13  Signs and Symptoms  Evaluation   
Between the Screening Visit and Visit 3 ( week 6 ), whenever  a subject initiates a new IV, oral or inhaled 
antibiotic, the presence of specific signs and sympto ms will be extracted from the medical record and 
documented  in addition to physician’s assessment of whether the event is a pulmonary exacerbation .

Version #:  1 Version Date: February 1 4, 2020  Page 20 of 35 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  9.1.14  MBW/Multiple Breath Washout Measurement 
The Exhalyzer D (Eco Medics, AG) will be used to assess the effi ciency of ventilation  distribution and gas 
mixing by measuring the rate of clearance of an inert gas from the lungs  in compliance with  the Multiple 
Breath Wash out SOP.  During the test, subjects will be in an upright  seated position and will use a 
mouthpiec e and  nose clip . Subjects will be asked to breathe normally and a tight seal must be  
maintained on the mouthpiece throughout the test. Each test takes about five  to 10  minutes.  Subjects 
will do between three and five tests with a 5 -minute rest between them. Subjects  will be instructed not 
to drink carbonated beverages for 30 minutes before and between tests  as the CO2 may cause 
inaccurate results.  MBW consists of following a tracer gas over two phases, a wash -in and a washout 
phase. In  the wash -in phase, subjects will breathe room air through the mouthpiece connected to  the 
Exhalyzer D. Subjects will be asked to take breaths until O2 concentration on expiration  drops to below 
17%. After three consecutive breaths in the acceptable CO2 target range  are reached, the subjects will 
start breathing 100% oxygen that comes from a hospital oxygen  tank. In the washout phase, subjects 
will be asked to breathe room air until the N2  concentration is 1/40th of the start concentration for 
three consecutive breaths.  
9.1.15  MCC/Cough Clearance (CC) Measurement  
Site staff will confirm that the subject meets other eligibility for the procedure (i.e., is not  pregnant, 
symptomatic and has withheld the required medications  [See Protocol Section 6. 4]) before proceeding 
with the  MCC procedure. A transmission scan (solid sheet  containing Co57, placed in front of the body) 
of the subject’s lungs will be obtained.  Detailed instruction will be included in a Study Specific 
Procedure. For each measure of  MCC/CC, the subject will inhale  an aerosol of sulfur colloid labeled with 
Tc99m [40  microcuries (μCi) ]. Inhalation will occur until ~40 μCi of radioactivity is deposited in the  lungs 
of subjects and takes approximately two minutes. An initial deposition scan will then  be recorded and, 
as the subject remains seated in front of the gamma camera, continuous  two-minute images will be 
recorded for 34 minutes, and then every 10 minutes for  an additional  60 minutes to monitor particle  
clearance from the lung.  During the first 64 minutes  of imag ing, subjects will be encouraged to suppress 
spontaneous  coughing so that cilia- driven clearance can be assessed. From 6 4–94 minutes, they will  
voluntarily cough through a peak flow meter, to achieve a total of 60 coughs during this  interval, to 
assess CC. Voluntary coughs will be dispersed evenly during this interval. The  peak airflow rate of every 
fifth voluntary cough will be recorded and averaged. Spontaneous  cough frequency will be recorded 
throughout the imaging period.  Subjects will return to the lab for a 15 -minute continuous scan of 
residual lung activity at 6  hours (± 15 minutes) after the initial deposition scan. The images collected will 
be downloaded  in dicom format and sent to University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  
9.1.16  Adverse Events  
Information regarding occurrence of AEs will be captured from randomization  through  Visit 3 . Duration 
(start and end dates), grade , seriousness, outcome, treatment, and relation to study arm treatment will 
be recorded on the case report form ( CRF).  
In addition, any overnight admissions to the hospital that occur between randomization  and Visit 3 will 
be captured on the CRF.

9.2.1 Pregnancy Test  (MCC Sub -Study Only)  
For those participating in the MCC Sub -study, u rine or blood (approximately 2 cc) will be collected from 
those able to become pregnant  for a pregnancy test as noted in the Schedule of Events and tested in 
clinic accordin g to site standard procedures.  
10 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE R EPORTING AND DOCUMEN TATION  
10.1 Adverse Events   
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence during study participation  that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the  study participation .  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with participation 
in th e study  whether or not related to that participation .  An unexpected AE is one of a type not 
identified in nature, severity, or frequency than expected . 
The Investigator will discuss the subject’s health status to identify the occurrence of AEs during each 
subjec t visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  AEs will be recorded in the 
subject CRF.   
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5 .0, as 
modified for CF , should be use d to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities 
judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found on the Study Website.  If the 
experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used 
to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a 
severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Mild; asymptom atic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
Moderate (2)   Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate Instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., 
preparing meals, using the telephone, managing money)  
Severe (3)   Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, dressing, feeding self, using toilet, taking medications)  
Life-threatening (4)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Death (5)  Death related to AE

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  AE Relationship to Treatment Arm Assignment  
The relationship of an AE to the subject’s treatment arm assignment  should be assessed using the 
following guidelines in Table 2.  
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Treatment Arm Assignment  
Relationship 
to Treatment 
Arm 
Assignment   Comment  
Definitely  An event that occurs follows a reasonable temporal sequence after randomization 
to a treatment arm  that is not explained by any other reasonable hypothesis.  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence after randomization to a 
treatment arm ; and that is not explained by any other reasonable hypothesis; and 
that is unlikely to be explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical 
state or by other interventions.   
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence  after randomization to a 
treatment arm ; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other 
factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certaint y to have no relationship to the 
treatment arm assignment.  
  
10.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined  as any AE occurring  in either treatment arm assignment that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 death  
 a life -threatening adverse experience  
 inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate me dical 
judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
10.2.1  Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur on an SAE Report Form.  The collection period for all SAEs will b egin after informed consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit  (Visit 3)  
have been completed.  
All SAE Report Forms will be reviewed by the site investigator and sent to the TDNCC within one business day of the site learning of t he event.  Sites will send the SAE report by either :

11 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJE CTS 
11.1 Early Withdrawal of Subjects from a Study  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudi ce.   
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for early subject withdrawals.  
The reason for the subject’s early withdrawal from the study will be specified in the subject’s source 
documents.  Subjects who withdraw early from the study  (prior to Visit 3)  should be encouraged to 
come in for a final early study withdrawal visit (and the procedures to be followed would include those 
at Visit 3 ).   
Subjects who for any reason modify their hypertonic saline or dornase alfa treatm ent such that it 
deviates from their assigned treatment regimen within a study will not be withdrawn from the study and are encouraged to complete all scheduled study visits.    
11.2 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be  replaced.   
12 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS  
A protocol violation occurs when the subject, investigator, or the Sponsor fails to adhere to significant protocol requirements affecting the eligibility , subject safety and primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol 
violations for this study include, but are no t limited to, the following:  
 Failure to meet eligibility  criteria  
 Subject did not follow  their randomization assignment  
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol violation. The Sponsor will determine if a protocol violation should result in early permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment for a subject.

13 DATA SAFETY MONITORI NG 
The CFF Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will establish a DMC to review data relating to safety, to 
conduct and review interim analyses, and to ensure the continued scientific validity and merit of the study, accor ding to the CFF DSMB Operations Manual and a DMC Charter created for this protocol. 
Further details regarding the interim reviews will be fully specified in the DMC charter and approved by 
the study appointed DMC.  
14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 General Considerations  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed SAP will be written, describing all analyses that 
will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis plan described below.  
For the purposes of analyses, baseline will be defined as Visit 1  (Day 0).  All estimates of differences 
between treatment arms will be reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, and unless otherwise noted, statistical tests when performed will be two -sided and determined at  the 0.05 level. 
Missing data methods for the primary and key secondary endpoints will be described in the SAP. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made  beyond group sequential methods for interim 
monitoring.    
Each study will be analyzed indepe ndently as specified below, with select exploratory analyses 
performed with data pooled across studies.    
14.1.1  Data Sets Analyzed  
The intent to treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects randomized at Visit 1  (Day 0) , will be used for 
all subject disposit ion, secondary, exploratory, and safety summaries .  
The per -protocol analysis (PPA) population , defined as all subjects who meet  criteria as specified in the 
SAP, will be used for the primary analyses in both Study  A and Study  B, with sensitivity analyses 
repeated on the ITT population.   Select se condary analyses will also be run on the PPA population.  
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Treatment arms within  Study  A and Study B will be d escriptively summarized  with respect to baseline 
demographic and clinical characteristics including sex  at birth , CFTR genotype, race, height, weight, and 
all randomization strata.   
14.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary hy pothesis for both Study  A and Study  B is that discontinuing therapy is non -inferior to 
continuing therapy, as measured by the 6 -week change in FEV 1 % predicted.  The primary endpoint for 
each study is the difference between arms in  the change in FEV 1 % predicted from randomization to 
Protocol  SIMPLIFY -IP-19 Confidential  
Version #:  1 Version Date: February 1 4, 2020  Page 25 of 35 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  week 6 . The primary analysis for non -inferiority will be conducted on the PPA population.  A linear 
model will be used to adjust for randomization strata as specified in Section 8.1 . The estimated effects 
of discontinuation  and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported for both studies  A and 
B, and p -values will be evaluated for a one -sided alpha -level 0.025 test of non -inferiority with a margin 
of -3% absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted for each study .  
The lower lung function cohort, if enrolled, will not be included in the primary analysis, but will be 
analyzed as a separate cohort for which the primary and  secondary  analysis within this cohort will focus 
on the evaluation of safety. Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
14.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Differences bet ween treatment arms will be estimated within each study  for i) subjects  initiating ac ute 
antibiotics, ii) subjects  hospitalized, iii) subjects  with a pulmonary exacerbation, and iv) subjects  who 
meet adherence criteria . These differences will be estimated using logistic  regression methods and 
reported with confidence intervals  accounting for randomization strata.  
Differences in the between treatment arms from randomization to week 6  will be estimated in each trial 
for i) CRISS, ii) CFQR, and i ii) LCI using general linear regression adjusting for randomization strata.  
Change in FEV 1 % predicted from Screening to randomization  will also be compared between treatment 
arms within each study using linear regression adj usting for randomization strata.  Descriptive 
summaries of the change from Screening to randomization , and randomization  to week 2  will also be 
provided for all continuous endpoints.   
14.4 Analysis of Safety Endpoints  
All reported SAEs and AEs will be coded using MedDRA and grouped by body system. SAEs and AEs will be tabulated by treatment  arm using standard coding terms sor ted by body system. The incidence of 
AEs in each treatment arm will be tabulated by seriousness, severity, and relationship to treatment arm 
assignment . If an AE is reported more than once during the study period for  a given subject, the greatest 
severity and the worst- case relationship will be presented in tables.  
The number of SAEs and AEs will be summarized for each treatment arm  as follows: (i) The proportion of 
subjects with at least one (S)AE, (ii) The average number of (S)AEs per subject , and (iii) The rate of (S)AEs 
per subject  week of follow -up. Histograms showing the frequency of the number of (S)AEs in each 
treatment group  will be included. Rates of (S)AEs by System Organ Class (SOC) will be presented by 
treatment group. Poisson regression modeling will be used to derive rate ratios and 95% CIs for each SOC. The rate ratios will be compared using a two -sided 0.05 level test for Poisson count data.  
In addition to AEs , the proportion of subjects  temporarily or permanently  changing their assigned 
therapy will be summarized .   
14.5 Analysis of Exploratory Objectives  
Differences between treatment arms in the change in MCC from randomization to week 6  will be 
estimated using general linear regression adjusting for randomization strata  and reported with 
associated confidence intervals.  The average impact score on subject perception of how  stopping HS or 
dornase  alfa (or both) would impact daily life will be summarized at week 6 by treatment arm.  
Among those enrolled in the lower lung function cohort, descriptive safety  summaries will be provided 
for the differences between treatment arms in the change in FEV 1 % predicted, AE rates, and proportion 
Protocol  SIMPLIFY -IP-19 Confidential  
Version #:  1 Version Date: February 1 4, 2020  Page 26 of 35 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  of subjects  re-initiating therapy in the discontinuation arm.  Treatment arms will be formally compared 
within this cohort as further specified in the SAP to determine if discontinuation of therapy results in 
clinically meaningfully  inferior outcomes as compared to remaining on therapy.    
Among those who are currently taking both hypertonic saline and dornase alfa at study  entry, 
exploratory analysis will be performed pooling data across studies .  Data from the arms rand omized to 
remain on therapy in both Study  A and Study  B will be pooled to form a single comparator arm of 
subjects  on both hypertonic saline and dornase alfa across trials.  This comparator arm will be compared 
separately to the subgroups of subjects  in ea ch study  randomized to discontinue  therapy using the same 
methodology as for the primary objective.    
The proportions of subjects  remaining on and off hypertonic saline and dornase alfa for up to 24 weeks 
after completion of each study  will be descriptive ly summarized.  The odds of staying with the same 
regimen as assigned during the previously completed study  will be modeled using logistic regression for 
each treatment arm with covariates derived from both baseline and clinical outcome data during the  
study.  Data across  studies  may be pooled into the same model and repeated measures methodology 
utilized.  Similar methodology will be used to summarize and model the proportion of subjects  with 
acute antibiotic use after completion of each study .   
14.6 Interim A nalysis  
A pre -defined monitoring plan for safet y and study stopping rules will be formalized in conjunction with 
the DMC and will be in place prior to initiating the study. On each study, a formal interim  evaluation of 
harm associated with discontinuing therapy will be conducted as detailed in the DMC c harter.   
Each study  (A and B) will have separate monitoring evaluation s for safety  and a decision to stop ; one will 
not be conditional on the other.  
14.7 Sample Size  
The primary endpoint for each study  is the difference between arms in  the change in FEV 1 % pre dicted 
from randomization to week 6 . Data from previous studies were used to estimate the standard 
deviation of  change in  FEV 1 % predicted, resulting in an estimate of 8.4 % per group  (4,5).  
It is anticipated from prior CF trials conducted through the TDNC C that the attrition and non -adherence 
rate will be less than 20% and thus it is reasonable to expect that a total sample size of 400  per study 
will enable at least 308 subjects to complete the trial and be included in the PPA  population.  The PPA 
populati on will be the primary analysis population for test of non -inferiority.  
A total sample size of 308 provides 88% power to detect non -inferiority with a margin of - 3% absolute 
FEV 1 % predicted when there is truly no effect of discontinuation . It provides 7 4% power when, in truth, 
discontinuation on average decreases FEV 1 % predicted by 0.5% absolute. These results were based on a 
simplified conservative analysis that did not include covariate adjustment.  
If the DMC approves  enrollment of a lower lung function cohort, approximately 60 per arm in Study A will 
be recruited for exploratory analyses focused on the safety of discontinuation of hypertonic saline .

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  15 DATA COLLECTION, RET ENTION A ND CLINICAL MONITORI NG 
15.1 Data Collection Instruments  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents designed to record 
all observations and other pertinent data for each subject who signs informed consent.  
Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corresponding to a subject’s visit into the protocol -specific electronic CRF  when the information corresponding to that visit is available.  
Subjects will not be identified by name in the study database or  on any study documents to be collected 
by the Sponsor (or designee) but will be identified by a site number and subject number.  
If a correction is required for a CRF, the time and date stamp tracks the person entering or updating CRF data and create an electronic audit trail.    
The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for completeness and accuracy by the Investigator. At the completion of the study, a copy of the CRF data will be provided to the site to be reta ined at the Investigator’s site.  
MBW Assessment :  Subjects who are participating in the MBW portion of the SIMPLIFY study will be 
assigned the same unique identification number as the main study.  Sites will provide MBW measurements to the MBW Core Center at the University of Toronto via a secure file transfer application after each study visit for over- reading and quality control.  Data transfer details from the 
sites to the University of Toronto will be provided in the MBW SOP.  The MBW Core Center will send 
over -read MBW data via a secure file transfe r application to the TDNCC for analysis.   
MCC Sub- Study:  Subjects who are participating in the MCC sub -study  will keep the same unique  
identification number as the main  study. The MCC images  will not be entered into the CRF but will be  
provided directly by participating sites to the MCC sub -study principal investigator for evaluation  and 
analysis via secure mail or electronic transfer. The data files will be kept on a password  protected 
computer and routinely backed up. At the end of the study, the sub -study principal investigator will 
provide relevant sub -study data to the TDNCC to be  incorporated into the overall study database .  The 
data will be transferred via a secure file transfer application.  
Data  transfer  from TDNCC to MCC sub -study Lead Investiga tor and STRC Investigators :  At varying 
intervals during the study, the TDNCC will provide  both  the MCC sub -study  lead investigator and the 
STRC ancillary study investigators (See section 9.1.1) with relevant SIMPLIFY CRF data for subjects who 
provide cons ent for the additional research to enable  the sub-study /ancillary study  specific analyses. 
The data will be transferred via a secure file transfer application. Details of the data transfer (including, but not limited to, frequency of  transfer, format of da ta and query process) will be documented in a 
Data Transfer  Agreement between the sub -study /ancillary study  investigator institutions  and the 
TDNCC.   Before data are released to these investigators, documentation of IRB approval of their 
investigation must  be provided to the TDNCC.  
15.2 Data Management Procedures  
TDNCC utilizes Medidata Solutions, Inc. (Medidata) Rave ® for their EDC studies. The Medidata Rave EDC 
system is designed to be US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 Part 11 compliant , with a robust audit 
trail system and electronic signature capabilities.  Study personnel at each site will enter data from a 
Protocol  SIMPLIFY -IP-19 Confidential

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 24 SEP 2019  subject’s visit onto electronic CRF screens via a web browser.  Study subjects will not be identified by 
name in the study database or on any data capture screens but  will be identified by a unique subject 
identification number.  Only study personnel at the  individual sites will be able to link the study ID to the 
subject’s name.  TDNCC also utilizes the Medidata Rave eCOA/ePRO system, a regulatory compliant 
system which allows subject s in a study using Medidata Rave EDC to complete and submit forms and 
data  for patient -reported outcomes electronically on a mobile device to the Medidata Rave EDC System. 
Study personnel at each site will register subjects  using their unique subject identification number which 
generates an activation code unique to that subject . Study site personnel provide the subjects  with their 
activation code. The subject  downloads the Medidata Rave eCOA/ePRO app to their mobile device and 
uses their unique activation code to create their ePRO login and password.   
The Biostatistics and Clin ical Data Management group of the TDNCC will be responsible for data 
processing, in accordance with procedural documentation.  Database lock will occur once quality 
assurance procedures have been completed.  All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing practices for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.   
Data Quality Control and Reporting  
After data have been entered into the study database, data validation checks  will be applied on a regular 
basis. Queries are entered, tracked, and resolved through the EDC system directly .  The study database 
will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries. All changes to the study database will be 
documented in an audit trail.   
15.3 Security and Archival o f Data  
The EDC and Rave eCOA/ePRO systems are hosted by Medidata; the data are stored at Medidata’s 
primary data center in Houston, Texas, with fail- safe data centers in New Jersey.  Data are regularly 
backed up by Medidata.  
Medidata maintains 21 CFR Part 11 -compliant electronic systems, with procedures in place to safeguard 
against unauthorized acquisition of data.  Any authorized communication with the Medidata servers at the Houston Data Center is conducted via SSL (128 -bit) encryption.  Robust password procedures, 
consistent with 21 Part 11, are in place.  Robust physical security procedures are in place at the Houston 
Data Center to prevent unauthorized personnel physical access to the server rooms.  EDC account access 
is maintained and monitored by the  Biostatistics and Clinical Data Management group of the TDNCC.  
Other databases will be stored on Seattle Children’s servers and are safeguarded against unauthorized 
access by established security procedures.  Network accounts are password protected and  maintained 
and monitored by Seattle Children’s .  Data is backed up regularly according to the Information Services  
group’s procedures.  
15.4 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, oth er authorized representatives of 
the Sponsor (or designee), IRB, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon request.  A file for 
each subject must be maintained that includes the signed i nformed consent, HIPAA Authorization and 
assent Form and copie s of all source documentation related to that subject.  The Investigator must 
ensure the reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the CRF was 
derived.

unconditiona l approval of the study protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of 
the Investigator before the study is initiated.  The IRB ’s unconditional approval statement will be 
transmitted by the Investigator to the Sponsor or designee prior  to the shipment of study supplies to the 
site.  This approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title and number and should identify the 
documents reviewed and the date of review.  
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not b e initiated without prior written 
IRB approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects or when the 
change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB  and written verification that the modification was submitted and subsequently 
approved should be obtained.   
The IRB must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for review; serious 
and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring durin g the study in accordance with the standard 
operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new information that may affect adversely the safety of 
the patients of the conduct of the study; an annual update and/or request for re -approval; and when 
the study has been completed.  
16.3 Informed Consent Form  
Informed consent will be obtained for each study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, US 
Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), HIPAA  (if applicable), and local regulations.  
The Investigator will prepare the informed consent form  and HIPAA authorization and provide the 
documents to the Sponsor or designee for approval prior to submission to the IRB .  The consent form 
generated by the Investigator must be acceptable to the Sponsor and be approved by the IRB .  The 
written consent doc ument will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the ICH GCP  
and will also comply with local regulations. The Investigator will send an IRB -approved copy of the 
informed consent form to the Sponsor (or designee) for the study file.  
A prop erly executed, written, informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to entering the 
subject into a study .  Information should be given in both oral and written form and subjects (or their 
legal representatives) must be given ample opportunity  to inquire about details of the study.  If 
appropriate and required by the IRB , assent from the subject will also be obtained.   If a subject is unable 
to sign the informed consent form and the HIPAA authorization, a legal representative may sign for the 
subject.   A copy of t he signed consent form (and assent) will be given to the subject or legal 
representative of the subject and the original will be maintained with the subject’s records.  
During the course of the study, if modifications are made to the co nsent form that impact the subject, 
the subject will be re- consented as described above.  
16.4 Consent for Collection and Use of CFF Registry Number  
To facilitate possible future evaluation of retrospective and prospective information from all patients 
who scre en for this study, the subject’s CFF Registry number will be collected.  The CFF Registry collects 
data on all CF patients who consented to participate in the CFF R egistry and who are followed at CFF -
accredited care centers.  The Registry data includes information from clinical encounters, hospitalizations courses of antibiotics, and year- end surveys.  Data also include microbiology results,

Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 to 30 days before start of prot ocol therapy, as indicated in the study calendar, except 
for pregnancy testing, which must be performed within 48 hours prior to initial ALT-803 administration. Scans and x- rays must be 
performed within 30 days before the start of therapy. In the event that the patient’s condition is changing, laboratory evaluations 
should be repeated within 24 hours before initiating the next cycle of therapy. Please refer to the study calendar below for specific timing of required evaluations.

Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 to 30 days before start of protocol therapy, as indicated in the study calendar, exc ept 
for pregnancy testing, which must be performed within 48 hours prior to initial ALT-803 administration. Scans and x- rays must b e 
performed within 30 days before the start of therapy. In the event that the patient’s condition is changing, laboratory evaluations 
should be repeated within 24 hours before initiating the next cycle of therapy. Please refer to the study calendar below f or specific

Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 to 30 days before start of protocol therapy, as indicated in the study calendar, except for 
pregnancy testing, which must be performed within 48 hours prior to initial ALT-803 administration. Scans and x- rays must be performed within 
30 days before the start of therapy. In the event that the patient’s condition is changing, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 24 hours before initiating the next cycle of therapy. Please refer to the study calenda r below for specific timing of required evaluations.

b ECGs are to be done before ALT -803 infusions on Day 1  and 4, 12 and 24 hours after the first ALT -803 infusion (Cycle 1, Week 1, Day1) . As clinically indicated, ECGs are to 
be obtained to evaluate for cardiac toxicity during  subsequent dose s and cycles of therapy  and follow -up visits .  
c Baseline tumor assessment scans should be done 1 to 30 days before beginning treatment.

ALT -803 infusions on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22  of each treatment cycle.  
h Physical exam must always include neurological assessment. In addition, a funduscopic exam, conducted by the investigator with a hand-held ophthalmoscope, must be done  
prior to starting therapy  (Cycle 1, Day 1, Week 1)  and repeated if clinically indicated  (See Section 6.0  for additional details) .  
iAdditional cycles beyond the 4th cycle may be considered for patients continuing to benefit and tolerating therapy, upon discussion among the sponsor and Principal Investigator.  
jOther labs include: Lactate dehydrogenase, magnesium, phosphate, CK and troponin I or T; must be drawn before and at 12 and 24 hours after the first ALT -803 dose.  
kCBC w/diff, plts  (Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1); must be drawn before and at 12 and 24 hours after the first ALT -803 dose.

c Baseline tumor assessment scans should be done 1 to 30 days before beginning treatment.  
d CT, MRI, or PET is acceptable for imaging assessment purposes   
e Pregnancy test may be done up to 48 hours before ALT-803 administration  
f See pharmacokinetic flow sheet for specific draw times 
g Blood for WB Immunophenotyping, IFN-γ ELISPOT, NK-cell function, plasma cytokines, Kyn/Trp ratio and serum Ab to ALT-803 must be drawn before  the patient receives 
ALT-803 infusions on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each treatment cycle.  
h Physical exam must always include neurological assessment. In addition, a funduscopic exam, conducted by the investigator with a hand-held ophthalmoscope, must be done 
prior to starting therapy (Cycle 1, Day 1, Week 1) and repeated if clinically indicated (See Section 6.0  for additional details) .  
iAdditional cycles beyond the 4th cycle may be considered for patients continuing to benefit and tolerating therapy, upon discussion among the sponsor and Principal Investigator. 
jOther labs include: Lactate dehydrogenase, magnesium, phosphate, CK and troponin I or T ; must be drawn before  and at 12 and 24 hours after the first ALT-803 dose. 
kCBC w/diff, plts (Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1); must be drawn before  and at 12 and 24 hours after the first ALT-803 dose.

Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 to 30 days before start of protocol therapy, as indicated in the study calendar, except for 
pregnancy testing, which must be performed within 48 hours prior to initial ALT-803 administration. Scans and x- rays must be performed within 
30 days before the start of therapy. In the event that the patient’s condition is changing, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 24 hours before initiating the next cycle of therapy. Please refer to the study calenda r below for specific timing of required evaluations.

 10. S TUDY CALENDAR 
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 to 30 days before start of protocol therapy, as indicated in the study calendar, except for pregnancy testing, 
which must be performed within 48 hours prior to initial ALT-803 administration. Scans and x- rays must be performed within 30 days before the start of 
therapy. In the event that the patient’s condition is changing, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 24 hours before initiating the next cycle of 
therapy. Please refer to the study calendar below for specific timing of required evaluations.

Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 to 30 days before start of protocol therapy, as indicated in the study calendar, except for pregnancy testing, 
which must be performed within 48 hours prior to initial ALT-803 administration. Scans and x- rays must be performed within 30 days before the start of 
therapy. In the event that the patient’s condition is changing, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 24 hours bef ore initiating the next cycle of 
therapy. Please refer to the study calendar below for specific timing of required evaluations.

with the new route of administration.  
2The dose of ALT -803 will be increased in increments of 5 μg/kg if a minimum of three patients have been treated 
at dose level 8  in Cohort 2 or dose level 3 in Cohort 3, and the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Optimum 
Biological Dose (OBD) have not been identified. Enrollment will continue until the MTD/OBD is identified.  
3Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 enrollment will occur in parallel. The treatment cohort assignment  (Cohort 2 vs Cohort 
3) is at the Investigator and patient discretion. Cohort 3 will be receiving both IT injection and SQ injections and 
must be amenable to undergoing pre and post -treatment biopsy.  
4Cohort 3, dose escalation only for the IT portion; SQ  dose remains constant at 15 µg/kg.

 10. STUDY CALENDAR  
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 to 30 days before start of protocol therapy, as indicated in the study calendar, except for pregnancy testing, 
which must be performed within 48 hours prior to initial ALT-803 administration. Scans and x- rays must be performed within 30 days before the start of 
therapy. In the event that the patient’s condition is changing, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 24 hours bef ore initiating the next cycle of 
therapy. Please refer to the study calendar below for specific timing of required evaluations.

NDC#  7425  A MULTI -CENTER, PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL TO EVALUATE  THE SAFETY AND 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CT LUCIA 611P POSTERIOR CHAM BER  
INTRAOCULAR LENS FOR CORRECTION OF APHAK IA  
FOLLOWING CATARACT REMOVAL  
(IDE 611 STUDY)  
PROTOCOL # CT LUCIA 611P ONT -301-17, VERSION E 
 
STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 1. Study Objective  
 
To establish the safety and effectiveness of the CT LUCIA  611P posterior chamber intraocular lens ( IOL) 
for the correction of  aphakia following extracapsular cataract extraction via phacoemulsification  in adult 
patients.   
 2. Study Device  
 
The CT LUCIA  611P is a posterior chamber  hydrophobic acrylic  IOL, which is  designed for implantation 
in the capsular bag following cataract extraction , contained in a BLUEJECT injector .  The IOL is a single -
piece design with 6.0 mm optic diameter and 13.0 mm overall diameter .  The optic of the CT LUCIA  611P 
is monofocal biconvex aspheric in design, with edges designed to minimize mass; the lens haptics are 
modified C-loop with 0 ° angulation. 
 3. Study Endpoints   
 
• Effectiveness:  The primary effectiveness endpoint is the proportion of subject  
 
 
• Safety: The primary safety endpoints are the incidence of adverse events (AE).   
 
4. Study Design    
   
This is a prospective, multi -center single -arm clinical study .  Subjects will be enrolled at approximately  15 
investigational sites  located in the U .S.  Only 1 eye per subject may receive the study device.  All subjects 
who undergo surgery and study device implantation will be followed for 12 months post- surgery.  
 5. Subject Population    
 Adult subjects undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction via phacoemulsification followed by  
implantation of a posterior chamber IOL.    6. Number of Eyes 
 390 eye s enrolled , with ≥  300 eyes followed through 12 months postoperatively.

NDC#  7425  7. Study Treatment   
 
Candidate patients will be screened to determine study eligibility, then examined to obtain their medical 
and ophthalmic history and establish baseline ocular condition. Qualified subjects wi ll undergo 
extracapsular cataract extraction via phacoemulsification follo wed by implantation with the 
CT LUCIA  611P IOL in the study eye.  Postoperatively, subjects will undergo protocol -specified 
ophthalmic examinations at regularly scheduled intervals. 
 
8. Examination Schedule  
 Scheduled examinations will be performed at the intervals shown below:      
 
• Pre-operative Visit ( -90 - 0 days)  
• Operative Visit (Day 0)     
• 1 Day Postoperative Visit (1 - 2 days post- surgery)   
• 1 Week Postoperative Visit (7 - 14 days post -surgery)                   
• 1 Month Postoperative Visit (30 - 60 days post-surgery)  
• 6 Months Postoperative Visit (120 - 180 days post-surgery) 
• 12 Months Postoperative Visit (330 - 420 days post- surgery)   
 
Note:  Unscheduled visits may occur at any time during the study participation period.  
     
9. Clinical Assessments/Procedures   
  
The following c linical assessments will be performed at scheduled examination visits as shown in  
APPENDIX 1:  SCHEDULE OF CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS/PROCEDURES : 
 
• Medical and ophthalmic history 
• Concomitant medication use 
• Study eye axial length (AL),  anterior chamber depth (ACD) and keratometry (K) measurement  
• Study eye cataract removal and I OL implantation information  
• Uncorrected and best- corrected distance VA  
• Manifest refraction  (MR) 
• Slit lamp examination  (SLE)  
• Dilated fundus examination  (DFE)  
• Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement  
• Adverse event  (AE)  determination  
 
Note:  Clinical assessments/procedures performed at unscheduled examination visits will be determined at the study investigator’s discretion.

NDC#  7425  10.  Study Duration                
 
The duration of each subject’s study participation is nominally estimated to be approximately 13 months; however, duration of participation is affected by t he time lapse between the Preoperative Visit, which 
may occur between Day -90 and Day 0, and the Operative Visit on Day 0.  Each subject will be followed 
for 12 months after the Operative Visit.  Of note, the 12-Month Visit may occur at any time between 11 
and 14 months postoperatively.    The total anticipated duration of this clinical investigation i s approximately 21  – 26 months.

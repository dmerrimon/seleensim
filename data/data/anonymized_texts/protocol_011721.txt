Protocol version: 8 3 Date: February 15, 2017 I. Background, Rationale and Context 
 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major health concer n in the United States, accounting for 90 to 95% 
of the more than 25 million diagnosed cases of diabetes in 20101.  The estimated healthcare 
burden in the United States for persons with di abetes was more than 150 billion dollars in 2010, 
making it one of the costliest chronic diseases2. Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of mortality 
from all causes, and is a major ri sk factor for cardiovascular disease, renal disease, blindness, 
and lower extremity amputations3. Because current treatment does not prevent a substantial 
proportion of these related complications, and application of proven therapies is inconsistent, prevention of diabetes mellitus is preferable to  reducing related sequelae once the disease is 
established. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by the diabetes epidemic, specifically African Americans , Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans
3.  
 In the last decade, several la rge clinical trials have demonstrated the potential for the 
prevention of diabetes through lifestyle chang e, primarily through interventions focused on 
weight loss, physical activity and nutrition
4,5. In the Diabetes Prev ention Program (DPP), a 
lifestyle intervention produced an average of 7%  weight loss and a 0.2% drop in glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) by year 2, and a decrease in the absolute risk of developing diabetes 
mellitus from 11.0 to 4.8 cases pe r 100 person-years of follow-up4.  This change was achieved 
through increased physical activity and reduced ca loric intake and was effective in reducing the 
incidence of diabetes mellitus by 58% amon g persons with impaired glucose tolerance4.  The 
intervention was delivered through a 16-lesson core curriculum taught by case managers on an 
individual basis over a 24 week period, afte r which participants entered a maintenance phase 
consisting of monthly individual and/or group sessions6. Based on these and other results, the 
American Diabetes Association, the North American Association for the Study of Obesity and 
the American Society for Clinical Nutrition i ssued a joint statement recommending weight 
management through lifestyle modification for the prevention of diabetes in 20047.   
 A number of recent studies have attempted to translate the DPP lifestyle intervention into community-based diabetes prev ention programs and have demonstrated encouraging effects 
across diverse settings, including primary care settings
8-10, cardiac rehabilitation programs11, 
churches12, YMCAs13, health care facilities14,15, and community-based facilities (e.g., parks and 
recreation centers)16.  Taken together, these interventions typically produce approximately 6% 
weight loss at one year of follow-up17. Although the cumulative evidence suggests that 
successful translations of the DPP can be implemen ted across a variety of settings with diverse 
personnel, numerous barriers to widespread diss emination of diabetes prevention programs in 
minority populations still exist.   This study is designed to address these ba rriers by further adapting a community-based 
lifestyle intervention for Latinos and we have identified several key elements to enhance 
logistical and fiscal feasibility and long-term diss emination: 1) identifying persons at risk using 
a diabetes risk screening tool followed by me asurement of HbA1c , 2) using a group-based, 
rather than an individual-based intervention that will be implemented by bilingual Latino Lay Health Advisors (LHAs), and 3) delivering th e intervention in a community-based setting. 
Latinos Combatiendo
 la Diabetes (La Comunidad) is a group-based, behavioral lifestyle 
intervention delivered by LHAs and integrat ed within the Latino community. It will be 
Protocol version: 8 4 Date: February 15, 2017 population-based, proactive and community member-centered, consistent with the chronic care 
model. 
 
II. Specific Aims 
 
Our central hypothesis is that a communit y-based lifestyle weight-loss intervention 
implemented within the accountabi lity and structure of existing  Latino communities will have a 
more beneficial and clinically meaningful impact  on HbA1c, insulin metabolism, and markers of 
the metabolic syndrome when compared to an enhanced usual care condition.     
1. The primary outcome is change in HbAlc.  
2. The secondary outcomes consist of clinical (body weight, blood pressure) and biochemical (glucose, HDL, triglycerides) markers of the metabolic syndrome. 
3. The tertiary outcomes include biomarkers of insulin sensitivity and inflammation (fasting insulin, homeostatic model asse ssment [HOMA], CRP, IL-6, leptin, 
adiponectin, expression of IL-8 in ci rculating mononuclear cells, Omega 3 and 6 
fatty acids, free fatty acids). 
4. We also plan to evaluate the program’s effect on health-related quality of life (HRQL) and determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in terms of the primary and major secondary outcomes.  
 
La Comunidad will provide much-needed info rmation regarding the effectiveness of a 
community-based, behavioral interv ention for the prevention of di abetes mellitus in Latinos. If 
the proposed approach is cost-effective, it will enable the rapid dissemination of this model to 
the many areas with Latino communities in the United States. Because many chronic diseases are influenced by activity and diet, this approach should translate into public health benefits in other areas (obesity, hypertension, cardiovascul ar disease) multiplying the potential social 
benefits and serving as a model for Latino community-based health promotion programs. Our overarching aim is translating evidence based, lifestyle strategies to eliminate health disparities in diabetes prevention.  
III.  Methods and Measures 
 
A. Overview of Study Design 
 
La Comunidad is a randomized clinical trial involving 225 Latino participants designed to 
further build upon the methods successfully implemented in the Healthy Living Partnerships to 
Prevent Diabetes (HELP PD)16,18,19 . Participants in the lifestyle weig ht loss group will take part 
in a group-based intervention aimed at achieving modest weight loss (5-7%) through promoting healthy eating and increasing physical activity. The intervention sessions will take place at churches and other community locations and wi ll be coordinated and facilitated by LHAs. 
Content will be delivered by the LHA using ed ucational materials (DVDs, workbook, etc.) 
provided by the research team. The lifestyle inte rvention will be delivered in 2 phases: Phase 1 
will last for 6 months and consist of weekly gr oup meetings; Phase 2 will last for 6-18 months 
(depending on date of randomization) and consist of one LHA-led group session or one 
telephone contact from the LHA per month.  Part icipants in this treatment arm will also receive 
individual visits with an RD du ring months 1, 3, and 6 of phase 1. Participants in the-enhanced 
Protocol version: 8 5 Date: February 15, 2017 usual care group will receive two individual sessi ons with an RD and monthly newsletters that 
focus on existing community resources.  
 
Participants will be Latino community-dwelling adul ts with pre-diabetes as defined by HbA1c 
of 5.7-6.5% and BMI of 25-45 kg/m2. Participants will be recruited and pre-screened from a 
variety of Latino community settings.  Screening activities will be conducted at churches and other community settings, with baseline and follow- up visits occurring in the Clinical Research 
Unit (CRU) of Wake Forest Ba ptist Medical Center or othe r WFBH facilities, including 
Lexington Medical Center, as needed. Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to one of the treatment conditions  described above. Follow-up exams will occur 
every 6 months to assess weight, laboratory para meters, and other measures of the intervention 
effect. Due to the nature of the lifestyle interv ention, neither participants nor project personnel 
can be masked to the participant’s intervention status; however, personnel performing laboratory tests and interpreting their results w ill be masked. The project will operate under the 
general oversight of the Maya Angelou Center fo r Health Equity and will use an external safety 
officer to monitor trial progress and participant safety.  
 
B. Conceptual Framework 
 
The proposed study is guided by a conceptual model that integrates key concepts from social cognitive theory and the literature surrounding group dynamics
20,21. Weight loss and fitness 
improvement achieved through a combination of modifying ea ting and physical activity 
behaviors is determined by the joint, reciprocal interaction of personal factors (e.g., beliefs and 
values), social influences (e.g., support and stra in), and features of the physical environment 
(e.g., structure and access to resources). The lifestyle intervention incorporates several 
components of social cognitive theory: self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and incentives.    
Self-efficacy refers to the extent to which in dividuals believe they can successfully perform 
specific behaviors, even when confronted with barriers. Research has shown that self-efficacy 
beliefs are determined by prior behavior, phys ical symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue), appetite, 
affect, and environmental/social factors. Because self-regulatory behaviors are important to 
successful behavior change, the intervention is desi gned to increase self-efficacy in relation to 
goal setting, self-monitoring, and other self-management skills.  
 
Outcome expectations refer to the anticipated costs and benefits of performing a specific behavior; people are more likely to approach a behavior if the perceived consequences of 
performing it have a favorable cost/benefit ratio.  In many instances, people simply do not have 
the knowledge to understand the negative heal th effects of being overweight or obese and 
sedentary or are unduly optimist ic about their own fate. Also, people often hold unrealistic 
expectations about how much weight they can lose through caloric restriction and increased energy expenditure and can become disappointed wh en the results from lifestyle interventions 
do not meet their expectations.   Incentives refer to the value that people associate with specific behavioral outcomes. 
Understanding the role of incentiv es on lifestyle behavior is a three step process. In relation to 
weight loss, one must understand (a) the desire that an individual has to lose weight, (b) the 
goal discrepancy or the degree of satisfaction/dissatisfaction between where one wants to be 
Protocol version: 8 6 Date: February 15, 2017 and his/her current weight, and (c) the value/commitment to competing behaviors such as 
responsibilities to families or friends.  
 
The effective use of and change in self-efficacy expectations, outcome expectations, and incentives in the context of lifestyle behavior change requires the acquisition and use of self-
regulatory skills in conjunction with a continuous problem-solving model of behavior change. Self-regulatory skills enable people to exert control over their behavior, cognitions, and 
environment and are an integral part of the lifestyle intervention.  
 
C. Setting 
 
a. Organization 
 
La Comunidad is a collaborative partnership betw een researchers from Wake Forest School of 
Medicine, Wake Forest University, and local Lati no churches and organizations throughout the 
community.   Churches in the Forsyth County, NC  area will serve as intervention sites in La 
Comunidad when possible.  A companion Manual of Procedures and Intervention Manual will 
provide specific operational details of th e project for all study personnel.    
 The study is managed through several committees with distinct roles and responsibilities. The 
Steering Committee, made up of the principal investigator, all co-investigators, and senior project staff, will meet monthly. The Steering Committee is responsible for the study protocol, 
definition of all study outcomes, data analysis confirmation, publications, content approval of the interventional materials, and data collection and management procedures. The Steering Committee assumes full responsibility for the sc ientific integrity of the study, including 
protection of human subjects and health in formation. This committee is responsible for 
requesting and reviewing study progress repo rts made by the other standing committees. 
 The Intervention Committee, made up of investig ators and with expertise in behavioral lifestyle 
interventions, including LHA training and supervision, will plan and oversee implementation of the intervention in La Comunidad.  The In tervention Committee will be responsible for the 
adaptation and translation of intervention materials and procedures and training and 
supervision of the LHAs.  This Committee w ill also be responsible for developing the 
intervention documentation procedures and for overseeing documentation of the process of 
intervention delivery.  The Intervention Committ ee will meet weekly early in the study and at 
least monthly throughout the course of the study.   
 The Recruitment and Retention Committee will be responsible for planning, implementing and 
overseeing the recruitment and retention plans for La Comunidad, including advertisements, 
mailings (including procurement of mailing lists ), development of telephone and in-person 
screening instruments and procedures, and scre ening, recruitment and retention monitoring 
reports.  This committee will also monitor all aspects of participant retention, including visit and procedure adherence and will develop strategi es and procedures to enhance retention of 
the LHAs.   This Committee will meet weekly  early in the study and at least monthly 
throughout the course of the study.  As we anticipate that our relationship with partnering churches and community organizations will be instrumental to the recruitment and retention of 
Protocol version: 8 7 Date: February 15, 2017 participants in La Comunidad, a member of the Pastoral Care team will be included on this 
committee.  
 
The Data Management Committee, made up of investigators and staff with special expertise in study design and analysis, will be responsible fo r development of data collection instruments, 
data management procedures and data analysis plans, including quality control reports and reports to the study’s safety officer.  This Co mmittee will meet weekly ea rly in the study and at 
least monthly throughout the course of the study.   
 
The Operations Committee, made up of the princi pal investigator and all research staff, meets 
weekly. This committee is charged with developi ng the Manual of Operations, reporting study 
progress, implementing the protocol as directed by the Steering Committee, including any changes, and ensuring that the intervention and data collection are proceeding according to the 
study timeline. 
 
It is expected that roles and recommendations of these committees may overlap in some areas; it is the responsibility of the Steering Committee to coordinate activities and reconcile any 
conflicting recommendations.  A schematic of st udy organization is included in Figure 2 and 
committee rosters are included in Appendix A.

b. Local Latino churches  
As churches continue to play an important role in the social structure of the Latino community 
in which there are long standing associations between religion and health, we plan to base many of our recruitment efforts in local churches  with large Latino popu lations. Local churches 
have been instrumental in establishing a system for health education in this community. We are 
also hopeful that we will be able to utilize ch urch facilities to hold screening events and 
intervention group sessions when possible. Five local churches have initially agreed to take part in the recruitment efforts for this study: Steering

• Iglesia Nueva Vida Pentecostal Church 
 
We will also identify other local churches and co mmunity groups that can play an integral role 
in the implementation and delivery of this intervention moving forward. 
 
D. Subjects selection criteria 
 The principles guiding the selection of the follo wing inclusion and exclusion criteria are to 
ensure the enrollment of participants who meet 3 major criteria: 1) high risk for developing diabetes, 2) no medical contraindications to pa rticipate in a lifestyle intervention including 
unsupervised physical activity and weight loss, and 3) ethical randomization, i.e., there are no 
compelling reasons that potential participants sh ould be referred for immediate weight loss. 
Subjects will include 225 overweight or obese adul ts with pre-diabetes in Forsyth County, NC 
and the surrounding area.  All participants will be  required to identify themselves as Hispanic 
or Latino and we hope to recruit approximat ely equal numbers of men and women based on 
their representation in the population of the ar ea.  As women are more likely to seek medical 
care than men, we anticipate at least 50% of our sample to be female.  We plan to make 
concerted efforts to ensure that no less than 40% of our sample is male.  
 
a. Inclusion Criteria 
 
• Demographics: Men and women 18 years of age and older who reside in or near Forsyth 
County, NC. 
• Ethnicity: self-identified as Hispanic or Latino 
• Evidence of pre-diabetes: HbA1c of 5.7-6.5% 
• Body Mass Index (BMI):  25-45 kg/m
2 
• Willingness to Accept Randomization:  Potent ial participants must be willing to accept 
randomization to either the intensive lifestyle  intervention or the comparison usual care 
condition. 
 
b. Exclusion Criteria 
 
• Weight Loss:  Currently involved in a supervised program for weight loss. 
• Diabetes:  Clinical history of diabetes mellit us, or newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus at 
screening.  
• Recent History of Cardiovascular Disease:  Clinical history of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) occurring within the past 6 months, including myocardial infarction, angina, 
coronary revascularization, stroke, TIA, caro tid revascularization, peripheral arterial 
disease, congestive heart failure. All persons with recent CVD should be participating in 
cardiac rehabilitation (with appropriate supervision as indicated) to reduce their risk of recurrence; hence, randomization might raise ethical concerns.  
Protocol version: 8 9 Date: February 15, 2017 • Hypertension:  Uncontrolled high blood press ure: BP > 160/100. Potential participants 
can be re-screened after control has been achieved.  
• Pregnancy:  Pregnancy, breast feeding, or planning pregnancy within 2 years. 
• Other Chronic Conditions:  Other chronic dise ase likely to limit lifespan to less than 2-3 
years, including any cancer requiring treatment in past 5 years except non-melanoma 
skin cancer.  
• Medication:  Chronic use of medicine known to significantly affect glucose metabolism 
(e.g., corticosteroids, protease inhibitors).  
• Other:  Conditions/criteria likely to interf ere with participation and acceptance of 
randomized assignment, including the following: inability/unwillingness to give informed consent, another household member  already randomized to La Comunidad, 
major psychiatric or cognitive problems (sch izophrenia, dementia, self-reported active 
illegal substance or alcohol abuse), participat ion in another research study that would 
interfere with La Comunidad.  
E. Screening and Randomization 
 
a. Tiered Screening Process 
 
A tiered screening process will be implemented to maximize the efficiency of screening. Interested prospective participants will be identified at the churches, community events, or by advertising, and will complete or be administered  an initial pre-screening tool to assess medical 
history and the diabetes risk screening tool de veloped by the American Diabetes Association
22. 
If potentially eligible, they will then be invited to take part in an interactive question and 
answer session to learn more about the study, fo llowed by the informed consent process.  Those 
participants still interested and eligible will then have  their height, weight, and blood pressure 
measured and will complete the physical activi ty readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q).  Those 
participants who have met all ot her eligibility criteria will then have a blood draw to determine 
HbA1c.  Figure 2 outlines the screening process that we plan to implement.  
 
Figure 2. Tiered Screening Process for La Comunidad 
 

Protocol version: 8 10 Date: February 15, 2017 b. Randomization 
 
Potential participants who 1) satisfy the inclusio n/exclusion criteria previously described, and 
2) provide a signed informed consent will be invited to the CRU or Lexington Medical Center to complete a baseline visit and be randomized to one of the treatment conditions. The number of 
participants recruited and randomized during a given month will vary, depending both on the 
flow of interested participants into the screening process and the needs/limitations of the lifestyle intervention arm of the study. We anticipate LHA-led intervention groups of 10-15 
participants and for the intervention to begin within one month of randomization. We will 
recruit participants in waves to ensure that th ere are sufficient numbers to fill intervention 
groups. We will adopt a permuted block design wi th varying block size, as this can lower the 
time randomized individuals wait for interventi on groups to develop and ensure a degree of 
balance. A list of random study arm assignments will be generated and used by the web based 
randomization routine to make sequential a ssignments. Randomization will occur in a 2:1 
pattern; for every two participants randomized to the lifestyle intervention, one will be randomized to the usual care group. Table 2 illustrates that the 225 participants will be 
recruited in 11 distinct waves with 20-21 in each  wave.  We anticipate the recruitment period 
lasting from the latter part of Year 1 through Year 3. Based on our 2:1 randomization, approximately 14 participants will be randomized to the intervention condition in each wave. 
We anticipate a total of 11 LHA-led groups.

F. La Comunidad Lifestyle Weight Loss Intervention 
a. Goals of the Lifestyle Intervention   
The lifestyle intervention is designed to induce weight loss by creating an energy deficit.  This 
will be achieved by decreasing daily caloric in take and increasing daily caloric expenditure 
through moderate intensity physical activity. We  will advise participants to adapt a low-calorie 
eating pattern, with a goal daily deficit of  500 to 1000 kcal, coupled with an increase in 
moderate intensity physical activity, by walk ing for 30 minutes on most days. The primary 
treatment objectives for the weight loss compon ent of the intervention will be to decrease 
caloric intake in a nutritionally sound manner so  as to produce a weight loss of approximately 
0.3 kg per week for the first 6-months of treatment for a total weight loss of 5-7%. After that, participants will be encouraged to continue weight loss as long as their BMI does not fall below 20 kg/m
2, but the primary focus will be on weight maintenance. The primary objective for the 
physical activity component of the intervention  will be to promote an increase in home-based 
energy expenditure to an eventu al goal of 180 minutes per week. The intervention will be 
tailored to the unique needs of each participant, with daily calorie goals ranging from 1200-1800 
calories based on weight. 
Protocol version: 8 11 Date: February 15, 2017  
b. Structure of the Lifestyle Intervention 
 
The lifestyle intervention will be a modified vers ion of the DPP intervention adapted for use in 
groups, as used in both Look AHEAD and HELP PD16,19. The core content was integrated into a 
DVD video series for HELP PD to assist with standardization of intervention delivery. These 
DVDs contain information on the physiological, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral basics of 
losing weight as well as adopting and maintaining an active lifestyle. Each DVD segment also 
has a series of questions that are then a ddressed in the LHA-led group sessions. The 
intervention, including the DVDs, will be ad apted and culturally-tailored to make it 
comfortable and relevant to Latino participants. The physical activity program will be 
progressive and will focus on walking and other la rge muscle activities. Physical activity bouts 
of ten minutes and longer will be counted toward  the physical activity goal, but occupational 
activity will not be counted towards the physical  activity goal. We will also provide pedometers 
to enable participants to self-monitor their phys ical activity and to set goals for progressively 
increasing their activity level. Within 3 months of study onset, the goal will be to have participants engaging in 30 minutes or more of moderate intensity activity, for a total of 180 
minutes per week. Specific components of the lif estyle intervention are outlined in Table 2.

Protocol version: 8 12 Date: February 15, 2017 c. Empowered Community Partners: Latino Health Advisors  
 
We plan to deliver the intervention using LHAs  from the local community, many of whom are 
part of an established network of Latino LHAs that  were identified by their churches because of 
their leadership skills and community recognition.  We will supplement this core group of LHAs 
with recommendations from our investigative team and study dietitian, as we did previously in 
HELP PD. The LHAs used in La Comunidad will be  adults with a history of diabetes mellitus, 
pre-diabetes, or metabolic syndrome that have been successful in achieving and maintaining 
lifestyle changes related to diet and physical ac tivity. They must also have a desire to help 
community members who are at risk for develo ping diabetes by leading them through a 
weight-loss and lifestyle change program, demonstr ate leadership ability, and be able to devote 
at least 10 hours per week to the program. Th e LHA’s that participate in the network have 
already received structured training at WFUSM (80 hours) for delivering medical education to 
their communities in topics related to diab etes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular 
disease, and were tested for knowledge proficiency before and after training.  
 In La Comunidad, all LHAs will receive 36 hours of training over 4-6 weeks. Major components include: (a) instruction on appropriate diabetes  prevention messages, (b) basic counseling skills 
(e.g., active listening and the basics of group dynamics), (c) how to teach and reinforce self-regulatory skills, (d) overview and use of the inte rvention materials, (e) a 5-step approach to 
problem solving that has been used successful ly in many weight loss trials, and (f) the 
structure/goals of telephone contacts. At the end of training, there will be a formal certification process involving a criterion-based assessment of (a) their skills running groups and handling situations within the group, (b) knowledge rega rding the intervention pr otocol and use of the 
treatment manual, and (c) competence in comple ting requisite forms. The training will be 
provided by registered dietitians, one of whom was responsible for training community health workers in HELP PD. In addition to this trai ning, the study RD will meet monthly with the 
LHAs to discuss intervention implementation an d participant progress to maintain consistency 
across LHAs. Our real-time web-based data re porting system will enable us to monitor 
intervention delivery by the LHAs, as reflected by participant attendance, adherence measures, 
and, eventually, outcomes.   
d. Intervention Group: LHA Sessions   
The peer group counseling sessions will last ab out 60 minutes and will include 3 segments. The 
first segment will review participants’ progress in implementing strategies recommended for 
changing their diet or physical ac tivity in the previous session. After a private weigh-in (scales 
will be provided for each LHA), participants w ill describe the progress they have achieved, and 
they will identify any problems they might have encountered. Good progress will be highlighted with strong positive feedback. Difficulties will be dealt with through group support and advice. The second segment will focus on skill training related to cognitive-behavioral self-
management skills, nutrition training , or exercise science. This core content will be delivered 
and discussed via the DVD series. Additional educational material s will be made available in a 
“toolkit” to enhance the activities as approp riate. The final component will consist of a 
discussion of the next week’s goals. Each participant will be asked to identify specific 
behavioral goals for the next period and will receive feedback and encouragement from the long-term weight management 
Protocol version: 8 13 Date: February 15, 2017 group.  We anticipate holding all LHA sessions in community settings, starting with the 
churches that have agreed to participate previously. We also plan to identify other churches and 
community settings (recreation centers, communi ty centers, YMCAs, etc) as needed to 
accommodate additional LHA-led groups.   
 
e. Evaluation of the Lifestyle Intervention 
 The success of this intervention will be dependent,  in part, on our ability to monitor the fidelity 
of intervention delivery. The DVD series will also serve to enhance treatment fidelity by standardizing delivery of the intervention content.   We will monitor and track the following: a) 
adherence to LHA-led group meetings and make-up sessions, b) weight at all sessions, c) self-monitoring data from the participants concerning dietary intake and physical activity behaviors, and d) phone contacts during the maintenance phase of the study. The RD will 
supervise the LHAs, collate data from individual interactions with participants, and provide 
written and verbal feedback to LHAs that can be shared with participants. Members of the 
intervention committee will provide ongoing su pport and monitor intervention progress, 
thereby providing ongoing access to expertise in nutrition, behavioral, and exercise science. 
 
G. Comparison Condition 
 
Our comparison intervention condition is designed  to exceed the usual care provided to similar 
community members and to enh ance retention. Our comparison intervention will be an 
individual education program that builds on an increased awareness of existing community 
resources. Comparison participants will receive 2 sessions with an RD during the first 6 months. 
The RD will cover basic aspects of healthy eati ng and activity to support weight loss, and 
discuss existing community resources.   In addi tion to this, participants will receive a monthly 
newsletter that includes information on nutrition, physical activity, and healthy living.  
 
H. Data Collection 
 
We plan to collect all screening data for this st udy in community location s (churches, recreation 
centers, etc).  Those participants that meet all eligibility criteria and provide informed consent 
will complete baseline and follow-up visits at the CRU or Lexington Medical Center.  To enable 
assessment of the process of implementation, impact and outcomes of the intervention, data will be collected at both the individual and program levels. At the individual level, we will 
collect information regarding demographics, anthropometry (height, weight, and waist), blood 
pressure, pulse, medical history, health  behaviors (diet, physical activity), 
 health-related quality of life (HRQL), healthca re resource utilization and cost. We will also 
obtain blood samples to measur e HbA1c, glucose, insulin, and lipids and to store for future 
uses. At the program level, we will collect data related to implementation and cost.  A schedule 
of data collection visits for participants is outlin ed in Table 3. Participants will be followed from 
the baseline/randomization visit through 24 months or June 30, 2017 (for those participants randomized after July 2015). Anticipated participation in the study will be at least one year for all randomized participants. Study questionnaires will be included in Appendix B as developed/purchased and approved by the Steering Committee.

a. Demographics and Anthropometry 
 
Age (date of birth), gender, race and ethnicity (US Census Definition), and names and contact 
information for at least 2 informants will be colle cted. Weight (nearest 0.1 kg), height (nearest 
0.5 cm), minimum waist (nearest 0.5 cm) will be  measured using standardized methodology as 
used in HELP PD.  
b. Blood Pressure  
Blood pressure will be measured using an au tomated device (Omron HEM 907XL) following 
standardized procedures as outlined in current clinical practice guidelines. Use of an automated device reduces measurement variability and errors . The presence of hypertension at baseline 
and follow-up will be assessed using a combination of BP measurement, self-reported diagnosis and use of antihypertensive medication.  
c. Medical History 
Protocol version: 8 15 Date: February 15, 2017  
During screening, medical history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other medical 
conditions will be obtained to evaluate the in clusion and exclusion criteria. During follow-up, 
new diagnoses of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and other chronic diseases, 
unexpected problems, serious adverse events w ill be tracked. Deaths will be identified by 
following up missed appointments with contacts to the participant’s residence and informants.  
d. Laboratory Measures 
 Phlebotomy will be performed by trained, cert ified phlebotomists.  Specimen collection at 
baseline and follow-up visits will be performed follo wing at least an 8 hour fast (typically over 
night) in accordance with American Diabetes Association guidelines. Blood samples for plasma glucose will be collected in vacutainers containi ng sodium fluoride in order to minimize post 
collection changes due to glycolysis and will be stored at room temperature until processed. 
Samples for HbA1c, glucose, insulin, and lipids will be collected and transported to the local 
LabCorp facility for analysis.  Communications wi th LabCorp and requisitions for these assays 
will be facilitated through the CRU’s existing contract with LabCorp.  Plasma and serum 
samples will be retained for future analysis of CRP,  IL-6, leptin, adiponectin, expression of IL-8 
in circulating mononuclear cells, Omega 3 and 6 fa tty acids, free fatty acids.   We will also 
collect sufficient blood samples to isolate DNA and may perform genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS). These analyses are included in the specific aims, but samples with which to 
conduct these analyses will be stored in Dr. Chilt on's laboratory until additional funding can be 
obtained.   
e. Diet Assessment 
 
Usual dietary intake will be assessed using a wi dely-used food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). 
The FFQ provides estimates of macronutrients, mi cronutrients, and servings of particular foods 
of interest, and has been validated against food records. Although the FFQ has shortcomings, 
such as potential underestimation of energy, it  is the most practical instrument for large 
intervention studies and has become the most common method for measuring usual dietary 
intake. Its low cost and ease of administration are also important considerations.  
In addition, diet will be monitored daily by the intervention participants through completion of their diet and physical activity logs. The precis ion of the FFQ is sufficient to enable us to 
evaluate intervention group differences in diet.  
f. Physical Activity  
Throughout the lifestyle intervention, physical activity will be monitored via logs that are 
collected by the LHAs and data entered by members of the research study team. These logs include a record of the frequency and duration of physical activity and daily steps that are self-
monitored using pedometers. In addition, at as sessment visits, we will use the International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire to evaluate be tween group differences in physical activity, an 
internationally reliable and valid instrument for assessing physical activity.  The IPAQ short 
form is a 7-item index that asks respondents the number of days per week and the amount of time per day spent in vigorous- and moderate-intensity activities and walking, during the seven days prior to the interview.   Different levels  of physical activity are assigned metabolic 
Protocol version: 8 16 Date: February 15, 2017 equivalent (MET) scores based on the Compen dium of Physical Activity and, using MET-
minutes, can be converted to both continuous and categorical values.   
 
 
g.  Self-Efficacy  
There are a series of four brief measures based on social cognitive theory that address 1) barriers efficacy for physical activity and weight loss, 2) task efficacy related to specific physical 
capacities and weight loss, 3) satisfaction with  physical function and body appearance and 4) 
the desire to be physically competent and to lose varying percentages of weight (converted to pounds on an individual basis).  These measures will be collected at baseline and all follow-up visits for all participants and are included in Appendix B.    
h. Health-Related Quality of Life 
 Two common HRQL instruments – the Short Form 36 items (SF-36) and Health Utilities Index - 3 (HUI 3) will be used in La Comunidad. The SF-36 is the most widely used general health 
status measure with extensive validation and popu lation norms available. It allows comparison 
of the planned study population with those of other studies and other chronic diseases. Eight scale scores will be generated in the following do mains: general health, physical function, role-
physical, role-emotional, vitality, social function, mental health, and pain. It can also be scored 
in terms of physical health and mental health component scores. The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) system is a generic HRQL in strument which was developed not only for 
measuring health status but also for economic  evaluation. HUI3 includes a health-status 
classification system and a pref erence-based scoring formula. The HUI3 has eight attributes 
(vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition, and pain) with five to six 
levels per attribute. The multiplicative multi-a ttribute utility function for the HUI3 system can 
be used to generate utility scores for use in economic analysis.   
i. Cost 
 
The cost of La Comunidad will be separated into research and intervention costs. Research costs 
will be excluded from the economic evaluation. The intervention costs will be classified into 
direct medical, direct nonmedical, and indirect costs. The identification and measurement of the 
cost of a health prevention program can be determined from four different perspectives: 
individual, health care provider, third party payer (including large health care systems, 
insurers, government, etc.), and society. In La  Comunidad, we will adopt the perspectives of 
individuals, third party payers and society in th ree separate analyses, as all three perspectives 
will influence successful dissemination. From th e individual’s perspective, the total cost 
estimation will include participants’ out of pock et expenses, and cost associated with travel 
time and missed working days due to illness. In the third party payer pers pective, we will only 
include the direct medical costs (including the intervention) in the total cost estimation. The 
participants’ out of pocket expenses and indirect  cost such as missed working days will not be 
included. In the societal perspective, the total cost will constitute all direct and indirect costs 
incurred by participants and the third-party paye rs. In order to assure comparability to both 
DPP and HELP PD, we will apply similar criteria  for determining costs. Direct medical costs 
Protocol version: 8 17 Date: February 15, 2017 include the cost of implementation and maintenance of the intervention and the cost of 
utilization of medical services by study participants. We will assess the personnel resource use 
and cost in the comparison and lifestyle in tervention groups, including personnel time, 
mailings and telephone calls using standardized questionnaires admi nistered to the staff. Unit 
cost for personnel will be calculated as the medi an salaries of personnel employed by the study 
team with a fringe benefit rate. Unit costs of health education materials will be based on actual 
reproduction rates. Unit costs of laboratory te sts will be based on the Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) reimburs ement rates. Overhead costs will be estimated by multiplying 
personnel costs related to the intervention by the institutional rate negotiated with NIH. The proposed intervention may have an impact on the use of medical services outside La Comunidad, including hospital, emergency department, outpatient clinic, physician office, and medications. A resource utilization questionnaire  will be administered to participants semi-
annually, inquiring about hospital admissions, length of stay, nu mber of emergency department 
(ED) and physician office visits, and medicati ons used. Unit costs of hospital admissions, 
hospital days, ED visits, and physician’s o ffice visits will be based on CMS average 
reimbursements, respectively. Unit costs of me dications will be based on average wholesale 
prices available on the internet. This questi onnaire will also inquire about purchases of 
equipment -and memberships in health facilitie s and other related direct nonmedical costs. 
These and other direct nonmedical costs incl uding transportation to clinic, waiting and 
participation time will be estimated using the D PP direct nonmedical cost estimation methods
23. 
Indirect costs include participants’ productivi ty losses such as working days missed due to 
health reasons, and will be estimated base d on the median hourly wage, as in DPP23. 
 
I. Documentation 
 La Comunidad will develop a Manual of Procedur es (MOP), an LHA Intervention Manual (IM), 
and participant manuals. More comprehensive than this protocol, the MOP will include the 
protocol as its first chapter and will provide the specifics of study conduct. It will be modified 
during the study if any changes in the data fo rms and data collection techniques are necessary. 
The MOP will contain detailed information on th e study’s conduct, including comprehensive 
descriptions of recruitment, enrollment, random ization, data collection, monitoring and follow-
up procedures. It is meant to be the "how-to" manual and the source of information regarding 
the day-to-day operation of the study. A separate manual, the IM, will be developed for LHA 
training, intervention conduct, and stand ardization purposes. Comprehensive detailed 
guidelines for the dietary, exercise and behavioral interventions will be in the IM and serve as the basis for the intervention monitoring syst em. Participant manuals will supplement the IM. 
The MOP and IM will be developed prior to the first training session.  
J. Database Management System 
 To facilitate data transfer and preserve records that can be audited, we plan to use paper forms 
for data collection and remote data entry via an internet-based web browser interface. As in 
HELP PD, electronic data will be managed centrally, with a feedback mechanism through e-mail and web-based reporting. Data reside on th e server in a Microsoft SQL Server relational 
database. Cold Fusion middleware, a web applicat ion development tool, will be used to link the 
web-based forms interface to the SQL Server da tabase. SAS/Access is used to translate data 
from the SQL Server database to SAS data sets, which reside on a UNIX-based Sun 
Protocol version: 8 18 Date: February 15, 2017 Microsystems server. Validation checks are applie d during the data entry process. Insofar as 
possible, checks are programmed and made as the st aff enter data from each form, so that errors 
on the forms are corrected on-site at this early stage. These include intra-form and inter-form 
checks for consistency of responses, range chec king, and checks for required fields and skip 
patterns.   Our internet based data entry sy stem will protect confidentiality and data security. A very high 
level of data encryption during transmission co upled with the use of acrostics and study ID 
numbers, rather than subject names , provides adequate data security. The use of text containing 
identifying information will be avoided. We  will implement standard protection against 
computer hackers. Our site will offer neither spec ial challenges nor sensational data for hackers. 
This lack of inducements may decrease the chance that it will be targeted.   
K. Methods for Ensuring High Data Quality and Integrity 
 Quality control (QC) is a shared responsibility am ong all staff. The impact of La Comunidad on 
diabetes in the Latino population depends on the integrity of its impl ementation: maintaining 
randomization integrity, assessing participant eligibility accurately, recording dropouts and 
adherence, measuring outcome variables without bias, preventing premature leaks of results, 
monitoring and assessing protocol adherence, and avoiding biases in the analyses. In order to deal effectively with these important issues, adaptations of models for QC systems currently utilized in many of our ongoing studies will help us establish the QC system for La Comunidad. QC procedures will be devised to monitor screen ing, data collection, follow-up, clinical and 
biochemical measurements, forms control and da ta entry procedures, implementation of the 
intervention and overall operations. 
 
IV. Analytical Plan 
 
All statistical analyses will be conducted by the Research Core of the Maya Angelou Center for 
Health Equity. The main hypothesis being tested involves evaluating the mean differences in 
changes in HbA1c at one year.   Secondary outcomes include changes in c linical characteristics 
and biochemical lab results and biomarkers of insulin sensitivity. Statistically, all of these 
analyses could be treated in a similar fashion after appropriate transformations are made to 
satisfy assumptions made  about the distribution of residuals. We will apply a repeated 
measures analysis of variance to changes (collect ed across the planned visits at 6, 12, 18, and 24 
months) to address intra-individual correlati ons, which accommodates interim testing and 
allows participants with incomplete patterns to  contribute to the analysis and evaluation24. Our 
analysis adopts the intention-to-treat approach . Inference for primary comparisons will be two-
sided, with significance level alpha = 0.05. We will use repeated measures analysis of covariance 
in which indicators for visit are included to cont rol for systematic temporal differences that may 
occur that are common to both intervention condit ions. We test differences from baseline (rather 
than using baseline levels as a covariate in analyses  of post-randomization values), as it is these 
differences that are the focus of our intervention and to limit the bias associated with estimates 
from regression models that include fallible co variates. Random effects terms will be used to 
model differences as these have been shown to yi eld inferences of more appropriate size than 
fixed effect models. Compound symmetry mode ls will be used to model intra-subject 
Protocol version: 8 19 Date: February 15, 2017 longitudinal covariance and models will be fitted via maximum likelihood. The primary 
comparison will be based on a Wald statistic. We will not include additional covariates or 
stratification in the primary comparison, howe ver, we will describe any chance differences 
between cohorts and, in supporting analyses, covary comparisons on any baseline factors that 
appear to be unbalanced. When we are developing the ANCOVA models, we will determine whether the assumptions of general linear models are satisfied. Diagnostics and residual plots 
will be reviewed to ensure that the assumpti ons are met. Should assumptions be violated, 
transformations of the outcome data will be consid ered:  the order of the priority in choosing a 
transformation will be to satisfy the (1) linearity assumption, (2) ho mogeneity assumption 
(homoscedasticity), and (3) normality assumption . As mentioned above, secondary (supporting) 
analyses will assess the influence of covariates on the mean differences and to explore whether mean differences vary over follow-up time (usi ng interaction terms). In addition, we will 
explore the homogeneity of LHAs with respect to outcome measures us ing hierarchical mixed 
models in which LHAs are coded as random effects and participant data are nested within 
LHAs. Such models will allow us to place conf idence bounds on the contributions of LHA 
differences to overall variability. 
 Sample Size and Power 
 
In this section we justify our plans to recruit and follow 225 participants who will be 
randomized with equal probability to either the intensive lifestyle  intervention or individual 
education arm. Our goal is to provide greater than 80% statistical power to detect an average 
difference of .25 standard deviations from baseline in HbA1c between the two groups at one 
year.  With a sample size of 225 participant s, we will have 85-88% power to detect a net 
intervention effect of .25%.  These estimates in clude allowance for a 5% loss to follow-up rate 
every 6 months. Although the DPP has not published any data that allow us to estimate the 
standard deviation and longitudinal correlation of HbA1c, similar studies conducted for a 
longer period of time have estimated the aver age change in A1c to be .74% with a standard 
deviation of 1.25% for an effect size of .59.   
 
V. Human Subjects Protection 
 
A. Potential Risks to Subjects 
 
The risk to participants is modest, consisting primarily of the risk of increased moderate 
physical activity. Adoption of a vigorous activity regimen can increase the risk of 
cardiovascular events in sedent ary individuals. The other minor risks include risks associated 
with phlebotomy and confidentiality concerns. Phlebotomy carries a small risk of vasovagal 
syncope (fainting), hematoma formation and phlebotomy site infection.  
 
B. Protection against Risks  
 
Approval to proceed with this project will be sought from the WFUHS Institutional Review 
Board (IRB). We will submit an informed consen t document, including HIPAA authorization, as 
part of our application for approval. The risks inhe rent in the project consist mainly of the small 
risk of a cardiovascular event associated with adopting a moderate intensity physical activity regimen, the risk of phlebotomy and confidentia lity concerns. The risk of the physical activity 
Protocol version: 8 20 Date: February 15, 2017 program will be minimized by focusing on moderate, as opposed to vigorous, activity and by 
stressing a start slow and increase slowly a pproach. We will be encouraging participants to 
adopt brisk walking as the foundation of their activity program and we will educate 
participants about the potential risks of increase d activity. Potential participants will also be 
screened using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire. Persons who screen positive will 
be required to obtain medical clearance from a pr imary care provider prior to participation. All 
potential participants will be encouraged to di scuss participation with their usual physician 
prior to enrolling in La Comunidad. An informational brochure will be developed so that 
potential participants can review and discuss the program with their physician, and if he/she 
does not have a physician, he/she will be referred  to a source of care in the community.  This 
brochure will be provided to the IRB for approval  prior to use. The risk of phlebotomy will be 
minimized through the use of trained professional phlebotomists. The blood volume obtained 
at any phlebotomy will be no more than 20 mL. Risks related to inadvertent release of confidential information will be minimized th rough adherence to best practices for data 
collection and management. All research staff will be trained in methods for assuring participant confidentiality and safety. The informat ion we are collecting is not of a particularly 
sensitive nature and we will follow exacting pr ocedures to maintain confidentiality of the 
participant level data. Identifyin g information will be kept separa te from research data and will 
be linked only by a participant ID, generated so as to be independent of any identifying 
information. The linking report and personal  identifying data will be destroyed after 
completion of the study. No identifying information will be released in any published reports.    
C. Potential Benefits and Importance of Knowledge to be Gained 
 
The potential direct benefits to participants incl ude the decreased risk of developing diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease. In the DPP, the risk of developing diabetes was 11% per year in the 
“usual care” group. This risk was decreased by over 50% in the intensiv e lifestyle intervention 
group. In the HELP PD study, the group-based intervention showed significant weight loss and 
improvements in glucose. La Comunidad is design ed to move the intervention tested in HELP 
PD into the Latino community, improving diabetes prevention efforts. The development of diabetes carries with it significant morbidity and  mortality risk. Persons with diabetes are at an 
increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, in a ddition to increased risk of blindness, kidney 
failure and lower extremity amputation. The small risks of an acute cardiovascular event triggered by moderate physical activity should be  far offset by the substantial potential benefit 
of diabetes prevention. Other potential benefits to subjects may include improved quality of life and satisfaction with self-image. Little direct bene fit is expected to others; however, as persons 
with diabetes may impose some care-giver burden on others due to their need for frequent medical attention, it is possible that there will be some benefit related to decreased care-giver 
burden.  The knowledge to be gained in the proposed tria l relates to our ability to implement evidence-
based lifestyle interventions in different populations. As discusse d above, the risks of diabetes 
are substantial and the potential benefits for preven ting diabetes are great at the societal level; 
hence, the risk that participants will assume by pa rticipating in this program should be offset by 
the potential for public health benefit that would occur following dissemination of a successful diabetes prevention program. Fu rthermore, this approach could also serve as a model for other 
Protocol version: 8 21 Date: February 15, 2017 community-based health promotion programs in the Latino community, further enhancing the 
potential societal benefit of the proposed project. 
 
 
VI. Subject Recruitment Methods 
 
Participants will be recruited to La Comunida d using a mixture of advertising, community 
recruitment events, and provider referrals from healthcare sites. Given the unique role that 
churches play in the Latino community, we plan  to initiate our recruitment efforts there.  
Currently, 5 local churches have agreed to serve as partners for this effort and we plan to 
identify additional churches in the future.  We will also request a list of adult patients seen in 
outpatient primary care clinics at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center who have no diagnosis of 
diabetes and for whom ethnicity is recorded as “ Hispanic or Latino”.  This list will be requested 
from the Enterprise Data Warehouse through th e Translational Science Institute and will be 
used to generate mailings to potential participants . As a part of this data request, we will also 
request a limited waiver of HIPAA authorization from the IRB and the list generated will only 
be used under this waiver.  We will also plan to post flyers and posters in the Downtown 
Health Plaza space to supplement these effort s. All flyers, brochures, letters, and other 
recruitment materials will be submitted to the IRB of Wake Forest University Health Sciences 
for approval prior to use.  Signed informed co nsent will be obtained from all participants prior 
to conducting any screening acti vities. Copies of the signed consent forms will be provided to 
all participants. The original signed forms will be kept in study files. 
 We plan to identify local adults who identify th emselves as Latino who are at high risk for 
developing type 2 diabetes.  Primary incl usion criteria include BMI of 25-45 kg/m
2 and 
evidence of pre-diabetes (based on HbA1c).  C andidates will also be screened for co-morbid 
conditions that would make physical activity unsafe or limit participation in the study, 
including recent history of an acute cardiovascular disease event, clinical history of diabetes mellitus, cancer or other conditions limiting life expectancy, and major psychiatric or cognitive problems, including depression. For safety purposes, potential participants will also be screened using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q). Persons who screen positive on the PAR-Q will be required to obtain medical clearance from a physician prior to participation.  
 
  
VII. Informed Consent 
 
Signed informed consent will be obtained from ea ch subject after pre-screening but prior to the 
collection of any blood samples or other phys ical measurements.  Participants who speak 
Spanish as their primary language will be prov ided with Spanish-langua ge consent forms and 
will be consented by a study data collector who is fluent in Spanish. All potential participants 
will be informed of the study design and interventions, the risks and benefits of participation, 
their rights and responsibilities as research participants, and alternatives to participation. 
Participants will be required to sign an informed consent document prior to screening and enrollment. HIPAA authorization to collect and share personal health information within the 
investigative group is included in the consent fo rm and will be fully explained as part of the 
Protocol version: 8 22 Date: February 15, 2017 consent process.  For those participants who choose to allow us to store blood samples for 
future analysis of inflammatory markers, a se parate sub-study consent will be administered 
during the baseline visit.  
 
 
VIII.  Confidentiality and Privacy 
 
Confidentiality will be protected by collectin g only information needed to assess study 
outcomes, minimizing to the fulle st extent possible the collection of any information that could 
directly identify subjects, and maintaining all st udy information in a secure manner.  To help 
ensure subject privacy and confidentiality, two unique study identifiers will appear on the data 
collection forms.  Any collected patient identi fying information corresponding to the unique 
study identifier will be maintained on a linkage file, store separately from the data.  The linkage 
file will be kept secure, with access limited to designated study personnel.  The linking report 
and personal identifying data will be destroyed wi thin 3 years of completion of the study. This 
is consistent with accepted practices for data validation and study design, and will enable us to 
produce an anonymous analytical data set.  Data a ccess will be limited to study staff.  Data and 
records will be kept locked and secured, with  any computer data password protected.  No 
reference to any individual participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that 
may arise from the study.    
IX. Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The principal investigator will be  responsible for the overall monitoring of the data and safety 
of study participants.  The principal investigator  will be assisted by other members of the study 
staff and an independent safety officer (Krist en Hairston, MD) will be used to adjudicate 
adverse events and monitor study progress. As weight loss and weight fluctuation have been 
associated with increased morbidity and mortalit y, all hospitalizations will be monitored. In 
addition, potential adverse effects of the interven tion specific to physical exercise, primarily 
injuries and orthopedic conditions, will be monitored. All serious adverse events and 
unexpected problems will be reco rded on adverse event reporting forms, including action 
taken. A semi-annual report will be compiled and will include a list and summarization of any 
adverse events. In addition, these reports w ill address (1) whether adverse event rates are 
consistent with pre-study assumptions; (2) reason  for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all 
participants met entry criteria; (4) whether continuati on of the study is justified on the basis that 
additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions 
whereby the study might be terminated prematurely. These reports will be provided to both the study safety officer and the IRB.   
 
A. Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations 
 
Any unanticipated problems, serious and/or unexpe cted adverse events, deviations or protocol 
changes will be promptly reported by the princi pal investigator or designated member of the 
research team to the safety officer, IRB and NIH if appropriate.

Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) 
 
Becoming more active is very safe for most people, but just to be certain, please complete the 
questionnaire below.  Some people should check with their doctor before they start becoming much more physically active.  Start by answering the seven questions below.     
 
1. Has your doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and that you should only do 
physical activity recommended by a doctor? 
 YES   NO 
 
2. Do you feel pain in your chest when you do physical activity? 
 YES   NO 
 
3. In the past month, have you had chest pain when you were not doing physical activity? 
 YES   NO 
 
4. Do you lose your balance because of di zziness or do you ever lose consciousness? 
 YES   NO 
 
5. Do you have a bone or joint problem that could be made worse by a change in your 
physical activity? 
 YES   NO 
 6. Is your doctor currently prescribing drugs (for example, water pills) for your blood 
pressure or heart condition? 
YES   NO 
 
7. Do you know of any other reason why you should not do physical activity? 
 YES   NO 
 
 If you answered YES  to one or more questions, talk with your doctor before you start 
becoming much more physically active.  If you answered NO  to all questions, you can be reasonably sure that you can start 
becoming more physically active right now.  Be  sure to start slowly and progress gradually- 
this is the safest and easiest way to go.

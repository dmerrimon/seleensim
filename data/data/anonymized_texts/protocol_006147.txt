Study Title : Acupuncture Therapy for COVID -Related  Olfactory Loss  
 
Protocol version number  and date: Version 1 – March 2 3rd, 2021      
 
Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis : There will be no difference in improvement in olfaction in patients with COVID -related  olfactory 
loss treated with acupuncture , steroid rinses, and olfactory retraining compared to those treated with steroid 
rinses and olfactory retraining.  
 
Aims, purpose , or objectives:  
 
Aim 1: Describe the incidence of COVID -related olfactory loss . 
Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of acupuncture , steroid rinses, and olfactory training versus steroid rinses and 
olfactory training in the treatment of COVID -related  olfactory loss . 
Aim 3: Recommend a treatment paradigm for patients with COVID -related olfactory loss . 
 
 
 
 
 
Background  (Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   
 
Soon after the start of the COVID -19 pandemic, olfactory loss was identified as a common  presenting  symptom 
with anosmia reported in up to 75% of patients who tested positive for COVID -19 infection.1 The severity of 
alteration of the sense of smell or taste is mild to moderate in about two thirds  of patients with COVID -19 
infection2 and complete recovery is seen in 64% of patients  after symptom onset .3 In contrast, only 46% of 
patients with post -viral anosmia prior to the COVID -19 pandemic demonstrated clinically significant 
improvement in olfaction.4 The improved recovery rate seen in COVID -19 associated olfactory loss  may be 
explained by the selective sparing of the olfactory sensory neuron s, which lack the A CE2 receptor.5 
 
Olfactory training is the recommended treatment of post -viral olfactory dysfunction .6 Typical treatment 
includes exposure to four intense odors twice daily for twenty seconds each.7 Literature also supports  the use of 
twice daily budesonide rinses in the treatment of olfactory dysfunction, with significant improvement seen in 
patients treated with budesonide irrigations and olfactory training compared to olfactory training alone.8 
Evidence  supporting the use of systemic steroids is equivocal  with one randomized trial showing no statistically 
significant improvement  in odor detection threshold in patients with posttraumatic anosmia .9 Few studies have 
investigated the use of acupuncture in the treatment of post -viral olfactory dysfunction with one randomized

 trial demonstrating significant improvement in olfactory function compared to controls.10 Acupuncture is a low 
risk intervention when performed by trained professionals. The risk of a serious adverse event is rare and below 
that of many common medical interventions. The occurrence of serious adverse events following acupuncture 
treatment is ext remely rare when the acupuncture treatment is performed by a skilled and trained provider.  
Prospective studies of more than one million acupuncture treatments found that the risk of a serious adverse 
event is estimated to be 0.05 per 10,000 treatments and 0.55 per 10,000 individual patients.11 Acupuncture is 
generally safe for patients taking anticoagulant medications. A retrospective chart review found the occurrence 
rate of microbleeding (stopped within 30 s) was <4.8%.12 Additionally, a cupuncture during pregnancy appears 
to be associated with few AEs (adverse events) when correctly applied.13 
 
Limited data is available regarding the treatment of COVID -19 associated olfactory dysfunction . The standard 
of care for olfactory dysfunction at our institution is olfactory retraining and twice daily budesonide rinses.  The 
current study is designed to investigate the role of acupuncture in the treatment of post-viral olfactory 
dysfunction , specifically related to COVID -19 infection . By doing so, we hope to develop a treatment algorithm 
for COVID -19 related olfactory dys function that can be applied to clin ical practice.

 Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods :  Describe  in lay terms , completely detail ing the research activities that will be conducted by Mayo 
Clinic staff under this protocol . 
 
This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial and will include subjects who present to the ENT 
clinics previously diagnosed with post -viral olfactory dysfunction secondary to COVID -19 infection and add 
newly diagnosed subjects in the future.   All patients with post -viral olfactory dysfunction of at least 4 weeks 
and a positive COVID PCR will be eligible to participate in the study. This study has received approval by the  
COVID -19 Research Task Force. Interested patients can complete the COVID -19 research interest form posted 
on an externally -facing Mayo Clinic COVID -19 Research website and will be directed for enrollment by the 
COVID -19 Research Clearinghouse staff if eligible. The Mayo social media accounts will also include 
recruitment phras es such as “If you have loss of sense of smell and a history of COVID -19 infection, then 
consider seeing our Rhinology team for treatment options” and “If you have an appointment in the Mayo Clinic 
ENT department and have a history of COVID -19 infection, y our provider may ask you about loss of sense of 
smell and participation in a study looking at treatment options.”  
 
Phone, virtual, or in -person consents may be obtained by enrolling patients who are being seen by an ENT 
specialist at Mayo Clinic, or who previously saw a Mayo specialist who diagnosed them with olfactory loss 
from COVID -19 infection. For patients seen vi rtually, the following screening questions will be asked:  
• “Do you have purulent (colored or foul smelling) nasal or postnasal drainage?”  
• “Do you have worsening nasal obstruction over the past 6 months?”  
• “Do you use a steroid (budesonide or mometasone) nasal irrigation daily to treat chronic 
rhinosinusitis?”   
• “Have you been treated with an antibiotic for a sinus infection in the past 3 months?”  
If any of the above screening questions are positive, we would recommend an in -person appointment to rule out 
other causes of olfactory loss prior to treatment or enrollment in the study. If the patient does decide to be seen 
in person in the ENT departmen t and it is determined by their provider that their olfactory loss is due to 
COVID -19 infection, they would then be approached about enrolling in the study. This in -person appointment 
would be billed to the patient or his/her insurance, as normal.  Patient s who are seen via telemedicine with a 
negative screening will be offered enrollment in the study provided they are willing to travel to Mayo if selected 
into the treatment arm.  
 
Enrolled patients will be randomized into two groups at the time of accrual. The first group will undergo ten 
sessions of acupuncture therapy with a licensed acupuncturist, in addition to the twice daily budesonide 
irrigations and olfactory training.  Mayo Clinic compounding pharmacy formulates a powdered version of 
budesonide that comes in capsules. We will mail it to patients who are not seen in person along with 
instructions on how to perform the nasal irrigations in person or electronically. The cl inic n urse will also review 
the instructions with the patient during the in person or virtual visit. Acupuncture therapy will consist of two 
treatments per week for five weeks. Acupuncture points will include Du -20, Du -23, Li -20, Li -4, Lu -7, and St -36 
(see diagrams below of acupuncture points) . There is one point, Li -4, which is contraindicated for pregnant 
patients because it is known to induce labor. This point will be avoided in all pregnant women randomized to 
acupuncture but will be used in everyone else.  Needles will be left in place for 25 minutes per session. The 
second group will be treated only with twice daily budesonide rinses and olfactory training , which is considered

 the standard of care . Patients can opt out of the study at any point. UPSIT will be used to assess the sense of 
smell  at the initial visit and after three months of treatment. A clinically significant difference in UPSIT score is 
defined as a change in total score of 5 points.8 This is a scratch -and-sniff test where patients are given four 
multiple choice options to choose  the correct answer to each scented box. The initial test will be mailed to the 
participant if consent is obtained by telemedicine appointment. If consent is  obtained in person, the test may be 
delivered to the participant at the time of the appointment or mailed. The 3 -month test will be mailed to all 
participants unless they are returning for follow -up at that time.  If the UPSIT test is conducted remotely, we will 
provide verbal instructions during the initial telemedicine appointment on how to complete this. There are also 
instructions included in the test packet that is mailed to the patient instructing the patient  to scratch, sniff, and 
fill in the corresp onding multiple -choice bubble with the included pencil.  
 
Subjective measures of olfactory loss  and sense of smell  will also be obtained at the initial visit (virtual or in -
person) and at 3 months using the SNOT -22 questionnaire and  10-point visual analog scale with 0 representing 
no sense of smell and 10 representing normal smell. Both of these documents  may be mailed to patients. Results 
will be analyzed based on original treatment group. We will also perform subgroup analysis for age, gender, and 
duration of olfactory loss of 1 -4 months, 4 -8 months, 8 -12 months , and greater than 12 months.

Data Analysis  
 
 
Power analyses may not be appropriate if this is a feasibility or pilot study, but end -point analysis plans are 
always appropriate even if only exploratory. Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if 
not including all of the infor mation.  
 
Power Statement :   
This is novel work so estimates for change in UPSIT score for the 2 groups are unavailable. Therefore, no 
power/sample size calculation is possible.  
 
Data Analysis Plan:  
Differences in demographic/history/clinic factors between groups to be compared will be analyzed using chi -
square or fisher’s exact as appropriate for categorical factors and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous factors.  
 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to model differences in change in UPSIT score from baseline 
between the case and control group while accounting, where able, for any demographic/historical/clinical 
factors that are found to be significantly ass ociated with UPSIT score.  
 
Endpoints  
Primary: Post -treatment UPSIT scores  
Secondary : Patient -reported subjective olfactory loss

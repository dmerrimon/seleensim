1.1 Berg Protocol CTL0211 
Study Title: A multi- center,  Phase 1, dose- escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of a topical compound31543 ( Calcitriol , USP) in adult cancer patients 
receiving t axane -based chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced or recurrent 
disease. 
This w ill be a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the 
overall safety and tolerability of a topical compound 31543 (Calcitriol) in  patients with a 
diagnosis of early stage or locally advanced, unresectable and/or metastatic cancer, or patients with operable cancer, who are scheduled to receive follow up treatment with a taxane -based 
chemotherapy regimen (either pre-operatively or post-operatively), as per physician’s 
discretion .A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be employed with 3 -6 patients at each dose 
level. Eligible patients ≥18 years of age and scheduled to receive a taxane -based regimen with 
treatment breaks as per physician’s discretion, will start applying the topical solution twice a day 
at each cohort dose level two weeks or 7 days ±  2 days prior to initiation of chemotherapy and 
then continue twice daily for 3 months or until termination of chemotherapy treatment. If topical 
calcitriol is found to be effective in preventing and/or diminishing taxane chemotherapy-induced 
alopecia as determined by the photographic assessments and patient self -assessments, patients 
will be allowed to continue topical application for the duration of their chemotherapy treatment, assuming no dose l imiting t oxicities (DLTs) related to the topical agent or intolerable side effects  
are observed. Toxicity to the topical compound 31543 (c alcitriol)  will be assessed on a weekly 
basis during the first 28 days of topical treatment and subsequently every four weeks  by a study 
clinician, either a physician or a nurse. For the purpose of pharmacokinetic studies (PKs), blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of topical treatment at the following time points: pre -dose, at 
2 hrs (±30 minutes), 4 hr s (±30 minutes), and 8 hr s (±1 hr post dose) after a single application on 
the morning of Day 1. The second application of drug product will be applied 10-14 hr s after the 
initial application and after the 8 hr PK sample. Thereafter, topical application frequency will be 
twice daily, morning and night. Subsequently, a PK sample will be taken 12 hr s (±2 hr s) after the 
last dose of each 28-day treatment, before the first application of Day 1 of the next 28- day 
treatment cycle. This schedule will continue for three consecutive 28- day topical treatment 
cycles . (PKs will be drawn at Week s 1, 5, 9, and 13. In addition, if patients are still on study, a 
PK will also be drawn at Week  54.)  
As a secondary objective, potential efficacy of the topical calcitriol will be evaluated by photographic assessment. Photographic assessment will be performed using a Canon digital camera system to ensure standardization and uniformity among all enrolled patients. The following five views will be obtained at each photographic assessment: bilateral sides of head/scalp view, front of head/face view, back of head/scalp view, and top of head/scalp view .Additionally, close-up photographs will be taken at the same time points. They will include 
the mid -pattern of the scalp from a superior view and a vertex view with hair parted in the center 
and combed away from the center part. Photographs will be standardized for lighting, camera angle, and position to the participant’ s head.These  assessments will be performed at the 
following time points: at baseline, Week s 7, 15, 27, and 54. Photographs for patients in each 
cohort representing baseline, and treatment Week s 7 and 15 will be presented blind to the study 
PI and dermatologist, Mario Lacouture, after at least 3 patients have completed 15 weeks of treatment. Photographs will also be taken at Week  27 and Week  54 of the study but will be

Page 6 of 54 included in the final photographic assessment as secondary information. In addition, all patients 
will be asked to maintain an application log throughout treatment to  ensure compliance.  
Additionally patients will maintain a medication application diary and a self -assessment diary. 
The medication application diary will collect daily application details of the medication. This will include application dates and times, c hemotherapy cycle, and whether the medication was 
applied (or reason if the medication was not applied). The self- assessment diary will require  
assessment of hair thickness, hair fullness, hair breakage, and hair cosmetic qualities (ease of styling, etc.) on an analog 10 point scale to assess patient- reported efficacy. The PI clinical 
assessment of baseline, Week s 7 and  15 photographs will be used, together with the patient diary 
information, for the primary assessment of alopecia. The study is expected to take place over a period of approximately 12 months, including the screening period.

Page 8 of 54 3 BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
3.1 Chemotherapy -Induced Alopecia  
Chemotherapy -Induced Alopecia or CIA is a non- cicatricial alopecia and represents one of the 
most common and distressing dermatolo gical adverse events  associated with the use of many 
different chemotherapeutic agents. Taxanes (paclitaxel / docetaxel) , doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil can cause alopecia in >80%, 60%-100%, >60%, and 10%-
50% of patients, respectively.1 Among women undergoing therapy with paclitaxel monotherapy, 
alopecia can be observed in up to 82% of patients.2,3 CIA is believed to occur when hair follicles 
are in anagen phase and results in anagen effluvium due to toxicity of chemotherapy and its metabolites on the hair follicle.
1 CIA typically begins at 1 -3 weeks and is complete at 1 -2 months 
after the initiation of chemotherapy. This type of hair loss is usually reversible after the 
completion of therapy, with regrowth that occurs after a de lay of 3 -6 months. Nevertheless, the 
new hair often demonstrates changes in its color, structure, and texture with growth rate that may be significantly reduced.
1 This particular toxicity has signific ant psychosocial and quality-of- life 
consequences. It negatively affects patients’ perception of physical appearance, body image, sexuality, and self -esteem .
5-7 More importantly, among women, 58% consider it the most 
disturbing reaction and 8% are at risk of avoiding therapy due to this toxicity.8 Despite such 
profound effects on patients, to date no effective preventative or treatment options  are available. 
One approach, scalp -cooling, has been investigated since 1970s and has shown to diminish CIA. 
However, there is a lack of adequate clinical data with only 7 out of 53 conducted trials that were 
randomized, and further clinical and biochemical research is needed.9 Scalp cooling has been 
used to treat CIA.10 Topical minoxidil 2% topical solution has also been investigated in 
prevention of CIA and has been shown to diminish its duration but failed to prevent it.11 While 
multiple other ex perimental approaches are being investigated, no pharmacologic agent has been 
approved for prevention or treatment of CIA.1 
3.2 Calcitriol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 
Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis through its actions in the 
intestine, kidney, and parathyroid glands. These actions are mediated by the activated, hormonal form, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) .
12 Calcitriol is made by hydroxylation of calcidiol 
and represents t he active form of Vitamin D and is the most potent steroid hormone derived from 
cholecalciferol. In addition to these critical functions, calcitriol also plays a role at other sites, including control of cell proliferation, differentiation, the synthesis and secretion of cytokines and other hormones. Calcipotriol is a V itamin D analogue that has a similar activity in regard to 
Vitamin D receptor binding when compared with the active form of V itamin D3, calcitriol. It 
inhibits epidermal proliferation, modula tes keratinization and inflammation but is much less 
potent i n regulating calcium metabolism. Because  of these properties, numerous investigations 
have been conducted with Vitamin D and its analogs in their potential therapeutic application in cancer, immu ne modulation, and regulation of endocrine sys tem.
14 Interest in Vitamin D3 
derivatives for prevention of CIA has emerged based on the novel work by Joaquin Jimenez, MD at the University of Miami. A serendipitous experiment showed a topical solution of calcitriol to reduce alopecia that was attribu ted to its ability to arrest the cell cycle and reduce the sensitivity 
of the epithelium to chemotherapy. Unlike androgenetic alopecia, CIA occurs due to massive anagen effluvium attributed  to toxicity of chemotherapy and their metabolites on the hair follicle 
cells. The rapid cell proliferation in hair follicles during anagen renders hair follicles susceptible 
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9   02 November 2015

Page 9 of 54 to the toxicity of chemotherapy. Therefore, one approach to prevent CIA is to inhibit cell 
proliferation in order to diminish the sensitivity of hai r follicles to chemotherapy.  
3.3 Pre-clinical Studies  
3.3.1 Animal Studies  
Both CIA and alopecia areata ( AA) have been extensively studied due to the availability of 
animal  models which closely mimic the diseases in the human. In this regard, it was previously 
demonstrated that alopecic  chemotherapies (cytarabine,  cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, etoposide) induce alopecia in the neonatal rat model (Sprague Dawley rats). In this model, rats of 8 to 11 days of age are injected intraperitoneally with chemotherapy. Alopecia ensues 5 -7 days later, and is graded depending on the hair loss 
observed. The protective compounds are given on Day 5 after birth for 6 days. This model is 
useful to study CIA because the hair follicles at this stage are in 100% anagen, which renders them susceptible to chemotherapy toxicity and is comparable to the human setting.
17-19 This is a 
very effective and a reproducible model and can be used to study protective formulations against CIA. Some of the drawbacks of this model is that the hair follicles are in the first hair growth cycle after birth and that the rats have white fur an d lack pigmentation.
1 In contrast, the use of 
neonatal Long Evans rats allows studying pigmented hairs. Another model that is widely used to study the effect of chemotherapy is an adult C57BL/6 mouse model. The hair follicles in this model have gone through several postnatal growth cycles and the hair shafts are pigmented, similar to the human scalp .
1 The anagen cycle in this particular model is induced by depilation 
and is observed 8 to 9 days after the procedure. Using this model and cyclophosphamide, it has been demonstrated that as a response to cytotoxicity of chemotherapy, the hair follicle utilizes two pathways: dystrophic anagen or dystrophic catagen, which determines the onset of chemotherapy -induced alopecia and the pattern of hair re-growth.
1 A new model that has been 
used to investigate CIA is an adult Long Evans rat model, which allows studying hair follicles that have gone through several cycles and rats possess both pigmented and non-pigmented hairs. Additionally, the induction of anagen phase is performed by shaving fur with clippers, the method that may avoid the trauma to th e hair follicles that is induced by depilation. Another 
excellent model to study alopecia, more specifically, AA, has been the C3H/HeJ mouse model.
20 
In this model, 20% of the animals spontaneously develop alopecia in clusters or throughout the entire body (alopecia universalis) by 18 months of age. Alopecia patterns and histopathological analysis has shown that the pathology in this animal is almost identical to that of the human.  
1,25- Dihydroxyvitamin D3 protects by modulating the differentiation of hair follicle 
keratinocytes, rendering them resistant to the toxic metabolites  of chemotherapy. During the 
course of screening therapeutic compounds to treatAA , 1,25- Dihydroxyvitamin D3  was tested . 
The following study was conducted to characterize the effect of 1,25 -Dihydroxyvitamin D3 
indifferent types of alopecia, namely, CIA, Post- Chemotherapy Alopecia (PCA) andAA . The 
overall goal of this project was to determine if 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3could be used to treat 
alopecia in general.  
The results of pre- clinical studie s strongly suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts a protectiveeffect 
against chemotherapy -induced alopecia, but it does not treat alopecia itself. The rationale behind 
the preventive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 in CIA is that healthy hair follicles can be arrested and thereby rendered resistant to the chemotherapy. However, in hair follicles that are already apoptotic, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 does not offer any benefit.  
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9   02 November 2015  
 
Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 10 of 54 Findings in another animal study demonstrated a potential mechanism by which application of 
topic al calcitriol may diminish the incidence of CIA. Topical treatment with calcitriol was 
demonstrated to significantly diminish the degree of follicular apoptosis induced by cyclophosphamide in C57BL/6 mice.
21 Another experiment conducted with BALB/c mice, the 
animal model which allows investigating the hair follicles in the first adult anagen phase and evaluate gender differences, demonstrated that topical application of calcitriol for 5 days prior to intraper itoneal administration of cyclophosphamide significantly reduced the degree of CIA in a 
dose- dependent manner in male mice.
22 The protective effect of topical calcitriol was diminished 
in tumor- bearing male mice that were injected with EMT-6 murine breast tumor cells .22 In 
contrast, pre- treatment with topical calcitriol in tumor -bearing female mice injected with EMT -6 
murine breast tumor cells had a more efficient protective effect against cyclophosphamide induced alopecia as compared to female mice without tumor and their tumor- bearing male 
counterparts.
22 Histopathologic examination of post-mortem skin demonstrated marked reduction 
in morphological alterations induced by cyclophosphamide in hair follicles and a protective effect from cyclophosphamide -induced follicular damage.
22 However, in this model, no 
significant differences in apoptosis staining pattern were noted between mice treated with topical calcitriol and those without exposure to the solution. 
On the other hand, another animal study using the female C57BL/6 adolescent mice instead of a 
neonatal rat model, failed to demonstrate efficacy of topical calcitriol in prevention of 
cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia. Interestingly, however, the regrowth of pigmented hair shafts was significantly accelerated, enhanced, and quantitatively improved. Histopathologic investigations suggested that this may have been due to hair follicles favoring the “dystrophic catagen pathway” of response to chemical injury: fol licular repair strategy allowing for the 
unusually fast reconstruction of a new, undamaged anagen hair bulb.
23 
Multiple in vivo animal investigations failed to demonstrate the potential protective effect of calcitriol from cytotoxicity of chemotherapy on cancer cells. No statistically significant difference in the survival rate was seen between Sprague Dawley rats transplanted with chloroleukemia C51 cells pretreated with 0.2μg of 1,25(OH)2D3 and those pretreated with an ethanol vehicle prior to cyclophosphamide treatment .
16 More importantly, pretreatment with 
topical calcitriol of EMT -6 murine breast tumor- bearing male mice prior to intraperitoneal 
administration of cyclophosphamide resulted in the greater reduction in the rate of tumor growth as compared to mice treated with either agent alone, suggesting potential an ti-tumor effects of 
calcitriol. Similarly , pretreatment with 2.5 μg of calcitriol 3 doses daily for 3 days, followed by 
administration of varying doses of paclitaxel of squamous cell carcinoma and human prostate cell carcinoma bearing mice resulted in significant tumor regression.

The data suggests that the amount measured  in the reservoir solution is slightly greater  than the 
amount of endogenous c alcitriol that may be present (which is being released from the skin into 
the reservoir solution) and does not differentiate the topical formulations. However, no 
endogenous c alcitriol was measured in non-dosed chambers for the epidermis, dermis and 
surface wash samples, indicating that the amount that is measured in those compartments from the dosed skin sections is from the applied dose. This is further supported by the two formulations that contain 3 µg/mL c alcitriol versus those with 1 µg/mL concentration. The 
formulations showed a range of approximately 10-20% of drug penetration into the epidermis, based on the applied dose, but little to no penetration into the dermis (1% or less of applied dose). 
Prototype formulation CAR-03-031 containing API # 31543 (c alcitriol) in a vehicle of propylene 
glycol and d ehydrated alcohol, 200 proof in a 40/60 ratio (W/W) , has been identified as the 
prototype formulation for further development. 
3.4 Clinical S tudies  
One Phase 1 trial of topical topitriol ( calcitriol ) has been conducted. In this study, patients with 
stage II -IV breast cancer were scheduled to receive cyclophosphamide 500mg/m
2, doxorubicin 
50mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 500mg/m2 on Day  1 every 21 days. Topical c alcitriol  was applied to 
the scalp twice a day. The drug was applied by a nurse during the first 5 days of treatment and by 
the patient or a family member thereafter. The  cream was rubbed around the entire scalp and was 
maintaine d without washing for 8 hr s. Three different doses were evaluated: 500 μg per day for 7

Page 13 of 54 days prior to chemotherapy, 1000μg per day for 7 days prior to chemotherapy, and 2000μg per 
Day 5 days prior and post-chemotherapy. Treatment was continued until the appearance of grade 2 alopecia, as graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events NCI -CTCE. Patients’ serum and urine calcium excretion were monitored. 
Overall, there were 14 patients evaluated in this trial. All of th e patients  developed grade 2 
alopecia 20 -30 days after the first course of chemotherapy. Plasma and urinary calcium levels 
remained within normal limits during the study period. All patients treated with the first dose level, 4 out of 6 treated with 1000μg  per day, and 2 out of 4 patients treated with 2000μg per day 
developed mild pruritic maculopapular dermatitis on the scalp and surrounding skin exposed to topical topitriol.

One of the drawbacks of this pilot P hase 1 trial may be the inadequate dosing schedule, because 
topical application of the cream was only performed 1 week prior to chemotherapy administration. It is possible that the treatment duration was not sufficient to induce catagen stage in scalp hair follicles that subsequently made them more susceptible to cytotoxicity of chemotherapy. To compensate for this potential deficiency, in our trial topical c alcitriol will be 
applied starting 2 weeks prior to the initiation of chemotherapy in an attempt  to induce catagen 
stage that is anticipated to render protection agains t CIA. Patients unable or unwilling to wait the 
2 week pre- treatment period may elect to pre -treat for 7 days ±  2 days. Continued application on 
the daily basis will ensure the maintenance of catagen stage and extended  protection throughout 
administration of multiple doses of a taxane -containing regimen .  
Additionally, the previously conducted Phase 1 trial used a water -based formula that was 
originally intended for use in psoriasis. The drug delivery mechanisms are likely to vary significantly between the scalp epidermis and hyperproliferative psoriasis plaques, which may explain higher penetration and increased incidence of maculopapular dermatitis. Secondly, 
higher doses utilized in the previous Phase 1 trial may have been also responsible for the high incidence of contact dermatitis in the majority of treated patients. The formulation of topical compound31543 (c alcitriol ) that will be employed in this proposed trial is an anhydrous alcohol 
and glycol based formulation with penetration characteristics that favors epidermal exposure of the active ingredient.  
Another trial investigated the potential of a topical Vitamin D analogue, calcipotriol, in preventing chemotherapy- induced alopecia. Patients with breast cancer undergoing therapy with 
cyclophosphamide 600mg/m
2, methotrexate 40mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 600mg/m2 given on 
Days 1 and 8 in a 4- weekly  cycle were randomized to receive either topical calcipotriol scalp 
solution 50 μ g/mL or a vehicle. The solution was applied twice daily from 4 days prior to 
chemotherapy and continued for 14 days in each treatment cycle. However, there was no detectable effect of topical calcipotriol on the proportion of patients that experienced hair loss, hair shedding rates, and hair regrowth of hair density.
25 
The lack of interference of c alcitriol  with the efficacy of chemotherapy and the ability to 
potentiate its cytotoxic effects, previously demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo animal models, has also been d emonstrated by several clinical trials. This was demonstrated by a P hase 2 
randomized controlled trial of patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer who received weekly docetaxel with DN -101(high-dose c alcitriol, 45 μg) versus placebo. The  primary 
objective of this study was to evaluate the proportion of patients achieving PSA response ( ≥ 50% 
PSA reduction, confirmed  at least 4weeks later) in the two treatment arms. DN -101 (45μg) or 
placebo was administered orally on Day 1 followed by docet axel 36mg/m
2intravenously on Day2

Page 14 of 54 along with dexamethasone (4mgorally 12 hrs before, 1 hr before, and 12 hr s after docetaxel 
administration).This regimen was administered weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of a 4- week 
cycle. For each patient, the ﬁrst dose of docetaxel (Week  1, Cycle 1 only) was attenuated (27 
mg/m2) to collect additional safety data for the combination of DN-101 with docetaxel. Two 
hundred-ﬁfty patients were randomly assigned (125 patients in each arm). PSA decline 
(≥50%conﬁrmed 4weeks later) within 6 months of enrollment was reached in 49% of placebo 
treated patients and 58%of DN-101- treated patients (P=0.16). At anytime while on study, this 
end point was achieved in 52% of placebo treated patients and 63% of DN-101- treated patients 
(P=0.07). Measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 
Version 1.0)was present in 59 of placebo-treated patients (47%) and 48 of DN-101 treated 
patients (38%). Tumor response was seen in 14 (24%) and 14 (29%) of placebo and DN-101-treated patients, respectively (P=0.51). Overall survival showed a promising improvement in the DN-101 group over the placebogroup withaHRof 0.67 (95%CI, 0.45 to 0.97;P=0.04).The addition of calcitriol was associated with a reduction in the risk of death by approximately one third .
26 Overall, no increase in toxicity was seen with the addition of DN-101 to docetaxel. 
Toxici ties that might be expected with administration of supraphysiologic doses of c alcitriol  
were uncommon with weekly administration ofDN-101 except for mild  hypercalcemia. Six 
percent of placebo -treated patients and 7% of DN-101- treated patients had grade 1 to 2 creatinine 
elevation, 8% of placebo-treated patients and 33%of DN-101- treated patients had transient 
hypercalcemia. All the hypercalcemia episodes observed in theDN -101 arm were grade 1 and 
required no intervention, and did not result in dose reduction or delay in therapy. No patients on placebo and one patient on DN- 101 experienced symptomatic renal calcul i. Interestingly, the 
incidence of any grade 3 or 4 adverse events was 70% in placebo treated patients and 58% in DN-101 treated patients (P=0.065). Adverse effects leading to discontinuation of therapy were seen in 28% of placebo- treated patients and 22% of DN -101- treatedpatients. Serious adverse 
events, generally those requiring hospitalization, were observed in 41% of placebo- treated 
patients and 27% of DN-101- treated patients (P=0.023).
26 The incidence of docetaxel -induced 
alopecia was comparable between the two arms. The incidence of all -grade alopecia was 41% 
and 45% in the docetaxel plus placebo arm and DN-101 plus docetaxel arm, respectively.26 
In contrast, the follow-up randomized Phase 3 trial of high -dose c alcitriol in combination with 
weekly docetaxel as compared with placebo in combination with docetaxel administered every three weeks, showed that treatment with calcitriol was associated with significantly shorter 
survival.953 men with castration resistant prostate cancer were randomized to 45 µg DN-101, 36 mg/m
2docetaxel, and 24 mg dexamethasone weekly  (ASCENT arm , 477 patients ) for 3 out of 
every 4 weeks  or control arm (476 patients, 5 mg prednisone twice a day, and 75 
mg/m2docetaxel  and 24 mg dexamethasone every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was overall 
survival. At an interim analysis, more deaths were observed in the ASCENT arm, and the trial was halted early . Median overall survival was 16.8 months (95% CI, 15.8-19.3) for ASCENT 
subjects and 19.9 months (95% CI, 18.6- 22.7) for controls. In multivariate analysis adjusting for 
baseline variables, ASCENT was associated with shorter survival (HR=1.33; p=0.019). The proportions of patients with adverse events (AEs) were similar, and co nsistent with the known 
side effects of docetaxel. Dose modification for docetaxel  toxicity was more frequent in the 
ASCENT arm (229 ASCENT vs. 160 control subjects).The shorter survival in the ASCENT arm was potentially  attributed to inferior efficacy of weekly docetaxel administration as compared to 
docetaxel administered every three weeks .

Page 16 of 54 4 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION 
4.1 Design  
This is a multi-center, single arm, dose- escalation Phase 1 study. Eligible patients will begin 
applying the topical formulation of Compound 31543 to the scalp twice daily 2 weeks prior to 
the first dose of chemotherapy and continue the application twice daily until termination of chemotherapy treatment. Patients unable or unwilling to wait the 2 week pre- treatment period 
may elect to pre-treat for 7 days ± 2 days. Dose escalation will occur in stepwise increments of 
the immediate prior dose group, in the absence of grade 3 or greater toxicities attributed to the topical c alcitriol , in order to determine the MTD for this agent. Dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) will 
need to possibly, probably or definitely (defined in Section 8.4) be related to topical c alcitriol  
and not taxane- based re gimen as best determined by participating investigators. Similarly, 
appropriate dose modifications or treatment interruption of the chemotherapeutic regimen will be instituted according to the current standard of care. Determination of DLTs of the topical calcitriol  formulation will be made during the first 28 days of topical agent application. Subjects 
will be managed with adequate safety monitoring and pharmacokinetic ( PK) analysis in order to 
determine levels of exposure. PK analysis will be done before each new cohort moves forward. For the purpose of PK studies , blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of topical treatment at 
the following time points: pre -dose, at 2 hr s (± 30 minutes), 4 hr s (± 30 minutes), and 8 hr s (±1 
hr post- dose) after a single ap plication on the morning of Day 1. The second application of drug 
product will be applied 10-14 hr s after the initial application and after the 8 hr PK sample. 
Thereafter, topical application frequency will be twice daily, morning and night. Subsequently, a 
PK sample will be taken 12 hr s (±2 hr s) after the last dose of each 28-day treatment, before the 
first application of Day 1 of the next 28-day treatment cycle. This schedule will continue for three consecutive 28- day topical treatment cycles (PKs will be drawn at Week s 1, 5, 9, 13. In 
addition, if patients are still on study, a PK will also be drawn at Week  54). 
4.2 Intervention  
Patients with a diagnosis of early stage or locally advanced, unresectable and/or metastatic 
cancer, or patients with operable cancer, who are scheduled to receive follow up treatment with a taxane -based chemotherapy regimen (either pre -operatively or post- operatively), as per 
physician’s discretion  will be screened for eligibility to participate. All eligible patients will start 
applying 0.25mL of Compound 31543 (C alcitriol,  USP) to each of the four quadrants of the 
scalp( front right, front left, back right,  andback left ) with the metered pump spray unit twice a 
day 2 weeks prior to chemotherapy and subsequently continue twice- daily until termination of 
chemotherapy. Patients un able or unwilling to wait the 2 -week pre- treatment period may elect to 
pre-treat for 7 days ± 2 days. If topical calcitriol  is found to be effective in preventing and/or 
diminishing the taxane- based chemotherapy -induced alopecia, as determined by photographic 
assessments and patient self -report, patients will be allowed to continue twice -daily topical 
application for the duration of their chemotherapy treatment, assuming no DL Ts related to the 
topical agent are observed. Patients who elect to shave their hair prior to or during chemotherapy treatment will be excluded from the trial. The topical solution will be applied to the scalp. Hair and scalp should be dry or, if application is immediately after shampooing, the hair and scalp should be damp, not wet, to the touch by first towel drying the hair and scalp before application of the topical solution. The hair and scalp will not be washed or shampooed for at least 8 hr s 
after each application. Patients will be advised that that they may apply no more than two consecutive doses of Compound 31543 ( calcitriol  USP) before washing or shampooing.

Phase 1 Dosing Rationale: The NOAEL (no -‐observed -‐adverse -‐effect -‐level) in the non--
‐clinical animal studies was 10.31 µg/mL. To compare the animal and human doses of C31543, 
a margin of safety (MOS) was calculated using the NOAEL dose in the 4 -‐week minipig study 
and the initial dose in the Phase 1 clinical trial. In minipigs, the NOAEL, 10.31 µg/mL is 
equivalent to a dose of 3.33 µg/kg (10.31 µg/mL x 2.1 mL (dose volume) x 2X/day ÷ 13 kg 
[average weight of minipigs in Week 4]).  In humans, the starting dose was 5 µg/mL x 1 mL 2X/day ÷ 60kg=0.166). Based on these doses, the MOS was 20 which was an adequate margin over the initial clinical dose (5 µg/ml). The daily dose for 40 µ g/ml x 1mL BID is 1.33 µ g/kg, at 
60 µg/ml x 1ml BID the daily dose is 2.00 µ g/kg, and at 80 µg/ml x 1mL BID 2.67 µ g/kg, all 
below the calculated NOAEL of 3.33 µ g/kg.

Page 23 of 54 8 TREATMENT/INTERVENTI ON PLAN  
Eligible patients will be instructed to apply 0.25mL of topical calcitriol to each of the four 
quadrants of the scalp - front right, front left, back right, back left with the provided metered pump spray unit twice a day 2 weeks prior to the start of chemotherapy treatment. Patients 
unable or unwilling to wait the 2 -week pre- treatment period may elect to pre -treat for 7 days ± 2 
days. Subsequently , application will continue twice daily for three months or until termination of 
chemotherapy. The topical solution will be applied to the scalp. Hair and scalp should be dry or, if application is immediately after shampooing, the hair and scalp should be damp, not wet, to the touch by first towel drying the hair and scalp before application of the topical solution. The scalp will not be washed or shampooed for at least 8 hr s after each application. Patients will be 
advised that that they may apply no more than two consecutive of Compound 31543 (Calcitriol, USP) before washing or shampooing. Meaning, they must wash their hair after every other application of Compound 31543.Pati ents will self -administer the topical solution throughout the 
study; except for first dose, in which case application of topical calcitriol will be done by the 
study personnel. On  days when pharmacokinetic studies will be performed, patients will self -
admi nister the topical solution after the ph armacokinetics have been drawn.  
8.1 Taxane- Based Chemotherapy Administration  
All patients should be pre- medicated prior to administration of the chemotherapeutic agents  in 
order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactio ns, per institutional guidelines . The taxane 
regimen chosen is at the treating physician’s discretion and should be standard for the patient’s cancer type. The taxane regimen chosen should not change significantly while on study and receiving C31543 although dose reductions are allowed for toxicities related to chemotherapy. 
8.2 Dose Escalation 
Patients will be treated with the topical Compound 31543 (Calcitriol, USP) in cohorts of size 
three to six starting at dose level 1 (5  μg/mL). The dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity 
is declared acceptable (see below). Two dose levels were considered for escalation (10 and 20 μg/mL).  These dose levels were completed without DLT.  Amendment 8 will add additional 
dosing levels unt il MTD is achi eved (40, 60, 80, μg /mL.)Determination of dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT, defined in S ection 8.4) will be made during the first 28 days of topical treatment. No 
intra-patient dose escalation will be performed. DLT will need to possibly, probably or definitely 
(defined in Section 8.4) be related to topical calcitriol and not the chemotherapeutic regimen as 
best determined by participating investigators. The dose escalation scheme ( Table 3 ) will occur 
as follows: 
One 28-day cycle of treatment will be performed and evaluation of PK Data will occur before 
escalation to the next dose level.  
If none of the initial three patients in a cohort experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then a 
new cohort of three patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.  
If one of the three patients in a cohort experiences DLT, then up to three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. Escalation  will continue if a maximum of  one of the six 
patients experiences DLT.  
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9   02 November 2015  
 
Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 24 of 54 If two or more patients in a cohort experience DLT, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
will have been exceeded, and no further dose escalation will occur. The previous dose level will be considered as the MTD.  
If only three patients were treated at a dose level under consideration as the MTD, then up to 
three additional patients will be accrued to that dose level. If  no more than one of six patients at 
that dose level experience a DLT, then that dose level will be confirmed as the MTD.If  two or 
more patients in that cohort experience DLT, then the previous dose level will be studied in the same fashion.  
The MTD is defined as the dose level at which 0/3 or 1/6 subjects experiences DLT during the first 28-days treatment cycle below the dose at which 2/3 or 2/6 subjects experienced DLT. Thus, the MTD will have been exceeded when >30% (2/3 or 2/6) of subjects at any dose level develop DLT. If the MTD is not established after completing three cohorts of escalating doses, the study Sponsor will review the study findings with FDA Division of Dermatology to seek guidance as to amending the study protocol to add additional dose- escalating cohorts.  
The Cohort Revie w Committee ( CRC), comprised of the Berg medical monitor, Berg  CMO and 
SVP of Regulatory Affairs  or designee, and the principal investigator(s), will be fully aware of 
clinical and laboratory data, and must agree if dose escalation to the next cohort is appropriate. Pharmacokinetic data from each treatment cohort will also be reviewed by the CRC and considered in any decision to dose- escalate. Adverse event data from the treatment extension 
period will be presented, when available (at least monthly), to the CRC. These data will be considered for dose escalation decisions. In the event that MTD has not been reached after three cohorts have been treated, any further dose escalations will require a protocol amendment.  
The CRC will review all available data fro m previous cohorts to assure that the actual dose 
escalation determined in this fashion does not expose subjects to unreasonable risk. The CRC 
may reduce or halt dose escalations for any reason ( eg, observation of non-linear PK, AEs in 
subjects who receive more than one dose of C31543 Topical Solution). The decision to proceed with the next cohort will require unanimous agreement of the members of the CRC. 
The nonclinical toxicology has been reviewed and the C ohort 1 drug concentration established 
by Berg , LLC and the FDA is approximately 1/20 or less of the expected MTD based on the 
nonclinical studies. As there is no presupposed risk of dose limiting toxicities at the C ohort 1 
dosing detailed in the Phase 1 protocol, it has been determined that there will be no minus 1 
dosing cohort. If two or more of the initial patients experience unacceptable toxicities at the initial Calcitriol  dose, the CRC will review all available data and may elect to discontinue the 
study.

Number of Subjects per C ohort with DLT 
during Treatment Period  Dose Escalation Decision Rule 
0 out of 3 Enter 3 subjects at the next dose level  
1 out of 3 Enter at least 3 more subjects at this dose level.  
If none of the 3 additional subjects has DLT, proceed to the next 
dose level. 
If 1 or more of the 3 additional subjects has DLT, then dose 
escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared the maximum 
administered dose (MAD). Three additional subjects will be entered at the next lowest dose le vel if only 3 subjects were 
treated previously at that dose.  
2 out of 6 Dose escalation will be stopped. This dose level will be declared 
the MAD (highest dose administered). Three additional subjects 
will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 subjects were treated previously at that dose.  
1 out of 6 at highest dose level below the maximally administered dose This is generally the recommended P hase 2 dose.  
 
8.3 Pharmacokinetics ( All Patients)  
For the purpose of pharmacokinetic (PK) studies , blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of 
topical treatment at the following time points: pre -dose, at 2 hrs (± 30 minutes), 4 hrs (± 30 
minutes) , and 8 hrs (± 1 hr post dose) after a single application  on the morning of Day 1. The 
second application of drug product will be applied 10-14 hr s after the initial application and after 
the 8 hr PK sample. Thereafter, topical application frequency will be twice daily, morning and 
night. Subsequently, a PK sample will be taken 12 hrs (±2 hr s) after the last dose of each 28-day 
treatment, before the first application of Day 1 of the next 28-day treatment cycle. This schedule will continue for three consecutive 28-day topical treatment cycles. (PKs will be drawn at Week s 
1, 5, 9, 13. In addition if patients are still on study, a PK will also be drawn at Week  54.) Vital 
signs will be obtained approximately 5 minutes before each blood collection, and the actual collection times will be recorded.  
At each collection , collect blood by venipuncture in a serum separator  tube(s). Centrifuge at 
1200 RCF for 10 ± 5 minutes, and aliquot 1.5 mL of serum each into 2 labeled externally threaded cryogenic vials and  immediately freeze. Ship frozen samples to Berg Diagnostics.  
Samples  collected from each cohort will be shipped frozen on dry ice to Berg Diagnostics  for 
analytical determination of C31543 concentrations in serum . Serum  samples will be transported 
with a sufficient amount of dry ice to keep the samples frozen for at least 2 days, and should not be shipped to arrive over weekends or holidays. World Courier will provide all shipping materials . Please contact World Courier 3 days in advance for pre- filled waybills and to schedule 
pick-up.

Attention: Sample Accessioning  
The serum  PK of C31543 will be calculated from serum  collected from all subjects who receive 
C31543.The following serum  PK parameters will be calculated using non- compartmental 
analysis:  
• UC 0-t:  Area under the concentration — time curve up to the last measurable 
concentration  calculated by the trapezoidal rule and expressed in units of concentration 
— time  
• AUC 0-inf: Area under the serum  concentrat ion-time curve from time of dosing to infinity 
calculated by dividing the last quantifiable concentration by Kel and adding the result to 
AUC0 -t, expressed in units of concentration- time. 
• Cmax:  The observed peak drug concentration obtained directly from t he experimental  data 
without interpolation, expressed in concentration units 
• Tmax:  The observed time to reach peak drug concentration obtained directly from  the 
experimental data without interpolation, expressed in time units ( hr) 
• Kel:  The apparent elimi nation rate constant, determined by regression analysis of the 
log-linear segment of the serum  concentration- time curve, expressed in time -1 units 
(1/hr) 
• t1/2:  The terminal half -life, calculated as - ln 2/Kel, expressed in time units( hr) 
• CL:  Clearance calculated as the drug dose/AUC0 -inf, expressed in units offlow  (L/hr) 
• Vd:  Volume of distribution calculated as CL divided by Kel and expressed in  units of 
volume (L) 
Descriptive statistics (including number, mean, median, standard deviation, and range) for PK 
parameters will be tabulated by dose level. Estimated renal elimination will be tabulated by dose level.  
8.4 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Treatment Modifications 
Toxicities will be graded according to the Common Terminology Cr iteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE  v4.0). 
8.4.1 Dose -Limiting Toxicity Related to Calcitriol  
Dose -limiting toxicity is defined as a clinically significant grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity 
occurring during the first 28- day treatment cycle of the topical agent application, and needs to be 
possibly, probably, definitely related to calcitriol (and not the chemotherapeutic regimen) as best determined by investigators.  
Excessive  dosage of calcitriol induces hypercalcemia and in some instances h ypercalciuria. If the 
patient presents with symptoms of hypercalcemia, serum calcium should be determined and 
treatment should be stopped immediately. Hypercalcemia defined using CTCAE version 4.0 
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9   02 November 2015  
 
Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 27 of 54 grade 3 is serum calcium > 12.5-13.5 mg/dL; >  3.1-3.4 mmol/L or Ionized calcium > 1.6-1.8 
mmol/L, hospitalization is indicated.  
For patients with hypercalcemia determined by elevated serum calcium, if the ionized calcium 
level is in fact elevated, the study drug will be stopped and the patient removed from the study. If the ionized calcium level is normal, the patient will remain on the study and ionized calcium will be followed rather than serum calcium.  If the patient is removed from the study for this reason, 
serum calcium and phosphate levels will be checked with daily blood draws at the testing center until they are normal for two consecutive days.  
8.4.2 Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
If patients develop toxicities related to their chemotherapeutic regimen, the dose reductions will 
be followed per institutional guidelines. During modifications in the chemotherapeutic regimen, 
calcitriol doses will remain  stable unless modifications are deemed necessary by the investigator.

Page 28 of 54 9 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
9.1 Clinical  
History and physical examination will be performed as detailed in the table below. Following the 
start of application of topical calcitriol 2 weeks or 7 ± 2 days prior to initiation of chemotherapy, 
patients will be seen by an investigator for interim medical history, concomitant medication, physical exam including weight, vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, respiration rate, heart rate), and adverse events at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 27, and 54.  
9.2 Laboratory 
Laboratory evaluation will be performed as described in Table 4 and Table 5below.  
9.3 Dermatology Evaluation. 
The subjects wi ll be seen by a dermatologist during W eeks 2 and 7 as detailed in the tables 
below ( Table 5  and Table 6 ). This review will include the following:  
• A visual inspection of the scalp ( oiliness/ dryness, erythema, inflammation, scaling, 
papules, pustules, erosions, pustules, excoriations, rash; including perifollicular changes)  
• Palpation of the sc alp 
• Examination of hair (quantity/ length, density, color, texture, hair pull test, hair shaft, 
morphology, distribution) including eyelashes/eyebrows  
• Interval dermatologic history: issues with use of agent (skin, hair etc.)  
Any abnormalities will be docum ented in the medical record along with any problems reported 
by the patient with use of calcitriol  (itchiness, stinging, irritation, burning, hair loss). All 
abnormalities and problems will be reviewed by the investigator to determine if they meet the 
criteria for adverse events.  
9.4 Photographic Record  of Hair and S calp 
Alopecia is defined as any hair loss. In this study centralized photographic review by a single 
dermatologist will be conducted using the Canfield Clinical Photography assessment images that 
will be acquired by the research staff to ensure standardization and uniformity among all enrolled 
patients. Please refer to the Canfield User Manual and Quick Reference Guide  for instructions 
detailing the use of the Canfield equipment provided to photographically record the hair and scalp. These documents outline how to prepare the subjects, complete and use the ID card and ID card holders, photograph and upload the photos onto the Canfield portal.  
The following five views will be obtained at each photographic assessment: bilateral sides of 
head/scalp view, front of head/face view, back of head/scalp view, and top of head/scalp view. Additionally, close-up photographs will be taken at the same times points. They will include the mid-pattern of the scalp from a superior view and a vertex view with hair parted in the center and 
combed away from the center part. Photographs will be standardized for lighting, camera angle, and position to the participants head. 
Centralized  photographic review will be conducted by one dermatologist reviewer and 
photographs will be evaluated using a 7-point evaluation scale for hair volume (Table 9 -1).The 
reviewer will compare the photographs acquired at baseline, Week 7 and Week 15. Comparisons 
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9   02 November 2015  
 
Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 29 of 54 may be made to Week 27 and Week 54, if applicable. The dermatologist reviewer scoring the 
photographs will be blinded to time sequence of the photographs aside from the baseline photographs to which all others will be compared.

2 Moderately increased  50-75% hair gain  
3 Greatly increased  > 75% hair gain  
 
9.5 Subjective R ecord of Hair and S calp 
Alopecia will also be subjectively recorded through the patient self-reported diaries.  All patients 
are asked to complete  this self -assessment diary  weekly  that will require assessment of hair 
thickness, hair fullness, hair breakage, and hair cosmetic qualities (ease of styling, etc.) on an 
analog 10 point scale throughout treatment to assess patient-reported efficacy of the study drug. These will be complet ed weekly and returned to the research staff at every visit during C31543 
treatment. The study is expected to take place over a period of approximately 12 months, 
including the screening period.

Page 39 of 54 13 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL  FROM STUDY  
All patients may continue therapy unless DLT  is documented. In case of death, the cause of 
death should be documented.  
The following events may be considered sufficient reason for discont inuing treatment with the 
study medication:  
• Serious toxicity due to the study drug graded according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 
• Conditions requiring therapeutic intervention not permitted by the protocol 
• Unacceptable toxicity in the opinion of the patient or investigator even if not specifically defined elsewhere  
• Personal preference by the patient for any reason  
• Subject non- compliance with the defined treatment plan  
• Medical or psychiatric illness Any other situation wh ere, in the opinion of the 
investigator, continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the patient or further therapy is not possible  
• Pregnancy  
• Loss of all of the patient’s hair after the first three cycles of topical calcitriol application  
Subjects may withdraw their consent to participate in the study at any time without prejudice. 
The investigator may withdraw a subject if, in his or her clinical judgment, it is in the best interest of the subject or if the subject cannot comply with the protocol. When possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit should be carried out. Berg should be notified of all subject withdrawals as soon as possible. 
If a subject fails to return for the protocol defined visits, an effort must be made to determine the 
reason. If the subject cannot be reached by telephone, a registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the subject (or the subject’s legal guardian) requesting contact with the clinic. This 
information should be recorded in the CRF. 
The investigator will also withdraw a subject upon Berg ’s request or if Berg  chooses to terminate 
the study. Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable adverse effect , the principal investigator 
will confer with the Berg  representati ve. If a subject is discontinued due to an adverse effect , the 
event will be followed until it is resolved, or if not resolved within a reasonable time 
(approximately 30 days), until its clinical relevance and etiology can be reasonably explained. A subject may withdraw his or her consent at any time during the study. 
If a subject withdraws from the study at any time either at his or her request or at the principal 
investigator’s discretion, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the CRF. All subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely will undergo all end -of-study assessments, if possible.  
Every effort must be made to undertake protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures.

Page 40 of 54 14 BIOSTATISTICS  
This is a Phase 1 study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of C31543 
topical calcitriol in patients with CIA. Three doses of topical calcitriol ( 5 μg/mL, 10 μ g/mL, and 
20 μg/mL) have been tested to date without DLT.  Amendment 8 adds additional dosing levels 
(40 μg /mL, 60 μg /mL 80 μg /mL)until MTD is achieved.   
Patients will be treated in cohorts of size three to six and the dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity is acceptable. A patient is considered toxicity -free for the purpose of the trial if 
s/he completes the first month  of topical agent application without experiencing dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT). If the topical agent is discontinued during the first month for reasons other than toxicity, an additional patient may be enrolled at that dose level to ensure adequate evalua tion of 
toxicity. No intra -patient dose escalation will be performed. In all cases, including those when 
the topical treatment continues post 4 weeks, the MTD assessment will be based only on the DLT recorded during the first  month. DLT is defined in Section 8.4and the design is constructed 
to minimize the chances of escalating the dose when the probability of DLT is high, and maximize the chance of escalating the dose when the probability of DLT is low. The dose escalation scheme is as follows:  
1. If none of the initial three patients at a given dose level experience DLT, the next dose level will be studied.  
2. If one of the initial three patients at a given dose level experiences DLT, three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. Escalation will continue only if there has been no additional DLT observed. 
3. If two or more patients experience DLT at a given dose, the previous dose will be declared the  MTD.  
4. If only three patients were treated at a dose under consideration as MTD, an additional three patients will be treated at that level to confirm previous results.  
The probability that dose escalation will occur at any stage during MTD determination, is a 
function of the underlying DLT rate at the current dose level. This probability can be calculated as the sum of the binomial probabilities of the following two outcomes that would permit escalation to occur:  
1. No DLT observed in the first three patients.  
2. One DLT is observed in the first three patients followed by no DLT observed in three additional patients at the same dose level.  
The true risk of toxicity is expected to be in the range of 10%-50%.The following table shows the corresponding proba bilities of dose escalation:  
True Risk of Toxicity 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 
Probability of Escalation  0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 
 
These numbers show the probability of escalating to the next dose level is large when the 
underlying true toxicity rate is small and the probability of escalating decreases appropriately as the true toxicity rate increases.

14.1 Safety Analyses 
Selected non -hematologic and hematologic toxicities, as measured by the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 4.0), will be described by frequency and 
grade, by cycle and over all cycles, with the maximum grade over all cycles used as the summary 
measure per patient.  
Adverse event terms recorded on the CRF will be mapped to preferred terms using the medical dictionary for regulatory activ ities (MedDRA) dictionary. All adverse events (AEs) will be listed 
or tabulated for overall incidence and for incidence for each dose cohort, worst reported severity, and relationship to study treatment according to system organ class and preferred term. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be similarly summarized. Listings of deaths, SAEs, DLTs, and AEs leading to early termination of study treatment, or premature withdrawal from trial will also be provided. 
Laboratory variables will be examined using mean change in value from baseline to various time 
points for each dose cohort. Laboratory values will also be categorized according to the CTCAE v4.0; listings or tables will be categorized by the worst on -study toxicity grade, dose cohort, and 
relationship. Shift tables will be presented to show the number and percent of subjects with high, normal, and low (or normal/abnormal) laboratory results at baseline and last assessment. 
Concomitant medications will be summarized for all subjects, inclu ding summary by dose 
cohort. 
14.2 Significance Level  
Centralized  Photographic review by a dermatologist and patient self -reported diaries will be used 
for preliminary statistical analyses. Analyses will look at the efficacy of Topical Compound 
C31543. This will be helpful for further studies looking more closely at the efficacy of C31543. 
While no formal statistical testing is planned for this study, 95% confidence intervals may be 
calculated for selected safety variables. This Phase 1 trial will accrue only thr ee patients per 
cohort, which is not a statistically significant number of patients, nor is the trial design adequate 
to provide objective statistical data sufficient for proof of efficacy.  
14.3 Exploratory Analyses 
Exploratory variables will be assessed for ea ch subject, and descriptive statistics (including 
number, mean, median, standard deviation, and range) will be calculated for subjects by dose level . 
14.4 Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis is planned. 
14.5 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
The P hase 1 portion of the study for 3- 6 patients to be treated at each dose level.  The original 
assumption was that 3 dose levels would be required resulting in a minimum of 2 and a 
maximum of 18 patients enrolled.  Amendment 8 adds 3 additional dose levels resulting in a maximum of 18 additional patients enrolled.  With 12 patients enrolled and treated to date, the maximum number of patients enrolled in the study would be 30.  This clinical trial will be

Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 42 of 54 conducted at two clinical site s. With  the expected accrual rate of approximately 3 -6 eligible 
patients per treatment cohort, it was  expected that the Phase 1 portion of the trial would take less 
than 1 year. This would allow each 3 -patient cohort to be observed for 28 days, the length of 
time for treatment with one c ycle of therapy prior to additional patients being accrued .  It is 
anticipated that the enrollment of the 3 additional dosing levels will take less than 1 year.

Page 44 of 54 16 ADVERSE EVENT S 
16.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product that may or may not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. Pre-existing conditions that worsen during a study will be reported as AEs.  
All AEs that occur after the informed consent is obtained will be reported on the AE page of the CRF . 
16.2 Relationship Between the Adverse Even t and the Study Drug  
The investigator must also assess the relationship of any adverse event to the use of study drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines: 
1. Not related  
a. The AE is not related if exposure to the investigational product has not occurred, or 
b. The AE is associated with an alternate cause.  
2. Unlikely Related  
a. The occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time, or  
b. The AE is considered unlikely to be related to use of the investigational product ( ie, there are no facts or arguments to suggest an alternate 
relationship). 
3. Possibly Related 
a. The investigational product administration and the AE are considered reasonably related in time, and  
b. There are facts to suggest a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. 
4. Probably Related 
a. The investigational product administration and the AE are reasonably related in time, and  
b. The AE is more likely explained by exposure to the investigational product than by other factors or causes, or i s the most likely cause of the AE.  
5. Definitely related  
16.3 Treatment and Follow- Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be monitored until resolution or, if the AE is determined to be chronic, a cause is 
identified. If an AE is considered potentially related to study treatment and remains unresolved at 
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9     02 November 2015  
Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 45 of 54 the conclusion of the study, the event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or initiation 
of treatment that confounds the ability to assess the event . 
16.4 Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
Laboratory test results  will be recorded on the laboratory results pages of the Case Report Form 
(CRF), or appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the central 
laboratory, if applicable. Laboratory test value abnormalities as such should not b e reported on the 
AE page of the CRF as AEs unless they result in a clinically relevant condition.  
16.4.1 Follow-Up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values 
In the event of unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be repeated immediately and follow ed up until they have returned to the normal range or an adequate 
explanation of the abnormality is found. If a clear explanation is established, it should be recorded on the CRF. 
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9     02 November 2015  
Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 46 of 54 17 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
Any clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious and that occurs during the 
course of the study, irrespective of the treatment received by the subject, must be reported to Berg  (or designee) within 24 hr s of awareness of the event(expedited reporting). 
The definition and reporting requirements of the International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A will be adhered to. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life threatening ( ie, in the opinion of the investigator, the AE places the subject at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death). 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is an important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment , may 
jeopardize the subject or may not be immediately life -threatening, or result in death or 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above ( eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic  bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse). 
17.1 SAE Rep orting  
Any SAE, whether or not considered to be related to treatment with topical calcitriol will be reported within 24 hrs from  awareness of the event to Berg  (or designee) and will be recorded on 
both the SAE initial report form and the CRF. The outcome of the SAE, and medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page. Forms for reporting SAEs and SAE Report Completion Guidelines will be provided to the study sites.  
All SAEs that occur after the  first dose of topical calcitriol and through study termination, will 
be reported in accordance with US regulations governing safety reporting (21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and 312.33). 
Reporting of SAEs by the investigator to his or her internal review board (IRB) will be done in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB. Adequate documentation must be maintained showing that the IRB was properly notified. 
For notification of an SAE, the following individual m ust be contacted:  
Berg  medical monitor: Brian  Berman , MD, PhD

Page 47 of 54 17.2 Berg SAE Reporting Requirements  
Berg must inform investigators and regulatory authorities of reportable events in compliance 
with applicable regulatory requirements on an expedited basis (ie, within specific timeframes). For this reason, it is imperative that investigational sites provide complete SAE information in the manner described above.  
Berg is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the competent authority, other applicable 
regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.32), and/or local regulatory requirements. Investigators are responsible for reporting to their IRBs per local requirements.

Page 48 of 54 18 ETHICAL, FINANCIAL, AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
18.1 Informed Consent Procedures  
Before protoc ol-specified procedures are carried out, consenting professionals will explain full 
details of the protocol and study procedures as well as the risks involved to participants prior to 
their inclusion in the study. Participants will also be informed that th ey are free to withdraw from 
the study at any time. All participants must sign an IRB -approved consent form indicating their 
consent to participate. This consent form meets the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations and the Institutional Review Board. The consent form will include the following:  
• The nature and objectives, potential risks and benefits of the intended study.  
• The length of study and the likely follow-up required. 
• Alternatives to the proposed study. (This will include available stand ard and 
investigational therapies. In addition, patients will be offered an option of supportive care for therapeutic studies.) 
• The name of the investigator(s) responsible for the protocol. 
• The right of the participant to accept or refuse study interventions/interactions and to 
withdraw from participation at any time.  
Before any protocol -specific procedures can be carried out, the consenting professional will fully 
explain the aspects of patient privacy concerning research specific information.  
Each participant and consenting professional will sign the consent form. The participant must 
receive a copy of the signed informed consent form. 
18.2 IRB Approval 
The trial protocol, ICF, IB, available safety information, patient documents (eg, trial diaries), 
patient re cruitment procedures (eg, advertisements), information about payments (ie, PI 
payments) and compensation available to the patients and documentation evidencing the PI‘s qualifications should be submitted to the IRB for ethical review and approval prior to the trial start.  
18.3 Confidentiality  
18.3.1 Patient Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of the patient‘s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) and national data protection laws, as appl icable. HIPPA regulations require that, in order to participate in the trial, a patient must 
sign an authorization from the trial that he or she has been informed of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in  this trial;  
• Who will have access to that information and why;  
• Who will use or disclose that information;  
• That health information may be further disclosed by the recipients of the information, and 
that if the information is disclosed the information may  no longer be protected by federal 
or state privacy laws;  
Protocol CTL0211   Amendment 9     02 November 2015  
Confidential Property of Berg, LLC  
Page 49 of 54 • The information collected about the research trial will be kept separate from the patient‘s 
medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after the 
conclusion of the t rial;  
• Whether the authorization contains an expiration date; and  
• The rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization.  
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, by regulation, re tains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization. For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (ie, that the patient is alive) at the end of their scheduled trial period.  
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and applicable parts of 21 CFR it is a requirement that 
the investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of Berg, the regulatory authorities, and the IRB direct access to review the patient‘s original  medical records at the site 
for verification of trial -related procedures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: 
• Only a unique trial number and initials will identify patients on the CRF or other documents submitted to Berg.  
• This information, together with the patient‘s date of birth, will be used in the database for 
patient identification.  
•  Patient‘s name and address will not be entered in the CRF or database.  
•  No material bearing a patient‘s name will be kept on file by Berg.  
• Patients  will be informed of their rights within the ICF.  
18.3.2 Investigator and Staff Information 
Personal data of the investigators and sub-investigators may be included in the Berg database, 
and shall be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  When archiving or 
processing personal data pertaining to the investigator or sub- investigator, Berg shall take all 
appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by any unauthorized party.

Page 50 of 54 19 RECORD RETENTION AND DOCUMENTATION OF THE  TRIAL 
19.1 Amendments to Protocol  
Amendments to the protocol shall be planned, documented and signature authorized prior to 
implementation.  
If an amendment to the protocol is required, the amendment will be originated and documented by Berg. The  written amendment must be reviewed and approved by Berg , and submitted to the 
IRB at the investigator’s facility for the Board’s approval. 
It should be further noted that, if an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the trial 
design or the potential risks to the patients, their consent to continue participation in the trial should be obtained. 
19.2 Trial Documentation and Storage 
Source documents are the original documents, data, records and certified copies of original 
records of clinical findings, observations and ac tivities from which the patient‘s CRF data are 
obtained. The PI and research staff is responsible for maintaining trial- related (essential) 
documentation, suitable for inspection at any time by representatives from Berg and/or applicable regulatory authorities. This should contain at a minimum all relevant documents and correspondence as outlined in ICH GCP Section 8 and 21 CFR Part 312.57. In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRF must be maintained and be readily available.  
The Investigator shall maintain adequate records of drug disposition, case histories and any other trial-related records as per 21 CFR Part 312.62 for no less than 2 years after the last marketing application has been approved by FDA; or, in the event that the marketing application has not been approved by FDA, for no less than 2 years after the last shipment/delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation. 
If the investigator relocates, retires,  or for any reason withdraws from the trial, both Berg and its 
representative should be prospectively notified. The trial records must be transferred to an 
acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or Berg. The investigator must obtain the Sponsor‘s written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention 
requirements have been met. All trial files will be maintained by Berg or its representative throughout the trial, and will be transferred to Berg at the conclusion of the trial. 
19.3 Data Collection 
The trial e CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the trial. eCRFs will be completed 
using the English language and should be kept current to enable the monitor to review the 
patient‘s status throughout the cours e of the trial.  
All data requested on the eCRF must be supported by and be consistent with the patient‘s source documentation. All missing data must be explained. For any entry errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided. The investigator will electronically sign and date the patient eCRF casebook indicating that the data in the e CRF 
has been assessed.

The investigator will permit trial-related monitoring, quality audits, and inspections of all trial-
related documents (eg, source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, case report forms) by Berg or its representative(s) and government regulatory authorities. The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable trial -related facilities. The 
investigator will ensure that the trial monitor or any other compliance or QA reviewer is given access to all trial -related d ocuments and trial- related facilities.  
Independent monitoring of the clinical study for protocol and GCP compliance will be conducted 
periodically by qualified staff chosen  by Berg to  ensure the human subject protection, trial 
procedures, laboratory, trial intervention administration, and data collection processes are of high 
quality and meet Sponsor, GCP/ICH and, when appropriate, regulatory guidelines. The  Site 
Monitoring Plan will outline the details of the monitoring process.  
19.5 Disclosure and Publication Policy  
All information provided regarding the trial, as well as all information collected/documented during the course of the trial, will be regarded as confidential. Berg reserves the right to release literature publications based on the results of the trial. Re sults from the trial will be 
published/presented as per Berg’s publication strategy.  
Berg will register the trial on 
www.clinicaltrials.gov . In addition, Berg will publish the results of 
the trial.  
Inclusion of the investigator in the authorship of any multicenter publication will be based upon 
substantial contribution to the design, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting and/or critically revising any manuscript(s) derived from the trial. The investigator ac knowledges that the trial is 
part of a multicenter trial and agrees that any publication by the investigator of the results of the 
trial conducted at the research site shall not be made before the first multicenter publication. In the event there is no mul ticenter publication within fifteen (15) months after the trial has been 
completed or terminated at all trial sites, and all data has been received, the investigator shall have the right to publish its results from the trial, subject to the notice requirements described herein and subject to acknowledgement of Berg as appropriate. Investigator shall provide Berg thirty (30) days to review a manuscript or any poster presentation, abstract or other written or oral material which describes the results of the trial for the purpose only of determining if any confidential or patentable information is disclosed thereby. If Berg requests in writing, the investigator shall withhold any publication or presentation an additional sixty (60) days solely to permit Berg to  seek patent protection and to remove any Berg Confidential Information from all 
publications.

This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the applicable U nited States  government regulations and Mayo Clinic research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) are well known to cause kidney damage. The most common 
example is light chain deposition disease that occurs commonly in the setting of multiple myeloma.
1 Over the last several years, however, there is more recognition that many kidney lesions 
are associated with low -grade plasma cell dyscrasia or  lymphoproliferative disorders.2 In fact the 
term monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) has been introduced to capture kidney lesions associated with monoclonal gammopathy (MG) in the absence of multiple myelom a.
3 One of the lesions commonly encountered in patients with MGRS is proliferative 
glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition (PGNMID) were damage is caused by direct deposition of the monoclonals with associated inflammation.
4-6 Another is C3 
glomerulopathy (C3 GN) in the setting of MG where the monoclonals result in activation of 
complement pathway and indirectly result in renal injur y.7-9 PGNMID and C3 GN associated with 
MG are diagnosed based on renal biopsy. Majority of patients present with hematuria and proteinuria and many have a progressive course with loss of renal function over time. Up to 70% of patients with PGNMID may have negative serum electrophoresis with immunofixation, normal serum free light chains and no clone may be identified on bone marrow biopsy.
6 Treatment of 
patients with PGNMID and C3GN associated with MG should be directed towards the pathologic clone.  There is currently no standardized treatment for these patients and treatments va ry based 
on clinical practice. We currently use combination of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with IgG and IgA monoclonals, and rituximab in patients with IgM monoclonals.
10 The current treatments however, have h ad limited success rate and are associated 
with significant side effects. There is a desperate need for additional therapeutic options in this population. The high expression of CD38 on plasma cells and low expression on other myeloid cells makes CD38 an appealing target for monoclonal antibody therapy such as daratumumab. Daratumumab has been efficacious in treatment of patients with refractory multiple myeloma and overall is well- tolerated. 
11 We propose use of daratumumab as first or second line agent in patients 
with PGNMID and C3GN associated with MG.  
1.2 Investigational Agent 
Daratumumab is an IgG1 -kappa human monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD38 
transmembrane glycoprotein on the surface of tumor cells and induces apoptosis. This process is 
mediated through Fc mediated cross linking and immune- mediated cell lysis through 
complement dependent cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis . It has an elimination half -time of 18 days and volume of 
distribution of 4.7L. Daratumumab is FDA approved for use in treatment of multiple myeloma, however is not approved for treatment of  the condition under study, PGNMID and C3 GN 
associated with MG .  The study was submitted by the Principal Investigator to the FDA for 
review and granted an IND Exemption.

 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 8 of 40 1.3 Clinical Data to Date 
The safety and efficacy of daratumumab in patients with refractory multiple myeloma has been 
shown in two open- label studies.  The first was a phase 1 -2 study published in NEJM which 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab in 42 patients. Overall 36% of patients had complete or partial response. The second study was an open label phase 2 study published in Lancet that evaluated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab in 106 patients with refractory multiple myeloma and 29 percent of patients experienced a complete or partial remission. These were patients that had failed at least 3 previous therapies . Daratumumab was overall well 
tolerated. Fatigue and an emia of any grade were the most common adverse events but no drug-
related adverse events led to tr eatment discontinuation. 
 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
The dose of daratumumab that has proven to be effective in patients with multiple myeloma is 16 
mg/kg started once weekly for 8 weeks followed by every other week for 16 weeks, and then once every 4 weeks thereafter. We will be using similar dose (16 mg/kg) and similar dosing interval for a total of 16 doses over a 24 week period. The drug is only available to be administered intravenously and we aim to use the same route of administration.   
Daratumumab overall is well-tolerated. The most common side- effect is infusion -related reaction 
(48%). We aim to use the same pre and post treatment regimen (including corticosteroid, 
diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) as has been done in the previous trials.  Serious adverse effects include anemia , grade 3 or 4 (19%), lymphocytopenia grade 3 or 4 (40%), neutropenia, 
grade 3 or 4 (20%), t hrombocytopenia, Grade 3 or 4 (18%), and increased risk of infection 
specifically p neumonia (11%) .  Common adverse effects include nausea (27% ), anemia all 
grades (45% ), lymphocytopenia a ll grades (72%), neutropenia all grades (60% ), 
thrombocytopenia all grades (48%), b ackache (23%) , cough (21%), upper respiratory infection 
(20%), fatigue (39% ), fever (21% ). 
 The treatment options for patients with PGNMID or C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy are limited with variable success. If untreated, majority of patients will progress to endstage renal disease. The current therapeutic options include rituximab vs. cyclophosphamide and prednisone with or without bortezomib. Daratumumab has a similar if not better side- effect 
profile to the above-mentioned treatment options and therefore we believe the risks associated with daratumumab are acceptable.   
2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective  
To assess the safety of daratumumab in patients with PGNMID or C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy.  Secondary Objective  To assess the efficacy of daratumumab in inducing complete or partial remission in patients with PGNMID or C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy as measured by change in proteinuria and serum creatinine.

3.1 General Design  
 
This study is an open- label phase 2 trial of the safety and efficacy of daratumumab , in the 
treatment of PGNMID and C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy.  Subjects will be screened at outpatient  Nephrology Clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will 
be consented and offered participation in this trial.  Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow -up for the next 12 
months.  Daratumumab will be administered once weekly for 8 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for 8 additional doses.  Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months (6 months after the last infusion).   A final visit for evaluation and collection of lab samples will be conducted at the end of the study.  
3.2 The clinical course of the patients who have achieved complete or partial remission 
following daratumumab is unclear, therefore these patients who have consented to the 
OLE  and achieved complete or partial remission, will be followed for 24 months 
following completion of the main trial. In the OLE, patie nts will be assessed  every 3 to 6 
months. Relapse is defined as a 30% increase in proteinuria from the lowest level the 
patient has achieved and will be documented with two 24 hour urine collections two weeks apart.  If there is evidence of relapse, patients will receive 12 additional doses of  daratumumab(16 mg/kg).  The first 8 doses will be given weekly and the last 4 doses will be administered every other week.  Primary Endpoints 
Incidence of major infection (defined as the development of pneumonia, severe urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, sepsis, meningitis), grade 3 or 4 anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia and changes in HgB, WBC count and platelet count from baseline to 6 month and 12 month timepoints. 
3.3 Secondary   Endpoints  
Proportion of patients achieving complete or partial remission where the responses are 
defined as below:  
a)  Complete Response at 12 months  
- < 300 mg proteinuria/24 hours 
- No greater than a 15% reduction in GFR as determined by creatinine 
clearance  
 
b)  Partial Response at 12 months 
- > 50% reduction in 24 hour proteinuria 
- No greater than a 30% reduction in baseline GFR as determined by creatinine 
clearance  
 
c)  No Response at 12 months 
- ≤ 50% reduction, unchanged or increasing proteinuria over baseline levels

5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
Daratumumab is an IgG1 -kappa human monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD38 
transmembrane glycoprotein on the surface of tumor cells and induces apoptosis. It appears in 
liquid form and is administered intravenously.   
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
 
The drug will be given intravenously at a dose of 16 mg/kg once weekly for 8 weeks followed by once every 2 weeks  for 8 additional doses 
 If there is evidence of relapse, patients in OLE will be treated with 12 doses  of daratumumab (16 
mg/kg). The first 8 doses will be given weekly and the last 4 doses will be administred every other 
week.   
 
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
 
This study is non- randomized trial and all 12patients that are enrolled in this study will receive 
darat umumab.

5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
 
Study drug will be prepared in the research pharmacy.   Pretreatment:  Fifteen minutes prior to the first infusion, 100 mg methylprednisolone will be 
administered via IV along with 1000 mg acetaminophen and 50 mg diphenhydramine given by mouth.  Fifteen minutes prior to all subsequent infusions, only 1000 mg acetaminophen and 50 mg diphenhydramine will be administered by mouth.    First Infusio n and those part of OLE being retreated due to relapse (16 mg/Kg): IV infusion 
in 1000 mL 0.9% NaCl  via 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line filter, beginning at 50 mL/hr. Increase by 
50 mL/hr every 60 minutes, as tolerated, to a maximum rate of 200 mL/ hr. Vital signs will be 
taken every 15 minutes for first hour, then every hour until end of infusion, and then again after IV flush.    
 Second Infusion (16mg/Kg):  IV infusion in 500 mL 0.9% NaCl  via 0.2 or 0.22 micron in- line 
filter, beginning at 50 mL/hr. Increase by 50 mL/hr every 60 minutes, as tolerated, to maximum rate of 200 mL/hr. If the first infusion was not well tolerated (infusion- related reaction > Grade 
1), then instructions for the first infusion should be used. Vital signs will be taken every 15 minutes for first hour, then every hour until end of infusion, and then again after IV flush.    Subsequent Infusions (16 mg/Kg) : IV infusion in 500 mL 0.9% NaCl  via 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-
line filter, beginning at 100 mL/hr. Increase by 50 mL/hr every 60 minutes, as tolerated, to 
maximum rate of 200 mL/hr. If the previous infusion was not well tolerated (infusion- related 
reaction > Grade 1), then instructions for the second infusion will be us ed. Vital signs will be 
taken every 15 minutes for first hour, then every hour until end of infusion, and then again after IV flush.    
 Infusion related reactions:  Diphenhydramine 25 mg IV can be given every 4 hours as needed 
and may repeat once if symptoms are not relieved within 15 minutes of initial dose.  Methylprednisolone 100 mg IV can be given as needed for infusion related reactions.    Post-infusion:  All patients should receive dexamethasone 4 mg by mouth once daily with food 
for two days beginning the day after daratumumab. In addition, acyclovir 400 mg by mouth twice daily , beginning within one week of starting daratumumab, and continuing for 3 months 
after the last daratumumab infusion.  Beginning the day after their first daratumumab infusion, 
patients will also start single strength Bactrim  once  a day (or its equivalent) to prevent 
opportunistic infections, including pneumocystis pneumonia . Treatment with Bactrim will 
continue for six months after the last daratumumab infusion.    A worksheet will be created specifically for this study, which would include a dose calculation with a double check by another pharmacist for added safety.  The drug will be prepared in the following steps.

5.5 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
 This drug is administered intravenously in the CRU and we can ensure compliance. If patient 
misses more than one infusion within the first 8 weeks or more than two  infusions in the 
following 4 months the subject will be withdrawn fro m the study. We will continue to follow the 
subject as part of the research study with blood and urine studies and clinic visits to ensure safety.     
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
 
The patient should be off of all immunosuppressive therapies (cyclophosphamide, MMF, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, ACTH) within three months of enrollment in the study. If patient has received rituximab prior to the study there should be evidence of B- cell reconstitution 
prior to enrollment (CD 20 count>5).  The subject should be off of prednisone or glucocorticoid equivalent in the last  6 weeks  prior to enrollment, unless they are being treated with low dose 
oral prednisone or glucocorticoid for a condition unrelated to PGNMID or C3GN (e.g., asthma, gout) at a daily dose of 10mg or less. Patients can receive ACE -I or ARB while enrolled in the study but dose adjustment is not 
allowed unless down titration for safety reasons.   Rescue treatment is not permitted while receiving daratumumab. If patient is  failing treatment 
with evidence of disease progression (> 50% increase in proteinuria and > 30% reduction in GFR based on creatinine clearance) on visit day 77, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and can then receive ot her immunosuppressive therapy per discretion of the treating physician.  
Management of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation 
Primary antiviral prophylaxis is permitted as per local standard of care.  Per protocol, HBV DNA 
testing by PCR is mandatory for subjects  at risk for HBV reactivation see Section 6. 
For subjects who are diagnosed with HBV reactivation while on treatment, study treatment should be interrupted until the infection is adequately controlled. If the benefits outweigh the risks, study 
treatment may  be resumed with concomitant antiviral prophylaxis as per local standard of care. 
Consult a liver disease specialist as clinically indicated.

2 Subjects  If hepatitis B results are positive HBV testing by PCR will be performed.  Subjects who are positive for Anti- HBc or Anti- HBs will undergo testing for hepatitis B DNA by PCR. Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV 
vaccination (Anti- HBs positiv ity as the only serologic marker) and a known history of prior HBV vaccination do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR. D uring and following study treatment, subjects who have history of HBV 
infection will be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of reactivation of HBV as specified in the Test and Monitoring Schedule Table above.  Local law requires positive test results be reported to local health authorities .   
3If HIVor Hepatitis C test results are positive a reflex test will be conducted to confirm  .  Local law requires positive test results be reported to local health authorities.   
 4 Serum pregnancy test for women with childbearing potential.  
5Daratumumab treatment affects pre -transfusion blood testing.  Therefore, in the event that a patient may need a blood transfusion Indirect  Antiglobulin Testing  will be performed at screening, prior to the first daratumumab 
infusion,  and the results given to patients to carry for the duration of the study. 
6 Urine pregnancy test prior to infusion for women with childbearing potential.  
7Pre- infusion medication methylprednisolone given prior to first infusion and only as needed for subsequent infusions for infusion reactions.   Pre- infusion medications acetaminophen and diphenhydra mine given prior to all 
infusions.  
8 In the OLE  patients will be followed clinically every 3 to 6 months , as determined by the treating nephrologist in consultation with the PI . If there is evidence of relapse defined as a 30% increase in their proteinuria  
from the lowest proteinuria level that the patient had achieved, patients will be treated with 12 additional doses  daratumumab  at 16 mg/kg.

  Page 21 of 40 7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
This is a proof-of-concept study and therefore a power calculation was not performed . The 
primary endpoint of this study is the safety of this drug in terms of incidence of rate of treatment 
emergent major infection, grade 3 or 4 anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia in patients with PGNMID and C3 GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy and the secondary endpoint is to the efficacy of daratumumab in this patient population. A paired t -test will be utilized to test the 
hypotheses described below.  Twelve subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
 7.2   Statistical Methods  
Descriptive Statistics  
Univariate descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be calculated, as appropriate for 
all variables.  Baseline values for demographic, clinical, and outcome variables (primary and secondary)  in each response category  will be tabulated. Time -to-response will be analyzed 
descriptively with Kaplan -Meier method.   
 For the primary endpoint, the number and proportion of patients w ith treatment- emergent major 
infections, grade 3 or 4 anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia will be summarized. Changes in Hgb, WBC count and platelet count from baseline (Day 0) will be analyzed through a paired t-test by comparing post- baseline to basel ine values. The secondary endpoint of the proportion of 
patients with complete or partial response will be summarized in a similar manner.  
 It is expected that 9 patients will enter the OLE. The rate of relapse in addition to the time to relapse from the last dose of daratumumab to initiation of retreatment will be evaluated. Paired t-test will be used to evaluate change in the proteinuria from time of relapse to the end of the study. Rate of CR and PR will be evaluated at the end of the OLE.    Handling of Missing Data This is a study of only 12 patients and expect that majority of patients will have complete data available.   
   Primary Hypothesis: Daratumumab is safe and well -tolerated in patients with PGNMID and 
C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy  
 To test this hypothesis, the incidence of major infection will be examined, specifically the development of pneumonia, severe urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, sepsis, meningitis will be reported.  In addition, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia will be examined by evaluating changes in   Hgb, WBC count and platelet count , respectively . Statistical significance will be 
assessed using paired t -test comparing 6 months and 1 year value compared to baseline. The 
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 22 of 40 number of patients who had to discontinue drug due to side effect (drop in blood counts, 
infection) will also be reported.  Second ary Hypothesis:  Daratumumab is effective in inducing remission (defined as 
improvement in proteinuria and eGFR) in patients with PGNMID and C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy  A paired t -test will be performed to assess change in  proteinuria and renal function at 6 months 
and 12 months compared to baseline (screening visit).  
      
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 23 of 40 Interim Analysis  
Inter im analysis will be done every  6 months to assess safety of the drug. The study will be 
stopped if four patients experience serious adverse events including infection, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia or leucopenia resulting in discontinuation of study drug.  A four person Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprised of clinical re searchers not 
affiliated with the study will be established and responsible for evaluating the ongoing progress of the study.  The DSMB will communicate by meeting every 6 months to review interim analysis .  The Chairperson of the DSMB will be notified of SAEs within 48 hours of them being 
reported and the Chair will have an additional 48 hours in which to respond and determine whether an emergency of the DSMB is required.  The DSMB  will act in an advisory capacity to 
the PI’s to monitor participant safety,  data quality and evaluate the progress of the study.  
7.2 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
All-treated population:  Any subject that received at least one dose of study drug. 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
The primary side effects associated with daratumumab include anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and these will be evaluated initially by monthly CBC done on Day 21, 49, 77, 105, 133, 161 and then every 3 months done on Day 264, 365. Further, the se will be evaluated 
during OLE laboratory assessments.  Other side effects include risk of infection specifically pneumonia and patients will be asked about any sings of symptoms suggestive of infection (e.g fever, cough) or any hospitalization, emergency department visits or other doctor visits at the clinical visits on Day 49, 77, 133, 161, 264, 365 and during OLE when laboratory assessments are completed or an infusion is administered Other side effects include symptoms of nausea and fatigue and similarly patients 
will be asked regarding these symptoms at the time of clinic visits  and during OLE when 
laboratory assessments are completed or an infusion is administered.  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to S ubjects or Others  (UPIRTSO)  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opinion of the local investigator may adversely affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 24 of 40 "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non- investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily 
have a caus al relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non - investigational) product, whether or not related 
to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. (Definition per International 
Conference on Harmonisation [ICH])  This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from t he 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal 
product 
• Is medically important*  
 and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opinion of the sponsor-investigator may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data.  
 *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should usually be considered serious.  NOTE: DEATH FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT.  
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 25 of 40  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
  
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 26 of 40 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow-up period is defined as 365 days following the last 
administration of study treatment.   
 Preexisting Condition A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  General Physical Examination Findings At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clini cally significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the sponsor- investigator until th e events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the sponsor-investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor-investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   Abnormal Laboratory Values A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if :  
- Monthly CBC shows that Hgb is < 8.0 g/dL  
- Monthly CBC shows that WBC is < 3.0  
- Monthly CBC shows ANC < 500 
- Monthly CBC shows that platelet count is < 50 ,000  
 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery For reports of hospitalization, it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the hospitalization that is the serious event for which details must be provided.  Any event requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization that occurs during the study must be reported as a serious adverse event, except hospitalizations for the following: 
• Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event (e.g., social reasons such as pending placement in long- term care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospitalizations that were planned before the start of data collection and where the underlying condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened will not be considered serious adverse events. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originally planned hospitalization is to be reported as a new serious adverse event.]  
• [For convenience the investigator may choose to hospitalize the subject for the 
duration of the treatment period.]  
  
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 27 of 40 8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the study team must seek information on adverse events by 
specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section  of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results should recorded in the source document.  All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still on going at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriated action necessary to protect the study participant and then complete the Stu dy Adverse Event Worksheet 
and log.  The sponsor- investigator will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up 
and reporting required.  
8.3.1 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB 
The sponsor-investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPIRTSOs and Non- UPIRTSOs 
according to the Mayo IRB Policy and Procedures. 
 Information collected on the adverse event worksheet (and entered in the research database):  
• Subject’s name:  
• Medical record number:  
• Disease/histology (if applicable):  
• The date the adverse event occurred:  
• Description of the adverse event:  
• Relationship of the adverse event to the research (drug, procedure, or intervention):  
• If the adverse event was expected:  
• The severity of the adverse event : (use a table to define severity scale 1 -5) 
• If any intervention  was necessary:  
• Resolution: (was th e incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment) 
• Date of Resolution:  
 
The sponsor- investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports 
need to be made to the IRB and FDA.  The sponsor- investigator will sign and date the adverse 
event report when it is reviewed.  For this protocol, only directly related SAEs /UPIRTSO s will 
be reported to the IRB.

Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
See Serious Adverse Event Definition in Section 8.1 above    Hospitalization  
See Hospitalization Definition in Section 8.1 above   Life-Threatening Conditions  
Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse event term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression/lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event definition.  
8.3.3.4 Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information  
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consi stent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For a medicinal product(s) with a marketing 
authorization, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the applicable product information.   http://www.darzalex.com/shared/product/darzalex/darzalex -prescribing-information.pdf
 
 For DARZALEX™ (daratumumab), the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the Investigator's Brochure.    
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 31 of 40 8.3.3.5 Special Reporting Situations  
Safety events of interest for a Janssen medicinal product that require expediting reporting and/or 
safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
• Drug exposure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal) 
• Overdose of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Exposure to a Janssen medicinal product from breastfeeding  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a Janssen medicinal product 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Janssen medicinal product  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a Janssen medicinal product 
• Medication error involving a Janssen medicinal product (with or without patient exposure to the Janssen medicinal product, e.g., name confusion) 
• Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via administration of a medicinal product 
•  Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a Janssen medicinal product 
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect ) of a 
Janssen medicinal product 
 These safety events may not meet the definition of an adverse event; however, from a Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC perspective, they are treated in the same manner as adverse events. Special situations should be recorded on the Adverse Event page of the CRF.  
Any special situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
  
 
8.3.3.6 Pregnancy  
All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC by the 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event  using the 
Serious Adverse Event Form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
 Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study and discontinue further study treatment.  
Because the effect of the Janssen medicinal product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects exposed to a Janssen medicinal product will be reported by the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event  using the 
Serious Adverse Event Form.  Depending on local legislation this may require prior consent of the partner.

Janssen Medicinal Products to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC  
All adverse events and special situations  whether serious or non-serious, related or not related, 
following exposure to a Janssen medicinal product are to be documented by the investigator and 
recorded in the CRF and in the subject’s source records. Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the adverse event to a Janssen medicinal product.  All (serious and non- serious) adverse events reported for a Janssen medicinal product should be 
followed- up in accordance with clinical practice.  
 
8.3.3.8.1 SAEs and Special Reporting Situations  
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until 
any of the following occurs: 
• The event resolves  
• The event stabilizes  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available  
• The event can be att ributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct 
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health 
care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow- up after  
demonstration of due diligence with follow- up efforts)  
 
The Mayo Clinic and the  PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR will transmit all SAEs , Adverse 
Events of Special Interest, and special situations following exposure to a Janssen product under 
study in a form provided by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC in accordance with Section 10,

8.4 Stopping Rules  
 
The st udy will be stopped if four patients experience serious adverse events  including infection, 
anemia, thrombocytopenia or leucopenia resulting in discontinuation of study drug.. 
8.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting” ).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events. 
8.5.1 Internal Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
A four person DSMB (clinical researchers) not affiliated with the study will be responsible for 
evaluating the progress of the study and will be provided data on a regular basis to monitor patient safety. This committee will communicate by meeting at 3 months, 6 months and then 12 months.  They will be responsible for determining if and when the study must be discontinued as a result of excessive adverse events. Study data will be provided to the DSMB by the data coordinating center (including all adverse event reports and the GFR data ).  The Committee will 
make its recommendations by periodically monitoring progress, data, outcomes, toxicity, safety and other confidential data, and may recommend stopping the clinical trial if an excessive number of serious adverse events are observed.

  Page 36 of 40 9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collecte d prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records 
include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial.  
 
9.3 Case Report Forms  
A Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed for each subject enrolled into the clinical study.  
The investigator will review, approve and sign/date each completed CRF; the investigator signature serving as attestatio n of the investigator responsibility for ensuring that all clinical and 
laboratory data entered on the CRF are complete, accurate and authentic.  
 The st udy case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or use “white- out” for errors.   For clarification 
of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date  it.  If 
the reason for the correction is not clear or needs additional explanation, neatly include the details to justify the correction.

Data Management Investigators will enter the information required by the protocol into electronic Case Report 
Forms  (eCRFs).   This study will use REDCap which allows web- based data entry, has edit 
checks,  audit trails, controlled access, and undergoes frequent back-up.   
 
  Data Security and Confidentiality  
All clinical data will be processed in a secure electronic environment that includes virus protection, and restricted access. Electronically stored data are subject to extensive security measures including virus detection, and restricted access.  Security measures in place for the database management sy stem proposed for this study include: browser security, firewall 
protection, user name/password protection, user re- authentication, and inactivity time -out. 
   Data Quality Assurance Quality control will take place at time of data entry (range, consistency checks) and will be 
ensured by oversight by the P.I. Before the enrollment of any subject in this study, designated study personnel will review with the investigator and personnel the following documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, eCRF s and procedures for their completion, informed consent 
process, and the procedure for reporting SAEs.  Information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is entered, safety information will be reviewed for completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to investigators.  By signing the protocol, the Mayo Clinic agrees to be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality control and quality assurance systems with written standard operating procedures to ensure that studies are conducted and data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol and accepted standards of Good Clinical Practice.    Data Clarification Process 
Data queries generated by identification of incomplete or inconsistent data will be raised directly 
within the electronic eCRF and should be resolved by the study coordinator or PI in a timely manner. Corrections or changes in the data management system are tracked with the retention of the original data and the corrected data with the date of data entry and submitting personnel.

10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
 The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the study -related documents an d study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  Data and safety monitoring provides a clinical investigation with a system for appropriate oversight and attention to the protection of human subjects by the investigator, research team, or an independent reviewer. A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is a quality assurance plan for a research study.  A written Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) prospectively identifies and documents monitoring activities intended to protect the safety of the subjects, the validity of the data and the integrity of the research study. The DSMP may also identify when to terminate a subject’s participation (i.e. individual stopping rules) and/or the appropriate termination of a study (i.e. study stopping rules). 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB, the 
sponsor, and government regulatory agencies, of a ll study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator 
will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  Particip ation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
government regulatory authorities and applicable compliance offices.

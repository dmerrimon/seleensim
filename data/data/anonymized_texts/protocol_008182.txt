Study  Title : A Phase 2a Multicenter Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability,  and 
Pharmacodynamics  of a Single Injection of a Long -acting Intravitreal 
Sunitinib Malate Depot Formulation (GB -102) in Subjects with 
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)  
Study Centers 
Planned:  Approximately 4 to 6 study centers in the United States  
Objectives:  Primary Objective 
To evaluate the safety  and tolerability of a single intravitreal injection 
of two different dose strengths of GB-102 (1 mg, 2 mg) in subjects 
with macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion who have received prior treatment with anti -vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
Secondary Objectives  
To evaluate the pharmacodynamic response as measured by best 
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CST) 
and time to first rescue injection.  
Study Design:  Multicenter, open- label, single injection, parallel arms, non-controlled 
safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics study.  
Eligible subjects will be consecutively enrolled  to 1 of 2  concurrently 
initiated open -label GB -102 treatment arms : 
Group 1 : 1 mg (50-µL) (N=10) 
Group 2 : 2 mg (50-µL) (N=10) 
GB-102 will be administered on Day 1 in both Groups ( Table 3 -1). 
Subjects will return to the study center on Days 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 for s afety and clinical assessments.  Subjects will exit 
the study following all study assessments on Day 180. 
The safety parameters to be collected include adverse events (AEs)  
and serious adverse events (SAEs) , physical examination, vital signs, 
BCVA using the  Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS) protocol, slit -lamp biomicroscopy findings, intraocular

date of administration of rescue treatment . 
Pharmacodynamic activity will be ass essed by means of BCVA 
(using the ETDRS Protocol), retinal central subfield thickness ( CST) 
using spectral -domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT), and 
color fundus photography (CFP) (including wide field fundus 
photography, if available) . 
Safety Monitoring 
The medical monitor  will evaluate the on- going open -label safety 
data.  
Masking This is an open- label study and the injecting investigator/physician  
may be the assessing investigator. The SD -OCT  and CFP technicians 
and other site personnel, the Sponsor, and CRO are unmasked to 
treatment assignment .  
Rescue Treatment  
Rescue treatment ( any anti -VEGF agent; aflibercept, bevacizumab, or 
ranibizumab) will be permitted in the study eye in any  of the study 
arms if the qualifying  criteria are met for rescue treatment . 
Study Eye Determination: The study eye  is defined as the eye that meets all  the inclusion 
criteria and n one of the exclusion criteria. If both eyes meet the 
inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, the eye with the worst visual acuity at baseline will be selected . If both eyes have the same 
baseline visual acuity, the right eye will be selected  as the study eye . 
Rescue Treatment Criteria: Rescue treatment (any anti -VEGF agent; aflibercept, bevacizumab, or 
ranibizumab) for all su bjects enrolled is  allowed at any visit following 
the Day 30 study assessments in subjects who meet any of the following criteria  regarding decrease in BCVA and/or increase in 
CST: 
Decrease in BCVA:  
o ≥ 10 ETDRS lett er decrease compared with best on-study 
(i.e., post- treatment)  BCVA ETDRS letter score  
Increase in CST (any  of the following criteria ): 
o ≥ 75 µm compared with the average of the last 2 on -study 
(i.e., post- treatment)  visit  CST measurements (µm) , 
and/or,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  6 13 November 2019  o ≥ 100 µm compared with the lowest on -study (i.e., post -
treatment)  CST measurement (µm) 
The investigator may elect to withhold rescue treatment if, in the 
opinion of the investigator, further clinical monitoring is warranted (e.g., subject has difficulty reading eye chart due to seas onal allergies 
and experiences a decline in BCVA but  the OCT imaging shows no 
evidence of fluid). 
Rescued subjects  will remain in the study for continued scheduled 
follow-up observation.  
Number of Subjects 
Planned: Approximately 20 subjects are planned: 10 subjects treated with 1 mg GB-102 and 10 subjects treated with 2 mg GB-102. There is no pre-
set limitation on the proportion of DME or RVO subjects per dose group.  
Target Population: Subjects eligible for screening must have a history of macular edema in the study eye  secondary to DME or RVO that was diagnosed in the 
6 weeks to 24 months prior to screening , treated with at least 3 prior 
intravitreal (IVT) injections of anti-VEGF (aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab), and demonstrated a response anti -VEGF treatment .  
The most recent anti -VEGF treatment must be administered within 42 
days of screening.  
The investigator will interpret SD -OCT used to determine subject 
eligibility; there is no third -party independent reading center 
confirm ation of any images during screening or 
treatment /observation.

Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administrat ion: GB-102 is a depot formulation of sunitinib malate  (sunitinib) 
intended for IVT injection. Sunitinib is a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase that inhibits multiple pathways associated with pathologic angiogenesis including VEGF receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2, and -3 known to be associated with macular edema. The formulation consists of microparti cles made from poly(lactic -co-glycolic) acid 
(PLGA) and methoxy-po lyethylene glycol (mPEG) -PLGA. The 
mPEG component provides a hydrophilic, biocompatible property. During production, the microparticles are surface- treated to facilitate 
their aggregation upon IVT injection to form a depot in the vitreous. 
After IVT injection, the microparticles degrade into lactic acid, 
glycolic acid , and mPEG. 
GB-102 is lyophilized and reconstituted with hyaluronic acid prior to 
intravitreal administration to produce an administered IVT dose of 1 mg  or 2 mg sunitinib  in a 50 µL injection using a 27- gauge  needle.  
Subjects will receive their assigned dose (1 mg or 2 mg GB-102) on Day 1  as a single IVT injection .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  11 13 November 2019  Reference Therapy, 
Dose, and Mode of Administration:  No reference therapy is provided in this study (ie, there is no active 
control arm) 
Study Endpoints:  
Primary Safety Endpoint  
• Occurrence of ocular and non- ocular adverse events and serious 
adverse events  at all study visits  
Secondary Pharmacodynamic Endpoints  
• BCVA (ETDRS protocol) at all study visits  
• CST (SD -OCT) at all study visits  
• Observed subjects rescue -free at each study visit  
Statistical Methods:  Analysis Population 
• Safety analysis set (SS) : Includes all subjects w ho receive a dose 
of study treatment. Subjects who receive rescue treatment during 
the study will be included in the SS. Subjects will be analyzed according to actual treatment received.  
• Full analysis set ( FAS ): Includes all subjects who receive a dose 
of study treatment, and complete the baseline and at least one post- baseline visit. All data collected from s ubjects who receive 
rescue treatment during the study will be included in the FAS.  
Subjects will be analyzed according to their assigned treatment regardless of actual treatment received.  
• Per protocol analysis set (PP) : Consists of a subset of the FAS 
and includes subjects with no major protocol violations that would affect the assessment of the pharmacodynamics and rescue data. Data collected after the receipt of rescue therapy during the study will not be included in PP analyses. 
Safety Endpoint Analyses 
All reported adverse events will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -emergent 
adverse events  (TEAEs) will be summarized by system organ class 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT).  Frequencies and percent ages will be 
provided by treatment group for subjects with TEAEs , treatment 
related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, serious treatment related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to premature study discontinuation and  TEAEs by 
maximum severity . Separate analyses will be performed for ocular 
AEs in the study eye, ocular AEs in the non-study eye, and nonocular AEs.

Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  12 13 November 2019  The SS will be the primary population used for analysis of the 
primary safety  endpoint. 
Pharmacodynamic Endpoint Analyses   
Observed values at each visit and change from baseline values at each 
follow up visit for BCVA, CST will be summarized using descriptive statistics (eg, means, median, range).  The FAS and PP will be used to 
analyze the pharmacodynamic endpoints.  
Sample Size Considerations 
The sample size of this study was  not selected to support specific 
statistical hypothesis testing. A sample size of approximately 20 
evaluable subjects in the SS analysis set  allows for detection of 
adverse events  rates that exceed 15% overall and exceed 30% for 
each dose with approximately 95% confidence. 
Missing Data and Sensitivity Analyses A minimal amount of missing data is expected since most subjects 
will undergo the proposed study assessments as part of their standard of care. There will be no imputation for missing data.  
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using the per protocol population.

1.1 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)  
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and is a 
leading cause of vision loss and blindness in working aged adults in the United States and the industrialized world. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is swelling of the central retina that causes vision loss and is an advanced complication of DR. The prevalence of DME increases from < 5% in subjects with recent diagnoses to approximately 30% in those with diabetes for two decades or more. Because the population of people with diabetes is nearly 300 million worldwide and growing rapidly, vision loss from DR is a significant public health  issue  (Nguyen  2010 ). 
Currently approved treatments for DME/DR include intravitreal (IVT) administration of anti -
vascular endothelial growth factor (anti -VEGF) agents , such as aflibercept ( EYLEA
®) and 
ranibizumab ( LUCENTIS®), or off- label use of bevacizumab  (AVASTIN®). Monthly or every 
other month administration of these agents have demonstrated stabilization or improvements in visual acuity and corresponding reductions in VEGF-mediated retinal edema as observed on optical coherence tomography. 
1.2 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (R VO) 
Retinal vein occlusions (RVO) is a blockage of veins that drain the retina and are a common type 
of retinal vascular disease, second only to diabetic retinopathy. The retinal vascular bed is highly organized with little or no overlap in vascular distribution. RVO occurs most commonly due to atherosclerosis of the high-pressure retinal arteries  that can compress and occlude the  
low-pressure draining veins. When retinal vessels are obstructed, there are few collaterals to compensate, and the retina becomes swollen and ischemic leading to the expression of VEGF which, in turn, leads to further vascular permeability and/or hemorrhage, and subsequent vision loss. RVO includes branch vein occlusions (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The inciden ce of RVO  is estimated at 180,000 eyes per year in the United States of which 
BRVOs account for nearly 80% ( Campochiaro  2010).  
Currently approved treatments for RVO (BRVO and CRVO) include IVT administration of anti-
vascular endothelial growth factor (anti -VEGF) agents of aflibercept and ranibizumab, or off-
label use of bevacizumab. Monthly or every other month administration of these agents have demonstrated stabilization or improvements in visual acuity and corresponding reductions in VEGF -mediated retinal edema as observed on optical coherence tomography. 
1.3 Unmet Need in DME and RVO: Less Frequent Injections  
Despite the effectiveness of IVT anti -VEG F agents to reduce the edema associated with 
DME/RVO, treatment requires frequent IVT  injections  to manage these often -chronic conditions 
–approximately every 4 to 8 weeks. An international survey of retinal specialists reported that
the most significant unmet need in managing retinal disease are long -acting sustained drug
delivery to reduce the treatment burden for both patients and physicians ( ASRS 2016).

Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  20 13 November 2019  To address the unmet medical need in patients with DME and RVO, Graybug Vision has 
developed a proprietary drug product (GB-102) intended to reduce the frequency of IVT injections (once every 6 to 12 months) and provide a mechanism of action involving blockade of multiple VEGF receptor targets associated with angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and cellular 
proliferation, which are key biologic processes associated with the progression of macular edema seen i n DME and RVO.  
1.4 Investigational Product 
GB-102 is a depot formulation of sunitinib malate intended for IVT injection. The formulation 
consists of microparticles made from poly(lactic -co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and  
methoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG) -PLGA. The mPEG component provides a hydrophilic, 
biocompatible property. During production, the microparticles are surface treated to facilitate 
their aggregation upon IVT injection to form an impla nt-like depot in the vitreous. After IVT 
injection, the microparticles degrade into lactic acid, glycolic acid , and mPEG . GB -102 has been 
engineered to deliver therapeutic doses of sunitinib for at least 6 months with a single 50- μL IVT 
injection based upon clinical data , theoretically enabling dosing twice yearly as descr ibed in 
Section 1.5. 
SUTENT
® (sunitinib malate) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the 
European Medicines Agency in 2006 in oral capsule form for the treatment of gastrointestinal 
stromal tumor and renal cell carcinoma, and in 2011 for the treatment of pancrea tic 
neuroendocrine tumor and represents a class of small molecules referred to as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
Sunitinib malate is a small molecule (532.6 g/mol) and is a multiple receptor TKI  that prevents 
receptor phosphorylation and “turns off” the downstream effects of selected receptors, 
particularly all the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR -1, -2, and - 3) (Figure 
1-1) which are known to influence macular edema . GB -102 offers the potential for more 
complete blockade of  VEGF -mediated angiogenesis compared to blockade of VEGF -A ligand 
alone (eg, aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab). A full description of sunitinib is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

1.5 General Information 
1.5.1 Nonclinical Studies  
Sunitinib malate has been evaluated in nonclinical safety studies in compliance with 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines to support its approval for cancer indications ( SUTENT
®). Nonclinical IND -enabling studies describing SUTENT’s primary and 
secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicology/toxicokinetics (single and repeat dose), genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, phototoxicity, and local tolerance (dermal and ocular) have been published in the literature and can be referenced in the Investigator’s Brochure for GB -102 (IB). 
A summary of the ocular pharmacology, tissue PK, and toxicology for GB-102 and sunitinib follows. 
1.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacology - Ocular  
Sunitinib has demonstrated evidence of inhibiting angiogenesis, vascular permeability, 
proliferation, and fibrosis – key findings associated with DME, RVO, and choroidal neovascular 
lesions in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).  
Sunitinib has also demonstrated evidence in neuroprotection. Single Intravitreal Administration of GB-102 Reduces VEGF -induced  Leukostasis and Retinal 
Nonperfusion VEGF plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy as well as nAMD. 
Increased levels of VEGF in the retina cause leukocytic plugging and closure of retinal vessel exacerbating retinal hypoxia, the main driver of progression of DR. Adult r ho/VEGF mice were 
given an intravitreous injection of 10 µg sunitinib (GB -102) or 40 µg of aflibercept in one eye 
and an equiva lent mass of empty microparticle s (MPs)  or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in the

non-adherent erythrocytes and leukocytes, and then perfused with FITC -concanavalin  A to stain 
remaining adherent leukocytes. Compared with eyes injected with empty MPs, those injected with sunitinib MPs had a significant reduction in the mean number of adherent intravascular leukocytes ( Figure 1-2 A). Similarly , aflibercept -injected eyes had a significant reduction in the 
mean number of adherent intravascular leukocytes com pared with PBS- injected eyes.  
Rho/VEGF mice also had fluorescein angiography at baseline and then were given an intravitreous injection of 10 μg of sunitinib (GB-102) in one eye and 10 μg of empty MP in the other eye. Some areas of retinal nonperfusion at baseline showed improved perfusion 1 week after i njection of GB -102, but this was not seen in e mpty MP -injected eyes ( Figure 1-2B )

Oral Sunitinib Malate Inhibits Choroidal Neovascularization ( CNV ) in a Murine Laser Injury 
Model 
The initial evidence to demonstrate the ability of sunitinib malate to inhibit choroidal 
neovascular permeability was in a laser -induced CNV mouse model ( Takahashi  2006). Three 
groups of mice (N = 5 per group) were orally administered 40, 80, 150 mg/kg sunitinib malate or vehicle for 5 days following laser endophotocoagulation of the ret ina and Bruch’s membrane. 
Permeability leakage of the CNV lesions was assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA) in vivo . 
Volume of the CNV lesions was quantified histologically in ocular cross-sections. The authors reported a dose-response in both the FA scores and histologic CNV lesion volume compared with vehicle control ( Figure 1-3).

Single Intravitreal Administration of GB-102 Demonstrates Sustained Inhibition of CNV in a 
Murine Laser Injury Model  for Up to 6 Months 
The murine model of laser- induced rupture of Bruch’s membrane results in C NV that is similar 
to type 2 C NV in patients with nAMD, because the new vessels originate from the choroid and 
penetrate through Bruch’s membrane and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) into the subretinal s pace (Data on file, 2019). Studies in this model helped to implicate VEGF as a 
critical stimulus for nAMD and predicted the clinical benefits seen with aflibercept, a recombinant VEGF- neutralizing protein commonly used to treat patients subjects  with nA MD. In 
order to assess the efficacy of GB -102 microparticles ( MPs) over time, C57BL/6 mice were 
given an IVT  injection of microparticles ( MPs) containing 10 µg sunitinib in one eye and empty 
MPs in the fellow eye and then had laser- induced rupture of Bruch’s membrane at 3 locations in 
each eye at time points ranging from 1 to 24 weeks after injection. Compared with empty MP fellow eye controls, the mean area of C NV at Bruch’s membrane rupture sites was significantly 
less in eyes injected with MPs containing 10  µg sunitinib at each time point through week 24 
(Figure 1 -4). There was significant suppression of C NV 0.5 months after injection of 40 µg of 
aflibercept, but not 2 months or 3.5 months after injection.

Sunitinib Exhibits In Vitro and In Vivo Neuroprotective Effects in Photoreceptors and Retinal 
Ganglion Cells 
Sunitinib malate was identified as one of the most potent small molecules in promoting retinal 
ganglion cell (RGC) survival and neurite outgrowth following high through- put screening of 
various small molecule libraries ( Zack  2011 ). The neuroprotective effects of sunitinib appear to 
reduce stress-induced apoptosis of RGCs in models of ischemia and optic nerve crush injury (Sharma 2011). Sunitinib also promotes photoreceptor survival and function as demonstrated in a 
murine light damage model of retinal degeneration ( Kim 2015).  
Intravitreal GB -102 has been shown to reduce photoreceptor death in preclini cal murine models 
of Type 3  CNV ( Figure 1 -5) (Data on file, 2019) Rho/VEGF mice were given an intravitreous 
injection of 10 μg of sunitinib microparticles (GB -102) in one eye and 10 μg of empty MP in the 
other eye or 40 μg of aflibercept in one eye and PBS in the fellow eye. At P42, mice (n=7 for each group) were euthanized and serial frozen ocular sections were cut from the superior pole of the eye (S0) to the inferior pole (I0) and sections 25% (S1 and I1), 50% (S2 and I2), and 75% (S3 and I3) of the distance between each pole and the optic nerve (ON) were stained with hematoxylin and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness was measured by image analysis by a masked investigator. The ONL of sections from the S2 location of GB-102- injected eyes 
appeared thicker than those from empty MP-injected eyes, but those from aflibercept- injected 
eyes appeared similar to those from PBS- injected eyes ( Figure 1-5 A). The mean (±SEM) ONL 
thickness was significantly greater at 3 of 6 locations in GB-102-injected eyes compared with

Single Intravitreal Injection of GB-102 Sustains Inhibitory Levels of Drug in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium -Choroid up to 6 Months in Pigmented Rabbits up to 6 Months 
Ocular tissue PK was conducted in male pigmented New Zealand rabbits receiving a single IVT administration of sunitinib malate GB -102 (1.0 mg/eye). Tissue levels of drug were determined 
in the posterior segment (r etina, RPE -choroid, vitreous humor) and anterior segment (cornea, 
iris-ciliary body, and lens) as determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry at 
various time points ( Peterson  2016).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  26 13 November 2019  Following injection, sunitinib drug levels are highest in tissues containing melanin pigment 
(Figure 1 -6). Tissue drug levels, in descending order, are as follows: RPE -choroid > iris- ciliary 
body > retina/lens > cornea > vitreous. There were no toxicological concerns related to  
pigment-binding discovered during preclinical testing. Drug concentrations of sunitinib are present in RPE-choroid and retina at 2- to 3-log orders higher than the kinetic inhibition constant
 
to suppress VEGFR through 6 months. The depot is fully resorbed by 12- to 14-weeks on ophthalmic examination. The sustained drug levels in the posterior segment tissue following resorption of the depot is attributed to the secondary reservoir effect of the RPE-choroid (melanin binding). 
Sunitinib was cleared from posterior segment ocular tissues with an average half- life of 
approximately 19 day s with a range of 2 -3.5 weeks. Peak exposure (T
max) was typically within 
3 to 4 months for retina and RPE-choroid, whereas vitreous T max occurred at 1 month. Given a 
Tmax at 3 to 4 months and a half-life of 0.64 months, sunitinib would be cleared from the 
posterior segment ocular tissues within 6 to 8 months.

Sunitinib malate was originally developed as an orally administered agent for the treatment of 
advanced malignancies at a daily dose of 37 to 50 mg ( SUTENT® capsules ) The steady state 
plasma levels of sunitinib at the oral recommended daily dose is approximately 60 to 100 ng/mL. Based on allometric scaling from nonclinical ocular PK  studies (rab bits, rats) to humans, it is 
estimated that a single orally administered approved dose of 50 mg sunitinib in man results in uveal tissue concentration of drug that are 1 -log to 2 -log orders higher than a single IVT 
injection of GB-102 containing 1 mg sunitinib ( Peterson  2016, Speed  2012).  
Three GLP ocular toxicology studies were conducted with GB -102: a single dos e study in 
rabbits, a repeat dose study in rabbits, and a repeat dose study in minipigs. 
The ocular toxicity following a single IVT injection (50 µL) of GB -102 at doses of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 
1.0, and 2.0 mg/eye in pigmented rabbits was evaluated in a GLP study with up to 19 weeks 
observation. Assessments were conducted with in vivo  ophthalmic examination, including ERGs, 
and postmortem histopathology of the enucleated eyes. The main findings included 1) time- and dose-dependent lens opacities, which w ere due to the high injection volume (50 µL), and 2) mild 
anterior and vitreous inflammation , which was due to endotoxin contamination of the test 
materials.  
In the repeat -dose rabbit study, animals received IVT injections of 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/eye 
GB-102 (in volumes up to 12 µL). Animals were injected on Day 1 and Day 141 over the course 
of 40 weeks. GB-102 was well tol erated compared to the GLP single dose ocular toxicology 
study in rabbits. The main findings in the repeat dose rabbit study included transient ocular inflammation at all dose levels regardless of dose volume, which was not test article related. Focal, peripheral and inferior lens opacities occurred in 3 out of 4 groups, which w ere test article 
related.  
In the repeat dose minipig study, animals re ceived IVT injections of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/eye 
GB-102 (in volumes up to 24 µL). Animals were injected on Day 1 and Day 141 over the course 
of 40 weeks. GB-102 was well tolerated based on all endpoint assessments including no findings on histology. There were no clinical observations of adverse events and no test article- related 
effects on hematology, coagulation or clinical chemistry parameters, which is consistent with a lack of detectable systemic exposure. The clinical ocular examination observations w ere limited 
to a transient, yellow discoloration of the vitreous humor and lens in some animals and there were no test article-related microscopic findings. Therefore, the no- observed -adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL) is above the highest dose (1 mg/eye) tested in this study.  
Overall, toxicology results indicate that IVT injection s of GB -102 twice with a 5-month interval 
and up to a 10-month observation period in rabbits or minipigs at a corresponding injection volume in the clinic , was well tolerated in the eye s and supports IVT administration of up to 
2 mg GB -102 every 6 months in the clinic.

3.1 Overall Study Design Summary  
This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, open- label, single injection, parallel arm, non- controlled safety , 
tolerability  and pharmacodynamics study.  
Eligible subjects will be consecutively enrolled  to 1 of 2 concurrently initiated open -label 
GB-102 treatment arms ( Appendix 18.1):  
Group 1 : 1 mg (50 µL) (N=10)  
Group 2 : 2 mg (50 µL) (N=10)  
GB-102 will be administered on Day 1 in both Cohorts ( Table 3 -1). Subjects will return to the 
study center on Days 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 for safety and clinical assessments. 
Subjects will exit the study following all study assessments on Day 180.  
The safety parameters to be collected include adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), physical examination, vital signs, BCVA using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol, slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings, intraocular pressure (IOP) meas urements, dilated ophthalmoscopy results, and date of administration of rescue 
treatment.  
Pharmacodynamic activity will be assessed by means of BCVA (using the ETDRS Protocol), retinal central subfield thickness (CST) using spectral-domain optical coherenc e tomography 
(SD-OCT), and color fundus photography (CFP) (including wide field fundus photography, if 
available).  
Safety Monitoring 
The medical monitor will evaluate the on -going safety data  in this open- label study . 
Masking  
This is an open- label study and the injecting investigator/physician  may be the assessing 
investigator. The SD-OCT and CFP technicians and other site personnel, the Sponsor, and CRO 
are unmasked to treatment assignment.  
Rescue Treatment  
Rescue treatment ( any anti -VEGF agent; afliber cept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab) will be 
permitted in the study eye in any  of the study arms if the qualifying  criteria are met  for rescue 
treatment.  
3.2 Study Design Rationale 
The proposed study is designed to assess the safety and pharmacodynamics of a single injection of 2 dose levels of GB-102 (1 mg, or 2 mg) administered in subjects with DME/ macular edema

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  31 13 November 2019  due to RVO who have demonstrated a prior response to at least 3 prior injections of any IVT 
anti-VEGF agent.  
The medical monitor will evaluate masked s afety data on an on -going basis.  
The planned study assessments (eg, AEs, abbreviated physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, BCVA assessments, IOP, slit-lamp biomicroscopy examinations, 
SD-OCT, CFP  (including wide field of view imaging, if available) , dilated ophthalmoscopy 
evaluations) are conventional parameters used to evaluate the safety and ph armacodynamic 
activity of pharmacologic agents in retinal disease.  
The sample size of this study was not selected to support specific statistical hypothesis testing. A 
sample size of approximately 20 evaluable subjects in the SS analysis set allows for detection of adverse events rates that exceed 15% overall and exceed 30% for each dose with approximately 95% confidence. 
Rescue treatment (any anti -VEGF agent; aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab) for the study 
eye is within the standard -of-care for subjects with DME/ macular edema due to RVO for the 
maintenance of visual acuity and/or the prevention of vision loss. 
3.3 Appr opriateness of Measurements  
The primary aim of the data analyses in this study is to assess the safety , tolerability  and 
pharmacodynamics of a single IVT injections of GB -102 in subjects with DME/ macular edema 
due to RVO who have shown prior response to IV T anti -VEGF agents.  
The safety , tolerability  and pharmacodynamic parameters to be evaluated in this study are 
consistent with landmark, randomized, multicenter, registrational drug studies of IVT agents 
used to treat DME and RVO ( Nguyen  2010, Campochiaro  2010).

5.1 Study Drug and Administration 
5.1.1 Investigational Product (GB-102) 
GB-102 is a depot formulation of sunitinib malate intended for IVT injection. 
The formulation consists of microparticles made from PLGA  and mPEG -PLGA. The mPEG 
component provides a hydrophilic, biocompatible property. During production, the 
microparticles are surface treated to facilitate their aggregation upon IVT injection to form an 
impla nt-like depot in the vitreous. After IVT injection, t he microparticles degrade into lactic 
acid, glycolic acid , and mPEG. GB- 102 microparticles are approximately 25 μm in diameter, 
which allows IVT delivery in a 50 -μL injection using a 27 G thin-walled needle in the inferior 
pars plana (6 o’clock region). The mPEG surface treatment of the microparticles facilitates aggregation into a single bioabsorbable, implant-like depot following IVT injection. This delivery method allows the microparticles to assume residence in the inferior portion of the posterior segment, away from the visual axis. The depot slowly biodegrades over 4 to 6 months. Because the released sunitinib avidly binds to ocular melanin, the RPE serves as a secondary drug reservoir to maintain therapeutic levels of sunitinib even though the depot i s fully resorbed.  
5.1.2 Study Drug Administration 
Each study center  will have a trained , technician who will prepare the study drug syringes for 
IVT injection . The Sponsor will provide the necessary training and all supplies required for the 
reconstitution of study drug, including vials containing lyophilized GB-102 dry powder, pre-filled syringe with hyaluronic acid , needles , and syringes .  
Rescue medication  allowed is any anti -VEGF (aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab) and 
should be used in accordance with the sites standard practice in administering these agents for the treatment of DME or RVO. The Sponsor will not supply rescue medication. 
Adequate anesthesia and eye prep aration materials (eg, p ovidone iodine solution) will be given 
prior to the IVT injection per the injecting investigator ’s standard -of-care. IOP measurement will 
be obtained before the injection  at Baseline (Day 1) . The investigational product, regardless of 
concentration, should be prepared and administered as follows in the study: 
GB-102: Reconstituted drug will be administered via IVT injection using a 1- cc tuberculin Luer 
Lock syringe with a 27 G thin -walled needle.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  40 13 November 2019  5.5 Study Drug Accountability  
The investigator must keep accurate accounting of the number of medication kits received from 
Graybug Vision’s designated vendor, the number dispensed to the subjects, and the number returned to the vendor during and at the completion of the study. A detailed dispensing record must also be completed. Only an appropriately qualified person must dispense the study medication to subjects in the study. The medication is to be used in accordance with the protocol by subjects who are under the direct supervision of an investigator. 
All clinical study medications/treatments and/or supplies should be stored, inventoried, 
reconciled and destroyed (on site) per site destruction standard operating procedure according to applicable state and federal regulations or returned to Graybug Vision’s designee for destruction. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All past and current use of therapies (eg, aflibercept, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, pegaptanib, 
and/or verteporfin) to treat CNV prior to screening will be recorded. The subject’s source record should include start and stop dates or dates of administration, doses, routes, frequencies, and indications for all therapies. 
All other medications (prescription, over- the-counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements 
taken by the subjects from 30 days prior to screening through the completion of the study will be 
recorded. Changes in the dosing and/or frequency of concomitant medications must be captured with new start and stop dates indicating the previous and current doses/frequencies. 
5.6.1 Rescue Treatment  
Rescue treatment (any anti -VEGF agent; aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab) for all 
subjects enrolled is allowed at any visit following the Day 30 study assessments in s ubjects who 
meet any of the following criteria  regarding decrease in BCVA and/or increase in CST:  
• Decrease in BCVA:  
o ≥ 10 ETDRS letter decrease compared with best on- study (i.e., post- treatment)  BCVA 
ETDRS letter score 
• Increase in CST (any of the following criteria):  
o ≥ 75 µm compared with the average of the last 2 visit on-study (i.e., post- treatment)  
CST measurements (µm), and/or, 
o ≥ 100 µm compared with the lowest on- study (i.e., post- treatment)  CST measurement 
(µm) 
Before rescue treatment is administered, the assessing investigator should confirm , if possible, 
with the medical monitor.  
Use of rescue treatment will be recorded on the case report forms (CRFs) and source documents.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  42 13 November 2019  6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study procedures to be conducted for each subject enrolled in the study are presented in 
tabular form in Table 3 -1. The procedures to be conducted are summariz ed by visit within 
Section  6.2. The investigator must document any deviation from the prespecified protocol 
procedures and notify the Sponsor or contract research organization if/when deviations occur. 
The protocol-specified procedures for a given study visit may be split across 2 days within the 
visit-specific window (if applicable); however, for each visit, all BCVA, ophthalmic examinations, and ophthalmic imaging  must be performed on the same day and cannot be split 
across 2 or more days.  
6.1 Subject Entry Procedures  
Prospective subjects who meet the entry criteria (inclusion/exclusion criteria) defined in  
Sections 4.3 and  4.4 will be considered for inclusion in this study. 
The study will be discussed with each subject and a subject wishing to participate must give 
informed consent prior to the study center performing any study related procedures or changes in concomitant treatment. All subjects must also give authorization and other written documentation in accordance with relevant country and local privacy requirements (where applicable) prior to the study center performing any study related procedures or changes in concomitant treatment.  
Each subject who provides informed consent will be assigned a screening number that will be used on all source documentation throughout the study. A subject is considered to enrolled into the study at the time of administration of the first dose on Day 1.  
Subject eligibility based on lesion characteristics must be determined by the investigating prior to subject treatment; there is no third -party confirmation of images obtained at screening or 
during the conduct of the study. In addition, screening laboratory test (i.e., hemoglobin A1c) must be performed, and the results must be evaluated and determined to be acceptable to the 
investigator prior to subject enrollment into the study.  
A urine pregnancy test administered to women of childbearing potential at the Screening  and 
Baseline visit must be negative for the subject to receive study drug at the Baseline v isit. 
6.2 Study Visit Procedures  
6.2.1 Screening (Day −30 through Day −3)  
The Screening Visit should occur 3 to 30 days before study Baseline (Day 1) to ensure that 
laboratory results are obtained and the investigator  has confirmed eligibility. The following 
procedures are to be performed at this visit:

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  46 13 November 2019  If follow-up is needed after the early termination visit, it should occur as a poststudy, 
unscheduled visit at the discretion of the investigator.  
Subjects with an ongoing SAE at this visit should be followed until the event resolves or 
stabilizes as described in Section 8.8. 
6.3 Screen Failures  
Subjects who miss a scheduled visit prior to the baseline (Day 1) visit or do not qualify for 
enrollment in the study will be considered screen failures.  
6.4 Unscheduled Study Visits  
Unscheduled visits may be necessary due to AEs or other reasons. The investigator may examine a subject as often as is medically necessary while the subject is enrolled in the study. Any follow-up that is performed to monitor subject safety should be recorded as an unscheduled visit. The following procedures may also be conducted at an unscheduled visit as well as any procedures deemed necessary by the investigator to assess safety:  
• Monitor and query AEs 
• Record changes in concomitant medications  
6.5 Subject Discontinuation 
Subjects should not be withdrawn due to an AE (unless related to subject death) , pregnancy, lack 
of efficacy, protocol deviations, or other reason except for the subject withdrawing consent, or being lost to follow-up. If a subject is enrolled in the study and discontinues from treatment, he/she should be encouraged to remain in the study through study completion to allow continued safety assessment and monitoring, unless the subject withdraw s consent.  
In the event of subject withdrawal prior to the end of the study, study assessments for the early termination visit should be conducted whenever possible. If a subject withdraws from the study, he or she may not re- enter the study. At the time o f withdrawal, the investigator should advise 
the subject of other available treatment options. When a subject withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal will be recorded on the CRF. 
In the event of a subject death during the study, the date of death (as listed on the death 
certificate) will be used as the date of study withdrawal.  
If a subject fails to return for a scheduled visit, it is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to document all efforts made to contact the subject and to  determine the reason the 
subject did not return. If a subject cannot be contacted with 3 documented telephone call attempts, followed by a certified letter, and does not have a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrawal of consent), the reason for discontinuation will be recorded as “lost to

withdrawal.  
6.6 Subject Replacement  
One rescreening of a nontreated screen failure subject may be allowed.  
If an enrolled  (i.e., treated) subject withdraws prior to Month 3, for any reason, the subject may 
be replaced following discussion with the medical monitor.  
6.7 Study Termination Criteria  
The Sponsor may terminate this study at any time for any reason. The Sponsor also may 
discontinue participation by an individual investigator or study center for poor enrollment or noncompliance. At the time of study termination, any active subjects should complete the early termination visit. All ongoing AEs should be followed as appropriate and all ongoing SAEs should be followed until the resolution or stabilization.

This section describes the study assessment procedures. Refer to Appendix 18.1 and Table 3 -1 
for information regarding the timing of each assessment. 
7.1 Demographic Data 
Demographic data will be recorded including date of birth, sex, eye color, race, and ethnicity. 7.2 Medical and Medication History/ Concomitant Medications  
Medical history will be recorded and should elicit all major illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries 
for the subject within the past two years prior to screening. All ocular history will also be recorded and should be specific to eye involvement, as appropriate. 
All past and current use of therapies (eg, aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab) to treat 
DME/RVO prior to screening will be recorded. The subject’s source record and CRF should include start and stop dates, dose, route, frequency, and indication. 
Other prior and concomitant medications taken from 30 days prior to screening through the last 
study visit will be recorded and will include any prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as herbal or nutritional supplements; the subject’s source record should include start and stop dates, dose, route, frequency, and indication. 
Prior SD -OCT assessments and visual acuity  values must also be recorded for the past 24 months 
if available.  
7.3 Physical Examination 
The physical examination will consist of, at a minimum, a routine evaluation of the organ 
systems including general appearance, neck, head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular, respiratory, abdomen, and skin/extremities. At the final study visit, the physical examination will include a query of the subject to determine if changes in his/her physical condition have occurred since the screening examination.  
7.4 Pregnancy Testin g 
Urine pregnancy testing will be conducted on women of childbearing potential as appropriate. Women of childbearing potential (ie, not postmenopausal for at least 12 months or not surgically sterile [bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oo phorectomy]) must have a negative 
urine pregnancy test at Screening  and Baseline, and must use adequate birth control throughout 
the study if she has a nonsurgically sterile male sexual partner. Adequate methods of birth control include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive device, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, and cervical cap with spermicide.

Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  49 13 November 2019  7.5 Blood Chemistry  
Blood samples for Hemoglobin A1c will be collected  using the site’s local laboratory . Samples  
and results should be obtained prior to administration of study drug. The minimum tests to be 
performed include the following: 
• Nonfasting chemistry (blood): Hemoglobin A1c 
7.6 Vital Signs   
Vitals signs will consist of blood pressure and heart rate measurements. Systolic and diast olic 
pressure and heart rate (bpm) will be measured after subjects have been at rest (seated) for at 
least 5 minutes. The same arm and method of obtaining blood pressure and heart rate should be used throughout the study. Measurements may be repeated once at the discretion of the investigator. Along with the vital signs, height (without shoes) will be measured at Screening and body weight will be measured at Screening and Month 6. 
7.7 Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
Manifest refraction will be conducted prior to BCVA. The BCVA assessment will be conducted 
for each eye, prior to dilating pupils, using the standard ETDRS protocol with back- illuminated 
eye charts. A study -specific manifest refraction and BCVA testing protocol is described in a 
separately provided BCVA  Manual.  
Visual acuity testing will be performed by a certified visual acuity examiner and should occur before any examination requiring contact with the eye. The same BCVA examiner should be utilized for each subject throughout the study when possible. 
7.8 Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy 
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be performed for each eye by a qualified assessing investigator at 
each study visit. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, including magnification, will be performed without dilation of the pupil and consistent with standard practice. The subject will be seated during the examination. This procedure should be conducted in the same manner for all subjects and will include an assessment of each of the following as normal or abnormal: 
• Eyelids  
• Conjunctiva 
• Cornea 
• Anterior chamber  
• Iris 
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  50 13 November 2019  • Pupil 
• Lens  
If any findings are abnormal, exact findings should be specified and noted as either clinically or 
not clinically significant.  
7.9 Intraocular Pressure  
IOP will be measured according to routine clinical practice using Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tono-Pen in both eyes at all study visits. At the Baseline (Day 1) dosing visit, IOP must be performed prior to dilation and the IVT injection of study drug. A single measurement will be made to obtain a determination of the IOP at each stu dy visit. Whether Goldmann 
applanation tonometry or Tono-Pen is used during the study, the Investigator’s standard technique will be used throughout the study. In addition, all reasonable efforts will be made to have the same examiner obtain all IOP measurements for a given subject using the same instrument for screening and the subject follow- up assessments for each subject.  
The Goldmann applanation tonometer or Tono-Pen instrument must be calibrated for accuracy before the first subject in the study at a given study center undergoes the first examination, and 
continue to be performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications until the last subject at the study center has exited the study. For detailed instructions regarding instrument calibratio n, refer to the calibration instructions supplied with the instrument.  
7.10 Dilated Ophthalmoscopy  
Dilated fundus examination of both eyes will be performed in all subjects by designated qualified study center personnel (i.e., an ophthalmologist). The following will be observed for the presence of abnormalities:  
• Vitreous body 
• Macula  
• Peripheral retina  
• Choroid 
• Optic nerve 
If any findings are abnormal, exact description of the findings should be specified and noted as either clinically or not clinically significant. All abnormal findings that are clinically significant and were not present at baseline, will be described and reported  as AEs.

Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  51 13 November 2019  7.11 Spectral Domain – Optical Coherence Tomography  
The SD -OCT imaging will be performed for both eyes to measure and assess cross- sectional 
images of the anatomic layers of the retina and to detect the presence of retinal fluid. Images will 
be obtained using a SD- OCT device by designated certified study center personnel. Preferably 
the same device will be used for screening and the s ubsequent follow- up assessments for each 
subject. For detailed instructions regarding collection of SD- OCT imaging, refer to the separately 
provided Image Acquisition Guidelines (IAG). 
7.12 Intravitreal Depot Color Fundus Photography 
CFP images will be taken on  each subject’s study eye to help identify the IVT 
GB-102 depot and the status of the visual axis. The initial images of the depot in the study eye, 
as well as the status of the visual axis should be obtained at baseline (Day 1) after the IVT 
injection and conducted through study completion at each visit for all subjects. Where available, Zeiss Clarus 500, Optos California Ultra -widefield or other specified Fundus Imaging systems 
should be used to collect these images. 
The photographs may be used to document the general appearance and rate of bioabsorbability of 
the depot and to confirm that the depot is not interfering with the visu al axis. For detailed 
instructions regarding collection of the IVT depot CFP imaging, refer to the separately provided guideline. 
7.13 Postinjection Assessments  
Following intravitreal injection of GB -102 at the Baseline (Day 1) visit, the subject should 
remain seated for approximately 15 minutes post- injection with minimal to no movement of the 
head (e.g., bending over, shaking head, laying down) and avoid significant eye movement. 
During this 15 minute- time period,  the injecting investigator/physician  will assess postinjection 
safety using count fingers or hand motion vision. The injecting investig ator/physician  can 
conduct additional safety assessments (eg, additional IOP measurement and /or ophthalmoscopy), 
if needed, prior to the subject leaving the clinic. All subjects will receive a telephone call from 
the study center the following day to ensure there are no significant complaints or AEs.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  52 13 November 2019  8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be monitored continuously during the study from the time that the subject 
has provided written informed consent through the subject’ s last day of study participation . The 
following information will be collected for all AEs and recorded on the subject’s source 
document and AE CRF:  
• Event description (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset and resolution dates 
• Severity (intensity)  
• Relationship to study drug or study procedure (c ausality) as determined by the assessing 
investigator 
• Seriousness 
• Expectedness  
• Action taken with study drug 
• Action taken with nondrug therapy 
• Outcome 
8.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug- related.  
An AE can therefore be:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended medical diagnosis, sign, or symptom 
• Any new undesirable medical occurrence or un favorable or unintended change in a 
pre-existing condition that occurs during or after study treatment 
• Vital sign or ophthalmic assessment that is assessed as clinically significant a nd different 
from baseline (eg , requiring discontinuation of study treatm ent, specific treatment, or a 
change in subject management) ; if possible, changes in laboratory results or changes in vital 
signs that meet the definition of an AE should be reported as a medical diagnosis rather than 
as the abnormal value (eg , “hypertensi on” rather t han “blood pressure increased”) 
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  53 13 November 2019  The following are special considerations when determining and reporting AEs: 
• Whenever possible, the investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis under a single AE term (eg, “ coug h, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be grouped 
together as “uppe r respiratory tract infection”).  
• Progression of neovascular AMD, including worsening of anticipated clinical signs or symptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy variable and assessed as unequivocally 
associated with the disease progression and/or lack of efficacy, should NOT be reported as AEs unless disease progression is greater than anticipated in the natural course of the disease.  
• A pre -existing condition is  not considered an AE  unless the condition worsens (increases in  
frequ ency, severity, or specificity)  during or following study drug administration . 
Fluctuations in a pre-existing condition should be assessed by the investigator, and those that fall within the limits of expected fluc tuations for the disease state ( and are not asses sed as 
worsening of the disease) should not be considered AEs . Any change assessed as clinically 
significant worsening of the disease from baseline must be documented as an AE. 
• Elective surgery or routine diagnostic procedures are not considered AEs. However, an untoward medical event occurring durin g the pre scheduled  elective surgery or diagnostic 
procedure should be recorded as an AE. 
• Death itself is not considered an AE; it is instead the outcome of an AE. 
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an  AE with an onset anytime from when the 
subject has received study drug through 30 days after the study ends whether or not it is considered causally related to the study drug.  
Note: AE s must be collected once informed consent has been obtained, regardless of whether or 
not the subject has been admini stered study drug. 
8.1.1 Severity   
Refer to Appendix 18.2 and Appendix 18.3 for definitions and assessment scales for ocular and nonocular/systemic AEs. 
8.1.2 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the investigational product using these explanations: 
• Unexpected : an AE  that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed.  
• Expected : an AE  that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been observed.  
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  54 13 November 2019  • Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the investigational product.  
Adverse events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/ mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation are to be considered unexpected.  
The investigator should i nitially c lassif y the expectedness of  an AE, but the final classification  is 
subject to the Medical Monitor’s and Sponsor’s determination. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Event  
All AEs will be as sessed as either serious or nonserious. A n SAE  is any event that involves or 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening occurrence (ie, if in the view of the i nvestigator or Sponsor, the event’ s 
occurrence placed the subject at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothe tically might have cause d death if it were more severe)  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  (hospitalization 
for elective surgery for a pre-existing condition or for surgery planned before study entry is not cons idered an SAE)  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial disruption of the subject ’s ability to perform normal life functions) ; this definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor or  temporary medical significance  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect (an AE that occurs in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to study drug prior to conception or during pregnancy) 
An important medical event or serious medical condition that does not meet any of the above criteria may be considered an SAE if, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it jeopardizes the subject or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospas m requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
8.3 Study Drug Causality  
The assessing i nvestigator will as sess the relationship of the AE to the study drug or study 
procedure as either related or not related. The following should be taken into consideration when assessing AE causality:  
GB-102 (Sunitinib Malate)  
Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  55 13 November 2019  • Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was  withdrawn and the 
AE resolved or the event recurred after re-introduction 
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an un derlying or 
concomitant illness  
• Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy 
• No temporal relati onship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists  
• If the AE is direc tly related to study procedures  
8.4 Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nonleading questioning of the subject at each 
scheduled or unscheduled study visit. At each visit, study personnel should ask the following question: “Have you had any problems since your last visit?” An AE  may also be detected when 
volunteered by the subject during and between visits, or through physical examination or other assessments. All AEs (serious and nonserious) reported by the subject will be reviewed by a qualified physician participating in the study and must be recorded on the subject’s source documents and AE CRF.  
All SAEs, whether or not related to study drug, must be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designated Pharmacovigilance contact  immediately  and must be submitted on an SAE report 
form within 24 hours after the i nvestigator becomes aware of the event.  
If an SAE  occurs, the study center  should immediately notify Graybug Vision email notification: 
GB102@oraclinical.com . The project manager will notify the medical monitor and /or the 
Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours).  
Alternatively, the investigator  may contact the medical monitor d irectly:  
 
 
 
 
 
Note that any SAEs that occur after the subject has  provided written informed consent, but 
before administration of study drug and are considered related to a protocol procedur e must also 
be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designated project manager within 24 hours after the 
investigator’ s awareness o f the event. 
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document an SAE before reporting the event to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designated project manager. If only limited 
information is initially available, follow -up reports a re required . Additional relevant information

Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  56 13 November 2019  such as hospital records, laboratory test results, or autopsy reports should be provided as soon as 
these are available.  
8.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Agencies  
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is considered “ unexpected ” if the event is not reported in 
the clinical safety section of the reference document (eg , an IB or package i nsert) or if the event 
is of greater severity or frequency than is reported in the reference document. 
Expedited reporting of SAE s is required for serious events that are both unexpected based on the 
reference document and consider ed related to the study drug (ie, the relationship cannot be ruled 
out). The Sponsor will determine which SAEs qualify for expedited reporting. Reports of those SAEs that qualify for expedited reporting submitted to regulatory agencies in 
accordance with  applicable local regulation (eg , 21 CFR  312.32). 
Expedited repor ts will also be distributed to investigators. Upon receiving such notices , the 
investigator must immediately submit a copy of this information to the governing institutional 
review board (IRB) in accordance with the board’s guidelines and any applicable local 
regulations. 
8.6 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy alone is not an AE. However, any report of pregnancy in a female subject at any time 
during the study and that becomes known to the i nvesti gator, must be reported to the Sponsor 
even if the subject is withdrawn from the study. The pregnancy should be followed to term, reporti ng the outcome after delivery . 
8.7 Overdose  
Overdose is defined as any dose higher than the protocol-prescribed dose of study drug. Occurrences of overdose leading to an AE will be reported on the AE CRF. Overdoses leading to an SAE will be handled in accordan ce with SAE reporting procedures. 
8.8 Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Subjects with an ongoing SAE will be followed until the event is resolved, the significant changes return to baseline, the condition stabilizes, the event is no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator, the subject withdraws consent, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study and that 
additional investi gation may be requested by the S ponsor. If the seve rity or relationship to study 
drug worsens for an ongoing SAE, a follow-up report should be sent to the Sponsor within 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the change in status.  
All nonserious AEs  will be followed through the last study visit. If a nonserious AE is first 
identified at the last scheduled study visit, the ev ent will be recorded on the AE CRF with the 
current status noted, but no further follow-up is required.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  57 13 November 2019  9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Methods of Analysis 
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted 
General descriptive statistics will be use d to evaluate the data ( eg, means, median, ranges , 
standard deviations). All summaries will be presented by treatment group and , where 
appropriate, by visit.  
9.2 Study Endpoints  
9.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
• Occurrence of ocular and nonocular AEs and SAEs 
9.2.2 Secondary Pharmacodynamic Endpoints  
• BCVA at all study visits  
• CST at all study visits  
• Observed  subjects who are rescue- free at each study visit 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
Three analysis sets will be de fined as follows: 
• Safety analysis set (SS) : Includes all subjects who receive a dose of study treatment. 
Subjects who receive rescue treatment during the study will be included in the SS. Analyses 
will group subjects according to the treatment actually rec eived.  
• Full analysis set (FAS):  Includes all subjects who receive a dose of study treatment,  and 
complete the baseline and at least one post -baseline visit. All data collected from subjects 
who receive rescue treatment during the study will be included in the FAS. Subjects will be analyzed according to their assigned treatment regardless of actual treatment received. The analyses conducted on the FAS will be considered primary for all efficacy analyses.  
• Per protocol analysis set (PP):  Consists of a subset of the FAS and includes subjects with 
no major protocol violations that would affect the assessment of the pharmacodynamics and rescue data. Data collected after the receipt of rescue therapy during the study will not be included in P P analyses. The PP analyses will be considered secondary for all efficacy 
analyses.

Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  58 13 November 2019  9.4 Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size of this study was not selected to support specific statistical hypothesis testing. A 
sample size of approximately 20 evaluable su bjects in the SS analysis set allows for detection of 
adverse events rates that exceed 15% overall and exceed 30% for each dose with approximately 
95% confidence. 
9.5 Analyses 
9.5.1 Safety Analyses 
All reported adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictiona ry for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) will be summarized by system organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  Frequencies and percent ages will be provided by treatment 
group for subjects with TEAEs , treatment rela ted TEAEs, serious TEAEs, serious treatment 
related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to premature study discontinuation, and TEAEs by maximum 
severity. Separate analyses will be performed for ocular AEs in the study eye, ocular AEs in the non-study eye, and nonocular AEs . 
The SS will be the primary population used for analysis of the primary safety endpoint. 
9.5.2 Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Observed values at each visit and change from baseline values at each follow up visit for BCVA, 
CST will be summarized using descriptive statistics (eg, means, median, range). The FAS and PP 
will be used to analyze the pharmacodynamic endpoints. 
9.6 Changes in the Conduct of the Study  
Only Graybug Vision may modify the protocol. Any change in study conduct considered 
necessary by the investigator will be made only after consultation with Graybug Vision, who will then issue a formal protocol amendment to implement the change.  The only exception is when an 
investigator considers that a subject’ s safety could be  compromised without immediate action.  In 
these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IRB must be sought, and the investigator should inform Graybug Vision and the full IRB within 2 working days after the emergency occurs.  
With the exception of minor administrative or t ypographical changes, the IRB  must review and 
approve all protocol amendments. Protocol amendments that have an impact on subject risk or the study objectives, or require revision of the informed consent document, must receive approval from the IRB prior t o their implementation.  
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to subjects, the informed consent document will be amended and approved by Graybug Vision and approved by the IRB; all active subjects must provide written informed consent using the revised consent form once available.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  59 13 November 2019  10 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Graybug Vision personnel (or designee) will visit the study center  prior to initiation of the study 
to review with the study center  personnel information about the study drug, protocol and other 
regulatory document requirements, any applicable enrollment procedures, source document 
requirements, CRF  completion , monitoring requirements, and procedures for reporting AEs, 
including SAEs. 
At visits d uring and after the study, the Sponsor and/or designee will monitor the study center  for 
compliance with regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete recording of 
data on CRFs from source documents, adherence to protocol, randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting , and drug accountability records.  
A Sponsor- designated  clinical data management group  will design and program a study database 
and corresponding CRFs, and will provide training for study centers  and clinical research 
associates  (CRA) on data entry and cleaning procedures. The data quality control and analysis 
will be performed by Graybug Vision (or designee), including study monitoring and clinical data management, based on a predefined data management plan and a SAP .

Protocol GBV -102-003  
Graybug Vision, Inc.  Amendment 1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  60 13 November 2019  11 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Electronic data capture will be used. Therefore, subject data from source documents will be 
entered directly into the clinical database at the study centers  using electronic CRFs . Designated 
study center  personnel mus t complete the applicable CRFs as soon as possible after a subject 
visit, and the CRFs must be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit. Prior to locking the clinical database, the investigator must review and approve the completed CRFs to verify their accuracy.  
Electronic CRF  completion guidelines that are approved by Graybug Vision, or designee, will 
designate how to appropriately enter data into CRFs from the source documents. Typically, blank fields are not acceptable. If a field is blank because the item was not done, the field will be marked “ ND.” If the item is unknown, the field will be marked “ UNK. ” If the item is not 
applicable, the field will be marked “NA.” 
Discrepancies (ie, queries) will b e generated for suspect data (eg , vital signs that are out of 
expected range, potential protocol compliance concerns, and date discrepancies) and missing data in the clinical database. Some discrepancies will be automatically generated during data entry into the CRFs as potential data quality  issues arise. Other discrepancies will be 
automatically generated after batch validation is executed on the clinical database during which more advanced, cross- panel edit checks are executed. Finally, manual discrepancies may be 
generated by investigators , CRAs, the clinical data manager (CDM), or clinical data analysts  as 
the study data is further analyzed during monitoring visits or data listing reviews. All discrepancies will be routed within the clinical database system to the appropriate clinical stud y 
staff, typically beginning with the study center  coordinator and ending with either the CRA or 
the CDM for resolution. When these discrepancies are opened within the system on CRF pages that have already been verified  by the CRA or approved by the invest igator, the database system 
will auto matically require the CRA to reverify and the i nvestigator to reapprove the applicable 
pages.  
Graybug Vision policy is that CRF study data must be verifiable to the source data, which necessitates access to all original  recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. In addition, 
all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The i nvestigator must therefore agree to 
allow direct access to all source data. Subjects must also allow acc ess to their medical records 
(ie, records at the study center  that have previous medical history/ information), and subjects will 
be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving written informed consent. If an investigator or institution refuses to allow access  to subject records because of confidentiality, 
arrangements must be made to allow an “interview ” style of data verification.  
A CRA designated by Graybug Vision will compare the CRFs with the original source documents at t he study center and evaluate the C RFs for completeness and accuracy. If 
necessary, the study center’s  personnel will be contacted for corrections and/or clarifications. 
Data that are modified in the clinical database to resolve related discrepancies must be supported in the source document s.

Qualified individuals designated by Gra ybug Vision will monitor all aspects of the study 
according to ICH and GCP and standard operating procedures for compliance with applicable 
government regulations. The investigator agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the 
clinical supplies, disp ensing, and storage areas and to the clinical files, including original 
medical records, of the study subjects, and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The investigator  and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation dur ing 
routinely scheduled study center  visits conducted by Graybug Vision, the contract research 
organization, or its designees. A review of the subjects ’ medical records will be performed in a 
manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is adequately maintained. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring p lan. 
Members of Graybug Vision GCP Compliance Department or designees may conduct an audit of 
a study center  at any time during or after completion of the study. The investigator  will be 
informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other regulatory a gencies may  also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such 
an inspection, the investigator  should notify Graybug Vision immediately. The investigator will 
ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study center  facilities, original source  
documentation, and all study files. All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state , 
and federal laws apply.

The investigator mu st retain all study records required by Graybug Vision and by the applicable 
regulations in a secure and safe facility. The investigator must consult a Graybug Vision 
representative before disposal of any study records, and must notify Graybug Vision of an y 
change in the location, disposition, or custody of the study files. The investigator /institution must 
take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of study records (eg , subject charts) , as well 
as any original source documents that are electronic as required by applicable regulatory requirements.  
All study rec ords must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in the US or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the US or an ICH region or (2) at least 2 years have elaps ed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study drug . The investigator /institution 
should retain subject identifiers for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of the study. Subject files and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution , or private practice, but not less than 15 years. These 
documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by a Graybug Vision agreement. Graybug Vision must be notified and will assist with retention should the investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of Graybug Vision to inform th e investigator /institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  71 13 November 2019  18.2 Nonocular and Systemic Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The NCI -CTCAE (version  4.03) is a descriptive terminology that will be used to grade the 
severity of nonocular and systemic  AEs report ed in this study. 
The NCI -CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for 
each AE based on this general guideline:  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation 
only; intervention not indicated 
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting  
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)*  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limited self-care ADL**  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indi cated  
Grade 5:  Death related to an AE  
A semicolon indicates “or” within the above descriptions. A single dash (-) can be used to indicate that a grade is not available. Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than 5 options for grade selection. 
* Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc 
** Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, takin g 
medications, and not being bedridden.

The severity of an ocular AE will be  defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of 
intensity of an ocular AE  as determined by the investigator or reported to hi m/her by  the subject. 
The assessment of severity will be  made irrespective of relationship to investigational product or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild: Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tole rated and does not interfere with the 
subject ’s daily activities  
• Moderate:  Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities  
• Severe:  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities

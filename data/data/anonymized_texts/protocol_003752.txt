Protocol version date 05/09/18  Page 7 of 39 1.0 Introduction and Background  
Tax
ane chemotherapies such as paclitaxel and docetaxel have had an increasing role in the 
treatment of breast cancer and are now used in the majority of patients receiving perioperative 
chemotherapy.1 Taxanes exert their effect by excess stabilization of microtubules which 
disrupts the mitotic spindle of dividing cancer cells. However, healthy neuronal cells also rely on functional mitrotubules in their axons and dendrites for both structural support and transport of intracellular products. Disruption of these neuronal microtubules leads to a dose- dependent 
peripheral neuropathy that is the  dose- limiting toxicity of taxanes.
2 Taxane- induced peripheral 
neuropathy (TIPN) initially tends to manifest as a progressively worsening sensory impairment  
which is often felt as painful paresthesias with decreased deep tendon reflexes;  this may be 
followed by a delayed motor deficit causin g distal weakness.3 TIPN is often  reversible if it is 
intervened upon early enough with dose reduction or discontinuation of taxane treatment s; if 
treatment is continued there is higher risk of irreversible symptoms .4 A retrospective clinical 
practice study of early -stage taxane- treated breast cancer patients found that 10% of them had 
dose- limiting TIPN; roughly half of whom  had early  discontinuation of treatment with  an 
average 28% lower cumulative taxane dose than planned.5 When chemotherapy  cannot be 
given as intended due to dose reductions it is  generally associated with worse outc omes ,6 
suggesting that TIPN may have an indirect effect upon overall survival in some breast cancer 
patients.  
TI
PN manifests via several different pathophysiological mechanisms that can be assessed by 
current modalities ; none of which have yet emerged as a widely -adopted standardized 
approach.  Taxane disruption of microtubules impairs  the normal self -maintenance of neurons  
which is evident structurally as the degeneration of distal axons and nerve terminals . 
Inflammatory changes occur as the innate immune system responds to these damaged and leaking organelles. Genetic polymorphisms in neuronal and inflammatory cells contribute to individual variability in TIPN vulnerability. Functionally,  as a neuronal myelin sheath 
deteriorates it increases the membrane surface area through which current must flow, slowing electrical  conduction velocity and weakening its signal amplitude. Finally,  as a result  of the 
above mechanisms , degradation and inflammation can alter lar ge peripheral nerves to the 
point that gross  anatomic  changes are evident on imaging.  
Ul
trasound (US) is a non- invasive, non- irradiating , emerging imaging modality which can be 
used to assess peripheral nerves. Nerve fiber cross- sectional area (CSA) , echo genicity, and 
vascularity are assessed and provide an indication of nerve health and potential pathology. The majority of US  data have been published  on detection of entrapment syndromes such as 
carpal tunnel syndrome. In these cases the most common US findings include nerve enlargement , decreased echogenicity proximal to the entrapment , and an increase in nerve 
vascularity .
7 Other studies have found that US can detect other peripheral nerve lesions or 
neuropathies, wi th the most reliable finding a change in nerve CSA. Ultrasound measurements 
of the sensory sural nerve at the distal calf in healthy participants without neuropathy had an average CSA of 5.3 mm
2 with standard deviation 1.8 mm2 for a normal reference range of 1.7-
8.9 mm2.8 Another ultrasound study assessed the sural nerve more distally at t he ankle and 
found a smaller CSA  which was significantly enlarged (p <0.001) in patients with diabetic

neuropathy as compared to healthy controls (mean/standard deviation 2.59 / 0.96 mm2 as 
compared to 1.40 / 0.59 mm2).9 
To
 date, there has only been one small study assessing US detection of chemotherapy-
induced peripheral neuropathy; this was done amo ng colorectal cancer patients who had 
received oxaliplatin. Similar to several  other etiologies of nerve lesions/neuropathies, this study 
also found an increased peripheral nerve CSA compared to reference values. Interestingly, 
although the patients had denied symptoms of neuropathies at time of recruitment, this study found areas of increased peripheral nerve CSA at upper extremity  sites of entrapment such as 
the carpal tunnel and ulnar groove; it did not find US abnormalities  in terms of CSA or 
echogenici ty at the sural nerve or other sites .
10 Oxaliplatin has a much different mechanism of 
action from the taxanes; as a platinum -based agent it causes DNA cross -linking which  inhibits 
cancer cell growth. Oxaliplatin- induced neuropathy is also a distinct entity that is characterized 
by cold sensitivity and mediated by prolonged opening of sodium ion channels along neuronal axons.
11 On a review of publications in the MEDLINE database as well as  abstracts from the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology, we did not find any other prior studies  that focused on 
the use of US to detect chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy, and none for TIPN.  
As
 noted above, there are currently several different diagnostic modalities that can assess 
TIPN , including  self-reported symptoms, physical examination, nerve conduction study, 
sudometer testing, and skin biopsies. But each have limitations  so that  none have emerged as 
a widely -adopted standardized approach. 
In r
outine practice, most clinicians rely on patients’ self -reported symptoms alone for TIPN 
detection. These symptoms can be measured on one of several clinician- administered grading 
scales, although these have inter -scale and inter-observer variability.12 The European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC)  QLQ -CIPN20 Questionnaire is 
a 20- item self -reported survey that is easy to administer and was validated across participants 
in four large cooperative group trials.13 Furthermore, although in many patients the 
development of acute TIPN symptoms is predictive of eventual chronic TIPN,14 some patients 
develop a disproportionately delayed TIPN that is not able to be self -reported early enough to 
allow for intervention.  
The
 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC)  QLQ -CIPN20 
Questionnaire  is a 20- item self -reported survey that is easy to administer and was validated 
across participants in four large cooperative group trials.13 The QLQ -CIPN20 sensory scale 
has been studied specifically with TIPN among breast cancer patients and was shown to be correlated with patient -reported symptoms from the Common Toxicity Criteria (0.79, p < 
0.00001). Since taxanes are not associated with hearing loss, that corresponding item was excluded from analysis in that study .
15 For normative comparison, non- cancer patients tend to 
have very low scores on the QLQ -CIPN20 with a sum score average of 3.6 (standard deviation 
7.2) and subtotals of 3.2 (7.3) for sensory measures, 3.8 (9.2) for motor, and 4.4 (10.7) for autonomic. The vast majority of non- cancer patients (90.1%) had a sum score of 0- 10%; older 
age and self -reported comorbidities were associated with higher QLQ -CIPN20 scores. Based 
on the results from that study, age- matched normative data has been generated for the QLQ -
CIPN20.

sical examination with quantitative sensory testing (QST) uses tuning forks or 
monofilaments to objectively measure the sensory threshold for proprioception. QST may be a 
useful addition to self -reported symptoms as it is non -invasive, easily implemented, and well -
correlated w ith self -reported TIPN symptoms. Although promising, it has not been shown to 
provide early detection of subclinical TIPN .17,18 
Nerv
e conduction studies  (NCS) measure impairment of electrical function in large peripheral 
nerves and are thought to be a sensitive and specific measure of TIPN. NCS measures 
amplitude and latency of neuronal signaling.  Reduction in the conduction velocity within a 
peripheral nerve indicates damage to the myelin, while reduction in the amplitude indicates 
axonal damage.  Typical NCS findings suggestive of TIPN include  slowed conduction velocity 
at common sites of entrapment (such as the carpal tunnel)  and an earlier reduction of sural 
sensory amplitude relative to the radial nerve.19 A prospective study of patients receiving 
paclitaxel and carboplatin found a reduction in sural nerve conduction from baseline in terms of the sensory action potential amplitude (14.5 +/ - 9.0 uV to 9.7 +/ - 7.1) and the sensory 
conduction velocity (54.6 +/ - 7.7 m/s to 46.3 +/ - 8.8).
20 A series of patients who received 
paclitaxel and cisplatin had a reduction in the sural nerve amplitude of sensory action potential 
from average 13.7 uV (standard deviation 6.5) to 6.5 (standard deviation 4.1).21 However, NCS 
are invasive; can be mildly painful for the patient ; require expertise and time to administer;  and 
can only detect TIPN once it has progressed to the point that there is functional impairment of large peripheral nerves ; these  problems make it le ss preferable for  the routine clinical 
evaluation for TIPN -like symptoms .
22 Other functional assays besides NCS have been 
investigated. Sudomotor testing is a novel  technique that uses the topical administrat ion of 
acetylcholine to meas ure the sweat response that is mediated by the small fibers of peripheral 
nerves . Although non- invasive, sudomotor testing  tends to have wide variability which can 
make interpretation difficult  and it has not yet been tested in chemotherapy -induced peripheral 
neuropathy .  A n erve excitability study is a novel non- invasive functional assay that detects the 
threshold of current that is needed to elicit an action potential . Similar to US , this experimental 
technique has been shown that it can detect oxaliplatin -induced peripheral  neuropathy;23 but 
has not yet been studied for TIPN.  
Sk
in biopsies are able to detect TIPN with good diagnostic sensitivity that may be superior to 
NCS in chronic TIPN.24 Measurement of the intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density is a 
standard clinical assessment used in the evaluation of peripheral neuropathies. Healthy control participants have an average IENF density of 21.1 (standard deviation 10.4) at the thigh and 
13.8 ( standard deviation 6.7) in the distal l eg.
25,26 Typical IENF density findings in TIPN include 
reduced nerve fib er density  that is typically more pronounced distally at the lower leg (mean 
3.0, range 0.5- 6.3) as compared to the thigh ( mean 5.5,  range  0.7-13.2).27 As expected, the 
IENF density likely continues to decrease with continued exposure to chemotherapy and worsening neuropathy, as a small longitudinal study of patients receiving oxaliplatin found that the distal leg IENF density progressively decreased from baseline 15.39 (6.75) to 12.89 (4.73) at 6 months to 9.45 (3.92) at 12 months.
28 However, IENF density has not been shown to be 
predictive of chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy and , similar to NCS, skin biopsies 
are invasive and may be mildly painful.

e inflammatory mechanism by which TIPN  causes neurotoxicity is poorly understood. Mast 
cells may h ave a role in the pathophysiology of some other types of chemotherapy -induced 
peripheral neuropathy. A mouse study found that prevention of mast cell degranulation by a 
congenital mast cell deficiency or administration of a mast cell stabilizer could prevent oxaliplatin neuropathy.
29 Mast cell markers can be detected in serum and increased number or 
atypia of mast cells can be detected on skin biopsy.  
Gi
ven the lack of a consensus approach to the diagnosis of TIPN, further research is needed 
to better characterize TIPN that ideally uses non- invasive methods  to facilitate serial 
measurements if they are needed. The accurate assessment of TIPN allows for appropriate 
adjustment of taxane chemotherapy dosing and potential improvement of clinical outcomes in 
breast cancer patients. This pilot study will assess the utility of  ultrasound as a novel technique 
to assess TIPN .

1 Women of all races and ethnicity who meet the above- described eligibility criteria 
are eligible for this trial.  
3.3.
2 The study consent form will also be provided in Spanish for Spanish- speaking 
participants.  Male patients  will be excluded as the frequency  of breast cancer  
among males  is low and  the frequencies needed to treat men for male breast 
cancer are currently unknown; therefore,  100% of participants to be women. We 
plan to enroll at least 20% Black or African American (N= 4). Because of the low 
incidence  among American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian , and Hispanic/Latino 
women in our catchment area, we do not expect accruals of individuals of those 
ancestries ; however, no ancestry background is being excluded.  Should we not 
meet or exceed these estimates, the PI will engage the Cancer Center Health Equity Advisory Group to discuss strategies to enhance recruitment in these target populations.

4.3 Study setting 
Enrollment of participants will be take place at WFBMC Comprehensive Cancer Center  
(CCC) outpatient clinics.
4.4 Enrollment (Encounter 1)  
Recruitment information will be  posted in the CCC outpatient clinics in the rooms where 
breast cancer patients are treated. Study investigators will also review medical records 
and work with WFBMC clinicians to identify patients who would potentially meet inclusion criteria. If a breast  cancer patient expresses interest in enrollment on the 
study, a study investigator or research employee will meet the patient in clinic to ensure that they are eligible and to obtain consent for enrollment on the study.  We anticipate an 
accrual rate of 1- 2 participants per month. This is feasible because 242 breast cancer 
patients received taxanes (52% paclitaxel, 45% docetaxel) in 2016 at the WFBCCC alone and with additional breast cancer patients treated at the Clemmons satellite office.  
4.5 Clinical assessment  (Encounter 2)  
Clinical assessment will take place in the CCC outpatient clinic and will include a focused history by one of the study investigators or research employees.  The medical

ord will also be reviewed to confirm details of the medical  history. The focused 
history will assess  age, body -mass index (BMI),  breast cancer staging, types and 
dosages of chemotherapy received,  corticosteroid and analgesic use,  and presence of 
comorbidities (diabetes, B12 deficiency, thyroid disorders, alcoholis m, depression, 
carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica).  . A physical examination will occur to document 
strength and reflexes . The QLQ -CIPN20  questionnaire will also be administered at this 
encounter.  
In 
most cases, blood testing will be added on to regularly s cheduled phlebotomy for 
clinical labs which are drawn as part of routine oncology care. Some participants may 
require an additional blood draw if insufficient blood samples were collected. For the purposes of our study, 12mL of venous blood will be collect ed in a sodium heparin 
(green -top) collection tube and then transferred directly to Dr. Shiozawa’s lab for 
processing.  
Blood Sample Preparation  
1.Ema
il notification will be sent to Matt Eber ( meber@wakehealth.edu) , Sun Park
(shpark@wakehealth.edu) and Yusuke Shiozawa (yshiozaw@wakehealth.edu) the day
before the blood collection.
2.Bl
ood will be collected in two green- top vacutainer tubes containing heparin (60 USP Units of
Lithium Heparin/ 6ml tube), and immediately inverted 8- 10 times to prevent coagulation.
Attention: Protocol #: CCCWFU # (97217 ) and the ORIS PID  in addition to the other
standard information should be on the tube.
3.Samples will then be transported from the Cancer Center to the Shiozawa lab (Lab: 3 -6624,
3-5119, Office: 6 -8743).
4.6 Diagnostic testing (Encounter 3) 
Participants will be referred to Diagnostic Neurology clinic for and abbreviate 
neurological exam to assess strength of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius and deep tendon reflex exam of the Achilles tendon on the limb to be examined in nerve 
conduction studies and ultrasound evaluation  during this encounter. Further, a skin 
biopsy will be obtained.  These tests will  be completed at a single visit and no further 
follow -up with neurology is required as part of the study protocol.  All of these studies are 
considered standard clinical tests for the evaluation of peripheral neuropathy and sensory neuropathy.  Patients will receive a Visa gift card upon completion of the 
neuropathy assessment.  
Per
ipheral nerve US technique and reference values for the sural sensory (measured at 
the ankle) and tibial motor nerves are based on institutional data and standard institutional practice. These reference values were de- identified historical data which 
have also been published by Cartwright et al .(2008)  
8 as noted in the Introduction and 
Background section.  Peripheral nerves will be assessed at non- compressive sites with a 
routine 15Hz linear probe. If available, a higher resolution 70Hz linear probe may be 
used – this would allow for descriptive characterization of nerve changes and would not

standard 15Hz US.  
NC
S technique and reference values for the sural and tibial nerves among healthy 
adults are based on data from Chen et al. (2016)  and standard institutional practice 30. 
NCS assessment of the sural sensory nerve involves electrode placement at the ankle 
(posteroinferior to the lateral malleolus) and more distally with a 3cm bar for a distance 
of approximately 14cm; the nerve is stimulated at the calf midline with a display sensitivity 2 -5 uV/div and sweep of 1 ms/div. The sural sensory nerve reference values 
for amplitude is a lower limit (3
rd percentile) of 4 uV (onset -to-peak) and 4 uV (peak -to-
peak); and for latency is an upper limit (97th percentile) of 3.6 ms (onset) and 4.5 ms 
(peak). NCS assessment of the tibial motor nerve involves electrode placement at the medial foot (slightly anterior/inferior to the navicular tubercle) and more distally at the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint for a distance of approximately 8cm; the nerve is stimulated at the ankle (posterior to the medial malleolus) and knee (at the midpopliteal fossa) with a display sensitivity 5 mV/div and sweep of 5 ms/div. The tibial motor nerve reference values for distal amplitude is a lower limit (3
rd percentile) of 4.4 mV across all 
ages; and for distal latency is an upper limit (97th percentile) of 6.1 ms.  
Tw
o skin  biops ies will be obtained as 4-5 mm punch biopsies at distal end of leg in sural 
nerve territory (10cm above lateral malleolus)  and in the upper thigh. As described in a 
review by Lauria and Devigili  (2007) ,31 biopsied tissue will be cut into 50 uM sections 
which will be hematoxylin and eosin stained and also immunostained with an antibody 
to PGP (protein gene product) 9.5, a neuron - and neuroendocrine cell -specific ubiquitin 
carboxy -terminal hydrolase expressed throughout the peripheral nervous system. Slides 
will be reviewed by Dermatopathology (Dr. Ahn and/or  Dr. Sangueza) in order  to count 
PGP9.5 -positive fibers as they cross the dermal -epidermal junction to calculate linear 
density of IENF (IENF/mm).  Additional staining will be done as indicated.  Routine 
processing of specimens and comparison to standardized values (similar to those 
described by McArthur et al .(1998 ))25 will be done by Dermatopathology  as per their 
institutional  guidelines. These methods are standard clinical procedures for the routine 
assessment of IENF density. Dermatopathology will also obtain descriptive measures of morphologic changes that will be analyzed as an exploratory outcome. Additional unstained slides or blocks will be stored and transferred to Dr. Shiozawa’s lab for staining and testing of mast cell concentration, tryptase, chymase and histamine. The 
results will be recorded on Appendix E for transfer into REDCap.  
St
orage of Serum  and Skin Biopsy Material  
Venous blood will be stored in lab refrigerator prior to transfer (in oncology lab) and after 
transfer (in Dr. Shiozawa’s lab). Serum and left over skin biopsy material from patients will be stored in Dr. Shiozawa’s laboratory in the Department of Cancer B iology until 
use. 
Test
s Using Serum  
Serum testing for inflammatory markers will be performed using commercially available kit that may include but not be limited to ELISA and will be performed according to the

and/or target of interest to be detected. Data resulting from these experiments may  be 
kept in laboratory notebooks or in on the data sheets provided in Appendix C.  
4.7 Follow-up 
Results of diagnostic testing will be made available in the participant's medical record. If 
unexpected abnormalities are detected, the primary oncologist will be contacted and a Neurology referral can be placed as part of the patient’s routine clinical care.  The 
patient will also be followed for 30 days to ensure the biopsy site is healing adequately.  
This follow up may be by telephone or in person.  
4.8 Data entry/ storage 
Paperwork with identifying patient information will be stored at the investigator’s workspace in the locked workroom of the Hem /Onc 1
st floor Watlington office or in the 
lab notebook of Dr. Shiozawa in his locked lab; both are located on the WFBMC campus . Electronic data will be stored on the secure personal computers of the 
investigators on the medical center campus prior to transfer into the secure RedCap online database.  
5.0 Outcome Measures  
Listed below are the primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes. However, given this is a pilot study, other parameters associated with nerve conduction and ultrasound studies will be captured and may be used for exploratory analyses and will include, but will not be limited to latency for nerve conduction studies and for ultrasound, echogenicity , vascularity , fascicle concentration, and other 
qualitative descriptions of nerve changes .

6.0 Analytic Plan  
6.1 Sample Size and Power 
6.1.1  Primary outcome:  
This current study will enroll a sample size of 22 in TIPN patients to compare  to 
historical data that was pr eviously  collected from 60 healthy patients . Using  a 
two-sided test and significance level of 0.05, we will have an 80% power to 
detect an effect size of 0.73 (unit: standard deviation [SD]) when comparing TIPN 
patients to that historical data. We have per mission to utilize  historical data 
(primary data)  collected from healthy patients  which found that  the mean and SD  
of the t ibial nerve CSA were 14.2 and 4.4 mm2, respectively  (published by 
Cartwright et al., 2008) . Assuming the same SD in TIPN patients, we  will have 
more than 80% power to detect a difference of 3.2 mm2 for the t ibial nerve.  
Based on Riazi et al. (2012),32 the mean increase in size of tibial nerve was 5.3 
when comparing subjects with diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy and control subjects. Even though the study sample is not exactly the same, with the minimal 
detectable difference equal to  3.2, we should have sufficient power for this 
analysis.  
6.1.2  Secondary outcome: 
In historical data collected from healthy patients (Cartwright et al., 2008),8 the 
mean and standard deviation (SD) of the sural nerve CSA were 5.3 and 1.8 mm2, 
respectively. Assuming the same SDs in TIPN patients, we will have more than

ower to detect a detectable difference of 1.3 mm2 for the sural nerve 
between TIPN patients and healthy patients.  
6.2 Analysis of Primary Outcome 
The distribution of the primary outcome, nerve CSA , will be transformed to satisfy 
conditional normality assumption if necessary.   It will be compared to the historical data 
from healthy patients using two -sample t -test (two-sample t -test selected as primary 
data from the historical control patients is available and will be used for analysis) .  We 
will also compare the nerve CSA  in our study sample to that in the historical diabetic 
neuropathy patients and historical oxaliplatin neuropathy patients  using one- sample t -
test.  The general linear model will be used to evaluate any factors (e.g., age) that may 
be associated with the nerve CSA. Due to the limited sample size, no more than two 
covariates will be included in the model.  
6.3 Analysis of Secondary Outcome 
The analysis of sural sensory nerve CSA will be the same as that specified for primary 
outcome. To exam ine the associations between nerve CSA  and NCS  measures , the 
self-reported neuropathy scale, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density, Spearman’s rank 
correlation coefficient will be used.  The general linear model will be also used to evaluate the association after adjusting for one or two risk factors (e.g., age). Nerve CSA will be treated as the dependent variable. NCS  measures , the self -reported 
neuropathy scale, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density are the covariates of interest.  They will be fitted in the model one at a time. 
6.4 Analyses of Exploratory Outcomes  
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient will be used to assess the associations between activated mast cells in skin biopsies, serum inflammatory markers, severity of symptoms, and primary outcome and secondary outcomes in TIPN patients.

8.0 Confidentiality and Privacy  
Con
fidentiality will be protected by collecting only information needed to assess study outcomes, 
minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify 
subjects, and maintaining all study information in a secure manner. To help ensure subject privacy and confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appear on the data collection form. Any collected patient identifying information corresponding to the unique study identifier will be maintained on a linkage file, store separately from the data. The linkage file will be kept secure, with access limited to designated study personnel. Following data collection subject identifying information will be destroyed (state the anticipated time the data will be destroyed, e.g. three years after closure of the study, and 
the method of destruction), consistent with data validation and study design, producing an 
anonymous analytical data set. Data access will be limited to study staff. Data and records will be kept locked and secured, with any computer data password protected. No reference to any individual participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise from the study.  
9.0 Data Safety and Monitoring  
Th
e principal investigator will be responsible for the overall monitoring of the data and safety of study 
participants. The principal investigator will be assisted by other members of the study staff.  
10.0 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations  
Any
 unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes 
will be promptly reported by the principal investigator or designated member of the research team to the IRB and sponsor or appropriate government agency if appropriate.  
Adv
erse events will be tracked for 30 days following skin biopsy. This time is adequate to evaluate for 
potential adverse events from this and all study procedures. Adverse events will not be tracked beyond 30 
days following the neurodiagnostic and skin biopsy procedures unless a delayed event is felt to be related to 
the study intervention.

Safety and Toxicity Review Committee  
(STRC ; previously known as CROC )  Serious 
Adverse Event ( SAE) Notification SOP    Date: 11/17/2016  
Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements 
Thi
s document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any  grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) SAEs 
on CCCWFU Institutional  interventional  trial patients . There are multiple entities that require 
reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and how it is reported.  
Ru
les used  by other e ntities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), Ad EERS, MedWatch, etc.) should 
NOT be used to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules for 
reporting described in this document should be considered.  
As defined in the NCI D ata Table 4  reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional  Interventional  
studies covered by these reporting requirements are defined as: In -house, internally reviewed 
trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorship in which the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, and monitoring of the trial, or participation in a multi -site trial initiated by an institutional investigator at another center.   
Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher here at CCCWFU. Institutional 
protocols are labeled NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research Base trials are classified as 
Institutional.  
Th
e STRC is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional Interventional studies, as 
defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials be reported to the STRC  for review. All Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPD M) 
staff members assisting a PI in documenting and reporting an SAE that qualif ies for STRC 
reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC by phone  (or in -person) , 
followed by informing the entire committee via the required email notification.  
TH
ESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any faculty or staff member on the study team 
for a CCCWFU Institutional Interventional trial. Once an event is observed, it is the responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it is reported.

Neuropathy  
Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  (WFBCCC) 
CCCWFU # 97217  
Protocol version date 03/02/18 Page 36 of 39 What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure ? 
Any unexpected grade 4  event and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention ) 
should be reported. These events should be reported if they occur while a patient is on study 
treatment or if they occur within 30 days of last study treatment (even if patient begins a new treatment during the 30 days). This window of 30 days should be the standard window to be used in all protocols unless a specific scientific rationale is presented to suggest that a shorter window can be used to identify events.  In addition, if it is not clear whether the Grade 4 is unexpected it should be reported.  
Table 1: Summary of STRC Repor ting Requirements for Institutional Pilot, Phase 1, Phase 2  
and Phase 3 Interventional Trials  
STRC reporting may not be appropriate for specific expected adverse events for protocols. In those situations the adverse events that will not require STRC repo rting must be specified in 
the text of the approved protocol.  
STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
1.Make a phone call (or speak in person)  to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as
listed below (page if necessary) —see note 2 below
2.Submit the  STRC Notification F orm WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the event. This
form is  found at either the ORIS main menu page or by going to
http://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx .
This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the event (i.e., study team
members and STRC members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of yourADVERSE EVENT

Definition of Unavailable:   
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contacted does not respond to the phone call 
or page within a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact with their backup.  Give the back -up a reasonable amount of time to respond to a phone call  or page before contacting 
another member. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a clinical research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact backup clinicians.  If the event occurs near the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC notification form.  The important criteria is that you have taken reasonable steps to notify and 
document that you have initiated some type of contact to one or more of the clinical members of STRC.  
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events as they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the information reported; there may be times when additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be made  
and further communi cation directly with the investigator may be warranted. STRC reserves the 
right to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the investigator. STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investigation.  
Is there a ny immediate danger or harm that could be present for a future patient based on the 
information provided in the STRC report – and if so an immediate suspension of enrollment 
should take place.  
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS  
If you are not able to supply all pertinent information with the initial submission, once the 
additional information is available do not submit a new report. Go to the original email that 
was received by STRC and others “reply to all” and entitle your email “ Amendment for (list date 
of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the additional 
information which you are reporting.

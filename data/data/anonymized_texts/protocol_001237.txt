Research Question and Aims  
 Hypothesis: 1. The efficacy of galv anic vestibular reduction to reduce motion sickness severity will depend on the timing 
and magnitude of the administration.  
2. The functional task performance will decline with increasing levels of galvanic vestibular reduction.  Aims, purpose, or objectives:  
Alterations in vestibular sensory processing following G-transitions lead to perceptual and motion sickness upon return to Earth’s gravity. The use of a non- pharmaceutical mitigation for motion sickness will have several 
potential advantages over drug treatment options. First, the treatment would be effective immediately and for as long as needed without having to maintain therapeutic levels in the blood- stream. Second, the treatment level 
could be customized and continuously titrated during re- adaptati on to minimize side effects while enhancing 
performance. Our project will validate a non -pharmaceutical tool using galvanic vestibular reduction (GVR) to 
better mitigate G -transitional induced motion sickness following symptom onset while customizing the 
treatment level to maximize crew performance.  
Our first specific aim is to evaluate the effect of timing and magnitude on the administration of our nonpharmaceutical treatment to motion sickness. While we have previously demonstrated that our approach can mitigate motion sickness if introduced prior to the provocative stimuli, one of the goals of this study is to determine the efficacy if we administer the treatment following the onset of symptoms. Validating the efficacy following symptom onset would alleviate the need for certifying the device to be worn within the landing suit and greatly enhance flexibility to implement this treatment during recovery operations. Our first hypothesis is that efficacy of galvanic vestibular reduction to reduce motion sickness severity will depend on the timing and magnitude of the administration. We will test this hypothesis by exposing subjects to provocative Coriolis crosscoupling stimuli on a rotating chair using a repeated measures counter-balanced design to compare motion sickness severity across three treatment interventions: prior to stimulus (symptom) onset, following symptom onset, and placebo control. The GVR amplitude will be customized based on individual sensitivity. Symptom severity will be assessed using both subjective reports and objective autonomic measures (electrogastrography and cardiac interbeat intervals). We expect that the most effective administration will be GVR delivered prior to the onset of symptoms, but that it will continue to be more effective relative to placebo control even if delivered following symptom onset.  Our second specific aim is to evaluate the effect of GVR amplitude on functional fitness task performance. One disadvantage of pharmaceutical approaches is that increased drug dosage i s often accompanied by sedative side

 effects that impact functional ability. In order to leverage our non- pharmaceutical technique that allows 
continuous adjustments in “dosage” level throughout recovery, we must map changes in GVR level with 
functional performance. Our second hypothesis is that functional task performance will decline with increasing levels of galvanic vestibular reduction. We will test this hypothesis by measuring performance on a sensorimotor and cognitive test battery in steps ranging from 0mA (control) to the level of GVR thought to provide maximal motion sickness protection. The test battery, conducted on the same subjects as specific aim 1, will include dynamic posturography as well as other cognitive and flight simulator tasks. Sensi tivity to galvanic 
stimulation will also be obtained for each subject and used to customize the GVR amplitude for the motion sickness testing in specific aim 1. The combined deliverable from both specific aims will be to validate the efficacy of GVR when c ustomizing the stimulus level and introducing it following symptom onset, and to 
understand the effects of this non- pharmaceutical approach on crew performance on functional task 
performance.  
 Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   
 The rationale of our approach rests on several key principles. First, the incidence and severity of motion sickness following G-transitions poses substantial risk to the deconditioned crew during landing and subsequent recovery operations. Second, there is a well-known relationship between bilateral vestibular loss and insusceptibility to motion sickness. Third, non-pharmaceutical approaches to motion sickness mitigation typical involve vestibular habituation or desens itization training with limited retention. Fourth, galvanic vestibular 
reduction provides a means to mitigate motion sickness following long-duration spaceflight without dependency on retention of preflight desensitization training.  Space motion sickness represents one of the greatest clinical challenges impacting crew activities during the first few days on orbit. While the inflight incidence has varied with different spacecraft, approximately 70% experience symptoms (Lackner and Dizio 2006) and one- third  experience moderate to severe symptoms 
(Reschke et al. 2016). Symptoms generally last 2-3 days inflight, although symptoms may persist in a small number of people (Baker et al. 2008). The intensity and incidence of other perceptual and sensorimotor signs and symptoms generally follow this same pattern of intersubject variability. Inflight motion sickness has been reasonably treated by limiting early crew activities and the use of intramuscular promethazine, although the sedative side effects of promethazine have been more problematic on the ground (Bagian and Ward 1994). Re-entry motion sickness has now become a greater issue following long-duration missions. Even with pharmaceutical interventions recent studies report that most, if not all crewmembers expe rience some level of symptoms following 6-month duration ISS missions 
(Reschke et al. 2017). Water landings are expected to exacerbate this problem. The incidence and severity of motion sickness has serious implications for the deconditioned crew to perfor m critical operational tasks (Wood 
et al. 2019). Of 23 participants in the field testing, only 57% were able to complete all tasks, 26% were only able to partially complete the tasks and 17% were unable to complete any tasks.  The role of vestibular input in the neural basis for motion sickness has been well established (Cohen et al. 2019). While there are many factors that contribute to interindividual differences in susceptibility (Golding 2006), it has also been known for some time that individuals with bilateral vestibular loss are insusceptible to motion sickness (Graybiel and Johnson 1963; Yates et al. 1998). Although susceptibility to other forms of terrestrial motion sickness stressors may not be predictive of G-transitional induced motion sickness ( Lackner 
and Dizio 2006), it is still reasonable to presume that suppressing vestibular function would help reduce post-

 landing motion sickness. In support of this, it has been our personal experience working with astronauts during 
our field tests and Shuttle landings that motion sickness severity is associated with hypersensitivity to head movements (Reschke et al. 2016).  Most non-pharmaceutical approaches to motion sickness mitigation involve some type of training. Cowings et al (2018) recently demonstrated improvement with autogenic feedback training, although subjects in this study were required to undergo a 2 hr refresher training prior to each provocative test. Vestibular habituation or desensitization training has been very effective in aviation, generally relying on the desensitization to one provocative motion transferring to the operational environment (Cheung and Hofer 2005). Although the success rate ranges between 50 -85%, the retention of this training in the absence of exposure has not been clea rly 
established beyond a few months (Samuel and Tal 2015). The Russian cosmonauts rely on a systematic preflight desensitization training program (Bryanov et al. 1975; Matsnev et al. 1983). While the effectiveness of this program for inflight mitigation ma y result in reduced symptoms early inflight, the incidence and severity of 
motion sickness cosmonauts experienced during our field tests clearly suggest that retention through spaceflights of six-month duration is not effective in mitigating post-landing symptoms. Several authors have noted that one consequence of the cosmonaut desensitization program is an alteration of vestibular reflexes that may be dysfunctional for operational tasking (Wetzig et al. 1993; Clement et al. 2007).  The advantage of our galvanic vestibular reduction approach over other non- pharmaceutical approaches is that 
it does not require training or have issues with retention. We have previously employed galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to reduce the sensory conflict associated with simulators, essentially providing virtual head signals to match the moving visual field, which we refer to as oculo-vestibular recoupling (Cevette et al. 2012). In exploring its use as a vestibular prosthesis, Peterka (2012) provided GVS bilateral cancel lation -type feedback 
to sway motion to remove the ability of a subject with normal vestibular function to use vestibular information for balance control. Minor and Goldberg (1991) had previously noted that galvanic anodal (inhibitory) currents, when delivered bilaterally, results in a reversible ablation of irregular afferents. Irregular afferents are important for encoding self-motion, and Oman and Cullen (2014) have speculated “sensory conflict” neurons may exist in “reafference” neural processing  associated with active motion. Galvanic vestibular reduction may therefore be 
attempted through either a cancellation -type feedback of actual motion (Peterka 2012) or by delivering bilateral 
inhibitory signals provided independent of sensing actual motion (Minor and Goldberg 1991). In our recent implementation of GVR through DoD funded work, we measured a reduction in motion sickness symptoms and changes in electrogastrography in the GVR treatment group relative to controls (Cevette et al. 2014b). In this paradigm, the subject’s only external visual cues were presented through a virtual window where both the window and subject were misaligned with the vehicle direction. The nature of this sensory conflict is similar to capsule motion during water landings where passive motion is present without stable Earth horizontal visual cues.

Study Design and Methods  
 Methods :  Describe in lay terms , completely detailing the research activities that will be conducted by Mayo 
Clinic staff under this protocol . 
 Consent: Consent forms include typical notifications of the sponsor and purpose of the study, identification of any risks in the minimal-risk protocol, discussion of privacy dimensions of the study and description of the amount and compensation structure schedule. We brief participants of their right to opt out of the study at any time and for any reason. We include consent forms in the attached draft IRB that are patterned after similar forms used in other persistent sensor wear studies the Mayo team has conducted.  Compensation: Enumeration of $300 is proposed to fairly reimburse participants for the time involved.  Protocol: Participants will attend four sessions of the experiment on four separate days. The first/initial session will be required to establ ish galvanic vestibular sensitivity measures to customize the GVR level, and to characterize 
performance on a sensorimotor-cognitive test battery as a function of GVR stimulus level. In the next three sessions, we will test the efficacy of GVR to mitigate motion sickness by comparing conditions across three separate counterbalanced sessions: administration from the onset of testing, at a midpoint of testing, and placebo control. Each session will be conducted on four separate days at least two days apart so  that there i s no 
influence on each other. Using a repeated measures design, we will compare motion sickness symptom onset, severity and recovery during standardized motion sickness testing using a rotatory chair.  Equipment: The motion sickness experiments will be conducted using our GyroStim Multi- Axis Rotating Chair 
(used in the previous IRB approved project – IRB # 19-003257) located in Aerospace Medicine and Vestibular 
Research Lab at Mayo Clinic Arizona (Figure 1A). Subjects will be restrained in a ch air but free to bend their 
head forward to elicit Coriolis cross -coupling stimuli. Subjects will b e tested with their eyes closed. Galvanic

 vestibular reduction will be delivered using a proprietary system developed at the Mayo clinic laboratory. This 
utilizes a two -channel  commercial galvanic stimulator (Good Vibrations Engineering Ltd, King City, ON; used 
in the previous IRB approved projects – IRB # 19-003257, 18-005564, 14-003906, 11-007718, 09-003815) with 
custom software. The GVR system consists of the four electrodes (two behind each ear). The stimulator can bidirectionally deliver the electrical stimulation and receive information about the amplitude  delivered 
accounting for skin impedance. In addition to motion sickness reporting, we also propose to quantify the magnitude of the motion perception during the Coriolis cross-coupling protocol using a multidimensional joystick (Figure 1B, Logitech® FreedomTM 2.4; used in the previous IRB approved projects – IRB # 19-
003257, 18-005564). Before the start of the experiment, participants will be trained to use joystick in cyclic sideways left/right,  forward/backward and twist counterclockwise/ clockwise for the perceived roll, pitch and 
yaw motions respectively. The perceived motion inputs from the joystick will be recorded by the custom 
software program named AVATAR which will also display the animation of 3D graphical human figure based on joystick inputs (Figure 1C).

 Motion sickness test paradigm: At the beginning of each motion sickness session, the rotator will be accelerated (10 deg/se c/sec) to a constant velo city up to 120 deg/sec for up to 60 sec to allow the per -rotatory  sensations to 
decay. The direction of rotation will be alternated each session and counterbalanced across subjects. Head

 movements will be cued every 10 sec, alternating between  pitch forward (chin resting on chest) and pitch 
backward (head upright). This timing allows for subjects to use the joystick to record motion perception 
associated with each pitch forward and backward movement. There will be a short pause following each set of 9 forwa rd/backward  movements (3 min) to review symptoms with the subject, although motion sickness 
symptoms will be obtained throughout the test protocol using verbal reports. Subject will continue making head movements until the motion sickness endpoint (moderate nausea) or the maximum number of paired forward/backward head movements (90) has been reached.  Galvanic Vestibular Reduction (GVR) application: We will use a repeated measures design to  compare motion 
sickness severity for each subject across the three treatment interventions: prior  to stimulus onset, following 
symptom onset, and placebo control. For each session, the participant will be instrumented for GVR prior to rotation. The amplitude (up to 2.5 mA) will be customized based on individual sensitivity (see below). The order of the three sessions will be counter-balanced across subjects. For the “ prior to” session, the GVR will be 
initiated just prior  to the chair motion. For the “ midpoint ” session, the GVR will be initiated following 4 of 10 
sets of m ovements or the onset of slight nausea, whichever occurs first. For the “ control ” session, the subject 
will be instrumented without turning on the GVR throughout the testing.  Motion sickness recordings: Objective measures of sickness will be obtained using electrogastrography (EGG) methodology that we’ve employed successfully in previous motion sickness studies (Cevette et al. 2014a) (IRB # 18-005564, 14-003906) . The EGG measurements  will require seated baseline reading for 
approximately 20 mins prior to rotation. We propose up to three alternate methods for subjective reporting (to be finalized during pilot testing). First, an acute score will be derived using the Pensacola diagnostic criteria introduced by Graybiel et al. (1968). Using this scale, the subjective intensity of eight different modalities of symptoms and signs are reported on a “slight/moderate/severe” basis, and then numerically to arrive at a weighted “malaise index”. We will also obtain a subjective magnitude estimation score using a  scale 0 -20, with 
20 indicating vomiting (Oman et al. 1986). And finally, participants will be asked to quantify motion sickness severity along multiple dimensions (e.g., gastrointestinal, central, and peripheral symptoms, Gianaros et al. 2001) using a multi- point scale for each.   
 Sensorimotor and cognitive test battery: Our second specific aim is to evaluate the effect of GVR  amplitude on 
functional fitness task performance. This aim is important to understand how crewmembers could titrate their GVR amplitude to retain motion sickness benefits while optimizing functional performance. For this aim, the same subjects participating in the motion  sickness tests will undergo the test battery while exposed to GVR in 
multiple steps ranging from 0mA (control) to the level of GVR thought to provide maximal motion sickness protection. The sensorimotor test battery will include (1) dynamic posturography, (2) Timed up and go (TUG) test (3) flight simulator  performance and (4 ) an oculo-cognitive addition test. The postur e measurements will be 
obtained using a Bertec platform with the similar protocol used  during postflight medical crew testing (Wood et 
al. 2015). Bertec Portable Essential’s dual -balance plate balance system  used for dynamic posturography is 
clinically use d in Mayo Clinic Arizona, to test balance. For this test we will use the sensory organization test 
with more reliance on the vestibular system (eyes closed on unstable surface). Similarly,  TUG test is clinically 
used in Mayo Clinic Arizona t o assess an ind ividual’s functional balance.  It requires appropriate static and 
dynamic balance system integration.  TUG provides a measure of functional balance integration not provided from standing balance tasks. The flight simulator  performance will use a Lockheed M artin developed 
Prepare3D flight simulation environment adapted to VR environment (Oculus Rift).  This entire system was 
used in the previous IRB approved project – IRB # 18-005564. It provides simulator immersion and visuomotor

 function during flight. The primary task during the flight simulation will be to fly through the “ring target”. The 
cognitive test will include Mayo’s proprietary Ocular Cognitive Addition Test (OCAT, Pradhan et al. 2019) which requires subjects to look for numbers on a screen and add these numbers together. The OCAT test includes eye-tracking to measure cognitive and oculomotor performance measures  (used in previous IRB 
approved projects – IRB # 18-005564, 18-004184, 19-004883, 16-007938) . Each test will be repeated for up to 
GVR amplitudes (including 0mA control) presented in random order. OCAT will be conducted on a 14-inch tablet with an integrated eye -tracking sensor (EyeOn – EyeTech Digital Systems) . We expect performance to 
decline with increasing GVR amplitude.  
 Galvanic ves tibular sensitivity: We will compare motion perception at different GVR amplitudes  using a similar 
rotator protocol as described above for the motion sickness testing. Motion perception will be quantified using the joystick. The GVR ampli tudes (same range as above) will be presented in random order. Assuming a 
saturation effect, we will select the lowest GVR level that reduces motion perception as the amplitude for the motion sickness testing above.  A complete experimental methodology to be conducted in this protocol is shown the tables below:

Data Analysis  
  Power analyses may not be appropriate if this is a feasibility or pilot study, but end-point analysis plans are always appropriate even if only exploratory. Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if not including all of the information.     Data Analysis Plan:  We hypothesize that efficacy of galvanic vestibular reduction to reduce motion sickness severity  will depend on 
the timing of the administration, being more effective when administered prior to  stimulus (symptom) onset. 
For specific aim 1 we will use repeated measures ANOVA to  examine changes in symptom severity, test 
duration (terminated at moderate nausea), and  recovery to baseline across three levels: prior to stimulus 
(symptom) onset, following symptom onset, and placebo control. For specific aim 2 we hypothesize that functional task performance will decline with increasing levels of galvanic vestibular reduction amplitude. We will use  repeated measures ANOVA to examine changes in cognitive performance, dynamic posturography, and 
dual tracking performance across up to 5 levels of GVR amplitude. Sample size estimates are based on: (1) the expected variability (s2) in the response parameters, (2) the alpha (a, type I) error level, or probability of incorrectly concluding the re is an effect when  responses are equivalent, (3) the magnitude of the effects to be 
detected between the means (μ1, μ2), and (4) the certainty (statistical power, 1- b) with which the effect is to be detected. Sample sizes can be calculated based on the expected standardized differences (Δ) between conditions  
(Fisher and Van Belle 1993).   Power Statement :   
Standardized mean differences of 0.75 will be considered operationally relevant effect sizes for this comparison based our previous motion sickness mitigation protocols using the oculovestibular recoupling methodology

 (Cevette et al. 2012). Based on the equation above, we will have 80% statistical power to detect standardized 
mean differences (two -sided tests) of 0.75 with an alpha error level of 0.05 with a sample of 16 subjects. A 
target of at least 30 subjects is  requested to account for incomplete data sets.  
 Endpoints Primary: Our project will deliver a non- pharmaceutical countermeasure approach using  galvanic vestibular 
reduction (GVR) that can be customized to mitigate G -transitional induced motion sickness while optimizing 
sensorimotor and cognitive performance.

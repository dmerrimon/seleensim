SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209498
Protocol Title: A Randomized Phase 3 Open Label Study of Nivolumab vs Temozolom ide Each in Combination with 
Radiation Therapy in Newly Diagnosed Adult Subjects with Unmeth ylated MGMT (tumor O-6-methylguanine DNA 
methyltransferase) Glioblastoma
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Nivolumab (BMS-936558) 240 mg IV as a 30-minute i nfusion every 2 weeks for 8 doses followed by 
nivolumab 480 mg as a 30-minute infusion every 4 weeks beginning a t Dose 9 until progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, or the study ends, whichever comes first , or Temozolomide 75 mg/m2orally daily during 
radiation therapy followed by 4 week  break then 6 (28-day) cycle s temozolomide dosed on Days 1-5 at 150 mg/m2in 
cycle 1 increasing to 200 mg/m2as tolerated up to 6 cycles. 
Study Phase: 3
Research Hypothesis: Treatment with radiation therapy plus nivolumab (RT + nivolumab ) will improve over all 
survival (OS) compared with radiation therapy plus temozolomide (RT + TMZ) in subjects w ith newly diagnosed 
unmethylated MGMT glioblastoma (GBM).
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
To compare OS of nivolumab plus radiation therapy (RT + nivolum ab) versus RT + TMZ in subjects with newly-
diagnosed GBM and unmethylated MGMT tumors after surgical resec tion.
Secondary Objectives:To compare investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS ) of RT + nivolumab versus RT + TMZ
To estimate OS rate at 24 months (OS[24]) of RT + nivolumab versus RT + TMZ (final analysis only)
To evaluate, in newly diagnosed, unmethylated MGMT GBM, any relat ionship between OS or PFS and tumor 
mutational burden (TMB) in the RT + nivolumab arm compared to th e RT + TMZ control arm
Study Design: This study will enroll subjects with newly-diagnosed GBM, following surgical resection of the tumor. After informed 
consent is obtained, subjects will enter the screening phase. T umor tissue will be evaluated for MGMT methylation 
by a central laboratory assay.  
 The screening number assigned in the 
CA209498 interactive voice response system (IVRS) will be the same subject number entered by the site to screen the subject into the CA209548 IVRS. Those with an MGMT status of me thylated or indeterminate may be eligible to 
randomize in the CA209548 study. In orde r to randomize approximately 550 eligible subjects , a total of approximately 
1200 sub jects are expected to have tum or screening, of which ap proximately 600 subjects are anticipated to have 
unmethylated MGMT tumors. 
Subjects with a central laboratory result of unmethylated MGMT may continue in the screening phase, in which 
eligibility for randomization will be documented and baseline d emographic and disease information submitted. During 
the screening phase a contrast-enhanced MRI should be obtained within 72 hours post-surgery (within 24 hours 
preferred). When ready to begin study treatment, subjects will proceed to the treatment phase of the study. All subjects who enter 
the treatment phase, ie, all randomized subjects, will be follo wed for safety and tolerability, tumor progression and 
survival. A contrast-enhanced MRI should be performed 4 weeks a fter completing radiation therapy, then every 
8 weeks ( ±7 days) until progression regardless of treatment schedule. Tum or progression will be assessed using

Radiologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria (RANO). Additi onal assessments will be performed for cognitive 
function, neurologic function, biomarkers, and patient-reported q uality of life outcomes. 
After cessation of study treatment for any reason, all randomiz ed subjects will enter a follow up phase. In the 
short-term, visits are defined for reporting of treatment-relat ed adverse events. All subjects in whom disease 
progression had not been detected at the time study treatment is stopped will be followed closely for progression with 
contrast enhanced MRI every 8 weeks ( ±7 days). After progression, subsequent treatment will be reporte d. All
randomized subjects MUST be followed for survival (primary endp oint).
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will meet regularly during th e study to ensure that subject safety is carefully 
monitored.

•Ongoing requirement for supraphysiologic steroid defined as >20 mg prednisone daily or >3 mg dexamethasone 
daily (or equivalen t), due to intracranial mass effect
•CNS hemorrhage of Grade >1 on baseline MRI scan, unless subsequ ently documented to have resolved
•Any known metastatic extracranial or leptomeningeal disease

•Known IDH mutated tumor (if available; test not required)
•Concomitant use of Gliadel ®wafer
Study Drug: includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Products (IP/IMP) and Non-investigational [Medicinal] 
Products (Non-IP/Non-IMP) as listed:
Study Drug for BMS-936558
Medication Potency IP/Non-IP 
Nivolumab Solution for Injection 100 mg (10 mg/mL) IP
Temozolomide 20 mg, 100 mg, 140 mg IP
Subjects randomized to nivolumab should begin treatment within 7 days of randomization and continue at a dose of 
240 mg given as a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle every 2 week s for 8 doses. The nivolumab 
dose will then change to 480 mg as a 30-minute IV i nfusion every 4 weeks with dose 9. Subjects will continue on 
study treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity, withd rawal of consent, or the study ends, whichever comes 
first. 
Study Assessments:
Safety Evaluation: Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for 100 da ys post-last treatment. 
Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA and reviewed for potential significance and 
importance. Adverse events will be evaluated according to the N CI CTCAE Version 4.03. Subjects should be followed 
until all treatment-related adverse events have recovered to ba seline or are deemed irreversible by the investigator.
Efficacy Assessments: Post-operative baseline MRI following con sensus recommendations must be obtained prior to 
randomization. It is strongly recommended that this scan be obta ined < 72 hrs or > 14 days post-surgery in order to 
minimize artifact. Tumor imaging assessments following recent co nsensus recommendations will occur 4 weeks 
(±7 days) after completion of radiotherapy (baseline MRI) then eve ry 8 weeks ( ±7 days) until disease progression.
Per RANO, assessment of disease progression during study requires that MRI scan be performed >12 weeks after RT; 
it is therefore recommended that second on-treatment scan be pe rformed at least 84 days after completion of RT. 
Subjects will be treated until unacceptable toxicity or disease  progression. Followi ng discontinuation of therapy, safety 
will be assessed through post-treatmen t Follow Up visits 1 and 2 (~35 and 115 days from last dose). Survival status 
will be assessed every 3 months ( ±14 days) after follow up visits are completed, and may be compl eted via telephone 
or in person visits.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: Approximately 550 subjects will be randomized to the two arms ( RT + nivolumab vs RT + TMZ) in a 
1:1 ratio, stratified by complete or partial resection at baselin e. 
This study requires at least 390 events (ie, death) to provide 90%  power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.72 with an 
overall type 1 error of 0.05 (two-sided). This translates to an observed HR of 0.82 (medi an OS of 13.0 vs 15.8 months) 
or less resulting in a statistically significant improvement. 
The secondary endpoint of only PFS will be tested hierarchically.

Endpoints: The primary endpoint is OS. OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of 
death due to any cause. A subject who has not died will be censored at the last known alive date. OS will be followed 
continuously while subjects are on study drug and every 3 months ( ±14 days) via in-person or phone contact during 
survival follow-up phase of the study.
The secondary endpoint of PFS is defined as the time from randomi zation to the date of the first documented tumor 
progression or death due to any ca use. Subjects who die without  a reported progression will be considered to have 
progressed on the date of death. Subjects who did not have dise ase progression or die will be censored at the date of 
last tumor assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study t umor assessment and did not die will be censored at 
the randomization date. Subjects who started any subsequent ant i-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression 
will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior to initiati on of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Subjects who 
had surgical resection post start of study treatment will be cen sored at the last tumor assessment date prior to initiation 
of surgical resection. PFS will be determined by investigator re ported response based on RANO criteria 
The secondary endpoint of survival rate at 24 months, is define d as Kaplan-Meier survival probability at 24 months. 
An additional secondary endpoint is OS and PFS assessed in the TMB-high population, as assessed in the TMB assay 
where the numerical cut-off for high versus low will be specifi ed in the statistical analysis plan. Definition for OS and 
PFS for this endpoint will be the same as defined earlier.
Analyses:
The analyses of primary endpoint of OS and secondary endpoints of PFS and OS[24] will be base d on all ra ndomized 
subjects. If superiority in OS is demonstrated, a hierarchical hypothesis testing approach for the secondary endpoint
of PFS will be used to preserve a study-wise type I error rate a t 0.05. OS[24] will be estimated using Kaplan Meier 
method. OS and PFS will also be estimated for the TMB-high popul ation.
OS and PFS distribution in all randomized subjects will be comp ared between treatment groups using a two-sided 
stratified log-rank test. The hazard ratio (HR) and correspondi ng two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be 
estimated in a Cox pr oportional hazard model using treatment as  a single covariate stratified by complete or partial 
resection at baseline.
OS and PFS curves will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier prod uct-limit method. Median OS and PFS along with 
the corresponding two-sided 95% CIs using the log-log transform ation will be computed. 
OS [24] and the corres ponding 95% CIs using the log-log transfo rmation w ill be computed after all subjects have 
follow-up of at least 24 months. OS and PFS in the TMB-high popu lation will be estimated usi ng the Kaplan-Meier 
method.

2 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
2.1
Good Clinical Practice
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical P ractice (GCP), as defined by the  
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and in accordan ce with the ethical principles  
underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50) and applicable local requirements.
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 15-Nov-2017 29
6.0 Approved 930095264 6.0v

Clinical Protocol CA209498
BMS-936558 nivolumab
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. Th e protocol and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent w ill receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC), approval/favorable opinion prior to initia tion of the study.
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Sponsor or designee immediately. A serious 
breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in c onnection with the study or the 
protocol, which is lik ely to affect, to a significant degree, t he safety or physical or mental integrity 
of the subjects of the study or the scientific value of the stud y.
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.
This study will not use the services of study personnel where s anctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medic al licensure, debarment).
2.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and  dated approval/favorable opinion 
from the IRB/IEC, for the protocol, consent form, subject recru itment materials 
(eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be pr ovided to subjects. The investigator 
or BMS should also provide  the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Invest igator Brochure or product 
labeling information to be provided to subjects and any updates .
The investigator, Sponsor or desi gnee shoul d provide the IRB/IEC w ith reports, updates and other 
information (eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and admin istrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures.
2.3 Informed Consent
Investigators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully i nformed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regardi ng clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about th e purpose, potential risks, and other
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject  volunteers to participate.
Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an approp riate (ie, Global or Local) sample 
informed consent form w hich will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:1) Provide a copy of the consent form and written information ab out the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study pa rticipation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood
2) Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally accepta ble representative to inquire about 
the details of the study
3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the i nformed consent discussion

BMS-936558 nivolumab
4) Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of th e written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information
5) If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally  acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of makin g and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the subject
6) Revise the informed consent whenever important new informatio n becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a perso n designated by the investigator, 
should fully i nform the sub ject or the subject' s legally accept able representative or legal 
g u a r d i a n ,  o f  a l l  p e r ti n e n t  a s p e c t s  o f  t h e  s t u d y  a n d  o f  a n y  n e w  information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records.Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or su bjects with or severe dementia), may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally-acc eptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study to the exte nt compatible with his or her
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or sh e should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The exp licit wish of a subject who is unable t o give his or 
her written consent, but is capable of forming an opinion and ass essing information, to refuse 
participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time s hould be considered by 
the investigator.The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This study will e nroll subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), followi ng surgical 
resection of the tumor. After informed consent is obtained, sub jects will enter the screening phase . 
Tumor tissue will be evaluated for MGMT methylation by a centra l laboratory assay.

Pos
t-operative baseline MRI following consensus recommendations ,52must be obtained pri or to 
randomization. It i s strongly recommended that this scan be obt ained < 72 hrs or > 14 days  
post-surgery in order to minimize artif act. There is no require ment that this baseline scan be  
performed on a “qualif ied” machine (a qualified MRI is one that m eets the Imaging Manual  
specifications and has been validated with the required phantom  scan). If a post-operative MRI is  
not available, a high-quality, contrast-enhanced CT scan may be performed initially, but in this  
case a contrast-enhanced MRI must  be performed prior to randomiz ation (> 2 weeks post-op  
preferred).
Subjects with a central laboratory result of unmethylated MGMT may continue in the screening  
phase, in which eligibility f or randomization will be documented and bas eline demographic and  
disease informati on submitted; f or details, see Section 3.1.1.
When ready to begin study treatment, s ubjects will proceed to t he treatment phase of the study;  
for details, see section 3.1.2 . All subjects who enter the treatment phase, ie, all ra ndomized  
subjects, w ill be followed for safety and tolerability, tumor p rogression and survival. A  
contrast-enhanced MRI should be performed 4 weeks ( ±7 days) after completing radiation  
therapy, then every 8 weeks ( ±7 days) until progression regardless  of treatment schedule or do se 
delays. Tumor progression will be assessed using RANO criteria described in Section 5.4.2 . 
Additional assessments will be performed for cognitive function , neurologic function, biomarkers
and patient-reported qu ality of life outcomes.
After cessation of study treatment for any reason, all ra ndomized subjects w ill enter a follow up  
phase. In the short-term , visits are defined for reporting of treatment-r elated AEs. All subjects in  
whom disease progression had not b een detected at the time stud y treatment is stopped w ill be  
followed closely for progression with contrast enhanced MRI ever y 8 weeks ( ±7 days) until  
progression. After progression, subjects MUST be followed for sur vival (primary e ndpoint);  
subsequent treatments will be reported. For det ails on the fol
low-up phase, see section 3.1.3 .
Baseline and all subsequent scans will be submitted to a blinded  independent radiology review  
committee (BIRC) for archiving, once the subject is randomized and throughout the study period.
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will meet regularly during th e study to ensure that subject  
safety is carefully monitored, see Section 7 .
The study design schematic is presented in Figure 3.1-1 .

3.1.1 Screening Phase
Subjects will provide consent for enrollment and tumor submissi on in the peri-operative period, 
so that MGMT status can be determined.  Consent for randomizati on and study treatment may be 
deferred until MGMT unmethylated status and eligibility is esta blished (or be obtained 
concurrently). However, consent for tumor submission only may b e obtained pre-operatively based 
on a clinical/radiographic diagnosis of GBM. The clinical circu mstances should be considered 
with respect to the timing of consent.

Figure 3.1.1-1: Screening and Randomization
Following informed consent, subjects with histologic diagnosis of GBM and no evident exclusions 
will be enrolled via a call to an IVRS system, in order to obtain  a subject number, after which 
tumor tissue will be submitted to the central laboratory. For d etails, see Table 5.1-1 .
A centralized tumor tissue assay for MGMT is required for randomi zation. Therefore, the tumor 
sample should be submitted as soon as possible.
Eligibility will be established and baseline information submitted for subjects with a central 
laboratory result of unmethylated MGMT. A subject cannot be randomized until the result of the central laboratory MGMT is entered into the IVRS. Subjects without  a confirmed result of
unmethylated MGMT will be considered screen failures and will n ot be eligible for randomization. 
If the assay result is methylated or indeterminate MGMT, they m ay be enrolled onto another BMS 
study (if available) based on the same MGMT assay.
It is expected that corticosteroid therapy w ill be tapered to the maximum extent possible during 
this phase. Subjects who cannot tolerate tapering of steroids t o < 20 mg prednisone or < 3 mg 
dexamethasone per day (or equivalent) are not eligible for rando mization.
RT should begin within 42 days of surgi cal resection, but may be delayed if clinically required. 
Typically, the time from screening procedure to treatment should no t exceed 28 days, but may be 
longer if clinically indicated. If repeat resection to improve tumor control is performed for newly-
diagnosed GBM prior to any other therapy (eg, upon referral to r esearch site), the 42-day interval 
should restar t at the time of this second surgery and a new pos t-operative MRI must be performed.Schema: Screening and Randomization

3.1.2 Treatment Phase
3.1.2.1 Randomization and Initiation of TreatmentAfter eligibility has been confirmed, subjects who are clinical ly ready to begin study treatment (ie, 
recovered from surgery) will proceed to the treatment phase of the study via a second call into the  
IVRS system. At this call, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive radiotherapy plus nivolumab  
(RT + nivolumab) or ra diotherapy plus temozolomide (RT + TMZ).
Randomization will be prospectively balanced (ie, stratified) a ccording to post-operative MRI  
finding of “complete” versus “partial” resection. For the purposes  of this study, a complete  
resection will be defined as ≤5 mm of contrast enhancement on T1 images of the post tumor  
surgical region following surgical resection. A partial resecti on is defined as ≥10 mm of residual
contrast-enhancing tumor tissue on T1 images following surgical  resection. Resections with a  
residual of between > 5 and < 10 mm of enhancement will be defined as partial or complete by the  
investigator’s best clinical judgment.
The total time elapsed from diagnostic surge ry to initiation of RT s hould not ex ceed 42 days,
including a maximum of 7 days fro m randomization to initiation o f RT; however, treatment may  
be delayed if clinically required. Subjects in the RT + nivoluma b arm should begin nivolumab  
within 7 days after randomization, and may be given at any time pr ior to RT start, as clinically  
appropriate. Subjects randomized to the RT + TMZ arm will begin combination  
chemoradiotherapy on the same day, within 7 days after randomizat ion, as clinically appropriate.
See sections 4.5.1 and4.5.2 for details of dosing for nivolumab and temozolomide; for an ov erview 
of the treatment phase, see Section 3.1.2.
3.1.2.2 Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy s hould begin after substantial recovery from surg ical res ection, preferably not  
more than 42 days after surgery; however, treatment may be delayed  if clinically required.  
External-beam RT to a total dose of 60 Gy will be administered in daily doses of  2 Gy, typ ically  
on a 5 days on / 2 days off schedule as appropriate for scheduli ng, over 6-7 weeks. Patients  
considered clinically inappropriate for full dose RT (60 Gy ±5%) are not eligible, eg, due to older  
age, tumor location. RT is administered to the post-operative t umor volume plus a 2-3 cm margin,  
as directed by a radiation oncologist.
Radiation therapy planning and administration s hould follow currently-accepted guidelines.
53
Additional details are provided in Appendix 2 . RT may be administered at a facility more  
convenient to the pati ent, but approval from S ponsor or designee mu st be obtained if not part of  
the same practice group as the investigative study site. For AEs  related to RT, see section 6 .
Note: Suspected progression occurri ng within or during 12 weeks  a f t e r  R T  m a y  b e  
“pseudoprogression ”; in this setting, suspected progression sho uld be confirmed prior to  
discontinuation of treatment. B MS Medical Monitor should be cons ulted.

3.1.3 Follow-up Phases
The follow-up phase begins when the decision is made to discont inue a subject from study 
treatment, including for AEs, for maximum clinical benefit (inv estigator decision), for subject  
request, for completion of TMZ maintenance therapy (6 cycles), d isease progression, or another  
reason.
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs with visits at 35 days ( ±7 days) and 115 days ( ±7d a y s )a f t e r  
last dose; for details, see Table 5.1-3 and Section 6 . All AEs must be documented for a minimum  
of 100 days after disc ontinuation, but drug-r elated toxicities s hould continue to be followed until  
they resolve, return to baseline or are deemed irreversible.
 
 
 
 
3.1.4 Overall Study Duration
The start of the trial is defined as first visit for first subject screened. End of trial is defined as last  
visit or scheduled procedure shown in Time and Events schedule for the last subject. Study  
completion is defined as the final date on which data for the p rimary endpoint was or is expected  
to be collected, if this is not the same.
Enrollment and rando mization of 550 subjects is expected to require approximately 10 months.  
Final analysis is planned after at least 390 deaths have been rep orted. Depending on assumptions,  
this analysis is anticipated to occur at approximately 33 months  after first subject is randomized,  
respectively; see Statistical Considerations, section 8 for details.
Data may be collected up to 12 months after the pivotal analysis  has occurred, after which the  
study may be closed. At discretion of the Sponsor, survival data  may continue to be collected for  
up to 5 years.
3.2 Post Study Access to Therapy
At the conclusion of the study, subjects who continue to demons trate clinical benefit will be  
eligible to receive BMS supplied study drug. Study drug will be  supplied via an extension of the  
study, a rollover study requiring approval by responsible healt h authority and ethics committee or  
through another mechanism at the discretion of BMS. BMS reserves the right to terminate access  
to BMS supplied study drug if any of the following occur: a) the ma rketing application is rejected  
by responsible h ealth aut hority; b) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; c) the  subject 
can obtain medication from a government sponsored or private he alth program; or d) therapeutic 
alternatives become available in the local market.

females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle st imulating hormone, (FSH) level > 
40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
*Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT)  are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their judgment 
in checking serum FSH levels. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products

Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH  
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered  
postmenopausal.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
It is expected that enrolled subjects w ill have systemic corticosteroids tapered as quickly as  
clinically appropriate during screening phase, and discontinued if possible prior to randomization.  
Supportive care for all disease-related or tr eatment-related AEs should be max imized for all  
subjects on this study. See Section 4.5.2.4 for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis pneumonia.
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted TreatmentsConcurrent anti-neoplastic therapy, including other chemotherap y, immunotherapy, additional  
radiation therapy or investigational agents for treatment of GB M are prohibited during the  
treatment phase. Use of any additional noninvasive medical device treatment of GBM 
(eg, novoTTF, Optune ©) is prohibited. The following medications are prohibited during  the study 
treatment (unless utilized to treat a drug related AE):
•Immunosuppressive agents 
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 3.4.3 )  
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Subjects with a coexisiting condition requiring systemic treatmen t with either corticosteroids  
(> 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressiv e medications (including  
within 14 days of randomization) are excluded. Subjects continu ing to require s upraphysiologic  
steroids (prednisone > 20 mg d aily or > 3 mg dexame thasone per day or equivalent) for increased  
intracranial pressure may not be randomized. Inhaled or topical  steroids, and adrenal replacement  
steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent, are permit ted in the absence of active  
autoimmune disease.
Study-related MRI imaging of the brain will be performed using c ontrast materials. Subjects with  
severe renal insufficiency, who should not receive contrast mat erials (eg, estimated glomerular  
filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m
2) are excluded. 
Certain surgically-implanted devices (pacemaker, deep brain sti mulator, met allic implants, etc.)  
are incompatible with MRI imaging. The local imaging facility a nd investigator should determine  
the appropriate precautions or guid elines that should be instituted for subjects with tattoos, bod y 
piercings or other body art. For ot her locally performed imaging , it is the local imaging facility’s  
responsibility to determine, based on subject attributes (eg, a llergy history, diabetic history and  
renal status, other contr aindications), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast regimen for  
each subject. The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an indivi dual subject in this study rests with  
the site radiologist, the investigator, and the standard set by the local Ethics Co mmit tee.
In accordance with TMZ labeling, valproic acid should not be us ed concomitant with TMZ; at  
investigator discretion, alternative anticonvulsants should be used.

3.4.3 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articu lar, intranasal, and inhalational  
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal rep lacement steroid doses > 10 mg  
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) cou rse of corticosteroids for  
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for tr eatment of non-au toimmune conditions (eg, delayed-
type hypersensitivi ty reaction cau sed by a contact allergen) is permitted.
Steroid use should be  minimized prior to ra ndomization. Systemic corticosteroid use or  
physiologic rep lacement doses of steroids are permitted, even if > 20 mg/day pr ednisone 
equivalents, for:  a) treatment-r elated AEs b) symptoms  related to GBM, incl uding suspected tumor 
flare or pseudoprogression, or c) treatment of non-autoimmune co nditions (eg, prophylaxis for  
contrast dye allergy, contact hypersen sitivity). Details regard ing corticosteroid use prior to and  
during the study w ill be co llected (name of medication, doses utilized, start and stop dat es, 
frequency of use, route of administration). Information regardi ng concomitant corticosteroid use  
may be analyzed with regard to study outcome measures.
Subjects requiring chronic treatment with corticosteroids may b e treated with his tamine-2-receptor  
antagonists or proton pump inhibitors as prophylaxis for potent ial gastrointestinal adverse  
reactions (ulceration, perforation, hemorrhage) unless otherwis e contraindicated.
Concomitant medications are recorded at baseline and throughout  the treatment phase of the study  
in the appropriate section of the CRF. All medications (prescri ptions or over the counter  
medications) continued at the start of the study  or started during the study and different from the  
study drug must be documented in the concomitant therapy s ection of the  CRF.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Stud y Drug
Subjects MUST discontinue invest igational product (and non-inve stigational product at the  
discretion of the investigator) for a ny of the following reasons:
•Disease progression, except as described in Section 4.5.1.6
•Unacceptable toxicity requiring discontinuation of TMZ or nivol umab, see Sections 4.5.1.5
and 4.5.2.3
•Maximum clinical benefit, as determined by investigator
•Any clinical AE, laboratory a bnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the  
investigator, indicates that continued participation in the stu dy is not in the best interest of the  
subject, see Sections 4.5.1.5 and 4.5.2.3
•Subject’s request to stop study treatment (other than for an AE)
•Completion of 6 cycles of maintenance TMZ (for exception see Table 4.5-1 )
•Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent thro ugh impris onment or involunt arily incarceration  
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectio us disease) illness
•Initiation of ant ineoplastic therapy other than as rando mized

This is a survival study, therefore subjects discontinuing study  treatment will remain on study for 
documentation of progression and death.
In case of pregnancy, the investigator must immedi ately notify the Sponsor or designee of this 
event. In most cases, study drug w ill be permanently discontinue d in an appropriate ma nner. Please 
call the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of awareness of th e pregnancy. If the investigator 
determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrant s re-initiation of study drug, after 
termination of the pregnancy and if allowed by local regulations, a discussion between the 
investigator and the Sponsor or designee must occur.All subjects who discontinue study drug should comply with prot ocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5 . The only exception to this requirement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent fr eely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily i ncarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric  or physical illness).
If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion  of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.3.6 Post Study Drug Follow up
In this study, OS is the primary endpoint of the study . Post treatment follow-up is thus of critical 
importance and is essential to preserving subject safety a nd the integrity of the st udy. Subjects who 
discontinue study drug must continue to be followed for collecti on of outcome and/or survival 
follow-up data as required and in line with Table 5.1-3 until d eath or the conclusion of the study.
Subjects who discontinue study drug will continue to be followed.
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all treated/ randomized subjects outside of the 
3m o n t h  ( ±14 days) specified visit schedule. At the time of this request,  each s ubject w ill be 
contacted to determine their survival status unless the subject  has withdrawn consent for all 
contact.3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study drug w ill remain in the study and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him /her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this infor mation. Subjects sho uld notify the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , if possible. The withdrawal of 
consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the 
withdrawal is from further treatment with study drug only or al so from study procedures and/or 
post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital 
status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information 
should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local 
law.

3.6.2 Lost to Follow-Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to deter mine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up with pe rsons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow-up 
is defined by the inability t o reach the subject after a minimu m of three documented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of respons e by subject t o one registered ma il letter. A ll attempts 
should be  documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is  determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist in the follow- up portion of the study has 
been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the inves tigator may use a Sponsor-retained 
third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact  information or other 
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up po rtion of the study. The site staff and 
representative will consult publicly available sources, such as  public health registries and 
databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If af ter all attempts, the subject remains 
lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator s hould be 
reported and documented in the  subject’s medical records.

4.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, als o known as investigational medic inal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference 
in a clinical study, including products already with a marketin g authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authoriz ed form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further informati on about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed o nly from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. Although no t a medicinal product, Radiation 
Therapy is also considered part of study treatment.
In this protocol, investigational products are:
•BMS-936558 (nivolumab)
•Temozolomide
4.2 Non-Investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medicati on for preventative,  diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diag nosis, may be considered as non-
investigational products.
See Section 4.5 for details regarding st udy drug dosi ng in combination with RT.
4.3 Storage of Study Drug
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug i s stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, the  study drug should not be dispensed
and contact BM S immediately.
Study drug not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance wit h the package insert.
Please refer to Section 9.2.2 for guidance on IP records and documentation.
Infusion-related supplies (e g, IV bags, in-line filters (0.2-1.2 micron), 0.9% NaCl or 5% Dextrose 
solution) will not be supplied by the sponsor and should be purc hased locally if permitted by local 
regulations.

4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
After informed consent has been obtained, the subject must be e nrolled into the study by calling 
an IVRS to obtain the subject number. Every subject that signs the informed consent form must be 
assigned a subject number in IVRS. The investigator or designee  will register the subject for 
enrollment by following the enrollment procedures established by BMS. The following information is required for enrollment:
•Date that informed consent was obtained
•Date of birth of subject
•Gender (at birth) of subject
CA209498 is a randomized study. Central lab confirmati on of MGMT un- methylated status must 
be received pri or to the IVRS ra ndomization call. Once enrolled in IVRS, enrolled subjects who
meet all eligibility criteria, and are clinically ready to begin  treatment, will be randomized through 
the IVRS. The following information is required for randomizati on:
•Subject number
•Date of birth of subject
•Extent of tumor resection: Complete or Partial
Subjects meeting all eligibility c riteria will be randomized in  a 1:1 ratio to receive radiotherapy + 
nivolumab (RT+ nivol umab) or radiotherapy +  temozolomide (RT + TMZ). MGMT methylation 
status will be transferred from the testing laboratory to the I VRS database.
The exact procedures for using the IVRS will be detailed in the IVRS manual.
4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Dosing schedules for both arms are detailed in Table 4.5-1 . All subjects w ill undergo surgical 
resection and radiotherapy as outlined in Sections 3.1. For the RT + nivolumab arm, the first dose 
of nivolumab is to be administered within 7 days of randomization . For the RT + TMZ arm, the 
first dose of temozolomide is to be administered at the beginnin g of radiotherapy. Treatment details

4.5.1 Nivolumab Dosing
4.5.1.1 Nivolumab Dose and ScheduleSubjects randomized to nivolumab s hould begin tr eatment within 7 days of randomization, but RT  
should begin within 42 days after definitive resection, but may be delayed if clinically required.
Subjects will continue on study tr eatment un til progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, or the study ends, whichever comes first. 
Subjects randomized to the RT + nivolumab arm will begin nivolu mab at a dose of 240 mg, given 
as a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each tr eatment cy cle Q2W for 8 doses. The nivolumab 
dose will then change to 480 mg as a 30-minute IV infusion Q4W w ith dose 9 (starti ng wee k 17, 
in the absence of delays). Nivolumab injection can be infused un diluted or diluted so as not to  
exceed a total infusion volume of 120 mL. Nivolumab infusion mus t be promptly followed by a  
saline flush to clear the line.
Continuation of nivolumab t reatment with suspected progression is permitted, see Section 4.5.1.6 . 
Treatment will continue until discontinuation from study tr eatment for any of the criteria listed in  
sections 3.5 or4.5.1.5 .
There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab al lowed. Subjects may be dosed no  
less than 12 days from the previous dose during Q2W cycles. A d ose given more than 3 days after  
the intended dose will be considered a delay. For Q4W dosing cy cles, subjects may be dosed within  
a ±3 day window. Premedications are not recommended for the first do se of nivolumab.

Subjects should be monitored for i nfusion reactions during nivo lumab administration. If an acute  
reaction is noted, subjects should be managed according to Section 4.5.1.8 .
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed or discontinued depending on how well the  
subject tolerates treatment. Dosing visits are not skipped, only  delayed. Nivo lumab should be  
delayed (see Section 4.5.1.3) for toxicities considered at least possibl y-related to nivolumab.
Nivolumab interruption refers to stopping the i nfusion, eg, for an infusion r eaction (see

4.5.1.3 Dose Delay Criteria for Nivolumab
Tumor assessments should continue per protocol schedule, even i f dosing is delayed.
Nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following:
•Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related AE, with the excepti on of fatigue
•Grade 2 drug-related creatinine, AST, ALT, and/or total bilirub in abnormalities
•Grade 3 skin drug-related AE
•Grade 3 drug-related la boratory abnormality with the following exceptions:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase does not r equire dose delay
−Grade ≥3 ALT/AST or total bilirubin will require dose discontinuation (see 
Section 4.5.1.5 )
•Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the  
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.
Subjects who require delay of nivolumab should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently if  
clinically ind icated. Nivolumab dosing can be resumed on the es tablished dosing schedule (q2 or  
q4 weeks) when retreatment criteria are met (Section 4.5.1.4).
4.5.1.4 Criteria to Resume Dosing for Nivolumab
Subjects may resume treatment with study drug when the drug-related AE(s) resolve to Grade ≤1 
or baseline value, with the following exceptions:
•Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue
•Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-r elated skin AE may r esume treatment in  
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity

•For subjects with Grade 2 AST, ALT, and/or total bilirubin abnormalities, dosing may resume 
when laboratory values return to baseline and management with corticosteroids, if needed, is  
complete.
•Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND tota l bilirubin valu es meeting  
discontinuation parameters (Section 4.5.1.5 ) should have treatment permanently discontinued.  
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, dia rrhea or colitis must have resolved to baseline before  
treatment is resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumoni tis after completion of a  
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreat ment if discussed with and 
approved by BMS Medical Monitor (or designee).
•Subjects with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled  with only physiologic  
hormone rep lacement may resume treatment after consultation with the BMS Me dical Monitor
(or designee). Adrenal insufficiency  requires discontinuation re gardless of control with  
hormone replacement.
4.5.1.5 Treatment Discontinuation Criteria for Nivolumab
Nivolumab treatment should be permanently discontinued for the following: 
•Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis, eye pain or blurred vision tha t does not respond to topical  
therapy and does not improve to Gr ade 1 severity within the re- treatment period OR requires  
systemic treatment.
•Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related AE lasting > 7 days or recurs,  with the following  
exceptions for laboratory abnormalities, drug-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm,  
neurological toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion reactions, and endocrinopathies:
−Grade 3 drug-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, neurol ogical toxicity,  
hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration  requires discontinuation
−Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled wit h only physiologic  
hormone replacement do not require discontinuation. Adrenal ins ufficiency requires  
discontinuation regardless of c ontrol with hormone replacement.
−Grade 3 drug-related laboratory a bnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation  
except:♦Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated wi th bleeding requires  
discontinuation
♦Grade ≥3 drug-related AST, ALT, or total bilirubin requires discontinua tion*
*In most cases of Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation, study drug(s) w ill be permanently

allowed. 
−Dosing delays lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose that occ ur for non-drug-related 
reasons may be allowed, if approved by the BMS Medical Monitor (or designee). 
−Prior to re-initiating treatment in a subject with a dosing del ay lasting > 6 weeks, the BMS 
medical monitor (or designee) must be consulted. Tumor assessme nts should continue as 
per protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety and laboratory 
studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays.

Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subje ct with continued nivolumab dosing.
4.5.1.6 Continuing Nivolumab with Suspected Progression
Accumulating evidence indicates that a minority of subjects tre ated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despite init ial evidence of disease progression, eg, due to inflammatory 
reaction simulating progression (“tumor flare” or pseudoprogres sion). Subjects on the RT + 
nivolumab arm may, at investigator discretion, continue nivoluma b in the setting of suspected 
progression until progression is confirmed. [Note: this is not the same as confirmation of 
progression occurring within 12 weeks after RT, which applies t o both treatment arms.] 
Communication with the BMS Medical Monitor is strongly encouraged. If the investigator 
believes that the subject continues to derive clinical benefit by continuing treatment, the subject 
should continue assessments according to Table 5.1-2 .
Subjects may continue nivolumab beyond initial (susp ected) progression only if they meet the 
following criteria:
•Subject is toler ating nivolumab

•Treatment will not delay intervention to prevent imminent compl ications, eg surgery for relief 
of symptomatic intracranial mass effect 
•Investigator-assessed overall clinical benefit
Radiographic assessment should be rep eated after suspected progress ion as clinically required in 
order to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tum or size  or continued progression. 
If possible, perfusion images s hould also be obtained. All MRI scans should be submi tted to the 
imaging vendor as soon as possible. 
Re-operation should be considered, if lesion is surgically acce ssible, to differentiate immune-
treatment effects from progression. The BMS Medical Monitor sho uld be consulted. Potential for 
clinical benefit s hould be b alanced by clinical j udgment as to whether the sub ject is clinically 
deteriorati ng and unlikely to receive benefit from continued treatment wit h nivolumab. Nivolumab 
treatment should be discontinued permanently upon confirmation of RANO-assessed progression 
but prolonged observation (eg, 3 months) may be required, as su ggested in Okada et al.40
4.5.1.7 Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can d iffer in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is cons idered an immuno-oncology agent 
in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs assoc iated with immuno oncology 
agents may mitigate severe toxici ty. Management Algorithms have  been developed to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathy
•Skin
•Neurological
The above algorithms are found in Appendix 1 and in the nivolumab Investigator Brochure.
4.5.1.8 Treatment of Nivolumab-Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequ ences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infus ion or hypers ensitivit y reactions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headach e, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, 
hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic-like  reactions. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusion reactions s hould be reported wit hin 24 hours to the st udy medical monitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the criter ia. Infusion reactions should b e graded according to NCI CTCAE 
(Version 4.03) guidelines.

Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; infus ion inte rruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympt oms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are r ecommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg  at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy or infusion inter ruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophy lactic medications indicated for ≤24 
hours):•Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal sal ine, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution o f symptoms. Corticosteroid 
and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appro priate. If the infusion is 
interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, th e rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symp toms recur, then no further BMS-
936558 will be administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equi valent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab inf usions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up t o 25 mg of Sol uCortef or equivalent) may be  used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grade 3: prol onged [ie, not rapidly  responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improv ement; hospi talization ind icated for other clinical sequelae (eg, renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates). Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor or v entilatory support indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infu sion of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epinep hrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1000 
solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution injected 
slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV w ith methylprednisolone 100 
mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored u ntil the Investigator is 
comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be  permanently discontinued. 
Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the sym ptoms.

4.5.2 Temozolomide Dosing
4.5.2.1 Temozolomide Dose and Schedule
Subjects on RT + TMZ will be administered temozolomide (TMZ, Temodar®) daily during RT  
and as maintenance therapy for 6 cycles. TMZ dosing will be perf ormed according to institutional  
standard; the following guidance is drawn from published litera ture. 
Temozolomide (TMZ) will be dosed at 75 mg/m2once per day continuously throughout RT,  
typically for 42 days and with a maximum of 49 days. See Table 4.5.2.3-1 for dose modifications  
during concomitant RT + TMZ dosing. After completion of RT, ther e will be a 4-week break.  
Subjects will receive 6 cycles of temozolomide daily x 5 days e very 28 days. 
Table 4.5.2.1-1: Dose Levels for TMZ Maintenance Monotherapy
Dose Level TMZ Dose in mg/m2/day Notes
-1 100 mg/m2/day Reduction for prior toxicity
0 150 mg/m2/day Dose during Cycle 1
1 200 mg/m2/day Dose during C2-6 in absence of TMZ-related toxicity
Source: adapted from Temodar ®package insert (PI)
In the first maintenance cycle TMZ is given at a dose of 150 mg /m2, and then increased to  
200 mg/m2in cycle 2 as follo ws: If, during the first cycle, all non-hema tologic AEs observed were 
grade ≤2 (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting) and with platelets ≥100 x 109/L and ANC ≥1.5 
x109/L, then the temozolomide dose should be escalated to dose leve l 1 and this dose should be
used as the starting dose for subsequent cycles. Doses of TMZ ar e not precise but are adjusted  
based on tolerance; rounding of up to 10% is entirely acceptable.  
If treatment after cycle 1 has to be delayed because of ongoing non-hematologic AEs of grade ≥2, 
then no escalation is possible. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, then the dose should not be  
escalated in further cycles based on AEs (see Table 4.5.2.3-2 ). If there was a prior dose reduction 
during the concomitant period with  RT, then dose -1 should be t he starting dose for subsequent  
cycles. Table 4.5.2.1-1 describes dose levels during temozolomide m onotherapy.
4.5.2.2 Criteria to Start Temozolomide Maintenance Cycles 
Maintenance treatment begins f ollowing a 4 week treatment break  after RT. TMZ treatment may  
begin if blood count (obtained within the pri or 3 days) shows ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L, platelet c ount 
≥100 x 109/L and any Grade ≥3 non-hematologic AE (except alopecia) must have resolved to  
grade≤1). If AEs persist, treatment should be delayed by 1 week for up  to 4 consecutive weeks.

Antiemetic prophylaxis with metoclopramide or a 5-hydroxytrypta mine 3 antagonist is allowed  
prior to treatment with temozolomide.
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
Not applicable.
4.7 Treatment Compliance
Assessment of study medications w ill be performed at each study visit. For subjects receiving  
temozolomide, the subject should be instructed to bring all unuse d study drug to each visit as well  
as any empty containers. The dates and number of capsules dispe nsed and returned must be  
recorded on the drug accountability form maintained on-site. Un used or partially used study drug  
are returned to the subject and dosi ng should continue from the in-use container until it has been  
emptied. Subjects will be instructed to record dosing in a dosi ng diary which will be reviewed at  
each visit, in combination with drug accountability to confirm t reatment compliance. Sites should 
discuss discrepancies between the diary and the drug log to rec oncile actual dosing with the patient  
at each visit.

available at study enrollment, a high-quality contrast-enhanced CT scan may be used; in this case,  
a MRI must be performed prior to randomization (> 2 weeks post- op preferred). Additional MRI  
scan may be obtained if clinically appropriate, eg for radiothe rapy planning, but is not required; in  
this case the last scan prior to randomization will be consider ed the baseline MRI.

Subjects who are 
unable (due t o existent med ical c ondition, ie,  pacemaker or ICD device) or  
unwilling to have a brain MRI at baseline are excluded from the study. Subjects who become  
unable to undergo MRI imaging after randomization may continue in the study for assessment of  
OS as long as there is no safety issue which would require monitoring by MRI. 
Study sites will retain local access to the imaging results for  safety and efficacy reading purposes. 
The study investigator will review the local MRI results as clinically appropriate to ensure that any  
potentially emergent clinical situations are addressed in a tim ely fashion. Clinically significant  
radiologic findings or changes from baseline scans will be code d as AEs or serious adverse events  
according to the criteria described below in Section 6 . Additional radiographic findings of potential

5.4.1 Suspected Progression
In order to distinguish potential tr eatment eff ects (or “pseudoprogression”) from progressive 
disease and thus to minimize premature discontinuation of nivol umab or temozolomide, subjects  
who initially meet radiologic criteria for disease progression,  but are tolerating study drug, may
continue receiving study drug until confirmation of progression  with an MRI performed  
approximately 8 weeks later. If possible, MRI perfusion images s hould also be obtained. If a  
determination cannot be made after an 8 week interval, then tre atment may continue until either  
progression is confirmed or regression is observed, consistent w ith either pseudoprogression or

immune-treatment effect. Consu ltation with the BMS Medical Moni tor is recommended but not  
required.
Confirmation of progression is mandatory if recurrence occurs w ithin 12 weeks of completion of  
RT. Suspected disease progression wi thin 12 weeks after the end  of RT must be confirmed by  
subsequent MRI performed within 8 weeks after the initial radio logical assessment of progression.  
Prior to 12 weeks after RT, progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if the re is 
new enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high -dose region or 80% isodose line)  
or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopat hologic sampling.39Note: in the  
absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of progressi on, clinical decline alone is not  
sufficient for definition of progressive disease. If the follow-up assessment confirms that progression has occur red, the date of progression will  
be the date at which progression was first determined. If the follow-up assessment does not confirm  
progression, then the original time point response will be asse ssed as SD.

5.6.1 Tumor Samples
Tumor specimens will be obtained  from consenting subjects prior  to treatment to characterize  
immune cell populations and expression of selected tumor marker s. Tumor tissue (block or slides)  
must be available for submission prior to randomization. If a bl ock is not available, a minimum of  
twenty (20) unstained slides of good quality is required. In si tuations where on-treatment biopsies 
or surgeries are performed, tumor sample should be sent for cen tral pathology reading.
5.6.1.1 Tumor sample collection details
Collection of tumor tissue at diagnostic surgery is required for  study eligibility. If clinically  
appropriate, additional biopsies obtained at any time, eg, if p rogression is suspected, may also be  
collected. 
Biopsy samples from ne urosurgical resections should be fixed in 10% Neutral-buffered formalin  
for 24 – 48 hours prior to paraffin embedding. Tumor tissue sampl es should not be shipped in  
formalin as the temperature and length of fixation cannot be co ntrolled during shipping.
In order to provide adequ ate tissue for MGMT testing and explorat ory analyses, two paraffin 
blocks are requested (1 minimum). If only slides are available,  they should be unstained, have a
recommended tissue section thickness is 4 microns and must be p ositively charge d. Slides should  
be shipped refrigerated at 2-8 °C.
An assessment of tissue quality by a pathologist is strongly en couraged at the time of the  
procedure. The tumor tissue that is obtained will be divided in  the following priority order: 1) into  
formalin for fixation and paraffin-embedding, 2) into RNALater for RNA/DNA extraction.Sample shipments should include a completed requisition form co ntaining co llection d ate, 
collection method, primary/met, site, fixation conditions, and a copy of Pathology report, if
available.

Detailed instructions of the ob taining, processing, labeling, h andling, storage and shipment of 
specimens will be provided in a separate Procedure Manual at the time of study initiation.
5.6.1.2 MGMT status
Randomization to this study is limited to subjects with establi shed unmethylated MGMT status. 
Testing will be performed using a centralized RT-PCR assay. Det ails regarding MGMT testing are 
provided in Section 5.6.1.1 .
 
 
 
 
 
5.6.1.4 Characterization of T cell repertoire
As described a bove, DNA sequenci ng may be pe rformed on pre-and post-treatment tum or tissue 
to assess the composition of the T cell repertoire. DNA will be  isolated from either the FFPE tumor 
block or from RNAlater or equivalent preparations.
5.6.1.5 Gene expression profiling
Tumor tissue collected in RNAlater or equivalent fixative will b e examined for mRNA gene 
expression by Affymetrix gene array technology and/or quantitat ive real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) to detect expression of selected immune related genes.
5.6.1.6 Tumor genotyping, mutational analysis, and tumor antigen profilingDNA and RNA from tumor samples will be analyzed using whole-exo me and transcriptome 
sequencing to determine the number of mutations found within a given sample relative to a normal 
host tissue, such as adjacent non-transformed cells or PBMC. Mu tations that are detected will be 
analyzed for thei r ability to bind the MHC I and MHC II protein s using prediction al gorithms, such 
as NetMHC. Evaluating the ability of tumor mutations to bind MHC  molecules will provide 
evidence that these mutations are serving as antigens that are recognized by the immune system 
and are potential rejection antigens.

7 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL 
COMMITTEES
When required, adjudicated events will be submitted to the DMC and Health Authori ties for review 
on a specified timeframe in accordance with the adjudication do cumentation.
A Data Monitoring Committee w ill be established to  provide oversight of safety and eff icacy 
evaluation of the entire study and to provide advice to the spo nsor regarding actions the committee 
deems necessary for the continuing protection of subjects. The DMC will be charged with 
assessing such actions in light of an acceptable benefit/risk p rofile for nivolumab. The DMC will 
act in an advisory capacity to BMS and w ill monitor s ubject safety and evaluate the available 
efficacy data for the study. The oncology therapeutic area of B MS has primary responsibility for 
design and conduct of the study. The DMC will meet at least eve ry 6 months or more frequently 
as needed on an ad-hoc basis. Information regarding DMC membership, responsibilities, and 
procedures are detailed in the DMC charter. The DMC will be inf ormed should a safety signal 
emerge and may convene an ad-hoc meeting on its own initiative. The DMC will review all 
available data (safety and efficacy) at each meeting. At the co nclusion of each DMC meeting, the 
committee will provide the sponsor with a recommendation to con tinue, modify, or terminate the 
study protocol ba sed upon their review. Ultimately, decisions r egarding the study protocol will be 
made by the sponsor in conjunction with feedback from investiga tors and the DMC.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
This is a Phase 3, randomized, open label, multicenter study of RT + nivolumab versus RT + TMZ 
in adult ( ≥18 years) subjects with newly diagnosed GBM subjects with unmeth ylated MGMT 
tumors.
Primary objective of the st udy is to compare the OS of RT+ nivolumab versus RT+TMZ in subje cts 
with newly diagnosed GBM subjects with unmethylated MGMT tumors after surgery.The sample size for this study is based on the following assump tions:
1) OS follows exponential distribution
2) Median OS in RT + TM Z arm is 13.0 months (Weller 2009
34)
3) Hazard ratio (HR) of arm RT + nivolumab vs RT + TMZ is 0.72, tr anslated to median OS 
improvement of 5.0 months (13.0 months vs 18.0 months for arm RT + TMZ and arm RT +
nivolumab, respectively)
At least 390 events (ie, death) provides 90% power to detect a h azard ration (HR) of 0.72 with an 
overall type 1 error of 0.05 (two-sided). This translates to an observed HR of 0.82 (median OS of 
13.0 vs 15.8 months ) or less resulting in a statist ically signif icant improvement.

Approximately 550 subjects will be r andomized to the two arms (R T +nivolumab vs RT + TMZ) 
in a 1:1 ratio stratified by comp lete or partial  resection at ba seline. Accrual will take approximately  
10 months. The total duration of the study from start of random ization t o final analysis of OS is  
expected to be approximately 33 months (10 months of accrual + 23 months of follow-up, Table

The PFS, overall survival at 24 mo nths (OS[24]), and OS and PFS i n TMB-high patients are  
secondary endpoints. OS[24] is included as secondary endpoint t o evaluate the improvement in  
long term survival. Only PFS will be tested using a hierarchical  testing procedure. ( Section 8.4.2 ). 
8.2 Populations for Analyses
•All Enrolled subjects: All subjects who signed an informed cons ent form and were registered  
into the IVRS. 
•All Randomized sub jects: All enrolled subjects who were randomi zed to any treatment arm.  
This is the primary dataset for analyses of efficacy parameters and baseline characteristics.
•All Treated subjects: All randomized subjects who received at l east one dose of study drug. 
This is the primary dataset for safety and exposure analyses.
8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary endpoint is OS. OS is  defined as the time between th e date of randomization and the  
date of death due to any cause. A subject who has not died will be censored at the last known alive  
date. OS will be followed continuously while subjects are on st udy drug and every 3 months ( ±14 
days) via in-person or phone contact during survival follow-up phase of the study.

8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The first secondary objective (comparing PFS between arm RT + nivolumab and RT + TMZ) will 
be measured by the endpoint of PFS. PFS is defined as the time from rando mization t o the date of 
the first documented tumor progression or death due to any caus e. Subjects who die without a 
reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. Subjects who did 
not have disease progression or die will be censored at the dat e of last tumor assessment. Subjects 
who did not have any on study tumor assessment and did not die will be censored at the 
randomization d ate. Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy wi thout a prior 
reported progression will be censored at the last tumor assessm ent prior to initiation of the 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy . Subjects who had surgical resect ion post start of study treatment
will be censored at the last tumor assessment date prior to initi ation of surgical resection. PFS will 
be determined by investigator reported response based on RANO criteria (Section 5.4.3 ). 
The secondary objective (estimate the overall survival r ate at 24 months (OS[24]) of RT + 
nivolumab) will be Kaplan-Meier probability of survival at 24 m onths. 
The secondary objective is OS and PFS assessed in the TMB-high p opulation, as assessed in the 
TMB assay where the numerical cut-off for high versus low will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Definition for OS and PFS for this endpoin t will be the s ame as defined 
earlier.

8.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics w ill be summarized for  all ra ndomized subjects by 
treatment group, as randomized, using descriptive statistics.
8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
The analyses of primary (OS) and secondary (PFS, OS[24]) endpoints wi ll be based on all 
randomized sub jects. Safety summaries will be b ased on all treated subjects . If superiority in OS 
is demonstrated, a hierarchical hypothesis testing approach for  the secondary endpoint of PFS will 
be used to preserve a familywise type I error rate at 0.05. 
The formal statistical testing for PFS w ill take place onl y if OS is s tatistically significant.
Secondary  endpoints of OS [24] and OS and PFS in  the TMB-high population w ill be estimated 
using the Kaplan Meier method.

The distribution of OS in all randomized subjects will be compar ed in arms RT + nivolumab and 
RT + TMZ at the final analysis via a two-sided, log-rank test, st ratified by comp lete resection or 
partial resection at baseline.  The Kaplan-Meir produ ct limit met hod w ill be used to es timate the 
survival curve in each arm inc luding medians and its 95% CI, OS rates at pre-specified time points.
The HR and the corresponding two-sided 95% CIs will be estimate d in a Cox proportional hazards 
model with treatment arm as a s ingle covariate stratified by co rresponding stratification factor 
(complete or partial surgical resection at baseline).
8.4.2.2 Analyses of Secondary Endpoints
The comparison of PFS will be based on a two-sided log-rank tes t stratified by corresponding 
stratification factor (complete surgical or partial resection at  baseline). The details of the testing 
procedure will be specified in the SAP. OS[24] will be estimated  when all censored subjects have 
had follow-up of at least 24 months. OS and PFS in the TMB-high  population will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional details for the analy sis of OS [24] e ndpoint w ill be

Term Definition
Complete AbstinenceComplete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. 
This also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual life style of the 
patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women must continue to have pregnancy  tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly or less effective contraception’s must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.

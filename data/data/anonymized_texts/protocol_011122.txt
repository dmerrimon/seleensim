TITLE  INtima Versus Adventitia Drug Delivery to Elucidate Mechanisms of 
Restenosis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (INVADER MRI)  
  SPONSOR  National Institutes of Health

  FUNDING 
ORGANIZATION  NIH NHLBI  
NUMBER OF SITES  2 
  RATIONALE  Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects at least 12 million Americans 
annually with more than half a million patients undergoing an 
endovascular or surgical revascularization procedure for treatment of  
the disease. Unfortunately, about two -thirds of patien ts still have 
blockages in the leg arteries, even after these procedures.  
 
Advances in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer promise for 
understanding the mechanism of failure through insights into vessel 
wall composition , remodeling,  and inflammation . Restenosis has a 
known relationship to inflammation. Advances in micro -catheter  
technologies offe r the ability to deliver  anti-inflammatory medications 
such as dexamethasone (DEX)  directly to the adventitia .  
 
This study aims to investigate if patient -specific parameters affect 
angioplasty out comes, if DEX has a biological effect on the vessel 
wall, and if this effect is through the reduction of inflammation.  
  STUDY DESIGN  Prospective, multi -center randomized  Phase IV trial. 
  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  The primary objective is to assess the mechanism s of vascular 
healing following balloon angioplasty treatment to stenotic arteries 
from atherosclerosis.  Vascular healing will be assessed by MRI 
determined percent wall volume change (PWV) from 24 hours post -
angioplasty to 12 months  
 
  SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES  1. To determine whether DEX infusion will result in less 
inflammation as measured by blood (MCP -1, CRP, and IL -1β) 
and tissue imaging ( Ktrans) markers of inflammation  
2. To determine whether patient -specific physiological factors 
correlate w ith vascular healing

      DURATION OF 
SUBJECT 
PARTICIPATION AND 
DURATION OF STUDY  Subjects will be on study for up to 36 months  
Screening:  up to 30  days  
Follow -up:  36 months  
The total duration of the study is expected to be 60 months .  3.5 
years  for subject recruitment, twelve months  for final subject follow -
up, and six months for final data clean -up.  
E    PRIMARY ENDPOINT  The primary endpoint for this study will be percent wall volume (PWV) 
change of the treated segment  from the 24 -hour post -intervention 
MRI scan to 12 months between DEX  treated and non-DEX (PTX or 
POBA)  treated patients.  
CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 19 of 72 
 The treated segment is defined as t he length of vessel, 
encompassing  the index lesion , that has undergone primary 
revascularization, from normal back to normal artery.  
  STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  The primary analysis will be an intention -to-treat (ITT) comparison of 
observed change in mean ΔPWV between treatment groups at 12 
months using a t -test. Because ΔPWV may be nonlinear in time, 
linear splines with knots at 24 hours, 1 month, 6 months,  and 12 
months will be used to fit the model.  
Multivariable regression models will be constructed to determine 
independent variables associated with ΔPWV controlling for 
demographic and anatomical variables, statin use, inflammatory 
markers, and smoking.  
We will also investigate effects by treatment received by constructing 
generalized linear models controlling for demographic, clinical, and 
anatomic variables. Predictors of PWV will be evaluated via 
univariate and multivariate regression analysis.  
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  The sample size for  this study is based on the statistical hypothesis 
for the primary endpoint, observed change in mean ΔPWV between 
groups at 12 months.  
While there are no predicate serial studies of PWV changes in 
femoral artery restenosis following angioplasty to estimat e the 
sample size, previous work on the progression of de novo 
atherosclerosis in similar sized peripheral arteries (carotids) forms the 
basis of this  estimation.  
Based on the power calculations outlined in  Sec 16.4 , we es timate 
the need for 22 subjects p er treatment assignment to detect a 2.7% 
difference in PWV at a power level of 80%.  
Assigning a 20% attrition rate due to loss to follow up and/or index  
lesion revascularization, 27 subjects will be enrolled per arm. 
Calculation is based on an unpaired t -test at a 5% significance level.

 1 BACKGROUND  
 
Population to be studied  
This is a randomized trial designed to explore the mechanisms of restenosis following balloon 
angioplasty.  This trial will evaluate subjects with peripheral artery disease who require an 
endovascular intervention of the femoropopliteal arterial segment (SFA/Popliteal)  to restore 
blood flow to the leg. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a condition defined by extensive 
accumulation of atherosclerotic plaque below the distal aorta that reduces lower limb arterial 
perfusion  and results in ischemia on demand noted as intermittent claudication or ischemic rest 
pain or ulceration known as critical limb ischemia . The SFA is the most common peripheral 
artery affected in patients with PAD and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the 
most common mode of treatment. PTA may be used alone or in combination with another 
treatment modality such as a stent or debulking device but it serves as the primary treatment 
platform for restoring blood flow to the leg. There is an estimat ed 800,000 SFA procedures 
performed worldwide annually, representing a market of approximately $1.5 billion. Roughly 
450,000 of those cases are performed in the United States with an overall market growth 
estimated in the mid -single digits.  
 
The Current T reatment of PAD and the Epidemic of Restenosis  
Balloon angioplasty (PTA) is the cornerstone of endovascular treatment of arteries.   A balloon is 
used to deploy , or used for post -dilation of,  vascular stents (balloon expandable).  PTA is also 
used in conjunc tion with debulking therapy. However, u ntil recently PTA was rarely used as a 
single modality to treat arterial stenosis  except in the short lesions, (TASC II A, < 5 cm), due to 
the high rate of binary restenosis 67% (primary patency 33%, Krisna Rocha Sing h). This high 
rate of failure for PTA was also noted in the control arm of the Zilver PTX study which evaluated 
a paclitaxel covered stent compared to  balloon angioplasty  alone .   More recently, better PTA 
techniques ha ve resulted in  decreased restenosis rates of PTA to about 50%.  This 
improvement occurred as a result of 1) sequential dilation of the stenosis with progressively  
larger balloons, 2) slower inflation of each balloon  to reach nominal dilation, and 3) longer 
inflation times of each balloon at nominal pressure often exceeding 2 minutes, and limiting the 
inflation atmospheres and barotrauma.   Further improvement was attained by adding a 
proprietary matrix to the balloon surface to allow paclitaxel  (PTX)  to be delivered into the artery 
wall.  These are known as drug -coated balloons (DCB) and there are 3 approved by the FDA: 
the INPACT Admiral DCB (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis MN), the Lutonix 035 DCB (C. R. Bard 
Inc, Covington GA) and the Stellarex DCB (Spectranetics Corp, Colorado Springs CO).  In 
general, the effectiveness and safety profiles of these devices are not substantially 
different. Primary patency rates in selected lesions can approach 75% with these devices 
under trial conditions (<10cm lesions, claudication pati ents) and they are reported to attain 
clinically -driven target lesion revascularization (cd -TLR), similar to stents.  One concern about 
DCBs is that the depot drug delivery is at the intima surface.  To reach the deeper layers of the 
arterial wall the drug  must diffuse down its concentration gradient in accordance with Fick’s Law  
𝜕
𝜕𝑡=-D2, where 𝜕
𝜕𝑡 is the diffusion flux, D is the diffusion coefficient, 2 is the Laplacian 
operator, and  is the amount if drug in dimensions mol/mm3. =(x,t) is a function which 
depends on location  x and time,  t, in seconds. Therefore, the initial concentration of the drug will 
be highest in the intima until , over time, the drug diffuse s evenly through the vessel wall. This 
potentially could inhibit re -endothelialization of the treated area and cause increased restenosis 
after the drug is no longer retained in the wall.  This would be referred to as late catch up where 
the treatment arm would catch up to the  control arm after a specified period of time.  In the 
CHR#15 -17251

 coronaries first generation paclitaxel stents have been known to cause late stent thrombosis 
due to delinquent endothelialization over the stent struts.  This phenomenon  necessitates 
prolonged dual ant iplatelet therapy (DAPT) . Because of these reasons and others, as will be 
explained below, the adventitia is an alternative to the intima in drug delivery.     
It is desirable to avoid stents in leg arteries if possible as vascular stents are susceptible to 
micro -abrasion, friction, and fatigue.1 Constant micro -forces associated with daily ambulation 
lead to stent fractures and restenosis. Once restenosis occurs within a stent, it is very difficult to 
regain and maintain patency of the artery.2 Further, future therapy options such as bypass 
surgery become limited due to the stent implant and many consider this to “burn bridges” for 
future revascularization options. In fact, more bypass surgery is now being performed after 
failed stenting than fo r de novo lesions, and studies show that bypass surgery performed after 
failed stenting have worse outcomes.3 This truly is an epidemic of restenosis.4  
  
The Tunica Adventitia is an Active Participant in Arterial Restenosis  
Once thought to be a passive la yer of the arterial wall, the tunica adventitia is now known to be 
extremely metabolically active and capable of regulating vascular hemostasis.8, 9 The adventitia 
contains a rich variety of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, progen itor cells, 
and fibroblasts that can differentiate into myofibroblasts.10-13 There is extensive microvascular 
architecture, which can traffic inflammatory cells into the vessel wall following injury.14 Balloon 
angioplasty experiments in pig coronary arteri es demonstrate that the adventitia is the primary 
site for acute inflammation after mechanical vascular injury.15 The hypothesis that these cells 
contribute to intimal hyperplasia and restenosis is supported by several lines of evidence in 
animals. In porc ine models of angioplasty, injections with 5 -bromo -2-deoxyuridine (BrDU) have 
identified proliferating cells located in the adventitia as early as two days following injury which 
appear to migrate into the inner vessel in subsequent time points.16, 17 Shi et al. noted that 
adventitial myofibroblasts contribute to increases in wall volumes via synthesis of extracellular 
matrix and collagen and migration to the intima following balloon injury.18, 19 Finally, utilizing in 
vivo reporter gene transfer studies in to adventitial cells, Siow et al. demonstrated adventitial 
myofibrob last migration into the media and intima following balloon injury.20 Collectively, these 
studies support an “outside -in” hypothesis of vascular inflammation and provide important 
biologica l rationale to target the adventitia to reduce restenosis.  
 
Restenosis is an Inflammatory Process  
Balloon angioplasty produces a barotraum atic (8-15 atmospheres) mechanical injury, resulting 
in stress signals and homing of inflammatory cells into the artery.15, 21, 22 We have shown in a 
porcine balloon injury model that inflammatory cells peak in the adventitia early after injury and 
then slowly decline over the next 28 days.23 P-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule -1 
(VCAM -1) is up -regulated i n vasa vasorum endothelial cells soon after balloon injury thus 
providing a means for increased inflammatory cell trafficking.15 Vasa vasorum expansion occurs 
in de novo atherosclerosis and following balloon injury, and drugs targeting neoangiogenesis 
are potential therapies to reduce restenosis.24-26 Microcomputed tomography imaging 
demonstrates a direct correlation between the computed tomography -determined extent of 
adventitial angiogenesis and the extent of intimal hyperplasia.27-29 In addition to an in crease in 
microvascular density, vascular inflammation is also associated with increased adventitial 
microvasculature permeability. Examination of atherosclerotic coronary arteries from autopsy 
specimens show that vasa vasorum invading the media from the a dventitia lack mural coverage 
and inter -endothelial contact at endothelial junctions is either incomplete or absent in 76% of the 
vessels.24, 30, 31 These histological factors make them inherently more permeable.30 MRI 
employing dynamic contrast techniques  with kinetic modeling can measure adventitial perfusion 
CHR#15 -17251

 which is a function of both the permeability and the surface area of the adventitial vascu lature . 
This highly validated technology forms the basis of in vivo assessment of vascular inflammation 
and t he therapeutic response of mitigating drugs.  
  
Glucocorticoid Receptor as a Therapeutic Target for Vascular Injury  
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of 
ligand -activated transcription factors. Activatio n of GR results in binding of receptor homodimers 
to glucocorticoid response elements in target genes, leading to initiation or repression of 
transcription. Cortisol is the naturally occurring ligand to the GR and unbound fraction of cortisol 
can diffuse t hrough the cell wall to interact with the cytosolic receptor. DEX is a synthetic 
glucocorticoid with 25 -fold higher binding affinity to GR than cortisol and no mineralocorticoid 
activity.32 GRs are present in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells.  
DEX may inhibit restenosis in several possible ways as it is known to repress angioplasty -
induced immune response programs by inhibiting inflammatory transcription factors, NFκB and 
AP-1, and their downstream mediators.33, 34 In vitro and preclinical studi es have demonstrated 
that DEX down -regulates monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP -1), tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF -α), and interleukin 1β in nano - and micromolar concentrations in vascular SMCs.35, 36 IL-1β 
is known to stimulate SMC proliferation and to induce basic fibroblast growth factor in vascular 
SMCs. Intra -muscular DEX treatment demonstrated decreased macrophages present in 
atherosclerotic lesions and inhibition of macrophage accumulation follo wing balloon angioplasty 
in cholesterol fed rabbits.37 DEX has been shown to inhibit the proliferation and migration of 
smooth muscle and inflammatory cells as well as adventitial myofibroblasts through effects on 
thymidine kinase, matrix metalloproteinase s, and retinoblastoma protein.38-40 DEX inhibits the 
autocrine induction of PDGF -α chains – a known potent SMC mitogen. DEX induces the anti -
inflammatory proteins annexin 1 and mitogen activated kinase phosphatase 1, while repressing 
the transcription of p ro-inflammatory molecules such as cyclooxygenase 2.32 DEX also markedly 
inhibits the production of ROS by inflammatory cells in vivo. DEX increases the immune -
modulatory cytokine IL -10, which is known to inhibit the pro -inflammatory TH1 cells.41 DEX also 
inhibits collagen production and extracellular matrix synthesis, which is responsible for late 
lumen loss following PTA42, 43 and thought to be due to negative (shrinkage) arterial 
remodeling.44 The latter is pertinent to the present application as Derksen et al., noted that 
fibrotic plaques rich in collagen and SMCs were associated with more constrictive remodeling 
following PTA.45  
Clinical studies demonstrate that DEX treatment has shown an ability to mitigate the initial 
inflammatory response to vascular  injury. For example, patients with unstable angina treated 
with DEX -eluting stents had lower plasma concentrations of CRP, ICAM - 1, and VCAM -1 post -
intervention compared to patients treated with a bare metal stent.46, 47 Two coronary studies 
independently  tested the use of the BiodivYsio Matrix Lo stent loaded with DEX versus the 
same stent platform without drug as control. Han et al. randomly assigned a total of 92 patients 
to the DEX or control group.48 The use of DEX -eluting stents was the only independ ent predictor 
for the major adverse cardiac event at 12 months (relative risk 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 -0.68, P = 
.009) and binary restenosis at 6 months (relative risk 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 -0.60, P = .006) by 
multivariate analysis. In a similar study, Konig et al. ra ndomly assigned 120 patients with acute 
coronary syndrome to revascularization using the Dexamet stent or BMS.49 The target lesion 
revascularization rate was lower in the Dexamet group (16.67% vs 33.33% patients; P = .031) 
and angiography revealed improved  lumen restoration in the Dexamet stent group (late lumen 
loss, 0.55 ± 0.65 vs. 1.07 ± 0.92 mm P = .001).

 1.1 Overview of Clinical Studies  
 
Pharmacokinetic Studies of Dexamethas one In Porcine Carotid Arteries  
The DEX pharmacokinetic (PK) profile has been demonstrated in a study of the M icro-Infusion 
catheter delivery into the adventitial tissue of porcine carotid arteries, Figure 1. In this study, 
therapeutic levels in the range of 10 to 100 nM were seen at 7 days after infusion of 1 mg.  
 
Figure 1.  Dexamethasone levels measured in pig carotid arteries 1, 4, and 7 days after 
confirmed delivery of 1 mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate in 3 ml volume to the carotid 
artery adventitia with the Bullfrog M icro-Infusion catheter. Each line represents a single  artery.  
While the exact duration of the therapeutic window to treat vascular inflammation is unknown, 
based on preclinical PTA models, the optimal time frame is 7 -30 days. This is supported by 
another porcine preclinical study employing femoral artery ba lloon injury model,23 where it was 
determined that the adventitial leukocyte infiltration is decreased by 60% of peak value within 28 
days, Figure 2. Clinical experience with steroids also support this time frame as a pulsed, 
intensive therapy for 3 -7 days  is sufficient to treat most soft tissue inflammatory processes.  
 
 
Results of t he safety and feasibility study  
We conducted a Phase 1, first -in-man safety and feasibility study of DEX delivery to femoral and 
popliteal adve ntitia (NCT 01507558) with the B ullfrog Micro-Infusion
 catheter (Mercator 
MedSystems, Emeryville , CA).7 Patients with SFA stenosis or occlusions up to 15 cm were 
eligible for this study. Mean lesion length was 8.9±5.3 cm, N=20 with 80% located in the distal 
SFA/popliteal artery, which has traditionally been considered a no stent zone. The mean 
number of inf usions required to completely treat each lesion was 3.0 ± 1.3, minimum 1 and 
maximum 6. The mean volume injected was 3.8 ± 1.9 ml which contained a mean of 12.1 ± 6.1 

CHR#15 -17251

 mg of DEX and .80 ± .4 ml of contrast. This equated to a mean of 1.6 ± 1.1 mg of DEX per 
centimeter of lesion length. The minimal dose was 3.2 mg and the maximal dose a patient 
received was 24 mg of DEX. Accordingly,  there was a positive linear correlation between the 
amount of DEX received and length of lesion treated, R2=.27, P=.019.  
Proced ural safety was seen in 100% of patients, with a lack of drug -related or device -related 
serious adverse events or major adverse limb events within 30 days of the procedure. At the 6 
month follow up, two subjects had experienced a target lesion restenosis, as defined by a peak 
systolic velocity ratio (PSV lesion /PSV reference ) > 2.4 or occlusion noted by ultrasound for a 
90% patency rate. The ankle -brachial index improved from 0.67 ± 0.17 pre -op to 0.88 ± 0.18 at 
6 months (P<0.003) and Rutherford classificatio n scores decreased from 3.1 ±. 71 to 0.5 ± .70, 
p<.001 indicating improved hemodynamic and clinical benefit with DEX.

Markers of technical success u sing the M icro-Infusion catheter  
The M icro-Infusion catheter (Mercator MedSystems, Emeryville , CA), a FDA 510K -cleared 
device, is a  rapid - exchange, wire -guided catheter with a balloon -sheathed 1.5 mm long, 35 -
gauge (140 μm diameter) needle that delivers infusions to adventitial and perivascular tissues. 
Using standard angioplasty inflation equipment, the balloon is inflated exposing the needle. 
When the balloon contacts the arterial wall opposite the needle tip, contact pressure forces the 
needle through the vessel wall and into the adventitia and perivascular tissues.

  Figure 4. The fluoroscopy picture to the left demonstrates three 
separate infusions of DEX and contrast along the artery wall. A 
.014 wire can be seen within the lumen of the artery and the 
Glow ‘N T ell tape provides a reference. After about three 
minutes,  further longitudinal diffusion within the adventitia 
obscures the border between the separate infusions.  
 
The contact pressure of the balloon against the artery wall is limited to 2 atmospheres by a 
pressure release valve, which prevents damage to the a rtery wall. A mixture of infusate and 
contrast (4:1) is then delivered under fluoroscopic guidance at a rate of 1 ml/min to the 
adventitia and perivascular tissues. When the infusion is complete, the balloon is deflated, 
sheathing the needle, and allowing the catheter to be withdrawn. The drug contrast admixture 
can be seen as “staining” along the blood vessel providing visual confirmation of su ccessful 
drug delivery, Figure 4  (left). It is our experience that a single injection produces 360° delivery of 
drug around the circumference of the vessel coverage and extends approximately 1 -2 cm 
proximally and distally from the point of injection. Thus, a single injection circumferentially treats 
3-4 cm of artery. This catheter has been shown to be one of the most efficient modes of drug 
delivery as it maximizes tissue concentration while minimizing off -target drug deliver.50 The 
micro -infusion catheter has been used to deliver stem cells into the adventitia of coronary 
arteries to improve myocardial function follow ing infarction.51  
 
Drug Coated Balloon  
In this study , angioplasty must be carried out with an FDA -approved DCB balloon  catheter for 
treatment of arteries and veins according to the manufacturer’s instructions for us e. The 
INPACT SFA, LEVANT 2 , ILLUMENATE PIVOTAL  and ILLUMENATE EU trials were 
paramount Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) safety and effectiveness trials.   
The LEVANT 2 study was a prospective, multicenter, single -blind, randomized, safety and 
efficacy study which randomized in a 2:1 assignment  of 316 subjects treated with Lutonix DCB 
and 160 subjects treated with POBA .  Balloon angioplasty had to be successful prior to 
enrollment.  Only 11 patients were excluded due to unsuccessful balloon angioplasty.  
Physicians evaluating the  patients in follow up were blinded to the treatment assignment of the 
patient.  The study population consisted mostly of Rutherford 2 and 3 patients.  Freedom from 
the primary safety endpoint  (composite all cause 30 day death, device related death at 365 
days, index limb amputation, target vessel revascularization)  evaluated graphically by Kaplan -
Meier analysis (ITT) was 86.7% in the test DCB arm and 81.5% in the control arm.  The primary 
effectiveness endpoint was freedom from binary restenosis or target lesion revascularization 
was 73.5% in the DCB text arm and 56.8%  in the control arm.

 The INPACT SFA study was a multicenter, single -blind, randomized controlled safety and 
efficacy study with a 2:1 randomization scheme that included 220 subjects treated with INPACT 
DCB and 111 subjects treated with POBA. Randomization occurred once the les ion was 
crossed and successful initial balloon angioplasty was performed.  It is not known how many 
subjects were excluded due to unsuccessful balloon angioplasty. Freedom from the primary 
safety endpoint, freedom from device or procedural related death at  30 days or index limb 
amputation or target vessel revascularization, occurred in 95.6% in the test DCB group and 
76.6% in the control group.  Primary patency was 78.4% in the DCB test group a nd 49.5% in the 
control group. Although the subject was blinded to the treatment provided, the local research 
team was not. All primary endpoint events were adjudicated by a core laboratory and Clinical 
Events Committee, both of whom were blinded to the treatment provided.  
 
The ILLLUMENATE PIVOTAL study was a m ulticenter, single -blind, randomized controlled 
safety and efficacy study with a 2:1 randomization scheme that included 200 subjects treated 
with Stellarex DCB and 100 subjects treated with POBA. Randomization occurred after 
successful lesion crossing and initial balloon angioplasty with 11 subjects excluded due to 
unsuccessful initial balloon angioplasty.  Although the subject was blinded to the treatment 
provided, the local research team was not. All primary endpoint events were adjudicated by a 
core labo ratory and Clinical Events Committee, both of whom were blinded to the treatment 
provided. Freedom from the primary safety endpoint (composite of 30 -day freedom from device 
and procedure -related death and 1 year freedom from target limb major amputation an d CD -
TLR) was 92.1% in the DCB group and 83.2% in the control group. Freedom from primary 
effectiveness endpoint (restenosis or CD -TLR at 1 year) was 76.3% in the DCB group and 
57.6% in the control group.  
 
All DCBs lose paclitaxel during the delivery and i nflation of the balloon. The ILLLUMENATE 
PIVOTAL trial included a 25 subject pharmacokinetic substudy that found plasma paclitaxel was 
measurable in all subjects at 24 hours after Stellarex DCB treatment and was no longer 
detectable in all but 1 subject at  7 days. It appears that the proprietary paclitaxel formulation and 
excipient combination for each brand of DCB determines the nature of the shed paclitaxel. In a 
comparison of healthy swine femoral arteries treated with INPACT or Lutonix DCBs, there was 
measurable paclitaxel in the downstream (non -target) tissues at 90 days, with significantly 
higher levels measured after INPACT DCB. In addition, embolized “crystalline -like material” was 
seen in the downstream tissue after treatment with INPACT but not Lut onix DCB.  
 
In December 2018, a meta -analysis of published randomized clinical trials demonstrated a 
significantly increased late (3 -5 year) mortality rate in subjects treated with paclitaxel -coated 
devices for femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease. In response to this meta -analysis, the 
FDA has issued 3 letters advising health care practitioners and convened a "public meeting of 
the Circulatory System Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee" from June 
19-20, 2019. An FDA "Letter to Healt hcare Providers" from August 9, 2019 summarized the 
FDA's analysis of available trial data with the conclusion that "the crude mortality rate at 5 years 
was 19.8% (range 15.9% - 23.4%) in patients treated with paclitaxel -coated devices compared 
to 12.7% (r ange 11.2% - 14.0%) in subjects treated with uncoated devices. The relative risk for 
increased mortality at 5 years was 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.16 – 2.13), which 
corresponds to a 57% relative increase in mortality in patients treated with paclitaxe l-coated

 Dynamic Contra st Enhanced -MRI Measurem ent of Adventitial Inflammation  
The tunica adventitia thickness of human peripheral arteries can be visualized with imaging 
modalities with sub -millimeter spatial resolution. For example, MRI can detect this layer 
following contrast  injection due its ring -like enhancement. We have demonstrated the feasibility 
of applying dynamic contrast -enhanced MRI (DCE -MRI) with kinetic modeling to study 
adventitial perfusion, which generates physiological parameters of vasa vasorum.52 
Characteriz ation of microvessel density is pertinent to the present application as adventitial 
inflammation and restenosis is associated with increased microvessel density necessary to 
support the increase in wall volume. We have shown in a porcine balloon injury mod el that 
microvessels were associated with restenosis.23 In validation studies in individuals with carotid 
stenosis, Ktrans was positively and significantly correlated with plasma CRP, thus providing an in 
vivo link between vascular wall inflammation and a blood marker of inflammation. Human 
validation histologic studies were also completed in patients having DCE -MRI scans prio r to 
carotid endarterectomy. These studies demonstrated correlation of Ktrans and endarterectomy 
specimen neovasculature (R=0.41, P=.04) and macrophages (R=0.49, P=.01) supplied by vasa 
vasorum.53  
DCE -MRI has also been used to provide information on the t herapeutic effect of drugs on the 
vascular wall. In a study evaluating the effects of intensive lipid therapy targeting low density 
lipoprotein to below 60 mg/dl in subjects with extant cardiovascular disease, there were 
significant differences in adventit ial Ktrans at 12 months after lipid therapy (0.067 ± 0.028 min-1) 
compared with baseline (0.085 ± 0.037 min-1, p=.02).  
 
 
Figure 5 . Left: Kinetic analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI of carotid atherosclerosis 
yields a parametric image “vasa vasorum” displaying the value of fractional blood volume (ν p) in 
red and transfer constant ( Ktrans) in green. The rapid transfer in the vessel adventitia is indicated 
using yellow arrows. Right:  Image is derived from kinetic modeling of changing intensity in serial 
images coinciding with contrast agent.  
 
Computational Fluid Dynamics  
Balloon angioplasty induces barotrauma (8 -16 atmospheres) to the artery to redistribute the 
arterial wall mass, expand the arterial volume, with the goal to increase the lumen volume of the 
treated segment. This results in luminal irregularities, dissections, and residual stenosis within 
the artery. We propose that the resulting flow disturbances and shear stress gradients 
predispose to areas of restenosis due to increased wall thickening or negative remodeling. 
Surprisingly, there has been relatively little attention given to serial changes in blood flow and 
shear stress following angioplasty in the leg. CFD methodologies d eveloped by our group are

 pertinent to the present application.54-56 To examine the relationship between arteriovenous 
fistula remodeling and flow parameters, we have conducted serial CFD -derived flow analysis 
that was carried out at three time points: 5 d ays, 30 days, and 90 days following creation of the 
anastomosis. Non -contrast enhanced time -of-flight (TOF)  magnetic resonance angiogram 
(MRA ) datasets were used to acquire patient -specific geometries at each time point. Phase 
contrast magnetic resonance v elocimetry (PC -MRV) measurements were obtained at each 
imaging session and used to prescribe time - dependent velocity boundary conditions for the 
computational models. CFD simulations were carried out using the methodology described 
below. Velocity fields and wall shear stress (WSS) distributions obtained at each time point were 
then compared. The c omputational results in Figure 5  show that the size of the vessels 
increased and the WSS values substantially reduced with the maturation of the fistula.  
 
Plaqu e compositional analysis and arterial remodeling assessment with MRI  
It is unlikely that one specific type of therapy will be suited for every SFA plaque type. For 
example, Derksen et al. determined that femoral plaques with more fibrous tissue had higher 
rates of restenosis. Therefore, knowledge of plaque composition and adventitial perfusion by 
MRI may help guide the type of therapy. MRI has been shown to provide an accurate virtual 
histological map of vascular plaques in femoral and carotid arteri es based on pixel signal 
intensity (see section below) using multicontrast MRI.57,58 In prior studies, we have matched 
carotid endarterectomy histology sections via landmarks to MRI images obtained in vivo prior to 
surgery to ascertain the sensitivity and specificity of MRI tissue characterization.59,60 For plaques 
> 2 mm2, in vivo assessment of plaque composition can be accomplished with high sensitivity 
(79% to 95%) and moderate to high specificity (76% to 91%).61 We have also examined the 
inter- and intra- reader reproducibility for detecting tissue areas with respect to total vessel area. 
The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for lipid rich necrotic core (LRNC), calcification, and 
fibrous tissue was between .88 and .95.62,63 In this applicatio n, we will characterize SFA plaque 
composition and associate each with response to DEX  or PTX (control)  treatment.

2 STUDY RATIONALE  
The fundamental hypothesis of this trial is that inhibition of inflammation at the site of 
injury will result in improved vascular healing and a sustained patent artery.  
This trial  is designed to explore the mechanism of restenosis by using two alternativ e 
approaches to drug delivery, intimal -based antiproliferative (paclitaxel) and adventitial -based 
anti-inflammatory  (Dexamethasone) . Safety concerns about paclitaxel have halted that 
treatment arm in favor of plain balloon angioplasty . Angioplasty creates a mechanical injury to 
the atherosclerotic vascular wall resulting in an inflammatory response as a multitude of growth 
factors and cytokines, catalysts for cellular proliferation and restenosis, are released. 
Subsequent restenosis is related to the magnit ude of the inflammatory response which  is more 
pronounced in the femoral artery than in other vascular beds. Clinical trials of therapies to 
suppress vascular inflammation were initially successful, but were not fully developed in favor of 
anti-proliferati ve drugs, which have been highly successful in the coronary arteries, but not in 
leg arteries. Hence, the hypothesis that inhibition of vascular inflammation at the time of 
treatment can improve outcomes remains to be tested . Information on the healing res ponse of 
the vessel wall following treatment is limited. Duplex ultrasound and quantitative angiography 
are sensitive to changes in the vessel lumen but provide no information on the vessel wall or 
remodeling. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with black -blood and multi -
contrast imaging techniques now offer a non -invasive means to evaluate the geometric and 
compositional morphology of the vessel wall at sub -millimeter resolution. Further insights into 
the vascular wall can be obtained with  dynamic -contrast imaging techniques, which is capable 
of providing information on vessel wall perfusion arising from adventitial vasa vasorum. Thus, 
modern MRI affords deep structural and physiological insights into the vasculature and is ideally 
suited f or serial in vivo studies to monitor the biologic response to therapy.    
  
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
2.1.1  Anticipated Clinical Benefits  
In this trial, balloon angioplasty of the superficial femoral or popliteal artery will be followed with 
either:  
1. an adventitial infusion of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (USB, 4mg/mL)  
or  
2. no further treatment . 
There are no guaranteed benefits for subjects participating in the trial.   
2.1.2  Anticipated Adverse Events  to balloon angioplasty of the SFA  
• Additional intervention  
• Allergic reaction to drugs or contrast

2.1.3  Possible Risks of Participation in this Clinical Trial  
2.1.3.1  Procedural Risks of Adventitial Infusion  
Likely: (likelihood >5%)  
• Irritation or extravasation of blood at the perivas cular injection site – typically mild and 
self-limited. Less damage than balloon angioplasty or atherectomy.  
• Perivascular air injection – due to incorrect preparation of catheter for injection; 
harmless, involves a volume of <1.5mL and is typically self -limited (air is reabsorbed).  
• Device balloon rupture – due to incorrect preparation of the device balloon; low 
frequency event in prior device use and testing as there is a pressure relief valve to 
prevent over -inflation of the device balloon; there are no ad verse effects due to simple 
balloon rupture (device is discarded after removal from the patient).  
Rare: (likelihood <1%)  
• Vessel spasm – due to incorrect catheter sizing for target vessel; usually self -limited, but 
may require further treatment (balloon ang ioplasty) if severe.  
• Vessel dissection – due to incorrect catheter sizing for target vessel, excessive vessel 
wall thickness or mis -administration of medication; may require further treatment 
(balloon angioplasty or stent) if severe.  
• Vessel thrombosis – due to incorrect catheter sizing for target vessel or prolonged 
inflation of catheter balloon; may require further treatment (balloon angioplasty, stent, 
embolectomy, thrombolysis) if severe.  
• Distal emboli – due to incorrect catheter sizing for target vessel  or disruption of vessel 
wall plaque; may require further treatment (embolectomy, thrombolysis) if severe.  
CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 36 of 72 
 Extremely Rare: (likelihood <0.1%)  
• Arteriovenous fistula – complication of perivascular injection; extremely rare given 
needle length and diameter; m ay require further treatment (stent) if severe.  
• Pseudoaneurysm – bleeding complication at site of perivascular injection, extremely rare 
given needle length and diameter; may require further treatment if severe.  
• Device balloon fragmentation with emboli – device failure, extremely rare event in prior 
device use and testing as there is a pressure relief valve to prevent over -inflation of the 
device balloon; may require further treatment (embolectomy, thrombolysis) if severe.  
• Device component separation - due to incorrect use of the device or manufacturing 
failure; rare event in prior device use testing as there is a pressure relief valve to prevent 
over-inflation of the device balloon; may require further treatment (embolectomy) if 
components embolize.  
2.1.3.2  Risks o f Dexamethasone  
The Contraindications, Warnings, Precautions, Adverse Reactions and Overdosage sections of 
the Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection, USP, package insert should be consulted 
prior to administration of the drug.  
We plan to administer a single dose of dexamethasone in the perivascular space. Therefore, we 
expect the risk of systemic adverse effects typically associated with repeated, long -term, supra -
physiologic doses of dexamethasone will be very low. This expectation is bas ed on the following 
data:  
1. Delivery of dexamethasone  (DEX)  will be localized to the perivascular tissues . Thus we 
expect the pharmacokinetics to be similar to the local administration of dexamethasone 
in soft tissue. A study comparing adventitial drug delivery  of DEX  vs. a drug -infusion 
balloon vs. intravenous administration  of DEX  in swine coronary arteries found  that 
adventitial delivery was the only method with a high -concentration of study drug in the 
target tissue (myocardium) and negligible levels in liver, lungs, blood or urine [ 50]. 
2. Each infusion of dexamethasone in the range of 2 to 7.5 mL (1.6 mg dexameth asone per 
1 cm of target artery, with a total dose of 6.4 to 24 m g for expected treat ed segment  
lengths  of approximately 4 -15 cm) is within the common dose range of dexamethasone 
for adults per the manufacturer’s dosing instructions.  
Likely: (likelihood >5 %) 
• None  
Less Likely: (likelihood <5%)  
• Hyperglycemia, particularly in patients with diabetes - effect is likely transient 
(<24hrs), possible need for increased insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.  
Rare: (likelihood <1%)  
• Hypertension - likely transient, poss ible need for increased antihypertensive therapy.  
Extremely Rare: (likelihood <0.1%)  
• Allergic reaction - typically in response to preservatives in the medication. Can range 
from allergic dermatitis to severe, life -threatening anaphylactic reactions support ive 
care and monitoring. Dexamethasone will be administered in the OR with the patient 
under observation by both the surgeon and anesthesiologist.  
CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 37 of 72 
 • Vessel wall necrosis - multiple studies with dexamethasone eluting stents in lab 
animals and humans have not found evidence of vessel wall necrosis (see 
background studies) but this is a theoretical risk that would require further 
intervention (stenting) to treat.  
• Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: sodium retention, fluid retention, congestive heart 
failure in s usceptible patients, potassium loss, hypokalemic alkalosis, or 
hypertension.  
• Musculoskeletal: muscle weakness, steroid myopathy, loss of muscle mass, 
osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, aseptic necrosis of femoral and 
humeral heads, pathologic f racture of long bones, or tendon rupture.  
• Gastrointestinal: peptic ulcer with possible subsequent perforation and hemorrhage, 
perforation of the small and large bowel, particularly in patients with inflammatory 
bowel disease, pancreatitis, abdominal disten tion, or ulcerative esophagitis.  
• Dermatologic: impaired wound healing, thin fragile skin, petechiae and ecchymosis , 
erythema, increased sweating, may suppress reactions to skin tests, burning or 
tingling, especially in the perineal area (after I.V. injecti on), or other cutaneous 
reactions, such as allergic dermatitis, urticaria, angioneurotic edema.  
• Neurologic: convulsions, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema 
(pseudotumor cerebri) usually after treatment, vertigo, headache, or psychic 
disturban ces. 
• Endocrine: menstrual irregularities, development of cushingoid state, suppression of 
growth in children, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, 
particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery, or illness, decreased 
carbohydrat e tolerance, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, increased 
requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetics, or hirsutism.  
• Ophthalmic: posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, 
glaucoma, or exophthalmos.  
• Meta bolic: negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism.  
• Cardiovascular, myocardial rupture following recent myocardial infarction (see 
WARNINGS in drug labeling).  
• Other: anaphylactoid or hypersensitivity reactions, thromboembolism, weight gain, 
increas ed appetite, nausea, malaise, or hiccups.  
• The following additional adverse reactions are related to parenteral corticosteroid 
therapy: rare instances of blindness associated with intralesional therapy around the 
face and head, hyperpigmentation or hypopigm entation, subcutaneous and 
cutaneous atrophy, sterile abscess, infection, postinjection flare (following intra -
articular use), or charcot -like arthropathy  
2.1.3.3  Risks of Paclitaxel  
Paclitaxel is the active agent on FDA approved DCBs.  Paclitaxel inhibits smooth muscle cell 
(SMC) and fibroblast proliferation, migration, and matrix synthesis by modulating microtubule 
polymerization (stabilizes). Because SMC s and fibroblast s are the pri mary cellular components 
of the neointimal hyperplastic response, they are thought to be the mechanism by which 
paclitaxel improves the patency of arteries.  Other agents that are known as excipients are 
carried on the balloon to allow the paclitaxel to be  delivered to the target artery and then to 
partition into the artery when the balloon contacts the arterial wall.  INPACT Admiral DCB uses 
CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 38 of 72 
 urea as the excipient, the Lutonix 035 DCB uses sorbitol and polysorbate  and the Stellarex uses 
polyethylene glycol,  a polymer excipient .  Urea is a natural occurring product of protein 
metabolism and carried in the blood stream as blood urea nitrogen.  The urea released from a 
DCB is about 20,000 fold lower than what is normally produced in the body.  Both sorbitol and  
polysorbate are FDA approved and regulated and are ubiquitous in many household products  
such as  toothpaste, cough syrup, hard candy, diabetic sweeteners (sorbitol), and shampoo, 
lubricants, cosmetics (polysorbate).   Similarly, polyethylene  glycol  is used  in household products 
like creams, lubricants, toothpaste, gum and has several industrial and biologic uses as well. 
The combination of [paclitaxel + urea ], [paclitaxel + sorbitol and polysorbate ] and [crystalline 
paclitaxel + polyethylene glycol] are known as the matrix on the balloon surface.   
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel release following treatment with a balloon catheter has been 
studied.  The time to maximal plasma concentration following DCB inflation is a bout 10 minutes 
and the Cmax is less than 8 ng/ml in each balloon. Typical infusions of paclitaxel for cancer 
treatment are 135 – 175 mg/m2, yielding a C max that is 2170 -3650 ng/ml. Hence maximal 
plasm a levels of paclitaxel are over 200 -fold less than typi cal levels used to treat cancer. 
Plasma levels fall to less than 3 ng/ml within one hour’s time. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel 
demonstrated a bi -exponential decay characterized by a rapid redistribution and then and log -
linear elimination phase. The h alf-life is 72 hours.  The metabolism of p aclitaxel is catalyzed  by 
cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 as well as being a substrate for P -
glycoprotein.   No formal drug -drug interactions studies have been performed but drugs 
metabolized by the same e nzymes may interfere with paclitaxel metabolism.  
Concerns about the safety of paclitaxel  (PTX) coated devices have led to recommendations  by 
the FDA that “for many patients, alternative treatment options for paclitaxel -coated balloons and 
paclitaxel -elutin g stents provide a more favorable benefit -risk profile.” Subjects are no longer 
treated with paclitaxel DCBs. In this study, those subjects already treated with PTX will be 
monitored for adverse events.  
Potential adverse events  
Likely: (likelihood >5%)  
• None  
Less Likely: (likelihood <5%)  
• increased risk of death  
Rare: (likelihood <1%)  
• none  
Extremely Rare: (likelihood <0.1%)  
• Hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel manifested as a cutaneous rash  
• Emboli of the matrix INPACT balloon  
• Peripheral neuropathy  
 
2.1.3.4  Risk s of MRI and Gadolidium Contrast Agent  
Gadolinium reactions may occur but they are extremely rare. The incidence of adverse 
reactions ranges from  1-1.4% and may consist of nausea and vomiting to anaphylaxis. Life -
threatening reactions to gadolinium are  extremely rare. Mild reactions are also rare and usually 
self-limited. In patients who have compromised kidney  function, the use of gadolinium agents 
has also been associated with a rare but serious condition, called  Nephrogenic Systemic 
CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 39 of 72 
 Fibrosis (NSF). Kidne y function is measured by a value termed eGFR (estimated  Glomerular 
Filtration Rate) in units of ml/min/1.73m2. There have been no reported cases of NSF in 
individuals  with eG FR > 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Following the guidelines of the MR Safety 
Committee at UCS F/SFVAMC and  UW, we will measure creatinine levels and determine the 
eGFR in all patients in this study as part of their preoperative  assessment. If eGFR is < 30 
ml/min/1.73m2 then subjects are excluded from participation in this  research study. If eGFR is < 
60 ml/min/1.73m2 but > 30 ml/min/1.73m2 the minimal dose of gadolinium necessary will be 
used after consultation with a radiologist.  
The FDA is investigating the risk of br ain deposits following the repeated use of gadolinium 
based contrast agents (GBCAs) for MRI. Recent publications in the medical literature have 
reported that deposits of GBCAs remain in the brains of some patients  who undergo four or 
more contrast MRI scan s, long after the last administration.  It is unknown whether these 
gadolinium deposits are harmful or can lead to adverse health effects. These effects have only 
been seen in the linear chelates of Gd.  For this reasons, the protocol will avoid the use of  linear 
chelates.   
The additional risk of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires that the subject be placed in a 
small and confined space for periods of time, and this can lead to claustrophobia in some 
patients. Electric implants, such as cardiac pace makers, may be susceptible to interference 
from the magnet and RF fields produced by the MR instrument. Persons with cardiac 
pacemakers or other implanted electronic devices are prohibited from entering a zone where the 
magnetic field exceeds five gauss. T he magnetic field of the MR instrument is strong enough to 
forcefully attract ferromagnetic objects. The inadvertent introduction of ferromagnetic materials 
in the proximity to the magnet may result in such objects becoming projectiles, which could 
present  a risk to subjects and other persons. This force can cause a ferromagnetic implant, 
such as an aneurysm clip, surgical clip, or prosthesis, to move or be dislodged. Entry to the 
magnet area is possible only through a single door beside the operator’s cons ole, which is 
guarded by the technologist during the study. A technologist screens all persons before they 
enter  the magnet area. In addition, warning signs are posted.  
The Bureau of Radiologic Health has issued guidelines for the amount of radiofrequency energy 
which may be  employed in imaging subjects in order to ensure that the procedure does not 
entail more than minimal risk. If  energy beyond this value is used, some subjects may undergo 
an evaluation in body temperature. If energy  which grossly exceeds  this guideline is used, the 
subject may receive soft tissue burns. Both the Siemens and  the GE MR System includes both 
software and hardware limits, which prevent selection of imaging sequences  from exceeding the 
energy deposition guidelines of the Bureau  of Radiologic Health. All studies will be  conducted 
below this energy limit.  
2.1.3.5  Other Risks  
The following study activities involve only minimal risk to participants:  
• Blood Draw  - Phlebotomy involved in this study poses minimal risk to the subject; 
however, b ruising may be expected around the venipuncture site. Occasional, 
dizziness and vasovagal episodes occur.  
• Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)  - May involve minor discomfort similar to a standard 
brachial blood pressure measurement.

healing  
 
  
4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Study Overview  
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to determine the mechanisms of vascular 
healing . The study will evaluate subjects with peripheral artery disease (PAD) who require an 
endovascular intervention of the femoropopliteal arterial segment (SFA/Popliteal)  to restore 
blood flow to the leg.  
The total duration of su bject participation will be 36 months. Total duration of the study is 
expected to be five years . 
4.2 Specific Aims  
1. To determine whether adventitial DEX infusion will result in improved vascular 
healing following femoral artery angioplasty , with the following Statistical 
Hypotheses : 
a. Advent itial DEX infusion will result in reduced change in percent wall volume 
(ΔPWV) within the treated segment.  
b. Adventitial DEX infusion will result in improved vascular remodeling of the treated 
segment.  
2. To determine whether DEX infusion will result in less in flammation as measured by 
blood (MCP -1, CRP, and IL -1β) and imaging ( Ktrans) markers of inflammation, with the 
following Statistical Hypotheses : 
a. Adventitial DEX infusion will result in reduced peri -operative inflammatory profile.  
b. Adventitial DEX infusion will result in less adventitial perfusion (a surrogate of 
inflammation) as measured by kinetic modeling of dynamic contrast -enhanced 
MRI.  
c. Peri-operative inflammatory profile will be associated with ΔPWV.  
3. To determine whether patient -specific physi ological factors correlate with 
vascular healing , with the following Statistical Hypotheses : 
a. Treat ed segment remodeling will be associated with the fibrous volume in 
plaques.  
CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 41 of 72 
 b. Treat ed segment remodeling will be associated with wall shear stress provided 
by MRI determined, patient -specific, geometry and computational fluid dynamics.

CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 44 of 72 
 8.2 Formulation  of Treatment  
This trial uses FDA approved drugs and devices and therefore there is no te st product. This trial 
will use commercially available dexamethasone sodium phosphate USP and iodixanol contrast 
medium  (320 mg I/ml) .  A copy of the dexamethasone sodium phosphate USP label is included 
as Appendix 4 . The trial also uses a M icro-Infusion cathe ter, used in accordance with the IFU.  
8.2.1  Packaging and Labeling  
 DEX is widely available throughout the hospital and carried in the hospital formulary.  It is 
available in all anesthesia carts and is commonly used intravenously to treat allergic reactions 
during surgery.  
8.3 Supply of DEX at the Site  
Each site is responsi ble for obtaining DEX and maintaining inventory.  
8.3.1  Dosage/Dosage Regimen  
This protocol will utilize a 4 mg/ml preparation of Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection,  
USP. Each milliliter of the solution contains 4.37 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate  
equivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone phosphate or 3.33 mg of dexamethasone. The  
Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection, USP will be mixed 80%:20% with iodinated  
contrast medium  (iodixanol, 320 mg I/mL ) to diagnose the distribution of injectate. This will 
result in a final concentration  of 3.2 mg dexamethasone phosphate (3.5 mg dexamethasone 
sodium phosphate, or 2.67 mg  dexamethasone) and 60 -74 mg iodine in each mL  of solution.  
The dosage proposed for this clinical trial is 1.6 mg of Dexamethasone Sodium Phosp hate per 
cm of lesion. The  typical  length of lesions range from 4 -15 cm in length  so each infusion will 
range  from 2 to 7.5 ml for a total one -time perivascular dosage in each patient of 6.4 to 24 m g.  
Multiple infusions are possible and thus allowance of up to 20% loss due to variability in 
anatomy, distribution patter n, or intravascular diagnostics . The 4 mg/ml dexamethasone solution 
will be diluted to 3.2 mg/ml with contrast medium to track infusions.  Based  on the distribution 
seen with similar infusions, each 0.5  mL of infusion would be intended to treat 1.0 cm of vessel 
segment, with multiple doses  as needed to treat longer diseased regions.    
8.3.2  Dispensing  
This study is an open label study. The primary  operator performing the angioplasty is not 
blinded to the treatment assignment of the patient . Therefore, DEX may be obtained from the 
clinical pharmacy.  DEX will  be diluted with contrast under sterile conditions in  the OR  and 
delivered to the tissue using the B ullfrog Micro-Infusion catheter device.  
8.3.3  Administration Instructions  
DEX, which will be mixed with contrast in the operating  or the catheterization room, will be 
labelled with name, concentration, and date, in accordance with standard operating procedures 
per institutional policy.  
8.3.4  Storage  
 DEX will be stored in accordance with the manufacturer’s label or IFU.  The expiration date will 
be noted prior to use and a ny expired drug or device will be discarded and will not be used in 
this study.

 8.4 DEX Accountability  
An accurate and current accounti ng of the dispensing of DEX for each subject will be 
maintained by study staff .   
8.5 Supply of Devices at the Site  
The intent  of this trial is to study the mechanisms of angioplasty failure.  Therefore,  there are no 
investigational devices used in the trial.  All devices and drugs used in the study are FDA 
approved and are being used as indicated.  The site is responsible for bu ying angioplasty 
balloons and equipment including adventitial infusion catheters.  
9 STUDY PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES  
A Schedule of Events representing the required testing procedures to be performed for the 
duration of the s tudy is diagrammed in Section 10 “Schedule of Assessments” . 
Prior to conducting any study -related activities, written informed consent and the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be signed and dated by 
the subject . If appropriate, assent must also be obtained prior to conducting any study -related 
activities.   
 
9.1 Clinical Assessments  
9.1.1  Pregnancy Test  
Female subjects of childbe aring potential will receive a s erum βHCG pregnancy test. Only 
women who are surgical ly sterile  or postmenopausal may be considered to not be of 
childbearing potential and thus are exempt from this test.  
Postmenopausal is further defined:  
1. If the woman is over 50 years of age and has experienced no menstruation for 12 
consecutive months, she is “pos tmenopausal”.  
2. If the woman is under 50 years of age, has experienced no menstruation for 12 
consecutive months, and provides verification by an endocrinologist or gynecologist, 
then she is “postmenopausal”.  
Assessment will occur at: Screening.  
9.1.2  Demographics   
Demographic information (date of birth, gender, race) will be recorded . 
Assessment will occur at: Baseline.  
9.1.3  Medical History  
Relevant medical history, including history of current disease, other pertinent cardiovascular 
history, and information regarding underlying diseases will be recorded.  
Assessment will occur at: Baseline.

 9.1.4  Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medication and concurrent therapies will be recorded during the study visits 
described below and at early termination wh en applicable.  Dos age, units , route, frequency of 
administration, and dates of medication will be captured.  
Assessment s will occur at: Baseline, Post-Op, Month 1, Month 6, and Month 12.  
9.1.5  Vital Signs  
Body temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respirations will be recorded as part of their 
standard clinical care. Results from these exams will be recorded by study staff.  
Assessment s will occur at: Baseline, Post-Op, Month 1, Month 6, and Month 12.  
9.1.6  Physical Examination  
An appropriate physical examination will be performed by qualified clinical staff (MD, NP, PA , 
RN or trained research assistant ) as part of their standard clinical care . Results from these 
exams will be recorded by study staff.  
Assessment s will occur at: Baseline, Post-Op, Month  1, Month 6, and Month 12. 
9.1.7  Vascular Examination  
A comp lete vascular pulse examination, Ankle -Brachial Index (ABI), and Rutherford 
Categorization will be performed by qualified clinical staff (MD, NP, RN, or PA) or research staff  
under the supervisi on of a study investigator . Results of the exam will be recorded by study 
staff.  
The Ankle -Brachial Index (ABI) examination will be performed according to current, accepted 
guidelines.  Subjects will rest 10 minutes in a supine position prior to the exam. The ABI will be 
defined as the ratio between the higher of the two pedal systolic blood pressures (dorsalis pedis 
and posterior tibialis) and the higher of the two systolic brachial pressures. A continuous wave 
Doppler, between 5 and 12 MHz, will be used to measure the systolic pressures in both the 
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries in each leg, as well as the brachial arteries in each 
arm. The ABI will be calculated for both legs. In the event the pedal / tibial vessels are 
noncompressible , a toe brachial index may be used.  
Rutherford Categories will be defined by patient -reported pai n-free walking distance. Table 1  
related Rutherford Categories to objective criteria and to common patient -reported distances.

9.5 Treated Segment Registration  
During the index procedure, the investigator will identify an “index lesion ”, which is a segment of 
the SFA and/or popliteal artery  that meets the procedural inclusion/exclusion criteria (see 
Section 6). The index lesion will fall  within the following constraints:  
1. The index lesion will be between  the femoral  bifurcation and the infrapopliteal trifurcation  
(specifically, the take-off of the anterior tibial artery) .  
2. If the femoropopliteal arterial segment has diffuse disease , there  must be at least 2 cm 
of “normal” vessel proximal and distal to the index lesion . A “normal ” vessel is defined as  
having  < 20% stenosis.  
3. If a subject has multiple lesions that meet the procedural inclusion/exclusion criteria , the 
investigator may choose any qualif ied lesion as the index lesion .  
A Glow ‘N Tell radiopaque tape (LaMa itre Vascular, Burlingame MA) will be placed at the 
subject’s medial tibial spine  as the “0 cm” mark, topographically overly ing the knee cap and the 
numbers increase proximally . The lesion length, location, and degree of stenosis/occlusion will 
be documented.  
Following a  successful revascularization , the treated segment will be registered to the nearest 
millimeter on the tape , including 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the actual trea ted lesion.  
9.6 Randomization  
An opaque envelope scheme will be used to reveal the allocation intra -operatively. Prior to the 
procedure, study staff will identify the next sequential Randomization ID and bring this envelope 
to the OR.  Once Procedural Criteria have been assessed and th e subject passes, study staff 
will record the Randomization ID on procedural CRFs, open the envelope, and reveal the 
assignment (DEX vs POBA ).    
A full description of the Randomization process is given in Sec. 16.4  “Sample Size & 
Randomization ”. 
9.7 DEX Infusion  
Patients randomized to the DEX group will receive dexamethasone infusion after the primary 
revascularization procedure and before any provisio nal stenting. The equipment, order of 
operations, and dosing instructions are described below.  
9.7.1  Equipment  
A micro -infusion catheter (Mercator Cricket, Bullfrog, or Bullfrog XL) will be used to deliver FDA -
approved Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection, U SP, 4 mg/ml, mixed with FDA -
approved non -ionic contrast medium to the index lesion  
9.8 Order of Operations  
Research procedures will be performed in between steps of a clinical procedure. In general, the 
order of operations is as follows:  
1. Establish vascular acc ess 
2. Initial angiogram  
3. Place Glow ‘N Tell tape 
4. Index lesion registration  with respect to knee joint  
CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 50 of 72 
 5. Primary revascularization  
6. Assessment of Procedural Inclusion /Exclusion  Criteria  
7. Treated segment registration with respect to knee joint  
8. Randomization  
9. DEX infusion or POBA  
10. Provisional stenting  
11. Completion angiography  
 
Primary Revascularization : A balloon shall be selected such that the  diameter  is 1 mm less 
than the vessel reference diameter. To secure good results, slow inflation, prolonged  inflation  (3 
min) at nominal pressure should be used. O ne additional inflation  may be used to ensure good 
results.  If there is > 30 % residual stenosis, th at portion of the stenosis is ineligible to be included 
and a stent will be placed.  However,  if there  is a portion of the lesion that has adequate results 
and there is no anticipation of a stent , then the successfully PTA treated , but non -stented , 
segment can be registered as the treated segment . 
  
For subjects randomized to POBA , If the patient is randomized to POBA , then an appropriate 
sized device  may be used according to the IFU , at a 1:1 artery :balloon size ratio. The 
Investigator will complete the clinical portions of the procedure (e.g. completion angiograms)  per 
standard of care, Provisional stenting of the treated segment is allowed if clinically indicated.  
For subjects randomized to DEX , the Investigator will infuse dexamethasone (1.6 mg / cm 
lesion length). The investigator may administer DEX at multiple sites  along the treated segment  
and may reposition the Micro -Infusion Catheter as needed to establish successful distribution of 
the d rug along the treated segment . 
Imaging will be saved for the Core Lab (UCSF VipeRx Lab)  to assess the technical  success of 
drug administration, the extent of circumferential (or lateral using 2 -dimensional X -ray 
fluoroscopic guidance) and longitudinal cove rage of the artery by the contrast. The following 
scale will be used to grade the pattern of distribution:  
Technical success is defined as grades A, B or C   
 
Table 2: Diffusion grades and distribution patterns  
 
Provisional stenting of the treated segment is allowed if clinically indicated.

 9.9 Research MRI  
A research MRI will be performed to assess change in Percent Wall Volume (Δ PWV ) and 
transfer constant ( Ktrans) following the procedure. Specific details of the pr otocol are discussed 
below.  
Assessment s of ΔPWV will occur: at Post-Op, Month 6, and Month 12.   
Assessment s of Ktrans will occur at: Month 1 and Month 6 . 
9.9.1  Equipment  
A research MRI wi ll be obtained on either a 3T S iemens Skyra  MRI (Erlangen Germany) 
(SFVAMC/UCSF) or a 3T Philips Achieva MRI (Philips Healthcare, Netherlands) (UW) using a 
phased -array coil wrapped around the leg at the level of the region of interest.  
9.9.2  Protocol  
Patien ts will be scanned with a phased array coil placed such that the  anterior portion covers 
the fe moral segment and the posterior section coverage includes the popliteal segment of the 
artery. The scan landmark will be positioned at a point approximately 20 cm proximal to the 
knee joint, and that location will be advanced  to the center of the magnet.  The 3D black blood 
study will be performed centered with zero offset in the head -foot direction. The superior tip of 
the medial tibial spine will be identified on the 3D black blood images.  The targeted 2D T1, T2 
and DCE seq uences will be centered 20 centimeters proximal to  the medial tibial spine 
landmark, in the adductor canal, as this is considered to be the most likely location of the 
treated segment .  
After the location of the treated segment is identified, a specific se t of MRA s equences will be 
performed. The sequences vary by study visit. A description of the sequences  and requirements  
is provided in Table 3.

 Pre MERGE /DASH (DANTE prepared -FLASH): These sequences are high -resolution, 3D 
black -blood imaging of the vessel wall, which are achieved by using a preparation pulse to null 
the signal from flowing blood. MERGE uses an MSDE ( Motion Sensitive Driving Equilibrium) 
prep-pulse, with a Rapid Gradient Echo acquisition. DASH uses a DANTE prep -pulse ( Delay 
Alternating with Nutation for Tailored Excitation) with a FLASH sequence ( Flash Low Angle 
Shot). These sequences are essentially different implementations to achieve the  same goal of 
vessel wall imaging, and they both contain a motion -sensitive preparation (to null the signal from 
the blood) coupled to a fast gradient echo acquisition.  
 
2D-T1: This is a 2D, high -resolution, T1 weighted sequence. T1 image weighting measure s the 
spin-lattice relaxation time of hydrogen protons in a tissue.  
 
2D-T2: This is a 2D, high -resolution, T2 weighted sequence. T2 image weighting measures the 
spin-spin relaxation time of hydrogen protons in a tissue.  
 
MP RAGE: This is a 3D, T1 -weighted , Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo 
sequence and provides information about blood degradation products in tissues.  
 
DCE: Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI is a T1 -weighted sequence with high temporal 
resolution, acquired after the injection of a gadolinium -based contrast agent  (e.g. Omniscan, 
Gadavist, or ProHance) . This sequence allows for measurement of the passage of contrast 
agent, which gives information about physiological tissue characteristics such as the integrity 
and perfu sion/permeability of the vessel wall. This imaging sequence is used to calculate Ktrans. 
 
The protocol for the Delayed Contrast Enhancement for this study requires an i njection of Gd 
contrast agent:  
A half dose of Gadolinium is injected.  For Magnevist thi s corresponds to (0.1ml of 
Magnevist)/(kg patient weight) and for Gadavist this corresponds to (0.05ml of Gadavist)/(kg 
patient weight of Gadavist).  If Gadavist is used it is diluted 50:50 with saline.  This ensures that 
the total volume injected is the s ame independent of whether Magnevist or Gadavist is used.   
Injection timing:  
The DCE scan is first started.  The contrast should then be injected at the end of the first 
dynamic run, at an injection rate of 1cc/sec, and immediately followed by a saline flush of 15 cc 
saline also at 1cc/sec.  Dynamic scanning should not be not inter rupted during the injection 
delivery.  
 
CE-MRA:  Contrast -Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography is a pulse sequence acquired 
with the simultaneous intravenous injection of a gadolinium -based contrast agent. Gadolinium 
shortens the T1 relaxation time of blo od. This allows for fast image acquisition, with high signal 
intensity in the lumen of vessels (where gadolinium is present), and low signal in extravascular 
territories (where gadolinium is not present). This sequence will give the geometry of the lumen 
used for CFD simulations.  
This sequence is usually acquired after using a timing bolus in order to evaluate the time it takes 
from injection to the arrival of the contrast bolus to the vessel of interest (scan delay). Contrast 
CHR#15 -17251    
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 53 of 72 
 agent is generally delivered a t 2mL/second.) Typically, the timing bolus is 2mL, 1:1 
gadolinium:saline while the full bolus for CE -MRA is 20mL, also 1:1 gadolinium/saline.  
 
Post  MERGE/DASH:  These 3D black blood sequences are acquired shortly after contrast 
administration to evaluate fo r contrast enhancement (uptake of gadolinium in the vessel wall).  
PC-MRI:  Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a technique that allows for the 
measurement of blood flow. This is accomplished by placing a bipolar gradient along a vessel of 
interest . As hydrogen protons of blood flow along this vessel of interest, they accumulate a 
phase shift that is proportional to their speed. In this way, we are able to non -invasively 
measure the velocity and flow of blood. This sequence will allow description of  the inlet flow 
conditions which will be used to generate CFD models.  
The acquisitions parameters are provided in Appendix 3 . 
Data files from SFVAMC research MRIs will be sent to the University of Washington for 
analysis.  Data files from University of Washington will be sent to SFVAMC for CFD modelling.  
Study staff performing the analysis of MRIs will be blinded as to the subject ID and study visit.  
 
9.9.3  Pre-Reintervention MRI  
If the patient proceeds to a reintervention  durin g the study period, and it has been  longer than 
30 days  since the last  research MRI study, an additional MRI study of the treated segment  will 
be performed  prior to the reintervention.  
9.10 Clinical Ultrasound  
A standard -of-care clinical ultrasound will be obtained at follow -up visits. The exam will cover 
the iliac, femoropopliteal, and infrapopliteal arterial segments and will include Doppler pulse 
wave velocities and B -mode diameter measurements of each segmen t.

12 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
12.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unint ended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration 
of an investigational product, whether related to that investigational product  or not .  An 
unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the 
information in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for  the occurrence of AEs during 
each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events 
will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by duration (start and 
stop dates and times), severity, outco me, treatment and relation to the index procedure , or if 
unrelated, the cause.   
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities 
judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found in the study manual.  If the 
experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown  below,  in Table 1, 
should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure 
of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of 
the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospitalizations possible.  
CHR#15 -17251   Confidential  
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 60 of 72 
  
12.2 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed.  
12.2.1  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Study sites will document and report all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to index 
procedure ) within 5 business days  of investigator awareness , as per UCSF IRB Guidelines .  
The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is obtained and end after 
procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  
 
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report SAEs 
to the IRB/IEC.     
13 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
13.1 Early  Discontinuation /Withdrawal  
A subject may be discontinued from study treatment at any time if the subject, the investigator, 
or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  The following is a list 
of possible reasons for st udy treatment discontinuation:  
• Subject withdrawal of consent (or assent)  
• Subject is not compliant with study procedures  
• Adverse event that in the opinion of the investigator would be in the best interest of the 
subject to discontinue study treatment  (i.e. treated  segment restenosis /occlusion 
occurring between index procedure date and the 1 -month study follow -up date ) 
• Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
• Positive pregnancy test (females)  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Death  
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be followed 
and treated by the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or 
stabilized.   Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as 
it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
CHR#15 -17251   Confidential  
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 61 of 72 
 All subjects who decide to withdraw or discontinue study tr eatment should come in for an early 
discontinuation visit as soon as possible . 
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by the invest igator to provide a reason for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the 
subject’s source documents.  
  
13.2 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study treatment will not be replaced.   
 
14 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS  
A protocol vi olation occurs when the subject or  investigator fails to adhere to significant protocol 
requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, subject safety and primary endpoint criteria.  
Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Failure to meet inclusi on/exclusion criteria  
• Use of a prohibited concomitant medication  
• Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a 
protocol violation. The Investigator  will determine if a protocol violation will result in 
withdrawal of a  subject.  
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by the 
Investigator. A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s reg ulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s 
files. 
 
15 DATA SAFETY MONITORING  
Since this is a multi -institution al study, a Data Monitoring C ommittee  (DMC)  comprised of the 
principal investigator, two co -investigato rs (Drs. Hatsukami and Gasper ) will meet on a regular  
semi -annual basis to review the progress of the trial and address all safety issues. The minutes 
of the meetings will be submitted to the UCSF institutional review board.  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported  to the IRB within 5 business days  of 
investigator awareness  (or as per local IRB policy), followed to resolution and adjudicated. 
Adverse Events will also be grouped and analyzed in the following three distinct periods:  
1. From intervention through discharge from hospital;  
2. From hospital discharge until the 1 -month evaluation; and  
3. Beyond the 1 -month evaluation and through 36 months and completion of study 
participation.  
Adverse events will be documented on the AE Case Report Form. Those SA Es that are 
possibly related to the treatm ent (angioplasty, infusion  or drug), the procedure  (angiogram, 
access vessel, etc.), or the disease state being treated (PAD) may be reviewed and  adjudicated 
CHR#15 -17251   Confidential  
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 62 of 72 
 by an Independent Reviewer. All Serious Adverse Events and/or Unanticipated Adverse Device  
Effects  will be reported to the IRB per the IRB’s specific policies and guidelines.  
16 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
16.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
All eligible patients who  are randomized into the study will be included in the safety analysis  and 
descriptive statistic s of the study population . 
Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the parametric and nonparametric data with 
means and standard deviation or median and interquartile range where appropriate.  
Proportions will be used for categorical data.  
16.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study will be PWV change of the treated segment from the post-
operative  (1-7 days after intervention)  MRI scan to 12 months between DEX  treated and non-
DEX (PTX or POBA)  treated patients.  
Statistical hypothesis  1a: Adventitial DEX infusion will result in reduced change in percent wall 
volume (PWV) within the treated segment . 
Statistical Methods:  The p rimary analysis  will be an intention -to-treat (ITT) comparison of 
observed change in mean ΔPWV between treatment group s at 12 months using a t-test. 
Because ΔPWV may be nonlinear in time, linear splines with knots at 24 hours, 1 month, 6 
months, and 12 months will be used to fit the model. Multivariable regression models will be 
constructed to determine independent variab les associated with ΔPWV controlling  for 
demographic and anatomical variables, statin use, inflammatory markers, and smoking. We will 
also investigate effects by treatment received by constructing generalized linear models 
controlling for demographic, clin ical, and anatomic variables. Predictors of PWV will be 
evaluated via univariate and multivariate regression analysis.  
16.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Statistical hypothesis  1b: Adventitial DEX infusion will result in improved vascular remodeling 
of the treated segment.  
Statistical Methods: ITT comparison of observed change in remodeling between treatment 
groups at 12 months using a t-test. Models will be constructed similar to ΔP WV with attention or 
hemodynamic descriptors, WSS and OSI, derived by CFD and plaque composition which have 
both been hypothesized to influence vessel remodeling.  
 
Statistical hypothesis  2a: Adventitial DEX infusion will result in reduced peri -operative 
inflammatory profile . 
Statistical Methods: Each biomarker will be tested for normality and log -transformed as 
necessary. Descriptive statistics will record the mean and standard deviation (or median and 
inter-quartile range) of each biomarker at each time po int. Then, the area under the curve (AUC) 
will be calculated for each biomarker from baseline, 24 hours post -intervention, and the 1 month 
time point. ITT comparisons of the mean AUC between treatment assignments will be by a t-
test. 
 
  
CHR#15 -17251   Confidential  
 
Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 63 of 72 
 Statistical hypothesis  2b: Adventitial DEX infusion will result in less adventitial perfusion (a 
surrogate of  inflammation) as measured by kinetic modeling of dynamic contrast -enhanced MRI . 
Statistical Methods:  ITT Comparisons will be made between average Ktrans values of the two 
treatment groups using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Spearman rank correlation coefficient will 
be determined between VP and Ktrans values, and other variables such as smoking status, statin 
use, plaque component, and biomarker levels. Ktrans will also be assessed at baseline  MRI visit  
as a parameter of plaque inflammation for descriptive purposes. Ktrans will likely be difficult to 
assess in the freshly injured artery at the 24 hour MR I. 
 
Statistical hypothesis  2c: Peri-operative inflammatory profile will be associated with ΔPWV . 
Statistical Methods:  Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated between CRP, MCP -1, 
and IL -1β and confounding factors such as diabetes, foot ulcer, and treated segment length, 
etc. Multivariable linear regression models will be created with each inflammatory marker A UC 
as the dependent variable in order to determine the independent effect of inflammation on 
ΔPWV.  
 
Statistical hypothesis  3a:  Treat ed segment remodeling will be associated with the fibrous 
volume in the plaque.  
Statistical Methods:    Multi -contrast MRI will be used to determine the relative volumes of 
fibrous, calcification, and LRNC expressed as a percent of TVV for each treated segment in this 
study. Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be used to determine if patient -related factors or 
markers of in flammation are associated with plaque composition. Then multivariable regression 
equations will be generated to determine if fibrous tissue content is associated with remodeling. 
Models will be constructed with and without DEX to determine if DEX will chan ge the β -
coefficient of the association between fibrous tissue content and remodeling.  
 
Statistical hypothesis  3b: Treat ed segment remodeling/ΔPWV will be associated with wall 
shear stress provided by MRI -determined, patient -specific, geometry and computat ional fluid 
dynamics  
Statistical Methods: Hemodynamic parameters WSS, WSSG, and OSI, derived from CFD will 
be calculated at each MRI time point. Multivariable regression models will be constructed to 
determine the independent contribution of these paramete rs on treat ed segment remodeling 
and ΔPWV.  
Interim analyses will be made prior to DMC meetings and in preparation of publications.  
16.4 Sample Size and Randomization  
The sample size for this study is based on Statistical Hypothesis 1a. While there are no 
predicate serial studies of PWV changes in femoral artery restenosis following PTA to estimate 
the sample size, previous work on the progression of de novo atherosclerosis in similar sized 
peripheral arteries (carotids) forms the basis of this estimation  (please refer to Section 1.2  
reference numbers 70 and 71) . Power calculations were performed based on an expected 
reproducibility variance of 8% (determined from evaluations performed on measurements 
performed on the untreated leg for studies at multiple ti me points).  An effect size of 6.3% or 7% 
was assumed based on data from pilot studies. Based on power calculations, we estimate the 
need for 22 subjects/treatment assignment to detect a 7% difference in PWV at a power level of 
80%. Assigning a 20% attriti on rate due to loss to follow up or index lesion revascularization, 27

Version #: 1.8 Version Date: 10 OCT 2019  Page 64 of 72 
 subjects will be enrolled per arm. Calculation is based on an unpaired t test at a 5% significance 
level.

The Principal Investigator’s staff will develop and maintain a block randomizations scheme for 
each site. The scheme will be developed using Stata 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, 
USA) with a 1: 2 allocation  of DEX:POBA because the 9 or 10 subjects treated with DEX to this 
point will be carried forward in the analysis .  The block size will not be revealed to Investigators , 
to minimize bias. Allocation to treatment group will be tied to Randomization ID.  The 
Randomization ID will be assigned to a subject once the Procedural Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
are assessed.  Figure  6 illustrates the Study Enrollment and Randomization process.

 17 DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION AND MONITORING  
17.1 Data Collection Instruments  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents designed 
to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject treated with the  index 
procedure .   
Study personnel at each site will enter data from sour ce documents corresponding to a subject’s 
visit into the protocol -specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) when the information 
corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be identified by name i n the study 
database  but will be identified by a subject number.  
If a correction is required for an eCRF, the  time and date stamps track the person entering or 
updating eCRF data and creates an electronic audit trail. If a correction  is made on a paper 
source form , the study staff member will line through the incorrect data, write in the correct data 
and initial and date the change.  
The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this study.  All 
data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for completeness 
and accuracy by the Investigator.  A copy of the CRF will remain at the Investigator’s site at the 
completion of the study  pursuant to institutional record retent ion guidelines . 
17.2 Data Management Procedures  
The data will be entered into a validated database.  A staff member designated as the Data 
Manager will be responsible for data processing, in accordance with procedural documentation.  
Database lock will occur on ce quality assurance procedures have been completed.  
All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing 
practices meeting FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.  
Data will be shared  with collaborating investigators and contract laboratories as appropriate for 
analyses. Data will be coded or deidentified , according to the matrix in Appendix III – Data 
Management. The code will be maintained and kept secure by the Data Manager.  
17.3 Data Quality Control and Reporting  
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data validation 
checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. These checks will 
occur fo llowing the completion of each 10  study subjects. Ad hoc che cks may be initiated by the 
Investigator.  The study database will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries.  All 
changes to the study database will be documented.  
17.4 Archival of Data  
The database is safeguarded against unauthorized access by establi shed security procedures; 
appropriate backup copies of the database and related software files will be 
maintained.   Databases  are backed up by the database administrator in conjunction with any 
updates or changes to the database.    
At critical junctures of  the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final reports), data for 
analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures.  
17.5 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor , other authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB/IEC, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA)

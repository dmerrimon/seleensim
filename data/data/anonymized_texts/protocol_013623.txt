 2 Introduction  
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describes the statistical analysis for study CTH-300 and was 
finalized prior to unblinding of the study.  The SAP will serve as a compliment to the study protocol 
and supersedes it in case of differences.  In case of major differences between the study protocol and 
SAP (e.g. changes in the analysis related to the primary endpoint) , a protocol amendment will be 
considered.   
3 Study objective s 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of APL-130277 versus placebo 
in patients with Parkinson’s disease ( PD) over a 12 week period . 
4 Design and  type of the study  
This is a 12-week, prospective, multi- center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 
study 
in levodopa (L-Dopa) responsive PD patients with motor fluctuations, designed to determine the 
efficacy, safety and tolerability of APL-130277. 
The study includes initial Screening Visits, followed by an initial Dose Titration Phase in which 
individual responses to single doses of APL-130277 are evaluated in order to determine the optimal 
dose of APL-130277 for treating “OFF” episodes to be used in the maintenance phase of the study. 
Once complete, patients will be randomized to either the APL-130277 or placebo (ratio 1:1) and begin 
the Maintenance Treatment Phase of the study, where they will self-administer study medication in up 
to 5 doses per day to treat “OFF” episodes over the course of 12 week study in the at-home portion of 
the study. Patients will return to the clinic at regular intervals for safety and efficacy assessments 
(including in-office assessments of the primary endpoint). Overall duration of participation will be 
approximately 135 days. 
The following visits will be performed: 
 Screening Visits (SV1 and SV2) 
 Telephone Call (T1) 
 Dose Titration Phase 
o Titration Visit 1 (TV1) 
o Titration Visit 2 (TV2) 
o Titration Visit 3 (TV3) 
o Titration Visit 4 (TV4) 
o Titration Visit 5 (TV5)

Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Final 2017 -11-2 Study:  CTH -300 
 o Titration Visit 6 (TV6) 
 Maintenance Treatment Phase 
o Maintenance Visit 1 (MV1) 
o Maintenance Visit 2 (MV2) 
o Maintenance Visit 3 (MV3) 
o Maintenance Visit 4 (MV4) 
o Telephone Call (T2, T3, T4) 
o End of Study Visit (EOS) 
o Unscheduled Dose Adjustment Visits. 
The patients will be randomized centrally at a study level using a computer-generated randomization 
code. No stratification factors will be used. 
5 Endpoints  
5.1 Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study is the mean change from pre-dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score at 
30 minutes after dosing at the 12 week visit (MV4) of the Maintenance Treatment Phase. 
The MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score will be calculated as the sum of the individual items of the MDS-
UPDRS Part III questionnaire (items 3.1 –  3.18) and will be obtained separately at each assessment 
time point. Missing individual items will be imputed using the 2 non-missing  values at time points 
adjacent to the missing item on the same date. The maximum of the 2 adjacent values will be assigned 
as the score for the missing individual item.  However, pre -dose values will not be assigned as post -dose 
values and if one of the adjacent values for a post -dose value is a pre- dose value, only 1 adjacent value 
will be used. If a pre- dose value is missing, the pre -dose value at the p rior visit will be used . The 
maximum of the 2 adjacent values represents the worse outcome out of these potential values and may 
be seen as a conservative imputation. If there are more than three individual missing items  at a given 
time point , no imputation will be performed  and MDS -UPDRS  MOTOR  score will be assigned as 
missing . The MDS -UPDRS MOTOR  score will be calculated after imputation of the missing item(s)  as 
described above . 
5.2 Key secondary endpoint  
The key secondary endpoint of the study is the percentage of patient s with a patient-rated full “ON” 
response within 30 minutes after dosing at the 12 week visit (MV4) of the Maintenance Treatment 
Phase.  
 
 Statistical Analysis Plan      
  Page 9 (34) 
 
Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Final 2017 -11-2 Study:  CTH -300 
 A full “ON” response is defined as a period of time where in the judgment of the patient the medication 
is providing full benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness, slowness and other PD features comparable 
to or better than that obtained with their standard dose of oral levodopa and other anti-parkinsonian 
medications prior to beginning the study. 
An assessment of the “OFF”/”ON” state will be performed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes after 
dosing at each visit. Patients will also be asked if they attained a full “ON” state anytime within 30 
minutes of dosing. This endpoint will be based on the latter question (did the patient attain a full “ON” 
state anytime within 30 minutes of dosing). However, if this question has not been completed but the 
patient reported the “OFF”/”ON” state at 15 and/or 30 minutes, the 15 and 30 minute assessments will 
be used to derive the endpoint. In this case, if the patient has reported an ”ON” state at either of the two 
time points the patient will be considered as having the full “ON” response within 30 minutes after 
dosing. The visits at which there is no 15 or 30 minute assessment of the “OFF”/”ON” state and the 
question about attaining a full “ON” state anytime within 30 minutes of dosing is missing will be set as 
having a missing value. 
5.3 Other secondary endpoints  
1. The percentage of instances where a full “ON” response was achieved at 30 minutes after self-
administration of study medication based on the home dosing diary entries during the 2 days 
prior to the 12 week visit (MV4).  
During the Maintenance Treatment Phase of the study, patient s will complete the home dosing 
diary on the 2 days prior to their next scheduled in-clinic visit. The patients will self-administer 
their doses of randomized treatment (APL-130277 or placebo; 1:1 ratio) in order to treat up to 5 
“OFF” episodes per day. The patients will fill in the time when study treatment is self-
administered and the “ON”/”OFF” status at 30 minutes following dosing. In total, each patient 
can record up to 10 episodes at 3 visits after the randomization (MV2, MV3 and MV4), i.e. a 
total of up to 30 episodes. For each patient, the percentage of episodes in which the full “ON” 
response was achieved at 30 minutes out of all recorded episodes will be calculated. In case the 
time of self-administration has been recorded but the corresponding “ON”/”OFF” status is 
missing, the status will be classified as “OFF”. The percentages calculated separately for each 
patient will be used as response variables in the statistical analysis. For patients who did not 
record any episodes during the Maintenance Treatment Phase, the endpoint will be set as 
missing. 
2. Mean change from pre-dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score at 15, 45, 60 and 90 minutes at the 
12 week visit (MV4) of the Maintenance Treatment Phase.  
These variable will be defined using rules similar to the primary endpoint. 
3. Time (in minutes) from dosing to when study medication is starting to provide an “ON” effect 
at the 12 week visit (MV4) of the Maintenance Treatment Phase.   
 
 Statistical Analysis Plan      
  Page 10 (34) 
 
Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Final 2017 -11-2 Study:  CTH -300 
 The time from dosing until the patient reports to have an effect will be used as the endpoint. For 
patients who do not report an effect during the follow-up period, the data will be censored at 90 
minutes.  
4. Percent of patient s with a patient-rated full “ON” response within 30 minutes, whose duration 
from time when study medication begins to have an effect until their “OFF” (if applicable) lasts 
for at least 30 minutes at the 12 week visit (MV4) of the Maintenance Treatment Phase. 
The identification of patients who experienced a full “ON” response within 30 minutes will be 
defined as identical to that for the key secondary endpoint. Duration of the response will be 
calculated by evaluating the difference in time from the “Time to when study treatment started 
to have an effect as per subject assessments” and the “Time to OFF” per patient assessment. If 
the latter question is left blank or marked as “N/A”, time “OFF” will be identified as per the 
Patient confirmation of “OFF” and “ON” following dosing at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes 
after dosing. If the patient did not turn “OFF” after dosing, duration will be assumed to have 
ended at 90 minutes after dosing. For a blank value or “N/A” ticked for the question “Time to 
when study medication started to have an effect as per subject assessment”, the data will be 
treated as having a missing value.   Patients who do not turn “ON” or who turn “ON”, but with a 
durati
on less than 30 minutes will be considered non-responders in this analysis.   
5. Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) post dosing. 
The non-missing values will be categorized as improvements (very much improved, much 
improved, minimally improved) or non-improvements (no change, minimally worse, much 
worse, very much worse). The missing values will be considered as non-improvements.  CGI 
seve
rity (CGI-S) will also be assessed. 
6. Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) post dosing. 
The non-missing values will be categorized as improvements (very much improved, much 
improved, minimally improved) or non-improvements (no change, minimally worse, much 
worse, very much worse). The missing values will be considered as non-improvements.  PGI 
severity (PGI-S) will also be assessed. 
7. Mean change from baseline in Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) summary index 
score.  
Change from SV to MV4 in PDQ-39 sub-scores (mobility score, activities of daily living, bodily 
discomfort score, emotional wellbeing score, social support score, communication score, 
cognitive impairment score, and stigma score) and summary index score will be calculated. The 
questionnaire provides scores on eight dimensions as outlined below: 
 mobility (10 items, #1 to 10)  
 activities of daily living (6 items, #11 to 16)  
 emotional well-being (6 items, #17 to 22)  
 
 Statistical Analysis Plan      
  Page 11 (34) 
 
Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Final 2017 -11-2 Study:  CTH -300 
  stigma (4 items, #23 to 26) 
 social support (3 items, #27 to 29)  
 cognitions (4 items, #30 to 33)  
 communication (3 items, #34 to 36)  
 bodily discomfort (3 items, #37 to 39).  
Items are scored from 0 (never) to 4 (always).  Dimension scores are obtained by dividing the 
sum of the item scores by the maximum possible score for any given dimension and expressing 
this as a percentage.  For example: 
 mobility = (sum of scores of #1 to 10)/(4 x 10) x 100 
 activities of daily living = (sum of scores of #11 to 16)/(4 x 6) x 100 . 
For social support, if the response indicates that a patient does not have a spouse or partner for 
#28, social support can be calculated as [(sum of scores of #27 and 29)/(4 x 2) x 100]. 
A summary index is then calculated as the sum of the total score of the dimensions divided by 
the number of dimensions, i.e. (sum of dimension scores / 8). If any item score is missing, the 
relevant dimension score and the summary index will be missing. 
8. Change from baseline in MDS-UPDRS – Part II: Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living. 
The change from SV to MV4 in MDS-UPDRS Part II score will be evaluated. The MDS-
UPDRS Part II score will be calculated as the sum of the individual items of the MDS- UPDRS 
Part II questionnaire (items 2.1 – 2.13). Missing individual items will not be imputed. If there is 
at least 1 missing item, the corresponding MDS-UPDRS Part II score will be set as missing. 
9. Evaluation of safety and tolerability data collected, including 12-lead ECGs, orthostatic 
hypotension, oropharyngeal and dopaminergic AEs. 
The evaluation of the safety and tolerability data is described in section 15 of this document. 
5.4 Other subject -reported s econdary  endpoints  
1. Change in sleep measures on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).  
The ESS is used to determine the level of daytime sleepiness and evaluated as change from SV 
to MV4 .  There are 8 situations listed for which patient s rate their likelihood of dozing or 
sleeping (0=no chance of dozing, 1=slight chance of dozing, 2=moderate chance of dozing, and 
3=high chance of dozing ). The total score is the sum of 8 item scores and can range between 0 
and 24. In case of missing item scores, the missing value will be replaced by the average of non-
missing scores at the same visit from the same patient. In case all item scores are missing, the 
total score will be set as missing. The higher total score indicates the higher level of daytime 
sleepiness. A score of 10 or more is considered sleepy, and a score of 18 or more is very sleepy.

 2. Change in European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D).  
The EQ-5D is a utility scale consisting of three components: health state dimensions, health 
state thermometer scale and health state index. 
The health state dimensions will be described by the 5 dimensions of the EQ-5D (mobility, self-
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 response 
choices, listed in order of increasing severity. The health state dimensions will be evaluated by 
presenting the distribution of responses separately for each of the 5 dimensions. 
The health state thermometer scale asks respondents to rate their present health status on a 0 to 
100 visual analog scale (VAS). The change from SV to MV4 on the VAS scores will be 
evaluated. 
The health state index score will be calculated based on EQ -5D-5L Crosswalk Index Value Calculator - 
EuroQol, using the dimension scores from the 5 dimensions, ranging between 1.0 (best imaginable 
hea
lth) and -0.594 (worst imaginable health).  
6 Sample size considerations  
The study intends to show the superiority of APL-130277 compared with placebo. Assuming a 
treatment difference of 7 points and standard deviation of 10 points, a sample size of 44 subjects per 
group or 88 patients for two groups will provide ≥ 90% power to detect a statistically significant 
difference at the 0.05 level (2-sided), using a two-sample t-test. Taking into consideration a 10% 
dropout rate during the titration phase and a 15% dropout rate during the maintenance phase, the study 
plans to enroll approximately 126 patients into the Dose Titration Phase and to randomize 
approximately 114 patients into the Maintenance Treatment Phase. 
7 Statistical hypotheses  
The primary objective of this study is to show that APL-130277  is superior to placebo in improving the 
motor function, assessed as the mean change from pre-dose in Movement Disorders Society (MDS) 
Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III Motor Examination (MDS-UPDRS 
MOTOR) score at 30 minutes after dosing at the 12 week visit (MV4) of the Maintenance Treatment 
Phase. That is, the null-hypothesis to be tested is 
H0:  APL-130277  is the same as  placebo in its effect on the motor function  
against the two-sided alternative 
H1:  Either of the treatment groups is superior to the other in its effect on the motor  function .

 8 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be used for the analysis of the disposition and efficacy and 
safety data. 
8.1 All Available population  
The All Available Population ( AAP ) will include all patients who have consented for the study, 
including screening failures. Unless specified otherwise, the AAP will be used for patient listings and 
for the summary of patient disposition. 
8.2 Modified Intention -To-Treat population  
All patients who are randomized and  receive at least one post-randomization dose of study medication 
(APL-130277 or placebo) will comprise the modified Intention- To-Treat (mITT) population. The mITT 
population will be used for the efficacy analysis, and patients will be grouped according to the 
randomized treatment group. 
8.3 Intention -To-Treat population  
All patients who are randomized will comprise the Intention- To-Treat (ITT) population and patient s 
will be grouped according to the randomized treatment group. 
8.4 Safety population  
All patients who are enrolled and receive at least one dose of APL-130277 during the Dose Titration 
Phase will be included in the safety population. The Safety population will be used for the analysis of 
the safety endpoints from the Dose Titration Phase and for the pooled data from Dose Titration Phase 
and Maintenance Treatment Phase.  
8.5 Maintenance Phase Safety population  
All patient s who receive at least one dose of study medication (APL-130277 or placebo) during the 
Maintenance Treatment Phase will comprise the Maintenance Phase Safety population. The 
Maintenance Phase Safety population will be used for the analysis of the safety endpoints from the 
Maintenance Treatment Phase.  The patients will be grouped according to the medication actually 
received (APL-130277 or placebo) during the Maintenance Phase.  In cases where the patient received 
at 
least one dose of both APL-130277 and placebo, they will be grouped into the APL-130277 arm for 
safety analysis.

Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Final 2017 -11-2 Study:  CTH -300 
 8.6 Completer population  
All mITT patients who have a valid MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score at pre-dose and after 30 minutes 
post-dose at baseline and MV4. 
8.7 Per Protocol population  
All mITT patients who complete the study with no major protocol deviation.  
9 General statistical considerations  
All data from all patients entered into the database will be included in patient data listings. The listings 
will be generally sorted by center and patient number (and by visit and by time point, if applicable), 
unless specified otherwise.  
All applicable data will be summarized separately for  the Dose Titration Phase , Maintenance Treatment 
Phase  and for the pooled data from the Dose Titration Phase  and Maintenance Treatment Phase . The 
Maintenance Treatment Phase  data will be summarized by treatment group (APL -130277 or placebo) . 
Selected analyses will be performed based on the dose required to achieve  a full “ON” response (see 
Section 9.5 for more details) . Where appropriate, data will be summarized by visit and/or time point . 
Screening visit (SV) assessments may be performed at either SV1 or SV2.   If performed at both visits, 
the latter assessment wil l be used as the SV assessment for the purposes of analysis.  Unscheduled or 
repeat assessments will not be included in summary tables, but will be included in listings.   
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations (n), mean, standard 
deviation ( SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Standard error of the mean (SEM) will also be 
provided for summaries of efficacy data, if relevant.  
Descriptive statistics for categorical data will include frequency counts and percents. The total number 
of patients in the treatment group (N) will be used as the denominator for percent calculations, unless 
stated  otherwise.  
Significance testing will be 2-sided using α = 0.05, unless otherwise specified.  
All statistical analyses and summaries will be produced using SAS version 9.3 or higher. Deviations 
from the statistical plan will be reported in the clinical study report, including the rationale for use. 
9.1 Adjustment for covariates  
For the analysis of efficacy endpoints, the baseline value of the endpoint in question will generally be 
included as a baseline covariate (for continuous endpoints) or as a stratification factor (for categorical 
endpoints), if available.  Use of covariates for statistical adjustment is discussed below where relevant.

 9.2 Handling of drop -outs or missing data  
 
Several different methods to handle the missing data in efficacy assessments will be used. 
 For the primary efficacy analysis, likelihood-based modeling approach will be used to handle 
incomplete data. For this purpose, Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) will be 
applied, see Section 14.1 . 
 Sensitivity analysis for primary efficacy data will be conducted using the Multiple Imputation 
(MI) approach, i.e. by replacing each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent 
the uncertainty about the right value to impute.  LOCF will also be used for sensitivity analysis 
(see Section 14.1).  
Safety data will not be subject to any imputation and will be summarized on an observed case basis. 
9.3 Interim analyses  and data monitoring  
No interim analyses of the efficacy data are foreseen. The safety data will be monitored during the study 
conduct by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to determine if safety 
monitoring can be modified. The responsibilities of the DSMB include: 
 Monitor safety and study conduct; 
 On a regular basis, review unblinded summaries of demographic, patient disposition, study 
conduct and safety data (provided by an independent statistician); 
 Evaluate results of an analysis performed after 50% patients have completed the Dose Titration 
Phase to determine if it is safe and appropriate to reduce the extent of safety evaluations during 
titration, and to make recommendations for amending the protocol. 
The full responsibilities and purview of the DSMB are outlined in the DSMB Charter , which w as 
approved by the Sponsor prior to the implementation of any DSMB review (see Section 17.4.7 of the 
Protocol).  
9.4 Multiple comparison/multiplicity  
The multiplicity due to multiple efficacy endpoints will be addressed by using a hierarchical testing 
approach.  
The 
primary and secondary endpoints will be tested in a fixed sequential manner.   The order of the 
testing is outlined below.  See Section 5  for the definition of the primary and secondary endpoints. 
1. Primary endpoint: Mean change from pre-dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score after 30 minutes at 
MV4 
2. Key secondary endpoint: percentage of patients with a patient-rated full “ON” response within 30 
minutes at MV4

Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Final 2017 -11-2 Study:  CTH -300 
 3. Percent of patients with a patient-rated full “ON” response within 30 minutes, whose duration from 
time when study medication begins to have an effect until their “OFF” (if applicable) lasts for at 
least 30 minutes at MV4 
4. Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI): The percentage of patients improved (ie, very 
much improved, much improved or minimally improved) at MV4 
5. Clinician Global Impression of Improvement (CGI): The percentage of patients improved (i.e., very 
much improved, much improved or minimally improved) at MV4 
6. Mean change from SV to MV4 in MDS-UPDRS – Part II: Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily 
Living 
7. The percentage of instances where a full “ON” response was achieved at 30 minutes after self-
administration of study treatment in the outpatient setting based on the home dosing diary entries 
during the 2 days prior to MV4 
8. Mean change from SV to MV4 in PDQ-39 summary index score 
9. Mean change from pre-dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score at 15 minutes at MV4 
10. Time (in minutes) to when study medication is starting to have an effect at MV4 
 
First, the endpoint ranked as first will be tested and the difference will be declared statistically 
significant if the nominal p-value is less than 0.05.  Second, in case that the difference for the first 
endpoint is statistically significant, the endpoint ranked as second will be tested, and the difference will 
be declared statistically significant if the nominal p-value is less than 0.05.  The testing will continue as 
long as the previously ranked endpoint was statistically significant.  
In case all endpoints are not evaluated as a part of the hierarchical testing procedure, the statistical tests 
will be reported in any case and interpreted in a descriptive manner 
9.5 Examination of subgroups  
At least the following subgroup analyses have been pre-planned.  The subgroup analyses are considered 
exploratory and will be performed for selected efficacy endpoints (at least the primary endpoint) and for 
adverse events (except the subgroups based on MDS-UPDRS Motor scores). Selected baseline data will 
be 
presented for the subgroups as well.   Subgroups with too few patient s per treatment arm (e.g. less 
than 4) may not be analysed. 
 Patients with the baseline MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score  (at the last titration visit at which the 
randomized dose is given up through TV6) less than or equal to the median versus the patients with 
the baseline score above the median   
 Patients with the change from pre-dose to 30 minutes post-dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score at 
baseline less than or equal to the median versus the patients with the change score above the median   
 Non-elderly (< 65 years) versus elderly (≥ 65 years) patients

Demographic characteristics and other baseline data will also be summarized by subgroups as defined 
in section 9.5 of this document  
Baseline is defined as the last observed value before the first dose in titration phase, unless specified 
otherwise. 
12 Concomitant medication/treatment  
All medications will be classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification 
codes and preferred drug names from the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD).  
Medications with a stop date before the first date of study drug dosing will be considered prior 
medications. Medications with start date or stop date on or after the first date of study drug dosing will 
be considered concomitant medications. The prior and concomitant medications will be summarized 
separately. 
Summaries of prior and concomitant PD treatment medications (medications which start with ATC 
code N04) will be presented in tabular form using the ATC Level 4 and preferred term. Other prior and 
concomitant medications will be presented in tabular form using the ATC Level 1, ATC Level 2, and 
Preferred Term (PT). Frequencies and percentages of patients receiving medications will be presented 
by treatment group and overall. The tables will be sorted by overall descending frequency of ATC 
Level(s) and then, within an ATC Level, by overall descending frequency of PT. 
If the medication start date is incomplete, then it will be imputed as follows for the purpose of 
determining concomitant use:  
 If the start date is completely missing, the start date will be equal to the first dose date. 
However, if the stop date is not missing and is before the first dose date, then the stop date will 
be used instead.  
 
 Statistical Analysis Plan      
  Page 20 (34) 
 
Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Final 2017 -11-2 Study:  CTH -300 
  If the start day is missing: Check if month is same as month of first dose date of study treatment. 
If yes, impute to first dose date of study treatment; else impute First day of the month. 
 However, if the stop date is not missing and is before the date of the first dose of study 
treatment or the imputed start date, then the stop date will be used instead. If the start day and 
month are missing: Check if year is same as the year of the first dose date of study treatment. If 
yes, impute to first dose date of study treatment; else impute to first day of the first month 
(January).  
However, if the stop date is not missing and is before the date of the first dose of study treatment or the 
imputed start date, then the stop date will be used instead. If the medication stop date is partial, then it 
will be imputed as follows for the purpose of determining concomitant use:  
 If the stop date is completely missing and the medication is not ongoing, the stop date will be 
equal to the last dose date or date of completion/withdrawal, whichever is the latest.  
 If the stop day is missing, the last day of the month will be used. If resulted imputed stop date is 
after the latest of last dose date or date of completion/withdrawal, then the latest of last dose 
date or date of completion/withdrawal will be used.  
 If the stop day and month are missing, then the last day of the last month (December) will be 
used. If resulted imputed stop date is after the latest of last dose date or date of 
completion/withdrawal, then the latest of last dose date or date of completion/withdrawal will 
be used.  
In addition, the total daily levodopa dose (mg) will be summarized at baseline (PD medications 
reported by the patient as ongoing at first dose in titration phase will be added to calculate total daily 
dose) with descriptive statistics. 
The summary of concomitant medications will be done for the mITT and Safety population. 
13 Medical history  
Medical history data will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
The medical history data will be summarized with frequencies and percentages of patients with at least 
one medical history item, and patient frequencies and percentages on the System Organ Class (SOC) 
and PT levels. The number of events will also be summarized. The table will be sorted by overall 
descending frequency of SOC and then, within a SOC, by overall descending frequency of PT.  
PD history (time since diagnosis of PD measured in years at time of first dose at TV1, presence of a rest 
tremor at the time of diagnosis, time since onset of motor fluctuations, type of OFF episodes 
experienced, number of OFF episodes/day, typical length of OFF episodes) 
The summary of medical and PD history data will be done for the mITT and Safety population.

 14 Analysis of efficacy  
14.1 Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study is the mean change from pre-dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score 
after 30 minutes at 12 weeks (MV4). The difference between APL-130277 and placebo at MV4 will be 
estimated using a MMRM. The model will include the observed change from pre-dose MDS-UPDRS 
MOTOR score values after 30 minutes at MV1, MV2, MV3 and MV4 as the response values (i.e., no 
imputation will be done). The treatment difference at 12 weeks will be estimated using contrasts. The 
MMRM model will include the treatment group (APL-130277 or placebo), visit (MV1, MV2, MV3 and 
MV4) and the interaction between the treatment group and visit as fixed factors. The change from pre-
dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score after 30 minutes at the last titration visit at which the randomized 
dose is given up through TV6 will be used as a baseline covariate in the model.  
An unstructured covariance structure will be applied for MMRM. In case the model will not converge 
with the unstructured covariance structure, the heterogeneous Toeplitz structure (TOEPH) will be used 
instead. In case the model will not converge with the heterogeneous Toeplitz structure, heterogeneous 
compound symmetry (CSH) will be used instead. The denominator degrees of freedom will be 
computed using the Kenward-Roger method. 
The least square (LS) mean, standard error, and LS mean difference between APL-130277 and placebo 
group at MV4 along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) will be provided. The P-value for the 
hypothesis testing will also be provided. Treatment difference will be assessed with a 2-sided alpha 
level of 0.05, unless specified otherwise.  The SAS code planned for the analysis is outlined below. 
 
proc mixed data=&data; 
class trtp avisit usubjid; 
model chgpre=basepre trtp avisit trtp*avisit / ddfm=kr; 
repeated avisit / subject=usubjid(trtp) type=un; 
lsmeans trtp*avisit / cl; 
run; 
The mITT population will be used for the primary efficacy analysis. Observed and change from pre-
dose MDS-UPDRS MOTOR scores will be summarized by visit and time point for the mITT 
population as well. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed for factors defined in section 9.5 of this document. Each subgroup 
will be analyzed separately using the same methods as in the primary analysis. In addition, for each of 
the subgroup factors, a MMRM model similar to the primary model will be used, including additional 
fixed factors for the subgroup variable and the interaction between the treatment group and subgroup 
variable. The influence of each subgroup factor will be investigated using the p-value for the interaction 
term calculated with this model.

 14.1.1 Patient Global Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
The following sensitivity analyses will be performed for the primary endpoint. 
 Completer analysis: The analysis as specified above will be repeated for the Completer Population.  
 Per Protocol analysis : The analysis as specified above will be repeated for the Per Protocol 
Population. 
 MI analysis with Missing At Random assumption:  MI techniques based on Pattern Mixture Models 
(PMM) will be applied as a sensitivity analysis in the mITT population. This methodology will 
structure data based on missing data patterns. The method will be based on a missingness pattern 
having a monotone structure, i.e. if among the observations over time one data value is missing, all 
other values after this missing value will also be treated as missing.  For patients with intermittent 
missing values, before performing MI based on the PMM, it will be necessary to create a monotone 
missingness pattern.  Intermittent missing values will be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte 
Carlo (MCMC) methodology which assumes a multivariate normal distribution over all variables 
included in the imputation model. The MI procedure in SAS will be used for this purpose and this 
first MI step is planned to be repeated 100 times, creating several different datasets with a 
monotone missing data structure.  Seed value of 201507 will be used in the MI procedure.  The 
imputation is based on the missing at random (MAR) assumption, i.e. the missing data are assumed 
to follow the same model as the other patients in their respective treatment arm. 
After this, the remaining missing data can be imputed using a method for monotone missingness, 
also based on the MAR assumption. Thus, for each of the created datasets with a monotone missing 
data pattern, the MI procedure in SAS will be used to impute missing values based on a sequential 
procedure reflecting the monotone missing data pattern. Patients with the first missing value 
occurring at MV1 will have their missing MV1 value replaced by an imputed value from a 
regression model with treatment group and the change from pre-dose MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score 
at baseline as explanatory variables. In the next step, patients with their MV2 value missing will 
have their missing MV2 value replaced by an imputed value from a regression model with 
treatment group, the change from pre-dose MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score at baseline and the MV1 
value as explanatory variables.  Similar procedure will be used to replace the missing values at 
MV3 and MV4.  
The imputed datasets generated with the approach described above do contain only non-missing 
values and are used as input in the model for the sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint. 
MMRM models similar as described above will thus be run on each of the generated imputed 
datasets and the difference between the treatment groups at MV4 will be estimated. The MMRM 
model will be similar to the primary analysis. Finally, the MIANALYZE procedure in SAS will be 
applied to combine the results from these several datasets to derive an overall estimate of the 
treatment difference at MV4. In addition to the estimates, corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
and p-values will be calculated.

  MI analysis with Missing Not At Random assumption (Placebo group based imputation):  Another 
MI analysis will be performed with the assumption that the data is not missing at random. Placebo 
group based assumption will be used, i.e. the trajectories of the patients are assumed to follow the 
placebo group after the discontinuation. Methods similar to the procedure described above will be 
used in the mITT population. However, the missing values will be imputed using Placebo based 
imputation. 
 MI analysis with Missing Not At Random assumption (Tipping point based imputation):  If the 
primary analysis significantly favors APL-130277, another MI analysis will be performed in the 
mITT population with the assumption that the data in the APL-130277 group is not missing at 
random. A tipping point based assumption will be used, i.e. the trajectories of the patients in the 
APL-130277  group after withdrawal are assumed to be worse by an amount of delta. After the MI 
using the MAR assumption, as defined above has been done, the amount of delta will be added to 
each imputed value in the APL-130277 group. Successively harsher deltas will be imposed on the 
imputed values in the APL-130277  group, starting with a UPDRS increment (worsening) of 0.5 
points. The delta is further increased in the steps of 0.5 points (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, …) until the statistical 
significance is lost, i.e. until the p-value becomes >0.05.  For the placebo group, the MI using MAR 
assumption will be used. 
 Comparability of the pre-dose values:  The primary endpoint is defined as the change from the pre-
dose value of the corresponding day.  This definition is based on the assumption that the study 
treatment does not influence the pre-dose values during the study. This assumption will be 
investigated by tabulating the pre-dose values by visit and treatment group with descriptive 
statisti cs in the mITT population.  
 Last observation carried forward (LOCF):  In this analysis, the missing values will be replaced by 
the previous visit change values at the 30 min post-dose time point carried forward. The LOCF-
imputed values at each visit will be compared using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model 
with treatment group as a fixed factor. The change from pre-dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score 
after 30 minutes at the last titration visit at which the randomized dose is given up through TV6 will 
be used as a covariate in the model. This analysis will be performed in the mITT population. 
Similarly, the pre-dose values corresponding to the change values will be carried forward for the 
purpose of summarizing the data with descriptive statistics. 
 Responder analysis based on the MDS-UPDRS MOTOR scores. Response is defined as an 
improvement of at least 30% decrease in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score from the pre-dose value at 
15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes. The number and proportion of responders at each time point and the 
cumulative number and proportion of patients having responded at least once by each time point 
will be tabulated with descriptive statistics at each visit. 
14.1.2 Graphical summaries of the primary endpoint 
The following graphs will be generated using the estimates calculated with the MMRM:

  Estimated mean changes (with SEM) from pre-dose to 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes by treatment 
group. Separate graph will be produced for each visit (MV1, MV2, MV3 and MV4). The x-axis 
includes the time of the assessment (15, 30, 45, 60 or 90 minutes) and the y-axis the change from 
pre-dose. LS means estimates and SEMs of these estimates from the primary MMRM will be used 
for the display.

x-axis includes the visit (MV1, MV2, MV3 or MV4) and the y-axis the change from pre-dose. 
14.2 Key Secondary endpoint  
The key secondary endpoint, percentage of patients with a patient-rated full “ON” response within 30 
minutes at MV4 will be analyzed in the mITT population using the GLIMMIX procedure for binomial 
data with logit link.  This analysis will use the observed values from MV1, MV2, MV3 and MV4 
without any imputation as the response. The model will include the treatment group (APL -130277 or 
placebo), visit (MV1, MV2, MV3 and MV4) and the interaction between the treatment group and visit 
as fixed factors. The “ON/OFF” assessment at the last titration visit at which the randomized dose is 
given up through TV6  will be used as a covariate.   An unstructured covariance structure will be used  
for the repeated measures . In case the model  will not converge with the unstructured covariance 
structure, the heterogeneous Toeplitz structure  (TOEPH) will be used instead. In case the model will 
not converge with the heterogeneous Toeplitz structure , heterogeneous compound symmetry (CSH)  
will be used instead.  The odds ratio (APL -130277 vs. Placebo), 95% confidence intervals for the odds 
ratio and p -value wi ll be provided.  
The sas code planned for this analysis is  
 
Proc glimmix data=&data;

As a sensitivity analysis, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the “ON/OFF” assessment 
within 30 minutes at the last titration visit  at which randomized dose given . In case of missing data at 
MV4, the patient  is considered as not reaching the full “ON”. The p ercentage of patient s with a patient -
rated full “ON” response  at each visit (MV1, MV2, MV3, MV4) and time point ( 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 
minutes) will also be summarized descriptively by treatment group.  The analysis will be conducted in 
the mITT population.

 14.2.1 Graphical summaries of percent of patients with patient-rated full “ON” 
The following graphs will be generated for the percentage of patients with a patient -rated full “ON” 
response, as defined above : 
 Percentage of patients with a patient -rated full “ON” response  at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes by 
treatment group. Separate graph will be produced for each visit (MV1, MV2, MV3 and MV4). The 
x-axis includes the time of the assessment (15, 30, 45, 60 or 90 minutes) and the y -axis the 
proportion of patient s. 
 Cumulative number of patients with a patien t-rated full “ON” response  within  15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 
minutes by treatment group. Separate graph will be produced for each visit (MV1, MV2, MV3 and 
MV4). The x -axis includes the tim e of the assessment (15, 30, 45, 60 or  90 minutes ) and the y -axis 
the cumulative proportion of patient s reaching the response at least once by the time point.  
 Percentage of patients with a patient -rated full “ON” response  at 30 minutes  by treatment group. 
The x -axis includes the visit (MV1, MV2, MV3 or M V4) and the y -axis the proportion of patient s.  
14.3 Other secondary  endpoints  
All the secondary endpoints defined below will be analyzed in mITT population. 
1. The percentage of instances where a full “ON” response was achieved at 30 minutes after self-
administration of study medication based on the home dosing diary entries.  
The percentages calculated separately for each patient for each visit (2 days prior to each visit) for 
the period between MV2 and MV4 (1 value per subject per visit ) will be used as response variables 
in the statistical analysis. The percentage values will be compared between APL-130277 and 
placebo using a MMRM similar to the one used for the primary endpoint.   
2. Mean change from pre-dose in MDS-UPDRS MOTOR score at 15, 45, 60 and 90 minutes at the 12 
week visit (MV4) of the Maintenance Treatment Phase.  
These endpoints will be analyzed using a model similar to the MMRM used for the primary 
endpoint with corresponding timepoint for the covariate.  
3. Time (in minutes) to when study medication is starting to have an effect at the 12 week visit (MV4) 
of the Maintenance Treatment Phase.  
This variable will be analyzed as a time- to-event endpoint. The time to effect at MV4 will be 
described using the Kaplan-Meier method, including the estimate of the median time to effect and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. In case the median time cannot be estimated in both 
treatment groups, the time to 25% of the patients having an effect will be estimated additionally. 
Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier estimates at 5, 10, 15, … minutes will be summarized by 5 minute 
increments.. However, time points beyond 60 minutes will not be summarized. Cox proportional 
hazards model with treatment group as a factor will be used to compare APL-130277 and placebo .

 The difference will be estimated with a hazard ratio along with a 95% CI for the hazard ratio. For 
the patients with missing data at MV4, the last available observation from visits MV1, MV2 or 
MV3 will be used instead.  If all visits, MV1 – MV4, are miss ing, the patient  will be considered 
censored at 90 minutes for this analysis.  
4. Percent of patients with a patient-rated full “ON” response within 30 minutes, whose duration from 
time when study medication begins to have an effect until their “OFF” (if applicable) lasts for at 
least 30 minutes at the 12 week visit (MV4) of the Maintenance Treatment Phase.  
This endpoint will be analyzed using similar methods as used for the key secondary endpoint 
including the sensitivity analysis.  
5. Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) post dosing. 
The proportions of patients who improved (defined as very much improved, much improved or 
minimally improved ) will be tabulated by treatment group and visit. This summary will be 
complemented by the distribution of each response category (very much improved, much improved, 
minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse) tabulated by the 
treatment group and visit based on the observed results.  The difference between APL-130277 and 
placebo at MV4 in patients who improved versus did not improve will be analyzed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the CGI-S assessment at MV1.  In case the distribution 
of the CGI-S assessment at MV1 is skewed, categories will be combined (e.g. category 1-3 vs 4 vs 
5-7). 
6. Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) post dosing. 
This endpoint will be analyzed with methods similar to those used for CGI-I and proportion of 
patients who improved will be defined in a similar way. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel will be 
stratified by the PGI-S assessment at MV1.  The PGI-S assessment at MV1 will be used to stratify 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and categorized, if needed using approach similar to CGI- S. 
7. Change from baseline in Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). 
The PDQ-39  summary index will be analyzed with methods similar to those used for  the primary 
endpoint  with the exception of using the PDQ -39 score at SV as the baseline covariate . In addition, 
the sub -scores will be summarized wi th descriptive statistics.  
8. Mean change from baseline in MDS-UPDRS – Part II: Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily 
Living.  
This endpoint will be analyzed at MV4 with an ANCOVA model with treatment group as a fixed 
factor and the baseline (Screening Visit) value as a covariate. 
In addition to the part II score, each categorical question of MDS-UPDRS – Part IV (q4.1 Time 
Spent with Dyskinesias, q4.2 Functional Impact of Dyskinesias, q4.3 Time Spent in the OFF State, 
q4.4 Functional Impact of Fluctuations, q4.5 Complexity of Motor Fluctuations, q4.6 Painful OFF 
State Dystonia; each questions scored from 0 to 4) will be tabulated separately, question by 
question. Both the distribution of categories and the categorical change from baseline (Screening

  Page 27 (34) 
 
Sponsor:  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Final 2017 -11-2 Study:  CTH -300 
 Visit), categorized as improved, no change or worsened will be tabulated. In addition, the % of 
Dyskinesia time, % of OFF time and % of Dystonia time collected on the Part IV questionnaire will 
be summarized with descriptive statistics, both as absolute values and as changes from baseline. 
14.4 Other  patient -reported  endpoints  
1. Change in sleep measures on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).  
The changes from SV to MV1, MV2, MV3, and MV4 in the total ESS score will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics. In addition, the proportion of patients who are sleepy (score of 10 or 
more) or very sleepy (score of 18 or more) will be tabulated. 
2. Change in European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D).  
The distribution of responses for the health state dimensions will be tabulated. The changes from 
SV to MV1, MV2, MV3, and MV4 in health state thermometer scale and health state index score 
will be tabulated with descriptive statistics.  
15 Analysi s of safety and tolerability  
The population used for safety analyses will be the Safety Population and Maintenance Phase Safety 
Population. In general, the safety data will be presented separately for the Dose Titration Phase (where 
applicable, using the Safety Population) and for the Maintenance Treatment Phase (using the 
Maintenance Phase Safety Population). The safety analysis of the Dose Titration Phase will summarize 
the safety data for the total Safety population while the analysis of the Maintenance Treatment Phase 
will focus on the comparison of the APL-130277 treated patients versus placebo. In addition, separate 
summaries will be prepared for all patients receiving APL-130277 either during the Dose Titration 
Phase or Maintenance Treatment Phase by pooling the data from the two periods during the APL-
130277 exposure (using the Safety Population). 
15.1 Extent of exposure  
The following information will be summarized by treatment group (when applicable) and overall. In 
addition, these summaries will be broken down by the dose level of APL-130277 (10 mg, 15 mg, 20 
mg, 25 mg, 30 mg or 35 mg; see Section 9.5 ). 
 The number of patients exposed to study treatment, defined separately for the Dose Titration Phase 
(number of single dose exposure s will be derived ) and for the Maintenance Treatment Phase 
(repeated dose exposure) 
 The following summaries will be done only for the Maintenance Treatment Phase (repeated dose 
exposure)

  If the start date is completely missing, the start date will be equal to the date of the first dose of 
study treatment.  However, if the stop date is not missing and is before the date of the first dose of 
study treatment, then the stop date will be used instead.  
 If the start day is missing: Check if month is same as month of first dose date of study treatment. If 
yes, impute to first dose date of study treatment; else impute First day of the month. 
 However, if the stop date is not missing and is before the date of the first dose of study treatment or 
the imputed start date, then the stop date will be used instead. If the start day and month are 
missing: Check if year is same as the year of the first dose date of study treatment. If yes, impute to 
first dose date of study treatment; else impute to first day of the first month (January).  
However, if the stop date is not missing and is before the date of the first dose of study treatment or the 
imputed start date, then the stop date will be used instead.  
The original date and time will be shown on all listings of AEs.  Listings will be provided for all AEs, 
serious TEAEs, non-serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal, TEAEs leading to drug 
interruption, TEAEs leading to dose reduction, and AEs leading to deaths. The listings will display 
study day, calculated as the AE start date –  date of first dose in the relevant study phase (Dose Titration 
or Maintenance Treatment) + 1 for events occurring on or after the first dose in the Dose Titration 
phase, and as AE start date –  date of first dose in the Dose Titration phase for AEs occurring prior to 
the first dose in the Dose Titration Phase. 
TEAEs will be summarized by SOC and PT and by treatment group when applicable. TEAEs with 
onset after the last dose of the study treatment period are attributed to the treatment received during the 
treatment period. Both event and patient counts, where applicable, will be summarized. The counts will 
be complemented by percentages calculated for the patient counts unless otherwise specified.

as event and patient counts 
The tables will be sorted by overall descending frequency of SOC and then, within a SOC, by overall 
descending frequency of PT based on the patient count for the APL-130277  column. If only event count 
is presented, the sorting will be done based on the event count.  
Furthermore, the adverse events will also be summarized by subgroups (age, gender, race, country, dose 
level) as defined in section 9.5 of this document. In addition, the following tables will be summarized 
by dose: TEAEs,  Serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal, TEAEs leading to drug 
interruption, TEAEs leading to dose reduction, TEAEs leading to death,  and TEAEs of special interest.  
15.4 Laboratory s afety variables  
All clinical laboratory parameters will be converted to consistent units according to the International 
System of Units (SI) before summarization. The following will be summarized: 
 Numeric laboratory parameters: Actual values and change from baseline ( SV) to EOS, if applicable, 
for each parameter, will be summarized with descriptive statistics. 
 Laboratory parameters which have an upper or lower reference range: Number and percentage of 
patients with low, normal or high (i.e., below, within or above reference range) values at each visit 
for each parameter will be summarized 
o These values will be presented as a shift table, i.e. the distribution of the three response 
categories at EOS visit will be classified by the baseline ( SV) category.  
 Categorical laboratory parameters: The distribution of the categories will be summarized by visit. 
15.5 Vital signs  
Vital sign measurements include heart rate ( HR), respiratory rate ( RR), blood pressure ( BP) and body 
temperature.  Vital signs will be measured at all scheduled study visits at various time points after the 
patient has been in a supine position for 5 minutes. BP will also be measured within three minutes of 
standing at all time points. In addition to the vital signs captured on the Case Report Form, the standing

evaluated. 
The following summaries will be done: 
 Change from baseline ( SV) to other visit pre-dose values for each parameter (including the standing 
minus supine values). The change from baseline to the End of Study visit values will also be 
presented. 
 Actual values and change from pre-dose to post-dose, if applicable, at each visit for each parameter 
(including the standing minus supine values). 
Orthostatic hypotension will be defined as a reduction in systolic BP of 20 mmHg or more, or a 
reduction in diastolic BP of 10 mmHg or more, for the standing measurement compared to the supine 
measurement. The proportion of patients with orthostatic hypotension will be tabulated by visit and 
time point. 
15.6 ECG

screening and the median value will be used for summary purposes. 
The following summaries will be done: 
 Change from baseline ( SV) to other visit pre-dose values for each parameter. The change from 
baseline to the End of Study visit values will also be presented.  
 Actual values and change from pre-dose to post-dose, if applicable, at each visit for each parameter. 
The ECGs will be centrally read and deemed “Normal”, “Abnormal, not clinically significant” and 
“Abnormal, clinically significant” and most severe assessment will be tabulated by visit and time point.  
In addition, the QTc Intervals fulfilling the following criteria will be tabulated separately using 
Fridericia’s correction and Bazett’s correction: 
 Values >500 msec 
 Values increasing >15% from baseline if baseline value is ≥440 msec

 15.7 Other safety  variables  
 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a measure of suicidal ideation and behavior. 
The rating scale has 4 general categories: suicidal ideation, intensity of ideation, suicidal behavior, and 
actual attempts. All C-SSRS data will be listed. The frequency and percentage of patients with each 
response for suicidal ideation, intensity of ideation, and suicidal behavior items will be summarized as 
appropriate by treatment group and visit. 
 
The 
Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s d isease – Rating Scale (QUIP-
RS) is an instrument used to measure the extent of impulsive and compulsive behaviors in PD patients. 
The QUIP-RS consists of four questions which have to be answered for each disorder (gambling, sex, 
buying, eating, hobbyism, punding and PD medication use) o n a 5-point Likert scale. Scoring range for 
each scale (i.e. disorder) is 0– 16. The frequency and percentage of patients with positive response 
(“rarely” or higher) for each disorder will be summarized by treatment group and visit. Furthermore, the 
total Impulsive Control Disorder (ICD) score and the total QUIP-RS score will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics by treatment group and visit (both absolute values and changes from baseline). 
 
The frequency and percentage of patients with physical examination findings will be summarized by 
treatment group, visit, time point (when applicable) and body system. In addition, the frequency and 
percentage of patients with each type of oropharyngeal cavity examination finding will be summarized 
by treatment group, visit, time point (when applicable) and location. 
16 Other variables 
Major protocol deviations will be tabulated including the frequency and percentage of patients with 
each type of deviation by treatment group. Deviations considered major will be identified as such prior 
to study unblinding. Summaries will be based on the Enrolled Population and provided for the 
Screening Phase and  Dose Titration Phase.  Summaries will also be presented for ITT population for the 
Maintenance Treatment Phase. All other data collected but not specifically mentioned including the 
Zarit Burden Interview will be listed. 
17 Deviations from the analyses planned in the study protocol  
This analysis plan presents the planned analyses in more detail and several details and additional

randomized, receive at least one post-randomization dose of study treatment (APL-130277 or  placebo) 
and have efficacy data from at  least one post randomization evaluation will comprise the mITT 
population’ to “ All patient s who are randomized and receive at least one post -randomization dose of 
study treatment  (APL-130277  or plac ebo) will comprise the m odified Intention -To-Treat  (mITT) 
population.

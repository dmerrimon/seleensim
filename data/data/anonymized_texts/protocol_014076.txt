CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  Visit 1 (Day  1): Screening/Baseline.  The following will be obtained at this 
visit: signed written informed consent/assent (or re -consent/assent if 
washout period exceeds 45 days), c onfirmation of eligibility, medical 
history, demographics, review of concomitant medications and 
procedures/therapies, dermatologic exam, vital signs (with height and 
weight), a UPT for WOCBP, clinical evaluations (IGA and lesion counts), 
local skin reacti on (LSR) assessment, and standardized photography of the 
face. Qualified subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment 
groups (GDC 268, Reference Product, or GDC Vehicle). Randomization will 
be blocked from a centralized schedule and stratif ied by the number of non -
inflammatory lesions (≤70 / > 70) present at the Baseline visit. Subject kits 
will be dispensed according to the kit number assigned by an Interactive Web 
Response System (IWRS) as subjects are enrolled. Test article application 
will be demonstrated using the non -medicated samples provided to the site 
and, as part of training, the subject will apply the non -medicated sample in 
the clinic under staff supervision to ensure proper application. The subject 
will be instructed not to open  study supplies at the site. Test article will be 
dispensed along with application instructions, and a Subject Diary will be 
provided to document applied or missed doses. Subjects will be instructed to 
apply the test article twice daily, once in the mornin g and once in the 
evening, for 12 weeks with the first dose to be applied on the evening of the 
Baseline Visit. The subject will be scheduled for a follow -up telephone call.  
 
Visit 2 (Week 2): Follow -Up Telephone Call. The site staff will contact the 
subje ct to confirm the next visit appointment, review the Subject Diary and 
test article compliance, review of concomitant medications and 
procedures/therapies, and query the subject about AEs. The site staff will 
remind the subject to continue to apply test ar ticle twice daily, once in the 
morning and once in the evening and to bring all bottles (used and unused) 
of test article with him/her to the next clinic visit and to not apply test article 
or other products to the face within 4 hours of the next clinic vi sit. Subjects 
with tolerability issues or a material AE concern of any type may be seen for 
an in -office follow -up as an unscheduled visit at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
Visits 3 and 4 (Weeks 4 and 8): Follow -Up. The subject will return to the 
clinic for review of concomitant medications and procedures/therapies, 
LSRs, and AEs. Clinical evaluations (IGA and lesion counts) will be 
performed. The Subject Diary will be reviewed/collected/distributed as 
necessary and test article compliance will be rev iewed; the site staff will 
remind the subject to continue to apply test article twice daily, once in the 
morning and once in the evening, until the next clinic visit and to not apply 
test article or other products to the face within 4 hours of the next cli nic visit. 
Test article application will be demonstrated if deemed necessary. Test 
article accountability will be documented. The subject will be scheduled for 
the next visit.  
 
Visit 5 (Week 12): End of Study (EOS) or Early Termination (ET) . The 
subject wi ll return to the clinic for review of concomitant medications and 
procedures/therapies, LSRs, and AEs. A UPT for WOCBP and clinical 
evaluations (IGA and lesion counts) will be performed. The Subject Diary 
will be reviewed and test article compliance will b e reviewed. Test article

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  accountability will be documented; all test articles and subject diaries will 
be collected. The subject will exit the study.  
 
Unscheduled Visit.  The investigator may see the subject at an unscheduled 
visit to manage any AEs or LSRs  (if applicable). The subject will return to 
the clinic for review of concomitant medications and procedures/therapies, 
LSRs, and AEs. The Subject Diary and test article compliance will be 
reviewed. The subject’s next appointment will be confirmed.  
Study Measurements  Dosing Compliance:  
Measures of test article compliance will include the duration (days) of 
treatment (defined as last dose date – first dose date +1), the total number of 
applications applied and missed (determined from the doses reported in t he 
Subject Diary), and the percent of expected doses applied . A subject will be 
considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least 
75% and no more than 125% of the expected test article applications for the 
specified duration of t he study and does not miss the scheduled applications 
for more than 3 consecutive days.  
 
Efficacy and safety measurements will be assessed according to the schedule 
of events.  
 
Efficacy : 
Investigator’s Global Assessment  
Overall severity of acne will be ass essed using a five -point scale where 
0=Clear, 1=Almost Clear, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, and 4=Severe. This is a 
static morphological scale that refers to a point in time and not a comparison 
to Baseline.  
 
Acne Lesion Counts  
The number of non -inflammatory lesions  (open and closed comedones) and 
inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) on the face (including those 
present on the nose) will be counted. Counts of nodules and cysts will be 
reported separately and are not to be included in the inflammatory or non -
inflammatory lesion counts.  
 
Safety:  
Adverse Events  
All reported or observed AEs will be recorded. At each visit, subjects will 
also be questioned specifically about the status of any ongoing AEs. 
Untoward events that occur prior to the first dose of test ar ticle will be 
captured in the Medical History section of the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) unless they are related to a study -specific procedure.  
 
Local Skin Reactions  
At each visit, LSRs (erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, 
pruritus, erosion, and pain) will be assessed. Erythema, edema, 
scaling/dryness, and erosion will be assessed by the investigator and 
stinging/burning, pain, and pruritus will be assessed by the subject. 
Assessments will be made using a 4 -point ordinal scale where 0 =absent, 
1=mild (slight, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 
3=severe (marked, intense). Only LSRs that require medical intervention

Page 10 of 66 
 
CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  (e.g., prescription medication), require withholding or discontinuation of the 
application of the test  article, or extend 2  cm beyond the Treatment Area will 
be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded 
as an AE.  
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs including temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, and respiration r ate will be measured at Visit  1/Baseline. Assessments 
will be made after the subject has rested in a seated position for at least 5 
minutes. Height and weight will also be measured at Visit  1/Baseline.  
 
Urine Pregnancy Tests  
A UPT will be performed at Visi t 1/Baseline and at Visit 5/Week 12/EOS 
for WOCBP.  
Study Endpoints  Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints:  
 Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory 
(papules and pustules) lesion count.  
 Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non -inflammat ory 
(open and closed comedones) lesion count.  
 
Safety Endpoints:  
 Incidence (severity and causality) of any reported or observed 
treatment emergent AEs, whether or not they are considered to be 
related to the test article.  
 Number of subjects with improved/ same versus worsened 
severities compared to Baseline of the following LSRs: erythema, 
edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, pruritus, erosion, and 
pain at each onsite treatment visit.  
Sample Size 
Calculations  Based on the assumption of a 40% reduction  in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions counts for the Reference Product and a 38% reduction 
for GDC 268, 346 PP subjects per active arm will provide 85% probability 
of demonstrating therapeutic equivalence between the two active treatments 
at an alp ha=0.05 (two one -sided tests) with 90% confidence interval bounds 
of the ratio of means being 0.08 and 1.25. Assuming a 25% reduction in 
inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesions counts for the VEH, 231 mITT 
subjects in the VEH arm and 462 mITT subjects in  each of the active 
treatment arms will provide at least an 85% probability of demonstrating that 
each active treatment is statistically superior to vehicle treatment at a two -
sided alpha of 0.05. Therefore, approximately 1200 subjects will be enrolled 
using a 2:2:1 randomization ratio (GDC 268:Reference Product:VEH) to 
obtain a total of 1155 mITT subjects and 865 PP subjects.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® Version 9.4 unless 
otherwise stated.  
 
Study Population s: 
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who applied at least 
one dose of test article.

Page 11 of 66 
 
CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  The mITT population will include all randomized subjects who applied at least 
one dose of test article.  
 
The PP population will include all mITT subjects who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were compliant with the assigned test articles 
based on the subject diaries  (applied at least 75% and no more than 125% of 
the expected test article applications for the specified duration of the study), 
did not miss the scheduled test article applications for more than 3 consecutive 
days (i.e., 3 consecutive days with no test article application), have no other 
evidence of material dosing noncompliance,  and completed the primary 
endpoint evaluation at Week  12 within the designated visit window (Day 85 ± 
4 days) with no protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation 
including use of the prohibited medications .  
 
Subject randomization will be stratified by the number of non -inflammatory 
lesion s (≤70 / >70) present at the Baseline Visit in order to ensure balanced 
enrollment of subjects across the treatment groups by non -inflammatory 
lesion count. No subset analyses are planned based on baseline non -
inflammatory lesion counts.  
 
Dosing Compliance : 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize test article compliance for 
each analysis population. Compliant subjects are defined as those who apply 
at least 75% and no more than 125% of the expected test article applications, 
and did not miss schedu led applications for more than 3 consecutive days. 
The percentage of compliant subjects will be also presented.  
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The efficacy analyses will be conducted on the mITT and PP populations.  
 
Primary Endpoints  
For each of the co -primary endpoi nts (percent change from Baseline at Week 
12 in the inflammatory lesion counts and in the non -inflammatory lesion 
counts), the 90% confidence interval of the ratio of the mean percent 
reduction in lesion counts between the GDC 268 group and the Reference 
Product group will be assessed in the PP population. If the 90% confidence 
intervals are contained within the interval [0.8, 1.25] for both inflammatory 
and non -inflammatory lesions, bioequivalence between GDC 268 and the 
Reference Product will be demonstra ted. 
 
The percent change from Baseline at Week 12 in the inflammatory lesion 
counts and in the non -inflammatory lesion counts for each GDC 268 and 
Reference Product group will be compared against VEH group at an 
alpha=0.05 (p<0.05) in the mITT population u sing last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) imputation using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
factor of treatment in the statistical model using original percent change 
values.  
 
If the distribution of percent change from Baseline in the lesion counts ar e 
significantly skewed, the analyses will be performed based on rank 
transformed data.

scores will be presented at each visit by treatment group for the mITT and 
PP populations.  
 
Safety Analyses:  
All safety analyses will be performed in the Safety population unless 
otherwise stated.  
 
Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) coding dictionary. The number and percent of unique 
subjects reporting each treatment -emergent AE will be summarized by 
MedDRA system organ class (SOC), MedDRA preferred term (PT), and 
treatment group. AEs will also be similarly summarized by SOC, PT, 
maximum severity, and treatment gr oup as well as by SOC, PT, closest 
relationship to test article, and treatment group. All AEs reported during the 
study will be listed.  
 
Local Skin Reactions  
The frequency of the individual LSRs (erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, 
stinging/burning, pruritu s, erosion, and pain) will be tabulated by severity 
and treatment group at each onsite clinic visit. Subject counts for 
improved/same versus worsened compared to Baseline value will be also 
presented for the post -baseline visits.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  1. BACKGROUND 
Acne vulgaris (AV) is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis notable for open or closed 
comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and inflammatory lesions, including papules, 
pustules, or nodules (also known as cysts). Lesions are most common on the face, but the 
neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders may also be affected. Acne is a common skin 
disease, especially in adolescents and young adults. Approximately 50 million people in 
the United States have AV [ 1]. Acne affects approximately 89% of teenagers, but can occur 
in m
ost age groups [ 2]  and can persist into adulthood.  
 
Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease affecting the pilosebaceous follicles of the 
skin. The current understanding of acne pathogenesis is continuously evolving. Key 
pathogenic factors that play an important role in the development of acne are follicular 
hyperkeratinization, microbial colonization with Propionibacterium acnes , sebum 
production, and complex inflammatory mechanisms involving both innate and acquired 
immunity. In addition, studies have suggested that neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms, 
diet, and genetic and nongenetic factors all may contribute to the multifactorial process of 
acne pathogenesis [ 3]. 
 
Topical clindamycin is commonly used to treat acne. Clindamycin belongs to a class of 
medications called lincomycin antibiotics. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of 
bacteria that cause acne and by decreasing swelling. Clindamycin has a primarily 
bacteriostatic effect. It is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor that inhibits ribosomal 
translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the 50S rRNA of the 
large bacterial ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, 
pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others. Topical clindamycin is available 
in several formulations: a foam, a gel, a solution (liquid), a lotion, and a pledget (swab) to 
apply to the skin.  
 
C
lindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion, 1% (Cleocin T) was approved by the FDA in 1989 
for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. The reference product is currently available as 
an authorized generic product (GREENSTONE® BRAND). The FDA-approved regimen 
for the treatment of acne vulgaris is application of clindamycin phosphate topical lotion, 
1% twice daily to the affected area. A generic clindamycin phosphate topical lotion, 1% 
(GDC 268) has been developed by Gage Development Company, LLC for the topical 
tre
atment of acne vulgaris. 
2. RA TIONALE 
Gage Development Company, LLC has developed GDC 268, a generic clindamycin 
phosphate topical lotion, 1% formulation, and the current clinical study is designed to 
evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of this formulation with the currently marketed 
Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion, 1% (GREENSTONE® BRAND), the reference 
product. The dosage form, dosing frequency, treatment duration, and study design are

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  consistent with the Reference Product package insert and with the FDA Office of Generic 
Drugs recommendation for a bioequivalence study with a clinical endpoint in the treatment 
of acne vulgaris with topical clindamycin phosphate lotion, 1% [ 4]. 
3. OB JECTIVE 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and therapeutic equivalence 
of GDC 268 to Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion, 1% and to compare the efficacy of 
these two products to the GDC vehicle lotion (i.e., placebo) in the treatment of acne 
vulgaris. 
4. S TUDY DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 
comparison study of GDC 268 and Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion, 1% 
(GREEENSTONE® BRAND) in healthy male and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female 
subjects 12 to 40 years of age (inclusive) with facial acne vulgaris. Eligible subjects must 
have a clinical diagnosis of facial acne vulgaris with an Investigator’s Global Assessment 
(IGA) score of at least 2 (mild), a minimum of 25 but no more than 100 non-inflammatory 
lesions (open and closed comedones), a minimum of 20 but no more than 70 inflammatory 
lesions (papules and pustules) and ≤2 nodulocystic lesions (nodules and cysts) on the face 
a
t Baseline. Approximately 1200 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 50 study sites. 
Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups on a 2:2:1 basis as follows:  
 
1. GD C 268 (Gage) (generic clindamycin phosphate topical lotion) 
2. C lindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion, 1% (GREEENSTONE® BRAND) 
(Reference Product) 
3. GD C Vehicle (Gage) 
 
All subjects will be instructed to apply the assigned test article twice daily to the entire 
face, once in the morning and once in the evening, for 12 weeks. The study will consist of 
a Screening/Baseline Visit, a follow-up telephone call at Week 2, and follow-up visits at 
Weeks 4, 8, and 12/End of Study (EOS) or Early Termination (ET). An unscheduled in-
office follow-up visit may be completed at the discretion of the investigator for subjects 
with tolerability issues or a material adverse event (AE) concern. At EOS, safety and 
efficacy outcome measures will be compared to a) determine if treatment with GDC 268 i s 
clinically equivalent to the currently marketed Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion, 1% 
and b) both clindamycin phosphate 1% topical lotions are statistically superior in 
comparison to the GDC Vehicle.

Subjects from the same household will be allowed to participate in this study; however, no 
more than 2 subjects may be enrolled from the same household. Ideally, these subjects 
should not be enrolled in the study at the same time. If 2 subjects from the same household 
are enrolled concurrently, every effort shall be made to keep all test article and study 
documents (e.g., subject diaries) separate for each subject. Sites should carefully review 
each subject’s returned test article at each visit and question each subject as to whether they 
only used the test article assigned to them.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  applied using the fingertip by gently dabbing small amounts to the entire face (inclusive; 
i.e., forehead, nose, cheeks, chin, upper lip) and spreading the test article in a thin, uniform 
layer across the entire face, not just on individual lesions, with each application.  
 
Subjects will be instructed to apply the test article to the entire face twice daily, once in the 
morning and once in the evening, with approximately 8 to 12 hours in between applications 
for 12 weeks with the first dose of test article to be applied on the evening of the Baseline 
Visit. Note: Subjects who have an alternate sle ep-wake schedule may adjust their twice 
daily dosing according to their schedule as long as their twice daily applications are 
approximately 8 to 12 hours apart. Subjects should not wash the treated area for at least 4 
hours following test article application and should not apply the test article within 4 hours 
before any study visit. After test article application, allow a 10 minute dry-down period 
before applying any other approved facial product. 
 
Subjects will be provided with a Subject Instruction Sheet detailing how to apply the test 
article (see Appendix 1) and a Subject Diary (see Appe ndix 2) to record dates and times of 
applications and any missed doses. Subjects will be instructed to bring all test article bottles 
(used and unused) and the Subject Diary to each study visit. At each visit, the Subject Diary 
will be collected, reviewed, and a new one will be provided to the subject (as needed).  
6.3 War nings, Precautions, and Contraindications 
The safety information in this section is derived from the US Prescribing Information for 
Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion, 1% reference product (GREEENSTONE® 
BRAND). 
6.3.1 Contraindications 
Clindamycin phosphate topical lotion is contraindicated in subjects with a history of 
hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin, a history of 
regional enteritis or ulcerative colitis, or a history of antibiotic-associated colitis. 
6.3.2 Warnings 
Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis 
which may result in patient death. Use of the topical formulation of clindamycin results in 
absorption of the antibiotic from the skin surface. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis 
(including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and 
systemic clindamycin. 
 
Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-
associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and 
severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. 
Endoscopic examination may reveal pseudomembranous colitis. Stool culture for 
Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically.

Page 27 of 66 
 
CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL   
When significant diarrhea occurs, the test article should be discontinued. Large bowel 
endoscopy should be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis in cases of severe 
diarrhea. 
 
Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or 
worsen the condition. Vancomycin has been found to be effective in the treatment of 
antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C . difficile . The usual adult 
dosage is 500 milligrams to 2 grams of vancomycin orally per day in 3 to 4 divided doses 
administered for 7 to 10 days. Cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind vancomycin in 
vitro . If both a resin and vancomycin are to be administered concurrently, it may be 
advisable to separate the time of administration of each drug. 
 
Dia
rrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis have been observed to begin up to several 
weeks following cessation of oral and parenteral therapy with clindamycin. 
6.3.3 Precautions 
General 
Clindamycin phosphate topical products should be prescribed with caution in atopic 
individuals. 
 
Drug Interactions 
Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance 
the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore it should be used with caution 
in patients receiving such agents. 
 
Pregnancy 
Teratogenic effects 
In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during 
the second and third trimesters has not been associated with an increased frequency of 
congenital abnormalities. There are no adequate studies in pregnant women during the first 
trimester of pregnancy. Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy 
only if clearly needed. 
 
Nursing Mothers 
It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of 
clindamycin phosphate. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has 
been reported to appear in breast milk. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse 
effects on the breastfed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is 
required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate 
drug may be preferred. Monitor the infant for possible adverse effects on the 
gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in 
the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL   
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with 
the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed 
child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
6.3.4 Adverse Events with Use of Topical Clindamycin 
Per the Reference Product package insert, in 18 clinical studies of various formulations of 
clindamycin phosphate using placebo vehicle and/or active comparator drugs as controls, 
patients experienced a number of treatment emergent adverse dermatologic events 
including burning, itching, dryness, erythema, oiliness/oily skin, and peeling. Abdominal 
pain, gastrointestinal disturbances, gram-negative folliculitis, eye pain, and contact 
dermatitis have also been reported in association with the use of topical formulations of 
clindamycin. 
7. RANDOMIZATION ASSIGNMENT 
Subjects will be randomized on a 2:2:1 basis to one of three treatment groups: 
1. GD C 268 (Test) 
2. C lindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion, 1% (Reference Product) 
3. GD C Vehicle (Placebo) 
 
The study will use a central randomization scheme and stratified by the number of non-
inflammatory lesions (≤70 / > 70) present at the Baseline visit. Subjects who are eligible 
for enrollment into the study will be randomized at Visit 1/Baseline; subject kits will be 
dispense
d according to the kit number assigned by an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS) as subjects are enrolled. Treatment group designation will remain blinded until the 
final database is locked (see Section 15).  
 
A 
sealed copy of the randomization scheme should be retained at the study site and should 
be available to FDA investigators at the time of site inspection to allow for verification of 
the treatment identity of each subject. 
8. P RIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPIES 
Current medications and any medications taken within 30 days prior to the start of the study 
(Baseline) will be recorded as prior/concomitant medications with the dose (in source 
documents only) and corresponding indication. The medications to be recorded include 
prescription, OTC medications, and vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements being 
taken for a therapeutic indication. Vitamins and mineral supplements are permitted at 
dosages considered by the investigator as reasonable for maintaining good health and will not 
be recorded on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs). All concomitant medications will 
be coded with the current version of the WHO Drug Dictionary.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  During the study, the following are prohibited: 
 An y other topical or systemic therapy, which may materially affect the subject’s 
acne, in the investigator’s opinion; 
 Exposure to excessive sunlight or artificial tanning devices. 
8.2 Allow ed Medications or Therapies 
Contraception for WOCBP is required per Inclusion Criterion #8 (see Section 5.1.1). 
Vitamins
 and mineral supplements are permitted at dosages considered by the investigator 
as reasonable for maintaining good health and will not be recorded in the eCRFs. 
 
Subjects must be on a consistent skin care regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to 
Visit 1/Baseline and must not alter the regimen for the entire study. NOTE: Subjects who 
c
hange from using a medicated acne cleanser that contains benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, 
etc. to using a bland non-medicated/non-acne cleanser prior to Visit 1/Baseline will only 
be
 required to have used the new non-acne cleanser for at least 2 weeks in order to establish 
a stable skin care regimen. Allowed skin care products include any type or brand of make-
up, cleanser, non-medicated facial product, or hair product (e.g., Clinique foundation, 
Cetaphil soap, shampoo, hair gel, hairspray, mousse). General skin/hair care products (e.g., 
shampoo, hairspray, Cetaphil soap) and minimal use of non-medicated facial products and 
make-up (e.g., light powder, light foundation, lip stick, mascara, sunscreen) is permitted 
after test article application and a 10-minute dry-down period, provided that the subject has 
been using the products for at least 4 weeks prior to Vis it 1/Baseline. Changes in the use 
of 
type or brand of eyeliner for use on the eyes, lipstick, and/or mascara for the eyelashes 
are allowed prior to and during the study since these products do not involve facial areas 
typically affected by acne and thus, do not materially impact the Treatment Area. These 
and other allowed skin care products do not need to be recorded in the eCRFs. With respect 
to sunscreen, if sunscreen is not part of the subject’s stable skin care regimen, sunscreen 
may be used in the Treatment Area for significant sun exposure events (e.g., out on a boat 
all day); however, such use of sunscreen should be listed as a concomitant medication or 
therapy and recorded in the eCRFs. 
 
Therapies (medication and non-medication therapies) not restricted by the protocol may be 
used during the study for the treatment or prevention of disease or to maintain good health.  
 
Non-prohibited chronic therapies being used at Visit 1/Baseline may be continued, but must 
be recorded. 
 
Intranasal steroids as well as inhaled (puffer) or ophthalmic steroid preparations are allowed. 
 
Reasonable use of OTC medications such as NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen) or 
analgesics or antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) for relief of headache, muscle ache, etc. is 
allowed during the study and must be recorded.

10.3 S afety Evaluations 
10.3.1  Adverse Events 
All reported or observed AEs will be recorded. At each visit, subjects will also be 
questioned specifically about the status of any ongoing AEs. Untoward events that occur 
prior to the first dose of test article will be captured in the Medical History section of the 
eCRF unless they are related to a study-specific procedure. See Section 14  for details on 
Adverse Event Reporting.  
10.3.2  Local Skin Reactions 
At each visit, LSRs (erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, pruritus, erosion, 
and pain) will be assessed. Erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, and erosion will be assessed 
by the investigator and stinging/burning, pain, and pruritus will be assessed by the subject. 
Assessments will be made using a 4-point ordinal scale where 0=absent, 1=mild (slight, 
barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense). Only 
LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication), require withholding 
or discontinuation of the application of the test article, or extend 2 cm beyond the 
Tr
eatment Area will be documented as AEs. Any LSR that are not listed above will be 
recorded as an AE. 
10.3.3  Vital Signs

11. P HOTOGRAPHY 
Photography documentation is required in this study so to participate in the study subjects 
must consent to photographs. Photographs taken as part of this study will be used to 
document the subject’s baseline disease, AEs, or other findings during the study. The site 
will be provided with suggested guidelines to assist them in taking standardized 
photographs of the face in 3 views (front, right, and left [45 degrees oblique for right and 
left]) at Baseline. All photographs taken as part of this study are for informational purposes 
only and are not to assist in grading or for any other assessment. Photographs will be 
compiled and reviewed and may be used to evaluate investigator/grader training needs, but 
no formal assessments will be performed.  
 
Note: Subjects who decline to have photographs taken during the conduct of study after 
Baseline may continue to participate in the study. If a subject initially consents to 
photographs, then declines further photography as/if required, the Sponsor may use the 
photographs taken under consent for the purposes noted above. 
 
Additional details regarding photographic methods, uploading and labeling photos etc. will 
be provided in a Photo Manual to the site. 
12. L ABORATORY TESTS 
12.1 Ur ine Pregnancy Tests 
The UPTs will be performed at the study site, if the site is registered and conforms to CLIA 
regulations for such testing (possesses a current valid CLIA Certificate of Waiver), or at 
an appropriately registered reference laboratory. The investigator will report the UPT 
results on the eCRFs, in the subject’s medical records, and in independent records 
maintained at the study site. The UPT used must have a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU of 
-
hCG/mL. 
13. E ND OF STUDY CRITERIA 
At the end of each subject’s participation in the study, the investigator will complete an 
EOS Disposition form for all completed and discontinued subjects.  
13.1 Co mpletion of the Study 
Subjects who complete the 12-week course of treatment as specified in this protocol will 
be considered to have completed the study.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  13.2 Subject Discontinuation 
A subject may be withdrawn from the study prior to completion for any of the following 
reasons: 
 AE s 
 De ath 
 L ack of efficacy 
 L ost to follow-up 
 Non -compliance with test article 
 P hysician decision 
 P regnancy 
 P rogressive disease 
 P rotocol deviation 
 S tudy terminated by Sponsor 
 W ithdrawal by subject; NOTE: if the subject decides to withdraw from the study 
due to an AE then it should be classified as withdrawal due to an AE 
 Other (e.g., any reason that may affect the outcome of the study or safety of 
subjects) 
 
If a randomized subject withdraws from the study prematurely for any reason, the site 
should make every effort to have the subject return to the clinic to perform all of the 
required visit activities and to collect and reconcile all test articles (if applicable). If the 
randomized subject will not return to the clinic, the site should make every attempt to 
contact the subject; otherwise the subject will be considered lost to follow-up.  
 
When a subject is withdrawn from the study for a test article related AE (as defined in 
Section 14.2), when possible, the subject should be followed until resolution or 
stabili
zation of the AE. If the subject is discontinued from the study due to pregnancy, the 
pregnancy and its outcome should be followed. 
 
Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn or discontinued from the study will not be 
replaced. 
13.3 S tudy Termination 
The study may be terminated by the investigator or the Sponsor. If, in the opinion of the 
investigator, clinical observations made during the study suggest that it may be unwise to 
continue, he or she may stop the study. A study termination by the investigator will be 
reported to the Sponsor.  
 
In addition, a written statement fully documenting the reasons for this action will be 
submitted to the Sponsor by the investigator within 5 working days.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  In the event that the Sponsor chooses to discontinue or terminate the study, appropriate 
notification will be given to the investigator. 
 
If the study is terminated for any reason subjects should be withdrawn from the study in an 
orderly manner following the steps outlined in Section 13.2. 
14. AD VERSE EVENT REPORTING 
14.1 Adver se Event Definitions 
An ad
verse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, w
hether or not considered test article related.  
 
An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of 
the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
 
A suspected adverse reaction  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
 
An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. For the purposes of 
prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, 
reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its pharmacological 
action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Reference Product package insert or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by 
virtue of greater severity) if the IB Reference Product package insert referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Reference Product 
package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
Reference Product package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  14.2 Adverse Event Details 
AEs may be either spontaneously reported, observed, or elicited during questioning and 
examination of a subject. All AEs following the first dose of test article must be recorded 
on the AE eCRF. Any untoward events occurring prior to test article administration will be 
reported in the Medical History, unless related to a study-specific procedure. If known, the 
investigator should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its 
individual symptoms. Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation 
of test article or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in 
the study should receive follow-up as appropriate. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible) and, if they become serious, reported as serious adverse events 
(SAEs, see Section 14.3 ). If possible, the outcome of any AEs that caused permanent 
discontinuation or that were present at the end of the study, especially those considered by 
the investigator to be related to the test article, should be reported. 
 
Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s 
written informed consent/assent to participate in the study and a medical history should be 
taken at screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any changes in the health of 
subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unless an event occurred as a 
result of a study-related procedure and is unanticipated; in such cases, the event should be 
recorded as an AE and reported to the IRB as an “unanticipated problem” in accordance 
with local procedures. Other changes in subject health information becomes AE data when 
the subject begins dosing with the test article; therefore AE data should be collected from 
the date of the first dose of test article until the date of the final study visit. These data are 
considered treatment-emergent AEs. 
 
The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study. 
At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non-directive fashion, about any 
change in the subject’s overall health status since the previous visit. 
 
The severity of each AE, as judged by the investigator, will be recorded on the appropriate 
AE eCRF and will be graded according to the following scale: 
 
Mild - The AE is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living. 
 
Moderate - The AE is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant. 
 
Severe  - The AE interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL   
The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to 
the following categories: 
 
Related  – There is a strong medical evidence to suggest that the AE is related to 
test article usage. 
 
Possibly Related  – There is medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related 
to t
est article usage. 
 
Not Related  – There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related 
to t
est article usage. 
 
The investigator should categorize the outcome of the AE according to the following 
categories: 
 
Fatal - Termination of life as a result of an AE. 
 
Not Recovered/Not Resolved - AE has not improved or the subject has not 
recuperated.  
 
Recovered/Resolved - AE has improved or the subject has recuperated.  
 
Re
covered/Resolved with Sequelae - subject recuperated but retained the 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.  
 
Recovering/Resolving - AE is improving or the subject is recuperating.  
 
Unk
nown  - Not known, not observed, not recorded or subject refused. 
14.3 S erious Adverse Event 
An event that is serious must be recorded on the AE eCRF and on the TI SAE Report Form, 
and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. 
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opinion of either the 
investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath; the event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this serious 
criterion. 
 Life-threatening event; an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of the event and not an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had 
been more severe. 
 R equires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (for 
≥24 hours).

Sponsor Name: Gage Development Company, LLC Protocol Date: September 6, 2019, v3.0 
 
Page 41 of 66 
 
CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL   P ersistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 I mportant medical events; a medical event(s) that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
 Hospit alizations for the treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, of a pre-
existing condition that did not worsen; and 
 Tr eatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospital admission. 
 
AEs classified as “serious” by either the investigator or the Sponsor require expeditious 
handling and reporting to TI to comply with regulatory requirements. All SAEs, whether 
related or unrelated to test article, must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 24 hours from when the event occurred by telephone to the Medical Monitor 
and, in the event that he is unavailable, to the Project Manager (see contact 
information below).  Written notification of all SAEs should be sent to the Project 
Manager by email or confirmed facsimile transmission. These include those SAEs listed in 
the protocol or Reference Product package insert and must include an assessment of 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the test article caused the event.

In the event the Medical Monitor is unavailable, contact the Project Manager: 
 
 
 
 
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. Should the 
investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to test article) that 
occurs within 30 days after stopping the test article, the SAE must be reported in 

Product Name: GDC 268  Protocol: GDC-268-001

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy 
is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to TI, if available. 
 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Reference Product package insert and promptly submit a copy of this information to the 
responsible IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if 
the informed consent/assent require revision. The investigator should also comply with the 
IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of 
safety updates by the investigator to Health Authorities should be handled according to 
local regulations. 
 
The Sponsor or designee may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities 
(e.g., United States FDA) within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; 
therefore, it is important that investigators submit any information requested by the 
Sponsor or designee as soon as it becomes available. 
14.4 L aboratory Test Abnormalities 
There are no specific laboratory tests, other than UPT, required in this study.  
14.5 Pregnancy 
WOCBP (see Schedule of Events  for definition of WOCBP) must have a UPT prior to 
study enrollment. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance 
of avoiding pregnancy during the study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent/assent (if applicable) form 
documenting this discussion. 
 
WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect they 
might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) during the study and for 30 days 
after she has completed her last test article application. If a subject or investigator suspects 
that 
a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, the test article must be withheld 
until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, 
the subject must not receive or apply further test article and the subject must be 
discontinued from the study. 
 
If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a subject was 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator 
must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event and record the pregnancy on 
the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to TI. The investigator 
will also report any pregnancy associated with the study treatment as required by their IRB 
and keep careful source documentation of the event. 
 
Protocol-required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must 
be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x-ray studies).

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by the investigator and her managing physician or 
health care provider (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to TI, on 
the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow-up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although pregnancy 
itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs or SAEs 
(if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Offspring should be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks. 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the test 
article(s) should be recorded as an SAE with details documented in the pregnancy 
surveillance form. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be 
reported as an SAE. Elective abortions are generally not reported as an SAE unless an AE 
occurs that meets the criteria for an SAE. 
15. B LINDING/UNBLINDING 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Blinding is important for the 
integrity of this clinical study. Test article will be packaged in identical bottles so that 
neither the subject, investigator nor site staff will know the identity of the contents. 
However, the blind may be broken in the event of a medical emergency in a subject, in 
which knowledge of the test article identity is critical to the subject’s management. Before 
breaking the blind for a subject, the investigator should determine that the information is 
necessary (i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate management). In many cases, 
particularly when the emergency is clearly not test article related, the problem may be 
effectively managed by assuming that the subject is receiving active product without the 
need for unblinding. The need to break the blind should first be discussed with the 
responsible Medical Monitor if possible prior to breaking the blind and the best method to 
do this will be determined. 
 
A sealed copy of the randomization scheme should be retained at the study site and should 
be available to FDA investigators at the time of site inspection to allow for verification of 
the treatment identity of each subject.

17. S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
17.1 S ample Size 
Based on the assumption of a 40% reduction in inflammatory and non-inflammatory 
lesions counts for the Reference Product and a 38% reduction for GDC 268, 346 PP 
subjects per active arm will provide 85% probability of demonstrating therapeutic 
equivalence between the two active treatments at an alpha=0.05 (two one-sided tests) with 
90% confidence interval bounds of the ratio of means being 0.08 and 1.25. Assuming a 
25% reduction in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions counts for the VEH, 231 
mITT subjects in the VEH arm and 462 mITT subjects in each of the active treatment arms 
will provide at least an 85% probability of demonstrating that each active treatment is 
statistically superior to vehicle treatment at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Therefore, 
approximately 1200 subjects will be enrolled using a 2:2:1 randomization ratio (GDC 268: 
Reference Product: VEH) to obtain a total of 1155 mITT subjects and 865 PP subjects.  
17.2 E ndpoints 
17.2.1  Efficacy Endpoints 
Co-primary efficacy endpoints will include: 
 Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory (papules and 
pustules) lesion count. 
 Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non-inflammatory (open and 
closed comedones) lesion count. 
17.2.2  Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints will include: 
 I
ncidence (severity and causality) of any reported or observed treatment emergent 
AEs, whether or not they are considered to be related to the test article.

17.3 S tatistical Methods 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® Version 9.4 unless otherwise stated.  
 
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who applied at least one dose of 
test article.  
 
T
he mITT population will include all randomized subjects who applied at least one dose of 
test article.  
 
T
he PP population will include all mITT subjects who met all I/E criteria, were compliant 
with the assigned test articles based on the subject diaries (applied at least 75% and no more 
than 125% of the expected test article applications for the specified duration of the study), 
did not miss the scheduled test article applications for more than 3 consecutive days (i.e., 3 
consecutive days with no test article application), have no other evidence of material dosing 
noncompliance, and completed the primary endpoint evaluation at Week 12 within the 
designated visit window (Day 85 ± 4 days) with no protocol violations that would affect the 
treatment evaluation including use of the prohibited medications. 
 
Subject randomization will be stratified by the number of non-inflammatory lesions (≤70 / 
>70) present at the Baseline Visit in order to ensure balanced enrollment of subjects across 
the treatment groups by non-inflammatory lesion count. No subset analyses are planned 
based on baseline non-inflammatory lesion counts. 
17.3.1  Dosing Compliance 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize test article compliance for each analysis 
population. Compliant subjects are defined as those who apply at least 75% and no more 
than 125% of the expected test article applications, and did not miss scheduled applications 
for more than 3 consecutive days. The percentage of compliant subjects will be also 
presented.

the 90% confidence intervals are contained within the interval [0.8, 1.25] for both 
inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions, bioequivalence between GDC 268 and the 
Reference Product will be demonstrated. 
 
The percent change from Baseline at Week 12 in the inflammatory lesion counts and in the 
non-inflammatory lesion counts for each GDC 268 and Reference Product group will be 
c
ompared against VEH group at an alpha=0.05 (p<0.05) in the mITT population using last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
factor of treatment in the statistical model using original percent change values. 
 
If the distribution of percent change from Baseline in the lesion counts are significantly 
skewed, the analyses will be performed based on rank transformed data. 
17.3.2.2 Ex ploratory Efficacy Analysis 
The frequency distribution of the observed and change from Baseline IGA scores will be

Subjects who are discontinued early from the study due to lack of treatment effect after 4 
weeks of treatment will be included in the PP population analyses using LOCF. Subjects 
whose condition worsens and who require alternate or supplemental therapy for the 
treatment of their condition during the treatment phase of the study will be included in the 
mITT and PP population analyses using LOCF. Subjects discontinued early for other 
reasons will be excluded from the PP population, but included in the mITT population,

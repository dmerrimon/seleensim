RV-FOL -GELARC -0683C Amendment 5
Date : 08 Jan 2024 6OVERALL RATIONALE FO R PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 5.0:
The rationale for thisprotocol  amendment is to include an additional criterion,which is time 
driven ,tothe existing criterion,which is event sdriven ,to trigger the final progressi onfree survival 
(PFS;co-primary endpo int) analysis and therefore the endof the study .
Based on preliminary assumpt ions in t he init ial versio n of the protocol, a median PFS of 83months 
(6.9 years) was expected with standard treatm ent (rituximab plus chem otherapy ),and the object ive 
was to increase themedian PFS by 30% with the experimental treatm ent (rituximab plus 
lenolidomide ), ie, an expected median PFS of 108 mo nths (9 years). To detect this difference wit h 
a power of 80% and a bilateral alpha risk of 5%, 456 PFS events (assessed by an Independent 
Review Committee [IRC] ) were required .
A decrease in the number of PFS events (progression/relapse) , asassessed by the IRC, over the 
past 4years has been noted, decre asing from 46 events in 2019 to 7 events in2022, and it is 
anticipated that over time there will be almost noprogression /relapse events to be detected .As 
follicular lympho ma is an indolent lympho ma and yearly computed tomography  (CT)scans are 
not recommended ,a significant number of pati ents who are f ollowed for an extended peri odwill
not have CT scans at the di screti on of  the invest igator. Of note, the recent PFS curve assessed by 
the IRC show eda trend to ward a plateau.
Taking into account published data for this study (Mor schhauser, 2022) and the uncertainty  of 
reach
ingthe expected 456 PFS events in 9 years , using a median foll ow-up period of  9.5 y ears to 
trigger the final PFS analysis (with anestimated study  end date of30Apr2024) is not anticipated
toimpact the overall results of the study .
Addit ional minor changes have 
been made related to administrative informat ion. This protocol
amendment represents cumulat ive changes to the original protocol.

Study Objectives The primary objec tive of the study is to compare the efficacy of rituximab plus 
lenalid omide torituximab plus chemotherapy followed by rituximab inpatients with
previously untreated follicular lymphoma. Efficacy determina tion will be based upon the 
co-primar yendpoints of complete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks and PFS 
assessed by theIRC using the IWG (Ch eson, 1999 )criteria.
The secondary objective s ofthe study are:
Tocompare the efficacy of rituximab plus lenalidomide versus rituximab plus 
chemotherapy followed by ri tuximab using other parameters of efficacy:
Complete Response (CR) at 120 weeks by IWG 1999 , 
Event Free 
Survival (EFS) by IWG 1999 , Time to Next An ti-Ly mphomaTreatment 
(TTNLT), and Overall Survival (OS)
Tocompare the safe ty of ri tuximab plus lenalid omide versus rituximab plus 
chemotherapy followed by ri tuximab.
Duration of the 
studyThedurat ion of theentire study willbeapproximately 12-13 y ears. Pati ents receive up to 
four weeks of screening, approximately 2.5 years oftreatment and upto10 years of
follow-up.
Number of patients Up to 250
Inclusion criteria Patients must satisfyallthe followin gcriteria to be enrolled in the stud y:

Design of the trial This multi-center, ope n-label study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of
rituximab plus lenalido mide versus rituximab plus chemotherapy followed by ri tuxima b .
The study i s divided into the Screening Period, Treatment Period, and F ollow-up Peri od.
Once a patient gives written consent, the patient may enter the Screening Period, which 
is permitted to last up to 4 weeks. During the Screening Period, the investigator will 
choose one standard-of-care regimen (“investigator’s choice”) for the patient from a list 
of permitted choices of rituximab -containing chemotherapy regimens. In addition, during 
the Screening Period, the subject will undergo safety and other assessments to determine 
eligibility for the study and undergo randomization to either experimental arm (rituximab 
plus lenalidomide) versus control arm (“investigator’s choice” of rituximab -
chemotherapy).  
Thepatientwill enter the Treatment Period once the patient has fu lfilled the required 
assessment in the Screening Period and has been randomized. Treatment must start as 
soon as possible after randomiza tion but no later than 2 weeks after randomiza tion. 
Treat mentPeriod for eachpatientstarts with firstintake of study drug,which is defined 
as Study Day 1 of Cycle 1. The patients willreceiveprotoco l-specified treatments until
(1)inabili tyto achieve a 25% reduction in the sum of the products of the diameters 
(SPD) by 12 weeks (first CT assessment), (2) inabili ty to achieve a response by 24weeks 
(second CT assessment), (3) relapse or progression ofdisease, (4)withdrawal ofconsent 
or (5) unacceptable toxici ty.
Allrandomize d patients will
be fo llowed for progr essionfreesurviva land overall 
survival using the same schedule. This includes all pa tients who discontinu ethe study
early foranyreaso n withou tdocu mented evidence of diseaseprogress ion.
Uponcompletion of the required treatments, the subject will enter the F ollow- Up Period. 
In the f oll
ow-up period,thepatientswill be followe d for di sease progression and overall 
surviva l.

Refer to the specific package inserts for preparation, administration, and storage 
guidelines. At the discretion of the investigator, the vincristine dose may be capped at 2 
mg. For patient ≥70 years old, the vincristine dose may be capped at 1.5 mg. For 
chemotherapy, dosages may be adjusted in case of large changes in body weight 
compared to baseline (≥ 10%) that lead to changes in BSA. For rituximab, no dosage 
adjustments should be performed.
Experimental arm : Patients randomized to receive rituximab -lenalidomide will receive 
six cycles of lenalidomide 20 mg daily on days 2 -22 ever y 28 day s. 
Patients exhibiting a CR/CRu after six cycles then receive 12 cycles of 10 mg 
lenalidomide daily on days 2-22 ever y 28 day s for a total of 18 cycles. 
Patients exhibiting a PR after six cycles receive an additional 3 or 6 cycles of the 20 mg 
lenalidomide dose until they achieve a CR/CRu at which time they receive the 10 mg 
lenalidomide dosing for 9 or 6 cycles respectively for a total of 18 cycles. Patients who 
remain in PR after the additional 6 cycles will receive 10 mg lenalidomide dosing for a 
total of 18 cycles.
All patients randomized to receive rituximab -lenalidomide receive rituximab, 375 mg/m2
on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle 1, day 1 of cycles 2 to 6; and 8 weeks later responding 
patients continue with 375 mg/m2rituximab every 8 weeks for 12 cycles . 
Lenalidomide treatment is continued for 18 cycles or until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal. 
The lenalidomide dose for each patient will be interrupted and modified following 
toxicity as described in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4. If a dose is reduced, re - escalation 
is not permitted.

reductio n in the sum of the products of the diameters (SPD) by 12 weeks (first CT 
assessment), or 2) a response of at least PR by 24 weeks (s econd CT assessment) will be 
withdrawn from the study treatment and followed for survival and PFS using the same 
schedule of assessments as patients continuing treatment as described in Table 1.
Screening and 
RandomizationOnce apatient gives written consent, the patientmay enter the Screening Period,which 
is permitted to last up to 4 weeks. During the Screening Period, theinves tigator will 
choose one standar d-of- care regimen (“inves tigator’s choice”)fo rthepatientfrom the
listofpermitted choices of rituxima b-containing chemotherapy regimens.
Inaddition, during the Screening Period, the patientwillunderg osafety and other 
assessments to determine eligibili ty for the study andundergo randomization to either 
experimental arm (rituximab plus lenalidomide) versus contro larm (Inves tigato rsChoice
of R-CH OP,R-CVP, orR-B).
Screening and rand omization will be performed via IVRS/IWRS.
Statistical Analysis Sampl esize:
Sample size calcula tionis based on providing adequate power to evaluate treatment 
effect on the co -primaryefficacy endp oints. 
Theco-primar yefficac yendp ointsarecomplete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks 
and PFS. To fulfill the primary objec tive of the study, it must be shown that the 
experimental arm is super ior to thecontro larmat=0.05 level based onCR/CRu rate at 
120 weeks which could be the basis for an early  approval or based on PFS to obtain full 
approval (Shih, 2003 ).
It is hypothesized that the complete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120week sis 60% in the 
control arm and 72% in the experimental arm. For 90% power to detect this difference 
with tw o-sided =0.05, atotalof 644patients(32 2 ineacharm)will berequired.
Considering the sample size requirements for both co -primary  endpoints, it is planned to 
enroll a total of approximately 1000 patients into the study. With this sample size, the 
power to detect the difference of 12% of complete response (CR/CRu) rate between arms 
will be 98%.
It ishypothesized that the median PFS is 83 months in the control a rm, and there is a 
30% increase in the median PFS in the experimental arm (corresponding hazard ratio of 
0.7692). For 80% power to detect this difference with tw o-sided = 0 .05, atotalof 456 
progression/relapse/death events will be required. It is planned to randomize a total of 
approximately 1000 patients in 1:1 ratio to the two treatmentarms (about 500 in each 
arm).
Analysis Plan:
Theco-primar yefficac yendp oints are the complete resp onse(CR/ CRu)rateat120 
weeks and the PFS. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITTpopula t
ion. 
Analy sis based on the mITT population is supportive.
The number and percent of patients with complete response (CR/CRu) at the 120 week
assessmen twill betabulated by treatmentarm. The ex perimental armwill bedeclare d
super iorifthetwo-sided p-valu efroma chi-squar etest is ≤ 0.05 in favor of the 
experimental arm. The primary analy sis will be performed using a stratified Cochra n-
Mante l

stratifica tionfactors: FLIPI score (0-1 vs 2 vs 3-5), Age (>60 vs <60),longes t diamete r
ofthe l argest node (>6 v < 6 cm).Theun-stratified test will be a supportive analysis.
The Kapla n-Meier estimates of PFS func tion will be provided. If a patient has a missing 
or incomplete CT scan, all other available CT scans or MRIs of the patientwill stillbe
used for the analy sis. The experimental arm will be declared su perior if the tw o-sided p-

The secondary efficacy endpoints are CR rate at 120 weeks , EFS, TTNLT, and OS. In 
order to contro lan overall tw o-sided 0.05 stud y-wise Type I error rate, a fixed -sequence 
gate-keeping procedure willbeempl oyed to interpret the analysis results of these 
secondary effica cyendpoints in the order of CR rate at 120 weeks, EFS, TTNLT, and 
OS.
Time of analysis :
Interim analysis for futility
For the co -primaryendp oint ofthe complete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks, two 
interim analyses for futili tyare pre-planned:
The first interim analysis will be performed when the first 200 patients have 
their response assessments done at 6 months of treatment, or have had disease 
progression or died prior to this timep oint. 
The se cond interim analysis will be perfor med when the first 200 patients have 
their response assessments done at 120 weeks, or have had disease progression 
or died prio r to this timep oint.
Theinten tion of these two interim fut ility analy ses is to assess ris k-benefit and ensure 
patient safe t
y. The proposed fu tilityboundar ies are no n-binding.  The resu lts of these
twofutility analy ses will be reviewed by theindependent DMC to m ake recommendation 
ofgo/no go.  There is no plan to claim efficacy super iority b ased on the se interim results, 
therefore, no T ype I error rateadjus t mentisneeded.
Interim analysis for efficacy
The co -primar yendpointPFS will be analyzed as an interim analysis at the 
timepoint when the co -
primary  endpoint CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks is reported, i.e., 
when all randomized patients have their response assessments done at 120 weeks, or 
have had disease progression or died p rior to the 120 week assessment. 
In order to control the overall alpha for PFS, an alpha spending function of Gamma 
Family with parameter -2.5 will be applied. It is estimated that around 228 PFS events 
(ie, 0.50 information) would occur at the first inte rim PFS analysis, and 342 PFS events 
(ie, 0.75 information) are required at the second interim PFS analysis. The final PFS 
analy sis will be performed based on a total of 456 PFS events or,at the latest ,when 
9.5years of median follow -up ha sbeen reached, whichever occurs first . A statistically 
significant treatment effect on PFS will be reached if the two -sided p-value is  ≤ 0.011 at 
the first interim PFS analysis, or ≤ 0.019 at the second interim PFS analysis, or ≤ 0.039 at 
the final PFS analysis . 
Final analysis
The final analysis will be performed:
for the co -primary  endpoint CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks: when all randomized 
patients have their response assessments done at 120 weeks, or have had disease 
progression or died prior to the 120 -week assessment ,
for the co -primary  endpoint PFS: when the required 
456progr ession/relapse/death events have occurred among all randomized 
patients or,at the latest ,when 9.5 years of median follow -up ha sbeen reached, 
whichever occurs first .
The alpha level for the final analysis may be adjusted based on the total number of PFS 
events if the study is terminated prior to accumulating the originally planned 456 events. 
The secondary endpoint CR rate at 120 weeks will be analysed when all randomized

4.1 Follicular lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymph oma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoprolifera tive malignancies 
with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatm ent (Armita ge, 1993). Most of the NHLs 
are of 
B-cellorigin. The prognosis depends on the histol ogic type, stage ,age, and treatm ent. 
Follicular lymph oma (FL) is the most frequent low grade NHL accounting for approximately 20%
ofallNHL. FListypicall y indolent with a median overall survival of 7-10 years. Although FL 
responds well to trea tment it is characteri
zed by recurrent progressions with shorter intervals in 
between (Salles , 2007) . Transfor m ation to diffuse large B-celllympho mais relatively common in
patients with FL occurring at a rate of approximately  2-3% per yearforat least 15 years ( Bast ion,
1997 ).Eventually m ost FL patients dieoflymph oma regardless of the treatmentinitiated.
Both clinical and biolo gical(immune signature) prognosti c factors have been reported (Solal -
Celigny , 2004; Federico , 2009 ;Dave , 200 4).  The high incidence (~90%) of BC L-2deregulat ion 
involving a t(14;18) transl ocation in FL forms the basis for PCR assessment ofminimal residual 
disease (MRD) in FL (Rambaldi , 2002). The substan t ialspontaneous remissio n rate (Horning ,
1984 ),prognost ic value of the l ocal immune response (Dave, 200 4) and immune suppressi on 
(Ramsay, 2009 )com mon in FL all pointto the importance of the host immune response in this 
disease.
4.2 Standard ofCare Therapy inPreviously Untreated Follicular
Lymphoma
Localized stages (Stage I and II) of FL are typicall ytreate d with l oco-regiona lradiotherapy . Watch 
and wait is a strategy that has been empl oyed bysome clinicians for asymptom atic, low tumor 
burden FL and in some cases even for advanced stage disease FL patient s. There is, however, 
consensus that previously untreated FL patients with advanced stage symptoma tic or bulky diseas e
(Stag e IIbulky disease, Stage III and IV) are in need of systemic therapy (Salles , 2007).
H
istorically FL lymph oma ha s been treated wi th single agent or combinat ion chemotherapy ( Van 
Hend e, 2007 ).The addi tion of ri tuximab, a monocl onal antibody with specific ity for the B-cell 
CD2 0antigen, to combination chem otherapy  has consisten tlydemonstratedincreased overall 
response rates, response durations and in some studi es an overall survival benefit (Salles , 2007) 
establishing rituxima b
-chemotherapy regimens as standard therapy forpreviously untreated FL 
patients in need oftreatment. The National LymphoCare study which studiedtreatments 
administered to 2,728 newly diagnosed FL patient s in the US during 2004-2007 reported 
r
ituxima b-CHOP andrituxima b-CVP as the most oftenused rituxima b-chemotherapy regimens 
(Friedberg, 2009). R- CVP is also approved as first line therapy for FL in the US.
I
n late 2009 ,theStiL group reported results from a Phase 3 study tocompare the efficacy  and 
safety of ri tuxima b-bendamus tine (R- B)versus R-CHOP as first l inetherap y for patients with FL,
indolent and mantlecelllymph omas (Rummel ,2009 ). Five hundred forty nine pa tients in nee d of
treatment were randomized to treatment with 2 doses of bendamus tine(90mg/m2) and1dose of
rituxim ab (375 mg/m2) every 28 days, or to the standard R-CHOP regimen every 21 days, for a
maximum of 6 cy cles. Pati entcharacteris tics were well balanced and a median number of6 cycles

Date : 08 Jan 2024 37was given in both treatment arms. At the time of analysis the median observation timewas 32
months. Overall response rate for patients treated wit
h R-B was similar to the CHO P-R group 
(93,8% vs 93,5%, respectively). The CR rate was significan tly higher with40.1% for R-B 
compared to 30.8% for R-CHOP (p=0.0323). Medi anPFS was significan tly longer after R-B 
compared to R-CHOP: 54.8 versus 34.8 months (p=0.0002), hazard ratio (HR) 0.5765 (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.4292 to 0.7683) for all patients and was not reached afterR-B versus 
47 months after R-CHOP for the FL patients. Further, R-B was better tolerated than R-CHO P
demonstrating significan tlyless toxicity.Based upon these findings the authors conc luded that the 
combina tion of bendamust ine plus rituximab improves PFS and CR rates while showing a better 
tolerabili typrofi lecompared to R- CHOP and that R-B has the potential to becomeanew standard
first-line treatment option for patients with FL, MCL, and ind olent lymph omas in so mecountri es.
Theapproval of rituximab by both the EMA and FDA for use as a maintenance agent in previously 
untreated FL patients responding to rituxima b-chemotherapy  further anticipates the apparent 
evolution of the rituxima b-bendamus tine combina tion.
In 2010 the GELA (Salles , 2010) reported results from the PRIMA Phase II Istudythat invest igated
2 years of ri tuxima b(R) maintenance infollicular lymph oma (FL) patient s responding to firs t-line 
immunochemotherapy  consis tingofeither8cycles ofR-CVP , or 6 cy cles of R- CHO P or R- FCM
(plus 2 addit io nal rituximab infusio ns).1,217 patients were enrolled and75% received R-CHOP 
induction, 22% R- CVP and 3% R-FCM. 1,018 eligible patient s responding to induc tion therapy
were randomized (stratified byregimen and response to induc tion)toobserva tion orR-
maintenance , 375 mg/m 2 i. v. every 8 weeks for 2 years. The primar yendpo int of PFS was met at 
the planned interim analysis (ITT: 513 observa tion, 505 rituximab maintenance). Medi an follow-
up was 25 months from randomization (31monthsfrom studyentry).Ther ewas a si gnificant 
(stratified log-rank, P<.0001) improvement in the primary endp ointPFS,for R-ma intenance 
(hazard ratio [HR]=0.50; 95% CI [0.39-0.64]; 2-yearPFS 82%; 95% CI [78-86%] vs 66% [61-
70%
]forobservatio n). Time to next ant i-lymphoma treatment, as well  as response rate at the end 
of maintenance or observat ion, were significan tly improved in the R-ma intenance arm.Themost 
common AEs were infec tions (22% observatio n,37% R-ma intenance) .Grad e 3-4 AEs were
reported in16% (observa tion) and 22% (R-maintenance) of patients (neutropeni a 1% vs 4%; 
infec tions 1% vs 4%, respect ively). The authors concluded that the study demonstrate s 2 years of
R-ma intenanc etherap y afterinduct ion immunochemotherapy inpreviouslyuntreate d FL
significan tly improves PFS with lit tle add itionaltoxicity andprovides evidence for a new standard 
of care for FL patients in need of treatment. Based upon the resul ts of the PRIMA study (Salles ,
2011), both the European (October 2010) and United States (February 2011 )regulatoryagencie s
approve d rituximab as a first-linemaintenance treatm ent for patients with follicula rlymph oma 
whose disease has responded to initialinduc tiontherapy.
Taken together, the above resul ts indicate thatrituxima b-containing chem otherapy followedby 
rituximab maintenance therapy is a standard of care for patients with previously untreated follicula r
lymph oma in need of treatment. Median progression free survival (PFS) of 5-7 y earsor m ore can 
be expected with this treatm ent approach. Nevertheles s, unlike other lympho ma histo logies such 
as diffuse large cell lymphoma, cures are not expected.  In addition,theexisting treatments use

4.3 Lenalidomide
Lenalid omide (REVLIMID®Celgene Corp., NJ, USA) is a member of a class of pharmaceu tical 
compounds known as immun omodul atorydrugs (IMiD®);and has potent immun o-modul atory, 
anti-angiogenic and pro- apoptot icactivi ties invitro.
It offers potenti al benefi t over the first commer ciallya
vailabl eIMiD®compound, thalidomide, in 
termsofboth safet yandefficac y inhuman patient s (Galustian, 2004 ).The key to i ts therapeutic 
potent iallies inthefactthat ithas multi ple m echanisms ofaction,which acttoproduce both anti-
inflammatory and an ti-tumor effects. These effects are thought to be contextual in that theydepend 
on both the cell typeandthetriggering stimulus. To date, l enalido mide has been assoc iated with
TNF-αinhibitor y, T- cellcostimulatory,andantiangiogenic activities (Galustian, 2004).
Lenalid omid
e is marketed in the United States for the treatm ent of patients with transfusi on-
dependent anemia due to low- or intermediat e -1-ris k Myel odysplas ticSyndrome(MDS) 
associated with a deletion 5q cy togenet i cabnor mality with or with outadditional cy togenet ic 
abnor malities and in c ombina tion with dexamethasone for patients with previously treated multiple
myel oma. Lenalid omide is also approved and marketed in the US, EU, and Australia, in 
combination with dexamethasone, for the treatm ent of patients with multiple myeloma who had 
been treated with at least one prior therap y.
Lenalid omide is being inves tigated as treatm ent for various hematol ogical and onco logic 
indica tions. Studies have also been conducted in non-onco logic cond itions including complex

4.4 Preclinical Studies with Lenalidomide andRituximab inLymphoma
Lenalid omide i s an immun omodul atoryagent that has both direct tumoricidal and 
immun omodulatory activities which are cri tical for its clinical  activityin the treatm ent of  various 
hemato logic malignancies. This activityis at least in part mediated byenhanced T-cell and NK-
celleffector function to eliminate tumor B cells, attributed to restorati on of impaired T -cell activity
andformatio n of immuno logic synapses. There are also direct effects on tumor cells, including 
up-regul atio n of tumor suppressor ge nes, leading to cell cycle arrest.
Preclinical studi es have shown an enhancement of ADCC (Wu, 2008) andant i- tumor effects in 
vivo (Hernande z-Ilizaliturri, 2005; Zhang, 2009) whenlenalid omid ewascombined wi th 
rituximab. In a murine NHL model, lenalido mide induced significant increase in the recrui tment 
ofNK cells to tum or sites resul tingin enhanced ant i-tumoractivity of Rituximab (Redd y, 2008 ). 
Whe n combined withrituximab, lenalid omide improved survival in a mouse NHL model and the 
anti-tumoractivitywasshow n to be NK- mediated. ( Hernandez -Ilizaliturri, 2005 ).

Date : 08 Jan 2024 39Recent preclinical studi es suggest that lenalid omide maypromoterestoration of anti-tumor 
immun ological  effects in patients with certain hematol ogical malignancies. Ramsay, 2008 reported 
that impaired T cell immun ological synapse formation was seen in both CD4 and CD8 Tcells
from fol licular lymph oma (FL) patients compared to age-matchedhealthy donors. It wasfurthe r
demonstrated that the immune synapse defects were repaired in part by treatment of  the cellswith
lenalido mide. Treatment of both FL B cells and autol ogous T cells with le nalid omide (1μM for 
24h) was requi red to enhance formation of the F-actin synapse. Lenalid omide treatment induced 
actin cytoskeleton reorganiza tion andpolariza tion of MCL cells as early as30 min, a process 
termed “capping,” which is considered an important subcellular componen t ofthe immune synapse
formation ( Gaidarova, 2009).  Addi t io nally ithasbeen shown thatthe combined use of 
lenalid omide and rituximab enhances NK cell-mediated immune synapse formatio n and the 
resultant cytotoxic ity, versus each agent alone.It was recent ly demonstrated that lenalido mide 
induces CD2 0-localizatio nwithin the “cap,” and that the addition of ri tuximab can enhance 
immune synapse formation (Gaidarova , 2009) .   Thecapping ofCD20 is accompanied by 
redistribu t
ion of proteins such as Vav1 and Rac1 that become part of the immune synapse complex. 
Therefore the capping process induced by lenalid omide appears integral to immun esynaps e
formation and may coordinate lyenhanc ethe clustering of both the CD2 0antigen and the attached 
rituximab, potentially further enhancing its ac tivity,whic hwould support the clinical c ombina tion 
of these agents.
Gandhi, et al (2009) reported that in FL celllines andprimary cells the lenalido mide-rituximab 
combination produced synergistic anti-proliferative effects, cytotox icity m ediated via non-
immune mechanisms, up regulated expressi on of the p21 gene, maintenance of elevated Egr1 
expressi on and that le nalidomide can potentiate rituxima b-induced cell death through a mechanis m
involving Bcl-2 phosphoryla tion. The authors concluded that these data were consistent with the 
clinical findings demo nstrating the clinical benefit of c ombinin glenalid omide with rituximab.
These laboratory observa tions of di rect lenalid omide and rituximab effects on tumor cells, in 
inducing theexpressi on of potenti al tumor suppressor genes andproteins potentially involvedin 
tumor cell recogni tionby T cells, as well as cellular lenalid omide effects on the host immune cells 
potenti ally to improve tumor cell recogni tion, serve as the scien tificbasis for the use of rituxima b-
lenalid omide combinat ion described in the clinical trial protocol.
4.5 Clinical Studies ofLenalidomide orRitux imab-Lenalidomide in FL
Single agent lenalid omide was studi edinpatients with relapsed/refractory indolent NHL, 
including FL (Witzig, 2009). The dose/regimen used in this study was25 mg qd x 21 days q 28 
days for maximum of 52 weeks. Forty-three (43) patients enrolled. Patients received a median of 
three prior sy stemic therapies (range, 1 to 17) and half were refractory to lasttherapy. ORR was
23% (10 of  43), including a 7% complete response (CR) or unconfirmed CR rate. Twent y-seven 
percent (six of 22) of pat ients with f ollicula rlymph oma grade 1 or 2 responded to therapy . Median 
durati on of response (DR) was not reached, but was longer than 16.5 months with seven of10 
responses ongo ing at 15 to 28 months for the entire group including FL. Median PFS for thewhole 
group was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 10.4 months). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse

respectively ).
Three recent clinical studi es have reported that the combina tion of ri tuxima b-lenalido mide yields 
high response rates and high c omplete response rates in patients with FL.
In 2011, Fowler et al reported the resul ts of an ongoing Phase 2 study evalua tingtheefficacy and 
safety of ri tuxima b-lenalid omide in patients with untreated, stage III/IV, indolent NHL. Patients 
with m easurable (>1.5 cm) disease untreated indolent NHL received 20 mg/day of lenalid omide 
on day s 1-21and ri tuxima b 375 mg/m2on day 1 of each 28daycyclefor up to 6 cy cles. Response 
was assessed after every 3 cycles using the IWG (Cheson, 1999 )criteria. At the time ofthis report ,
75patientshadcompleted 6 cycles oftreatmentorwere off-study. The median age was 57(35-84) 
years, 55% of pts were male, and 70 pts were evaluable for response. Among all patients, the 
overall response rate was 90%. Complete responses (CR) we re attained in 66% of patients, 17 pts 
(25%) had a partial response, and stable disease was seen in 6 (9%). Among the subset ofpatients
with fol licula rlymph oma, 34/39 (87%) evaluable patients attained a CR. Following cy cle 6 ,nearl y
all FL patients dem onstrated mol ecular response wit hout detectable BCL- 2 by PCR.  At a median 
f
ollow up of 14.4 (7- 32.5) m onths, 4 patients experienced progressi on of disease. Grade 3/4 
adverse events were rash (7 pts), neutropenia (20 pts), muscle pain (7 pts), thromboc ytopen ia (4
patients)infect ion (3 pts), and thrombosis (3 pts).  Five patientswereremoved fromtreatment due 
to adverse events but were eligible for toxici tyassessment, including 1 with grade 3 rash, 1 arteria l 
thrombosis , 2infusi on reactions and 1 trans ientepisode ofrespirator y failure, all ofwhich occurred 
during the first 2 c ycles. The authors concluded that the bi ologic combina tion of lenalido mide and 
rituximab used as front line therapyproduces excellent overall and complete response rates with 
mana geabl etoxi city i n patients with indolent B cell NHL.
Dutia et a
l(2009)reported the results of a  clinical trial of the combina tion of ri tuximab and 
lenalid omide in 16 patients with relapsed/refractory  indolent l ympho ma.  Patients received 
lenalid omide 20 mg daily for three weeks in 4-week cy cles and also rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly 
x 4 doses starting on day 15.Lenalidom idewascontinued to diseaseprogress ion. The median age 
was 60 years old, m edian lines of prior therapy was 3, and 7 patients were refractory to rituximab. 
Of the 16 patients, 13 had FL. In this subset of FL patients, the response rate was 85%. A CR/CRu 
was achieved in 5 patients (38%).
Ahmadi et al (2009) are conducting a phase II trial of lenalid omide-dexamethason e-rituximab in 
patients with i ndolent B- cell or m antle cell lymphom as refractory  to ri tuximab, defined as failure 
to respond to or progression within 6 months, of rituximab monotherap y,prior ri tuximab 
containing chemothera py, or ri tuximab maintenance. Patients receive two 28 -day treatment cycles 
of lenalido mide 10 mg daily anddexamethason e 8 m g once weekly  (Part 1). Af terassessment of 
response, all patient s receive rituximab 375 mg/m2weekly for 4 doses during cycle 3(Part2).
Lenalid omide-dexamethasone therapy continues during and after rituximab. Of the first 9patients
with FL comp leting both parts of the treatm ent regimen, the response rate was56% and the CR 
rate was 44%.

Lenalid omide pharmacokinetics (PK) hasbeen studi edinhealthy volunteers, patients with renal 
impairment, andpatients withmul
tiplemyel oma (MM) or myelodysplas ticsyndr omes(MDS) 
(Revlimid package insert , 2009 ). Please see the Investigator Brochure for further details.
Renal function is the most important i ntrinsic factor affec tingpharmacokinetic s of lenalido mide. 
With diminishing renal function, totaland renal clearance of lenalid omide decreased while total 
drug exposure AUC and the t1/2increased. Dose adjustment s are recommended for patients with 
CLcr<60 mL/min.
Inpatients with MM (baseline serum crea tininelevel ≤ 1.5 m g/dL) , Cmaxoccurred between 0.5 to
6 hours pos t-dose. Plasma exposure (AUC and Cmax)increases proportionally with dose following
single andmultiple doses (up to 50 mg/da y). In patients with MDS (baseline serum creati ninelevel
≤ upper limit of normal range), the drug was also absorbed rapidly (median tmax=1 h), with 
approximately  65% of the administered dose excre ted unchanged in urine over 24 hours postdose. 
Lenalid omidehalf-life in plasma ranged from 3 to 5 hours i n these MM or MDS patients. As a 
resul t, the drug did not accumulate in plasma upon multiple daily doses. However, exposure 
(AUC) in these patient s was approximately 50-60% higher compared to healthy v olunt eers.This 
is consistent with their compromisedrenalfunction, possibly as a consequence oftheir age and 
their disease.
Thepharmacokine ticsoflenalid omide has not been studied in pa tients with lym phoma, including
f
ollicula rlymph oma, except that PK data is available in adult T -cell leukemia/lympho ma (ATLL ) 
patients .

6.1 Study Design Rationale
Follicula rlymph oma (FL) is a distincthistologi ctypewithin B- cellNHL further divided bythe 
WHO classifica tion (2007) into three different grades. Within grade 3, grade 3a is differen tiated 
histopathologically fr om3b. FL grade 3b is treated in a manner similar to DLBCL. Thus, FL grade 
3b is excluded fr omthisstudy.
Rituxima b has beco me the backbone of first line treatment for follicular lymph oma patient s who 
are in need of therap y. Recent studi es have established several  standard -of-care immun o-
chemotherapy regimens in previously untreated FL. In most phase 3 studi es in front line FL, it has 
not been possible to demonstrate OS benefit, and PFS has been used to assess efficacy . These
studies showed that the addition of rituximab to multi-agent chemotherapy regimens led to 
significan tly longer PFS and s ometimes longer OS. These regimens are R-CVP, R-CHOP and R-
bendamustine. Which of these regimens are considered standard of care varies depending on the 
geograph ic location and physician preference. Furtherm ore, rituxima b-maintenance studi eshave 
shown improved PFS, andEuropean and US regulatory agencies recen tlyapproved rituximab as
afirst-line maintenance treatm ent for patients with follicula rlymph oma whos ediseas ehas
responde d toinitialinduct iontherapy based upon theresul tsofthePRIMA study (Salles , 2011 ).
The current study is designed to i nvestigate theefficacy andsafety of l enalid omidetherapy in 
patients with previouslyuntreate dFL.The multi center nature ofthestudy prov ides assurance that 
the results are likely to have gener alapplicabil ity. The inclusi on of a control arm, and the fact that 
the Inves tigator must select the Invest igator’s choice option of a standar d-of- care for thepatient
before rando mizat ion, is intended to provide a realis tic co mpar ison to current standar d- of- care in 
this pat ient populat ion. Pat
ienteligibili tycriteria are consistent wi th those used in other studi es of 
this popul ation.
Patients are requi red to have measurable disease to facilitate the accurate assessment of CR/CRu, 
which is a direct measure of the co-primary efficac y endpoint CR/CRu rateat120week s. The 
International Working Group (IWG) response criteria were selected to provide an internationa l 
standard for the assessment of lymph oma ( Cheson, 1999). The use of this tool will ensure that data 
across centers are evaluated consisten tly and also allow for direct comparison to historical data.  
Safetywill be assessed by evaluat ingAEs andlaboratory data. AE and abnormal laboratory value
sever i
tywill be graded using versi on 4.03 of the National Cancer Ins titute Comm onTermin ology
Criteria forAEs (NCI CTCAE).
Know ntoxicitiesoflenalid omide,given alone orin combinatio nwith ri tuximab have been 
reported. In addi tion, in the clinical database and safe tydatabase of the sponsor, tumor flare, tumor 
lysis and venous thromboemb olus have been reported, as described further in Section 9.1.
Mon itoring fortumor flare and venous thromboemb olicevents (VTE –includin gpulm onary 
embolism and deep vein thrombosi s)will beperformedalong withsafety me asures that are 
routinely assessed in inves tigationalstudi es of hematologic malignancies. VTE prophylaxis is 
recommended for patients in the lenalid omide arm who are at high risk for a thromboemb olic 
event. VTE, TFR and TLS will be recorde d as AEs.

This multi- center, open-label study  is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of ri tuximab 
plus lenalido mide versus rituximab plus chemotherapy followed by ri tuxima b . Theoverall study 
desig n is described in Figure 2.The study is divided into the Screening Period, Treatment Period, 
and Follow-up Period.
Once a
patient gives written consent, thepatientmay enter the Screening Period, which is 
permitted to last up to 4 weeks. During the Screening Period, the inves tigatorwill choose one 
standard -of-care regimen (“invest igator’s ch oice”) for the patien tfrom alistofpermitted choices 
of rituxima b-containing chem otherapy regimens. In addition, during the Screening Period, the 
patientwill undergo safet y and other assessments to determine eligibili ty for thestudy and undergo
rando miza tion to eith er experimental arm (rituximab plus lenalid omide) versus control  arm
(“investigator’s ch oice”ofrituxima b-chemotherap y).
It is notedthatpatien teligibili tywill be based oninvest igator assessment. However, patien t’s 
diseasewill beassesse d by centra lpatho log yreview to confirm the FL di agnosis using formali n-
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor or lymph node tissue submitted in the Screening Phase or 
obtained fro
m the Scre ening biops y.
Thepatientwill enter the Treatm ent Peri od once the patienthas fulfilled the requi red assessment 
in the Screening Period and has been randomized .Treatment must start as soon as possible after 
randomization but no later than 2 weeks afterrandomiza tion. Treatment Period for each patient 
starts wi th first intake of  study drug,which is define d as Stud yDay 1 of Cycle 1.The treatm ents 
will be given as described in detail inSection 8.The patient s will receive protoco l-specified 
treatments, until:
1)Inabili ty to achi eve a 25% reducti on in the sum  of the products of the di ameters (SPD) by 12 
weeks (first CT assessment),
2)Inabili ty to achieve a response of at least PR by 24 weeks (second CT assessment),
3)Relapse or progression of disease,
4) With drawal ofconsent or
5)Unacceptable toxicit y.
Allrandomize d patients are followed for progression free survival and overall survival  using the 
same schedule described inTable 1,Schedule of Assessments. This includes pa tients who 
discontinuethestudyearly foranyreaso n with outdocu mented evidence of disease progression.
Uponcompletion of the requi red treatm ents, thepatientwillenter theFollo w-UpPeriod. In the 
follow-up peri od, the patients will be fo llowed for di seaseprogress ion, next lymph oma treatment 
(including next chemotherapy ) and overall survival.
All protocol  defined efficacy assessments will be conducted by Centra lReview including central 
radiologyand clinical review by an Indepe ndentRevie w Co mmittee (IRC). However, a pati ent’s 
withdrawa l fromthestudy for disease progressi on or failure to achieve threshol d clinical ac tivity 
at the 12 and 24 week assessments [see points (1) and (2) above ]will be based upon inves tigator 
assessment.

Date : 08 Jan 2024 46Since the study endpoint is PFS based on computed axial tomography (CT) as determined by IRC, 
progression will be based on CT scans.
For suspected progression based on clinical evaluatio n, a CT scan mu st be available demonstrating 
unequivocal progressi on.
For equivocal progressi on based on CT findings, the site Inves tigator willcontact theprincipal 
investigator of the study to determine whether the patient should r emain on the study treatment. In
some cases of equivocal progressi on, immediate central  reading of the CT scan in question may 
be requested prior to removing the pat ient from the study treatment. In such cases, if the PD isnot 
confirmed by central radi ologyreview, the pati ent shoul d cont inue treatment asper protoco l.
In limited instances where progression is evident only by assessments other than CT, CT scans 
muststill beobtained along with thenon-CT documentation of progression.
The same methodol ogywill beperformed for equivoca lcases ofthresho ldclinica lactivityat the
12 and 24 week assessments. That is, in equivocal  cases of th resholdclinica lactivi ty,the site 
investigator will contact the principal inves tigator of the study  to determine whether the patient 
shou ld remain on thestudy. In some cases immediate central  reading of the CT scan in question 
may be requested prior to rem oving the pati ent from the stud y. In such cases, if threshol d clinical 
activi tyis confi rmed by central  radiologicalreview ,thepatientshou ld continue treatm ent as per 
protoco l.

Thesecond futilit
yanalysis is to eval uate the compl ete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks for

Efficacy determinat ion will be based upon the co-pr imaryendp oints of complete response 
(CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks and PFS assessed by the IRC using the IWG (Cheson, 1999) criteria. 
The primary analysi s
ofcomplete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks will becondi tionalupon

8.1 Drugs description
Lenalid omide will be supplied as 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg capsules for oral 
administration and labeled as IP.
Commercially available IV formulat
ion of Rituximab background therapy and standard of care 
therapy,i.e.cyclophosphamide ,doxorub icin, vincris tineandbendamus tine will be used.
Commercially available prednis one will also be used as oral formulat
ion. Standard of care 
chemotherapy must be available by prescriptio n, generally reimbursed by the healthsyste mand 
used routinely inprevi ouslyuntreated FL patients at the center.
8.2 Treatment schedule anddesign
Treatment must start as soon as possible after rando miza tion but no later than 2 weeks after 
randomization. Treat ment Period for eachpatientstarts with first intake of study drug,which is 
defined as Study Day 1 of Cycle 1.
8.2.1 Experimental Arm : Rituximab -Lenalidomide
Patients randomized to receive rituxima b-lenalidomide will receive six cycles of lenalid omide 20 
mg daily  on days 2-22 every 28days. Pati ents exhibi ting a CR/CRu after six cycles then receive
12 cy cles o f 10 m g lenalido mide daily on days 2 - 22every 28daysfor a total of 18 cy cles. Pat ients
exhibi ting a PR after six cycles receive an addi tional 3 or 6 cy cles of the 20 mg lenalid o mide dose 
until they achieve a CR/CRu at which time they receive the 10 mg lenalid omide dosing for 9 or 6 
cycles respec tively for a total of 18 cycles. Patients who remain in PR aftertheadditional 6 cycles 
will receive 10 mg lenalido mide dosing for a tot al of 18 cy cles.
All pat ients randomized to receive rituxima b-lenalido mide receive rituximab, 375 mg/ m2on days
1, 8, 15 and 22 of  cycle 1,day 1 of cy cles 2 to 6; and8week s later responding patients continue 
with 375 mg/m2rituxima bevery 8week sfor 12 cycle s . Lenalid omide treatment iscontinued for
18 cy cles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxici t y, or voluntar y with drawa l.Inaddition,
patients who do not achiev e a 25% reducti o n in thesum of th e products of the diameters (SPD) by
12 weeks (first CT assessment), and patients who do not achieve a response of at least PR by 24 
weeks (second CT assessment) will be withdrawn fromtreatment and followed for survival and 
PFS using the same schedule of assessments as patients continuing treatm ent as described in
Table 1.
Lenalid omide dosing will be based on patients creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcrof t-
Gault formula. Crea tinine clearance shoul dbecalcul ated using actual  body weight.
Patients who have a creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min will receive oral lenalido mide that is 
initiated on Day [D] 2 of Cycle 1 at a dose of 20 mg [p.o.] once daily  for 21 day s (D2–D22)in 
each 28 day cycle.
Pat
ients who have moderate renal insufficiency [creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min but < 60 
mL/min] will receive a lower starting dose of lenalid omide of 10 mg once daily for 21 days (D2 –
D22) in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2.

may be increased to a maximum of 15 mg once daily for 21 days (D2 –D22) starti ng on da y 2of 
cycle3.
Lenalid omideshou ld be taken atapproximately thesametimeevery day . There is no requirement 
for taking lena
lidomidewith or wi thout f ood, or wi th or wi thout certain ty pes of  foods or li quids . 
If apatien tmisses adose oflenalid omide and it is within 12 hours of their normal dosing time,the
patien tshou ld be instructe d to m ake up the missed dose, and to then take their next dose according 
to their regul ar schedule . Lenalid omide concentrati on is low at 12 hours post dose, therefore 
making up a missed dose and then resuming regular dosing wi th a greater than or equal  to (≥)12
hour interval betwe en the two doses will not cause considerable drugaccumulation.

8.3 Dose Modifications
8.3.1 Lenalidomide Dose Modifications
The lenalid omide dose foreach patient will be interrupted and/or m odified by following the 
toxicity rulesasdescribed inTable 2,Table 3,and Table 4.
Basically, if a significant toxi city, defined as dos e
-limitingtoxicity in Table 2, occurs on or af ter 
da
y 15 of the cy cle,treatment will be held (interrupted) until the end o f the cycle and the dose will 
then be reduced by astep (dose level -1)inthesubsequent cycle.
Iftoxicity occurs befor eday 15 of the cy cle, treatment will be held until recovery  and restarted 
without dose reduction for the rest of the cycle(continue unt il day 21; missed doses will not be 
made up).
Thenext cyclewillresume atreduced dose (dose level -1)insubsequent cycles. In those instances
where intheopini on of the inves tigato rre-challenge at the same dose level poses an unacceptable 
risk to the pati ent, treatm ent will  be held (interrupted) until the end of  the cycle and thedose will
bereduced by  a step in the subsequent c ycle
In case of recurrence of an event during the same cycle, lenalid omide willbeheld untilthenext 
cycle.
Doses that were missed, due to toxi city or anyother reasons, will not be rescheduled. If a dose i s 
reduced, re-escala tion is not permitted.
There will be no dose adjus tment for ri tuximab. In case of cycle delay due to lenalido mide induce d
toxicity, ri tuximab ofthenext cycle will  also be postponed unt il AEhas reso lvedand recycling is 
allowed.
If dosing is interrupted for toxicit yor cy cle delayed , it can only be restarted if :

Therapies considered necessary for the patien t’s well being may be administered at the discreti on 
ofthe Inves tigator .Allmedica tions (prescri ption and non-prescr iption), growth factors, 
transfusi ons, treatm ents and therapies taken fro
m 28 days prior to start ofstudydrug through the 
lastdose ofstudy drug, must be recorded on the approp riate page of the CRF.
9.1.1 TFR Treatmen t-Lenalidomide Arm
Treatment of TFR is up to the discretion of the investigator depending upon the severi tyand 
clinical situation. It i s suggested that Grades 1 and 2 TFR be treated with no n-stero idal anti-
inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs ) [i.e. ibupr ofen 400-600 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed], 
corticostero ids, and/or narcotic analgesics for pain management. Refer toTable 2for f urther 
instruct ions and dose modifica tions fo r Grade 3 and 4 TFR.
Inmild to m oderat ecases , it is suggested that lenalid omide be continue dalongwithsymptom atic 
treatment as above . In more severe cases, lenalidomide should be interrupted, as indicated Table 2.
During the Treatment Phase, emergency use ofcorticostero ids at anydose totreatTFR symptoms 
for a pati ent in the l enalid omide arm is allowed at the Inves tigator’s discret ion.
9.1.2 Thrombo embolism Prophylaxi s-Lenalidomide Arm
It is reco mmended that patients in the lenalido mide arm who are at high risk for a thromboemb olic 
event (high riskincludes but not limited tobulkydisease ,histor y ofa thromboemb olic event and/or 
taking a concomita nt medication associ ated with an increased risk for a thromboemb olic event 
and/or a known hypercoagulable state regardless of thromboemb olic histor y) receive prophylactic 
aspirin (70– 325 m g) daily  unless contraindicated.  If aspirin is contraindicated, use of low
molecular weight heparin or warfarin (or equivalent VitaminK antagoni st) to keep the 
international norm alized ratio (INR) in the range of 2-3, or use of other ant i-thrombotic therap y
according tohospital guidelines, orphysician preference, is acceptable. However ,thechoice of
anticoagulant for prophylaxis for VTE relies upon the inves tigato r’s discret ionandshou ld be 
tailored to the patien t’s individua lrisk/benef itprofil eby taking into accoun t the individua l 
thrombotic risk (e.g., hi story of venous thrombosis), bleeding risk, and the quali ty of complianc e
with antithrombotic treatment.
9.1.3 Growth Factors
Growth factors (e.g. G -CSF,erythropo ietin, etc.) may be prescribed by the Inves tigator for rescue 
fromsever ehemato logic event sandshou ld be used in accordance with theAmerica nSocietyof 
Clinical Onc ology’s(ASCO ) guidelines or the European Soci ety for MedicalOnco logy(ESMO) 
guidelines.
Growth factors or platelet transfusi ons are not to be administered prophylac tically,excep tfor high

The intent of this study is to comparethe rituxima b plus l enalid omide regimen to standar d-of- care 
rituxima b
-chemotherapyregim ens in use in a particular countr y,geograph icregionor institution.
Therefore, during the Screening Phase, prior to randomiza tion, Invest igators will select one 
regimen from a choiceofprotocol specified choices of standar d-of- care chem otherapy regime ns 
fro
m the choicesdescribed inSection 8.2fortheirpatientduring screening and enter this choice 
intoIVRS /IWR S.
Standard of care chemotherapy regimen must be available byprescr iption, generally reimbursed 
bythehealth system and used routinely to treat previously untreated FL patients at the center.
After randomizat
ion,study drug is dispensed onDay 1 for l enalid omide patientsorInves tigator ’s 
Choice patients assigned to oral prednis one(R-CHO P or R- CVP) . For Cycle1only, a 2 weeks 
window between randomizat ion and Cycle1 Day 1 is allowed; however, the Screening period must
remai nwithin28days ofCycl e 1Day1 dosing.
10.3 Evaluation during treatmen tandfollow -up
Serial assessments of safe tyand efficacy will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Study 
Assessments ( Table 1). Pat i ents in both arms will  followcomparable assessment schedules. Note 
that for the first year of maintenanc e rituximab cycles are administered every 56 days and 
lenalid omide cycles every  28 days. To balance patient contacts during this time, patients inthe 
rituximab arm will call  the si te/or call center for a phone call interview every 28 days after each 
rituxima btreatment(for m onths with out rituximab administrati on) during the first year of 
maintenance. Laboratories used for hematol ogical  and biochemical tests and assays including 
ongoing pregnancy tests during thestudy are individua l centre l aboratori es.
10.3.1 Evaluation during each cycle of treatment
Physical examina tion (including weight, vital signs and ECOG PS) at day 1 ofevery treatment 
cycle

All response assessments will be determined fro m first dose date and will f ollow the counting 
of calendar days and not thedosin gcycles.
Patients with negative bone marrow at screening requi re no further bone marrow biopsy . 
Patients with positive bone marrow at screening must have a post-screening bone marrow 
biopsy to confirm CR/CR u within 28 days of first achieving radiological, clinical and 
biochemical CR/CRu. Post-screening bone marrow biopsies taken when the patient is not in 
CR/CRu that are negative also require no further bone marrow biopsy. At 120 weeks, patients 
with a positive bone marrow at screening who are in radiological, clinical and biochemical 
CR/CRu and who have not had a negat ive post-screening bone marrow biopsy must have a 
repeat bone marrow biopsy  at this time to confirm CR/CRu.
CT scans using contrast m edia are the preferred radi ology m ethod (MRI i s allowed in case of

Since the study endpo intis PFS based on CT, FDG PET scan is not the basis for disease 
progression. For suspected progression based on FDG-PET, a CT scan must be available 
demo nstrating unequivocal progressi on.
All protocol  defined efficacy assessm ents will  be conducted by Centra lReview including central 
radiology and clinical review by an IRC. Since thestudy endpo int is PFS based on CT as 
determined by IRC, progression will be based on CT scans.
For suspected progression based on clinical evalua tion, a CT scan must be available demonstrating 
unequivocal progressi on.
For equivocal progressi on based on CT findings, the site Inves tigator willcontact theprincipal 
investigator o f the study to determine whether the patient should remain on the study treatmen t. In 
some cases of equivocal progressi on, immediate central  reading of the CT scan in question may 
be requested prior to removing the pat ient from the study treatment. In such cases, if the PD isnot

10.3.5 Assessments for tumor flare
Tumor flare assessments are conducted in Cycle 1: Days 1, 8, and 15, and when clinically indicated 
thereafter for patients in the experimental arm and suggested for patients in the control arm.
Tumor flare reaction (TFR) is defined in the National Cancer Institute-Co mmonTermin ology 
Criteria f or Adverse Even ts (NC I-CTCAE) versio n 3 as a constella tion of signs and symptoms of 
tumor pain, inflamma tion of visible tumor, h yperca lcemia, diffuse bone pain, andother electrol yte 
disturbances in direct relation toinitiation of therapy  (NationalCancer Ins titute, 2003 ).
TFR is an adverse effect of lenalid omide previously reported in pa tients with CLL (Chana n-Khan ,
2008a ). TFR hasalso been reported at a  lower rate in clinical studi es of lenalid omidein patients
with non-Hodgkin lymph oma (NHL ) (Witzig, 2009). The characteris t icfindin g of TFR seen in
lymph oma patients treated wi th lenalid omide, is consist ent with f indings in patients wi th CLL; a 
sudden and tender increase in the size of the disease bearing sites, including the lymph nodes, 
spleen and/or the liver, t ypically acc ompanied bypain andsometimesaccompanie d by low- grade 
fever and non-pruritic di ffuse rash, typically  occurring in the first cycle (Chana n-Khan ,2008a; 
Witzig 2009). The increase in lymphadenopathy m ay be l ocalized or generalized . The onset of 
TFR has been as early as within a few hours after the first dose withthevast majori tyof TFR 
having occurred within the first 2 weeks.  When it occurs, TFR usually occurs within the first cycle
oftreatment but can recur to a lesser extent if the dose is increased (Celgene Corporat ion, 2009a ). 
Based on experience in Celgen e
-sponsored clinical studi es, TFR subsides over time and usually
resolves in 1- 2 weeks wit h or without interven tion ( Celgene Corporati on, 2009a ).
The experi ence with tumor flare in Celgen e-sponso red studi es of single agent lenalidomide in 
NHL is now summarized . Over 300 patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive or ind olent non-
Hodgkin’s lymph oma have received lenalido mide in three Phase 2 clinical studi es. Three studies

which evaluated lenalido mide 25 mg/day for 21days of a 28-day cycle in43previously  treate d
patients with i ndolentnon-Hodgkin lympho ma, 49 patients with relapsed/refractory  aggressive 
NHL, and 217 patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL, respectively . These protoco ls
suggested thatany pat ient who experi enced TFR during the first 1 to 2 weeks of  Cycle1may be 
treated symptomat ically wi thnon-stero idalanti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDS) . TFR occu rred in 
4 patients (grade 1 (n=1) and grade 2 (n=3)) in the NHL-001 study, none in theNHL-002 study; 
and 7 of 217 patients in the NHL-003 study(Grade 1 (n=2), Grade 2 (n=2) and Grade 3 (n=3).
I
n an inves tigato rinitiated study, Ahmadi et al in a single -center ,open-label PhaseIIstudy 
evaluated the use of lenalid omide, dexamethasone and rituximab in patients with relapsedor 
refractory indolent B- cell or MCL resistant to rituximab (Ahmadi  et al ., 2009 ). Am ong 24 patients,
Grade 1 TFR occurred in 1 patient with fo llicular lymph oma.
It is important to note that the increased lymphadenopathy seen inTFRmay mimic disease 
progression (PD). Therefore, careful monitoring andevaluation todifferen tiateTFR from PD is 
necessary foraddressin gtreatment of individual  patients including making decisi ons to 
discontinuetreatment (Chana n-Khan et al. 2008b ). There are currently n olaborator yor 
radiologicalteststhat dist inguis hTFR from PD. The dis tinction may be made on clinical grounds, 
incorporating observa tions such as timing of the event relativeto th estart of lenalid omide, 
associ ated physical findings, laboratory findings, and pace of disease before and afterinstitution
of len alidomid etreatment. Also, in case of TFR, inflamma tionandedema may reduce or disappear 
after short term  treatment wi th NSAID and/or corti costeroids .
Management of TFR is described in Sec tion9.1.1 .
10.3.6 Assessments for tumor lysis
Tumorlysis syndro me assessments are conducted in Cycle 1: Days 1, 8, and 15, and when 
clinically indicated thereafter for patients in the experimental arm and su ggested for pat ientsin the
controlarm.It is recommended that the patient be monitored for TLS during the first week of cycle 
1.Also, the site should make every effortto contact the patient on Day 5(±1 day) of the first cycle 
to inquire about the patient’s cond itionandtomake sure that he/she is continuin gwith TLS 
prophylaxis measures by keeping hydrated and taking the TLS prophylaxis as instructed. Any
patient contact that is made on Day 5 (± 1 day )shoul d be documented inpatient’s medical record 
and any  AEs th at are di scovered should be captured on the CRF.
Tumorlysis syndro me(TLS) is awell-known constella tion ofmetabolic abnormali tiesresul ting 
fromspontaneous or treatm ent-related tumor necrosis or fulminant apoptosi s. The metabo lic 
abnor malities include: hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia with secondar y 
hypocalcaemia with risk of renal failure. TLS has been reported in patients receiving rituximab 
plus lenalido mide and rituximab plus chemotherapy followed by ri tuximab.
The presence of known
risk factors such as bulky  disease, preexis ting(moderate )renal 
insufficiency, high ALC and high uric acid levels (> 8 mg/dL) prior to therapy are known to 
increase the likelihood of TLS. Early identification of patients at ri sk andthe preven tion of TLS

The experience with tumor lysis syndr o
me in Celgene -sponsore dstudies of single agent 
lenalid omide in NHL is summarized below. Three phase 2 multicenter, singl e-arm,open-label 
studiesevaluate d lenalid omide 25 mg/day for 21 days of a 28-day cycle in 43 previously treated 
patients
with i ndolent non-Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL-001), 49 patients with relapsed/refractory 
aggressive NHL (NHL-002), and 217 patients with relapsed/refractor yaggressive NHL (NHL-
003). All three studi es suggested that patients receive tumor lysis prophylaxis (allopurin olor 
equivalent) and be well hydrated during the first 7 days of lenalid omide administration in the first 
cycle or as clinically indicated. Grade 1 TLS occurred in 1 of the 309 (0.3%) patients receiving 
lenalid omide.
In an inves tigato rinitiated study,Dutia et al ., in a singl e-center, open-labelPhase IIstudy evaluated 
the use of lenalid omide and rituximab in patients with relapsed orrefractory indolent B-cellNHL
(Dutia, 2009). 2 of the first 4 patients treated using the lenalid omidedose of 25 mg developed 
tumor lysis
. Thus, the lenalido mide dose was reduced to 20 mg and allopuri nol prophylaxis was 
used in all subsequent patients with no further TLS events recorded. Inthe current study, it i s 
recommended that patients rando mized to the rituxima b-lenalid omidereceive allopurin ol
prophylaxis (see Section 9.3.1 for m ore inform ation).
10.3.7 Assessments for Venous Thromboembolic events (VTE)
VTE including Deep vein thrombosis and pulmo naryembolismwillbeassessed .
Deep vein thrombosis in Multiple Myeloma
In a number of randomized studi es lenalido mide has demonstrated a significan tly increased risk 
ofdeep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulm onary embo lism(PE) in patientswithmultiple 
myel oma who were treated with REVLIMID ® (lenalid omide )combina tion therapy (Revlimid®
Prescribing Informa tion, January 2009). In the pivotal trials for REVLIMID (lenalido mide) in
patients w
ith multi plemyel oma receiving lenalido mide plus dexamethasone, deep venous 
thrombosis and pulmo nary embo lismwere reported in 7.8% and 3.2% of patients, respectively 
compared to 3.2% and 0.9% of patients receiving placebo and dexamethasone. The Eastern 
Cooperative OncologyGroup (ECOG) trial (E4A03) evaluated lenalid omide 25 mg on Days 1 -21
p
lushigh - dose dexamet hasone 40 mg on Days 1-4, 9- 12 and 17- 20 of a 28 day  cycle (RD) versus
lenalid omide plus low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (Rd) in patients with
newl y-diagnosed MM.  Overall venous thromboemb olism(VTE) including DVT and PE occurred 
in 25% in the RD arm and 9% in the Rd arm (Rajkumar, 2007) . DVT prophylaxis was to be used 
in both arms. In two Phase III studi es (MM
-009) and (MM-010) of lenalid omide plus 
dexamethasone in pat ients with relapsed or refractory MM, thenumber of patients experiencing a 
thrombotic event in the lenalido mide/dexamethasone arm was 12% versus 4% in the 
dexamethasone alone arm (Revlimid Prescribing Informa t
ion, January 2009 ). Ananalysis of
pooleddatafromthe MM-009 andMM- 010studiesdemonstrated thromboemb olic events were 
significan tly higher in patients treated with lenalid omide/dexamethasone in absence of

Deep vein thrombosis in No
n-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
Ottinger et al (1995) analyzed incidence, risk factors, causes and prognostic significance of venous
thromboembo lism (VTE) inhigh-gradenon-Hodgkin ’s lymph oma (HG-NHL) in a prospective 
clinical trial. In 593 patients, theyreporte d a6.6% inci denc e of VTE , with 77% ofall cases 
occurring before or wi thin the first 3 m onths of chem otherapy . Vessel  compressi on by HG- NHL 
was i dentified as the leading cause of VTE.
I
nlymph omapatients receiving lenalid omide ,DVT and PE were reported in 7 (3.2%) and 6 (2.8%) 
of 266 patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL receiving lenalido mide in clinical 
studi es NHL-002 and NHL-003 ( Wiernik 2006 ;Witzig, 2011 ). DVT and PE were reported in 0 
(0%) and 1 (2.3%) of 43 patients with indolent relapsedrefractor yNHL (Witzig, 2009). Ant i-
thrombotic prophylaxis was not suggested in NHL-001 or NHL -002 but required for patients 
considered to be high risk o f developing DVT in NH L-003.
Unlike the increased risk ofDVT reported when adding lenalid omide todexamethasone in 
multiplemyel oma patient s, there is no evidence to suggest an increased risk ofDVT in lymph oma
patients receiving lenalid omide as single agent.
Nonetheless, in the current study, it i s recommended that patients randomized to the rituxima b-
lenalid omide who are considered to be at high risk for DVT re ceiveanti-thrombotic prophylaxis 
(see Section9.1.2 )andall patient s will be closely monitored for VTE including Deep vein

morpho logicalpattern and, in som e instances, further mo lecular or genetic analysis. A mandator y
patho logical review will be organized for all pa tients included in thetrial.Thegoalofthiscentra l 
review will  be to c onfirm the diagnosi s and to cl assify precisely the malignancy according to the 
WHO classifica tion 2008. The pathological review will be centralized at the LYS A-P,
forevery randomized pat ients.
Therefore for each patient, the invest igator will be requested to submit a registrati on form along 
with a copy ofthehistopatho logicalreport where the name and address of the pathologist having 
diagnosed the lymphom a will be easily identified aswell as a copy ofthe bone m arrowreport.
All the requested tum or paraffin embedded blocks fr om the f ormalin fixed sample (that was used 
for di agnosis), or 10 unstai ned slides, and bone marrow bi opsy (or 5 unstained slides wi th H&E) 
will be sent to theLYS A-P, France according to the process 
described in APPENDIX I.
Atrecept ion, routinely stained sections will be assessed and an appropri ate panel ofantibodies 
according to morphological aspects will be applied. When sufficient slides are available, a 
patho log ical review will be organized at the LYS A-P, and aconsens us diagnosis will be entered 
ontheLYS A-Pat hologyrevie wform. This LYS A-Patho logyrevie wformwill then be sent to the 
clinical coordinator and to the pathologist coordinator.
Initialtumor bl ock will also be used to make tissue microarray (TMA) and t issue core for DNA 
extract ion; both will be used to study theexpressi on of markers known to influence the prognosis 
of fol licular lymph oma.
When the review process is completed, tissue array  and tissue core analysis are completed, a 
patho logical report will besent to theinitial patho logist as well as the invest igator at the enrolling 
centre and the remaining pathologic material will be sent back to the ini tialpathologist.

Date : 08 Jan 2024 8013 ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1 Monitoring, Recording andReporting ofAdverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medicaloccurrence thatmay 
appear or worsen in a pati ent during the course of a stud y
. It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening conc omitantillness, aninjur y, or anyconcom itant impairment of the patient’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (i.e., anyclinically significant adverse change in the frequency orintensity of a pre-
existingcondi tion) shoul d be consi dered an AE. A di agnosis or syndrom e shoul d be recorded on 
the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or sympto m s ofthe diagnosi sor syndr ome.
An overdose, accidental  or intentional, whether or not it is associ ated with an AE, or abuse, 
withdrawa l,sensitivity or toxicity toaninves tigational product should be reported as an AE. If an 
overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and adverse event should be reported as separate
terms.
Signs, symptoms or physical findings indica tiveoflymphoma or progression oflymph oma should 
not be reported asan adverse event or serious adverse event. However, if a finding cannot be 
attributed with certain tyto lympho ma or progression oflymph oma,thisfindin g mu stbe reported 
as an adverse event or seriousadvers eevent , as applicable . For examples, 1)a findin g ofdyspnea
or pleuraleffusi o nin apatientexper iencing disease progression outside of the medias tinum or lung 
must be collected as an AE or SAE as applicabl ewhiledyspnea or pleura leffusi on in a patient
experiencing diseaseprogress ion in t he medias tinum or l ungmay be j udge d to be results of d isease
progression and therefore not reported as anAE or SAE; 2) a finding of bowel  obstruction in a 
patient experiencing disease progression outside of the bowel must be collected as an AE or SAE 
as applicable whilebowe lobstruct ion in a patient experiencing disease progressi on in the bowel 
may be judged to be results of disease progressio n.
All pat ients will  be monitored f or AEs during the study.Assessment s may i nclud e monitoring of 
any or all of the follo wing parameters: the patient’s clinical symptom s, laborator y,patho logica l, 
radiological orsurgica lfindings, physical examinat ion findings, or other appropriate tests and 
procedures.
AllAEs will be recorded bytheInvest igator fromthe time the patient signsinformed consent to
28 days afterthe lastdose ofstudydrug(s) .AEs andserious adverse events (SAEs) willbe recorded 
on the AE page of  the CRF and in the patient’ssourc edocu ments.AllSAE smustbe reported to 
Celgene Drug Safetyimmediately (i.e., within 24 hours of the Inves tigator’s knowl edge ofthe
event) by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form , or approved 
equivalent form.

Date : 08 Jan 2024 8113.2 Evaluation ofAdverse Events
Aqualified Inves tigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:
13.2.1 Seriousness
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dosethat:
Results in death;
Islife-threatenin g (i.e., in the opini on of the Investi gator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death fr om the AE);
Requ ires inpa tient hosp italiza tion or prolonga tion of existinghosp italizat ion
(hosp italiza tionisdefined as an inpatient admissi on,regard less of l ength ofstay);
Results in persistent or significant disabili ty/incapaci ty(a substan tial disruption ofthe patient’s
ability to conduct normal l ifefunct
ions);
Isacongenital anomaly/birth defect;
Cons titutes an important medical event.
Importan tmedical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or resul t in death, hospi taliza tion, or disabili ty, but may jeopard izethepatientor 
requi
re medica l orsurgical interven tion to prevent one of the ot her outcom es listed above. Medical 
and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should b e considered
serious.
SPM will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as serious adverse events 
regard less of thetreatmentarmthepatient is in (see Section 13.5). This includes any SPM, 
regard less of causal relationship to studydrug[s], occurring atanytime for the durati on of the 
study, fromthe time of signing the ICD up to and including the fo llow- up period of up to 10 years. 
Events of SPM are to be reported using the SAE report form and must be considered an “Important 
Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be docu mented in 
the appropriate page(s) of theCRF and patient’s source documents. Docu mentation on the
diagnosis of the second primary malignancy  must be provi ded at the time ofreport ing as a serious
adverse event (e.g., anyconfi
rmatoryhisto logy or cy tologyresults, X-rays,CTscans, etc.).
Events notconsidere dto be SAEs are hospitalizati ons fo r:
A standard procedure for protocol therapy administrat ion.  However, hospi taliza tion or
prolonged hospi taliza tion for a complica tion of therapy  administrati on will be reported as an 
SAE.
Routine treatme nt or m onitoring of thestudi edindicationnotassoc iated with any deter ioration
incondi tion.
The administration of blood or platelet transfusi on as routine treatm ent of  studied indica tion. 
However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospi talizati on for a complication of such transfusio n 
remains a reportable SAE.
A procedure for protocol/diseas e-related inves tigations (e.g., surger y, scans, endoscop y,
samplingfor laborator ytests, bone m arrowsampling). However, hosp italizat ion or prolonged 
hospi taliza tion for a complication of such procedures remains a reportable SAE.

endoscop y,samplin gfor laborator ytests, bone m arrow sam pling).
Hospitalization or prolonga tionofhospitalizat ion for technical, pract ical, or social reasons, in 
absence of an AE.
A procedure that is planned (i.e., planned prior to starting of treatm ent on study); must be 
docum ented in the source docum ent and the CRF.  Hospitaliza t
ionor prolonged hospit alization
for a complica tionremains a reportable SAE.
Anelective treatment of a pr e-existin gcondi tion unrelated to the studied indica tion.
Emergency outpat ienttreatment or observatio n that does not result in admissi on, unless 
fulfilling other seriousn esscriteria above.
If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Inves tigator will provide inform ation on severi ty,start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug(s) ,actiontaken regarding study drug(s), and outcome.
13.2.2 Severity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Inves tigator mustassess theseveri ty of theevent.
Theseveri ty/intensity of AEswill be graded based upon the pati ent’s symptom s according to the 
current active minor version ofNationalCancer Institute (NCI) Comm onTermin ology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE, Versi on 4.03); http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/
electroni c_applica tions/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE should be evaluated forseveri ty/intensityaccording 
to the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild –trans ient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no m edica l 
interven tion/therapy required
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild tomoderate limita tion in activity,some assistance m aybe needed ; no 
or minimal medical interven tion/therapy required
Grade 3 = Severe –marke dlimita tion in activity,some assistance usually requi red; medica l 
interven tion/therapy required,hosp italizat ion is possible
Grade 4 = Life threatening –extre melimitationinactivi ty,significant assistance requi red;
significant m edical  interven tion/therapy required,hosp italizat ion or hospi ce care probable
Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death]
Specific NCI Working Group or other criteria pertinent to the indicat ion may also be used as 
applicable.
Theterm “severe” is often used to describe the intensi ty of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial  infarc tion) ; the event itself, however, may be of relativelymino rmedical 
significance (such as severe headache). This criteri on is notthe same as “serious” which is based

life or functioning.
Seriousness, notseveri ty,serves as a gu ide for defining regulatory obliga t ions.
13.2.3 Causality
The Invest igator must determine the rela tionship between the administration ofstudydrug(s )and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not related or related as defined below:
Not related: Thetempora lrelationship of the adverse event to studydrug(s) 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely or remote ,
orother medicat ions,therapeut icinterventi ons, or underlying
condi tions provi de asufficient explanat ion fo r the observed eve nt.
Related: Thetempora lrelationship of the adverse event to studydrug(s) 
administration makesa causal relationship possibl e, and other 
medica tions, therapeutic interven tions,orunderlying conditio ns do 
not provi de a sufficient explana tion for the observed event.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary  or addi tionalstudy 
drug(s) that has not been manufactured or provided bySponsor , pleaseprovide the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
13.2.4 Durati on
For both AEs and SAEs, the invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
13.2.5 Action Taken
The Invest igator will report the action taken with study drug(s) as a resul t of an AE or SA E, as 
applica ble (e.g., discon tinuationorreduction of IP, as appropri ate) and report if concomitant and/o r
additional treatm ents were given for the event.
13.2.6 Outcome
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discon tinuati on of the patient’s participati on in the study 
must be fo llowed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered (death due to another 
cause) or death (due to the SA E).
13.3 Abnormal laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is consi dered to be an AE if the abnor mality:
results in discon tinuationfrom the study;
requires treatment, modifica tion/ interruption of study drug(s) dose, or anyother therapeut ic 
interven tion; or
isjudged to be of significant clinical importance.

13.4 Pregnancy
The Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Plan (PPP) applies to all subjects receiving lenali domide 
within a clinical trial. See APPENDIX H.Refer to approved product/prescribing informat ion for 
further informat ion on rituximab pregnancy restrictions. 
13.4.1 Females of Childbearing Potential
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a posit ive pregnancy  test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female patient occurring while the patient is on IP, or within 28 days of the 
patient’s last dose of IP , are consi dered immediate ly reportable events.  Invest igationalproduct is
to be discont inued immediately and the patient instructed to return any unused portion o f the IP to
the Investigator .  The pregnancy , suspected pregnancy , or posit ive pregnancy test must be reported 
to Celgene Drug Safet y immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Initial 
Pregnancy Report Form , or approved equivalent form .The exposure of any pregnant female (eg, 
caregiver or pharmacist) to lenalido mide is also an immediately reportable event.
The female pat ient shoul d be referred to an obstetrician -gyneco logist, preferably  one experienced 
in reproductive toxicit y for further evaluat ion and counseling.  
The Investigator will fo llow the female pat ient until co mpletion o f the pregnancy, a ndmust notify 
Celgene Drug Safet y immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (eit her normal or abnormal 
outcom e) using the Follow -up Pregnancy  Report Form, orapproved equivalent form.
If the outcom e of the pregnancy was abnorm al (eg, spontaneous or therapeutic aborti on), the

the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safetyimmediately by 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowl edge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, orapproved equivalent form .
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth shoul d be reported, without regard to 
causalit y, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Invest igator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y

13.5 Reporting ofSerious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form  in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page of the CRF. Signs, symptom s or physical findings 
indica tiveoflymphoma or progression oflymph oma shoul dnot be reported as serious adverse 
event. However, if a finding cannot be attributed with certain tyto lympho ma or progression of 
lymph oma,this finding must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as 
applicable. AllSAEs must be reported toCelgen eDrugSafety (i.e., within 24 hours of the 
Inves tigato r’s knowl edge oftheevent) by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form. This instruction pertains to ini tialSAE reports as well 
as any follow-up r eports.
SPM will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as serious adverse events 
regard less
ofthetreatmentarmthepatient is in. This includes any SPM, regardl ess of causal 
relationship to study drug[s], occurring atanytime for the d uration of thestudy , fromthe time of 
signing the ICD up to and including the follow-up period of 10 years. Events of SPM are to be 
reported using the SAE report form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even i
f
no other serious criteria ap ply;theseevent s must also be docu mented intheappropri atepage(s) of 
the CRF and patient ’ssourc edocu ments.Docu mentat ion on the diagnosis of the second primar y
malignancy must be provi ded at the time of reporti ng as a serious adverse event (e.g.,any
confirmatory histo logy or cy tologyresults, X-rays, CT scans, etc.).
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent. This 
requirement applies to all  SAEs (regardl ess of  relati onship to study drug(s) )thatoccurduringthe 
study (fromthe time the patient signs informed consent to 28 days after the last dose of study drug 
(s)), and those made known to th e Inves tigator at anytime thereafter that are suspected of being 
related to study drug(s). SAEs occurring p rior to treatment will be captured.
The SAE report shoul d provi de a detailed descrip tion of the SAE and include summaries of 
hosp italrecords and other relevant docum ents. If a patient died and an autopsy hasbeen performed,
copies of the autopsy report and death certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug Safetyas soon as 
these become available. Any follow-up data will be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form , 
or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgen eDrugSafety.
Where requi red by local legislation,theInves tigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of 
the SAE and providing them with all relevant initialand follow-up infor m atio n about the event.

14.1 Overview
The objective of this statistical analysis is to investigate efficacy andsafety of ri tuximab plus 
lenalid omide versus rituximab pluschem otherapy followed by rituximab in patients wi th 
previously untreated f ollicular lympho ma.
Efficacy determinat ion will be based upon the co-pr imaryendp oints of complete response 
(CR/CRu) rate a t 120 weeks and PFS assessed by the IRC using the IWG (Cheson , 1999 )criteria. 
The primary analysi s ofcomplete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks will be accompanie d by 
statisticalvalida tion thatthis endp oint ispredic tive of PFS, and the study willcontinue to final 
PFS analysis.
The evaluat ion ofpotent ialsurrog ate endpoint to PFS will be detailed in a separate statistical 
analysis plan.  This protocol  might be amended according to the surrogacy valida tion results.
Allstatistical analyses specified in this protocol  will be conducted using SAS®versio n 9.1.3 or 
higher.

Date : 08 Jan 2024 8814.3 Sample Size andPower Considerations
Sample size calcula tion is based on provi ding adequate power to eval uate treatm ent effect on the 
co-primar yefficac yendp oints.
Theco-primar yefficac yendp ointsarecomplete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks and PFS. 
To fulfill the primary objec tive of the study, it must be shown that the experimental arm is super ior
tothecontrolarmat=0.05 level based onCR/CRu rate at 120 weeks which could be the basis 
for an early approval or based on PFS to obtain full approval (Shih, 2003) .
I
t ishypothe sizedthatthe comp lete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks is 60% in the control 
armand 72% in the experimental  arm.  For 90% power to detect this difference wi th two-sided
= 0.05, a total of 644patients (322 in each arm) will be requi red. The power calculat ion for the
response rates is perform ed using EAST v5.4 software based on the large sample z-test with 
unspooled variance estimate.
It ishypothes izedthatthe medianPFS is 83 m onths in thecontro larm,andthere is a 30% increase
in the median PFS in the experimental arm (corresponding hazard ratio of 0.7692).  For80% power 
to de tect thi s difference with two-sided α= 0.05, a total of 456 progressi on/rel apse/death events 
will be required.
Considering the sample size requi rements for both co -primary endpoints, it is planned to enroll a 
total of approximately 1000 pat ients into the study .With this sample size, the power to detect the 
difference of 12% of co mplete response (CR/CRu) rate betwe en arms will be 98%.
Therefore, for an enrollment rate of 10 patients per m onth in the first six months, 25 patients per 
month in the next 11 months, and 30 patients per m onths thereafter with 6% dropout rate per year, 
a total of 1000 patients in 1:1 ratio to the two treatm ent arms (500 in each arm) will be needed,
with a 40-mont h accrual period and up to 10 years f ollow-up. The analysis ofPFS will occu r in
abou t 142 m onths when the required 456 progressio n/relapse/death events are expected to be 
observed or,at the latest,when 9.5 years of median follow
-up hasbeen reached, whichever 
occurs first.
Theassump tions used in sample size calcula tionsarederiv ed fromavailable literature, especially 
from th e published results of PRIMA and STiL studies. For the proposed sample size of N = 1000 , 
it should be noted that anyreasonable devia tions from th eseassump tions have limited impact on 
thepower of the test. For example, ifthe comp lete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks is down 
to50% in the control  arm instead of 60%, the proposed sample size of 1000 patients still have 
roughly  97%power to detect a 12% rate difference. If the median PFS reduces to 70 months in the 
c
ontrolarm instead of 83 m onths, it still requi res a total  of 456 events to detect a 30% increase in 
the median PFS, and the only impact is that the study durat ion will be reduced to 113 months if
1000 patients are to be rand omized .
A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that the CR rate at 30 months is well correl ated with 
PFS. The point estimate and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the trial -level  surrogacy 
measures R2WLSand R2Copula were 0.88 [0.77 to 0.96] and 0.86 [0.72 to 1.00], respectively. The

Therefore it was decided to include a sec ondary endpoint of the co mplete response (CR) rate at 
120 weeks by IWG 1999.
The proposed sample size of 1000 patients have 90% power to detect a 10% difference in CR rate 
at 120 weeks with two-sided ( α= 0.05), assuming a 50% CR rate at 120 weeks in the control arm 
and corresponding to an odds ratio (OR) of 1.5. The power calculation for the response rates is 
performed using EAST v5.4 software based on the large sample z-test with unspooled variance estimate.
14.4 Background and Demographic Characteristics
Patient’s age, height, weight, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum), while gender, race and 
other categorical variables will be provided using frequency tabulations. Me dical histor y data will 
be summarized using frequency tabulations by system organ class and preferred term.
Patient’s demographics and baseline characteristi cs will be summarized fo r the ITT population. 
Patient disposition (analysis population allocation, randomized, discontinued, along with pr imary
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both treatment
arms. Protocol deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations.
14.5 Efficacy Analysis
14.5.1 Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints
Complete Response   (CR/CRu) Rate at 120 weeks
The tumor response data will be assessed by the IRC using the IWG ( Cheson, 1999 ) criteria. Based 
on the CT/MRI schedule, any assessments in a time window of 120 weeks ± 4 weeks are qualified 
as the 120 week assessments. If two or more assessments are performed in this time window, the assessment with the least favorable response will be used.
If a patient discontinues the treatment prior to this time window due to disease progressi on, that 
patient is classified as a non-responder at 120 w eeks. If a patient discontinues the treatment prior 
to this time window due to any other reasons , the CT/MRI assessments should continue as 
scheduled until disease progression. If a patient whose disease was not progressed prior to this 
time window does not have any tumor assessments in this time window, that patient is also 
considered as a non-responder for this primary endpoint.
Progression Free    Survival (PFS)
PFS is an accepted endpoint of clinical benefit for previously untreated FL patient and was the 
basis for the recent approval of rituximab maintenance in this population ( Salles, 2011 ). The 
disease progression statu s will be assessed by IRC using the IWG ( Cheson, 1999 ) criteria. PFS is 
defined as the time from randomization into the study to the first observation of documented

censored at the time of last visit wi th adequate assessment. If a p atientreceive dotheranti-cancer 
treatment for fol licular lympho ma before progressio n, the CT/MRI assessments shou ld continue 
asscheduled until disease progression or death which will be counted as events.
Various censoring rules will be considered in sensitivity analyses. Detailed censoring rules for 
PFS will be provi ded in the Statis ticalAnalysis Plan based on “Guidance for industry :Clinical 
trial endpoints for the approval  of cancer drugs and biologics” (see reference 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory Informatio n/Guidances/

Primary Endp oint In Confirmatory Trials For Registrat ion” 
(http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/ewp/26757506en.pdf ).
14.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The following secondary efficacy  endpo ints will be analyzed using appropriate statist ical methods.
Com plete Response (CR) Rate at 120 weeks by  IWG 1999
Event Free Survival (EFS) by IWG 1999
Time toNext Anti-Lymph oma Treatment (TTNLT)
Overall Survival (OS)
EFS will be measured fr om th e date of rand omizati on to the date of first documented progression,
relapse, andinitiation ofanew anti-lymph oma treatm ent or death by any cause. Responding 
patients and patients who are lost to fo llow up will be censored at their l asttumor assessment date.
TTNLT will be measured from th e date of randomization to the date of first documented 
administration of any n ew anti-lymph oma treatment (chemotherap y,radiotherapy,radio-
immunotherap y,immunotherap y). Pati entscontinuingin response or who are lost to follow-up 
will be censored on their last visit date. Patients who died (due to anycause) before having received
anewanti-lymph omatreatment willbeincluded inthestatisticalanalysi s with death being counted 
as an even t.
The OS will be measured fromdate of randomization to the date of death.  Patients who die, 
regard less of  the cause of death, will  be considered to have had an event.  Pati ents who wi thdraw 
consent for the study will be considered censored at the time of with drawal . Patientswho complete

14.5.4 Analysis Method
Theco-primar yefficac yendp oints are the complete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks and the 
PFS. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT popula tion. Analysis based on the
mITTpopu lation is supportive.
For the co -primary endpo int CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks, the number and percent of patients with
CR/CRu at120 weeks willbe tabulated by treatmentarm. The experimental  arm will be decl ared 
superi or if the tw o
-sidedp-valuefroma chi-squar etest is ≤ 0.05 in favor of the experimental arm. 
The primary analysis will be performed using a stratified Cochra n-Mante l-Haenszel (C MH)testto
adjust for possible confounding effects of the stratifica tion factors: FLIPI score (0 -1vs2vs3-5),
Age (>60 vs<60),l
ongest d iameter of the largest node (> 6 v < 6 cm ). The u n-stratified test will 
be a supportive analysis.
For the co-primary endpo int PFS, theKapla n-Meier estimates of PFS function will be prov ided. 
If apatienthas amissin g orincomplete CT scan, all other available CT scans or MRIs of the patient
will st ill be used for the analysis. The experimental arm will be declared superior if the two-sided
p-valuefro m a stratified log-rank test i s ≤0.05 infavor ofthe experimental  arm. Convent ionally ,

95%CI.The un- stratified log-rank test will be a supporti ve analysis. Subgroup analysis for PFS 
will be perfo rmed as appropriate.
The secondary efficacy endpo ints are CR rate at 120 weeks, EFS, TTNLT, and OS. In order to 
control  an overall two-
sided 0.05study-wise Ty pe I error rate, a fixed-sequence gate -keeping 
procedure will be employ ed to interpret the analysis resul ts of these secondar yefficac yendpo ints
intheorder ofCR rate at 120 weeks, EFS, TTNLT, andOS.
Step 1: If the result of CR rate at 120 weeks fails to reach the 2-side d 0.05 significanc e level, no
efficacy  claimswill be made for these secondary endpo ints.Ifthe p-valuefro m the CR rate at 120 
weeks ≤0.05, the efficacy  claim for CR rate at 120 weeks will be made, and further testing will 
be perform ed in the Step 2 .
Step 2: If the resul t of EFS analysis fails to reach the 2-sided0.05 si gnificanc e level, no efficacy 
claimswill be made for theremaining three secondary endpo ints.Ifthe p-valuefro m the EFS
analysi s ≤0.05, the efficacy  claim for EFS will be made, and further testing will be performed in 
the Step 3.
Step 3: If the result of TTNLT analysis fails to reach the 2-sided 0.05 si gnificance level, no efficacy
claims will be made for the remaining twosecondary endpoints. Ifthep-valuefro m th e TTNL T
analysi s≤ 0.05, the efficacy claim for TTNLT will be made, and further testing will be performed
intheStep 4.
Step 4: If the resul t of OS analysis fails to reach the 2-sided 0.05 si gnificanc e level, no efficac y 
claim will be made for the OS endpoints. If the p -valuefrom the OSanalysis ≤ 0.05, the efficacy 
claim for the OS be m ade.
14.6 Safety Analysis
Safetyanalysis will include all patients in the Safety population.   
Stud y medicat ion exposure will be summarized for each treatment arm including duration o f study
medica tion, totaldose taken, and dose reducti ons.
Adverse events, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory measurements, and conco mitant 
medica tions will be summarized b ytreatmentarm.
AEs will be coded according to medical dictionary for drug regul atory activities(MedDRA) and 
classified using the National  Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events 
(NCI CTCAE). The incidence rates of AEs will be tabulated by systemorgan class and preferred

SPM, events of all CTCAE grade severi ties, suspected treatmen t-related AEs, and events that 
resulted in with drawa l ofstudy medica tion. The most severe grade of each preferred term for a 
patientwill be utilized for summaries of adverse events by NCI CTCAE grade. All AEs with 
corresponding attributes will be displayed in a by-patientlisting. Adverse events leading to de ath

14.7 Interim Analysis
14.7.1 Interim Analysis for futility
For the co-primar yendp oint ofthe complete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks, two interim 
analyses forfutilityare pre-pl anned :
The first interim analysis will be performed when the first 200 patients have their response 
assessments done at 6 months of treatm ent, or have had disease progressi on or died prior to 
this timep oint.
The second interim analysis will be performed when the first 200 patients have their response 
assessments done at 120 weeks, or have had disease progression or died prior to this timep oint.
Theintention of these two interim futility analyses is to assess risk-benefit and ensure patient 
safet
y. Thepropose d futilityboundar iesarenon-binding.  The results of these two futility analyses 
will be reviewed by the independent DMC to make recommendation of go/no go.
Ther e is no pl antoclaim efficacy super ioritybased on these interim resul ts, therefore, no T ype I
error rate adjustment is needed.
As similarly define dfortheprimar yefficac yendpoint ,anyassessments in a time window of 24 
week s ± 4 weeks are qualified as the 6 months assessments. If two or more assessments are 
performed in this time window, the as sessment with the least favo rable response will be used.
If a patientdiscont inues the treatm ent prior to th is time window due to disease progressi on, that 
patientis classified as a no n-responde r at 6 mont hs. If a patientdiscont inues the t reatm entprior to 
this time window due toanyother reasons, the CT/MRI assessments should con tinueas schedule d
until disease progression.  If a pat ientwhose di sease was not progressed prior to this time window 
does not have any tumor assessments in this time window, thatpatientisalso considered as a no n-
responder for this endp oint.
Forthefirstfutilityanalysis, possible resul ts of the CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks for 644patients will 
be simulated according to the f ollowing assumpti ons.Thesimulated result s will thenbe analyzed 
to establish the first fu tilityboundar y.
Based on the PRIMA study results,thefollowingassumpt ionsare made for simula tions:
1.For the first 100 patients in the control arm when their response data at 6 months are observed, 
their observed CR/CRu rate at 6 m onths is estimated approximately 58% to62%, and their 
observed ORR is approximately 88% to 92%.
2.Inthecontrol arm,among the pati ents who have CR/CRu observed at 6 m onths there willbe
a0.75 probabili ty for them to remain in CR/CRu at 120 weeks, and among the patients who 
have PR observed at 6 months there will be a 0.50 probabili ty for themto convert to CR/CRu 
at 120 weeks.

param eter -2.5 will be applied. It is estimated that around 228 PFS events (ie, 0.50 informat ion) 
woul d occur at the first interim PFS analysis, and 342 PFS events (ie, 0.75 informat ion) are 
requi red at the second interim PFS analysis. The final PFS analysis will be perform ed based on a 
total of 456 PFS events or,at the latest,when 9.5 years of median follow-up hasbeen reached, 
whichever occurs first. A statist ically significant treatm ent effect on PFS will be reached if the 
two-sided p -value is  ≤ 0.011 at the first interim PFS analysis, or ≤ 0.019 at the second interim PFS 
analysis, or ≤ 0.039 at the final PFS analysis.

Date : 08 Jan 2024 9614.8 Final Analysis
The final analysis will be performed :
for the co-primary endpo int CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks: when all randomized patients have 
their response assessments done at 120 weeks, or have had disease progression or died prior to 
the 120 -week assessment, 
for the co -primary endpoint PFS: when the required 456 progression/relapse/death events have 
occurred am ong all randomized patients or, at the latest ,when 9.5 years of median follow-up 
hasbeen reached, whichever occurs first .
The al pha level for the final analysis may be adjusted based on the total  number of  PFS events if 
the study  is terminated prior to accumulat ing the originally planned 456 events. The secondar y 
endpo int CR rate at 120 weeks will be analy zedwhen all randomized patien ts have their response 
assessments done at 120 weeks, or have had disease progressi on or died prior to the 120 week 
assessment.
In order to control the alpha for the other secondary  endpo ints EFS, TTNLT and OS, the final 
analysis of these endpo ints will beperformed at the time of the final PFS analysis, and only 
descript ive statistics (Kaplan -Meier estimates, median, etc.) will be reported without formal 
statist ical comparison at the time of the final CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks analysis.

15.1 Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)
Anindependent external Data Safet y Moni toring Committee (DSMC) will periodically  review 
ongoing safetydata throughout the study and make recommendat ions to the sponsor for any safety
concerns.
Inaddition,the DSMC will also review efficacy data for futility. In particular, DSMC will conduct
twoearly futilityanalyses. The first futilityanalysis is to evaluate the complete response (CR/CRu) 
rate as determined by IRC at 6 months o f treatment for the first 200 patients. The DSMC will also  
review the results of the pre- planned interim analysis described above.
15.2 Independent Review Committee (IRC)
Forcomplete response rate assessment an independent review of all CT scans according to an 
independent review charter.
Bone marrow re-examina tions will be conducted at the clinical sites .
Patients wi th negative bone marrow at screening require no further bone marrow biopsy. Patients 
with positive bo ne marrow at screening must have a post-screening bone marrow biopsy to confirm 
CR/CRu within 28 days of first achieving radiological, clinical and biochemical CR/CRu. Post-
screening bone marrow biopsies taken when the patient is not in CR/CRu that are negat ive also 
requi re no further bone marrow biopsy. At 120 weeks, patients with a positive bone marrow at 
screening who are in radiological , clinical and biochemical CR/CRu and who have not had a 
negat ive post-screening bone marrow bi opsy  must have a repeat bone m arrow bi opsy  at this time 
to confirm CR/Cru.

about the protocol, amendments, studytreatments, as well as study-relate d duti es and functions. 
The Invest igator shoul d maintain a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified 
persons to whom he or she has delega t
ed significant study-related duti es.
The Investi gator i s responsible for keeping a record of all  patients who sign an infor med consent  
docu mentandarescreened forentry into the study . Patients who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the patient’s source documents.
The Invest igator, or a designated member of the Invest igator’s staff, must be available during 
m
onitoring visits to review data, resolve queri es and allow direct access to patient records (e.g., 
medical records, office charts, hospitalcharts, and study-related charts) for source data 
verification. The Inves tigator must ensure timely and accurate completion ofCRFs and querie s.
16.2 Sponsor Responsibilities

EQ-5D
EQ-5D i s a standardized measure of health status developed bytheEuroQo lGrou p inorderto 
provide a simple, generic measure of health fo r clinical and econ omicappraisal (EuroQo lGroup,
1990). Applicable toawiderange ofhealthcondi tions and treatm ents, it provides a simple 
descrip tive profile and produces a single index value for health status that can be used in the 
clinical andecon omicevalua tion of healthcare aswell asinpopulati onhealthsurveys.
EQ-5D essen tiallyconsists of 2 pages - the EQ-5D descrip tive system (page 2) and the EQ visual 
analogue scale (EQ VAS) (page 3). The EQ-5D descrip tivesystem comprisesthe following 5 
dimensi ons: m obility,self-care, usual activities, pain/disc omfortandanxie ty/depress ion. Each 
dimensi onhas 3 levels: no problems, some problems, severe problems. The respondent is asked to 
indicate his/her healt h state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate 
statement in each of the 5 dime nsion s. This decisi on resul ts in a 1-digit number expressing the 
level selected for that dimensi on. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5 -digit number 
describing the responden t’shealthstate. Atotal of 243 possible health states are defined in this 
way. Eachstate is referred to in terms of a 5 d igit code. For example, state 11111 indicates no 
probl ems on any  of the 5 dimensi ons, while state 11223 indicates no probl ems wi th mo bilityand 
self care, some prob lems with performing usual activi ties, m oderate pain or disco mfort and 
extrem e anxie tyor depressi on.It shoul d be noted that the numerals 1-3 have no arithmet ic 
properties and should not be used as a cardinal score.
TheEQVAS records t
heresponden t’sself-ratedhealthon a verti cal, 0 -100 visual analogue scale 
where 100
=“Best imaginable health state” and 0 = “Worst imaginable healt h state”. This 
infor matio n canbe used as a quan titative measure of healt h outcom e as judged by the individua l 
respondents.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be used as a measure of health-relatedquali ty of life. 
TheQLQ -C30 iscomposed of both multi-it em scales and single item measures. These include five
functionalscales (physical , role, em otional, cogni tive and soci al), three symptom  scales (fatigue,
nausea/v omiting, and pain), a global healthstatus/QOL scale, and six single items (dyspnoea, 
insomnia, appet iteloss,constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficul ties). Each of the multi-item 
scales includes a different set of items – no i temoccurs in more than one scale.
TheQLQ -C30employs a week recall peri od for all items and a 4 -point scale for the func tional and 
symptom  scales/i tems with response categori es "Not at all, ""A little," "Qui te a bit"and "Ver y
much."Thetwo items assessing global health status/QOL utilize a 7-point scale ranging fro m 1
(“Very Poor”) to7(“Excellent”).
All of th e scales and single item measures range in score from 0- 100. A high score represents a 
higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high/heal t
hylevelof 
functioning, a high score for t he gl obalhealthstatus/QOL represents a high/good QOL, but a high 
score for a symptom  scale/i tem represents a high level ofsympto matology/problems. (Aaronson 
et al., 1993 )

MANAGEMENT PLAN
1 LENALIDOMIDE PREGNAN CY PREVENTION PLAN F OR SUBJECTS IN 
CLINICAL TRIALS
The Pregnancy  Prevent ion Plan (PPP) applies to all subjects receiving lenalido mide within a 
clinical trial. The following PPP documents are included: 
1.The Lenalido mide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable 
Birth Control  Methods docum ent (Secti on 2)provides the fo llowing informat ion:
Potenti al risks to the fetus associated with lenalidomide exposure
Definit ion of female of childbearing potential (FCBP)/female not of childbearing potential 
(FNCBP)
Requi rements for counseling of all subjects receiving lenalido mide about pregnanc y 
precauti ons and the potential risks of fetal exposure to lenalido mide
Acceptable birth control  methods for both female subjects of childbearing potenti al and 
male subjects receiving lenalido mide in the study
Pregnancy testing requirements for subjects receiving lenalidomide who are FCBP
2.The Lenalido mide Educat ion and Counseling Guidance Docum ent for each gender (female 
and male; Secti on 3and Secti on4respect ively) must be completed and signed by a trained 
counselor at the part icipating clinical center pri or to each di spensing of lenalido mide. A copy 
of this docum ent m ust be m aintained in the subject’s records for each dispense.
3.The Lenalido mide Inform ation Sheet (Section 5) will be given to each subject receiving 
lenalido mide. The subject must read this docum ent pri
or to starting lenalido mide and each time 
the subject receives a new supply o f lenalido mide.
2 LENALIDOMIDE RISKS O F FETAL EXPOSURE, PR EGNANCY TESTING 
GUIDELINES AND ACCEP TABLE BIRTH CONTROL MET HODS
2.1 Risks Associated with Pregnancy
Lenalido mide is structurally related to thalido mide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogeni c 
active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. An embry ofetal development 
study  in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformat ions in the offspring of female 
monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy. A teratogenic effect of lenalido mide in humans 
cannot be ruled out. Therefore, a pregnancy prevention program must be fo llowed.
2.1.1 Definition o f Females of Childbearing Potential
A FCBP is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea 
following cancer therapy  does not ruleout childbearing potenti al) for at least 24consecut ive 
months (ie, has had menses at any t ime in the preceding 24 consecut ive months).
2.1.2 Definition of Females Not of Childbearing Potential
Females who do not meet the above definit ion of FCBP should be clas sified as FNCBP.

2.2.1 Females of Childbearing Potential
For a FCBP, lenalido mide is contraindicated unless all o f the fo llowing are met (ie, all FCBP must 
be counseled concerning the fo llowing ri sks and requi rements pri or to the start of lenalidomide ): 
She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child
She understands the need for effect ive contracepti on, without interrupti on, 28 days before 
starting lenalido mide, throughout the entire durati on of lenalido mide, during dose interruptio ns 
and for at least 28 day s after the l ast dose of lenalidomide
She understands and agrees to inform the Investi gator if a change or stop of method of 
contraception is needed
She m ust be capable of complying with effect ive contraceptive measures
She is informed and understands the potenti al consequences of pregnancy and the need to 
notify her study  doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy
She understands the need to commence lenalidomide as soon as it is dispensed following a 
negat ive pregnancy te st
She understands and accepts the need to undergo pregnancy testing based on the frequency 
outlined in this plan (Section 2.4) and in the Informed Consent
She acknowledges that she understands the hazards lenalidomide can cause to an unborn fetus 
and the necessary  precaut ions associated with the use of lenalido mide.
The Investigator must ensure that a FCBP:
Com plies with the condi tions of the pregnancy prevent ion plan, including confirmat ion that 
she has an adequate l evel of understanding
Acknowledges the aforement ioned requirements.
2.2.2 Females Not of Childbearing Potential
For a FNCBP, l enalido mide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met (i e, all  FNCBP 
must be counseled concerning the following risks and requi rements prior to the start of 
lenalido mide): 
She acknowledges she understands the hazards lenalido mide can cause to an unborn fetus and 
the necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalido mide.
2.2.3 Males
Traces of lenalido mide have been found in semen. Male subjects taking lenalido mide must meet 
the following condi tions (ie, all males must be counseled concerning the following risks and 
requi rements pri or to the start of lenalidomide):
Understand the potential teratogeni c risk if engage d in sexual  activi ty with a pregnant f emale 
or a FCBP
Understand the need for the use of a condom  even if he has had a vasectomy , if engaged in 
sexual activit y with a pregnant female or a FCBP
Understand the potential teratogenic risk if the subject donate s semen or sperm.

Date : 08 Jan 2024 1252.3 Contraception
2.3.1 Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential
Females of childbearing potential enro lled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable forms of 
contraception simul taneously or to practice complete abstinence (True abstinence is acceptable 
when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or post -ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.) from heterosexual co ntact during the fo llowing time periods related to 
this study : 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalido mide; 2) while taking lenalidomide; 3) 
during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalido mide. 
The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly  effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. If the below contraception methods are not appropriate for 
the FCBP, she must be referred to a qualified provider of contraception methods to determine the 
medically effect ive contracepti on method appropriate to the subject. The following are examples 
of highly  effect ive and addit ional effective methods of contraception:
Examples of highly  effect ive methods:
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Horm onal (birth control  pills, injections, implants, levonorgestrel -releasing intrauteri ne 
system  [IUS], medroxyprogesterone acetate depot inject ions, ovulation inhibitory 
progesterone- only pills [e.g. desogestrel])
Tubal ligat ion
Partner’s vasectomy
Examples of a dditional effect ive methods:
Male condom
Diaphragm
Cervical Cap
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of 
infect ion at the time of insert ion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylact ic antibiot ics should be 
considered particularly in subjects with neutropenia. 
2.3.2 Male Subjects
Male subjects must practice complete abstinence (True abstinence is acceptable when this is in 
line with the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal or post -ovulation methods] and wit hdrawal are not acceptable methods 
of contraception.) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a 
FCBP while taking lenalido mide, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days after the last 
dose of lenalido mide, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 
2.4 Pregnancy Testing
Medically  supervised pregnancy  tests with a minimum sensi tivity of 25mIU/mL must be 
perform ed for FCBP.

What is the most important information I should know about lenalidomide?
1.Lenalidomide may cause birth defects (def ormed babies) or death of an unborn baby.
Lenalido mide is similar to the medicine thalido mide. It is known that thalidomide causes 
life-threatening bi rth defects.
If you are a female who is able to become pregnant:
Do not take lenalidomide if you are pregn ant or plan to become pregnant
You must practice complete abstinence from sexual contact with a male or use two 
reliable, separate forms of effective birth control at the same time: 
for 28 days before starting lenalido mide
while taking lenalido mide 
durin g breaks (dose interruptions) of lenalidomide 
for at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide 
You must have pregnancy testing done at the following times:
within 10 to 14 day s prior to the first dose of lenalidomide

RV-FOL -GELARC -0683C Amendment 5 
Date : 08 Jan 2024 135APPENDIX I PATHOLOGICAL SAMPLES AND REVIEW
General principles:
The RELEVANCE studyrequires ahisto logical review of all patients included in the trial at 
diagnosis. The aims of th e centralized histopathol ogystudywill be to confirm the diagnosis of 
follicular lymphoma , according to the criteria of the updated WHO classifica tion 2008 (S. 
Swerd low et al.) f or each included patient. Histological criteria of inclusi onandexclusi onhave 
been detailed in the protocol.
The review process will be co-ordinatedby andwill beperformed by  an internat ional 
board of expert pathol ogists including LYS Apatho logists as well as any willing pathologist 
coordinator. Expert pathologists will meet in LYS A-P, , on a regular 
basis depending on the number of samples received and analyzed.
Therefore for each randomize d patient, tumor ti ssue blocks and bone marrow biops y- or only when 
not possible -unstained slides will have to be sent for analysis and confirma tionof diagno sis to
LYSA-P, , France following the process described below. To 
optimize the number of sam ples reviewed, it isadvised to desi gnate a coordinator patho logist per
countr ywho will b e in charge of the sample request in his countr y.
Practical aspects of the LYSA-Preview:
1.Infor mation on patient randomiza tion
For France and Belgium, atpatient randomiza tion,theinves tigator will be requested to fax
oremail toLYSA-P a copy ofthe histopathological report where 
the name and address of the pathol ogist having di agnosed the lymph oma will beeasily identified 
as well as the bone marrow report when possible. However, in the case where no histopathologica l 
report is available, the name and address of the initialpathologist as well as the report number will 
have to be indicated on the CRF form . This procedure is set up to optimize tracing o f the samples.
For other countri es, the investigator will be requested to send a copy ofthehistopatho logical repor t
(as described above) to the designated pat hological coordinator.
2.Sample request
Atrecept ion of thepatho logicalreport and inclusi on form, theLYS A-P or the designated 
patho logical coordinator will contact the ini tialpathologist and send:
ThePathol ogyInitialDiagnos is form
Aletter requesting
theparaffin block from the f ormalinfixedsample that was used to set the diagnosis and/ 
or 10 unstained Superfrost+ slides
theparaffi nblock of the bone marrow biopsy (if available) or 5 unstained sections 
with the HES slide.

Confident ial and Propri etary 3 RV-FOL -GELARC -0683C Amend 2 Final: 08Feb20161. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Change the timing of CR/CRu at 120 weeks from N = 644 to all rando mized subjects. 
Com plete Response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks from rando mizat ion and PFS are the co -
primary  endpoints.  Both will be assessed by IRC according to IWG (Cheson, 1999) criteria .  In 
the current protocol, the analysis o f CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks will be based on the first 644 
subjects randomized.  It is important and logical to utilize full informat ion on all patients 
rando mized. This will also mean that at the time of analysis o f the coprimary  endpoint, all 
patients will  have com pleted treatm ent whi ch means that the study  integrity will not be 
compromised if the results are released. This also provides increased power for various proposed 
subgroup analyses with more subjects in e ach subgroup.  After consultation wit h the study  
scientific co mmittee, it was recommended to amend the study protocol to conduct the primary 
analysis of CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks based on all randomized subjects . 
This change is made in the fo llowing Sect ions:
Statistical Analysis Sample Size

Add an interim analysis for PFS
The co -primary endpo int PFS will be also analyzed as an interim analysis when the primary  
analysis of CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks based on all randomized subjects is performed . In order to 
control  the overall alpha for PFS, an alpha -spending funct ion of Gamma Family wit h parameter -
2.5 will be applied. It is estimated that around 27 0 PFS events (or 0.60 informat ion) woul d occur 
at the interim PFS analysis. A statist ically significant treatment effect on PFS will be reached if 
the two -sided p -value ≤ 0.016 at the interim PFS analysis, and ≤ 0.043 at the final PFS analysis. 
If the actu al number of PFS events greatly  deviates from  270 at the time of the interim PFS 
analysis, the interim alpha spending will be adjusted accordingly using the same alpha spending 
funct ion based on the actual number of PFS events and informat ion level.
This c hange is made in the fo llowing Sect ions:
Synopsis Interim analysis for efficacy
Secti on 14.7.2
Add CR at 120 weeks as the first secondary  endpo int.
CR rate as a component of CR/CRu is of part icular scient ific and clinical importance (for 
example, a recent ly completed meta -analysis indicate an improvement in CR rate at 30 months 
predi cts PFS very  well (Sargent, DJ, et.al., J Clin Onco l 33, 2015 (suppl; abstr 8504) ).  
Therefore, CR rate at 120 weeks is being upgraded as the first secondary  efficacy endpo int. This

Summary  of Changes RV-FOL-GELARC -0683C Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 3 RV-FOL-GELARC -0683C Amend 1 Final : 8 June 20121. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below :
1.The secondary  efficacy object ives in the protocol areupdated to allow adjustment for 
multiplicit y. The number of secondary efficacy endpoints is reduced to  three: EFS, 
TTNLT, and OS.  The other secondary object ives (TTF, TTNCT, ORR and healt h related 
qualit y of life quest ionnaire EORTC QLQ C30) are moved to the exploratory  endpo ints.  
Justification : The secondary  endpoints are revised i n accordance wi th  
regarding multiplicit y.In addit ion, TTF i s not an efficacy endpo ints clearly stated in the 
; TTNCT is very  similar to TTNLT and it will not add value but consume 
alpha; Similar ly,ORR is also moved to exploratory since CR rate is being assessed as co -
primary  endpoint .
2.The overall survival ( OS)will be calculated fro m the time o f rando mizat ion.
Justification :  the statist ical p lan was updated for 
calculat ion of OS f rom the time o f rando mizat ion.
3.Lenalido mide dose adaptati on rul es are am ended. In addit ion, dose adapti on for thyroid 
stimulat ing hormone (TSH) abnormalit y and guidance on m anagement of rash havebeen 
added .
Justification : To improve patient compliance with dosing and study visit schedule, mid-
cycle dose reducti ons are not allowed.  During a cycle, only dose interru ption and restart  
at the sam e dose level are all owed depending upon when the AE occurred and at the 
discreti on of  the treating physician. Based upon the two coordinat ing invest igators 
recommendat ion dose adaptation for TSH and guidance on management of ra sh have 
been added.
4.The PK substudy  is removed from the protocol .
Justification : The sparse PK is removed from the study for  the following reasons:
a. A preliminary  analysis wi th PK data from  multiple disease indications indicate that 
type of cancer does not affect PK of lenalido mide.
b.Drug -drug i nteracti ons between l enalido mide and rituximab is not anticipated, as they 
do not share the same clearance p athway. 
c.Sparse PK data without intensive PK data are difficult to analyze.
dThe drug exposure at one dose level o f lenalidomide plus high exposure variabilit y 
with the sparse PK is not wide enough for a meaningful exposure -response analysis in 
this study.
e.An integrated PK/PD report utilizing historical data in MM/MDS and newly  collected 
data in MCL/CLL is planned to be generated.  This report will show that PK of 
lenalido mide is not sensit ive to the ty pe of cancer, and thus it may  be used to support the 
future filling for FL.

Summary  of Changes RV-FOL-GELARC -0683C Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 4 RV-FOL-GELARC -0683C Amend 1 Final : 8 June 20125.Modified visit schedule to reduce the number of visits in Cycle 1 ;Day 2 and Day  4visits 
have been removed from fi rst cy cle of treatm ent, wi th a recommended monitoring for TLS 
during first week of cycle 1 and telephone contact added at Day  5of the first cy cle. 
Justification : Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is characterized by  metabolic abnorm alities 
that can occur during rapid tumor breakdown in response to anti -cancer treatment. TLS is 
commo n in pat ients with NHL or acute l eukem ia (Howard et al, 2011, NEJM 364: 1844), 
but it is unco mmo n amo ng the patients with fo llicular lympho ma unless the patient has 
high WBC counts or receives ant i-CD20 treatm ent.
Although rare, TLS has been reported in NHL patients treated with lenalido mide, either 
as monotherapy  or in combinat ion with rituximab. One case of grade 1 TLS was reported 
in the 309 relapsed/refractory  NHL pat ients receiving lenalidomide mo notherapy  in three 
Celgene sponsored phase 2 studies.  In a single -center, open -label Phase II investigator 
study , Duti a et al . (2009), evaluat ing the use of lenalido mide plus rituximab in patients 
with relapsed or refractory  indolent B-cell NHL, two of the first four patients (with no 
TLS prophylaxis) receiving lenalido mide dose of 25 mg developed tumor lysis.  After 
initiating TLS prophylaxis wit h allopurino l, no further TLS events were recorded in 12 
additional patients receiving 20 mg lenalidomide dose (Total N=16) (Dutia et al., 2009, 
ASH abstract #1679). 
TLS and tumor flare reaction (TFR) hav e comm only been observed in pat ients with CLL, 
who were treated with lenalido mide.  In some CLL patients, tumor flare and tumor lysis 
have been life -threatening and fatal.  Based on early  CLL resul ts from CC-5013- CLL-
001, frequent monitoring visits were in cluded during the first cy cle in protocol s 
evaluat ing lenalido mide in CLL and lympho ma patients, including the current study . 
Since then, more experience wit h lenalido mide in CLL populat ions has been gained with 
the current CLL -008 data that support the re duced mo nitoring visit frequency to ease the 
burden on subjects without compromising their safety . Cel gene reviewed safety  data from  
the first 55 subjects (26 received lenalidomide) enrolled into the CLL -008 study . No 
clinical TLS was reported. One case of laboratory  TLS was reported however it could not 
be confirmed according to the Cairo -Bishop definition and didn’t result in any dose 
modificati on. 
Results to date, demonstrate that with implementatio n of TLS prophylaxis, TLS risk 
(which was the basis for the very  frequent visits) could be mit igated.
In the current FL study , the pati ents randomized to the rituximab
-lenalido mide:
receive allopurino l prophylaxis and are strongly recommended to be well 
hydrated especially during the first week of lenalidomide administration.  
have 6 visits during the 28 day s of Cycle 1 on Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 22 with blood 
draws on Day s 1, 2, 4, 8, 15 
The am endment proposes to reduce the cy cle 1 m onitoring visi ts from 6 to 4 as follows: 
have 4 visits during the 28 day s of Cycle 1 on Day 1, Day  8, Day  15, Day  22 of  
Cycle 1 wi th blood draws on Day s 1, 8, 15

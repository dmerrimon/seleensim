TITLE:  An Open- Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of APX001 in 
Non-Neutropenic Patients w ith Candidemia,  with or w ithout Invasive Candidiasis, Inclusive of 
Patients with Suspected Resistance to Standard of Care Antifungal Treatment  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  APX001 -201 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  APX001  
PHASE:  2 
INDICATION:  Treatment of non -neutropenic patients with candidemia  – inclusive of those 
patients with suspected or confirmed antifungal -resistant candidemia  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective  of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of APX001 for the 
treatment of adult non -neutropenic patients  ≥18 years of age with candidemia that  may include 
patients with  suspected or confirmed resistan ce to standard of care (SOC) antifungal treatment.  
The secondar y objectives of this study are to:  
• Evaluate the time to first negative blood culture  
• Evaluate the percentage of patients with Mycological Outcomes at  End of Study Drug 
Treatment ( EOST), End of Antifungal Treatment (EOT),  and 2 and 4 weeks after EOT  
• Evaluate the percentage of patients with Treatment Success at EOT, and 2 and 4 weeks after 
EOT  
• Evaluate overall survival at Study Day 30 
• Evaluate safety parameters, including number of patients with treatment- emergent adverse 
events  (TEAEs)  
• Evaluate pharmacokinetic (P K) parameters of APX001  
BACKGROUND:  
Disseminated infections associated with Candida species  (spp.)  are a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality. Candidemia is a common cause of healthcare -associated blood stream 
infections with approximately 50% of isolates identified as non- Candida albicans  for which the 
Infectious Diseases Society of America  (IDSA) revised clinical practice guidance in 2016 . 
Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a clin ical alert for the ongoing 
transmission of C. auris  in healthcare facilities with most isolates identified in blood. Antifungal 
susceptibility testing revealed resistance to one or more classes of antifungals, including 
echinocandins, which have been first  line empiric therapy for candidemia pending definitive 
speciation .

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 3 APX001, a first -in-class small molecule drug candidate, is the water soluble phosphate prodrug of 
APX001A. APX001 is rapidly metabolized by circulating phosphatases in vivo to APX001A. 
APX 001A has a novel mechanism of action with broad spectrum activity versus major fungal 
pathogens including Candida spp. and Aspergillus  spp., including isolates with resistance to 
azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes.  APX001A targets the conserved fungal enz yme 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored wall transfer protein 1 (GWT1 ), which is required 
for the expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the fungal cell wall. Inhibition of GWT1 by 
APX001A compromises cell wall integrity, inhibits biofilm formation , blocks filamentation, 
enhances immunogenicity of unmasked β-glucan,  and produces severe fungal growth defects . The 
closest ma mmalian ortholog of GWT1 is PIG -W, which ha s no demonstrable  inhibition by 
APX001A.  
APX001A has demonstrated broad in vitro antifungal activity against Candida spp.,  including 
activity against azole -resistant and echinocandin -resistant strains. APX001A has demonstrated 
synergy with echinocandins ( Aspergillus ) and azoles ( Candida). In inva sive fungal disease animal 
models, including those for Aspergillus  spp. and Candida spp. that are resistant to azoles, 
APX001A has demonstrated high survival rates and reduced colony counts of fungi in the lungs 
of infected mice . The PK-pharmacodynamic (PD ) driver for efficacy of APX001A was associated 
with area under the concentration -time curve (AUC)/minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).  
In 2 completed Phase 1 clinical studies of APX001, the safety, tolerability, and PK  of single 
ascending doses and mul tiple ascending doses administered intravenously (IV) and orally (PO) to 
healthy volunteers were studied. A total of 166 healthy volunteers w ere enrolled in the 
placebo -controlled Phase 1 studies of APX001. All APX001 doses studied in Phase 1 were 
consider ed well tolerated. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were  reported, and most of the 
non-SAEs  were mild, transitory , and required no intervention. No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
were observed and no TEAEs or safety laboratory test results met any of the a prior i rules that 
prevented dose escalation to the next protocol -specified cohort. The maximum tolerated dose was 
not determined/reached in either of the Phase 1 studies. Pharmacokinetic parameters for maximum 
serum concentration and AUC in both single a nd multiple APX001 IV and PO doses we re linear 
and dose proportional. In both the in vitro studies and in a cohort embedded within the PO  dose 
Phase 1 study, APX001 demonstrated a favorable drug -drug interaction profile. APX001A was 
shown to be a weak inducer of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2B6; a moderate inducer of CYP1A2, 
CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4; and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. The relative 
bioavailability of the PO formulatio n was >90% in healthy subjects. There was no  evidence of an 
effect on the bioavailability of APX001 in the presence of food  (high fat and high calorie).  Most 
importantly, the target AUCs anticipated for efficacy against both yeast and molds have been 
achie ved with both IV and PO dose formulations  tested in Phase 1 . 
In summary, APX001 is a promising new antifungal agent with a novel mechanism of action 
having  broad spectrum activity against Candida spp., including activity against azole - and 
echinocandin -resistant Candida spp. Because APX001 is a first- in-class  drug candidate with a 
novel mechanism of action , no cross -resistance with other classes of antifungal drugs has been 
observed or is expected.

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 6 Dosing Criteria  
Patients  must meet the following criteria to begin dosing:  
1. Confirmed diagnosis of candidemia  
2. Received ≤2 days  (≤48 hours)  equivalent of prior systemic antifungal treatment at approved 
doses to treat the current episode of candidemia

≤5 days  (≤120 hours)  equivalent of prior treatment  for candidemia caused by Candida spp. 
with documented resistance to the specific prior antifungal administered  
STUDY DESIGN  AND DURATION:  
This is a multicenter, open -label, non -comparative, single -arm study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of APX001 for the first -line treatment for candidemia , including  suspected or confirmed 
antifungal -resistant candidemia in non -neutropenic patients  ≥18 years of age . Suspicion of 
antifungal -resistant candidemia is sufficient and subsequent documented resistance is not required  
for enrollment. The Study Drug Treatment Period will be up to a maximum of 14 days  (inclusive 
of the loading dose  [Study Day 1] ). After completion of 14 days study drug therapy, if further 
antifungal treatment is indicated  to complete treatment of candidemia in accordance with standard 
practice guidelines, fluconazole (unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal 
therapy) may commence  for up to a further 7 days. There will be a Follow -up Period of 4 weeks  
(+4 days)  after EOT. The total duration of participation in the study is up to approximately 
7.5 weeks (inclusive of the Screening Period [ ≤96 hours prior to Baseline ]).  
Patients  with a yeast identified in a blood culture  or a positive rapid diagnostic method are eligible 
to be consented and screened for the study. Patients  must have at least 1 positive blood test  for 
Candida  spp. (or yeast suspected to be Candida ) for a diagnosis of candidemia  to be considered 
for enrollm ent into the study. Patients with a positive blood culture showing yeast suspected to be 
Candida  must have identification of Candida spp. from positive blood culture confirmed prior to 
dosing. Screening and Baseline procedures and the start of APX001 study drug will be initiated  
within 96  hours from the time that the SOC blood sample for the Candida spp. positive culture or 
rapid diagnostic test was drawn.  
Patients  with >2 days  (>48 hours) equivalent of prior systemic antifungal treatment at approved 
doses to treat the current episode of candidemia within 96 hours before first dose will be excluded. 
However, patients  with Candida infections proven to be resistant to the specific  antifungal  
administered  may have  received ≤5 days  (≤120 hours) equivalent of that prior treatment (results 
of susceptibility testing are required pr ior to enrollment).  
All patients  (or the patient ’s LAR) will sign an ICF before any protocol specified procedures that 
are not indicated by SOC may be conducted. Inclusion/exclusion criteria assessments, medical 
history, demographics, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score will be 
collected before dosing.  
On Study Day 1 (or over the first 24 hours if started in the evening ), a 1000 mg APX001 loading 
dose will be administered over 3 hours by IV infusion twice daily (BID) . On Study Days 2 and 3 
of study drug, a 600 mg APX001 maintenance dose will be administered over 3 hours by IV 
infusion once daily ( QD). On Study Day 4 and onward, the APX001 maintenance dose will be

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 7 administered as either 600  mg APX001 IV infusion QD over 3 hours  or 700 mg PO QD. Patients  
who have completed a minimum of 3  days of IV APX001, are clinically stable as determined by 
the Investigator, able to swa llow tablets, and have no further growth of the infecting organism 
48 hours following the most recent blood culture, may switch from IV to PO dosing on Study 
Day 4 and onward. Study drug will be adminis tered for a maximum of 14 days . At the 
Investigator’s discretion , patients  requiring a longer duration of antifungal therapy will be 
switched to fluconazole (unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal therapy), to 
adhere to the IDSA c linical practice guideline s for the treatment of Candidiasis .  
Candida  spp. blo odstream infection will be monitored by daily blood culture during Study Drug 
Treatment until 2  consecutive blood cultures are negative, and at EOST, EOT, and 2 and 4 weeks 
after EOT, or Early Termination. Simultaneously drawn blood samples will be collect ed for 
Candida  testing by T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) assay at Baseline, during Study Drug 
Treatment, and EOST, or Early Termination. Other cultures, histopathology, and imaging tests to 
assess the site(s) and extent of  candidemia  infection  at other sites  will be conducted as clinically 
indicated, and the results should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form. The management 
of intravascular catheters , intravascular devices,  and, if applicable, any drains will be recorded, 
including any associated m icrobiology results.  
Patients  will be monitored for safety throughout the duration of the study. Safety assessments will 
include vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, 
and urinalysis), physical examinations  (including neurological assessment) , prior and concomitant 
medication reporting, and adverse event reporting. A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be 
performed at Baseline (pre -dose), EOST, EOT, and 4 weeks after EOT, or Early Termination . A 
dilated fund oscopic examination will be performed at Screening for all patients and at  EOST, 
EOT, and 4 weeks after EOT, or Early Termination  for those patients who had positive 
fundoscopic findings at Screening, or as clinically indicated . A urine pregnancy test (for  females 
of childbearing potential only) will be performed at Screening and Baseline (pre -dose), every 
30 days during treatment if required by local regulations, EOST, EOT, and 2  and 4 weeks after  
EOT, or Early Termination.  
Plasma samples for PK (APX001 [prodrug] and APX001A [active moiety]) will be collected at 
Baseline  (pre-dose) , twice  weekly during S tudy Drug Treatment , EOST, EOT , 2 weeks  after EOT , 
or Early Termination . Serum samples for (1,3) -β-D-glucan levels will be c ollected at Baseline 
(pre-dose)  and EOST,  or Early Termination  (if applicable).  
Optionally, if body fluids are sampled as par t of routine patient management  (e.g., bronchoalveolar 
lavage, lumbar puncture, paracentesis, vitreal fluid c ollection, abscess dra inage ), within 
approximately 2 hours of blood sampling for PK, these samples may be stored for future analysis 
of APX001  and APX001A  levels.  
The evaluation of treatment outcome will be assessed at EOST, EOT , and 2 and 4 weeks after 
EOT, or Early Terminatio n. 
The end of study will occur after the last visit of the last patient on the study.

Patients  who have completed a minimum of 3 days of APX001 IV administration may be eligible 
for PO switch  on Study Day 4 and onward. Patients must  meet all of the following criteria  to 
switch from  IV to PO  dosing of  APX001:  
• Is clinically stable,  as determined by the Investigator  
• Is able to swallow tablets  
• Is demonstrated to have no further growth  of the infecting organism for 48 hours following the 
most recent blood culture  
RATIONALE FOR DOSE AND SCHEDULE SELECTION:  
Dose  
In PK -PD studies, immunocompromised mice were infected with 1 of 3 spp. of Candida  
(C. albicans , C. glabrata, or C. auris ) and groups of animals were dosed with APX001 at different 
dose fractionations. The AUC/MIC ratio was determined to be the PK -PD variable that best 
correlated with antifungal efficacy as assessed by fungal burden (colony -forming units [CFUs]) 
in the kidne y. The probability of target attainment (PTA) was calculated separately for each 
Candida  spp. tested. The PTA calculation used the APX001A free drug AUC level at the stasis 
endpoint divided by the MIC required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC 90) of each 
of the Candida spp. tested. 
The AUC level was estimated from a population PK model derived primarily from the Phase 1 
PK data. The stasis endpoint was defined as the quantity of Candida spp. in CFUs just prior to 
APX001 administration compared to CFUs at the endpoint of assessment ( i.e., 24 hours for 
C. albicans ; 96 hours for C. glabrata  and C. auris ). The MIC data for the Candida strains tested 
were obtained from recent surveillance data.  
Using the AUC at the stasis endpoint, along with the MIC 90 from the surveillance data and the 
predicted exposure at the dose regimen to  be used in this study, the PTA  for the 3 Candida spp. 
tested was s hown to be approximately 100%. Further, sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
evaluate the PTA under diffe rent scenarios including increased variability of PK parameters and 
higher Candida spp. MIC 90 values. For both scenarios the PTA remained >90%. This is reassuring , 
as hospitalized patients with severe infections may exhibit a higher clearance of antifungal  drugs 
and/or a patient may be infected with a Candida spp. with a particularly high MIC above the 
MIC 90.  
In 2 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, APX001 IV and PO formulations were safe and well 
tolerated. The majority of the TEAEs were mild, transitory, and resolved without intervention. No 
DLTs  were observed. Specifically, in the first -in-human Phase 1 clini cal study, a loading dose of 
APX001 1000 mg IV 2 -hour infusion BID on Day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of APX001 
600 mg IV 1 -hour infusion QD on Days 2 through 7, was safe and well tolerated. This IV dose 
regimen is identical to the IV dose regimen th at will be used in this study. In the second Phase 1 
clinical study, a dose of APX001 1000 mg administered PO QD on Days 1 through 14 was safe 
and well tolerated. This PO-dose regimen is higher than the 700 mg PO  dose that will be used in 
this study.

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 10 Sched ule 
To ensure the safety and tolerability of APX001 dosing for 14 days, this study will use an APX001 
dose and infusion duration already studied in Phase 1 for 14 days of therapy inclusive of IV and 
PO investigational drug therapy. The loading dose 1000 mg IV BID over a 3 -hour infusion 
followed by 600  mg IV QD over a 3 -hour infusion will optimize patient safety and tolerability on 
study. At Study Day 4, provid ed a patient meets the protocol -defined criteria for a  PO switch, then 
the switch will occur to PO APX001 dose at 700 mg QD for no more than 14 days of combined 
IV and PO APX001 therapy.  
Step-Down T herapy  
The IDSA clinical practice guidelines for treatment of C andidiasis recommend that the total 
duration of therapy for candidemia is 14  days after documented clearance of Candida spp. from 
the bloodstream ( i.e., first consecutive negative blood culture) and resolution of symptoms 
attributable to candidemia. Hence, the duration of antifungal treatment required to treat patients 
with candide mia in this study will be driven by the time to  clearance of candidemia. In 
3 randomized controlled trials in candidemia and invasive C andidiasis , the median time to 
bloodstream infection clearance after receiving appropriate antifungal therapy was 2 to 3 days. 
Therefore, patients enrolled in this study may need a few additional days of fluconazole therapy 
(unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal therapy) for a total duration of 
antifungal treatment of approximately 16 to 17 days. Likew ise, any patients who have deep- seated 
sites of infect ions diagnosed after enrollment , while they can continue to receive APX001 study 
drug treatment per protocol, will require additional days of fluconazole therapy.  
If appropriate, additional antifungal d rug therapy with fluconazole (unless susceptibility results 
warrant alternative antifungal therapy) can be administered beyond 14 days of APX001. The 
recommended dose of fluconazole is 800 mg QD on the first day followed by 400 mg QD, for a 
maximum of 7 days.

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 13 INDEPENDENT DATA REVIEW COMMITTEE:  
To ensure standardization of interpretation regarding the validity of study patients , the medical 
management , and response to treatment in this open- label study, a panel of recognized experts in 
the field of fungal infectious diseases will constitute a DRC. The DRC serves to provide 
independent oversight to confirm eligibility for efficacy analysis, to confirm the diagnosis of 
candidemia at study entry, and to adjudicate efficacy outcome . The DRC assessments for each 
patient  will be recorded in the database and used in the primary efficacy analysis of the study . The 
DRC members will not be Principal Investigators in the study . Guidelines for the DRC are 
described in the DRC Charter.  
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD:  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprised of members with pertinent expertise 
will review the accumulating data from the study periodically as set forth in the DSMB Charter, 
or more frequent ly at the request of the DSMB. The DSMB will advise the Sponsor on the 
continuing safety of the study patient s and those yet to be recruited to the study, as well as the 
continuing validity and scientific merit of the study. At any time, the independent DSMB may 
temporarily suspend enrollment until any significant safety concerns are resolved or terminate the 
study to ensure patient  safety , if in the opinion of the DSMB , further dosing would pose  an 
inappropriate safety risk. Guidelines for what constitutes inappropriate safety risks are described 
in the DSMB C harter .

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 14 STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary population for efficacy analysis will be the MITT Population.  
The efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively. The percentage of patients  with 
Treatment Success  at EOST  will be summarized. The same summary will be repeated for the 
Per-Protocol Population.  
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, t he percentage o f patients  with Treatment Success at EOT, 
and 2 and 4  weeks after EOT will be summarized. Similarly, the percentage of patients  with 
Mycological Outcomes at EOST, EOT, and 2 and 4 weeks after EOT will be summarized.  A 
descriptive summary of overall surviva l at Study Day 30 and time to first negative blood culture 
will also be provided . 
Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety  Population. Safety data will be patient  to 
clinical review and summarized by appropriate descriptive stati stics. A DSMB will be assigned to 
monitor safety on an ongoing basis throughout the study.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma concentration data will be performed using validated software 
in order to derive the population mean (an d variance) values of specific PK parameters.  
Plasma concentrations will be summarized descriptively by treatment group and time point of 
collection. Summary statistics in the tabulation will include n, mean, standard deviation, CV%, 
median, minimum, and maximum. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using population 
PK analysis methods, which will be described in a separate data analysis plan. Results of the PK 
analysis will be reported separately.  
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
A sample size of approximately 20 patients  will be recruited in this open -label study.  No formal 
statistical assessment for sample size determination has been performed. This sample size is 
considered adequate to provide the necessary data t o evaluate the efficacy and safety of APX001 .

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 24 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Disseminated infections associated with Candida species  (spp.)  are a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality. Candidemia is a common cause of healthcare -associated blood stream 
infections with approximately 50% of isolates identified as non -C. albicans  for which the 
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)  revised clinical practice guidance in 2016 .1 
Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a clinical alert for the ongoing 
transmission of C . auris  in healthcare facilities with most isolates identified in blood. Antifungal 
susceptibi lity testing revealed resistance to one or more classes of antifungals, including 
echinocandins, which have been first line empiric therapy for candidemia pending definitive speciation .
1,2 
APX001, a first -in-class small molecule drug candidate, is the water soluble phosphate prodrug of 
APX001A. APX001 is rapidly metabolized by circulating phosphatases in vivo to APX001A. 
APX001A has a novel mechanism of action with broad spectrum activity ve rsus major fungal 
pathogens including Candida spp. and Aspergillus  spp., including isolates with resistance to 
azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes.3,4,5 APX001A targets the conserved fungal enzyme  
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored wall transfer protein 1  (GWT1 ), which is required 
for the expression of GPI -anchored proteins on the fungal cell wall. Inhibition of GWT1 by 
APX001A compromises cell wall integrity, inhibits biofilm formation,  blocks filamentation, 
enhances immunogenicity of unmasked β -glucan,  and produces severe fungal growth defects .6,7 
The closest mammalian ortholog of GWT1 is PIG -W, which ha s no demonstrable  inhibition by 
APX001A.  
APX001A has demonstrated broad in vitro ant ifungal activity against Candida spp.,  including 
activity against azole- resistant and echinocandin -resistant strains. APX001A has demonstrated 
synergy with echinocandins ( Aspergillus )8,9 and azoles ( Candida). In invasive fungal disease  
(IFD) animal model s, including those for Aspergillus  spp. and Candida spp. that are resistant to 
azoles, APX001A has demonstrated high survival rates and reduced colony counts of fungi in the lungs of infected mice .
8,9 The pharmacokinetic (PK) -pharmacodynamic (PD) driver for efficacy 
of APX001A was associated with area under the concentration -time curve (AUC)/minimal 
inhibitory concentration (MIC).  
In 2 completed Phase 1 clinical studies of APX001, the safety, tolerability, and PK of single 
ascending doses and multiple ascending doses administered intravenously (IV) and orally (PO) to healthy volunteers we re studie d. A total of 166 healthy volunteers w ere enrolled in the 
placebo -controlled Phase 1 studies of APX001. All APX001 doses studied in Phase 1 were 
considered well tolerated. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were  reported, and most of  the 
non-SAE s were mild , transitory , and required no intervention. No dose -limiting toxicities  (DLTs)  
were observed and no treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs)  or safety laboratory test results 
met any of the a prior i rules that prevented dose escalation to the next protocol -specified cohort. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not determined/reached in either of the Phase 1 studies. Pharmacokinetic parameters for maximum serum concentration  (C
max) and AUC in both single 
and multiple APX001 IV and PO doses we re linear and dose proportional. In both the in vitro 
studies and in a cohort embedded within the PO dose Phase 1 study, APX001 demonstrated a 
favorable drug- drug interaction (DDI)  profile. APX001A was shown to be a weak inducer of 
cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2B6; a moderate inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4; and a 
weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. The relative bioavailability of the PO  formulation is 
>90% in healthy subjects. There was no evidence of an effect on the bioavailability of APX001 in

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 25 the presence of food (high fat and high calorie) . Most importantly, the target AUCs anticipated for 
efficacy against both yeast and molds have been achieved with both IV and PO dose formulations  
tested in Phase 1 . 
In summa ry, APX001 is a promising new antifungal agent with a novel mechanism of action 
having broad spectrum activity against Candida spp., including activity against azole - and 
echinocandin- resistant Candida spp. Because APX001 is first -in-class drug candidate with a novel 
mechanism of action , no cross -resistance with other classes of antifungal drugs has been observed 
or is expected. 
1.1 Rationale  
The need for improved treatment of IFDs remains high, particularly with the growing number of 
immunocom promised patients , such as hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant 
recipients, who are at particular risk for developing these infections and in whom treatment can be 
complex. Species of Candida and Aspergillus  are well recognized as the 2  major causes of fungal 
diseases in these  patients , although other emerging fungi, such as non- C. albicans  (e.g., 
C. glabrata  and C. auris ), Fusarium  spp., Scedosporium  spp., and Mucorales fungi, are 
contributing to the need to find new and better strategies for  managing these infections. Existing 
antifungal agents can be difficult to use, are often poorly tolerated, or have become increasingly ineffective due to the rise of drug resistant fungal strains . 
1.2 Risk/Benefit  
The safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple  doses of APX001 administered by IV 
infusion and PO in healthy volunteers were  studied in 2  Phase 1 studies , APX001 -101 and 
APX001 -102. 
Study APX001- 101 was a first -in-human  (FIH) Phase 1, randomized, placebo- controlled study to 
investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple doses of APX001 administered by IV infusion in healthy subjects. A final Clinical Study Report has been issued for this study . 
No severe o r SAEs have been reported and most of the adverse events were mild, transitory, and 
resolved with no intervention. There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in laboratory safety tests. The AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC
inf) and C max were linear and dose 
proportional.  
All doses of APX001 were safe and well tolerated , and the majority of TEAEs  were  mild, 
transitory, and resolved without intervention. Single IV doses of APX001 up to 350 mg over a 
3-hour infusion and single IV doses of 1000 mg over 0.5- , 1-, 2-, and 3- hour infusion s were well 
tolerated . Shorter infusion periods ( i.e., 1000 mg over 0.5 to 2 hours) appeared to have s imilar 
toleration compared to 3 -hour infusion periods. Multiple IV doses of APX001 up to 600 mg once 
daily  (QD), for 14 consecutive days , were well tolerated by the majority of subjects; however, the 
total number of TEAEs related to g astrointestinal (GI) and nervous system disorders increased 
when the dose was increased from 300 mg to 600 mg. A loading dose of 1000 mg a dministered

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 26 A final Clinical Study Report has been issued for this study. No severe or SAEs were reported and 
most of  the adverse events were mild, transitory, and resolved with no intervention. There were no 
clinically relevant changes from baseline in laboratory safety tests. The AUC inf and C max were 
linear and dose proportional. There was no impact of food on the PK of APX001A exposures 
(single dose of 400 mg). In cohort 3 (1000 mg, QD for 14 days), there was an increase in the 
number of subjects reporting adverse events; however, the intensity of reported events did not 
increase with multiple doses.  
All doses of APX0 01 were safe and well tolerated , and the majority of TEAEs were mild, 
transitory, and resolved without intervention. The single IV doses of 200 mg APX001 and single 
PO doses in the dose range of 100 mg to 500 mg were well tolerated. Multiple PO doses of 500 mg 
and 1000 mg of APX001 administered QD for 14 consecutive days were well tolerated by the 
majority of subjects; however, the number of moderate TEAEs, primarily those related to GI 
disorders, increased when the PO dose of APX001 increased from 500 mg t o 1000 mg. Dosing 
under fed conditions improved tolerability by decreasing TEAEs related to GI (nausea, vomiting) 
and nervous system disorders (headache, fatigue).  
There were no deaths or SAEs reported during the study nor were there any withdrawals due t o 
adverse events. There were no clinically significant findings with respect to laboratory  safety tests, 
vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, or weight. No DLTs were observed. 
No TEAEs or laboratory safety tests met any of the criter ia to prevent dose escalation. The MTD 
was not reached in this study.  
Patients  participating in this study will receive a drug in clinical development without regulatory 
approval for treatment of fungal diseases. Administration of APX001 in a concentratio n of 
1000 mg IV BID will be administered on Day 1, 600 mg IV QD w ill be administered on Days 2 
through 3, and then subsequently 600 mg IV or 700 mg PO  will be administered throughout the 
Study Drug T reatment Period . This treatment may have advantages over standard of care (SOC)  
therapy against certain resistant fungal diseases, where SOC treatment might show no or limited 
therapeutic effectiveness. Since the efficacy of APX001 has not yet been proven in patients , no 
additional protection of APX001 in this c oncentration can be assured. Patients  participating in this 
clinical study  will receive more intense health  monitoring as detailed in the schedule of procedures .

3.1 Summary of Study Design 
This is a multicenter, open -label, non -comparative, single -arm study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of APX001 for the first- line treatment for candidemia including suspected or confirmed 
antifungal -resistant candidemia in non -neutropenic patients  ≥18 years of age . Suspicion of 
antifungal -resistant candidemia is sufficient and subsequent documented resistance is not required  
for enrollment . The Study Drug Treatment Perio d will be up to a maximum of 14  days (inclusive 
of the loading dose [Study Day 1]). After completion of 14 days study drug therapy, if further 
antifungal treatment is indicated  to complete treatment of candidemia in accordance with standard 
practice guidelines, fluconazole (unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal therapy) may commence  for up to a further 7 days. There will be a Follow -up Period of 4 weeks  
(+4 days)  after EOT. The total duration of participation in the study is up to approximately 
7.5 weeks (inclusive of the Screening Period [ ≤96 hours prior to Baseline ]). 
This study will be conducted at approximately 20  sites in the United States and globally.  
A complete schedule of procedures for the study is found in Appendix A .

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 29 Patients  with a yeast identified in a blood culture  or a positive rapid diagnostic method  are eligible 
to be consented and screened for the study. Patients must have at least 1 positive blood test  for 
Candida spp. (or yeast suspected to be Candida) for a diagnosis of candidemia  to be considered  
for enrollment into the study. Patients  with a positive blood culture showing yeast suspected to be 
Candida must have identification of Candida spp. from positive blood culture confirmed prior to 
dosing. Screening and Baseline procedures and the start of APX001 study drug will be initiated  
within 96 hours from the time that the SOC blood sample for the Candida spp. positive culture or 
rapid diagnostic test was drawn.  
Patients with > 2 days ( >48 hours) equivalent of prior systemic antifungal treatment at app roved 
doses to treat the current episode of candidemia within 96 hours before first dose will be excluded. However, patients with Candida infections proven to be resistant to the s pecific antifungal 
administered  may have received ≤ 5 days (≤120 hours) equivalent of that prior treatment (results 
of susceptibility testing are required prior to enrollment).  
All patients  (or the patient’s  legal authorized representative [LAR]) will sign an Informed Consent 
Form  (ICF)  before any protocol specified procedures  that are not indicated by SOC may be 
conducted. Inclusion/exclusion criteria assessments, medical history, demographics, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II score will be collected before dosing.  
On Study Day 1 (or over the firs t 24 hours if started in the evening), a 1000 mg APX001 loading 
dose will be administered over 3 hours by IV infusion BID. On Study Days 2 and 3 of study drug, a 600 mg APX001 maintenance dose will be administered over 3 hours by IV infusion QD. On Study D ay 4 and onward, the APX001 maintenance dose will be administered as either 600 mg 
APX001 IV infusion  QD over 3 hours  or 700 mg PO QD. Patients who have completed a minimum 
of 3 days of IV APX001, are clinically stable as determined by the Investigator, ab le to swallow 
tablets, and have no further growth of the infecting organism 48 hours following the most recent 
blood culture, may switch from IV to PO dosing on Study Day 4 and onward. Study drug will be administered for a maximum of 14 days. At the Invest igator’s discretion , patients  requiring a 
longer duration of antifungal therapy will be switched to fluconazole (unless susceptibility results 
warrant alternative antifungal therapy), to adhere to the IDSA clinical  practice guideline s for the 
treatment of Candidiasis .

Candida spp. bloodstream infection will be monitored by daily blood culture during Study Drug 
Treatment until 2 consecutive blood cultures  are negative, and at EOST, EOT, and 2 and 4 weeks 
after EOT, or Early Termination. Simultaneously drawn blood samples will b e collected for 
Candida testing by T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) assay at Baseline, during Study Drug 
Treatment, and EOST, or Early Termination. Other cultures, histopathology, and imaging tests to 
assess the site(s) and extent of candidemia infection at ot her sites will be conducted as clinically 
indicated, and the results should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). The management of intravascular catheters, intravascular devices, and, if applicable, any drains will be recorded, including any associated microbiology results . 
Patients will be monitored for safety throughout the duration of the study. Safety assessments will include vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), physical examinations (including neurological assessment), prior and concomitant 
medication reporting, and adverse event reporting. A 12- lead ECG  will be performed at Baseline 
(pre-dose), EOST, EOT, and 4 weeks after EOT, or Early Termination. A dilated fundoscopic 
examination will be performed at Screening for all patients and EOST , EOT, and 4 weeks after

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 34 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment G roups  
All patients  will be administered a 1000 mg APX001 loading dose BID followed by a 600 mg 
APX001 maintenance dose QD on  Study Day 2 and Study Day 3. From  Study Day 4 onwards , the 
APX001 maintenance dose will be administered as either 600  mg APX001 IV infusion over 
3 hours QD or may be switched to 700 mg PO QD  when/if the criteria for PO  dosing are met 
(Section 5.5.3) . 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
5.2.1 Dose 
In PK -PD studies, immunocompromised mice were infected with 1 of 3 spp. of Candida 
(C. albicans , C. glabrata , or C. auris ) and groups of animals were dosed with APX001 at different 
dose fractionations. The AUC/MIC ratio was determined to be the PK -PD variable that best 
correlated with antifungal efficacy as assessed by fungal burden (colony- forming units [CFUs]) in 
the kidney. The probability of target attainment (PTA) was c alculat ed separately for each 
Candida spp. tested. The PTA calculation used the APX001A free drug AUC level at the stasis 
endpoint divided by the MIC required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC 90) of each 
of the Candida spp. tested. 
The AUC level was estimated from a population PK model derived primarily from the Phase 1 PK 
data.  
In 2 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, APX001 IV and PO formulations were safe and well 
tolerated. The majority of the TEAEs were mild, transitory, a nd resolved without intervention. No 
DLTs  were observed. Specifically, in the FIH  Phase 1 clinical study, a loading dose of APX001 
1000 mg IV 2- hour infusion BID on Day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of APX001 600 mg 
IV 1-hour infusion QD on Days 2 through 7, was safe and well tolerated. This IV dose regimen is 
identical to the IV dose regimen that will be used in this study. In the second Phase 1 clinical study, a dose of APX001 1000 mg administered PO  QD on Days 1 through 14 was safe and well tolerated. 
This PO -dose regimen is higher than the 700 mg PO dose that will be used in this study . 
5.2.2 Schedule  
To ensure the safety and tolerability of APX001 dosing for 14 days, this study will use an APX001 
dose and infusion duration already studied in Phase 1 for 14 days of therapy inclusive of IV and 
PO investigational drug therapy. The loading dose 1000 mg IV BID over a 3 -hour infusion 
followed by 600 mg IV QD over a 3 -hour infusion will optimize patient safety and tolerability on 
study. At Study Day 4, provided  a patient meets the protocol -defined criteria for a  PO switch, then 
the switch will occur to PO  APX001 dose at 700 mg QD for no more than 14 days of combined 
IV and PO  APX001 therapy.  
5.2.3 Step-Down T herapy  
The IDSA clinical practice guidelines for treatment o f Candidiasis recommend that the total 
duration of therapy for candidemia is 14 days after documented clearance of Candida spp. from 
the bloodstream ( i.e., first consecutive negative blood culture) and resolution of symptoms 
attributable to candidemia. Hence, the duration of antifungal treatment required to treat patients 
Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol APX001 -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 35 with candidemia in this study will be driven by the time to clearance of candidemia. In  
3 randomized controlled trials in candidemia and invasive Candidiasis , the median time to 
bloodstream infection clearance after receiving appropriate antifungal therapy was 2 to 3 days. 
Therefore, patients enrolled in this study may need a few additional days of fluconazole therapy (unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal therapy) for a total duration of antifungal treatment of approximately 16 to 17 days. Likewise, any patients who have deep- seated 
sites of infections diagnosed after enrollment, while they can continue to receive APX001 study drug treatment per protocol, will require additional days of fluconazole therapy.  
If appropriate, additional antifungal drug therapy with fluconazole (unless susceptibility results warrant alterna tive antifungal therapy) can be administered beyond 14 days of APX001. The 
recommended dose of fluconazole is 800 mg QD on the first day followed by 400 mg QD, for a 
maximum of 7 days.  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
This is a non -randomized, open- label study .

associate (CRA) . 
Any unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor  or destroyed on site per local standard 
operating procedure after monitoring has occurred. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures  
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures  
5.6.1.1 APX001A as a victim substrate for cytochrome P450 drug- drug interact ions 
APX001A is metabolized by multiple CYP enzymes and thus any single CYP enzyme that is 
inhibited or induced is unlikely to result in clinically significant changes in the levels of APX001A. 
Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol APX001 -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 37 However, patients who are receiving or will receive strong inducers of multiple CYP enzymes 
(e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifabutin, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenobarbital, 
modafinil, nafcillin, St. John's Wort, and enzalutamide ) are excluded from participating in the 
study.  
5.6.1.2 APX001A as a perpetrator of cytochrome P450 drug -drug interactions  
APX001A was shown to be a weak inducer of CYP2B6; a moderate inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4; and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. The potential clinical 
significance of any APX001A DDI  will depend on the extent of induction or inhibition and 
therapeutic margin of the specific victim substrate or substrates.  
Considering the magnitude of CYP inhibition/induction effects of APX001A , a review of drugs 
commonly used as part of the SOC for patients with candidemia indicates that clinically significant 
DDIs are unlikely to occur. Nonetheless, co -administration of drugs that are metabolized by the 
CYP enzymes in this study should be appr oached with caution and the need for increased 
frequency of drug monitoring (where applicable) considered, especially for CYP substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.  
5.6.2 Prohibited Medications and/or Procedures  
Eligible patients  are prohibited from receiving >2 days ( >48 hours)  equivalent of antifungal 
treatment in the 96 hours prio r to starting study treatment. The exception to this rule applies only 
to patients  whose candidemia is caused by Candida spp. with laboratory -confirmed resistance to  
the specific antifungal administered , for whom ≤5 days (≤120 hours)  equivalent of prior antifungal 
treatment is permitted. Once on study, patients  may not re ceive concomitant systemic anti fungal 
therapy for the treatment of candidemia  while they are receiving A PX001 .  
Patients  cannot have received  any investigational drug within 30 days prior to dosing.  
5.6.3 Step-down Antifungal Therapy  
The IDSA clinical practice guidelines for treatment of C andidiasis recommend that the total 
duration of therapy for candidemia is 14 days after documented clearance of Candida spp. from 
the bloodstream ( i.e., first consecutive negative blood culture) and resolution of symptoms 
attributable to candidemia. Hence, the durati on of antifungal treatment required to treat patients 
with candidemia in this study will be driven by the time to clearance of candidemia. In 
3 randomized controlled trials in candidemia and invasive C andidiasis , the median time to 
bloodstream infection cl earance after receiving appropriate antifungal therapy was 2 to 3 days. 
Therefore, patients enrolled in this study may need a few additional days of fluconazole therapy 
for a total duration of antifungal treatment of approximately 16 to 17 days. Likew ise, any patients 
who have deep- seated sites of infections diagnosed after enrollment, while they can continue to 
receive APX001 study drug treatment per protocol, will require additional days of fluconazole therapy.  
If appropriate, additional antifungal drug t herapy with fluconazole (unless susceptibility results 
warrant alternative antifungal therapy) can be administered beyond 14 days of APX001. The recommended dose of fluconazole is 800 mg QD on the first day followed by 400 mg QD, for a 
maximum of 7 days.

6.1 Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained f rom all patients  (or the patient’s LAR) prior to any 
study- specific procedures being performed. Patients with a  positive blood culture taken as SOC 
with yeast suspected to be Candida spp. or a positive rapid diagnostic method may sign the ICF 
and undergo S creening procedures, but must have a confirmed Candida spp. blood culture to be 
dosed. Only those patients who have transient loss of capacity (e.g., septic shock, mechanical 
ventilation, sedation) can  have a LAR sign consent. These patients, upon return of their capacity, 
will then be consented and allowed to make their own informed medical decisions. Patients wi th 
permanent loss of capacity will  not be eligible for study participation . 
6.2 Eligibility ( ≤96 Hours Prior to  Baseline)  
The following blood cultures drawn as SOC , prior to informed consent, will determine study 
eligibility : 
• Collect b lood culture and confirm positive for Candida spp.  
• Collect b lood sample for rapid diagnostic test positive for candidemia (if a rapid diagnostic 
test is availabl e and used routinely for diagnosis of candidemia; the test must be 
Sponsor -approved and subsequent confirmatory bl ood culture is also required)  
Screening is triggered by the early identification of Candida spp. (or yeast) in blood drawn as SOC  
within a 96 -hour window prior to first dose. I solates of Candida spp. from t he SOC culture must 
be submitted to the mycology reference laboratory for confirmation of identification and 
susceptibility testing.

7.5 Microbiological Assessments  
7.5.1 Blood Cultures  
A blood culture pos itive for Candida spp. drawn within 96 hours of APX001 dosing is required 
for eligibility as part of SOC. During screening, 2 consecutive  sets (1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic 
blood culture bottle per set) of blood cultures from 2 separate sites  (1 from a CVC an d 1 peripheral  
venipuncture , or 2 peripheral  venipunctures,  if a CVC is not applicable ) are required before the 
initiation of APX001 dosing. The screening cultures may be drawn on the day of dosing. Blood 
cultures (minimum of 1 set) for Candida spp. will also be performed at Baseline (pre -dose), during 
Study Drug Treatment, at EOST, EOT, and 2 and 4 weeks after EOT, or Early Termination. During the Study Drug Treatment Period, daily blood cultures are required on Study Days  1 through 4; 
thereafte r, blood 
cultures  may be stopped after negative results on 2 consecutive days are obtained. 
Candida spp. isolates from the blood cultures performed at the local laboratory must be submitted 
to the mycology reference laboratory for confirmation of identific ation and susceptibility testing.  
If a Sponsor -approved rapid diagnostic test for candidemia is used to identify potentially eligible 
patients, subsequent confirmatory blood cultures  are required prior to dosing. Likewise,  
Candida spp. isolates from these blood cultures are to be submitted to the mycology reference 
laboratory. Results from any further rapid diagnostic tests performed as per local SOC must be captured in the eCRF.

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 49 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavora ble and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a  study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. All adverse events, including observed 
or volunteered problems, complai nts, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the time of informed consent until study participation is complete. Patients should be ins tructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator. Beginning 
with Day 1 of study drug, Investigators should make an assessment for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific  disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at S creening should not be reported as an adverse event 
unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at Baseline change in severity or seriousness at any time duri ng the study. In this case, it should be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at S creening and significantly worsen during the s tudy 
should be reported as adverse events. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse eve nt. A laboratory finding that is abnormal but not clinically significant 
(e.g., does not warrant intervention) is not considered an adverse event.  
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a study drug related to any dose should be co nsidered an 
adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a study drug means that a causal relationship between a 
study drug and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be 
ruled out . 
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information. For APX001, the reference safety information is included in the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) currently in force. The reference safety 
Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol APX001 -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 50 information will be reviewed yearly and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized with the 
reporting period of the Development Safety Update Report . 
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
The Investigat or will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event and will also categorize 
each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of “ yes” or 
“no.” 
Assessment of Severity : 
The severity of all adverse events should be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Eve nts (CTCAE) v4.03. These criteria can be found at 
http://ctep. cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. For those adverse events not listed in the CTCAE, the 
following grading system should be used:  
• Mild (CTCAE Grade 1):  Transient symptoms, awareness of sign/symptom, but easily tolerated and no interference with patient ’s daily activities  
• Moderate (CTCAE Grade 2):  Marked signs/symptoms that interfere with patient ’s usual 
activities, but still acceptable  
• Severe (CTCAE Grade 3):  Incapacitating signs/symptoms which cause considerable 
interference with the patient ’s daily activities, unaccept able 
• Life-threatening (CTCAE Grade 4):  Life -threate ning or disabling adverse event  
• Death (CTCAE Grade 5):   Death -related adverse event  
The severity of infusion site reactions adverse events will be graded using the definitions in  
Table 1. 
Table  1. Infusion Site Reaction Adverse Event Severity Grading Table 
Event  Grade 1  
(Mild)  Grade 2  
(Moderate)  Grade 3  
(Severe)  Grade 4  
(Life -Threatening)  
Infusion/injection 
site reaction  Tenderness with or 
without associated 
symptoms ( e.g., 
warmth, erythema, 
itching)  Pain; lipodystrophy; 
edema; phlebitis  Ulceration or 
necrosis; severe 
tissue damage; 
operative 
intervention 
indicated  Life-threatening 
consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated  
Infusion/injection site reaction is defined as a disorder characterized by an intense adverse reaction (usually immunologic) 
developing at the site of an infusion/injection.  
Causality Assessmen t: 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence  or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be identified.

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 51 The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any oth er disease the patient may have  
• Concomitant drug-  
o The other drugs the patient  is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in 
questi on 
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug-  
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response  is likely to be a 
class effect  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event  
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug-  
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered 
8.2 Serio us Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
o An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form , might have caused 
death  
• Requires hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations  
o Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as an SAE  under this crite rion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or 
planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as

situational reasons ( i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will 
not be conside red inpatient hospitalizations  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• An important medical event  
o Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizations, or t he 
development of drug dependency  
8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators  
Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until 30 days following the last 
administration of study drug must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety  within 24 hours of the 
knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any adverse event that meets any of the aforementioned 
serious criteria). All SAEs  that the Investigator  considers related to study drug occurring afte r the 
30-day F ollow -up Period  must be reported to the Sponsor. 
To report the SAE, the Investigator must complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system for the study. When the form is completed, Medpace Clinical Safety  
personnel will be notified  electronically and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious ness 
criteria and it is not possible to access  the EDC system , the Investigator should send an e- mail to 
Medpace Clinical Safety  at Medpace- safetynotification@medpace.com  or call the Med pace 
Clinical Safety  SAE reporting line  (phone number listed below), and fax the completed paper SAE

a. To be completed within 96 hours from blood sampling time for culture positive for Candida spp. 
b. During Study Drug Treatment, twice weekly visits are required with a maximum  window of ±2 days . Outp atients  will be asked to record daily dosing on a diary and bring the 
diary and study drug bottles with them to every clinic visit.  
c. End of Study Drug Treatment  (EOST)  occurs after completion of APX001 dosing.  
d. Assessments performed at EOST do not need to be repeat ed at End of Antifungal  Treatment ( EOT ), if <48 hours apart, unless clinically indicated.  
e. The EOST  may be the same as EOT  for those patients that do not have a step-down (i.e.,  fluconazole or other protocol approved step-down).  
f. The EOT occurs up to a maxim um of 21 days after Baseline (includes  up to 14 days of APX001 administration and up to 7 days of fluconazole administration  or other 
protocol approved step-down).  
g. To be obtained prior to the initiation of any protocol -specific procedure outside of SOC . 
h. Vital signs will include temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and weight . Vital signs will be collected  at Screening, Baseline (pre-dose),  
daily on Study Days 2 to 4, and twice  weekly thereafter during Study Drug Treatment, EOST, EOT , and 2 and 4  weeks  after EOT , or Early Termination . Height will be 
collected (from the patient’s medical record) at Baseline.  
i. If possible, all indwelling intravascular catheters should be removed and the c atheter tips cultured prior to  starting APX001 dosing. The entrance site should also be cultured if 
it appears infected.  Any removed catheter tip should be sent for culture.  
j. Intravascular catheters logged until EOT .

Version 3.0, 03 June 2019 68 k. As clinically indicated. If obtained, results should be recorded in the eCRF.  
l. Only required in those patients  who had positive fundoscopic findings at Screening , or as clinically indicated.  
m. Screening laboratory assessments  to determine eligibility  will be performed at the local laboratory and may have been coll ected as SOC  within the previous 24 hours. 
Laboratory assessments collected after Screening  will be sent to the central laboratory for analysis . Clinical safety l aboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation, and urinalysis) will be collected at Baseline  (pre-dose), twice weekly during Study Drug Treatment , at EOST, EOT , and 2  and 4  weeks  after EOT , or Early 
Termination.  If clinically indicated and at the discretion of the Investigator, or if a suspected adverse event  is iden tified, clinical laboratory assessments may be conducted at 
any time during the study and compared to Baseline . 
n. Urine pregnancy test  (for females of childbearing potential only)  every 30 days if  required by local regulations.  
o. A complete physical examination will be conducted at Baseline (pre -dose). Complete physical examination will include an assessment of general appearance, skin, eyes, 
heart, chest, abdomen, the body site that corresponds to the entry site of candidemia ( e.g., central venous catheter ent ry site) , if applicable , and a neurological examination. 
Components of the neurological examination include cranial nerve, sensory and motor examination, reflex and gait testing, and coordination assessment . A focused, 
symptom -based physical examination to include a neurological examination  will be performed  once weekly during study drug treatment , EOST, EOT, and 2 and 4  weeks after 
EOT , or Early Termina tion. 
p. Each time a blood culture is collected, an additional blood sample will be drawn for subsequent analysis of the c orrelation of blood culture and T2MR assay Candida  spp. 
results from Baseline (pre -dose) through EOST or Early Termination. A central laboratory will perform the T2MR assay.  
q. Two consecutive sets of blood cultures  during screening within 96 hours before the initiation of APX001 study treatment; 1 set thereafter.  
r. All Candida spp. i solates must  be submitted to the mycology reference laboratory for confirmation of identification and susceptibility testing.  
s. During Study Drug Treatment, daily blood cultures on Study Days 1 through 4 (minimum), continuing until 2 consecutive blood cultures negative for Candida spp. are 
reported.  
t. Optional  rapid diagnostic test , if available and used routinely for candidemia diagnosis; test  (e.g.,  T2MR  assay ) must be Sponsor-approved; a subsequent confirmatory blood 
culture must also be performed to confirm Candida spp. 
u. Plasma samples for PK  (APX001 [prodrug] and APX001A [active moiety]) will be collected at Baseline  (pre-dose) , twice  weekly during S tudy Drug Treatment, EOST, EOT , 
2 weeks  after EOT , or Early Termination . Optional: If body fluids are sampled as part of routine patient management ( e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage, lumbar puncture, 
paracentesis, vitreal fluid co llection, abscess drainage ), within approximately 2 hours of blood sampling for PK, these samples may be stored for future analysis of APX001 
and APX001A  levels.   
v. Other cultures, histopathology, and imaging tests to assess  the site(s) and extent of  candidemia infection, if applicable. If performed, these will be analyzed at the local study 
site. 
w. Serum samples for  (1,3)-β -D-glucan levels will be collected at Baseline ( pre-dose ) and EOST, or Early Termination  (if applicable) . 
x. Study drug will be administered as an IV  loading dose over 3 hours BID on Study Day 1  (or over the first 24 hours if started  in the evening); on Study Days 2 and 3 study 
drug will be administered over 3 hours by IV QD; on Study Day 4  and onward , PO administration of the study drug may be considered if the patient meets the IV to PO 
switch  criteria.  Study drug will be administered for a maximum of 14 days (inclusive of the loading dose [Study Day 1]) . 
y. After completion of 14 days study drug therapy, if further antifungal treatment is indicated  to complete treatment of candidemia in accordance with standard practice 
guidelines, fluconazole (unless susceptibility results warrant alternative antifungal therapy) may commence for up to a fu rther 7 days.

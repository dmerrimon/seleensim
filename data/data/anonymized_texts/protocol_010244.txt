 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
Androgen deficiency is common and associated with bothersome symptoms of sexual dysfunction, physical 
dysfunction, and fatigue in men with organ -localized prostate cancer who have undergone radical 
prostatectomy and have undetectable PSA levels for 2 or mo re years after their surgery. LY2452473 (LY 
SARM), a highly selective SARM, is particularly attractive for the treatment of symptoms of androgen 
deficiency in these patients because it displays agonist activities on sexual function and muscle but 
antagonis t activity in the prostate in preclinical models and in human trials of up to 6 months duration. Our 
overall objective  is to conduct a double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, randomized dose ranging 
trial to determine the efficacy  and safety of a SARM in improving the symptoms of androgen deficiency 
(sexual symptoms, fatigue/low vitality, and physical dysfunction) in men with prostate cancer who have 
undergone radical prostatectomy for organ -localized prostate cancer (pT2,N0,M0), Gleason score < 7 (3+4) 
, who have undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/mL using a sensitive PSA assay) for > 2 years after radical 
prostatectomy, and who have androgen deficiency. In addition to demonstrating its safety, our first aim is to 
compare  0, 1 ,5 or 15 mg of LY SARM in men , who have undergone radical prostatectomy for organ -
localized prostate cancer, have symptomatic androgen deficiency and very low risk of disease recurrence, 
with regard to sexual function (sexual activity score, sexual desire, erectile function, distress and sexual life 
quality). The second aim  is to compare the effects of 0, 1 , 5 or 15 mg of SARM on fatigue, well -being and 
affectivity balance, and disease -specific quality of life. Our third aim  is to determine whether SARM 
administration improves muscle m ass and strength, and self -reported and performance -based measures of 
physical function, and aerobic capacity (VO 2max , VO 2 peak, and lactate threshold)more than placebo.   
 
1.1 Study Design  
 
This will be a staged phase IIA  randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group, double blind  trial in men, 19 
years of age or older, who have undergone radical prostatectomy for organ -localized prostate cancer, have 
low testosterone levels and associated symptoms, and are deemed to be a t low risk of recurrence. At the end,  
114 subjects will have been randomized to placebo  (n=36), 1 mg (n= 28), 5 mg (n=36), and 15 mg  (n=14) 
doses.  A target sample size of 114participants from three  trial sites will have 90% power to test the primary 
hypot hesis.  
 
1.2 Primary Objectives  
 
Our overall objective  is to conduct a double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, randomized dose 
ranging trial to determine the efficacy  and safety of a SARM in improving the symptoms of androgen 
deficiency (sexual symptoms, fatigue/low vitality, and physical dysfunctio n) in men with prostate cancer 
who have undergone radical prostatectomy for organ -localized prostate cancer (pT2,N0,M0), Gleason score 
<7 (3+4) who have undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/mL using a sensitive PSA assay) for > 2 years after radical 
prostatectomy, an d who have androgen deficiency. In addition to demonstrating its safety, our first aim is to 
compare  0, 1, 5 or 15 mg of LY SARM in men, who have undergone radical prostatectomy for organ -
localized prostate cancer, have symptomatic androgen deficiency and  very low risk of disease recurrence, 
with regard to sexual function (sexual activity score, sexual desire, erectile function, distress and sexual life 
quality).  
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease (s) 
 
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in American men, accounting for 29% of all diagnosed 
cancers and approximately 13% of all cancer deaths; its incidence is on the rise, partly due to increased 
screening with PSA52. In 2010, approximately 217,730 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed in the 
United States, and there were 32,050 deaths related to prostate cancer53. The majority of these men have 
low-grade, organ -confined prostate cancer and excellent prospects of long term survival54-57. Substantial 
improvement in survival in men with prostate cancer has focused attention on the high prevalence of sexual 
dysfunction, physical dysfun ction, and low vitality in these men11-25, 58 -61, which are important contributors 
to poor quality of life among these patients11-18, 23. The pathophysiology of these symptoms - sexual 
dysfunction, fatigue/low vitality, and depressed mood - after radical p rostatectomy is multifactorial, but 
androgen deficiency is an important remediable contributor to these symptoms.  
 
2.2 IND Agent  
 
Preclinical and Phase I and II Experience with LY SARM  
LY SARM, an oral, tissue -specific SARM, displays agonist effects on sexual function, anabolic effects on the 
muscle and bone, with antagonist effect on the prostate. Because of its AR antagonist properties on the prostate, 
its application is also being exp lored for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer.  
There were no potentially serious or life threatening toxicities for LY SARM in preclinical toxicology 
studies. LY SARM -induced pharmacological effects consistent with androgen r eceptor agonism in repeat dose 
toxicological studies. The primary adverse effects in rats and dogs involved changes in reproductive organs 
consistent with the expected effects of an androgen receptor agonist. Safety pharmacology studies of up to 6 -
month du ration indicate a high safety margin for the drug.  In toxicological studies, LY SARM demonstrated no 
drug-related effects at doses up to 1000 mg/kg in gastrointestinal (GI), renal, pulmonary, and cardiovascular 
function studies.  
In gonadectomized rodent model, LY SARM demonstrated anabolic effects on muscle and 
osteoanabolic properties on bone mass and biomechanical strength at doses that had no significant effect on 
prostate and seminal vesicles. Its nearly complete selectivity for AR has been demonstrat ed in preclinical 
models, and in phase I and II human trials. LY SARM has demonstrated agonistic activity on sexual function 
(stimulated mating behavior, sexual arousal, NOS, and PDE5 expression).  
LY SARM has shown high degree of tissue selectivity. In a canine model, the administration of LY 
SARM was associated with a 40% reduction of prostate volume, consistent with its AR antagonist properties in 
the prostate. In mice bearing explants of AR+ prostate cancer, LY SARM suppressed the growth of explants.

 LY SARM has undergone testing in multiple phase I and II trials, which have established its safety in 
doses of up to 75 mg daily in humans. Clinical trials of up to 6 -month duration have been conducted. In phase I 
dose ranging studies of 21 day duration (f igure 1), LY SARM increased muscle volume by pQCT (figure 1, left 
panel) and suppressed PSA levels (figure 1, right panel), and exhibited no grade 2 or 3 toxicity.  LY SARM 
shares with other oral androgens the property of lowering HDL cholesterol as well a s total cholesterol modestly. 
These data demonstrate LY SARM’s safety and tissue selectivity; it is an agonist on the skeletal muscle and an 
antagonist on the prostate. Consequently, unlike testosterone or other androgens, LY SARM would not be 
expected to promote the growth of prostate cancer. This is analogous to the use of tamoxifen, a selective 
estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which acts as an agonist on the uterus and bone but as an antagonist in 
the breast tissue .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In phase II efficacy trials of 12 week duration, 5 mg LY SARM daily was demonstrated to be safe 
and increased lean body mass by ~1.5 kg and muscle volume (by  CT) by 4 -6%, and significantly 
reduced fat mass in line with other SARMs and replacement doses of testosterone.  There was an 
expected decrease in total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. No grade 2 or 3 toxicity was recorded.     
 
 
 
Several other SARM molecules have undergone phase I and II trials and one has undergone a 
phase III trial in patients with cancer cachexia. These trials have shown these SARM molecules to be 
generally safe. The class effects include a modest reversible decrease in total and HDL cholesterol, 
and mild transaminase elevations in a small fraction of subjects .

 Androgen deficiency in men who have undergone prostatectomy for organ -localized prostate cancer is 
common1-12 and often associated with bothersome symptoms13-17 and other adverse health effects that 
contribute to poor health -related quality o f life (HRQOL)18-23. Improved survival of men with prostate 
cancer has focused attention on strategies to treat symptoms and improve the overall HRQOL18-23.  
Androgen signaling plays an important role in prostate cancer growth24-31. Testosterone therapy pr omotes 
the growth of metastatic prostate cancer and androgen deprivation causes regression of metastatic prostate 
cancer32-34. Not surprisingly, the expert guidelines of many professional societies list prostate cancer as a 
contraindication for androgen su pplementation24-25. This proscriptive guidance does not fully reflect our 
new understanding of the complex relationship between testosterone and prostate cancer1-5, 34 -42. 
Epidemiologic studies have revealed no consistent relationship between testosterone levels and prostate 
cancer risk34-40.  
Several elegant studies have found little or no effect of testosterone administration on intraprostatic 
androgen concentrations or on androgen -dependent gene expression in the prostate41-42. Several open -label 
trials of testosterone have reported very low rates of disease recurrence in men with prostate cancer who 
have undergone radical prostatectomy1-11,43 -44. Consequently, testosterone use among men who have 
undergone radical prostatectomy has been increasing, even t hough neither the safety nor the efficacy of 
testosterone therapy in improving outcomes has been established in these patients. A confluence of 
historical factors – improved survival of men with prostate cancer, a growing recognition of the importance 
of symptom control in the lives of cancer survivors, increasing off -label use of testosterone in patients who 
have undergone radical prostatectomy, and accumulation of clinical experience from nonrandomized trials - 
has highlighted the need for randomized tria ls of androgen therapy in men with a history of prostate cancer, 
particularly for those, who experience symptoms of androgen deficiency – sexual dysfunction, fatigue, and 
physical dysfunction.  
Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a new class  of ligands that displays tissue -selective 
anabolic activity in the muscle, anti -resorptive and anabolic activity in bone, androgenic activity in 
maintaining sexual behavior, and robust selectivity for muscle versus prostate45-51. LY2452473 (LY 
SARM), a hi ghly selective SARM, is particularly attractive in men with prostate cancer because it displays 
agonist activity on sexual function and muscle but antagonist activity in the prostate in preclinical models 
and in human trials of up to 6 -month duration. Unli ke testosterone, LY SARM induces prostate atrophy in 
dogs and lowers PSA in men. Consequently, the administration of Lilly SARM would not be expected to 
increase the risk of disease recurrence; it is, in fact, possible that it may reduce prostate cancer re currence 
risk. This is analogous to the use of tamoxifen in women with breast cancer; tamoxifen, a selective estrogen 
receptor modulator (SERM), is an estrogen antagonist in the breast but an agonist on the endometrium and 
bone.  Thus, we believe that the clinical application of such a selective, prostate sparing SARM would be a 
very major scientific breakthrough.

 This will be a phase IIA randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group, double blind  trial in men, 19 years 
of age or older, who have undergone radical prostatectomy for organ -localized prostate cancer, have low 
testosterone levels and associated symptoms, and are deemed to be at low risk of  recurrence. At the end, a 
total of 135  subjects will have been randomized ; 36, 28, 26 and 14 men to placebo, 1 mg, 5 mg and 15 mg 
doses , respectively .   
 
3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
 
3.1.1 Age 19 years  or older .   
3.1.2 Prostate cancer, w ith organ -localized disease with very low risk of disease recurrence, as indicated by 
Stage pT2, N0, M0 lesions (if AJCC staging is not available in medical records, the investigators will 
infer the staging based on extensive review of the pathology report), combined Gleason score of 7 (3+4)  
or less, and preoperative PSA<10 ng/ml .The rationale for selecting men with these criteria is that this 
group of men has <0.5% disease recurrence rate over ten years  [if pre -operative PSA is not available in 
medical records,  low-risk subjects with a Gleason score of 6(3+3) and who are at least 5 years out of 
surgery will be considered for enrollment].  
3.1.3 Stable and undetectable PSA level (PSA <0.1 ng/mL using an assay that has a functional sensitivity of 
0.1 ng/mL) for at least t wo years after radical prostatectomy  
3.1.4 Serum testosterone, measured by LC -MS/MS, <300 ng/dL and/or calculated free testosterone ≤70 
pg/mL.  
3.1.5 Self-reported sexual dysfunction  (DISF -M-II score ≤20  in the sexual desire domain ), and/or fatigue  
(FACIT -F score <30), or physical dysfunction  (self-reported difficulty in walking a 1/4 mile or climbing 
two flights of stairs, and short physical performance battery score (SPPB) between 4 to 9) .  
3.1.6 Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document . 
3.1.7 Agreeing  to use adequate contraception prior to receiving the study  drug, for the duration of study 
participation, and 4 months after completion of LY SARM  administration.  The effects of LY2452473 
(LY SARM)  on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this reason and because  SARM  agents are 
known to be teratogenic, women of child -bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate 
contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control , or abstinence) prior t o study entry and for 
the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while 
her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.   
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
3.2.1 Men who have  undergone radiation therapy alone will be excluded because defining biochemical 
recurrence can be difficult in these men due to fluctuating PSA levels.  
3.2.2 Prior or current androgen deprivation therapy  
3.2.3 Hematocrit >  50% 
3.2.4 Severe untreated sleep apnea  (treatment is defined as therapy with CPAP , BiPAP, ASV, or other 
positive air p ressure device ) 
3.2.5 Uncontrolled heart failure  as defined by New York Heart Association( NYHA )class  3 or 4  
3.2.6 History of HIV (protease inhibitors can have interaction with the SARM)  
3.2.7 Myo cardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization surgery, or stroke within 3 months  
3.2.8 Serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL; ALT or AST  outside normal limits  for the lab being used

3.3 Screening, Recruitment, and Enrollment  
 
Participant Screening  
 
Participants identified through institutional urology groups will be prescreened using medical records to 
determine if they are potentially eligible.  The potentially eligible subjects will be contacted for further 
screening.  If participants are intereste d, verbal consent will be obtained via an IRB approved script prior to 
administering a telephone screening with a standardized script and questionnaire.  
 
At the Brigham and Women’s Hospital site (BWH), use of EPIC and at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center (BIDMC) subject referring site, use of the PIMS will be utilized to identify potential study subjects.  
 
After obtaining consent, to determine eligibility, a directed medical history will be obtained and blood 
count, chemistries, total and free testo sterone, and PSA will be measured. The pathological stage and 
pretreatment PSA level will be obtained from medical records. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be 
scheduled for baseline studies.  
 
Participant Recruitment and Enrollment  
Participants w ill be enrolled from the urology clinics at BWH and BIDMC  (subject referring site only) , 
from the oncology clinics at Dana Farber Cancer Center at the Boston site , from the Brady Urological 
Research Institute at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute at the Baltimore site , and from the urology clinics  
and from the general community  at the UFL site . At BWH w e also will employ direct mailing s to patients 
with prostate ca ncer identified through the institutional urology groups and medical records, institutional 
portals such as the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR ) and Research Study Volunteer Program (RSVP ), 
whose use for subject recruitment has been IRB -approved.  
 
RPDR is a centralized clinical data registry, or data warehouse. The RPDR gathers data from various 
hospital legacy systems and stores it in one place. The  RPDR has two related but separate functions. First, 
an online Query Tool provides users with aggregate  numbers of patients with user -defined characteristics 
such as diagnoses, procedures and/or laboratory results. Patient identifiers are not available at this function 
level. Secondly, the RPDR Data Acquisition Engine (DAE) allows the user to receive more d etailed medical 
record information about the queried patients.  
 
Research Study Volunteer Program (RSVP for Health)  is a database that allows researchers to search by 
disease area, age, race, gender, and ethnicity. Once the researcher identifies the population they 'd like to 
contact, RSVP for Health sends potential volunteers an email containing the IRB -approved study 
announcement and prepares letters for those who w ish to be contacted through US mail. The identity of 
potential volunteers is maintained until they choose to contact the research team .

 4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible pa rticipants with the DF/HCC  Office of Data Quality (ODQ) central 
registration system. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of  protocol therapy. Any participant not 
registered to the protocol before protocol therapy  begins will be considered inel igible and registration will 
be denied.  
 
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the (ODQ) 
protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 
Patients are randomized at the time of registration, and treatment assignment will be communicated to each 
respective site investigational pharmacy so that the proper treatment assignment can be allocated to each 
patient.  The biostatistician will provide the (ODQ) Registrars with the treatment assignment list prior to 
study activation. At the time of registration, the confirmation of registration would be sent to the study team, 
while the treatment assignment would be sent directly to pharmacy.  
 
Following registration, participants  may begin pro tocol therapy . Issues that would  cause treatment delays 
should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). Notify the (ODQ) Registr ar of registration 
cancellations  as soon as possible.  
 
4.2 Registration Process for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 
The (ODQ) registration staff is accessible on Monday through Friday, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern 
Standard Time. In emergency situations when a participant must begin protocol therapy  during off -hours or 
holidays, call the (ODQ) registration line at 6 17-632-3761 and follow the instructions for registering 
participants after hours.  
 
The registration procedures are as follows:  
 
• Obtain written informed consent from the participant prior  to the performance of any protocol  
specific procedures or assessments .  
 
• Complete the (ODQ) protocol -specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment 
documented in the participant ’s medical  record and/or  research chart. To be eligible for registration 
to the protocol , the participant must meet all inclusion and exclusion criterion  as described in 
the protocol and reflected on the eligibility checklist.  
 
• Reminder : Confirm eligibility for ancillary studies at the same time as eligibility for a  treatment 
protocol. Registration to both treatment and anc illary protocols will not be completed if eligibility 
requirements are not met for all studies.  
 
• Fax the eligibility checklist(s) and all pages of the consent form(s) to the (ODQ) at 617 -632-2295.  
For Phase I protocols, attach participant dose level assig nment confirmation from the sponsor.  
 
• The (ODQ) Registrar will (a) review the  eligibility  checklist , (b) register the participant on the 
protocol, and (c) randomize the participant when  applicable.

• An email  confirmation of the registration will be sent to the Overall PI, study coordinator(s) from the 
Lead Site, treating investigator and registering person immedia tely following the registration . 
Treatment assignment will be sent directly to pharmacy via fax.  
 
4.3 General Guidelines  for Other Investigative  Sites  
 
Eligible participants  will be entered in to the  study centrally at th e Brigham and Women’s Hospital  by the 
Study Coordinator.   
 
Following registration, participants should begin protocol therapy  within 5 days. Issues  that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed  with the Overall PI.   The Study Coordinator should be notified of 
cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
Research activities for participants originating from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will occur at 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital and will be registered by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital study 
coordinator.  Participants referred from BIDMC will continue their routine clinical care outside of the 
research protocol.  
 
4.4 Registration Process  for Othe r Investigative  Sites  
 
The registration process for other investigative sites is located in the DSMP in section 15.7.1.  
 
 
5. TREATMENT AND/OR IMAGING PLAN  
 
5.1 Criteria and Process for Unblinding  
In both urgent and non -urgent situations: Only the trial’s Data and Safety Monitoring Board is authorized to 
request unblinding of participant -level intervention assignment in one or more subjects in non -urgent 
situations should a safety concern so warrants. In urgent situations, the Principal Investigator may direct t he 
study physician to unblind the intervention assignment should this information be deemed necessary by the 
patient’s primary care provider or emergency department clinician to manage an urgent medical condition.   
 
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
 
LY SARM or Placebo will be administered daily  for a period of 12 weeks .  LY SARM  or Placebo  will be 
dispensed to the subject in pill form in four week supplies.  The drug  or placebo  will be dispensed at  
baseline ( Visit 2b) , week 4, and week8.   Reported adverse events and pote ntial risks are described in 
Secti on 7.  No investigational or prohibited  therapies other than those described below may be administered  
during the course of this study . 
 
The study medication should be taken daily in the morning on an empty stomach at about the same time 
each day.  The medication should be swallowed whole with water.  The bottle containing the medication 
should be stored at room temperature.  The medication does not need refrigeration.  If the subject vomits 
after taking the dose  and se es the study drug capsule in the emesis , he should wait for an hour and then 
retake a new capsule of the medication.  If the subject does not see the study drug capsule in the emesis, he 
should not take another dose.  If the subject forgets to take the dru g in the morning and remembers it later 
during the day including bedtime, he should go ahead and take the drug for that day as soon as it is

 remembered.  The medication is best taken in the morning on a fasting stomach at least 30 minutes before 
any meal , although  if the participant forgets to take a dose but remembers later in the day, he should take the 
medication at that time. It may not be practical for many individuals, who are employed, to fast during the 
day.   Breakfast can be eaten 30 minutes or la ter after taking the study medication.  There are no prohibited 
foods.  The drug is supplied in capsules. At one time, subjects will be provided sufficient medicine for a 
period of 4 weeks. At the end of the 4 week period, they should return any unused med ication to the study 
staff along with the filled –in drug diary.  
 
We will measure compliance using medication logs and pill counts, which provide the best trade -off 
between accuracy and cost283-284. The participant  will be requested to maintain a medicatio n diary of each 
dose of medication  that will be provided to them by the study staff .  The medication diary will be returned 
to clinic  staff at the end of each cycle .  Furthermore, pill counts will be done to measure compliance.   
Medication logs will be col lected and unused pills will be counted. Adherence will be assessed as number of 
pills used divided by number of days.  
 
1. LY2452473 is supplied as an oral capsule drug product in size 2 opaque white  gelatin capsules. Each 
capsule contains 1 mg, 5 mg  or 15 mg of LY2452473 and the inactive ingredients pregelatinized starch 
and dimethicone. LY2452473 is intended to be supplied for the proposed clinical trial as capsules 
packaged in 30 count white, induc tion sealed high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child -
resistant closures.  
2. The drug product will be packaged and supplied to the IDS by Catalent Pharma Solutions, Kansas 
City, Missouri, USA.  
3. The drug product will be stored at room temperature (25 °C) with allowable excursions between 15 - 
30°C.  
4. The drug will be dispensed by the IDS in an amount sufficient for 30 days.  
5. The IDS will release the study medication to an authorized study staff upon receipt of a prescription 
written and signed by a study  clinician . The study staff will dispense the study medication to the 
participant in accordance with the study protocol along with a set of written instructions on how to 
take the medication.  
6. The study staff will retrieve the unused medication from the par ticipant for the purpose of assessing 
adherence.    
 
Subject Intervention  
The study intervention includes placebo and three  doses of LY SARM ( 1, 5 and 15 mg daily). Subjects who 
meet the eligibility criteria, will be randomized, to either placebo, 1 mg SARM, 5 mg SARM or 15 mg 
SARM daily.  The subject assignment will be based on the randomization tables, using permuted blocks 
with varying blocks sizes. Subjects will be stratified by age (19 -50 and >50) and use of phosphodiesterase 5 
inhibitors (PDEI s); PDEIs may influence sexual function (and mood and HRQOL) independently228-231. 
Stratification variables will be included as covariates in analyses.  
 
SARM Doses and Regimen  
The participants will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo , 1 mg LY SARM,  5 mg LY SARM, or 
15 mg LY SARM daily for 12 weeks. In phase II trials of up to 6 -month duration, these doses were safe and 
effective in increasing lean body mass. 5 mg dose increased fat -free mass by an average 1.5 kg in men.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120 
Protocol Version Date: 02/05/2019  
14 
 Intervention Duration  
The effects of SARM as well as testosterone on sexual function, muscle mass, strength, well being and 
mood become apparent within 3 months48, 171 -177; PSA levels rise within 3 -4 weeks and reach a plateau by 
12-weeks109-110. Thus, 3 -month duration will be s ufficient to detect meaningful changes in outcomes and 
PSA.  
 
Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors Use  
PDEIs may independently affect sexual function (and HRQOL)226-231. To minimize confounding due to 
PDEI use, we will stratify randomization based on PDEI use. PDEI  use will be used as a covariate in 
analyses.  
 
5.3 Pre-Treatment Criteria  
 
Prior to subject’s enrollment, the s tudy coordinators will explain the purpose of the study, the study 
procedures, and potential risks and benefits of participation in this trial, and answer any questions. The 
subjects will be asked to sign the IRB -approved consent form. To determine eligibi lity, a directed medical 
history will be obtained , and blood count, chemistries, total and free testosterone, and PSA will be 
measured. The pathological stage and pretreatment PSA level will be obtained from medical records. 
Subjects meeting eligibility cr iteria will be scheduled for baseline studies. Subjects, who meet the eligibility 
criteria will undergo  baseline studies, which include baseline complete blood count, blood chemistries, and 
baseline assessment of physical function, sexual function, fatigue , as described in the protocol. The subjects 
who are eligible and have completed the baseline assessments will be randomized.  
 
5.4 Agent Administration  
 
Administration –The dose will be 0 mg  (placebo) , 1 mg, 5 mg, or 15 mg of LY SARM  depending upon 
which stud y group that the subject is randomly assigned to.  LY SARM  or Placebo  will be taken orally, 
once per day.  The intervention period is twelve weeks.  Subjects will be given the drug in four week 
supplies at  baseline (Visit 2b ), week 4 and week 8.  Their compliance will be measured by pill counts at 
week 4, week 8 and week 12.   In addition, medication logs will be given to subjects.  
 
Protocol specific procedures –A study physician will obtain consent. The safety laboratory result s will be 
reviewed by one of the study physicians. During each visit, a research coordinator will ask the participants 
about any adverse events. A study clinician  will perform a physical examination at screening  and during 
weeks 6 and 12. A study  physician  will be available if an issue arises at the study visits with the research 
coordinator.  
 
The research  staff will take interim status during baseline, week s 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12.  During interim status, 
the subject will be asked questions about any changes in health or medication.  Blood tests will be done at 
screening, baseline, as well as  during week s 2, 4, 6,  and 12.  DXA and strength asses sments will be 
performed at baseline and during week 12.   
 
Infusion Reactions – Subjects will be monitored for PSA level, hematocrit, hemoglobin , HDL level, and 
liver enzymes.  
 
Sometimes due to scheduling issues, staff availab ility, inclement weather or subject availability, we may ask 
the subject  to return to our research clinic in order to complete a visit  or a specific procedure  at a different 
time or day. This may affect some of the procedures at any visit. In case of such an event, if the subject

 parks in ou r valet parking area, their  parking will be validated.  
 
The investigators may omit any strength assessments (muscle performance or physical function procedures) 
for safety purposes. In such instances, the investigators will determine which procedures will  be omitted and 
this will be documented in the subject’s study file.   
 
Caregiver Precautions -

 The case report form will be developed to capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over -the-counter 
medications, or alternative therapies.   
 
• The use of the foll owing medications if not allowed during the course of  the study: testosterone, 
DHEA, estrogens, GnRH analogs, antiandrogens, spironolactone, ketoconazole, rhGH, megesterol 
acetate, prednisone 20 mg daily or equivalent doses of other glucocorticoids  
 
5.6 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
 
Treatment will continue for 12 weeks or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• An increase in PSA to 0.2 ng/mL or higher, if confirmed by a repeated test, will result in treatment 
discontinuation and referral to a urologist.  An increase in PSA will b e confirmed by a repeat test which 
may result in removal from the study.  The study team will contact the participant within a week after 
test result becomes available for scheduling the repeat test if the first test revealed an increase in PSA. 
If the repe at test confirms the elevation, the intervention will be stopped and the participant will 
continue to be followed in the study per intent -treat analytical design. The study medication will 
continue until the results of the repeated test become available. The participant will also be referred to 
a urologist, medical oncologist, or a primary care provider depending on the nature of the problem. If 
the repeat test does not confirm the elevation, the participant will continue in the study and have the 
next set of lab tests per study protocol.  
• Any other sign of disease recurrence (e.g., evidence of bone metastasis detected by the subject’s 
oncologist)  
• Myocardial infarction or stroke   
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillin gness to comply with the oral medication regimen 
and/or documentation requirements  
• Participan t decide s to withdraw from the protocol therapy  
• General or  specific changes in the participant's condition render the participan t unacceptable for 
further treatment in t he judgment of the treating investigator  
• Other DLTs include hematocrit increase above 54% and transaminase elevation above 1.25 times the 
upper l imit of normal, confirmed by repeating these tests.  An increase in hematocrit and transaminase 
will be confirmed by a repeat test which may result in removal from the study.  The study team will 
contact the participant within a week after test result become s available for scheduling the repeat test 
if the first test revealed an increase in hematocrit or transaminases. If the repeat test confirms the 
elevation, the intervention will be stopped and the participant will continue to be followed in the study 
per intent -treat analytical design. The study medication will continue until the results of the repeated 
test become available. The participant will also be referred to a urologist, medical oncologist, or a 
primary care provider depending on the nature of the problem. If the repeat test does not confirm the 
NCI Protocol #:  Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120 
Protocol Version Date: 02/05/2019  
17 
 elevation, the participant will continue in the study and have the next set of lab tests per study protocol.  
Any abnormal liver function test, defined by a value that is greater than 1.25 times the upper lim it of 
normal, will also require a repeat blood test within 3 -7 days, to confirm the result and observe the 
trend. If the participant’s levels do not exceed 1.25 times the upper limit of normal, they will continue 
on the study medication and transaminases w ill be monitored.  
 
 
Note that f or an abnormal lab value to meet the DLT definition, the lab test must be repeated and the repeat 
test must confirm the elevation.  
 
If the participants experience a grade 4 non -hematological toxicity, the study medication w ill be stopped and 
the participant will be referred to his medical oncologist, urologist, or the primary care provider depending 
on the nature of the toxicity. However, study assessments will continue per study’s intent -to-treat design.  
 
Participants  will be removed from the protocol therapy  when any of the se criteria apply.  The reason for 
removal from protocol therapy, and the date the participant was removed , will be documented in the case 
report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  
 
A ODQ Treatment E nded/Off Study Form will  be filled out when a participant is removed from protocol 
therapy. This form can be found on the ODQ website or obtained from the ODQ registration staff.  The 
QACT Treatment Ended/Off Study Form will be completed by each site and then sent the Coordinating 
Center for all study participants.  
 
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, treatin g investigators must immediately notify the 
Overall PI,  Shalender Bhasin, MD  at 617-525-9040 .  
 
5.7 Duration of Follow Up  
 
The subjects who come off the study medication for disease recurrence or adverse events will be referred to 
their urologist or medical oncologist or primary care provider for further evaluation and treatment, 
depending on the nature of the problem. Because of the intent -to-treat analytical design, they will continue 
to be followed in the study for further study assessments per pro tocol.  
 
5.8 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study  
 
Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply:  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Death  
Consistent with the intent -to-treat primary analytical strategy, we will encourage all  participants, including 
those in whom the study medication is discontinued because of the reasons listed above, to continue with 
their follow -up study assessments.  
 
The reason for taki ng a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, will be documented 
in the case report form (CRF).  
 
NCI Protocol #:  Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120

18 
 A ODQ Treatment E nded/Off Study Form will  be filled out when a  participant  comes off study. This form 
can be found on the ODQ website o r obtained from the ODQ registration staff.  
 
The ODQ Treatment Ended/Off Study Form will be completed by each site and then sent to the 
Coordinating Center for all study participants.  
 
5.9 Study Stopping Rules  
 
In light of  the phase I and II trials data, we anticipate very low rates of grade II or III toxicity. The main 
reason for trial’s early termination would be unexpectedly high rates of PSA recurrence. By virtue of the 
eligibility criteria, this population should have very low recurrence rates (<0.5% over 5 years).  
 
Among the first 50 enrolled subjects, we assume that we should have about 16 in placebo and about 34 or so 
in the two SARM arms.   
 
In the control group, we expect a recurrence rate of <0.5% over 5 years (f or the purpose of this calculation, we 
assumed a recurrence rate of 0.5% over 5 years). We will accept a difference of no more than 3 between the 
placebo and the   SARM arms in aggregate after 50 subjects have been randomized. If the PSA recurrence 
occurs in 3 or more cases in the two SARM arms in aggregate or 3 or more cases in any one SARM arm, the 
DSMB may stop the trial. The probability of a single recurrence is 0.005 (probability of 'not recurrent' is 
0.995 at 5 years). Thus, if the bar is set at 3 rec urrences, the probability of making an error and stopping early 
when in fact there is no extra risk conferred by SARM is only 1 in 1250.    
 
At 4 or more recurrences, the chance of erroneous early stoppage is 1 in 25000, which seems large. Therefore, 
we sub mit that a difference of 3 recurrences between the placebo arm and the 2 SARM arms in aggregate is 
reasonable as a stopping rule that DSMB will consider in its decision. The DSMB has the discretion of 
stopping the trial for other reasons.  
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/D OSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
No dose modifications are allowed. Dose modification is not planned in the context of this double blind 
phase II randomized trial for several reasons. One aim of the trial is to assess the dose response relationship 
of dose with the stud y’s outcomes, which could be compromised if the dose adjustment were to occur. The 
study is blinded; dose adjustment may unblind the study. Also, the drug will be manufactured in either 1 
mg, 5 mg  or 15 mg capsules. Therefore, we do not have any mechanism for administering intermediate 
doses.  Furthermore, based on the preclinical animal data, and phase I and II previous human studies, we 
anticipate very low frequency of DLT. Also, we do not have any previous data to guide rational dose 
adjustment.  
 
If the subject forg ets to take one or more doses, he  will be asked to record the missed doses in the 
medication log and re -initiate  the usual daily dosing. Study staff will encourage all participants to take all 
the pills as specified in the protocol. We will also perform pill counts and use drug logs to monitor 
compliance. However, because of the intent -to-treat analytical plan, the participants will continue in the 
study for their assessments per protocol.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of 
NCI Protocol #:  Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120 
Protocol Version Date: 02/05/2019  
19 
 reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedi ted reporting  in addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
7.1 Adverse Event List(s) for LY SARM  
In previous phase I and II studies of LY SARM, the drug was well tolerated and no drug -related grade II or III 
toxicities were recorded. A modest decrease in total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol was noted, which is a 
class effect of oral androgens. There were no clinically significant changes in liver function. No significant 
change s in hemoglobin and hematocrit were noted. In phase I studies, a decrease in PSA was noted.  The class 
effects of oral androgens and SARMs include a decrease in total and HDL cho lesterol, increase in hematocrit 
(not observed with this SARM), and mild increases in AST and ALT. There may also be a risk of disease 
recurrence although that risk would be very small because of LY SARM’s selectivity.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised 
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE 
reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas sho uld have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent (s) that are  listed above  should be reported only if the adverse event varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from  the expected  toxicity  information which is provided.  
- Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporti ng are outlined in the next

The plasma concentration -time profiles for LY2452473 after single dose up to 1000 mg showed 
measurable concentrations from 1 hour postdose, with maximum observed drug concentrations C max 4 to 
5 hours following dosing. The LY2452473 concentrations appeared to decline in a biexponential fashion 
characterized by a short distribution phase and a long terminal phase, with median terminal half -lives (t 1/2) 
ranging between 26.6 and 55.1 hours ac ross doses. Mean apparent oral clearance was low to moderate, 
ranging from 10.9 to 41.5 L/h across dose levels. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state 
(Vss/F) ranged from 388 to 2290 L across doses. Multiple dosing at 1 mg and 5 mg of LY2 452473, also 
showed decline in a biexponential fashion characterized by a short distribution phase and a long terminal 
phase, with median terminal t ½ ranging between 23.3 and 44.4 hours across doses The variability of C max 
at steady state (C max,ss) ranged from 14% to 84% across dose levels. The variability of AUC over the 
dosing interval at steady state (AUC [τ,ss]) ranged from 9% to 70% across dose levels. The pharmacokinetic 
characteristics observed supported once daily (QD) dosing.

10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
10.1 Primary Outcome  
Our primary outcome is change in sexual activity score, assessed by the Harbor -UCLA 7 -day Sexual Function 
Questionnaire, because sexual dysfunction is one of the most prevalent symptoms in men, who have undergone 
radical prostatectomy, and it affects HRQOL . This scale has been used widely in testosterone trials, and sexual 
activity scores, assessed by this instrument, are responsive to therapy. The scale covers 3domains: 1) sexual desire 
and enjoyment;2) sexual activity; and 3) mood.  
 
10.2 Secondary outcomes  
Other measures of sexual function.  Erectile function will be assessed by IIEF , SAID,  and DISF -M-II.  
The IIEF  which has been validated in many trials of ED therapies, and shown to be responsive to androgen therapy 
in men with ED and low testosterone. The IIEF is a  15-item questionnaire  that evaluates 5 response domains, 
including erectile function, intercourse sa tisfaction, and overall satisfaction. It has been shown to have high degree 
of specificity and sensitivity, reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity.  
The DISF -M-IIis a 25-item questionnaire that provides an estimate of perceived quality o f sexual activities in 5 
response domains : sexual desire/dr ive, sexual arousal, s exual activity , orgasm, and sexual satisfaction/ partner 
relationship. It comprehensively evaluates sexual desire and has been shown to have  androgen -treatment sensitivity . 
The DIS F-M was the main sexual function questionnaire in the NIA -funded The Testosterone Trial which is a trial of 
800 men evaluating the role of androgens on sexual function.  
The SAID is a n 8-item questionnaire that evaluates 3 response domains, includin g sexual  thinking, sexual arousal, 
and sexual activity.  This questionnaire was validated  using separate qualitative studies and provides an assessment 
of items associated with hypogonadism291, 292. 
Sexual desire  will be assessed by Men’s Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) and by libido -related questions in 
IIEF, SAID,  and DISF -M-II. MSHQ, a25 -item questionnaire, provides a more robust assessment of libido than IIEF, 
especially in men with urogenital symptoms240, has high degree of internal consistency, reliability, and ability to 
discriminate between men with and without lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and sexual dysfunction.  
We will measure the impact of androgen deficiency and sexual dysfunction on HRQOL us ing the hormonal and 
sexual domains of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) . The EPIC is a 50 -item, disease -
specific HRQOL questionnaire designed to evaluate the impact of treatments on HRQOL in men with prostate 
cancer. Of its four domains,  we will utilize the sexual and hormonal domains, which are affected by androgen 
deficiency and expected to improve with SARM therapy, and which are important to men with prostate cancer but 
are not weighed appropriately in generic HRQOL instruments. This instrument has been used in numerous prostate 
cancer trials, and shown to have high Cronbach alpha coefficient , construct validity, and excellent sensitivity to 
change in response to hormonal treatment.  
Fatigue  will be assessed by the 13 -item Functional A ssessment of Chronic Illness Therapy fatigue scale (FACIT -F) 
and by the 4 -item Hypogonadism Energy Diary  (HED) .  
The FACIT -F has been well -validated and responsive to treatment. SF -36 Vitality scale has also been used to assess 
vitality, but the FACIT -F is more sensitive to change in those with low vitality/high fatigue than SF36. Another 
reason for selecting FACIT -F is its inclusion as “legacy instrument” for the NIH Roadmap PROMIS Fatigue item 
bank. This will ensure comparability to PROMIS.  
The HED has been  validated  using separate qualitative studies and provides an assessment of l ow energy related to 
hypogonadism291, 292. 
Mood  and well -being will be assessed by PANAS affectivity balance scale, which includes 10 questions each for 
Positive Affect and Ne gative Affect. Many behavioral scientists consider affectivity balance as the cleanest window 
on an individual’s wellbeing. The affectivity balance incorporates negative affects (e.g., anxiety, depression) as well 
NCI Protocol #: Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120 
Protocol Version Date:  09/12 /2018  
 
27 as positive affects (e.g., joy).Testostero ne has been reported to improve mood and affect in hypogonadal men. 
Alphas for negative and positive affect scales are 0.85 and 0.88, respectively; one -week test -retest reliabilities are 
0.81 and 0.79. The instrument can detect changes in well being relate d to chronic illnesses and cancer.  
Muscle Performance and Physical Function.  We will assess physical function by measuring walking speed in the 
6-min walk, stair climbing power, and load carrying time, self -reported physical function by the PF10 (physical 
function domain of MOS SF -36), maximal voluntary strength in the leg press exercise by the 1 -RM method, and 
skeletal muscle mass by dual energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA). We have used these measures in many previous 
trials and they have been shown to be a ndrogen -responsive .  
Hormone Levels. Total testosterone, DHT and estradiol will be measured by LC -MS/MS, free testosterone by 
equilibrium dialysis, and LH by an IFMA. These methods have been used in PI’s lab for >25 yrs.  
Safety measures : We will measure P SA, complete blood counts, plasma lipids, AST, ALT, bilirubin and alkaline 
phosphatase levels for safety monitoring.  A structured evaluation of cardiovascular adverse events will be 
performed using a form, developed for NIA -funded T trials.  
Physiologic me asures. We will measure lean body mass using dual energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA), and 
maximal voluntary strength as mediators of improvements in physical function. VO 2max and to a lesser extent VO 2 
peak are markers of a person’s aerobic capacity. The la ctate threshold is a marker of one’s capacity for prolonged, 
submaximal work without lactate accumulation and fatigue. We recognize that relationships of these physiologic 
mechanisms for aerobic energy production to fatigue are complex because in addition to these physiologic 
mechanisms, psychological factors, such as depressive symptoms, mood and wellbeing affect an individual’s 
perception of fatigue; accordingly, we will also assess mood and depressive symptoms.  We propose to split the 
assessments for mus cle performance and physical function into two non -consecutive days of testing in order to 
reduce subject burden and ensure more accurate data . 
At baseline , we propose to perform the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPXT) alone on the first day of baseline 
testing . It is a longer test requiring progressively increasing subject effort to volitional fatigue and requires about 60 
minutes to administer. It also prov ides valuable safety data that may be used prior to other physical function 
assessments. T he remainder of the tests (the 6 -minute walk test, the stair climb power tests, the 50 -m walk tests, and 
the leg press strength test )will be administered on the secon d day of baseline testing with appropriate and 
standardized rest periods between tests.

periods between tests.  
For the Week -12 (end of study) assessments, efforts will be made to repeat the test procedures in the same sequence 
and time of day; however, they could be altered to accommodate subject convenience and scheduling.

NCI Protocol #: Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120 
Protocol Version Date:  09/12 /2018  
 
29 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
12.1 Descriptive Analyses  
 
Descriptive measures for each outcome and potential covariate will be computed. Graphical and tabular displays 
will be used to establish the distributional properties of outcomes and assess need for transformation. Preliminary 
assessments of association between covari ates and outcomes will be obtained using semiparametric penalized 
likelihood approach implemented in generalized additive models256. We will use summary statistics and graphical 
techniques to compare baseline characteristics of groups.  
 
12.2 Compliance Analysis  
 
Subject’s compliance will be assessed in terms of the number of doses used, based on pill counts, expressed as a 
percent of the total number of doses that should have been used.  
 
12.3 Analytic plan  
 
Following appropriate variable transformations, the primary analysis will utilize mixed effects regression controlling 
for baseline values, randomization, and stratification. Primary inferential targets of interest will be difference in 
outcomes measures b etween the 4 arms, estimated using treatment contrasts. Secondary analyses will incorporate 
control for additional factors based on the results of exploratory analyses mentioned above.  We will consider the 
possibility of potential bias due to  three  stages of enrollment by performing sensitiv ity analyses  with stage effect 
adjustment293,294.Missing data will be accommodated using multiple imputation, with imputed values generated in 
accordance with the mixed effects model as implemented in the mice library in R257-259. Point estimates will be 
accompanied by 95% confidence intervals, and type -I error probability for hypothesis testing set at 0.05. Statistical 
analyses will be conducted using SAS version 9.3 or higher and R version 2.15.0.  
Specific Ai m 1 is concerned with change in sexual function as measured by the Harbor -UCLA 7 -day Sexual 
Function Questionnaire (SFQ) and other outcomes measured at baseline and during weeks 6 and 12. Six and 12 
week data will be analyzed simultaneously using mixed eff ects linear regression controlling for baseline measures as 
well as stratification factors (age and PDEI use), with site and subject treated as random effects. The primary 
analysis will be supplemented by comparisons of 12 week change in function, estimate d via treatment contrast with 
statistical significance evaluated via likelihood ratio test. We will also compare the proportion of men achieving 
increase of >1 point on sexual function score (thought to approximate the minimal clinically important differen ce on 
the SFQ) using generalized estimating equations256 and modified Poisson regression approach257-259, which can 
accommodate repeated measurements and is preferable to odds ratio in prospective designs. If the rate of 
improvement is very low, a zero -inflated alternative will be considered210.  
 
Secondary Hypotheses . Specific Aim 2 is concerned with estimation of the effects of SARM administration on 
well-being, affectivity balance, fatigue and HRQOL. These will be obtained at randomization and at 6 and 1 2 
weeks. We will follow an analytic plan parallel to that described for Aim 1. Aim 3  is concerned with the effects of 
SARM on strength and physical function. As in Aims 1 and 2 we will utilize mixed effects regression.  
We will also consider further explora tory analyses of the primary endpoint. For example, we will use linear 
regression to determine whether changes in muscle strength and measures of physical function correlate with 
changes in muscle mass and whether improvements in aerobic capacity are assoc iated with improved fatigue scores. 
Appropriate techniques will assess assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity.

30 12.4 Missing data  
 
All subjects who are randomized will be included in the analyses. We will use multiple imputation using chained 
equations ( MICE) to accommodate missing data. Further, our analyses will use simple linear mixed models that use 
additional intermediate time points when available. These methods use available information more efficiently, thus 
reducing type II error. We recognize th at missingness may be associated with outcome, in which case there exists 
the potential for biased estimates of treatment effect. Sensitivity analyses will be employed to assess this possibility.  
 
12.5 Sample Size Estimates and Power Considerations  
 
Initially, we  had estimate d that 126 men will be needed to test the primary hypothesis based on assumptions of two 
sided type I error rate of 0.05 , attrition rate of 20%  and 90% power. Our primary outcome is change in sexual 
activity score derived from Harbor -UCLA Seven Day Sexual Function Questionnaire221. The primary targets of 
estimation was overall dose effect as well as the direct comparison of highest dose group (1 5 mg) to placebo , 
however due to stoppage of 15 -mg dose group, the primary aim of this study will be comparison of 5 -mg group to 
placebo . There are no randomized trial data on the effects of SARM on sexual function in men with prostate cancer. 
In several tr ials in hypogonadal men178, 183 -184, testosterone therapy increased sexual activity score by an average of 
1.5 points. Here we assume that the difference of interest in the change in sexual activity score between the 15 mg 
dose and placebo over 3 months is  1.5 points with a standard deviation of 1.8  (1.27 within each group) . We estimate  
that the difference between 1 mg and placebo is 0.3 points with SD 1.2  and, as previously assumed, between 5 mg 
and placebo is 1.2  with SD 1.8 . Under these assumptions, group allocation of 36:28:36:14 (for placebo, 1mg, 5 mg 
and 15 mg  groups , respectively)  subjects per arm will achieve more than 95% power to reject the null hypothesis of 
no overall dose effect , and to detect the difference between the 15 mg group and placebo.  As enrollment to 15 -mg 
group has been stopped and insufficient number of participants were randomized to this group (N=14), there will not 
be any formal analysis testing difference between 15 -mg arm to placebo.  
 
We will similarly obtain good power to detect clinically meaningful effects on other measures of sexual function. 
We hypothesize that the mean difference in change in sexual desire scores between the 15 mg and placebo groups is 
1.8 (SD 2.1). The proposed s ample size has >95% power to detect this difference. Similarly, we will obtain >95% 
power to detect between group differences of 4 points in change in erectile function domain (EFD) of International 
Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF) (assumed SD 6 points ), a threshold deemed clinically significant222-225. The 
average increase in EFD score in trials of PDE5 inhibitors is 7153, 226 -228. 
 
Assuming mean (SD) LBM changes of 0 (1) kg in placebo, 0.8 (1.2) at 1 mg, 1.5 (2.1) kg at 5 mg  and 1.8 (2.1)  kg at 
15 mg dose,  simulation results indicate that this design achieves more than 90% power to demonstrate an overall 
dose-response relationship and to detect the advantage of 15 mg dose over placebo , where both tests are performed 
at the 0.05 level. Using the Holm -Bonferroni correction for these two non -independent hypotheses (both hypotheses 
must be rejected at the 0.05 level, and at least one at the 0.025 level, preserving the overall type -I error rate of 0.05), 
results indicate that the design achieves more than 80% power to reject both nulls simultaneously. Recent SARM 
trials have reported average gains of ~1.5 kg in lean body mass45, 48,116. In a testosterone trial in HIV -infected men, a 
difference of 2.9 kg in fat -free mass was observed between testosterone and p lacebo groups173. Testosterone trials in 
older men that used smaller doses of testosterone observed an increase of ~1.5 kg186.  
 
We anticipate that the change in leg press strength at 15 mg dose will be 15 kg (SD 18), at 5 mg dose 12 kg (SD 18 
kg) and at the 1 mg dose 4 kg (SD 6 kg) , while placebo group is assumed to have no increase (SD 6) . This 
assumption is based on testosterone trials in older men175,195, HIV -infected men173, and in  men with COPD185. A 1 5

31  kg increase in leg press strength is deemed clinically significant because a 10 kg increase in leg strength was 
associated with improvements in walking speed232. Under these assumptions, simulation results demonstrate that the 
planned randomization  will provide >90% power to jointly detect an overall dose-response  pattern  and a significant  
difference between  the5 mg and placebo groups. In a SARM trial48, the increase in stair climbing power in men 
receiving enobosarm averaged 15% (S D 20%). The proposed sample size provides >80% power to detect a similar 
difference between 5 mg and placebo arms. For physical function domain of MOS -SF36, the difference of interest 
between 5 mg and placebo group is 4 points (SD 7 points), which is a mod erate effect.  
 
In randomized trials in older men with low testosterone, the difference in change in physical function domain score 
between testosterone and placebo groups was 4 points186. Ware et al233 have determined that a 4 -point change in the 
physical  function domain of the MOS SF36 score is clinically meaningful. A proposed sample size  provides >80% 
power to detect this effect size  between placebo and 5 mg dose group .   
 
Absent intervention, the clinical PSA recurrence rate in this group of men should be <1% over 10 years54-57, so that 
few, if any clinical recurrences, are expected in the placebo arm over the three -month trial duration. We likewise 
anticipate few if any recurrences among subjects randomized to SARM. To insure that analyses are se nsitive to even 
limited evidence of safety concerns, we will conduct a one-sided  comparison of the proportion of subjects 
experiencing events in each arm using a Fisher’s exact test with type -I error probability set at 0.20, as recommended 
by some FDA pane ls. Assuming recurrence risk on placebo is 1%, this comparison will have 85% power to detect 
an increased risk of 10% in the 15 mg group.  
 
To accommodate attrition of up to 20%, we will enroll 37:25:37:36  men (for placebo, 1 mg, 5 mg and 15 mg groups, 
respectively) for a total of 1 35 men. Assumption of 20% attrition rate is conservative; the attrition in our 
testosterone trial in older men was 12%174. Even in a 3 -year intervention trial to determine the effects  of testosterone 
on atherosclerosis, the loss -to-follow -up has been <20%. The incorporation of 6 -week measurement in the mixed 
effects model and the inclusion of all 114 subjects made possible by use of multiple imputation will provide even 
higher power th an that claimed here.  
 
12.6 DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
The Data Management Center (DMC) will provide data management and statistical programming under the 
supervision of Dr. Travison. A randomization application will be available online. Upon completion of Eligibility 
Form, a subject ID will be generated , and the randomization table will be queried for study arm designation. 
Database will track subjects, provide documentation of eligibility and consent, and provide alerts to study staff 
about due dates. The database will reside on a secure, password protec ted server, and backed up on a nightly basis. 
The DMC will prepare standardized data collection forms to ensure that all data fields are unambiguous, items are 
easily read, response categories are in standardized units, and the instructions are clearly wor ded. Validation rules 
including built -in edits such as range and logic checks will be incorporated into the verification process. After forms 
have been verified, programming codes will check across -form internal inconsistencies. The statistical programmer 
will be responsible for cleaning the data, creating analytic data sets, standardized protocols for coding data, and a 
data dictionary of variables, and for writing the analysis code for all analyses.  
 
The target sample size is 114 participants  study -wide .  In order to randomize 114 subjects, we estimate that we will 
need 450 subjects to enroll (sign consent).  The study intervention includes placebo and t hree doses of LY SARM ( 
1, 5 and 15 mg daily).   It is planned for the recruitment to be split among the  Brigham and Womens Hospital 
(BWH), the University of Florida (UFL),  and Johns Hopkins Medical Institute s (JHMI).  Ultimately , it is planned to  
have 6 8 subjects randomized at BWH , 27 subjects randomized at UFL,  and 40 subjects randomized at Johns

32 Hopkins Med ical Institute.  A target sample size of 114 participants from two trial sites will have >90% power to 
test the primary hypothesis.  
 
Randomization : After protocol amendment, last 10 subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to 
either the placebo or 5mg SARM daily.  Due to inclusion of new treatment arm (15 mg) in the study and stopping 
enrollment into the 1 mg group, and later stopping enrollment into the 15 -mg group, participants will have been 
randomized in three stages. In th e first stage, then=80 subjects were randomized to one of 3 groups: placebo, 1 mg 
and 5 mg, with allocation ratio of 1:1:1; this randomization scheme was ended after the amendment was approved. 
In the second stage, (according to protocol amendment, after s topping the enrolment in 1 mg group and inclusion of 
new 15 mg LYSARM dose group) N=24 participants were randomized with allocation ratio of 1:1:3 to placebo, 5 
mg and 15 mg groups, respectively. In the third stage, after stopping the enrollment in 15 -mg g roup, due to safety 
signal, we anticipate to randomize 10 more participants with allocation ratio 3:2 (6 in placebo and and 4 in 5 -mg 
dose). At the end of the trial we expect to enroll 114 participants (80 in the first stage, 24 in the second stage and 10 
in the third stage) with group allocation of 36:28:36:14 participants, for placebo, 1 mg, 5 mg and 15 mg groups, 
respectively. . The subject assignment will be based on the randomization tables, using permuted blocks with varying 
blocks sizes. Subjects will  be stratified by age (19 -50 and >50) and use of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDEIs); 
PDEIs may influence sexual function (and mood and HRQOL) independently228-231. Stratification variables will be 
included as covariates in analyses.  
 
12.7 Sample Size, Accrual Rate  and Study Duration  
 
The revised planned sample size is 114.  Enrollment is targeted to be completed in 3years from start of study 
initiation.  We anticipate that enrollment will average 4 5 subjects  per year over the three years.  If enrollment is 
slower at the start, efforts will be enhanced to meet the 3 year enrollment goal.  There is a 12 -week intervention 
period after the screening and baseline measures are obtained.  Section 9 of this document contains the Schedule of 
Events. Women are not eligible for this trial as this is a study of men with prostate cancer.

3.6 Participant Confidentiality and Authorization Statement  
 
The Coordinating Center, with the approval from the DFCI IRB, will provide a consent template, with 
information regarding authorization for the disclosure of protected health information. Subject confidentiality will 
be maintained except as may be required  by law. All identifying information will be kept in a secure area at all 
times. Consent form(s) will be maintained in a separate folder from original Case Report Forms at the conclusion 
of the study. Only de -identified data will be used for analyses.  
The DF/HCC Sponsor will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information in its trials. However, 
because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health information must be collected. DF/HCC has chosen to 
use authorizations, signed by t he participant in the trial, rather than limited data sets with data use agreements.  
 
3.6.1  DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Confidentiality  
 
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participant are strictly confidential. Whenever 
reason ably feasible, any participant specific reports submitted to the Coordinating Center should be de -identified.

registered.  
 
• It should be noted that subjects referred through BIDMC to BWH will be registered via the BWH 
registration procedures.  
 
 
3.7.2  Initiation of Therapy  
 
Participants must be registered with the DF/HCC ODQ  before  receiving treatment.  Treatment may not be initiated 
until the Participating Institution receives confirmation of the participant’s registration from the Coordinating 
Center. The DF/HCC Sponsor and  DFCI IRB must be notified of any violations to this policy.  
 
3.7.3  Eligibility Exceptions  
 
The DF/HCC ODQ  will make no exceptions to the eligibility requirements for randomized trials .  
 
3.8 DF/HCC Protocol Case Number  
 
At the time of registration, ODQ  requires th e following identifiers for all subjects: initials, date of birth, gender, 
race and ethnicity. Once eligibility has been established and the participant successfully registered, the participant 
is assigned a unique protocol case number.  Participating Inst itutions should submit all de -identified subsequent 
communication and documents to the Coordinating Center, using this case number to identify the subject.   
 
3.8.1 Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and Violations  
 
The site investigators are not allowed to initiat e changes in approved research without IRB review and approval, 
except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participant. Any departure from the defined 
procedures set forth in the IRB approved protocol must be reported to the DF/HC C Sponsor, who in turn is 
responsible for reporting to the DFCI IRB.

DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring that all protoc ol violations/deviations are promptly reported 
per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
 
Participating Institutions : Protocol deviations require prospective approval from the DFCI IRB. The Participating 
Institution must submit the deviation request to the Coordinating Ce nter who will then submit the deviation request 
to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB approval the deviation is submitted to the Participating Institution IRB, per 
institutional policy. A copy of the Participating Institution’s IRB report and determination will b e forwarded to the 
Coordinating Center within 10 business days after the original submission.  
 
All protocol violations must be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner.  
 
Coordinating Center:   Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the Participating Institution, the 
Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC Sponsor for review. Subsequently, the Participating 
Institution’s IRB violation/deviation report will be submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting  
guidelines. DF/HCC will forward all violation reports to CTEP via an internal DF/HCC process, as applicable.  
 
3.9 Safety Assessments and Toxicity Monitoring  
 
The study teams at all participating institutions are responsible for protecting the safety, rights and well -being of 
study participants. Recording and reporting of adverse events that occur during the course of a study help ensure 
the continuing safety of  study participants.  
 
All participants receiving investigational agents and/or other protocol mandated treatment will be evaluated for 
safety. The safety parameters include complete blood counts, blood chemistries, PSA, periodic physical 
examination findi ngs, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported by participants.  All toxicities 
encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the criteria specified in the protocol. Life -threatening 
toxicities must be reported immediately to the DF/ HCC Sponsor via the Coordinating Center.  
 
3.9.1 Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
 
Guidelines for reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are detailed in the Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan (appended to this document) .

5.1 Ongoing Monitoring of Protocol Compliance  
 
The Coordinating Center will implement ongoing monitoring activities to ensure th at Participating Institutions are 
complying with regulatory and protocol requirements, data quality, and participant safety. Monitoring will occur 
during protocol performance and through study completion. Additional monitoring practices may include but are  
not limited to; source verification, review and analysis of the following: eligibility requirements of all participants, 
informed consent procedures, adverse events and all associated documentation, study drug administration/treatment, 
regulatory files, p rotocol departures, pharmacy records, response assessments, and data management.  
Monitoring will occur every 6 months during the first year and then annually.  Additional monitoring may occur at 
the discretion of the DF/HCC Sponsor if incidences of non-compliance are discovered.  
Participating institutions will be required to participate in monthly Coordinating Center initiated teleconferences.  
Source documentation verification (SDV) will be conducted by having access to participants’ complete study 
records and source documents.  
 
5.2 Monitoring Reports

5.3 Accrual Monitoring  
 
Prior to extending a protocol to an external site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish accrual requirements for each 
participating institution. Each site will accrue at least  3  subjects per year. Accrual will be monitored for each 
participating institution by the DF/HCC Sponsor or designee. Sites that are not meeting their accrual expectations 
may be subject to termination.  
 
6. AUDITING: QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
6.1 Audit Plan: NCI Sponsored Trials  
 Not applicable  
 
6.2 Audit Plan: DF/HCC Sponsored Trials  
 
One on -site audit will be scheduled by the ODQ , assuming at least three participants have been treated on protocol 
at the site. Approximately 3 -4 participants would be audited at the site over a 2 day period.  If violations which 
impact participant safety or the integrity of the study are found, more participant records may be audited.  
 
6.3 Audit Notification  
 
It is the Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify the Coordinating Center of all scheduled audit dates 
(internal or NCI) and re -audit dates (if applicable), which involve this protocol.  All institutions will forward a copy

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
1RO1NR014502 -01A1, PI: Bhasin, Shalender  
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for this trial, described below, will be reviewed and approved by 
the NINR staff prior to the commencement of any human subjects activities in this trial. The DSMP approved by 
the NINR staff will then be submitted  to the local IRB for its review and approval. It is understood that the IRB 
approval of the NINR -approved DSMP is required before human subjects activities can take place within the trial, 
and that the awardee institution is responsible for approving the DSMB.  
The responsibility for compliance with the DSMP rests with the PI. The oversight of the monitoring activity 
described in the DSMP is the responsibility of the NINR staff. NINR will be notified within 7 days if the human 
subjects research or DSMP is c hanged prior to or during the implementation of the clinical trial. The NINR 
program staff must approve the changes prior to implementation.   
 
The essential components of the DSM Plan are the following:  
a. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an indepe ndent committee charged with reviewing safety 
and trial progress and providing advice with respect to study continuation, modification, and termination, 
will assume oversight of the study, in accordance with NINR policy, once the study is underway. The 
procedures that will be used for data and safety monitoring are outlined below.  
b. The DSMB will include five individuals,  including a chair and a separate executive secretary. All five 
members will be voting members. The DSMB members will have expertise in pros tate cancer, androgen 
biology, biostatistical analysis of clinical trials data, and the conduct and oversight of clinical trials in 
prostate cancer patients.  These individuals will be approved by the institutional review board for human 
subjects research (IRB) after review of their expertise and potential conflicts of interest. The composition 
of the DSMB will consist of the following:  
• Two nationally or internationally recognized experts in prostate cancer and clinical trials of men with prostate 
cancer  
• An expert with nursing background and experience in symptom management including fatigue and other 
outcomes being assessed in this trial  
• An endocrinologist with expertise in clinical trials of androgens in men  
• A biostatistician with expertise in the design  and analysis of clinical trials  
 
Safety Review Procedures:  
1.) The DSMB will meet to review the safety data every 6 months.   This review will take place by 
teleconference.  A majority must be present at the DSMB meeting to have a quorum.  
2.) Generation of safety reports. The Study’s PI, with the assistance of the Data M anagement Center 
(DMC) will prepare and submit the safety reports for DSMB review, This will be done in a blinded 
fashion, while protecting the confidentiality of participant data.  The reports will be given to an 
independent third party who will add a cod e (A, B, or C) to the data for each treatment group.  The 
third party will place the finished report into an envelope, seal the envelope and sign across the seal.  
NCI Protocol #: Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120 
Protocol Version Date:  09/12 /2018  
 
68 He/she will place this envelope containing the coded safety report into Fed Ex envelopes, pr e-
prepared by the research coordinators, and seal those.  The reports will be sent, by Fed Ex, to the 
various DSMB members.  This will allow the DSMB to review the safety data by individual treatment 
groups.  The third party will store, in a locked cabinet , the code for the trial.  In the event that the 
DSMB requests unblinding of the study, the code will be sent from the third party directly to the 
DSMB. Thus, the DSMB members can have access to the categorized data, while the investigating 
team remains bl inded.  
3.) Review of all adverse events will be performed by treatment group (coded A, B, or C).  
4.) Each safety report will include the enrollment status, including the number of subjects recruited, 
screened, and randomized.  In addition, it will incorporate the  number of dropouts and the reason for 
the dropouts.  The investigating team will comply with NIH, FDA, and institutional policies on 
reporting adverse events.  The report will list all adverse events since the previous reporting period.  
In addition, a cu mulative list of all adverse events will also be provided to the DSMB members. The 
summary of all adverse events will allow for a comprehensive overview or analysis of the events 
rates.  All AE’s will be evaluated for severity and attribution.  In order to  protect participant 
confidentiality, the data provided to the DSMB will be coded so that individual patients cannot be 
identified.  
5.) Each DSMB meeting will be comprised of 2 portions.  Research personnel will arrange and be 
present for the “open discussions ” at the start of the DSMB meetings.  The initial “open” portion of 
the meeting will have study personnel available to give a brief update on the status of the trial and to 
respond to any questions that the DSMB may have.  The second portion of the meeting s will be 
“closed” to study personnel so that DSMB members may have independent deliberations.  Provisions 
will be made for study personnel to be available to the DSMB committee during these deliberations, 
should their input be required.  
6.) In addition to the se review procedures the DSMB will receive copies of all serious adverse events, 
with study group assignment (A or B), as they occur.  
Transmission of DSMB Recommendations and Summary Reports of Adverse Events to IRBs  
A summary of the DSMB review and recom mendations without treatment assignment information will be sent to 
the Principal Investigator after each DSMB meeting.  The PI will then forward the DSMB report, including the 
DSMB’s assessment of adverse events within the trial, to the IRBs of the partic ipating institutions.  
Transmission of Summary of Closed Deliberations to the NINR Staff  
The NINR Program Officer will receive a copy of the “closed” deliberations. This information will be kept in a secure 
file, accessible only to the NINR Program Staff.  
Procedures for monitoring study safety : 
1. Monitoring schedule  
a. Adverse events are solicited and recorded by study staff at each study visit.  
b. PSA is measured at screening and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 12.  
c. Other safety labs – complete blood counts and chemistries – are measured at screening, baseline and 
during weeks 6 and 12.  
2. Auditing of selected cases for compliance with IRB requirements, conformance with informed consent 
requirements, verification of sour ce documents, and investigator compliance will be performed by Brigham 
and Women’s Hospital’s institutional compliance officer annually.  
NCI Protocol #: Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120 
Protocol Version Date:  09/12 /2018  
 
69 3. Procedures for minimizing research -associated risk.  
All subjects will be monitored by frequent physical examinations, blood counts, chemistries and PSA levels. We 
will follow hematocrit , plasma lipids, blood chemistries, PSA and record all adverse events reported by the subjects 
every 4 -weeks.  
The risks of blood drawing will be minimized by having only expe rienced practitioners perform phlebotomy.  
 
The risk of injury from participating in exercise testing will be minimized by several safety measures.  The 
subjects will be instructed in proper technique and the risks minimized by careful supervision.  Patien ts will be screened 
with cardiopulmonary exercise testing with continuous monitoring of the ECG to rule out cardiac ischemia and serious 
arrhythmias.  This test will be  administered and supervised according to current American Heart Association 
guidelines1.  The likelihood of musculoskeletal injury from exercise testing will be minimized by providing a warm -up 
period pr eceding  each exercise session including low speed treadmill walking and  stretching exercises.  Further, a 
certified exercise physiologist will oversee all exercise testing sessions.  
 The risks of SARM therapy will be minimized by close monitoring with serial physical examinations, 
hematocrit, and PSA levels. We have incorporated all the procedures recommended by the Expert Panel of the 
Endocri ne Society on Androgen Deficiency Syndromes, ISSAM, and the American College of Physicians/American 
Society of Internal Medicine Disease Management Module for Male Hypogonadism for monitoring of men receiving an 
androgen. Although these guidelines were dev eloped for testosterone therapy, they are appropriate for following men 
receiving any type of androgen therapy. We have incorporated in this trial several additional measures to minimize risk:  
a. The selection of LY SARM, which not only spares the prostate bu t has been shown in preclinical models to act 
as an androgen antagonist on the prostate, induce prostate atrophy in a canine model, inhibit the growth of 
prostate cancer explants in mice, and lower PSA in men.  
b. The inclusion and exclusion criteria will ass ure selection of subjects at very low risk of disease recurrence.  
c. We have established rigorously defined criteria for biochemical recurrence and for progression from stage 1.  
d. We have established a priori  stopping rules based on PSA change.  
e. We will perform frequent PSA measurements to ensure early detection of biochemical recurrence.  
f. We will designate  study clinicians to monitor PSA and other laboratory tests at each site. 
g. An independent DSMB will oversee the study after its initiation   
Protecting the confidentiality of participant data  
Subject confidentiality will be maintained except as may be required by law. All identifying information will be 
kept in a secure area at all times. Consent form(s) will be maintained in a separate folder from original C ase Report 
Forms at the conclusion of the stud y. Only de -identified data will be used for analyses.  
Procedures for identifying, reviewing, and reporting of adverse events and unanticipated problems to the IRB, 
NINR, and FDA  
The adverse events will be identified by the study staff and reviewed by a study physician on an ongoing basis. Serious 
adverse events will be reported by the study PI to the DSMB Chair, FDA and NINR staff. Unanticipated problems will 
be reported to the DSMB, IRB, FDA, and NINR staf f by the study’s PI.  
Termination Criteria  
The following Termination Criteria  will be used:  
NCI Protocol #: Not Applicable  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15-120 
Protocol Version Date:  09/12 /2018  
 
70 • An increase in PSA to 0.2 ng/mL or higher, if confirmed by a repeated test, will result in treatment 
discontinuation and referral to a urologist.  
• Any evidence of dis ease recurrence will lead to immediate treatment discontinuation.  
• An increase in  hematocrit above 54% , if confirmed by a repeated test,  would warrant discontinuation of treatment.  
• Transaminase elevation above 3 t imes the upper limit of normal , if confirme d by a repeated test, would warrant 
discontinuation of treatment . 
• Myocardial infarction or stroke   
We recognize that other unexpected adverse events can occur. Therefore, we have instituted a comprehensive plan for 
early detection of adverse events; the D ata Safety Monitoring Board will be empowered to discontinue treatment in one 
or more subjects, or halt the study, should the occurrence of adverse events so warrant.  
Procedures ensuring compliance with the monitoring plan and reporting requirements across sites  
As this is a three -site study, a study monitor will visit each of the three  sites to monitor compliance with the study 
protocol, monitoring plan, and reporting requirements. These visits will take place every 6 months in the first  year and 
then annually.  
 
An assessment of external factors or relevant information that may have an impact on safety of the participants 
or on the ethics of the study.  
The study team will provide this assessment to the DSMB (6 -monthly) and IRB (annual) r eports.  
 
Interim or Futility Analysis  
There are no plans for an interim or futility analysis.  
 
Additional Components of the DSM Plan  
The PI will provide reporting to the NINR staff of the following. All personal identifiers will be removed from any 
documents sent to NINR staff.  
1. Unanticipated problems or unexpected serious adverse events that may be related to the study protocol  
2. IRB -approved revisions to the study protocol that indicate a change in risks to the participants  
3. A summary of recom mendations made by the DSMB and if applicable, an action plan for response  
4. Notice of any actions taken by the IRB or regulatory bodies regarding the research and any responses to those 
actions

 To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics  (PD) of RPC1063  
 To assess the safety of RPC1063  
Extension Period  
Primary:  
 To characterize the longer term safety of continued dosing of RPC1063  
Secondary:  
 To characterize endoscopic improvement at Week 52  
 To characterize the histopathological changes of the intestinal mucosa at Week 52  
 To characterize the effect of RPC1063 in maintaining clinical improvem ent over time  
Methodology:  
This is an open label trial comprised of 2 periods – a 12 week Induction Period and an Extension Period 
(148 weeks).  Eligible patients will enter into the trial through the Induction Period and those who complete 
the Induction  Period will have the opportunity to enter into the Extension Period.  
Induction Period:  
Patient eligibility will be determined during a 5 -week Screening Period prior to first dose of investigational 
drug.  All eligible patients will complete a 7 -day dose escalation  regimen consisting of 4 days of treatment 
with RPC1063 /ozanimod HCl  0.25 mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.23 mg) daily followed by 3  days of 
treatment with RPC1063 /ozanimod HCl  0.5 mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0. 46 mg) daily, with the final

 Confidential  5 RPC1063/ozanimod HCl 1 mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.92 mg) daily dose to be reached on Day 8.  Patients 
will then continue on open label at RPC1063 1 mg/day during the Induction Period for 11  weeks.  At Week 
12 patients will be evaluated for endoscopic and  clinical response/remission.  
Patients who complete the Induction Period will have the opportunity to receive continued treatment with 
RPC1063 in the Extension Period.   Investigators should assess patient ’s clinical status at the end of the 
Induction Period and, using clinical judgment, determine if the patient should continue into the Extension 
Period or withdraw from the trial and receive alternative therapy.  
Extension Period:  
All patients will receive RPC1063 1 mg daily dose in the Extension Period and m ay receive treatment 
through Week  160.  During the Extension Period, the investigator should continue to assess the patient ’s 
clinical status and based on clinical judgment determine if the patient should continue or withdraw from the 
trial and receive alt ernative therapy.  
Patients who complete the Week 160 visit may have the option to immediately enter (without completing the 
30-day and 90-day Safety Follow -up Visits)  the open-label extension Phase 3 Crohn’s disease Study 
.

Safety:  
The incidence, severity, relationship and type of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious AEs 
(SAEs), AEs leading to discontinuation of investigational drug, and AEs of special interest, and clinically 
meaningful changes from baseline on clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, ECG, and physical 
examinations will be assessed.  
The safety of patients will be monitored by  collection of treatment -emergent AEs, serious adverse events 
(SAEs), physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECG results, optical coherence tomography (OCT), 
pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and clinical laboratory tests.  Patients who discontinue  from treatment due 
to lack of response, AEs, or other reasons, even if alternative treatment is given, will complete an Early 
Termination Visit and will be followed for 90 days for collection of safety data and for the assessment of 
their disease status.  
Statistical Methods: 
Induction and Extension Period Efficacy  
This is an open -label, single -arm trial.  As such, there are no hypothesis tests on the data collected in this 
trial.  In general, descriptive summaries will be presented for the efficacy and sa fety variables collected.  
Continuous variables will be summarized using number of patients (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and 
percentages.  
Safety  
All treatment-emergent AEs will be coded and tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.  Adverse 
events will be monitored during the trial and the data analyzed with respect to incidence as well as severity 
and potential relationship of the AEs to investi gational drug.  The incidence of AEs, SAEs, AEs of special

 Confidential  11 interest, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be summarized and presented in descending order of 
frequency.  Associated laboratory parameters such as hepatic enzymes, renal function, and hemato logy 
values will be grouped and presented together.  Individual patient values will be listed and values outside of 
the standard reference range will be flagged.  Shift tables and analyses of changes from baseline will be 
produced.  The change from baselin e for each of the vital signs and ECG parameters will be summarized.  
The incidence of abnormal vital signs parameters and outlier ECG results will be tabulated.  
Sample Size Justification  
The sample size of 60 patients has been chosen to enable estimates o f response and remission rates with 
reasonable precision.  Assuming a remission rate of 15% and a response rate of 30%, it is estimated that the 
confidence interval (half -widths of the 95% CI) around the proportion of patients in response and remission 
will be 12.8% and 16.4% for 30 patients and 9.0% and 11.6% for 60 patients.

7.1. Overall Trial Design 
This Phase 2, multi -center, open-label trial, to be conducted in North  America and Europe, is 
designed to assess the endoscopic improvement , clinical response/remission,  and changes in 
intestinal and blood biomarkers in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease 
receiving RPC1063 as induction therapy.  The trial comprises 2 periods: Induction (1 2 weeks) 
and Extension ( 148 weeks).  Patients will be entered into the trial through the Induction Period.  
A central reader will calculate the SES -CD for eligibility and assessment of the primary e ndpoint 
to ensure objectivity.  
The safety of patients will be monitored by collection of treatment -emergent AEs, serious 
adverse events (SAEs), physical exam inations, vital sign  measurements , ECG results, optical 
coherence  tomography (OCT), pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and clinical laboratory tests . 
Patients who discontinue from treatment due to lack of response, AEs, or other reasons, even if 
alternative treatment is given, will complete an Early Termination Visit and will be followed for 
90 days for collection of safet y data and for the assessment of their disease status.  
7.1.1. Induction Period  
The trial will enroll approximately 60 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease.  Patient eligibility will be determined during a 5 -week Screening Period.  All patie nts 
who meet eligibility criteria and enter into the trial will complete a 7 -day dose escalation  
regimen consisting of 4 days of treatment with RPC1063 /ozanimod HCl  0.25 mg (equivalent to 
ozanimod 0.23 mg ) daily followed by 3 days treatment with RPC1063 /ozanimod HCl  0.5 mg 
(equivalent to  ozanimod 0.46 mg ) daily (administered as two 0.25 mg capsules), with the final 
dose level of RPC1063 /ozanimod HCl  1 mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.92 mg ) daily dose to be 
reached on Day 8.  Patients will then continue on R PC1063 1 mg daily during the Induction 
Period for 11 weeks. At Week 12 patients will be evaluated for endoscopic and clinical 
response/remission.   
Patients who complete the Induction Period will have the opportunity to receive continued 
treatment with RPC 1063 in the Extension Period.   Investigator s should assess patient ’s clinical 
status at the end of the Induction Period and, using clinical judgment , determine if the patient 
should continue into the Extension Period or withdraw from the trial and receive alternative 
therapy. 
Induction Period visit schedule and procedures, including early termination and safety follow -up, 
are provided in Table 2.   
7.1.2. Extension Period  
All patients will receive RPC1063 1 mg daily dose in the Extension Period and may receive 
treatment through Week 1 60.   During the E xtension Period, the investigator should continue to 
assess the patients clinical status and based on clini cal judgment determine if the patient should 
continue or withdraw from the trial and receive alternative therapy.   Extension Period visit 
schedule and procedures, including early termination and safety follow -up, are provided in 
Table 3.

 Confidential  27 Patients who complete the Week 160 visit may have the option to immediately enter (without 
completing the 30 -day or 90-day Safety Follow -up Visits) the open-label extension Phase 3 CD 
Study . 
7.2. Criteria for Trial Termination  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the trial prematurely for safety reasons.  In addition, the 
Sponsor may terminate the trial prematurely for administrative reasons.  In all cases, all 
necessary measures must be taken to guarantee appropriate safety follow -up of all patients 
already included in the trial.  
The IEC or IRB and the Regulatory Authorities will be informed in writing about any premature 
termination of the trial.  
7.3. Schedule  of Events  
The visit schedule and procedures for the Induction Period and Extension  Period are provided in

b  Trial visits should be scheduled in the morning, where possible, and on trial visit days patients should be instructed to withhold the dose until the trial visit .  T he dose should be 
administered during the visit.  
c  Patients should continue taking investigati onal drug while it is being determined if they qualify for the Extension Period.  Those who do not qualify should return for their Early 
Term Visit as soon as is practical but no later than 4 weeks after their Week 12 visit.  
d  Medical history will include  smoking and Crohn’s disease history .  Day 1 medical history can be abbreviated, noting events that occurred between Screening and Day 1. 
e  Active TB must be ruled out according to local medical practices.   
f  Serology testing will be performed at Screening to determine the patient's immune status with respect to the following viruses: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, 
anti-hepatitis A virus IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti -hepatitis B core  antigen (HBcAg) IgM, anti -hepatitis C virus (HCV) IgG or IgM.  In addition, patients 
must have documentation of positive Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) IgG antibody status or complete VZV vaccination at least 30 days prior to first dose of investigational drug. 
g  At Screening the stool sample will be used to rule out serious infection and should include evaluation for C. difficile toxin  as well as ova and parasitic examination.  
h   During Screening the CDAI clinical score, SES -CD and colonoscopy must be co mpleted within 14 days of Day 1.  Patients should also begin completing the CDAI patient diary 
during this time.  At Screening, patients will be issued a CDAI diary and will be trained in the completion of the diary.  
i  Week 12 colonoscopy should be perform ed either on day of visit or no more than 7 days prior to the visit date.  
j  Colonoscopy does not need to be performed at the Early Term visit if one was completed within 8 weeks of the Early Term visit . 
k  Enterocutaneous and perianal fistula drainage ass essment will only be performed on patients with fistulas at baseline.  
l  Blood samples for PK evaluation are to be taken up to 15 -30 minutes prior to investigational drug administration (pre-dose) and just prior to discharge from the clinic (6 -8 hours 
post-dose) on Day 1.  Blood samples at subsequent visits will be trough level , taken just prior to investigational drug administration. The actual time of investigational drug 
administration for all visits with PK evaluation will be recorded.  The blood sample at the 30-day and 90-day Safety Follow-Up Visit can be collected at any point during the 
visit.  An additional PK sample will be obtained for patients  with any AE resulting in discontinuation or SAE.  
m  Week 12 flow cytometry analysis will only be performed for patients with a baseline sample  (Day 1). 
n  Prior to first dose of investigational drug , a 12-lead ECG will be performed. After the dose, patients will have hourly vital signs recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  and 6 hours post -dose.  
A second 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the end of the observation period.  
o  For females of childbearing potential only, serum beta hCG is required at screening and a urine beta hCG is required at each visit.  Between scheduled visits  up until the 90-day 
Safety Follow -up Visit, monthly urine pregnancy tests should be performed by the patient.  If a urine pregnancy test result is positive, the investigator will instruct the patient to 
suspend further RPC1063 dosing , if applicable,  and schedule a follow -up appointment as soon as possible.  A serum pregnancy test will be performed for confirmation, including 
after the 90-day Safety Follow -up Visit, if needed.  Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be conducted for female subjects of 
childbearing potential. The Investigator will educate all FCBP about the different options of contraceptive methods or abstin ence as appropriate.  The subject will be re -educated 
every time her contraceptive measures/methods or ability to become pregnant changes. The female subject’s chosen form of cont raception must be effective by the time the 
female subject is randomized into the study (for examp le, hormonal contraception should be initiated at least 28 days before randomization).  
p  The screening physical examination (PE) includes height  and weight , other visits include weight .  A complete PE will be performed at Screening and end of trial visit (Week 12 
or Early Term) .  The complete PE will include a full examination of the skin for lesions as well as a check for visual symptoms (i.e., blurred vision or decre ased visual acuity).  
An interim PE may be performed at all other visits.  The interim PE  will include areas with previously -noted abnormalities and those associated with any new complaints from 
the patient.  The interim PE will also include a check for visual symptoms (i.e., blurred vision or decreased visual acuity).  
q  DLCO, if locally avai lable, will be done at Screening  and Early Term. 
r The 90-day Safety Follow-up Visit should be conducted as a clinic visit.  However, if the patient is not available for a clinic visit, a telephone call fo llow-up should be performed 
(with at least 3 attempts within the visit window) to record the pregnancy test result, concomitant medications, and AEs, including informatio n regarding relationship of AE s to 
RPC1063.  
s  If ALC is confirmed < 200 cells/μL, the Investigator will temporarily discontinue in vestigational drug. Laboratory testing will be repeated weekly until ALC is > 500 cells/µL.  
For patients whose ALC level is confirmed < 200  cells/μL and has not reached the acceptable range (ALC >  500 cells/µL) during the study, laboratory testing will be repeated at 
the 90-day Safety Follow -up Visit.

appropriate, a patient may be discontinued from the trial for failure to comply with 
dosing regimen as specified  by the protocol  
 Non-compliance with protocol/protocol deviation:  A patient fails to follow protocol 
procedures, or other event or decision that stands in contrast to the  guidelines set in 
the protocol  
 Adverse event:  A patient must be discontinued from investigational  drug if, in the 
judgment of the Investigator or if specified in the protocol, the patient develops an 
AE such as an intercurrent illness or complication that justifies discontinuation of 
investigational  drug 
 Lack of efficacy: Decision by the  patient and/or the Investigator to discontinue 
treatment due to a lack of expected or desi red effect related to a therapy  
 Withdrawal by Patient:  The patient may choose to discontinue investigational  drug at 
any time.  Every effort should be made within t he bounds of safety and patient choice 
to have each patient complete the Early Termination Visit  and 30-day and 90-day 
Safety Follow -up Visits.  If a patient withdraws consent, the only additional trial data 
to be collected will be the follow -up of SAEs as mandated by the protocol  
 Pregnancy: If the patient becomes pregnant investigational  drug must be discontinued 
(see Section 12.2.11 ) 
 Trial termination by Sponsor  
 Other 
All patients who discontinue the trial should complete an Early Termination Visit (see  Table 2 
and Table 3).  For subjects who hav e a confirmed ALC below the 200  cells/μL limit and 
permanently discontin ue from participation in the study, central laboratory testing will continue 
every 14 days (± 3 days) after the Early Termination Visit until it is above the lower limit of 
normal.  With the exception of patients who withdraw consent or are lost to follow -up, patients 
should complete the 30-day and 90-day Safety Follow-up Visits for the collection of safety data 
and to assess their disease status.  Alternative treatment for CD can be started, if needed, after the 
Early Termination Visit. 
The reason for discontinuation of investigational  drug will be recorded in the clinical records and 
the patient’s eCRF.  For those patients whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for trial 
visits without stating an intention to discontinue trial participation, the Investigator should

The Investigator must ensure that the investigational drug  will be used only in accordance with 
the protocol.   Investigational drug  should not be used for purposes other than as defined in this 
protocol.

9.1.1. Instructions for Missed Dose(s) of RPC1063 Capsules  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.1.2. Induction Period  
Patients will receive RPC1063 1 mg oral capsule daily fo r 11 weeks after the 7 -day dose 
escalation  (12 weeks total duration).  
9.1.3. Extension Period  
All patients will receive RPC1063 1 mg capsule or ally once daily for 148 weeks. 
9.2. Selection of Dose in the Trial 
The selected dose of 1 mg /day of RPC1063 is primarily based on the results from the Phase  2 
dose finding induction trial in UC (RPC01 -202).  The 1 mg/day dose demonstrated better 
efficacy than the 0.5 mg/day dose across various clinical and endoscopic endpoints.   
Furthermore, the expected magnitude of pharmacody namics effect on peripheral lymphocyte 
reduction and an acceptable safety profile was observed.  
A dose escalation  over the first 7 days (0.25 mg/day on Days 1 to 4 and 0.5 mg/day 
[administered as tw o 0.25 mg capsules] on D ays 5 to 7) will be implemented , as results from 
RPCS 001 and preliminary results from RPC01 -202 indicate that use of a dose escalation  

Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  43 regimen mitigates the magnitude of reduction in HR.  Preliminary evidence from these trials 
suggest that patients who  increase their dose progressively over the first week are less likely to 
have a clinically meaningful  decrease in HR or blood pressure; therefore, a dose escalation  
starting with 0.25 mg RPC1063 for the first 4 days of dosing followed by 0.5  mg (administered 
as two 0.25 mg capsules)  on Days 5 through 7 before progressing to the 1  mg/day dose will be 
used. 
9.3. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
Not applicable.  
9.4. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
Patients will self -administer RPC1063 orally once -daily.  Investigational dru g should be taken at 
approximately the same time each day  with or without food . 
9.5. Prior and Concomitant Treatments  
All treatments , other than RPC1063,  being taken by the patients on entry into the trial or at any 
time during the trial  including through the 90-day Safety Follow -up Visit, are regarded as 
concomitant medications and must be documented on the appropriate section of the eCRF.  A 
history of all prior medications needs to be documented to at least 4 weeks prior to trial 
participation.  A history of previous treatments for CD needs to be documented.  
Patients who are receiving oral 5 -ASA, oral corticosteroids, or purified medicinal probiotics at 
screening must keep their prescribed dosage steady through Week 8 and can only be 
discontinued or reduced in  dose if Investigator judgment requires it because of toxicity or 
medical necessity.   After Week 8 these medications can be discontinued or reduced as medically 
indicated.   Oral 5-ASA, oral corticosteroids, or purified medicinal probiotics should not be 
started during the first 12 weeks of the study in patients who were not receiving them  during 
screening.  Ideally, patients receiving 5 -ASA or purified medicinal probiotics should maintain a 
stable dose throughout the trial.  Patients not receiving oral 5 -ASA, oral corticosteroids, or 
purified medicinal probiotics at screening can only begin dosing with these medications if 
Investigator judgment requires it because of medical necessity.  
9.5.1. Steroid Taper  
During the Induction Phase, patients are to maintain their stable baseline corticosteroid dose, if 
applicable.  
Corticosteroids may be tapered starting from Week 12 for patients entering the Extension Period .  
Patients receiving prednisone at a dose of > 10 mg/day (or equivalent) may have their dose 
reduced at a rate of 5 mg per week until a 10 mg/day dose is achieved.  Patients receiving 
prednisone at doses of ≤ 10 mg/day (or equivalent), or once a 10 mg/day dose (or equivalent) is 
achieved by tapering, may have their dose reduced at  a rate of 2.5  mg/week until discontinuation.  
Beginning at Week 12, patients receiving budesonide may taper their dose at a rate of 3  mg every 
3 weeks.  For patients who do not tolerate a corticosteroid taper without recurrence of clinical 
symptoms of eit her CD or steroid withdrawal,  the corticosteroid dose may be increased (up to the 
dose at trial entry if required), but tapering may be tried again.

 Confidential  44 9.5.2. Allowed Medications  
All prior medications (including over -the-counter medications) administered 30 days pri or to the 
first dose of investigational drug  and any concomitant therapy administered to the patient during 
the course of the trial (starting at the date of informed consent) until 90 days after the final dose 
of investigational drug  will be recorded.  Add itionally, all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical 
procedures and/or past biologic exposure relating to CD should be recorded.  Any medication 
that is considered necessary for the patient’s health and that is not expected to interfere with the 
evaluation of or interact with investigational drug  may be continued during the trial 
(see Table 4). 
Administration of concomitant medications must be reported in  the appropriate section of the 
eCRF along with dosage information, dates of administration, and reasons for use.  For 
medications with a single active ingredient, generic names for concomitant medication should be 
used if possible.  For combination products, brand names should be used.  The total daily dose 
should be filled in whenever possible.

will return to the care of their personal physician(s).  
9.7. Treatment Compliance  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that patients are correctly instructed on how to 
take their investigational drug  and that each patient is fu lly compliant with their assigned dosage 
regimen.  Records of investigational drug  used and intervals between visits will be kept during 
the trial.  Drug accountability will be noted by the Clinical Monitor  during site visits and at the 
completion of the trial.  Patients will be asked to return all unused medication at the end of the

 Confidential  46 trial.  The investigational drug should be dispensed by the Investigator, or by a qualified 
individual under the Investigator’s supervision.  An up-to-date treatment inventory/ dispensing 
record must be maintained as described in  Section 10.3.  
Overall trial non -compliance is defined as taking less than 80% or more than 120%  of 
investigational drug during the entire treatment period.  
At each visit, previously dispensed investigational drug capsules will be collected by the 
Investigator , or by a qualified individual under the Investigator’s supervision , and compliance 
assessed.  Patients exhibiting poor compliance as assessed by medication counts (i.e., 2 or more 
missed medication days in 1 week) and their response to a medication compliance question at 
each visit should be counseled on the importance of good compliance to the trial dosing regimen.  
Patients who are persistently non -compliant (<80% or >120%) should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor to determine whether they should be withdrawn from the trial.

10.2. Packaging and Labeling  
RPC1063 capsules will be packaged in 30 cc white high -density polyethylene bottles 
(35 capsules per bottle, apart from the dose escalation  kits), closed with a 28 mm  child resistant 
screw-cap that is induction sealed.   The labeling of investigational drug will be in accordance 
with GCP and any other local regulatory requirements.  
10.3. Investigational Drug Accountability  
Investigational drug  should not be used for purposes other than as defined in this protocol.  
All supplies of investigational drug will be accounted for in accordance with GCP.  There will 
be an individual investigational drug accountability record for each patient and the Investigator 
should maintain accurat e records of the disposition of all investigational drug supplies received 
during the trial.  These records should include the amounts and dates clinical drug supplies were 
received, dispensed to the patient, returned by the patient and returned to the Spo nsor.  If errors 
or damages in the clinical drug supply shipments occur, the Investigator should contact the 
Clinical Monitor immediately.  Each Investigator will provide copies of the investigational drug 
accountability records for inclusion in the Trial Master File after database lock.  The Clinical 
Monitor will periodically check the supplies of investigational drug held by the Investigator or 
pharmacist to verify accountability of all investigational drug used.  
The Investigator will provide the investigational drug  only to the identified patients of this trial, 
according to the procedures described in this trial protocol.  After the end of the trial, the Clinical 
Monitor will perform final accountability, package, seal, and prepare for shipment.  
Investigational drug and all medication containers will be returned to the clinical supply 
distribution vendor and documentation will be returned to the CRO.  The CRO will verify that a 
final report of investigational drug  accountability is prepared and maintaine d in the Investigator’s 
Trial Center File.

PHARMACODYNAMICS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments  
The SES-CD will be used to evaluate the primary efficacy endpoint.  
11.1.2. SES-CD 
The simple endoscopy score  (SES-CD) assess es the degree of inflammation.  The SES -CD 
assesses the following 4 components:  size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface , and 
presence of narrowing .  Each of these components are scored on a scale of 0 to 3 as outlined in  
Table 5. 
In the SES -CD, each of these 4 components are assessed in the five segments of the ileum and 
colon:  ileum, right, transverse, left (descen ding and si gmoid), and rectum.  The SES-CD is the 
sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the five segments.   Mild CD is 
defined as an SES-CD ≥3 but less than 7 points.  Moderate to severely active CD is defined as 
an SES-CD of ≥7 points.  
To ensure quality data and standardization, the same endoscopist should be used throughout the 
trial wherever possible.  Colonoscopies will be read at a centralized reading facility.  Each 
patient who enters  into the trial will have c olonic biopsies obtained du ring colonoscopy (see 
Table 2 and Table 3).  Details regarding the biopsies are provided in the biopsy manual.

11.1.3. Crohn’s Disease Activity Index  
The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite score that is used to measure the 
clinical activity of Crohn’s disease.  The CDAI uses a question naire with responses scored 
numerically and weighted .  Scores range from 0 to approximately 600, with higher scores 
indicating greater di sease activity .  The 8 components used to assess the CDAI and their 
weighting factors are noted in  Table 6.  The definitions of mild, moderate, and severe Crohn’s 
disease are provided in Table 7.

 Confidential  49 Patient-reported outcomes (stool frequency and abdominal pain components of the CDAI Score  
and general well -being), and the other CDAI components will be collected in an electronic diary.  
Patients will complete the stool frequency , abdominal pain and general well -being components 
of the CDAI from the patient’s first screening visit and will continue throughout the trial.  
Patients will be instructed on the use and completion of questions on the electronic diary.  
The diary entries will be reviewed by site personnel during screening (prior to dosing, if 
applicable) and during all trial visits.  The stool frequency and abdominal pain diary entries 
preceding each trial visit will be used to calculate the CDAI score and will be calculated using 
the stool freque ncy and the abdominal pain data from the most recent 7 day period, or at least 
3 days within that 7 day period, prior to the visit, excluding the following:  
 One day prior to the start of a procedure or preparation for a procedure that would 
affect stool fr equency  
 The day(s) of a procedure o r preparation for a procedure that would affect stool  
frequency  
Because the colonoscopy preparations can interfere with the assessment of other clinical 
parameters, diary entries used to calculate the CDAI score will not correspond to day(s) of 
bowel preparation or e ndoscopy.

 Confidential  52 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence, severity, relationship and type of AEs, SAEs, AEs 
leading to discontinuation of investigational drug , and AEs of special  interest; and clinically 
meaningful changes from baseline in clinical laboratory test results , vital signs, ECGs, and 
physical examinations . 
12.1.1. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will include evaluation of heart, lung, head and neck, 
abdomen, skin, and extremities.  All significant findings that are present at baseline must be 
reported on the relevant medical history/current medical conditions eCRF.  Significant findings 
made after enrollment  that meet the definition of an AE must be recorde d on the AEs eCRF . 
12.1.2. Vital Signs  
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse will be assessed in a sitting position .  An 
automated validated device may be used, if available. In case the cuff sizes available are not 
large enough for the patient's arm circumference, a sphygmomanometer with an appropriately 
sized cuff may be used.  
Patients will be carefully monitored after the first dose of investigational drug with a 6 -hour 
post-dose monitoring period of hourly recording of pulse and blood pressure  as described in 
Section 12.1.9. 
12.1.3. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead digital ECG devices will be provided to each clinical site by the central ECG 
laboratory f or the duration of the trial.  Detailed instructions describing the process for recording 
and transmission of the digital ECGs will be outlined in the trial-specific manual and provided to 
the site before the start of the trial.  Paper versions of ECG trac ings recorded at the times 
specified in the schedule of assessments  (Section 7.3, Table 2, and Table 3) will be printed and 
photocopied to preserve the ink if necessary, and ke pt at the site as source documentation.  
ECG will be performed after the patient has been resting quietly in a supine position.  The 
screening ECG report from the central reader must be available to confirm patient eligibility 
before enrollment .  Electrocar diograms will be performed on Day 1 for all patients while in the 
clinic before the first dose of investigational drug  administration and after the 6 -hour post -dose 
vital signs assessment .  The 6-hour post -dose ECG will be evaluated by the treating physician, 
with input if needed from a local cardiologist or a central reader to confirm if extended 
monitoring is required.  Additional ECG monitoring will be performed on Days 5 and 8 if 
cardiac issues are identified on the prior day of dose escalation, as desc ribed in Section 12.1.9. 
Only clinically significant abnormalities should be reported in the medical history/current 
medical conditions or adverse event CRF.  Clinically significant findings must be discussed with 
the Medical Monitor before enrolling the patient in the trial.

An OCT will be performed as scheduled in Table 2 and Table 3.  If there is a suspicion of new 
onset or worsening macular edema, then general retinal exam inations, including eye history, 
visual acuity, and dilated  ophthalmoscopy will be obtained.  A general ophthalmologist can do 
the examination, although a retinal specialist would be preferred to do the exam inations 
wherever possible.  
12.1.5. Pulmonary Function Tests  
Pulmonary function tests including forced expiratory vo lume in one second (FEV 1) and forced 
vital capacity (FVC) will be performed as scheduled in Table 2 and Table 3.  In addition, 
diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) measurements will be performed where locally 
available.  DLCO will not be required at sites where there is no local testing facilit y.  These tests 
will be performed at a qualified pulmonary function laboratory or respiratory department.  Refer 
to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines for standardization of 
spirometry and single breath determination of c arbon monoxide uptake in the lung 
(MacIntyre  2005; Miller 2005a ; Miller 2005b ). 
12.1.6. Height and Weight  
Height will be measured at Screening only ; weight will be measured at each v isit. 
12.1.7. Monitoring of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Throughout the course of the trial, every effort must be made to remain alert to possible AEs or 
SAEs.  Refer to Section 12.2 for definitions of AEs/SAEs, monitoring and reporting.   Refer to 
Section 12.2.7 for AEs of special interest.   
12.1.8. Monitoring of Concomitant Therapy  
The use of concomitant medication and procedures will be monitored throughout the trial.  
Refer to Section 9.5.3  for prohibited concomitant therapies.  
12.1.9. Guidelines for Monitoring Patients Taking Their First Dose of RPC1063  
On Day 1 of treatment for Induction, careful cardiac monitoring of the patients is required.  
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring the patient following the first intake of the 
investigational drug, as well as managing bradycardia symptoms should they occur.  The 
Investigator must review the baseline pre -dose ECG, pulse, and blood pressure during the 6 -hour 
monitoring period, post -dose ECG, and assess discharge status at the time specified in Table 2.  
Baseline pre -dose ECG should be provided by the site an d be available for comparison to the 
post-dose ECG in order to determine if criteria requiring extended monitoring are met.  
Resting pulse and blood pressure in the sitting position will be measured at the times specified in 
Table 2 (by the Investigator, an assisting nurse, or other medically qualified staff member).  
When obtaining the pulse and blood pressure before the first dose, the patient should be  allowed 
to rest in a seated position at least 10 minutes before taking measurements.  The pulse and sitting 
blood pressure measurements should be repeated 2 additional times (before the first dose of 
investigational drug only).  The lowest pre -dose value of sitting pulse and blood pressure (based 
on systolic blood pressure) will be recorded in the case report form and serve as baseline for 
Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  54 comparison to post -dose values.   The repeat measurements will be made at approximately 
2-minute intervals.  For the ho urly measurements after investigational drug administration, pulse 
and sitting blood pressure will be measured once and recorded in the eCRF.  
Patients should receive the first dose of investigational drug with or without food  before 
12:00 pm (noon) in the clinic, if possible .  The first dose of investigational drug must be 
administered in a setting in which resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia 
are available.  A  member of the Investigator team should be available to monitor the patient f or 
the 6-hour monitoring period and will need to report any abnormalities to the Investigator.  
Atropine and epinephrine or isoproterenol need to be readily available to the site personnel.  
If any of the following criteria are met, additional extended moni toring (described below) should 
be instituted until the finding has resolved.  Baseline and hourly vital signs measurements 
(Hours 1 through 6) should be used to assess pulse (criteria 1 and 2 below) and ECG should be 
used to assess for AV block and QTcF i nterval (criteria 3 and 4 below).  
1. The pulse 6 hours post -dose is < 45 bpm  
2. The pulse 6 hours post -dose is at the lowest value post -dose (suggesting that the 
maximum PD effect on the heart may not yet have occurred)  
3. The ECG 6 hours post -dose shows new onset  second degree or higher AV block  
4. The ECG 6 hours post -dose shows a prolonged QTcF interval (> 450 msec for males, 
> 470 msec for females)  
Should post -dose symptomatic bradycardia occur, the treating physician should be notified and 
he or she should initia te appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and 
continue observation until the symptoms have resolved.  
Should a patient require pharmacologic intervention for symptomatic bradycardia, continuous 
overnight ECG monitoring in a medical facili ty should be instituted, and the first dose 
monitoring strategy should be repeated the following day (Day 2).  The first dose monitoring 
strategy should also be repeated at the times specified in Table 2 at Day 5 or Day 8 if any cardiac 
safety issues were observed on the previous Day of dose escalation (see Table 2). 
Patients should have written instruction on when to return to the clinic and a 24 -hour contact 
phone number to call in the event of any new or warranted symptoms (eg, chest pain, dizziness,  
palpitations, syncope, nausea, vomiting).  Patients should be instructed not to drive on the same 
day after the first dose of investigational drug administration.  
12.1.10. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
The central laboratory will analyze the samples.  Further de tails of the procedures to be followed 
for sample collection, storage, and shipment will be documented in a laboratory manual.  
Additional and repeat laboratory safety testing may be performed at the discretion of the 
Investigator.

 Confidential  55  Hematology - RBC count, total and differential WBC count (basophils, eosinophils, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils), platelet count, mean platelet volume, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume , mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 
and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentr ation.  Total WBC and all differential 
WBC counts will be provided to the site in this open -label trial.   
During the treatment period, WBC differential results will be available to the 
Investigator.  Reductions in ALC levels is a known pharmacodynamic effect of 
RPC1063.  If any of the following results are observed, the Investigator will be asked 
to repeat the laboratory tests  within approximately 7 days : 
 Absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1000 cells/µL  
 Absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] < 200 cells/µL  
If the ANC is confirmed below the acceptable limits, the Investigator will be 
requested to closely monitor for risk of serious infection and institute appropriate 
follow-up, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
If the ALC is confirmed below the 200 cells/µL, the Investigator will temporarily 
discontinue investigational  drug and then consult with the Medical Monitor . 
Laboratory testing will be repeated weekly until ALC is > 500 cells/µL . 
When ALC has returned to > 500 cells/µL , treatment may be reinitated at 
Investigator ’s discretion ( Section 9.1.1 for instructions on resuming treatment after 
missing doses) .  For patients whose ALC level is confirmed <  200 cells/μL and has 
not reached the acceptable range (ALC > 500 cells/µL) during the  study, laboratory 
testing will be repeated at the 90-day Safety Follow -up Visit.

childbearing potential; urine beta hCG will be performed in  women of childbearing 
potential at each scheduled visit. Between scheduled visits  up until the 90-day Safety 
Follow-up Visit, monthly home urine pregnancy tests should be performed by the 
patient.  If a urine pregnancy test result is positive, the investi gator will instruct the 
patient to suspend further RPC1063 dosing, if applicable, and schedule a follow -up 
appointment as soon as possible.  A serum pregnancy test will be performed for 
confirmation, including after the 90-day Safety Follow -up Visit, if ne eded. 
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the investigational treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or 
unintended sign, (including an abnormal laboratory finding,), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not cons idered related 
to the investigational medicinal product (ICH E2A, II.A.1).  
AEs will be monitored throughout the entire trial  including the 90-day Safety Follow -up Visit.  
Investigators will ask the patient at each visit if they have experienced any untoward occurrence 
since the last trial visit.  All AEs will be recorded on the eCRFs provided: a description of the 
event, severity, time of occurrence, duration, any action (e.g. treatment and follow up tests) and 
the outcome should be provided along wi th the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship to 
the investigational drug.  
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
An Adverse Drug Rea ction (ADR) is defined as all noxious and unintended responses to a 
medicinal product related to any dose (ICH E2A, II.A.2).   
An Unexpected ADR is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product informatio n (ICH E2A, II.A.3).  
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness and causal relationship to the 
investigational drug.  The action taken and the outcome must also be recorded.  
12.2.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of Serious Adv erse Event (SAE):   An SAE (experience) or reaction is any untoward 
medical occurrence that at any dose (ICH E2A, II.B):  
 Results in death  
 Is life-threatening  
Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  57 NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the  
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity, or  
 Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not  be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should 
also usually be considered serious.  
Examples of  such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
In case of a fatality, the cause of deat h is considered as the SAE, and the death is considered as 
its OUTCOME.  
12.2.3. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity  
The severity of the AE will be characterized as “mild, moderate, or severe” according to the 
following definitions:  
 Mild events are usually transie nt and do not interfere with the patient’s daily 
activities.  
 Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and 
may interfere with daily activities.  
 Severe events are incapacitating and interrupt the patient’s usual daily activity. 
12.2.4. Assessment of Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Drug  
The causal relationship between the investigational drug and the AE has to be characterized as 
unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or related.  This medical assessment should b e made as 
soon as feasible when reporting an SAE.  
The Investigator is requested to assess the relationship of any AEs to treatment using the 
following definitions:  
Unrelated:  those AEs which are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes 
(concurrent drugs, environment, etc) and do not meet the criteria for drug relationship listed 
under Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Related.  
Unlikely:  An AE may be considered unlikely if it includes at least the first two features:  
 It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug  
 It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient  
Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  58  It does not follo w a known pattern to the suspected drug  
 It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered  
Possible: An AE may be considered possible if it includes at least the first two features:  
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administrati on of the drug  
 It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environment or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient  
 It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug  
Probable: An AE may be consid ered probable if it includes at least the first three features:  
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug  
 It could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental or to xic factors or other modes of therapy administered 
to the patient  
 It disappears or decreased on cessation or reduction in dose.  There are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug (eg, bone marrow 
depression, fixed drug eru ptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc)  
 It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug  
Related: An AE may be considered related if it includes all of the following features:  
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug  
 It could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered 
to the patient  
 It disappears or decreased on cessation or reduction in dose.  There are exceptions 
when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug (eg, bone marrow 
depression, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc .) 
 It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug  
 It reappears or worsens if the drug is re -administered  
All efforts should be made to classify the AE according to the above categories.  
After initiation of investigational drug, all AEs, regardless of relationship to investigational drug, 
will be recorded until the patient completes his or her last trial visit.  
12.2.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Reporting requirements for SAEs will be managed on behalf of the Sponsor  by the CRO.  Full 
details of the procedures to be adopted will be documented in a safety management plan 
approved by responsible parti es, in brief:  
The Investigator will report any SAE that occurs to any patient from the time written informed 
consent is signed through the last visit.  All SAEs that occur within 90 days of the last dose of 
treatment with the investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the investigational 
Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  59 product, must also be reported.  Any SAE that is ongoing when the patient completes the trial or 
discontinues from the trial will be followed by the Investigator until the event has resolved, 
stabilized, or returned to Baseline status.  
Any AE considered serious by the Investigator or Sub -investigator or that meets serious criteria 
should be reported to the CRO’s Pharmacovigilance group using the designated SAE reporting 
forms and procedures within 24 hours fr om the time the trial site personnel first learned of the 
event.  
The SAE hotline numbers are as follows:  
 
 
 
The initial report should be promptly followed by detailed, written reports, which will include 
copies of hospital case records, discharge summaries, autopsy reports and other documents when 
requested and applicable.  For unrelated cases, a full detailed case description may negate the 
need for additional hospital case records, discharge summaries etc.  
12.2.6. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and 
Investigators  
Investigators will be notified by the CRO of all SAEs that require prompt submiss ion to their 
IRB or IEC.  Investigators should provide written documentation of IRB/IEC notification for 
each report to the CRO.  The CRO will ensure that all SAEs are reported to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities.   Reporting of SAEs must comply with ICH E6, 4.11.1.  
12.2.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events (AEs) of special interest include bradycardia, heart conduction abnormalities 
(2nd degree and higher AV block), macular edema, malignancy, serious or opportunistic 
infection, pulmonary effects, and hepatic effects.  
Special considerations regarding monitoring for these events are as follows:  
 Bradycardia and heart conduction abnormalities (eg, symptomatic bradycardia, 
2nd degree AV block, QT prolongation):  
- Patients will be closely monitore d in the clinic after their first dose of the initial 
dose escalation  regimen for a period of 6 hours after treatment.  
Electrocardiograms will occur pre -dose and at Hour 6 following dosing, with 
more frequent assessments if clinically indicated.  Resting pulse and blood 
pressure in the sitting position will be assessed pre-dose and then hourly for 6 
hours following dosing.   See the monitoring guidelines in Section 12.1.9 for 
further details.  
- Investigators should be particularly mindful of patients who have a pulse rate 
< 55 bpm prior to administration of the investigational drug.  Dose should be 
withheld for patients who have a pulse rate of <55  bpm prior to administration of 
investigational drug.  Atropine IV is recommended as the first line treatment of 

Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  60 bradycardia, up to a maximum daily dose of 3 mg.  In general, the common 
guidelines for treatment of bradycardia (eg, Advanced Cardiac Life Support 
guidelines) should be followed as appropriate.  
- Patients should be discontinued from participation in the trial if any of the below 
are present:  
o Mobitz type II 2nd degree AV block or  
o 3rd degree AV block or  
o Symptomatic bradycardia that is non -responsive to intervention (e.g., 
atropine or isoproterenol) and lasting ≥ 24 hours (i.e., across the entire 
dosing interval)  
 Pulmonary effects  
 Any condition that might affect the outcome of pulmonary function testing 
including infection, respiratory symptoms, occupatio nal exposures (including 
asbestos) and cigarette smoking needs to be collected before PFT testing and 
transcribed to the pulmonary function tests eCRF page. If patients have decline 
in PFT values (FEV 1 and/or FVC) below 50% of the predicted values, treatme nt 
should be discontinued.   If a patient discontinues due to respiratory AE, the 
Investigator should ensure that the patient has adequate evaluations as clinically 
indicated by a pulmonologist (consider PFTs, chest X -ray or high resolution 
computed tomogra phy, based on findings of the other exams) at the time of the 
AE.  For patients with pulmonary nodules, lung biopsy should be co nsidered 
(Cryptococcus  pneumonia and pulmonary TB have been reported with 
fingolimod).  Further evaluations will be conducted un til such time as resolution 
is confirmed or no further improvement is expected by the Investigator  (based on 
a follow-up period of not less than 3 months).  
 Hepatic effects  
 If patients have elevations in the LFTs (ALT or/and AST) ≥3x ULN, a retest 
should be performed as soon as  possible but not later than 14  days after the 
original test.  If the abnormality is confirmed , weekly testing should continue until 
ALT and AST are < 3x ULN .  If the ALT and/or AST stabilizes at a level > 3x 
ULN, the Medical Monitor may agree to less frequent  testing.   The Investigator 
should establish causality.   
 At any time, if any of the following occur and there are no apparent alternative 
causes for the finding , the investigational drug must be permanently discontinued 
: 
o ALT or AST > 8x ULN or  
o ALT or AST > 5x ULN with confirmation, within  2 weeks or  
o ALT or AST > 3x ULN and (total bilirubin > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5) or  
Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  61 o ALT or AST > 3x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
or right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, f ever, rash and/or eosinophilia 
(>5%) 
Investigator should establish causality.  
After discontinuation due to elevation of ALT or AST > 5x ULN or concurrent 
elevations of ALT or AST > 3x ULN and bilirubin > 2x ULN, further liver 
function evaluation should be performed (for example, coagulation panel  and 
alkaline phosphatase ) in consultation with the Medical Monitor . 
 Evaluation of alternative causes for the liver test abnormalities could include any 
of the following:  
o Acute viral hepatitis  
o Alcoholic or autoimmun e hepatitis  
o Hepatobiliary disorders  
o NASH 
o Cardiovascular causes  
o Concomitant treatments  
 Macular edema  
 For patients with abnormal OCT findings or with visual signs or symptoms of 
new onset or worsening macular edema that develop following initiation of 
treatment, a general ophthalmologic examination including eye history, visual 
acuity, and dilated ophthalmoscopy will also be performed  
 Investigational drug  must be discontinued in any patient who has a confirmed 
diagnosis of clinically significant macular edema  that is of new onset or worsened 
since baseline 
 Patients with a diagnosis of macular edema must be followed up monthly and 
more frequently if needed based on the ophthalmologist's judgment  
 Malignancies  
 Because RPC1063 is an immunomodulator, patients should be carefully 
monitored for infections and malignancies (including dermatologic malignancy)  
 The treating Investigator will complete a dermatological examination for 
monitoring of the potential development of new cutaneous malignancies during 
the trial.  Patients with any suspicious finding noted during the examination will 
be referred to an appropriately qualified dermatologist for evaluation and 
treatment, if warranted  
 Serious or opportunistic infections  
- TB, serious bacterial infections, systemic fu ngal infections, viral infections such 
as herpes infections (including herpes zoster and disseminated herpes simplex) 
and protozoan infections should be reported as AEs   
Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  62 - During the treatment period if a serious infection or a serious opportunistic 
infection is identified , investigational  drug should be suspended until the patient 
has received appropriate treatment and has had resolution of the infection.  
Investigational drug can be restarted  at the Investigator’s discretion after 
assessment of the patient’ s clinical status (See Section 9.1.1 for instructions on 
resuming treatment after missing doses)  
- Patients withdrawn from the trial as a result of the above will be followed until 
lymphocyte levels return to the patient’s pre -treatment baseline or to the central 
laboratory’s Lower Limi t of Normal, whichever is lower  
12.2.8. Monitoring of Patients with Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Investigators must carefully monitor each patient for AEs.  This includes clinical laboratory 
variables.  Assessments must be made of the seriousness, severity, and relationship to the 
administration of the investigational drug .  After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is 
required to follow up proactivel y with each patient and provide further information to the CRO 
on the patient’s condition.  During the trial, all AE/SAEs should be followed up to resolution 
unless the event is considered by the Investigator to be unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s 
underlying disease, or the patient is lost to follow -up.  Safety reporting must comply with 
ICH E6, 4.11. 
12.2.9. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB) for the trial will at a minimum perform 
quarterly safety reviews start ing after the first patient is dosed.  
12.2.10. Treatment of Overdose of Investigational Drug  
An overdose is any dose of investigational drug given to a patient or taken by a patient that 
exceeds the dose described in the protocol.  There is no information regarding  overdose with 
RPC1063.  Any overdose, with or without associated AEs, must be promptly reported to the 
CRO’s Medical Monitor or other designated Drug Safety Center.  Overdoses do not need to be 
recorded as AEs in the eCRF; only in the case of any AEs asso ciated with the overdose should 
these be reported on relevant AE/SAE sections in the eCRF.  
12.2.11. Procedures in Case of Pregnancy  
If a urine pregnancy test is positive, the Investigator will instruct the patient to suspend further 
RPC1063 dosing. If the test was  performed by the patient between scheduled visits, a follow -up 
appointment will be scheduled as soon as possible. A serum pregnancy test will be performed for 
confirmation.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an i nvestigational 
product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication; however, the 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and docume nted even if the patient was 
discontinued from the trial.  
Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  63 Male patients should also be instructed to notify the Investigator in the event that their female 
partner becomes pregnant.  Attempts should be made to follow female partners of trial patients, 
if they should become pregnant.  The Investigator must obtain informed consent from the 
pregnant partner of a trial patient prior to collecting data on her pregnancy and its outcome.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor and/or its designee .  
In cases of live birth, the infant will be fo llowed for up to a year.

13.1. Determination of  Sample Size 
Induction:  
The sample size of 60 patients has been chosen to enable estimate s of response and remiss ion 
rates with reasonable precision.  Assuming a remission rate of 15% and a response rate of 30%, 
it is estimated that the confidence interval (half -widths of the 95 % CI) around the proportion of 
patients in response and remission will be 12.8% and 16.4% for 30 patients and 9.0% and 11.6% 
for 60 patients . 
13.2. Statistical Methods  
13.2.1. General Considerations  
All efficacy and safety data will be listed by patient and summarized.  Baseline is defined as the 
last observed measurement prior to the Induction Period Day 1 receipt of investigational drug.  
In general, descriptive summaries will be presented for the efficacy and safety variables 
collected.  Continuous variables will be su mmarized using number of patients (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variables will be 
summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  
There will be no imputation for missing efficacy or safety observations  
13.2.2. Analysis Populations  
All patient populations will be defined and documented prior to database lock.  Due to the 
open-label, non -randomized nature of the trial design, the intent -to-treat (ITT) and safety 
populations will be the same: all enrolled patients wh o receive at least one dose of RPC1063.  
These populations will be used as the primary populations for all e fficacy and safety parameters.  
13.3. Disposition, Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
The number and percentage of patients in each population will be summarized.  Patient 
disposition, including the number of patients enrolled, dosed, completing the Induction Period, 
and not completing the Induction Period by reason for dropout,  entering the Extension Period, 
completing the Extension Period, and not c ompleting the Extension Period by reason for dropout 
will be summarized.  Patient demographics will be summarized and will include age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, height, weight, and body mass index.  
Baseline characteristics will be summarized for and will incl ude age at CD symptom onset, age 
at CD diagnosis, years since CD symptom onset, years since CD diagnosis, b aseline CDAI score, 
baseline SES -CD score, baseline PRO2 score,  prior anti-TNF use, and prior corticosteroid use.  
Compliance with investigational drug will be summarized and will include the number of 
patients estimated to be < 80% compliant, 80 to 100% compliant, and > 100% compliant.  The 
total dose and average daily dose will also be summarized.

As there are no hypothesis tests on the data collected in this trial, all efficacy endpoints will be 
reported using descriptive statistics.  Proportions of patients in response and proportions of 
patients in remission will include 95% confid ence intervals.  
13.5. Safety Analyses  
Adverse events will be monitored during the trial and the data analyzed with re spect to incidence 
as well as severity and potential re lationship of the AEs to investigational drug .  Adverse events  
with onset on, or after the first dose of investigational drug or with onset prior to the first dose of 
investigational drug  that increase in severity on, or after the first dose of investigational drug  will 
be considered treatment -emergent.   All treatmen t-emergent AEs will be coded and tabulated by 
system organ class and preferred term.  Incidence of AEs, SAEs, AEs of special interest, and 
AEs leading to discontinuation will be summarized and presented in descending order of 
frequency.  
Associated laborat ory parameters such as hepatic enzymes, renal function, and hematology 
values will be grouped and presented together.  Individual patient values will be listed and values 
outside of the standard reference range will be flagged.  Shift tables and analyses o f changes 
from baseline will be produced.  The change from baseline for each of the vital signs and ECG 
parameters will be summarized.  Incidence of abnormal vital signs parameters and outlier ECG 
results will be tabulated.

14.1. Monitoring  
The Sponsor has engaged the services of a CRO  to perform all monitoring functions within this 
clinical trial.  CRO Clinical Monitors will work in accordance with CRO SOPs and have the 
same rights and responsibilities as monitors from the Sponsor organization.  Clinical Monitors 
will establish and maintain regular contact with the Investigator.  
Monitoring visits will be conducted according to all applicable regulatory requirements and 
standards.  Regular monitoring visits will be made to each center while patients are enrolled 
in the trial.   
14.2. Data Management/Coding  
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) will be used for this trial, meaning that all eCRF data will be 
entered in electronic forms at the  site.  All EDC systems used in the trial will have access -
controlled security and an audit history available to document any changes made to the data 
throughout the course of the trial.  Data collection recorded in site source documents will be 
entered in to the eCRF by authorized site staff designated by the Investigator.  Patients will record 
daily diary information directly into an electronic diary, and this will be considered a source 
document.  Appropriate training and security measures will be complet ed with the Investigator, 
all authorized site staff, and patients prior to the trial being initiated and any data being entered 
into the system for and/or by any trial patients.  
All data entered by the site staff must be entered in English.  The eCRFs shou ld be completed 
contemporaneous to the patient’s visit.  The Investigator may delegate data entry, but is 
responsible for verifying that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct at the 
conclusion of the trial.   
Source documents are all docum ents used by the Investigator or hospital that relate to the 
patient’s medical history, that verify the existence of the patient, the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, and all records covering the patient’s participation in the trial.  They include laborat ory 
notes, ECG results, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, patient files, etc.  
Source documents will be made available for inspection by the Clinical M onitor at each 
monitoring visit.  The Investigator must complete eCRFs for each patient who receives  
investigational drug.  Any copy of source document(s) that are provided to the Sponsor or its 
representatives for any purpose (eg, in support of an SAE report) must be redacted such that all 
patient-identifying information is removed, and clearly labeled with the trial and patient number.  
All AEs and medical histories recorded in the eCRF will be coded using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Concomitant medications will be coded using the World 
Health Organization (WHO) drug dicti onary.  Versions of dictionaries to be used will be 
specified in the data management plan for the trial.

15.1. Study Monitor and Source Data Verification  
According to the Guidelines of Good  Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95), the Sponsor is 
responsible for implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems with 
written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) .   
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handl ing.   
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
 Investigator  meeting(s)   
 Central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters and ECGs   
 Center Initiation visit   
 Early center visits  post-enrollment   
 Routine center monitoring   
 Ongoing center  communication and training  
 Data management quality control checks   
 Continuous data acquisition and cleaning   
 Internal review of data  
 Quality control check of the final clinical study report  
In addition, Sponsor and/or CRO Clinical Quality Assurance Department may conduct periodic 
audits of the trial processes, including, but not limited to trial center, center visits, central 
laboratories, vendors, clinical database, and final clinical study repor t.  When audits are 
conducted, access must be authorized for all trial-related documents including medical history 
and concomitant medication documentation to authorized Sponsor’s representatives and 
regulatory authorities.  
15.2. Product Quality Complaint  
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that 
alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, 
purity, or performance of any drug product manufactured by or on behal f of Celgene after it is 
released for distribution.  PQCs may reduce the usability of the product for its intended function 
or affect performance of the product and therefore pose a significant risk to the patient. Examples 
of PQCs include (but are not lim ited to): mixed product, mislabeling, lack of effect, 
seal/packaging breach, product missing/short/overage, contamination, suspected falsified, 
tampered, diverted or stolen material, and general product/packaging damage.  If you become 
aware of a suspected  PQC, you are obligated to report the issue immediately.  You can do so by

16.1. Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee  
An Independent Ethics Committee should approve the final protocol, including the final version 
of the ICF and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the patients.  The 
Investigator will provide the Sponsor or CRO with documentation o f IRB/IEC approval of the 
protocol and informed consent before the trial may begin at the trial center(s).  The Investigator 
should submit the written approval to the Sponsor  or representative before enrollment of any 
patient into the trial. 
The Sponsor  or representative should approve any modifications to the ICF that are needed to 
meet local requirements.  
The Investigator will supply documentation to the Sponsor or CRO of required IRB/IEC’s 
annual renewal of the protocol, and any approvals of revisions to  the informed consent document 
or amendments to the protocol.  
The Investigator  will report promptly to the IRB/IEC, any new information that may adversely 
affect the safety of patients or the conduct of the trial.  Similarly, the Investigator  will submit 
written summaries of the trial status to the IRB/IEC annually, or more frequently if requested by 
the IRB/IEC .  Upon completion of the trial, the Investigator will provide the Ethics C ommittee 
with a brief report of the outcome of the trial, if required.  
16.2. Ethical Conduct of the Trial 
This trial will be conducted and the informed consent will be obtained according to the ethical 
principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki ( 48th General Assembly, Somerset West, 
Republic of South Africa, October 2008 [or  current version]), the applicable guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP; CPMP/ICH/135/95), or the applicable drug and data protection laws and 
regulations of the countries where  the trial will be conducted.  
Good Clinical Practice is an international e thical and scientific quality standard for designing, 
conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human patients.  The 
trial will be conducted in compliance with GCP and the applicable national regulations so as to 
assure that the rights, safety and well -being of the participating trial patients are protected 
consistent with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
16.3. Patient Information and  Consent 
The Investigator will explain the benefits and risks of participation in the trial to each patient, the 
impartial witness and obtain written informed consent.  Written informed consent must be 
obtained prior to the patient entering the trial and before initiation of any trial related procedure.  
The final, version dated form must be agreed to by the IRB/IEC and must be provided in 
language readily understood by the patient.  In case the patient is una ble to read or write, an 
impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion.  After the 
patient has orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature on the form will 
attest that the information in the co nsent form was accurately explained and understood.  The 
Investigator will retain an original consent form for each patient, signed and dated by the patient 
or witness, and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  The Investigator 
Sponsor: Celgene International II S àrl   Protocol No. RPC01-2201 
Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 in C D  24 May 2019 , Version 5.0 
 Confidential  71 will supply all enrolled patients with either a copy of their signed informed consent or, 
depending upon local requirements, a second original informed consent, signed by both parties.  
The consent form may need to be revised during the trial due to a protocol amendment or should 
important new information become available that may be relevant to the safety of the patient.  In 
this instance, approval should always be given by the IRB/IEC and existing patients informed of 
the changes and re -consented, as directed by the IRB/IEC and in accordance with its policies and 
procedures; however, in some instances where an immediate change is necessary to eliminate an 
apparent hazard to patients, then it would not be necessary for a protocol amendment to receive 
IRB/IEC rev iew and approval before being implemented.  Those patients who are presently 
enrolled and actively participating in the trial should be informed of the change if it might relate 
to the patients’ willingness to continue their participation in the trial.  
With the consent of the patient, the Investigator should inform the patient’s primary physician 
about participation in the clinical trial.  
16.4. Patient Data P rotection  
The ICF will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document 
incorporatin g) wording that complies with relevant data protection and privacy legislation.  
16.5. Investigator Obligations  
This trial will be conducted in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for 
GCP (GCP, 1997); the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) T itle 21 parts 50, 56, and 312; 
and European Legislation; and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.   
The Investigator agrees to conduct the clinical trial in compliance with this protocol after the 
approval of the pr otocol by the IEC/IRB in compliance with local regulatory requirements.  
The Investigator and the Sponsor will sign the protocol to confirm this agreement.  
16.6. Protocol Signatures  
After reading the protocol, each Investigator will sign the protocol signature p age and send a 
copy of the signed page to the Sponsor or representative (Appendix 1).  By signing the protocol, 
the Investigator confirms in writing that he/she has read, understands and will strictly adhere to 
the trial protocol and will conduct the trial  in accordance with ICH Tripartite Guidelines for 
Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements.  The trial will not be able to start 
at any center where the Investigator has not signed the protocol.

17.1. Inspection of Records  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents to record 
all observations and other pertinent data for each patient enrolled in the trial.  
The Investigator will allow the Sponsor, CRO, and authorized regul atory authorities to have 
direct access to all documents pertaining to the trial, including individual patient medical 
records, as appropriate.  
17.2. Retention of Records  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain essential trial documents (protocol and  protocol 
amendments, completed eCRFs, signed ICFs, relevant correspondence, and all other supporting 
documentation).  The trial site should plan on retaining such documents for approximately 
15 years after trial completion.  The trial site should retain s uch documents until at least 2  years 
after the last approval of a marketing application in an International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years after the formal discontinuation of clinical 
development of the investigational product.  These documents should be retained for a longer 
period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or the hospital, institution, or private 
practice in whic h the trial is being conducted.  Patient identification codes (patient names and 
corresponding trial numbers) will be retained for this same period of time.  These documents 
may be transferred to another responsible party, acceptable to Sponsor, who agrees  to abide by 
the retention policies.  Written notification of transfer must be submitted to Sponsor.  The 
Investigator must contact Sponsor prior to disposing of any trial records.   
No records should be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.

21. OVERVIEW OF KEY CHANGES  
The following bulleted list identifies the key changes to the protocol and provides the rationale 
for each change:  
 New contact information  
 Change to safety follow up from 75 days to  90-day (±10 days ) Safety Follow -up Visit 
to ensure adequate collection of adverse events that could be associated with 
investigational drug.  The timing of the visit is based on the estimated time needed to 
clear the major active metabolite s of RPC1063  in the vast majority of patients (ie, 5 
half-lives of CC 112273 and CC1084037 and accounting for variation of half -life 
duration in a human population ). 
 Extended re quirements for contraception in females after treatment discontinuation 
from the 75-day Safety Follow -up Visit to the 90-day Safety Follow -up Visit. 
 Updated description of RPC1063 to include major active metabolite

Section(s)  Original Text  Revised Text  or New Text  Rationale  
Section 5.2 
RPC1063  RPC1063 is a small molecule 
compound that selectively and 
potently activates the sphingosine 1 -
phosphate 1 receptor (S1P 1) and S1P 5 
receptor (S1P 5), although it is more 
selective towards S1P 1 over S1P 5.  In 
vitro, RPC1063 has little activity on 
the other S1P receptors, showing half 
maximal effective concentration 
(EC50) > 10,000 nM for S1P2, > 5000 
nM for S1P 3, and > 2000 nM for S1P 4.  
RPC1063 is extensively metabolized 
in humans with up to 13 metabolites  
identified in plasma, urine, and feces, 
including 1 major active metabolite 
(CC112273) in plasma. The RPC1063 
metabolites, CC112273, RP101988, 
RP101075, and RP101442, show a 
similar potency and selectivity profile 
to RPC1063.  RPC1063 ( ozanimod ) is a sphingosine 
1-phosphate receptor modulator, 
which binds with high affinity 
selectively to sphingosine 1 -phosphate 
receptor subtypes 1 and 5. RPC1063 
causes lymphocyte retention in 
lymphoid tissues. The mechanism by 
which RPC1063 exerts therapeutic 
effects in CD (Crohn’s disease) is 
unknown but may involve the 
reduction of lymphocyte migration 
into the central nervous system.  
 
RPC1063 is 10 -fold more selective for 
S1P1 relative to S1P 5 and has little 
activity on other S1P receptors (S1P 2, 
S1P3, and S1P 4). RPC1063 is 
extensively metabolized in humans to 
form a number of circulating active 
metabolites. In vitro, RPC1063 and its 
active metabolites demonstrated 
similar activity and selectivity for 
S1P1 and S1P 5. In humans, 
approximately 94% of circulating t otal 
active drug exposure is represented by 
RPC1063 (6%), CC112273 (73%), 
and CC1084037 (15%).

Table 2, 
Section 8.1   Counseling about pregnancy 
precautions and the potential risks of 
fetal exposure must be conducted for 
female subjects of childbearing

educate all FCBP about the different 
options of contraceptive methods or 
abstinence as a ppropriate. The subject 
will be re -educated every time her 
contraceptive measures/methods or 
ability to become pregnant changes. 
The female subject’s chosen form of 
contraception must be effective by the 
time the female subject is randomized 
into the study  (for example, hormonal 
contraception should be initiated at 
least 28 days before randomization).

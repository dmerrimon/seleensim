Monteris Medical  Strictly Confidential  Page 7 of 17 3 BACKGROUND  & PURPOSE   
Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a m inimally invasive technique to necrotize  intracranial 
abnormal tissues , originally introduced in 1983. Its use in neurosurgical procedures was historically 
limited by early technical difficulties related to the monitoring and control of the extent of thermal 
distribution . The development of magnetic resonance thermography and its application to LITT has 
allowed for real -time thermal imaging and feedback control during laser energy delivery, allowing for 
precise and accurate delivery of tissue hyperthermia. Improvements in laser probe design, surgical 
stereotactic targeting hardware , and computer monitoring software has accelerated acceptance and 
clinical utilization of LITT as a neurosurgical treatment alternative.  There is l imited outcome data available 
from utilization of current commercially available LITT systems.  
The NeuroBlate® System (NBS) is a minimally invasive robotic laser thermotherapy tool  that is 
manufactured by Monteris Medical . It employs a pulsed surgical laser to deliver targeted energy to 
abnormal brain tissue . With the NBS, a surgeon makes a small hole in the skull, approximately as wide as 
a pencil. A small probe is then used to deliver laser light energy  to heat and destroy the target tissue . The 
NBS combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and software -based visualization to necrotize targeted 
tissues in locations in the brain, either superficial or deep . During the procedure, a surgeon operates the 
ablation  remotely  through a computer module. An MRI -compatible robotic probe driver helps the surgeon 
precisely guide the laser probe to the planned ablation area and apply heat in controlled amounts, until 
the targeted tissue is destroyed.  
To further understand performance and utilization of  the NBS in current standard of care, a post-market 
multi -center registry , LAANTERN (Laser Ablation of Abnormal Neurological Tissue using Robotic 
NeuroBlate® system) , is designed to collect  baseline,  procedural and follow -up data on subjects  that are 
to undergo  thermal therapy using the NBS. The LAANTERN registry is conducted  in an observational 
manner with objectives designed for publication purposes.  
 
4 STUDY  DEVIC E 
Any commercially available component of NeuroBlate® System  may be used for  the registry  which 
includes, probe, robotic probe driver, and software . For more details regarding system description and

5.2 STUDY POPULATION  
Subjects who meet inclusion  criteria and no exclusio n criteria and sign the Informed Consent Form  (ICF)  
(CL10030 ) will be  considered enrolled in this study . At the time of enrollment, a unique identification 
number (ID) will be assigned to the subject and used to collect all study  information via  electronic  Case 
Report Forms ( eCRFs).  
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Subject or legally authorized representative provides written authorization and/or consent  
2. Subject  who is  to undergo  thermal therapy by the NeuroBlate® System for treatment of their 
neurological  disorder  
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Subject who is, or is expected to be inaccessible for follow -up 
2. Other concurrent medical or other condition (chronic or acute in nature) that , in the opinion of the 
investigator , may prevent participation or otherwise render patient ineligib le for the study  
 
6 INFORMED CONSENT (ICF)  
The Sponsor will provide a template ICF to each site for IRB submission prior to the site initiation. This 
template may be modified to suit the requirements of the individual study site. The Sponsor must pre -
approve all changes to the ICF prior to initial submission to the IRB. A copy of the IRB -approved ICF must 
be sent to the Sponsor and the original copy must be retained at the study site. If the ICF is amended by 
the reviewing IRB, the Sponsor must pre -approve all changes to the ICF prior to submission.  In addition, 
a copy of the approved documents must be provided by the Investigator to the Sponsor prior to 
enrollment of subjects in the study.  
The Investigator or assigned designee must administer this approved ICF to each prospective study 
subject and obtain the subject’s signature or a legally authorized representative signature along with the 
date of consent prior to enrollment in the study.  The ICF must be obtained in accordance with 21 CFR 
Part 50. Subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any 
reason without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled and 
informed that withdrawal from the study will not jeopardize their future medical care.  A copy of ICF must 
be given to each subject enrolled in the study. The institutional standard subject consent form does not 
replace the study ICF . 
 
7 STUDY VISITS  
A subject follow -up schedule is intended to align with typical standard of care practices. Data may be 
collected during in -office subject visits or remotely (e.g. telephone, email, or mail), when feasible and 
appropriate. These modes of data collection aim  to help facilitate robust and reliable long -term 
surveillance and survival data collection.  For this standard of care  registry,  the visit windows are 
continuous, however target visit dates are provided below.   Visits sh ould be completed near the target 
visit date or  be the most complete visit  within the visit window. A visit window tool is available in the EDC 
system.  Figure 1 indicates the sequence of subject visits.

medication for the following : 
o Steroids  
o Anticonvulsants (including antiseizure drugs)   
o Chemotherapy medication  
o Anticoagulation  
o Immunotherapy (e.g. bevacizumab, pembrolizumab)  
 
7.2 REGISTRY REQUIRED QUESTIONNAIRES  
Completion of questionnaires is required for this study. Questionnaires may be completed remotely  via 
phone , mail or email if an office visit will not be completed. If a given questionnaire is not completed for a 
subject at Baseline, analysis of questionnaire data for this subject is not possible. Therefore, if the Baseline 
Questionnaire is not completed, this questionnaire is not required during follow -up and will not be 
compensated.    
 
EuroQol -5D (EQ -5D) (All Subjects 16 years old  and older ); EuroQol -5D-Y (EQ-5D-Y) (All subjects 8 -15 
years old)  
The EQ -5D provides simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. This 
questionnaire consists of 2 pages: 1) the EQ -5D-3L descriptive system and 2) the EQ Visual 
Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system assesses subject’s mob ility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self -rated 
health on an approximately 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled ‘the best 
health you can imagine’ and ‘the worst health you can imagine’. The VAS will be utilized to assess 
subject pain at the lesion site or on head.  
 
FACT –Br (CNS malignancy subjects only 18 years old  and older ) FACT -Peds -Br-Adolescent  (12-17 
years old) and FACT -Peds -Br-Child  (7-12 years old)  
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Brain ( FACT -Br) is a commonly used instrument 
measuring general quality of life that reflects symptoms or problems associated with brain 
malignancies across 5 scales. FACT -Br is a brain tumor specific 50 -item questionnaire for subjects 
who are not neurologically incapacitated. It will provide an overall QOL score as well as sub -scores 
for physical well -being, social/family well -being, emotional well -being, functional well -being and 
concerns relevant to subjects with b rain tumors.  
 
QOLIE -31 (Epilepsy subjects only >18 years old): QOLIE -AD-48 (11-18 years old)  QOLCE -55 (Care Giver 
provider).  
The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE -31) contains seven multi -item scales that tap the 
following health concepts: emotional well -being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, cognitive 
functioning, seizure worry, medication effects, and overall quality of life. A QOLIE -31 overall score is 
obtained using a weighted average of  the multi -item scale scores. The QOLIE -31 also includes a 
single item that assesses overall health.  
The QOLIE -AD-48 is a survey of health -related quality of life for adolescents (11 -18 years of age) 
with epilepsy.  
The QOLCE -55 is a survey of health -related quality of life for pediatrics answered by their care giver .

Monteris Medical  Strictly Confidential  Page 13 of 17 7.5 STUDY COMPLETION OR WITHDRAW AL 
Subjects will complete the study  once their 5-year follow -up visit is completed or if the subject was 
prematurely withdrawn  prior to  their 5-year visit.  
The subject may be  prematurely  withdrawn from the study  for the following reasons:  
• Subject did not have NeuroBlate® Procedure . 
• Subject Lost to Follow -up: All efforts shall be made to document at least 3 attempts to 
contact subject,  which would include a certified letter to the subject. If  attempts to contact 
the subject fail , the subject may be withdrawn from the study  and considered lost to 
follow up.  
• Subject Withdrawal: A subject may voluntarily withdraw from the study  at any time.   
• Investigator Withdrawal of  Subject : An Investigator may withdraw a subject  for reasons 
which may include noncompliance, failure to keep appointments, etc.  
• Subject  Death: If subject passed away, the expiration date will be considered the end of 
study date.  All feasible attempts should be made to confirm date of death, as this is key 
for overall survival analysis.  
 
8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
It is the site’s responsibility to report Adverse Events in compliance with their Institutional Review Board.  
 
8.1 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS BY CLINICAL SITES  
The following adverse events  (AE) are considered reportable for this study , as determined by PI 
discretion : 
NeuroBlate® System related AEs  
• Adverse events related to the NeuroBlate® System  Device (i.e. probe, robotic probe 
driver, software ) 
NeuroBlate® Procedure related AEs  
• Adverse events that occur due to a NeuroBlate® (LITT) procedure and cannot be directly 
attributed to the NBS Device  or surgical procedure  
Surgical Procedure related AEs  
• Adverse events that occur due to the surgical procedure and cannot be directly attributed 
to NeuroBlate® System or procedure  (i.e. biopsy related event)  
The following adverse events are considered not reportable for this registry : 
• Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition without serious deterioration in health . 
• Any expected postoperative  complaints or symptoms such as pain at biopsy site, 
headaches, weakness, cerebral edema, and transient events (less than 30 days from 
procedure) that do not require intervention. If the  event involves a clinically significant 
change in severity or duration of symptoms or  requires clinical intervention that is 
different from ordinary postoperative care , the event  is considered a reportable AE .  
Reportable AEs must be described by duration (start and resolution dates), relationship to the 
NeuroBlate® System or surgical procedure, action taken to resolve the event , and outcome of the event. 
Additional information, such as procedural notes, treatment notes, or clinical summary may be requested 
as supporting documentation .  
  
CL10027                    LAANTERN Prospective Registry Protocol  Rev D .2 
Monteris Medical  Strictly Confidential  Page 14 of 17 8.2 ADVERSE EVENT RELATEDNESS  
The relationship of the AE to the NeuroBlate® System  Device ( NBS) or the NeuroBlate® (LITT) procedure 
or surgical procedure will be determined by the Primary Investigator  (PI) based upon the following 
definitions.  
Definite:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal and causative sequence from receipt (or 
attempted receipt) of the device treatment or procedure.   
Possible:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from receipt of the device treatment 
or procedure and the possibility of device treatment or procedure involvement cannot be 
excluded. However, other factors such as underlying disease, concomitant medications , or 
concurrent treatment are presumable.  
Not Related:  The AE has no temporal sequence from receipt of the device treatment or 
procedure, or it can be explained by other factors, including underlying disease, concomitant 
medication, or concurrent treatment . Note: If the event is determined to be “Not Related” to either 
the NBS or the Surgical Procedure, it is not considered a reportable AE.  
 
8.3 SAFETY COMMITTEE  
 
A Safety Committee will be used to review reported events to provide unbiased third -party adjudication for 
publications.  
9 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A deviation is defined as an event that did not occur according to the registry protocol . For the purpose of 
this registry , and in consideration of standard of care practices across study sites, anticipated  protocol 
deviation s include : improper  consenting of subject  (i.e. consent not obtained  and improper consenting ) 
and not  completing study required questionnaires (if not completed at baseline only one deviation needs 
to be completed for that subject  or if completed at baseline but a subsequent visit or questionnaire is not 
completed then a deviation for the missed timepoint need s to be completed) A deviation is not required if 
a questionnaire is not completed because the subject does not meet the age requirement for the 
validated QOL.  
All deviations will be reported to Monteris Medical.  It is the site’s responsibility to report deviations in 
compliance with their Institutional Review Board.  
 
10 DATA ANALYSIS  
Data  collected in this study  is observational  and there is no pre -defined  study  hypothesis. Descriptive 
statistics will be used to analyze data. Continuous variables will be summarized with means, standard 
deviations, minimums, and maximums. Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency 
distributions.  
 
11 CORE LAB  
MRIs will be collected according to the Study Visit Schedule . Standard of Care MRI imaging will be sent 
to the Imaging Core Lab  for analysis  as per the sponsor . The immediate pre -operative and immediate 
post operative images (to include T1 pre -contrast, T1 post -contrast, T2 FLAIR, and any other sequences 
obtained during these timepoints as per standard of care at that institution) are required for upload to 
Monteris. Per core lab or cohort specific needs, additional  standard of care imaging at various  timepoints 
may be requested  by the sponsor in accordance with the site clinical trial agreement (CTA) . The sponsor

of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50 (Protection of Human Patients ), 56 (Institutional Review Board), 
and applicable requirements from the reviewing IRB for the study  at each site .  
 
12.1 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
The study  data will be hosted in  an electric data capture ( EDC ) system . The EDC system will be 
compliant with the U.S. regulations, 21 CFR part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures.   
All required data for this study will be collected on standardized Case Report Forms (CRFs).  
Qualified study staff at each investigational site will perform primary data collection drawn from source 
document (e.g. hospital chart) review. All CRFs will be subject to review for omitted data, gross data 
inconsistencies, illegible data , and deviations. Any deficiencies or deviations will be reviewed,  and any 
necessary action determined (e.g. data query, communication to the study center).  
Data review (including crosschecks) will be performed and any discovered errors will be reported to the 
study site using the data correction and query process (as necessary). The study site will review the 
query, respond , and make any necessary corrections or comments. The data cleaning cycle will be 
repeated until all data are considered clean.

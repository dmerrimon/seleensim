 1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the 
applicable  federal  regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures.  
 
1.1 Background  
 
Recurrent aphthous  stomatitis (RAS), or canker sores, represents a very common mucosal disorder, occurring in 
men and women of all ages, races and geographic regions and affecting up to 60% of North Americans.1 The 
word ‘aphthous’  originates from the Greek word aphtha referring to an ulcer of the mucosal surface and 
‘stomatitis ’ refers to inflammation of the oral mucosa. Patients suffer from simple aphthosis, meaning they 
develop only occasional canker sores a few times per year which are a nuisance, but are not otherwise a difficult 
problem . 
 
However, a subset of individuals with RAS  suffer from a severe variant with persistent, refractory ulcers which 
may be present more often than not. This sub set of canker sore sufferers tend to have more painful, persistent 
canker sores which may be larger, with multiple lesions occurring synchronously. These ulcers can take several 
weeks to heal, and as one episode resolves, another bout of ulcers develops. P atients often have ulcers present 
more than 50% of the time, and go from one episode of aphthosis into another so that they are seldom ulcer 
free. 
 
Severe RAS (ulcers present more often than not/multiple, large ulcers/present synchronously/ slow to heal) – is 
sometimes referred to as "complex aphthosis" a term suggested by Jorizzo and Rogers2, experts in the field of 
oral dermatology. Such patients are otherwise healthy, with no systemic disease and few to no comorbid 
conditions. It is tho ught that this phenomenon may represent an "up regulation" of the immune system.3 Attacks 
of RAS may be precipitated by local trauma, stress, food intake, drugs, hormonal changes and vitamin and trace 
element deficiencies.1 Local and systemic conditions, and gen etic, immunological and microbial factors all may 
play a role in the pathogenesis of RAS.1 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
 
Otezla (a premilast) 30mg .  
 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
 
To date, no principal cause for RAS has been established. The lesions of RAS are painful and disabling to many 
patients and there are a large number of patients who seek treatment for this debilitating condition. 
Unfortunately, the disorder is not well unde rstood and often managed by generalists or oral surgeons.  
Since the etiology is unknown  and there are no specific diagnostic tests , the diagnosis is based on history and 
clinical criteria. The long-term prognosis for patients with severe RAS is excellent because  with time and 
increasing age, the condition may remit. However, patients may face 10 to 15 years of recurrent aphthosis and 
hence, treatment during this phase is warranted, to improve the severity of oral ulcers.1 
 
By way of clarification , – severe RAS (or complex aphthosis) – is quite discrete from Behç et’s disease, which 
also is characteristically associated with oral ulceration. In contradistinction, Beh çet’s disease is a rare, chronic, 
multisystemic disorder characterized by mucocutaneous, ocular, vascular and central nervous system 
6/21/2017  
Alison Bruce, MD  Page 7 
 manifestations, and is  thought to be  a systemic vasculitis.4 The clinical spectrum is wide and may include  oral 
and genital ulcers among the  many clinical features. The etiopathogenesis of Behçet’s disease remains 
unknown, although genetic predisposition, environmental factors and immunological abnormalities have been 
implicated.5 The prognosis of Beh çet’s disease is very different and may be guarded depending on the extent of 
the systemic v asculitis and treatment may be  lifelong. Despite the distinction between severe RAS and Beh çet’s 
disease, it is postulated that treatments that attenuate the mucosal manifestations of Beh çet’s may also be 
effective in management of severe RAS . 
 
A phase 2, double -blind, placebo -controlled study was publis hed in 2015 which demonstrated a premilast to be 
effective in treating the oral ulcers manifested in Beh çet’s disease.6 Given that oral ulcers are the cardinal 
manifestation of Beh çet’s disea se, it has been suggested that a premilast may also be effective in patients with 
severe RAS.  
 
To date, there has been one case7 reported in which a pat ient with RAS was treated with a premilast. This was a 
male in his 60’s with a history of recurrent oral ulcers for 3 years duration. After not responding to topical and 
systemic corticosteroids , antibiotics, and colchicine, a premilast monotherapy was initiated and gradually titrated 
to a maintenance dose of 30 mg twice daily. Within 6 weeks, there was complete clearance of all lesions and 
there was no disease recurrence over  12 months of follow -up.  
 
Further investigation is neede d to better define the role of a premilast  in patients with severe RAS, as it may 
represent a safe and effective alternative to current management options . 
 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
 
Based on the safety and effi cacy of previous studies using a premilast for Beh çet’s dise ase and psoriasis, t he 
dose of a premilast 30mg was chosen for the present study.  Subjects will receive a premilast 30mg twice daily for 
16 weeks. Since a premilast  is known to be associated with gastrointestinal side effects and headaches, the dose 
will be increased gradually during the first week of treatment until the full 30mg dose is reached.  
The expected benefits from a premilast use include reduction in the nu mber and duration of oral ulcers , 
decreased oral  ulcer pain, improved physical function and quality of life in patients w ith RAS.  Risks associated 
with a premilast therapy include possible  gastrointestinal side effects, headaches , upper respiratory tract 
infection , hypersensitivity reactions  and depression.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective  
• To evaluate the efficacy of a premilast for the treatment of RAS.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate  the safety and tolerability of a premilast in subjects with RAS .

 3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
 
The study will be a pilot study using a premilast 30mg orally twice daily , for treatment of RAS in males and 
females between 18 and 70 ye ars old .  
 
Subjects will be recruited from the clinical practice of the Department of Der matology  or Division of 
Rheumatology  at Mayo Clinic Florida. Fifteen males and  females  with RAS  will be enrolled.  
 
The study will consist of 3  phases: a s creening phase, a 16 week treatment phase and a n 8 week posttreatment 
observational follow -up phase.  
 
The screening phase  will consist of: obtaining informed consent, demographic information, medical history, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, prior and concomitant medication use, a dverse events ; collecting vital signs and 
weight; performing complete physical examination and limited physical examination; obtaining hematology, 
serum chemistry, urinalysis, pregnancy test and providing contraception education.  
 
During t he 16-week treatment  phase , all subjects receive apremilast.  
 
All subjects who complete the active treatment phase are to enter the 8 -week posttreatment observational 
follow -up phase.  
 
3.1.1 Contraception Education  
 
The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilas t are not known at this time.  Results of the animal and 
in vitro studies can be found in the IB.    
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved contraceptive options as described 
in section 4.1.1  while on investigational prod uct (IP) and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose 
of the IP. 
When a female subject of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant 
changes at the time of study entry or at any time during the study, th e Investigator will educate the subject 
regarding options and correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully 
prevent pregnancy.  
 
 
3.2 Study population  
 
Male and female subjects between 18 and 70 years old at the time of consent, who have diagnosis of RAS and 
who have had at least 2 oral ulcers  in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment  at baseline . 
 
3.3 Primary Study Endpoints  
 
Improvement in the following parameter s of the RAS lesions : %change in the number of ulcers  at the end of 
treatment , duration of ulcers and duration of the remission period between ulcer episodes . 
6/21/2017  
Alison Bruce, MD  Page 9 
 3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints  
 
• Type, frequency, severity and relatio nship of the adverse events to a premilast  
• Number of subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment due to any adverse event  
• Frequency of clinically significant changes in vital signs and/or laboratory findings

 4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time for the following:  
• Subject safety issues  related to serious reactions such as bacterial  or viral skin infection, fever, or tissue 
hypertrophy . 
• Subject decision to withdraw from the study (withdrawal of consent)  
• Subject’s decision to pursue other therapeutic regimens, either surgical or non -surgical  
 
4.4.2 Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdraw n Subjects  
 
Even though a subject has withdrawn from the study, it will be important to collect follow -up or survival data 
on subjects throughout the protocol defined follow -up period. Such data are important to the integrity of the 
final study analysis. I f a subject withdraws consent to participate in the study for subject safety reasons , 
attempts will be made to obtain permission to collect follow up information whenever possible.  Patients will be 
analyzed by intention to treat principles.  
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
 
Apremilast  is an oral  small -molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 that works intracellularly to 
modulate a network of pro -inflammatory and anti -inflammatory mediators. PDE 4 is a cyclic  adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) -specific PDE and  the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibition 
elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in tur n dow n-regulates the inflammatory response by modulating 
the expression of TNF -alfa, IL -23, IL -17 and othe r inflammatory cytokines. Cyclic AMP also mod ulates  
levels of anti-inflammatory  cytokines  such as IL -10. Apremilast has immunomodulatory activity and, 
therefore, has the potential to be effective in the treatment of RAS.   
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
 
Subjects will receive a premi last 30mg twice daily for 15  weeks. Since Apremilast is known to be associated 
with gastrointestinal side effects and headaches, the dose will be increased gradually in the first week according 
to the following schedule:  
 
Day 1: 10mg in morning  
Day 2: 10mg in morning and 10mg in evening  
Day 3: 10mg in morning and 20mg in evening  
Day 4: 20mg in morning and 20mg in evening  
Day 5: 20mg in morning and 30mg in evening  
Day 6 and thereafter: 30mg twice daily  
5.3 Administration of Study Drug  
 
Subjects will receive a premila st 30mg twice daily orally for 15  weeks  after 1 week  of titration . Patients will be 
advised to tak e the medication in the morning and evening, with water.   
 
6/21/2017  
Alison Bruce, MD  Page 12 
   
5.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 
Subjects will be  allowed the following  concomitant therapies to control flares: Tylenol, lidocaine 2% topical mouth 
wash and lidocaine 2% plus diphenhydramine plus Maalox topical mouth wash.   
No topical and systemic therapies for RAS may be used 3 months prior to study enrollment.  
6 Study Procedures  
 
a. The screening phase  will consist of: obtaining informed consent, demographic information, medical 
history, inclusion and exclusion criteria, prior and concomitant medication use, adverse eve nts; 
collecting vital signs and weight; performin g com plete physical examination, hematology, serum 
chemistry  (vitamins B1, B6, B12, C, iron, folate, z inc, TTG, ANA) , urinalysis, pregnancy testing, 
contraception edu cation . Patients will also be assessed in regards to number of oral ulcers and pain 
visual analog scale for oral ulcers.  A diary will be provided to the patient for keeping record of number 
and pain intensity of oral ulcers throughout the study.  
b. At baseline (week 0) all patients will  undergo a complete medical history and limited physical  
examination , suitability assessment  (inclusion and exclusion criteria) , and safety assessments (adverse 
events, vital signs, weight, contraception education) .  Patients will also be assessed in relation to  number 
of oral ulcers, pain visual analog scale for oral ulcers, physician’ s global assessment of oral lesions  and 
Chronic Oral Muc osal Disease Questionnaire – COM DQ) and the investigational product will be 
dispensed.  
c. At week  2 all patient s will undergo safety assessments (adverse events , vital signs, weight, and 
contraception  education ), efficacy assessments (number of oral ulcers, pain visual analog scale for oral 
ulcers, physician’s global assessment of oral lesi ons) and investigational product accountability.  
d. At week  4 all patients will undergo safety assessments (adverse events, vital signs , weight , and 
contraception  education), efficacy assessments (number of oral ulcers, pain visual analog scale for oral 
ulcers, physician’s global assessment of oral lesions) and investi gational product accountability. The 
investigational product will be dispensed.  
e. At week 8 all pati ents will undergo safety assessments (adverse events, vital signs, limited physical 
examination, weight,  contraception education , and optional lab work per Investigator’s discretion, 
including hematology and serum chemistry ), efficacy assessments (number of oral ulcers, pain visual 
analog scale for oral ulcers , physician’s global assessment of oral lesions and Chronic Oral Mucosal 
Disease Questionnaire – COM DQ) and investigational product accountability. The investi gational

Statistical Plan  
6.2 Sample Size Determination  
 
A total of 15  patients will be enrolled in this study. T his sample size will be sufficient in order to gain valuable 
data that could be used in the design of a future, larger study. Given the pilot/feasibility nature of the study, no 
formal power calculations were performed.  
 
6.3 Statistical Methods  
 
Data Analysis – Given the design, all statistical analysis will be descriptive . Continuous outcome measures will 
be summarized using the sample mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 25th and 75th percentiles, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized wi th number and percentage. 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) will be  estimated where appropriate.  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
 
We will summarize continuous variables using the sample mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 25th 
and 75th percentiles, and maximum. We will summarize categorical variables with number and percentages. 
Ordinal variables will be summarized using the s ample median, minimum, 25th and 75th percentiles, and 
maximum, as well as with number and percentage.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
 
Given the prospective nature of the study, we expect to encounter little if any missing data. However in the 
event of missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made in this pilot study; missing data will 
be treated as missing.  
 
Multiplicity  
 
No adjustment for multiple testing will be made owing to the exploratory, pilot nature of the study.  
 
Primary Hypothesis : 
 
We hypothesize that a premilast  administration  for RAS  will decrease the number of ulcers at the end of 
treatment compared to baseline.    
 
The primary endpoints of the study is the change in number of ulcers at the end of treatment compared to 
baseline.  
 
The seconda ry endpoints of the study, occurrence of adverse reactions and morbidity, are both dichotomous 
categorical variables. As such, the proportion for which these outcomes occur will be estimated along with 95% 
confidence interval .

 Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analysis  will be performed in this pilot study.  
 
6.4 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
All-treated population :  Any subject randomized into the study that received study drug .  
 
 
7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSO)  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychol ogical, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including 
individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse 
experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or pr olonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or 
significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new 
information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the 
opinion of the local investigator may adversely affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or 
others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e., unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential 
risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an 
underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" wh en it was unforeseeable at the time of its 
occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an 
increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the r esearch procedures.  
 
 
Adverse Event  
 
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, device, biologic) 
in a patient or research subject.  
 
 
Serious Adverse Event  
 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well defined and 
include;  
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospitalization  inpatient, new, or prolonged;  
• disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant birt h defect/anomaly  
6/21/2017  
Alison Bruce, MD  Page 17 
 • important medical event  
 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life threatening or 
result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgi cal 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.   
 
or other events that in the opinion of the sponsor -investigator may have adversely affected the rights, 
safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the re search data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is 6 months  after enrollment. The  adverse event monitoring 
period will end at th e end of the follow -up period. If an event is reported after this time it would need to be 
determined whet her or not it is study related.  
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the  
study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of 
the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definiti on of an adverse event must 
also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the sponsor -investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the sponsor -
investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor -investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the 
subject, or the subject’s personal physicia n, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if it was exhibited as a severe 
reaction i.e. swelling, that required hospitaliz ation or additional clinical intervention.  
 
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as a serious adverse event unless specifica lly instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an 
adverse event.   
 
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in 
the following circumstances:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a 
preexisting c ondition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose 
of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
6/21/2017  
Alison Bruce, MD  Page 18 
 • Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement for the  study.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.  
 
7.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
All adverse e vents will be documented as required , under 21 CFR part 1271. Depending on the nature and 
seriousness of the adverse reaction,  the IRB will be notified according to the Mayo Clinic IRB policy. If An 
SAE occurs it will also be reported to the FDA as per reg ulations  
 
At each contact with the subject, the study team must seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and al so in the appropriate adverse event section of the case report form 
(CRF) or separate worksheet.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or 
procedure results should recorded in the source document.  
 
All adverse events occu rring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study 
treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of 
the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome.  
 
7.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take ap propriated action necessary to protect the 
study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and/or log.  The sponsor -investigator 
will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up and reporting required.  
The SAE must be rep orted immediately (i.e., within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event) to 
Celgene Safety by facsimile.  A written report (prepared by the Investigator(s) using an SAE Report Form or a 
3500A Medwatch form  is to be faxed to Safety (see below  for contact information).

7.3.1 Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of 
a female subject or the female partner of a male subject  occurring while the subject is on study drug, or within 
30 days of the subject’s last dose of study drug, are considered immediately reportable events.  Study drug is to 
be discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused po rtion of the study drug to the 
investigator(s).  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene 
Safety immediately facsimile using the Pregnancy Report form provided by Celgene.

 7.3.2 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: n otifying the Mayo IRB  
The sponsor -investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPIRTSOs and Non -UPIRTSOs according to the 
Mayo IRB Policy and Procedures.  
7.4 Stopping Rules  
Study enrollment and treatment procedures will be suspended in the event that a subjec t experience s treatment 
related  Adverse Event while on study .  The study would only be resumed after a thorough review of the 
incidents and any corrective and preventative actions have been put in place along with consultation between 
the study team and th e IRB.  
7.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction a nd 
implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 - “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and 
Inspecting”).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse 
events.  
 
8 Data Handling and Record K eeping  
8.1 Data Handling  
Data will be collected and entered by the study coordinator  assigned to the project, and stored into a REDCap 
database.  
 
Variables to be collected include: (please list variables to be collected, at different time points if applicable)  
8.2 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the 
ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that h ave 
revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least 
vital status (long term survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
Hard copy data such as consent  forms will be stored in locked file cabinets; electronic data will be stored in 
secure web -based database (REDCap) that will be designed with the help of the statistician.  
8.3 Source Documents  
Source data are all information, original records of clinical fin dings, observations, or other activities in a clinical 
trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  
Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, cl inical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded 
data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and

 complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records 
kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
Data Management  
Study data will be managed in a study specific REDCap system  
 
Data Security and Confidentiality  
 
The REDCap system has built in systems for control of access, data integrity and audit trails. Access and 
confidentiality are controlled in a manner similar to other institutional system s. 
8.4 Records Retention

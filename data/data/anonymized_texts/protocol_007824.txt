 PROTOCOL  
Background  
1. Provide the scientific background, rationale and relevance of this project.   
Answer/Response:  [REDACTED]   Anxiety symptoms  are experienced by up to 71% of persons 
with H untington’s disease  (PwHD), causing significant burden for patients and caregivers 2, 3. 
[REDACTED]  Further, there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate 
efficacy of a specific psychological intervention for anxiety symptoms in PwHD. [REDACTED]   
Our long -term goal is to develop effective, accessible non -pharmacological interventions to 
reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative movement disorders  
(e.g., HD, Parkinson’s disease [PD]). With this overarching purpose in mind, our next step is to 
evaluate a cognitive bias modification for interpretation bias (CBM -I) intervention for reducing 
anxiety symptoms in PwHD. [REDACTED]  For the current proposal,  we will [REDACTED]  pilot an 
existin g web -based CBM -I intervention (MindTrails) in PwHD . MindTrails (PI: Teachman) is a 
free, multi -session, internet -delivered CBM -I training intervention to reduce anxious thinking. 
Participants complete five, weekly 20 -minute modules designed to encourage cognitive 
flexibility through repeated practice assign ing benign resolutions to ambiguous, anxiety -
provoking situations. Launched in 2016, it has been completed by thousands of individuals and 
has been found to r educe interpretation bias and anxiety symptoms in a community sample 
with high trait anxiety 13. 
PD sub -study:  
As in HD, anxiety is very common in people with Parkinson’s disease  (PD) . In keeping with our 
long -term goal  to develop effective, accessible non -pharmacological interventions to reduce 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative movement disorders  (e.g., HD, 
PD), we will [REDACTED]  pilot an existing web -based CBM -I intervention (MindTrails) in PwPD.  
 
[REDACTED]  Objectives/Hypothesis  
Answer/Response:   
Main study:  
[REDACTED]  Aim 2 : To assess feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a web -based CBM -I 
intervention (MindTrails) for reducing interpretation bias and anxiety symptoms in PwHD  
Hypothesis 2: MindTrails will be feasible and will demonstrate preliminary efficacy  for reducing 
interpretation bias and anxiety symptoms in PwHD.  
N=20 PwHD will enroll in a pilot open trial of the existing MindTrails protocol. Mixed effects 
models will be used to evaluate preliminary effects of the intervention on interpretation bias 
and anxiety symptom change.  
Aim 3 : To conduct a qualitative evaluati on of the MindTrails program in HD  
Hypothesis 3: Qualitative data will reveal overall satisfaction with MindTrails and 
recommendations for future trials.  
Participants in the Aim 2 open trial will be invited to complete qualitative interviews regarding 
their experiences with the MindTrails intervention (invite n=20 to obtain a minimum of n=10

Aim 2: To assess feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a web -based CBM -I intervention 
(MindTrails) for reducing interpretation bias and anxiety symptoms in PwHD  
Subjects (N=20)  will complete five, 20 -minute Min dTrails training sessions over five weeks, 
consistent with the existing MindTrails protocol which has been found to modify negative 
interpretations and reduce anxiety 13. In addition, they will complete assessments included in 
the established MindTrail s measures , which measure anxiety symptoms (Depression, Anxiety, 
Stress Scales -Short Form [DASS]: Anxiety Subscale  (DASS AS)23), depressive symptoms (DASS: 
Depression Subscale 23), interpretation bias  (BBSIQ 14), a mental health history and treatment 
questionnaire , and user experience surv ey. These assessments will be completed at baseline, 
after training sessions in weeks 3 and 5, and 2 months following the last (week 5) training 
session to assess durability of the effects. We will also collect HD-specific demographic data   
via Demographic HD History Interpret  (e.g., CAG repeat length on the HD -affected allele) at 
baseline and HD -related measures  (NeuroQoL -Anxiety, NeuroQoL -Depression 20, 21, and our 
novel MDIB measure) that are not included in the established MindTrails protocol.  
 
 
Aim 3: To conduct a qualitative evaluation of the MindTrails program in HD   
Subjects will complete a semi -structured interview that about their experiences with MindTrails 
and anxiety. Dr. Gibson  or study staff  will also administer the Total Functional Capacity  24 scale 
to classify participants by stage of HD  and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (5 
minute/telephone) .

Aims 2 and 3  include a feasibility study and qualitative interviews. We will include 20

preparation for a future RCT. We will recruit all 20 participants in the feasibility s tudy to 
complete qualitative interviews . All 20 subjects may not want to complete interviews, and  we 
expect that a sample of 10 participants will be sufficient to reach data saturation on qualitative 
analysis  based on Dr. Gibson’s prior experience conducti ng and analyzing qualitative interviews 
in HD .

Answer/Response:  
Main Study:  
Aim 2 : Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patient demographic, health history, and 
user experience variables. Because attrition can be quite high for online mental health 
interventions and CBT -based HD studies 6, 26, we will consider the intervention feasible in PwHD 
if 50% of participants complete at least 50% of the sessions. We will also compare demographic 
and clinical variables between adherers (>50% completers) and non -adherers to provide insight 
into which patients may require targeted retention efforts in a follow -up study (this will be 
done descriptively given small sample size). To evaluate target engagement and preliminary 
efficacy of MindTrails, we will use linear mixed -effects models to assess changes in 
interpretation bias and anxiety symptoms over  the course of the intervention, including age, 
gender, and CAG repeat length as fixed effects . In the case that MDIB is not a valid and reliable

 measure of interpretation bias in HD (Aim 1) , we will use only BBSIQ, and not MDIB, in our 
analysis of  interpr etation bias  for this aim.  Because prior studies have shown potential for CBM -
I to be effective in depressed samples 12, an exploratory mixed effects model will also be used 
to evaluate potential effects of the intervention on depressive symptoms, using the same fixed 
effects. (Note: Analyses for this aim are limi ted by the small, pilot sample, but Dr. Gibson will 
use this feasibility study to develop data analysis skills for this data as well as data for a future 
large RCT. We will focus our interpretation on effect size estimates  given the small sample size 
limits power for significance testing; specifically, effect sizes will be reported as standardized β 
estimates.)  
 
Aim 3 : We will perform qualitative descriptive content analysis of answers, including iterative, 
line-by-line co ding by multiple coders, and organization of findings into categories or themes. 
Qualitative interviews will continue until data saturation is reached, and no new themes are 
identified. Participant responses between disease stage groups will be qualitative ly compared. 
This will help us to determine whether MindTrails is best suited for early -stage (1 -2) HD 
patients as compared to those in later stages (3 -4). The feedback will be used to modify the 
program in an iterative fashion and inform protocol developm ent for a follow -up RCT.

 Mackintosh’s Ambiguous Scenario Training design, a CBM -I protocol with established 
efficacy in trait anxious samples, which trains participants to assign more benign 
interpretations to ambiguous, anxiety -relevant situations 7, 9. 
 
 In each session, participants will read and resolve a series of 40 ambiguous scenarios 
(from a pool of 200 scenarios, see Figure 1  and demo training session: 
http://mt.sartography.com/demo/# /training/1  ). Participants will be asked to imagine 
themselves in each scenario, as previous work has highlighted the strengthening effect 
of imagery on interpretation training 27. Ninety percent of scenarios will end with a word 
fragment that resolves the ambiguity of the scenario in a benign (a nxiety -incongruent) 
manner. Once participants correctly complete a word fragment, they will answer a 
comprehension question, which ensures that they read the scenario and reinforces the 
positive interpretation of the scenario. They will then move on to the  next scenario. 
Later sessions will make the task slightly more challenging by having word fragments 
missing 2 letters, rather than only 1 16.

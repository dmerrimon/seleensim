1.  Introduction  
The purpose of this clinical study protocol is to gather information regarding the 
performance and safety of a novel time lapse incubator compared to standard 
incubator systems.  The MIRI -TL and the Culture Coin are CE Marked and have 
therefore fulfilled EU safety and performance criteria. In the US, 510( k) 
submission for both products is planned for Q2/Q3  2016.  
As the sponsor of this clinical study, ESCO Medical has the overall responsibility 
for the conduct of the study, including assurance that the study will be performed according to the clinical inves tigation plan, applicable US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and local regulation.  
2.   Background  
The optimal goal of IVF should be the delivery of a healthy singleton baby and 
healthcare providers may be compelled via legal, financial, and moral 
obligations to reduce multiple pregnancies.1-4  The clinical dilemma is how to 
restrict the number of embryos for transfer to prevent multiple births while at 
the same time maintaining or improving IVF success rates. The ability to selecting the h ighest quality embryo that is most likely to result in implantation 
becomes the key  solution, however, this has proven to be challenging.  
In the late 1990s, improved culture media enabled blastocyst culture, allowing 
embryos to develop in a petri dish for 2 to 3 additional days. Generally, about 40% of the embryos will form a blastocyst while others arrest in the culture dish during this extended period of incubation. It was broadly reported that blastocyst formation was a key embryo selection criterion for predicting successful implantation. Papanikolaou et al demonstrated in prospective 
randomized studies that embryo implantation rates and live birth rates were 
significantly improved with Day 5 transfer, as compared to Day 3 transfer.
5-6 
Because of improved implantation and live birth rates, blastocyst culture was 
widely  adopted  in  clinics,  in  particular  those  which  utilized  single embryo 
transfer.  
 
Embryos selection based on traditional morphology scores developed in the 
early 1980s. The morphological criteria are based on multiple 'static' 
observations of embryos under regular light microscopes. This involved removing the culture dish, which contained the embryos, from the incubator on a daily 
basis and assessing the embryos based on their morphology and growth.   A number of studies have reported observations relating embryo morphology and implantation, including 2 -pronuclear score, early cleavage observation, Day 2 or 
TiMMI  Study  
2016 -TiMMI -001  Confidential   
 Day 3 cleaved embryo assessments, and Day 5 or Day 6 blastocyst  grading.7-24 
 
However, despite exhaustive efforts by clinical embryologists using a regular 
light microscope to assess embryo quality, it is clear that traditional morphology 
grading, which only captures static images at a few time points, is of limited 
predictive value.  
Several studies have indicated that using information obtained from time -lapse 
imaging, which provides a continuous 'movie' of embryo d evelopment,  may 
improve embryo selection and ultimately improve clinical pregnancy or 
implantation.25-27 This is partly due to the non- invasive and controlled micro 
environment most purpose built time -lapse incubators provide. The literature 
has been enco uraging as it appears that using time -lapse in the IVF laboratory 
may have a significant positive impact by providing embryologists with an 
additional tool to assess and predict which embryo is more likely to lead to a 
successful pregnancy.  
 
3.    Study  Objectives  
The purpose of this clinical study is to demonstrate and validate the safety and 
efficacy of the purpose built MIRI -TL incubator and correlate morphokinetic data 
to improved success rates.

4. Description of  Device  
The Miri - TL, manufactured by the study sponsor Esco  Medical is a closed -system 
incubator device with built- in visual monitoring system.   This closed sys tem 
incubation system eliminates  any environmental disruption and contamination risk by 
daily handling.  The built -in camera has the ability to record cell division kinetics and 
morphology of developing embryos which can provide more reliable indicators of 
embryo quality.  This novel time -lapse incubator captures images at five (5) minute 
intervals and its six (6) separate incubation chambers maximizes temp erature and gas 
stability, providing a safe and secure environment for human embryos.

4.1 CultureCoin  
The 16- well CultureCoin ( Figure 2 ) is a standard size (60mm) embryo culture dish 
with individual micro - wells aligned in a row in the center of the dish. Each micro -
well is designed to accommodate a single patient’s oocytes or developing 
embryos through the blastocyst stage and are culture individually. The 16 -well 
Culture Coin is designed to fit in only one (1) position in one (1) of the individual 
six (6) incubator chambers, and each micro -well is identified to facilitate embryo 
tracking (for example,  micro -well

5. Number of Centers and Study  Duration  
The TiMMI study will include only one investigational site. This site will conduct 
the study under a single clinical investigation  plan.  
Expected study duration is 18 months incl uding enrollment and follow -up. 
Subjects will be followed until pregnancy outcome has been determined (i.e. 
date of negative hCG test or 8 -12 week clinical pregnancy ultrasound, if 
pregnant).  
 
6. Study  Design  
This is a prospective, non-blinded, observation al, randomized, double -arm study.  
 
7. Statistical Methods and  Analyses  
Up to 5 00 subjects’ embryos will be collected in this ongoing data collection 
protocol.  We aim to recruit 200 patients in the standard culture group, and 300 
patients in the MIRI -TL group.  
Assuming that 25 % of all inseminated oocytes would develop into blastocysts 
(based on published clinical data), at least 1300 inseminated oocytes  (~163 
patients)  would be n eeded in each group to detect an increase in blastocyst  
proportion of 20% with 80% power and a significance level of 0.05 (two -tailed 
tests).   
Assuming that time from insemination to start of blastulation (tSB) follows a 
normal distribu tion, and is 96h with a variance of 49h in euploid embryos, and 
98h (variance 49h) in aneuploid embryos , ~405 blastocysts (1620 inseminated 
oocytes = 203 patients) in the MIRI -TL group will need to be biopsied to detect 
a significant difference in tSB  (80%  power, 0.95 confidence level, 2 -tailed test) . 
Since ~80% of all patients receive PGS at our clinical site, we will need ~255 patients in our MIRI -TL group.  
To account for patient dropout and lower than expected oocyte retrieval per patient, we propose to recruit up to 500 subjects in this ongoing data collection 
protocol: 200 patients in the standard culture (SC) group and 300 patients in 
the MIRI -TL (MIRI) group.  
Embryos with incomplete annotations will be excluded from analysis. All 
variables will be tes ted for normality using Shapiro –Wilks test. Continuous data 
following a normal distribution will be  analyzed with Students t -test. 
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 Continuous data not fulfilling the assumption of normality will be  analyzed with  
non-parametric tests such as the  Wilcoxon rank -sum test. For categorical data 
Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test will be  used. Two -tailed p -values < 0.05 will 
be considered significant.  
 
8. Study Protocol  
8.0 Patient Randomization  
Patients will be randomized to the MIRI -TL group  (MIRI ) or the Standa rd culture 
group  (SC) by randomization number generator through www.randomizer.org , 
using a number set from 1 to 500.  Numbers  1-300 will be assigned to the study 
(MIRI -TL) group while numbers  301-500 will be assigned to the control (Standard 
Incubator).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.1 Egg Retrieval and Fertilization -Day 0 
Egg retrieval and fertilization follow the standard protocol in place at the clinical 
site. Insemination, by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) will take  place on 
Day 0 (egg retrieval day)  following standard protocol currently in place at the 
clinical site.  The fertilized eggs should be free of cumulus cells as much as 
possible. If the cumulus cells remain in place, they may interfere with the quality of the imaging.  Immediately after micro insemination, eggs will be placed in 
individual wells within a CultureCoin (MIRI group), or a s tandard culture dish (SC 
group), and incubated in the MIRI -TL or standard incubator respectively.  All eggs 
will be cultured in the standard fertilization  media currently in place at the 
clinical site. At 20hr after insemination,  the MIRI -TL imaging software will be 
Paused, and  all embryos will be examined by the embryologist for successful 
fertilization (2PN) . All normally fertilized eggs will be placed into a new 
CultureCoin (MIRI group) or standard culture dish (SC group) containing the  
standard embryo culture media, and incubated in the MIRI -TL or standard 
incubator respectively . 
Once an embryo is assigned a micro -well locatio n, it must remain in the same 
location throughout the study imaging period. Embryos  assigned to the MIRI 
group  will be imaged  in the CultureCoin  from Day 0 to Day 7. Images of the 
developing embryos will automatically be captured with the MIRI -TL Microscope. 
Data collected will include the  following:  
• Number of eggs  inseminated  
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 • Fertilization  method  
• Total number of fertilized eggs  (2PN)  
 
8.2   Day 3 Embryo  Assessment  
At Day 3, t he MIRI -TL imaging software will be Paused and the embryologist will 
evaluate embryos  from both groups  per standard procedure. The development 
stage of the embryos and grading based on traditional morphology criteria will 
be recorded. It is recommended that the Day 3 morphology assessment is done 
within 48 hours after the fertilization (2PN) check. Per protocol, Assisted Hatching (AH) is allowed if patients have opted for embryo biopsy and PGS.  
After embryo assessment the embryos may be placed back into the MIRI -TL or 
standard incubator as per their respective groups,  and imaging will be resumed  
for the MIRI group.  
8.3 Day 5, 6 and 7 Embryo  Assessment  
The embryologist will evaluate the embryos using traditional morphological 
grading. It is recommended that the Day 5 morphology assessment is done 
within 48 hours after the Day 3 morphology assessment.  
 
8.4 Embryo Biopsy and Preimplantation Genetic Screening Data - if applicable  
Pre-implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) is not required in this study. If the 
physician and the patient have previously decided to perform PGS in the IVF 
cycle, the outcome data will be collected. Embryo biopsy and PGS will be 
performed per standard procedure. Transfer procedures and disposition of 
embryos not selected for transfer will be determined as per the standard protocol in place at the time of the study.  
8.5 Embryo  Transfer 
Embryo(s) will be selected for transfer based on  the current standard protocol in 
place at the clinical site. Data pertaining to the embryo transfer procedure will include the  following:  
• Day and date of transfer  
• Total number of embryos  transferred  
• Luteal phase  support  
 
8.6 Outcome: Pregnancy  Test  
After embryo transfer, each subject will be followed to determine if a chemical 
pregnancy has been achieved by undergoing the clinical sites’ standard serum pregnancy testing procedure.  Data will be recorded and include the  following:  
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 • Date of the serum pregnanc y test 
• Quantitative hCG  level  
 
Each subject with a positive serum pregnancy test result will continue to be 
followed. If the result of the pregnancy test is negative, the subject will have 
completed the study and be exited at that time.  
8.7 Outcome: Pregna ncy Confirmation  Ultrasound  
A clinical pregnancy is typically verified by the detection of a fetal heartbeat via vaginal ultrasound. The clinical site verifies clinical pregnancy at approximately 5 - 
8 weeks gestation. The results of the test will be recorded and include the following:  
• Date of  ultrasound  
• Result of initial pregnancy  ultrasound  
o Number of intrauterine gestational  sacs 
o Number of fetal heart beats  
 
If the result of the ultrasound is negative, that is, if no fetal heartbeat is 
detected, then the subject will have completed the study and be exited at that 
time.  
8.8 Outcome: Ongoing Pregnancy  Ultrasound  
The clinical site verifies the viability of the pregnancy (ongoing pregnancy) at approximately 8 -12 weeks gestational age via vaginal ultrasound. Data will be 
recorded and include the  following:  
• Date of  ultrasound  
• Result of  ultrasound  
o Number of gestational  sacs 
o Number of fetal  heartbeats  
• Pregnancy  outcome  
 
If the result of the ultrasound is negative, that is, if an ongoing pregnancy is not 
confirmed, then the subject will have completed the study and be exited at that 
time.  
8.9 Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET) Cycles –  if applicable  
If the patient does not get pregnant from the fresh embryo transfer, data from 
blastocysts previously frozen in the fresh cycle may be thawed for a FET for the 
duration of the study. Endometrial preparation for FET cycles will be performed 
per the clinical sites standard protocol. Data pertaining to the stimulation protocol, pregnancy, and outcome data will be  collected.  
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 8.10  Protocol  Deviations  
A protocol deviation occurs when a clinical investigator and/or study site 
personnel does not conduct the study according to the clinical investigation plan. 
All deviations are recorded on the Protocol Deviation case report form. Data collected will include the  following:  
• Date of deviation  
• Type of  deviation  
• Description of deviation  
• Corrective  action  
 
The Investigator must maintain accurate, complete, and current records relating 
to the clinical study. This includes source documents showing the dates and 
reasons for each deviation from the clinical investigation plan.  
   
 
  
8.11 Device  Incidents  
Any feedback in regards to the Miri - TL should be reported to Esco Global as 
soon as possible. Feedback may consist of any alleged deficiency  related to the 
physical characteristics, identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness, or performance of the MIRI -TL and/or CultureCoin. Engineering 
and Quality will investigate device deficiencies and perform an evaluation to 
determine and document the root cause of any device deficiency. Reports will be 
filed in the MIRI -TL Study project file and/or in document control.   The following 
data will be  collected:  
 
• Date and time incident first observed  
• Associated  Device(s) 
• Description of  incident  
• Troubleshooting  
• Outcome  
 
8.12 Adverse  Events  
While the overall IVF procedure may involve several visits and procedures, the first time the subject or user has any encounter with the MIRI -TL and CultureCoin 
is when the embryos are first loaded onto  the MIRI -TL for imaging. Adverse 
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 events for the subject or user will be reported from the point of embryos being 
placed in the MIRI -TL through study completion for each subject. An adverse 
event will be followed until resolved or stabilized at a level acc eptable to the 
investigator.  
Events well documented to be associated with ART/IVF procedures (as outlined 
in each clinic’s consent for IVF procedures) will not be collected as adverse events under this protocol. Other common non- study or non- device related , 
minor health complaints will not be collected as adverse events (for example: 
colds, sprains,  headaches).  
The investigator should follow the reporting requirements of the reviewing IRB/REB for all adverse events (including serious and unanticipated adver se 
device effects). Documentation of any IRB and Esco Global notifications should 
be maintained in the site’s clinical study files. It is recommended that 
acknowledgement of receipt from the IRB be maintained in the study file as well.  
Adverse events will be reported to Esco Global and data collected will include 
the following:  
• Date of adverse  event  
• Type of event and  description  
• Action/treatment taken 
• Severity of  event  
• Seriousness of  event  
• Investigator’s assessment as to the relationship of the AE to the MIRI -
TL 
• Investigator’s assessment as to the relationship of the AE to IVF/ART 
procedures  
Investigator’s assessment if the event is a potential Unanticipated 
Adverse Device Effect  (UADE) 
 
Source documentation for adverse events must be collected and filed w ith the 
subject’s medical chart. Refer to Section 10 – Adverse Event Definitions and 
Reporting for additional information. Because study procedures are limited to 
the noninvasive collection of clinical data, no Data Safety Monitoring Board will 
be establis hed for this  study.  
8.13 Study  Exit 
Study Exit data should be collected at the time a subject is exited from the study. 
A subject will be considered to have exited from the study for any of the 
following reasons including, but not limited to: 
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 • Subject completed follow -ups required by the clinical  protocol  
• IVF cycle not completed or  cancelled  
• Subject requested to be  withdrawn  
• Subject terminated IVF treatment for personal  reasons  
• No availability of culture slots in the MIRI -TL  
• Investigator requested that subject be withdrawn to protect the 
welfare of the  subject  
• Subject was lost to  follow -up 
• Subject was not  compliant  
• Other  (specify) 
 
A subject may elect to withdraw from the study at any time. The subject should 
notify the investigator if she wishes to withdraw from the study.  The 
investigator and research staff should encourage all subjects to return for required follow -up visits. The investigator is free to withdraw a subject at any 
time if, in the investigator’s opinion, it is in the best medical int erest of the 
subject. A subject so withdrawn will be treated according to standard of medical care. The sponsor reserves the right to terminate this study at any time. Subject 
data will be included in the analyses up to the time that consent was withdrawn 
or up to the time that the study was  terminated.  
8.14 Subject  Confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study to the extent 
permitted by law. That is, every attempt will be made to remove subject 
identifiers from study docum ents. For this purpose, a unique subject 
identification code (subject number) will be assigned and used to allow 
identification of all data reported for each subject. A log of subject initials and 
the corresponding subject ID will be maintained to ensure t hat the information 
can be tracked back to the source data. All subject study records and files shall 
be kept in a secure location with limited access. Access shall be granted only to 
those individuals who are recorded as authorized study staff members.  
Study data may be made available to third parties, e.g., in the case of an audit 
performed by regulatory authorities. The identity of a subject will never be 
disclosed in the event that study data are  published.  
 
9. Potential Benefits  
In this study, there is no direct benefit to subjects who participate. However, the data collected in this study may lead to more effective methods of visualizing, monitoring, and selecting the most viable IVF embryos by a physician or 
embryologist, to max imize the chances of implantation and successful pregnancy 
2016 -TiMMI -001 Confidential   
 outcome for future  patients.  
Subjects who successfully complete all study procedures will receive a video of the 
embryo which was transferred or embryo(s) which were cryopreserved.  N o other 
reimbu rsement will be provided for the IVF cycle.

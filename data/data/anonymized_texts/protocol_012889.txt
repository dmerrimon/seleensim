2 Background and Specific Aims  
 
With t he growing elderly population, the number of total shoulder arthroplasty  (TSA)  surger ies is 
increasing. Nationwide, the total and partial shoulder replacements increased from about 18,000 in 2000 to 
over 45,000 in 2013 according to the American Academy of Orthopedic surgeons  (AAOS) . One of the greatest 
drivers of cost following TSA  has been shown to be disch arge disposition . Effective pain control after 
surgery is paramount because  it facilitates rehabi litation and decreases  hospital  length of stay.  Additionally, 
it may increase the likelihood of patient s being discharged to their  home rather tha n a rehabilitation o r 
skilled nursing facility .  
 
TSA  is a procedure that is well confined within the dermatomal distribution of an interscalene  brachial 
plexus nerve block  (ISB) , making it an ideal procedure to both evaluate and compare the regional potential  
of varying agents. Although the analgesic coverage is typically ideal , single shot injection  of the long  acting

local anesthetics , such as Bupivacaine , is limited in duration to the first postoperative day. Conversely, while 
interscalene  perineural cathet ers offer the ability to continuously provide analgesia, they are  time 
consuming to place, require  daily maintenance, and often dislodge or migrate from the desired position.   
These limitations make  interscalene perineural  cathe ters  problematic .  In order to offer the longevity of an 
appropriately positioned cathe ter while preserving the simplicity  of a single injection nerve blockade, this 
group proposes to evaluate the efficacy of liposomal bupiva caine or Exparel ® in the setting of TSA.    
 
Exparel ® is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, preservative -free liposomal formulation of bupiva caine that provides a 
non-opioid option for postoperative pain control for up to 72 hours with single shot injection into the 
perineural space.  The chemical and pharmacological nature of Exparel ® allows for the encapsulated 
Bupiva caine to extend its duration of local anesthe tic action by delaying medication release  as compared to 
the injection of plain Bupivacaine . The FDA has recently approved  Exparel ® in its use for shoulder surgery 
via the interscalene nerve block . Exparel ® has shown great potential with both its analgesic benefits and 
side effect profile; however, adequately powered trials are still necessary in order to compare its ben efits t o 
that of standard Bupiva caine.  
 
To date, only one study has been published comparing bupivacaine alone to bupivacaine plus liposomal 
bupivacaine (1). In that study, the reduction in pain scores was minimal. However, there are several 
methodological issues  with that study: 0.25% bupivacaine was used rather than 0.5%, resulting in a nerve 
block that was less dense, and making it mandatory to use general anesthesia; the study was probably 
underpowered; and analgesic use was not quantified.  
 
2.1 Specific Aims  
AIM 1:  To determin e if Liposomal bupivacaine added to 0.5 % bupivacaine HCL in the interscalene nerve 
block during TSA  surgery significantly  changes post -operative opioid  usage  during the initial 72 hours  post -
operative period . This will be evaluated by randomizing patients to either receive 0.5% Bupi vacaine  HCL or  
Bupi vacaine 0.5% with Liposomal bupivacaine  in the interscalene nerve block . Opioid consumption will be 
evaluated in  the immediate  post -operative period , up to 72 hours post op  and for  up to  4 weeks after 
surgery . 
 
AIM 2:   To determine if the addition of Liposomal bupivacaine to B upivacaine 0.5% in an interscalene nerve 
block prolongs post -operative nerve block and hence reduces post -operative pain  from during the initial 72 
hour post -operative period.   Usin g the same groups as above, the patient stated d uration of block  (record 
time of onset of pain)  and p ost-operative  VAS  Pain scores will be recorded in both  the hospital and 
outpatient settings.  Physical therapy endpoints will also be monitored and recorded.  
 
2.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
We hypothesize that  adding Liposomal bupivacaine  to Bupivacaine 0.5% for the interscalene  nerve  block 
prior to TSA surgery will prolong the sensory block and  reduce post -operative pain and opioid  usage not 
only during the patients’ inpatient hospita l stay but also after discharge from the hospital for u p to 72 hours . 
Furthermore,  combining Liposomal bupivacaine  and Bupivacaine  will reduce complications associated with 
opioids such as constipation, nausea, pruritus , ileus and  opioid  dependency. Failing to reject the null 
hypothesis would signify that E xparel® has no clinically relevant impact on post -operative outcomes in TSA  
surgery  as compared to plain Bupivacaine .  
2.2 Objectives and Purpose  
The  goal o f this study is to determine the effectiveness of Liposomal bupivacaine at reducing opioid 
consumption from 24 -72 hours when used along with Bupivacaine 0.5% for single shot ISB for total 
shoulder arthro plasty . In addition, we w ould also like to determine if Liposomal bupivacaine  is effective at  
prolonging the sensory block and reducing post -operative pain in patients after TSA surgery. We would also

like to determine how  reduction in post -operative pain impacts a patient’s hospital stay in the short term .  
Primary outcomes measures will be opioid utilization (in morphine milligram equiva lents [MME])  during a 
72-hour post -operative period .  Secondary outcomes include patient  reported  pain scores , VAS .  While it is 
expected that the greatest benefit of Liposomal bupivacaine  plus Bu pivacaine  0.5% will be seen within  24-
72 hours  after surgery , it is possible that there will be in an overall  reduction in long -term opioid  use (up to 
4 weeks) . Secondarily, function/rehabilitation, length of stay, and complications may be impacted by 
combined use of Liposomal bupivacaine plus Bupivac aine 0.5% . 
 
3 Study Design  and Endpoints  
 
ARM 1: Experimental  Sample Size:  
92 10 mL Bupivacaine 0.5%  
+ 
10 mL Liposomal Bupivacaine  
 
ARM 2:  Control  Sample Size:  
92 20 mL Bupivacaine 0.5%  
 
 
3.1 Description of Study Design  
 
PRE -SCREENING PHASE /CONSENTING PHASE : 
Surgeons will inform eligible patient s of the study during their pre -surgical visit in their office.  The surgeons 
will use an IRB -approved recruitment flyer to help explain the study to the eligible patient. If the patient is 
agreeable, a member of the research team will provide further details and ask the patient to participate  on 
day of surgery.  Inform ed consent will be obtained on DOS when the patient is in the pre -operative holding 
room by an authorized research member.  
 
BASELINE ASSESSMENTS:  
After informed consent has been obtai ned, participants will complete a total of 3 PROMIS assessments 
(Upper Extremities, Pain Intensity and Global Physical Health) before undergoing their TSA surgery.  
 
RANDOMIZATION PHASE:  
Subjects scheduled to undergo TSA  will be rand omized to either the Bupi vacaine  0.5%  plus Liposomal 
bupivacaine  Or Bupi vacaine  0.5% group. Randomization of each subject will be done on day of surgery using 
randomization.com software to generate the assignment.  
 
TREATMENT PHASE:  
Subjects in the Bupi vacaine  plus Liposomal bupivacaine  group  will receive an in terscale ne nerve block with 
10mL 0.5% Bupivacaine and 10mL  of Liposomal bupivacaine . The co ntrol group will receive an int erscalene  
nerve  block with 20mL 0.5% Bupi vacaine  HCL . The anesthesiologist  will NOT  be blinded to what solution is 
being injected, as liposomal bupivac aine is a white fluid while bupivacaine is clear . All other stakeholders 
(patient, surgeon, other caregivers, and research staff collecting the data) will be blinded to the patient ’s 
group assignment.  
 
POST -OPERATIVE PHASE:  
After initial recruitment, subjects’ pain will be assessed via vi sual analog scale (VAS) by nursing  staff during  
the post -operative period  as per standard of care . The VAS pain score s are collected and documented i n the 
patient’s electronic medical record . Additionally, a  standardized regimen of pain medication will be given to 
all subjects who are enrolled.  The pain medications given to patients are standard  of care medications and 
vary based on pain level . The clinical staff determines this  for each patie nt.

Interventional Template Version: 28 APR 2017  
Occupational and physical t herapy progress and activity  goals  will be reviewed . As per standard of care, 
motor testing of the operated shoulder and arm will be assessed during these visits . This includes: No 
weight bearing exercises  will be pe rformed  as per surgeon’s instructions  and t he nursing staff will continue 
to obtain VAS  pain  scores.  
 
During the 24 -72 hour post -operative period, research staff will visit the patient while they are in the 
hospital to obtain and verify the pain medication taken. If the patient is discharged before the 72 -hour 
period, the research  staff will give the patient a copy of a medication record diary to complete. Additionally, 
the staff member will call the patient  within 1 -2 business days  to obtain th e remaining opioid utilization 
information.  
 
After discharge , the research staff wi ll continue to follow up with the patient on POD 7, POD 14 and POD 30  
to assess pain scores , opioid usage  patterns , and functional status. The pain intensity PROMIS assessment 
will be administered during each phone call. Additionally, on POD 30, participants will complete the Upper 
Extremity PROMIS form. Research staf f will verify documented opioid refills through Epic and pharmacy 
records.

will explai n the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants 
will receive a verbal explanation suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, potential risks 
and their rights as research participants. Partic ipants will have the opportunity to carefully review the 
written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants will have the opportunity to 
discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will 
sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. The 
participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the signed

informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the 
participants will be protected by emphasizing that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely 
affected if they decline to participate in this study.  
 
A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the patient, placed in the patient’s 
electronic medical record  and the original copy will be stored in the research regulatory binder.   Any 
alteration to the standard consent process (e.g.  use of a translator, consent from a legally authorized 
representative, consent document presented orally, etc.) and the justification for such alteration will 
likewise be documented.  
 
Subject Capacity  
All subjects will be assessed for capacity to give in formed consent. Capacity will be assessed through the 
subjects’ ability to express understanding of the information presented to them, their ability to express a 
choice, their appreciation of how this is relevant to them, and reasoning about how the study might impact 
them and others.  
 
Subject/Representative Comprehension  
The subject themselves will have to clearly state back the basic goals of the study (i.e. to look at the effect of 
diffe rent local anesthe tics on post op pain after total shoulder replace ment surgery ) and state that they are 
willing to participate. This may be done in English or in their primary language with an interpreter.  
 
If a subject requests information regarding opting out of further recruitment for all research, subjects will be 
directed to contact r esearch coordinator , Randy Cuevas  at 212-598-6085 . 
 
4.5 Duration of Study Particip ation  
While  the study will be open for 3  years after beginning enrollment , the actual length of a study subject’s 
participation is four  weeks.  
4.6 Total Number of Participants  and Sites  
Recruitment will end when approximatel y 184  participants are enrolled. It is expected that approximately  
184 participants will be enrolled in order to produce  146 evaluable participants.  The only site for 
enrollment will be the NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital.  
 
4.7 Participant Withdrawal or Termination  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An inv estigator 
may terminate participation in the study if:  
 
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) 
that precludes further study participation  
 
4.8 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI will promptly inform the IRB and will provide 
the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  
Circumstances that may warrant termin ation or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
1. Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants ; 
2. Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping ;

4. Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable ; or 
5. Determination of futility  
5 Risks and Benefits  
5.1 Potential Risks  
Bupivacaine used for this study is  the standard of care  for ISB . Liposomal Bupivacaine  (EXPAREL ®), a 
second  study drug, has recently been approved by the FDA for use in interscalene blocks . 
 
The potential risks associated with bupivacaine include neurologic and cardiac toxicity, if injected 
intravascularly. However, the risk is very low because a trained anesth esiologist using ultrasound guidance 
will perform the nerve block . This allows the anesthesiologist to see and avoid blood vessels when 
administering the medication.  Additionally, the syringe of the local anesthetic will be aspirated prior to 
injection to ensure that the block needle tip is not intravascular.  
 
The use of Liposomal Bupivacaine or Exparel ® in this study is experimental and may cause side effects. 
Exparel ® has recently been approved by the FDA to be used in interscalene blocks. The potential risks 
associated with Exparel® include nausea, constipation, and fever. In addition , there can be temporary 
sensory and motor loss, depending on the dosage, site of injection and duration of the nerve block. However, 
the amount (10mL) used in this study me ets FDA dosage -regulations for this medication.  
 
Potential Benefits  
Study  subjects may experience better pain control, improved satisfact ion, decreased need for opioids  and 
reduced incidence of  side effects. If the study is not inconclusive, the study’s results may benefit future 
patients b y showcasing that  Liposomal Bupivacaine  improves  pain control beyond 2 4hours in an ISB.   
Additionally,  advocate for the use of Liposomal Bupivacaine as the  standard of care for peri - and 
postoperative pain contr ol in future patient s undergoing TSA . 
 
6 Statistical Analysis  
6.1 General Approach  
Intent ion-to treat . The prim ary analysi s will follow the intent ion-to-treat ( ITT) principle in order to evaluate 
the true outcome of the intervention as experienced by the patient who is blinded to the intervention.  
 
Missing Data . It is anticipated that the data for some subjects will be incomplete for various reasons:   
missing daily -diary entries,  refusal to answer a sensitiv e question on a questionnaire, onset of illne ss, loss-
to-follow -up, etc. All occurrences of incomplete data will be investigated to carefully document the  reasons 
for the missing data. If the primary outcome (amount of opioid used between 24 and 72 hours after surgery) 
cannot be ascertained with a reasonable degree of certainty, the patient will be excluded from the study.  
 
 
6.2 Analysis of Endpoints  
Primary En dpoints:  
Opioid utilization  (expressed as oral morphine mg equivalents) used  during initial 24-72 hours  post -
operative period after surgery.  
 
Secondary Endpoints:

Interventional Template Version: 28 APR 2017  
Duration of opioid  use 
Patient reported pain scores  (VAS)  
Length of stay  
Progress with physic al therapy  
Reported lo ng-term narcotic use at home   
Discha rge location: home, acute rehab or  skilled nursing facility  
Documented opioid  refills  
Adverse events  such as respiratory depression, hypoventilation, reintubation, nausea, constipation  
 
The analysis of opioid u se, VAS, and PROMIS assessments  will rely o n a univariate  analysis of variance model 
for mean score.   This model is in the class of models commonly known as unirep -ANOVA models.   It assumes 
that the mean score is a function of elaps ed time and the treatment regimen assigned .  This model considers  
the fact that the subject’s repeated measures are correlated.   The fitted model will provide statistical 
estimates of the mean levels, the treatment -effect differences between mean levels, t he standard deviation, 
the intra -class correlation coefficient, 95% CIs,  standard errors (SE), and statistical hypothesis tests.   The 
estimates of means will be used to compute summary criteria such as area under the curve (AUC) for each 
regimen.   All esti mates reported will be presented their 95% CIs.  
 
All endpoints will be evaluated as fits the data set with graphical figures such as scatter plots, box -and-
whisker plots, and frequency histograms to visualize the distribution of these outcomes and their 
relationships to covariates and treatment assignment. When appropriate descriptive graphi cal and tab ular 
methods  will also be estimated and presented in a graphical figure.  
 
6.2.1  Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
The following patient data will be recorded: age, gender, height, weight, date of admission, date of disc harge , 
laterality , surgical approach, implants used, du ration of surgery, contamination , ASA, comorbidities 
(smok ing, cardiac history, diabetes etc.), CBC ( WBC, PCV, HGB, RBC, indices, p latelet count, differential), and 
medications.  All of this information will be accessible in the patient’s medical record.  
 
6.3 Sample Size  
184 subjects will be enrolled  
6.4 Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures  
We will utilize randomization.com  to generate a randomization assignment for all 184 participants. 
Someone  that is not a stakeholder in the study will make randomization envelopes, which include the study 
ID number , the treatment assignment, and dosage specifics . These ra ndomization envelopes will  then  be 
distributed to the anesthesiologist pre -operatively by the authorized researcher after informed consent is 
obtained.  
6.5 Breaking the Study Blind/Participant Code  
If there is any adverse event  related to the drug , we will br eak the blind for the subject and randomization  
will be disclosed to the patient . 
7 Assessment of Safety  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.   Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.   
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be  adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
  Page 16 
CONFIDENTIAL

Interventional Template Version: 28 APR 2017  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 
7.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.   A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal  
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -
patient hospitalization or intensive treatment of  bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typically be considered serious.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet a ny of the criteria for serious will  be regarded as non -serious adverse 
events .  
7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1  Severity of Event  
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.  
 
1. Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
2. Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with func tioning.  
3. Severe  – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
 
7.2.2  Relationship to Study Agent  
The clinician’s assessm ent of an AE's relationship to study agent (drug, biologic, device) is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is 
any doubt as to whether a clinical observ ation is an AE, th e event will  be reported. All AEs must have their 
relationship to study agent assessed. For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the 
participant will determine the AE’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical ju dgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
1. Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, includin g an abnormal laboratory test result, 
occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
2. Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors 
is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable 
  Page 17 
CONFIDENTIAL

Interventional Template Version: 28 APR 2017  
time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent  disease or other drugs or 
chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal ).  
3. Possibly Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors ma y have 
contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although 
an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more 
information and later be upgraded to “proba bly related” or  “defin itely related,” as appropriate.  
4. Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  temporal 
relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the  event did no t occur 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in  which other drugs or 
chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the  participant’s clinical 
condition,  other concomitant treatments).  
5. Not Relat ed – The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence  exists 
that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy 
documented by the clinician.  
 
Dr. Umeh  will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk 
information previously described for the study agent.  
7.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. Al l AEs 
including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate 
RF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), 
and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequ ate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will b e recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout 
the study.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at 
each level of severity to be performed. AEs characteri zed as intermittent require documentation of onset 
and duration of each episode.  
 
The PI will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each 
study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be 
followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.   
 
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the subject 
is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.   At the last scheduled visit, the investigator 
will instruct each subject to re port any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal 
physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   The investigator will notify the 
study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time aft er a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.   The sponsor will also be 
notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in 
a subsequent ly conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.

7.4 Safety Oversight   
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.   This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan . Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
 
8 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.   Sourc e data are contained in source 
documents.   Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, r ecorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as 
being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, 
subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the  laboratories, and at medico -technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.   All data requested 
on the CRF must be recorded.   All missing data must be explai ned.   If a space on the CRF is left blank because 
the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.   If the item is not applicable to the 
individual case, write “N/A”.   All entries will be printed legibly in black ink.  
 
Access to stud y records will be limited to IRB -approved members of the study team. The investigator will 
permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB/EC, the sponsor, government regulatory 
bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance gr oups of all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).   The investigator will ensure 
the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.).  
 
9 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects  
9.1 Ethical Standard  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the 
Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, and/or 
the ICH E6.  
9.2 Institutional Review Board  
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be 
obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and 
approval by the IRB before the changes are implemented to the study. All changes to the consent form will 
be IRB approved; a determinati on will be made regarding whether previously consented participants need 
to be re -consented.  
9.3 Participant and Data Confidentiality  
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, their staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents . Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information 
generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released 
to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.

Interventional Template Version: 28 APR 2017  
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the IRB or 
pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect all documents and records required to be 
maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and 
pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
 
The study participant’s contact information will be securely s tored at each clinical site for internal use 
during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a 
period as dictated by local IRB and Institutional regulations.  
 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be 
transmitted to and stored at NYU Langone Medical Center . This will not include the participant’s contact or 
identifying information. Rather, in dividual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique 
study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by clinical sites and 
by NYU Langone Medical Center  research staff will be secured and password  protected. At the end of the 
study, all study databases will be de -identified and archived at the NYU Langone Medical Center . 
 
To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the 
NIH. This certi ficate protects identifiable research information from forced disclosure. It allows the 
investigator and others who have access to research records to refuse to disclose identifying information on 
research participation in any civil, criminal, administrati ve, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the 
federal, state, or local level. By protecting researchers and institutions from being compelled to disclose 
information that would identify research participants, Certificates of Confidentiality help ach ieve the 
research objectives and promote participation in studies by helping assure confidentiality and privacy to 
participants.  
 
10 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
10.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site PI. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported.  
 
All source documents should be completed  in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copies. When making changes or corrections, 
cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT  ERASE, OVERWRITE, 
OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL.  
 
Copies of the electronic CRF (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and maintained for 
recording data for each participant enrolled in the study. Data reported in the eCRF de rived from source 
documents should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained and 
captured in a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official electronic study record.  
 
Clinical data (including AEs, concomi tant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical 
laboratory data will be entered into Redcap. The data system includes password protection and internal 
quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsis tent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  
 
10.2 Study Records Retention  
Study documents will be retained for the longer of 3 years after close -out, 5 years after final 
reporting/publication, or 2 years af ter the last approval of a marketing application is approved for the drug

for the indication for which it is being investigated or 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA 
is notified if no application is to be filed or if the application ha s not been approved for such indication. No 
records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of 
the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
10.3 Protoco l Deviations  
It is the responsibility of the site PI/study staff to use continuous vigilance to identif y and report deviations 
within 7  working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within 7 working days of the scheduled 
protocol -required activity.  
 
Protocol deviations will be reported to the local IRB per their guidelines. The site PI/study staff is 
responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements.  
 
10.4 Publication and Data Sharin g Policy  
This study will comply with the NIH Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has access to the 
published results of the research. This trial will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov as per t he ICMJE policy, 
and the Section 801 of the Food and Drug Admini stration Amendments Act of 2007 .  
10.5 Data Safety and Monitoring  
The definition of unanticipated problems (UP) involving risk to subjects or others according to the NYU SOM 
IRB Drug Trial Protocol template is any incident, experience or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria: unexpected in nature, severity or frequency, related or possibly related to participation in the 
research, suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm. The definition of an 
adverse drug event according to the NYU SOM IRB Drug Trial Protocol is any symptom, sign, illness or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  
 
The DSMB will be made up of the  Principal Investigator – Uchenna Umeh  M.D. and Co -investig ators - Arthur 
Atchabahian M.D. and  Mandeep Virk M.D. All members of the DSMB are board certified physician s in their 
respective specialties.  
 
The DSMB will review safety data after the first five enrolled subjects and every three months thereafter. All 
unanticipated problems that increase risk to the subjects will be reported to the IRB per NYUSOM IRB policy. 
The time frame for reporting SAE and UP to the DSMB is by telephone within 24 hours of awareness of  the 
event. The time frame for reporting SAE and UP to the IRB is to submit reports promptly but no later than 5 
working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event.  
 
During these meetings, the DSMB will review and analyze any unanticip ated problems or adverse events 
involving risk to the patient including any neurological damage, significant delay in physical therapy 
progress, local anestheti c toxicity or allergic reaction  to Exparel etc.   
 
Specific study stopping points is the occurre nce of a  serious adverse event such as  a severe allergic reaction 
to Exparel. Additionally, a fter 5 patients in each group have completed all study related procedure s, a brief 
safety analysis will be done by the Principal Investigator, Uchenna Umeh  M.D., t o check for evidence of 
systemic local anesthetic toxicity. Events will be reported to the anesthesia department QA.  
 
Additionally, the DSMB will perform an interim safety and data analysis after 50 patients have 
completed all study related visits.

12 Conflict of Interest  Policy  
 
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, such as by the pharmaceutical 
industry,  is critical. Therefore , any actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, 
conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and managed. Furthermore, 
persons who have a perceived conflict of interest wil l be required to have such conflicts managed in a way 
that is appropriate to their participation in t he trial. The study leadership has established policies and 
procedures for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish  a mechanism 
for the management of all reported dualities of interest.  
 
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest with this study (patent ownership, royalties, or financial gain 
greater than the minimum allowable by their institution, etc.) must hav e the conflict reviewed by the NYU 
Langone Conflict of Interest Management Unit (CIMU) with a Committee -sanctioned conflict management 
plan that has been reviewed and approved by the study sponsor prior to participation in this study. All 
NYULMC investigat ors will follow the applicable conflict of interest policies.

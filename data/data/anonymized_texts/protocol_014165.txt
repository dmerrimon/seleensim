Page 6 of 37 Glossary of terms  
Assessment  A procedure used to generate data required by the study  
Control drug  A study treatment  used as a comparator to reduce assessment bias, 
preserve blinding of investigational drug, assess internal study validity, 
and/or evaluate comparative effects of the investigational drug  
Enrollment  Point/time of patient entry into the study; the point at which informed 
consent must be obtained (i.e. prior to st arting any of the procedures 
described in the protocol)  
Investigational drug  The study treatment  whose properties are being tested in the study; this 
definition is consistent with US CFR 21 Section 312.3 and is synonymous 
with “investigational new drug.”  
Investigational treatment  Drug whose properties are being testing in the study as well as their associated placebo and active treatment controls (when applicable). This 
also includes approved drugs used outside of their indication/approved dosage, or that  are tested in a fixed combination. Investigational treatment 
generally does not include other study treatments administered as 
concomitant background therapy required or allowed by the protocol when 
used in within approved indication/dosage  
Medication nu mber  A unique identifier on the label of each study treatment  package which is 
linked to one of the treatment groups of a study.  
Other study treatment  Any drug administered to the patient as part of the required study 
procedures that was not included in the investigational treatment  
Subject Number  (Subject No.)  A unique identifying number assigned to each patient/healthy volunteer 
who enrolls in the study  
Phase  A subdivision of the study timeline; divides stages into smaller functional 
segments such as screening, baseline, titration, washout, etc.  
Premature patient withdrawal  Point/time when the patient exits from the study prior to the planned completion of all study treatment administration and/or assessments; at 
this time all study treatment administ ration is discontinued and no further 
assessments are planned, unless the patient will be followed for progression and/or survival  
Randomization number  A unique treatment identification code assigned to each randomized 
patient, corresponding to a specific  treatment arm assignment  
Stage related to study tim eline A major subdivision of the study timeline; begins and ends with major 
study milestones such as enrollment, randomization, completion of 
treatment, etc.  
Stage in cancer  The extent of a cancer in the body. Staging is usually based on the size of the tumor, whether lymph nodes contain cancer, and whether the cancer 
has spread from the original site to other parts of the body  
Stop study participation  Point/time at which the patient came in for a final  evaluation visit or when 
study treatment  was discontinued whichever is later  
Study treatment  Includes any drug or combination of drugs in any study arm administered to the patient (subject) as part of the required study procedures, including 
placebo and active drug run- ins. 
In specific examples, it is important to judge investigational treatment 
component relationship relative to a study treatment combination; study 
treatment in this case refers to the investigational and non-investigational 
treatments in  combination.  
Study treatment  discontinuation Point/time when patient permanently stops taking study treatment  for any 
reason; may or may not also be the point/time of premature patient 
withdrawal

1.1 Overview of Prostate Cancer  
 
Despite advances in the detection and treatment of prostate cancer, it remains the second most 
common cause of cancer -related deaths in the United States, killing approximately 30,000 
men per  year. Men with high- risk localized prostate cancer (Gleason sum 8 -10, PSA > 20 
ng/mL, clinical sta ge ≥T 3) account for the highest density of prostate cancer deaths and many 
succumb to their disease despite optimal local and systemic treatments (including surgery, 
adjuvant radiation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and chemotherapy), highlighting the 
need for novel prostate cancer therapies  for these patients .   
 
1.2 Overview of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway and its role in cancer   
Smoothened (Smo) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) –like molecule that positively 
regulates the Hedgehog (Hh) signal trans duction pathway. Normally, the activity of Smo is 
repressed by the trans -membrane receptor Patched (PTCH). Upon Hh ligand (Sonic Hh, 
Indian Hh or Desert Hh) binding to PTCH, its inhibitory effect on Smo is attenuated and the 
pathway becomes activated, lead ing to the release of Gli transcription factors from a complex 
of cytosolic inhibitory proteins. Active Gli transcription factors are translocated into the nucleus to induce Hh target genes, which control cell proliferation, survival and differentiation.  
The Hh signaling pathway plays a critical role in the embryonic development and 
homeostasis of many human organs and tissues. Genetic alterations in the Hh pathway are linked to the development of several human tumors ( basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 
medullobl astoma (MB) and rhabdomyosarcoma). Aberrant Hh signaling without evidence of 
genetic defects has also been linked with other tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastro- intestinal tumors, ovarian cancer  and prostate cancer .  The pivot al role of 
Hh pathway in BCC was demonstrated in mice genetically engineered to express mutations of 
PTCH1 and SMO typically seen in human sporadic BCCs ( Daya-Grosjean 2005) .   
1.2.1  Inhibition of Hh pathway by small molecules  
The inhibition of the Hh signaling pathway as a therapeutic approach has increasingly become 
an area of extensive research.  A  number of small- molecule inhibitors of the Hh pathway, via 
smoothened inhibition, have progressed into clinical  trials in a wide variety of cancers.  
Vismodegib (GD C0449; Roche)  has  being evaluated in clinical trials in basal cell carcinoma, 
medulloblastoma (recurrent and refractory in adults and young patients), ovarian cancer, 
advanced pancreatic cancer, advanced sarcoma, advanced breast cancer, advanced esophagea l 
junction and SCLC. Vismodegib is now FDA -approved for use in patients with BCC. XL -139 
(Bristol Myers-Squibb) is currently undergoing testing in combination with chemotherapy in 
SCLC, gastric/esophageal, multiple myeloma and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML ). 
Recently, clinical trials have been initiated with PF -04449913 (Pfizer) and IPI 926 ( Infinity) 
in combination in CML and in metastatic pa ncreatic cancer, respectively.  
The anti -tumor activity of Smo inhibitors ha s recently been demonstrated in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic BCC and recurrent medulloblastoma ( von Hoff et al 2009,  
Scales and Sauvage 2009 , Siu L EORTC -NCI-AACR  2009, Ahnert JR ASCO 2010, Ahnert 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 8 of 37 JR ESMO 2010, Rudin et al ESMO 2010)  and in superficial BCC in patients with Gorlin 
syndrome (De Rie et al 2010 ). Vismodegib is now FDA -approved for patients with BCC 
including Gorlin syndrome. 
 
1.3 Overview of LDE225 and Nonclinical studies  
LDE225 is a potent selective  and orally -bioavailable SMO antagonist  from a novel structural 
class: N-[6-(cis-2,6-dimethylmorpholin -4-yl)pyridine -3-yl]-2-methyl -4’-(trifluoromethoxy) -
1,1’-[biphenyl] -3-carboxamide  diphosphate , currently being tested in clinical trials in patients 
with multiple types of cancer.  
1.3.1  Pharmacodynamics 
LDE225 potent ly inhibits both human and mouse Smo at low nanomolar concentrations (11 
and 12 nM, respectively) in competitive binding in vitro  assays. In a single dose 
pharmacokinetic –pharmacodynamic (PK -PD) study, 20 mg/kg  LDE225 resulted in >90% 
inhibition Gli1 mRNA expression in tumor samples that was sustained for over 24 hrs. Daily 
multiple doses of LDE225 (20 mg/kg QD) caused >90% tumor regression in genetically 
defined in vivo  MB xenograft models characterized by heterozygous deletion of PTCH.  
1.3.2  Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and met abolism  
LDE225 was well absorbed with good oral bioavailability , ranging from 68 to 100% in the 
mous e, rat, dog, and monkey after PO  administration  either in  the form of a solution or a 
phosphate salt suspension. The compound showed low to moderate plasma clearance relative  
to blood flow in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. LDE225 exhibits high protein binding 
(approximately 98% in mouse, rat, dog and human plasma), independent of  concentration. 
The compound was extensively distributed into tissues and  its volume  of distribution (V ss) at 
steady -state was greater than total body water (1.9 -7.0 L/kg). LDE225 exhibited high protein 
binding (approximately 98% in mouse, rat, dog and human plasma), independent of 
concentration. In rats, ~85% of LDE225 related radioactivity was eliminated into the feces, 
and renal excretion was minor, accounting for <3.0% of the administered dose.  
Clearance of LDE225 is primarily hepatic by CYP3A4. LDE225 was extensively 
metabolized, with the major metabolic pathway being via mono - or di -oxygenation, 
demethylation, and oxidation leading to carboxylic acid formation, dealkylation, and 
dehydrogenation monohydroxylation. The elimination of me tabolites is mainly through  bile. 
Studies with human liver microsomes demonstrated that LDE225 is a c ompetitive inhibitor of 
CYP2B6 (IC 50 0.5 µM; Ki 0.045 µM), and CYP2C9 (IC 50 5 µM; K i 1.7 µM), but showed very 
little or no inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or  3A4/5 at concentrations of 
up to 100 µM. No apparent time -dependent inhibition of major CYP450 enzymes was 
observed. LDE225 is neither a substrate nor an  inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) or multi-
resistance protein 2  (MRP2); but it has shown inhibitory effects on breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP), with an estimated IC 50 value of 1.5 µM. The potential of LDE225 and its 
metabolites to undergo covalent binding to cellular macromolecules was found to be low. 
The results of toxicokinetics (TK)  studies with LDE225 indicated that systemic exposure  after 
oral administration , as measured  by C max and AUC, was not linear and in general  was less 
than dose -proportional in both rats and dogs.  There was drug accumulation after once daily 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 9 of 37 repeat oral doses, which was more pronounced and dose -dependent in dogs.  There was an 
apparent gender differ ence in exposure in rats following multiple dosing, with female rats 
exhibiting higher exposure than male rats. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for more 
details on the non- clinical toxicity , toxicokinetics  and safety of LDE225.  
1.3.3  Nonclinical t oxicity and safet y studies  
The majority of adverse effects observed in toxicity studies in growing rats and dogs can be 
attributed to the pharmacologic action of LDE225, and the effects in both species were similar.  The most striking effects of LDE225 , which are consistent with literature reports on 
other Hh pathway inhibitors, were on bone  and consisted of thinning or closure of growth 
plates in the sternum and femur and decreasing proliferating chondrocytes in the chostochondral junction of ribs. In addition, decreases i n bone alkaline phosphatase were 
observed in dogs [Investigator Brochure]. The observations were more pronounced in rats, 
which is a species where the growth plate does not close.  Similar observations have been 
reported for other Smo inhibit ors  in animal studies (e.g. Gli- Luc transgenic mice, IHH 
transgenic mice) includ ing thinning and early closure of the growth plate, shortened bones, 
inhibition of tooth growth and abnormal bone structures, particularly the femur and tibia (Maeda 2007, Kimura 2008).  This is likely due to the role of the Hh pathway in bone 
development, particularly in the early stages of bone formation and growt h (Kimura 2008).  
These effects are not likely to occur in the adult cancer patient population intended for the clinical studies due to the maturity of their skeletal system.  However, it anticipated that Smo 
inhibition may likely affect the development of bones and teeth in growing children. Hence, monitor ing for these effects will be required during therapy with Smo inhibitors  in children. 
Preclinical cardiovascular safety pharmacology data do not in dicate a clinical risk for QTc 
prolongation.  There is also no indication of effects on the central nervous and respiratory 
systems from the preclinical data. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for more details 
on the non- clinical toxicity and saf ety of LDE225.  
 
1.4 Clinical Experience with LDE225  
1.4.1  Clinical safety and efficacy  
  
LDE225 has been evaluated in a first -in-human, phase I, multicenter open- label dose -
escalation study [CLDE225X2101]  in patients with advanced solid tumors  including 
medulloblast oma that have progressed despite standard treatments or have no existing 
therapies. The primary objective was  to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and potential 
efficacy of continuous once daily oral administration. The MTD for once daily administrat ion 
of LDE225 wa s 800 mg. Data provided here are obtained from an active clinical trial 
database; therefore, they are preliminary and may be subject to change upon final QC review.  
As of October, 2012, data were available on 103 patients with cancer who have been treated with LDE225 at dose levels of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 1500, and 3000 mg once daily (QD) and 250, 400 and 750 mg twice daily (BID). Based on the available data, the recommended phase II dose of LDE225 in adults is 800 mg once daily.  
DLTs t hat are characterized by CTC AE grade -3 or - 4 increases in plasma creatin ine 
phosphokinase (CK) were observed at once daily doses ≥ 800 mg and twice daily doses ≥250 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 10 of 37 mg (Table 1 -1). The majority  of the dose -limiting toxicity ( DLT ) events occurred during the 
initial 4-6 weeks of treatment with LDE225, except for three events t hat were observed after 6 
weeks . None of the patients experienced impairment of renal function as a result of this 
toxicity. The DL Ts resolved following discontinuation of LDE225 therapy.

Preliminary antitumor activity and evidence of disease stabilization has been observed with 
LDE225 treatment. Nine (9) adult patients with recurrent MB have been treated in the phase I 
study CLDE225X2101.  Of these, three ( 3) patients achieved confirmed partial tumor 
responses at 200 mg QD (by RECIST), 800 mg QD (by RECIST) and 1500 mg QD (by FDG -
PET)  and remained on treatment for approximately 6, 8 and 10 months, respectively . The 
remaining patients progressed after 1 to 4 months on study therapy (see Table 1 -3).

1.4.2  Clinical p harmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
The preliminary pharmacoki netics (PK) data from the ongoing phase 1 study in patients  with 
advanced solid tumors [CLDE225X2101]  showed that the median time of C max (Tmax) occurs 
2-13 hours (range: 1- 48 hours) after oral dosing. Plasma exposure to LDE225 (C max and 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 12 of 37 AUC 0-168h) after s ingle dos e administration increased dose proportionally from 100 to 400 mg 
and less than dose -proportionally above 400 mg. After repeated once -daily (QD) dosing from 
100 mg to 3000 mg, C max and AUC 0-24h on Cycle 1 Day 15 increased approximately dose -
propor tionally up to 400 mg and less than dose proportionally above 400 mg. After twice -
daily  (BID) administration of LDE225 from 250 mg to 750 mg, C max and AUC 0-12h on Cycle 
1 Day 15 also increased approximately dose -proportionally in this dose range. BID dosin g 
results in higher systemic exposures compared with the equivalent once daily regimen. The 7-
day PK run -in phase implemented in this phase 1 study was not long enough to allow for 
accurate estimation of the half -life using non- compartmental methods. Based on available 
data as of December 8, 2011, steady -state was achieved in a limited number of patients, after 
2 weeks to 6 cycles of repeated dosing with an accumulation ratio of 6-  to 90- fold based on 
Cmin . The estimated effective half -life, calculated based on the C min accumulation from these 
patients , ranged from 4 days to 62 days (median 19 days). The inter -subject coefficient of 
variation for Day 15 AUC and C max is 33 to 106% and 39 to 113%, respectively, across the 
dose range of 100 mg to 3000 mg/day. A t the recommended phase II dose of 800 mg QD, the 
inter-subject coefficient of variation for Day 15 AUC 0-24h and C max is 50.0% and 54.5%, in 18 
and 20 subjects, respectively. Exploratory analyses suggested that the incidence of CK DLT 
increased with both A UC and C max on day 15.  
Analyses of skin punch biopsies taken at baseline and at the end of the first treatment cycle have shown evidence of potent target modulation, as measured by Gli1 mRNA, in a dose - and 
exposure  (C
min)-dependent manner. The available data shows that LDE225 caused ≥ 95% 
mean reduction in Gli1 expression in skin compared with baseline values. The maximum observed inhibition of the target in skin (as measured by Gli1 expression) was observed at 750 mg BID  (see Tabl e 1-5).

1.5 Study purpose and rationale  
 
Discrepancies between preclinical data and clinical observations highli ghts the need to carry 
out phar macodynamic studies of promising cellular pathway inhibito rs before conducting 
large- scale clinical trials for efficacy.   While pre -clinical data suggests a role for LDE225 in 
the inhibition of prostate cancer progression, no clinical study exists which confirms the 
ability of LDE225 to suppress the H edgehog path way in prostate cancer cells  (or benign 
prostate tissue) . 
 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 13 of 37 From a tissue acquisition perspective, the presurgical setting is ideal for the study of novel 
drug effects  on both normal and neoplastic prostate tissues.  In addition, our data (and that of 
other  investigators)  suggest that the H edgehog pat hway is active in men with high -risk 
localized prostate cancer and thus this cohort represents an appropriate population for study of Hh pathway inhibitors.  Specifically, p revious work has suggested  that pathwa ys 
characteristic of metastatic disease might be active in high -grade localized tumors ( Ross et al. 
2011). Expanding on this work, we characterized gene expression profiles from tumors of clinically and pathologically matched men with localized high -grade disease who had no 
preoperative treatment and either experienced rapid metastasis following extirpative surgery 
or no metastases for a 5 -year period. Analysis of functional annotation of differentially 
expressed genes in these two groups demonstrated enric hment for embryonic stem cell 
pathways among the localized tumors of men who would experience metastasis (adjusted P<0.0001) and a 3.7- fold increase in Sonic Hh  expression in these tumors (adjusted P <0.035) .  
These data and that of others suggest  up-regula tion of Hh signaling in localized prostate 
cancer  with metastatic potential ( Tzelepi et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2011).  
 
We believe that com pletion of this pharmacodynamic  (pre-surgical ) trial will guide future use 
of LDE225 in prostate cance r.  Furthermore, knowl edge of molecular responses to H edgehog 
signaling inhibition in prostate cancer could help better select patients  and the timing  for 
treatment with LDE225 or with combination therapies.  
 
2 Objectives  and E ndpoints  
 
We pro pose to determ ine the effects of LDE225 on neoplastic prostate tissue from men at 
high risk of systemic disease progression, by comparing pre -surgical core- biopsy specimens 
to tumor tissue  harvested at the time of prostatectomy .  In addition to assaying drug- related 
on-target effects (i.e. GLI expression changes) we pro pose to determine the effects of Smo 
inhibition on the prostate cancer transcriptome.  
Primary Objective  
 
(1) To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of LDE225 on resected prostate 
tissue fr om men underg oing radical prosta tectomy for high -risk localized prostate 
cancer  (as measured by reductions in Gli1  mRNA expression). 
Secondary Objectives  
 
(1) To determine whether presurgical treatment with LDE225 can exert a pathological 
effect on high -risk tumors ( i.e. increase apoptosis, decrease proliferation) .  
 
(2) To evaluate whether presurgical treatment with LDE225 diminishes the risk of PSA 
recurrence following prostatectomy.  
 
(3) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LDE225 in the presurgical setting.  
Exploratory Objectives  
(1) To evaluate ge nome -wide mRNA expression changes in prostate cancer induced by 
LDE225 exposure. 
The o bjectives and  related endpoints are summarized  in the  Table below.

3.1 Overview and  study design  
 
This pharmacodynamic/phase 0 trial is designed as a randomized two -arm (LDE225 vs. 
observation groups ) open -label prospective clinical trial in men with localized high -risk 
prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.   
 
Activation of the Hedgehog pathway is most reliably indicated by increased expression of the 
GLI1  transcription factor.  Qua ntitiative RT -PCR (qRT -PCR) provides the most reliable 
means to assess changes in GLI1  expression upon exposure to drug and will be used as our 
primary readout. Our intent will be to examine the fold change in GLI1  expression in each 
man follo wing exposure  to drug (comparing pre -operative needle biopsy tissue to surgical 
tissue obtained from the same man’s prostatectomy specimen).   Because the effects of surgery 
and fluctuations in hedgehog signaling in the prostate are unknown, GLI1 expression will also be compared between biopsies and prostatectomy specimens for men without drug exposure.  
As treatment with LDE225 may alter the gene expression of other Hedgehog pathway members and affect separate signaling pathways , as an exploratory goal , we will perform 
genome -wide expression analysis using the GeneChip Human Exon 1.0ST Array 
(Affymetrix) and will confirm fluctuations in selected genes of interest.  
 
High -risk patients will be identified based on their core- needle biopsy features, PSA levels, 
and clinical  stage. Eligible men ( NCCN high -risk (Gleason sum > 8, or PSA >20 or clinical 
stage >T3 with no evidence of metastatic disease) will undergo a repeat prostate biopsy  at 
Johns Hopkins with multiple (up to 12) cores taken from the area of their primary lesion. This 
tissue will  be frozen fresh and used for analysis of Gli1  mRNA expression  and array analysis  
as well as mounted for pathological analysis and IHC analysis of proliferation (Ki -67) and 
apoptosis (cleaved caspase- 3) markers . 
 
After obtaining baseline laboratory and clinical values (including an ECG, PSA, hematologic , 
and renal and hepatic panels), men will receiv e oral LDE225 800 mg /day or observation daily 
for 4 weeks (±3 days) prior to prostatectomy. Patients will have a clinical visit and an ECG 
and laboratory testing will be performed at 2 weeks and then again at 4 weeks, including a 4 -
week pre- prostatectomy measurement of PSA and a blood sample to deter mine plasma 
LDE225 levels by LC -MS/MS. Previous studies using other oral Hedgehog inhibitors indi cate 
that 4 weeks will allow time for steady -state levels of drug in the plasma and for inhibition of 
Gli1 expression ( LoRusso et al. 2011).  
Men will undergo radical prostatectomy ( with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy  as 
appropriate) , at which point two 250- mg biopsies of prostate tissue will be obtained, frozen 
and stored for analysis ( including Gli1  expression, genome -wide expression analysis, intra -
prostatic LDE225 levels, Ki -67, and  cleaved caspase- 3) with the remainder of the prostate 
tissue then being formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) and cross -sectioned for analysis 
as per our standard institutional procedures. 
 
Relative fold -changes in mRNA expression of Gli1 will be determined by first normalizing 
input amounts of the pre operative biopsy and prostatectomy biopsies to the housekeeping 
gene HPRT1. IHC comparisons between diagnostic biopsy specimens and prostatectomy 
specimens will be made by calculating  immunoreactivity scores (stain ing intensity × 
percentage cell involvement).  
 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 16 of 37 All men will re ceive routine post -operative care, and in addition will have ultrasensitive PSA 
testing at 1 and 2 months post -op followed by standard PSA tes ting at the  3 month visit.  
 
Study Schema  
3.1.1  Investigational treatment  
The investigational study drug used in this t rial is LDE225, which is supplied as oral capsules.  
3.1.2  Treatment arms  
This will be a randomized 2- arm trial.  A rm 1 will receive LDE225 by mouth 800 mg daily 
for 4 weeks ( + 3 days) ;  Arm 2  will receive no treatment (observation)  prior to prostatectomy . 
3.1.3  Treatm ent duration  
Patients will continue on LDE225 therapy  for 4 weeks ( ±3 days)  in Arm 1 , or until they 
experience a treatment toxicity requiring discontinuation.  
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 17 of 37 3.1.4  Treatment assignment/randomization 
Patients will be randomized ( 1:1) to treatment with LDE225 or observation, with a total 
sample size of 22 patients ( i.e. 11 per group ). 
 
3.2 Rationale for the study design  
 
Discrepancies between preclinical data and clinical observations highlight  the need to carry 
out pharmacodynamic studies of promising cellular pathwa y inh ibitors before conducting 
large- scale clinical trials for efficacy.  While pre -clinical data suggests a role for LDE225 in 
the inhibition of prostate cancer progression, no clinical study exists which confirms the 
ability of LDE225 to suppress the H edgehog pathway in prostate cancer .  For this reason, we 
believe that a phase 0 ( pharmacodynamic)  trial would be instrumental in  determining whether 
further larger clinical studies should be carried out with LDE225 in prostate cancer.    
 
From a tissue acquis ition perspective , a pre -surgical trial involving b iopsy tissue collection 
and tissue  at prostatectomy would be ideal for determining whether LDE225 has effects on its 
in vivo  target and  additionally to measure genome -wide alterations caused by drug exposu re.  
 
Based on our pre -clinical data (and that of other groups)  we believe that men with NCCN high 
risk prostate cancer are the best candidates for this trial  due to relative enrichment in baseline 
Hedgehog pathway activation in this subgroup ( Ross et al. 2011, Tzelepi et al. 2011, Chen et 
al. 2010, Kim et al. 2011).  Becau se the temporal variability of H edgehog pathway activity 
and the effects of surgical treatment on pathway activation are largely unkn own, we believe 
that a control/ observation arm is critical to the study.

5 Treatment  
5.1 Treating the patient  
The treating investigator needs to instruct the patient to take the study drug as  per protocol . 
All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and any dose change or interruption must 
be recorded in the dosage administrat ion record (CRF)  as appropriate.  
5.1.1  Administration  
Table   Treatment and  schedule 
Study treatments  Pharmaceutical form and route of 
administration  Dose  Frequency  and/or 
regimen  
LDE225  Capsule s (200 mg)  for oral use  800 mg Daily 
LDE225 will be administer ed orally, on a continuous once -daily schedule , at a dose of 800 
mg. Participating patient s will receive  flat doses on mg/day  basis  and not according to their 
body weight or body surface area. LDE225 is supplied as 200 -mg hard gelatin capsules in 
bottles  and m ust be stored at 2- 8°C/ 35.6- 46.3°F . Patients will receive 4 capsules of LDE225  
daily (= 800 mg/day) . 
5.1.2  Dosing and treatment schedule  
 
Patients will be dosed at  800 mg of LDE225 daily . Hard gelatin capsules at 200 mg are 
available (4 capsules will be taken all at one time) . Dose escalation wil l not be allowed . 
LDE225 should be taken as follows:  
• Men should be ins tructed to take their daily  dose at approximately the same time each day  
• On days where PK samples need to be collected prior to taking study drug, tha t day’s dose  
should be taken in  the clinic  (study site)  
• Each daily dose of LDE225 should be taken with a glass of water and consumed over as 
short a time as possible ( e.g. 1 capsule every 2 minutes)  
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 20 of 37 • Patients should be instructed to swallow capsules whole a nd to not chew or open capsules  
• Each daily dose of LDE225 (including days which involve PK blood sampling) should be 
taken 2 hours after  a light breakfast ( e.g., consisting of juice, toast and jam). Food intake 
should be avoided for at least 1 hour after s tudy drug administration  
• Patients must avoid grapefruit, pomegranate, star fruit and Seville (sour) oranges during 
the entire study. The juices and products containing these fruits may also be avoided.  
• If vomiting occurs during the course of the treatment, then no re -dosing of the patient is 
allowed before the next scheduled dose  the following day  
• If the  patient forgets to take his daily morning dose, then he  should take LDE225 within 6 
hours after the missed dose. If more than 6 hours have passed, then tha t day’s dose should 
be omitted and the patient should continue treatment with the next scheduled dose  
• Patients should inform the investigational site staff of any missed or delayed dose s 
5.1.3  Dose modification and dose delay  
 
Investigators should follow the gui delines described below  for the modification of  LDE225 
treatment .  Any plan to deviate from these guidelines in view of the patient  safety must be 
previously discussed with Novartis unless there is an urgent need for action.  
 
All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. If study treatment is  
being held due to toxicity, scheduled visits and all assessments should continue to occur  
except the dosing of the study drug.  Treatment related toxicities are adverse events that are 
possibl y, probably or definitely related to the study drug.  
 Any grade 3 or grade 4 toxicities will result in discontinuation of the study drug.  Men with prolonged grade 2 toxicity will receive a reduced dose of the study drug at 400mg.  If the grade 2 toxicitiy  continues on the reduced dose then the dose level will be reduced again to 
200mg.  A  maximum of two dose -reduction steps will be allowed  (see T able below ), after 
which the patient will be discontinued from study treatment.  
For patients who undergo dose i nterruptions (delays), i f the same toxicity returns after re -
initiation of treatment,  regardless of duration, the second re -initiation must resume at a lower 
dose. If the patient re quires a dose interruption of >7 days from the previous dose, then the 
patient must be discontinued from study treatment  although he may still undergo 
prostatectomy . Patients who discontinue the treatment due to an adverse event or an abnormal 
laboratory value must be followed until res olution or stabilizatio n of the event. 
 
All dose changes or interruptions  must be recorded in the dosage a dministration r ecord (CRF ) 
as appropriate .

All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity.   Treatment related toxicit ies are 
adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to the study drug.  
If the dose- limiting toxicity recurs in a patient following 2 dose reductions, then further therapy with 
LDE225 will not be continued.  
If a patient r equires a dose interruption of > 21 days from the intended day of the next scheduled dose 
because of an LDE225- related toxicity, then the patient must be discontinued from the study.  
*Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.0).  
** If the investigator deems that a recommended dose reduction or the recommendation to maintain the 
same dose level is not in the best interest of the patient, this decision may be discussed with Novartis 
on a case- by-case basis.  
5.1.4  Protocol Stopping Rules  
The study will be closed if >3 patients experience a delay in surgery by more than 2 weeks 
due to drug related toxicities.  In other words, if 4 or more patients in the experimental arm 
have their prostatectomy delayed by more than 2 weeks, we will close the s tudy.  In addition, 
the study will close if we observe >3 patients who experience a grade 3 or grade 4 adverse event that is possibly, probably or definitely related to the study drug.  In other words, if 4 or more patients in the experimental arm experien ce a grade 3 or grade 4 drug -related toxicity 
the study will be closed.  
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 24 of 37 5.1.5  Permitted concomitant therapy  
Medications required to treat adverse events  and manage cancer symptoms , concurrent stable 
disease ( e.g., controlled hypertension)  and s upportive care age nts such as erythropoietin, 
granulocyte growth factors, or blood transfusion, and pain medications  are allowed . The 
patient needs to notify the investigational site about any new medications he/she takes after 
the start of  the study medication . All medications (other than study drug) and significant non-
drug therapies (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) administered after the patient starts treatment with study drug must be listed on the CRF.  
5.1.6  Permitted concomitant therapy requiring caution a nd/or action  
LDE225 is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP ) in vitro . Therefore  
substrates, especially those with a narrow therapeutic range, should be used with caution. BCRP substrates include zidovudine, pantoprazole, cimetidine, sul fasalazine, nitrofuratoin, 
mitoxantrone, methotr exate, topotecan, imatinib, and irinotecan . However, the use of  statins is 
generally  prohibited during this study  (except for pravastatin) . 
In vitro  drug metabolism studies reveal that the metabolism of LDE225 is mediated by 
CYP3A4 and also a potent inhibitor of CY P2C9 and CYP2B6. C linical studies have not yet 
been performed to confirm the potential effect of LDE225 on substrates drugs metabolized by 
CYP2C9 in patients. Also, it is not known the potential effe ct of low and moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers on LDE225 clearance. Therefore, investigators, at their discretion, may administer concomitant medications known to be metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2B6, except drugs which have narrow therapeutic index/sensitive substrates for these two  isoforms 
and statins . Caution is advised when LDE225 is co- administered with drugs that are moderate 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. Patients receiving such medications must be monitored 
closely for any potentiation of toxicity or decrease of clinical benefit due to any individual 
concomitant medications, and may require dose titration or  adjustment . 
5.1.7  Prohibited concomitant therapy  
5.1.7.1  Other investi gational therapies  
Other  investigational therapies must not be used while the patient is on the study.  Anticancer 
therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or radiation therapy, and surgery) other than 
the study treatments must not be given to patients while the patient is on the study medication. If such agents are required fo r a patient then the patient must be discontinued from the 
treatment portion of the study . 
5.1.7.2  Strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers  
No clinical studies have been performed to confirm if LDE225 is a sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate, hence concomitant use of strong CY P3A4 inhibitors  and inducers  is not permitted .  
Patients receiving concomitant medications known to strongly inhibit and/or induce 
CYP3A4/5 that are deemed medically necessary should be excluded from the study. A partial list of drugs that are inducers, and inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 is included in the Table below . 
This list  of medications has been generated by Novartis Oncology Clinical Pharmacology 
(OncCP ) (DDI database document: last update August 2010) that is compiled by using 
information listed under “dr aft guidance for industry, drug interaction studies, CDER 2006”, 
Indiana University School of Medicine drug interaction tables at 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 25 of 37 http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/DDIs/ClinicalTable , and “drug interaction  from 
University of Washington. Patients should be instructed not to take grapefruit, St John Wort 
or Seville (sour) orange juice while receiving LDE225 treatment throughout the study due to potential CYP3A4/5 inhibition. The other dr ugs without an asterisk should be carefully used 
as concomitant therapy .

5.1.7.3  CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 substrates (narrow therapeutic index)  
LDE225 is a potent inhibitor of drugs metabolized by the cytochromes CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 in vitro . Becau se of the potential risk for drug- drug interactions, using concomitant 
medications known to be metabolized by these enzymes  that have low therapeutic index  (see 
Table below ) is not permitted in the study . The other drugs without an  asterisk should be 
caref ully used as concomitant therapy .

phenytoin, rosiglitazone, tamoxifen, torsemide, warfarin*, quinidine*  
* - narrow therapeutic index: drugs whose exposure- response indicates that increases in their 
exposure levels by the concomitant use of potent inhibi tors may lead to serious safety concerns (e.g. 
Torsade de Pointes) are not allowed  
 
& - statins  – If it is essential that the patient takes a statin to control hyperlididemia [see Section 
5.1.7.5 ], then only pravastatin  may be used with extra caution. Prav astatin has the lowest potential of 
cause rhabdomyolysis compared with other statins (3 cases/ 6 millions of prescription from 1994 to 
2002) ( Evans et al. 2002) and the lowest risk for drug- drug interactions with LDE225, as it is primarily 
transformed in t he liver cytosol by sulfonation, not by CYP2C9 or CYP3A4. ( Evans et al. 2002)  
5.1.7.4  Warfarin and coumadin derivatives 
Therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium  (Coumadin®) or any other coumadin -derivative  
anticoagulants are not permitted  since LDE225 is a competitiv e inhibitor of CYP2C9 based 
on the in vitro  data. An alternative, therapeutic anticoagulation may be accomplished using 
low-molecular weight heparin . 
5.1.7.5   Drugs that may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis   
Selected drugs that may increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used 
concomitantly with LDE225 should be avoided. Such drugs should be discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of LDE225 and it must be ensured the plasma CK is within the normal range at baseline. The list compiled below is based on reported association of the individual drugs with muscle toxicity and in addition to the potential risk of clinically relevant PK drug -drug interaction with LDE225 through inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 (enzyme 
metabolized  LDE225) or the inhibitory  effect on CYP2C9 by LDE225 of drugs that may 
induced rhabdomyolysis. 
 
• Azoles :   Itraconazole, ketoconazole,  fluconazole,  voriconazole  
• Macrolides:   A zithromycin,  clarithromycin,  erythromycin,  telitromycin  
• Fibrates: G emfibrozil, fenofibrate  
• HMG CoA re ductase inhibitors* (“statins ”): Atovasta tin, Fluvastatin, Fluvastatin, 
Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin and Simvastatin  
• Antiretrovirals: Indonavir and ritonavir  
• Others: phenobarbital, barbiturates,  phenytoin and isoniazid  
 
* If it is essential that the patient s tays on a statin to control hyperlididemia [see 
Section 5.1.7.5 ], only pravastatin may be used with extra caution;  CK should be 
monitored w eekly during treatment with LDE225.  
5.2 Study drug (LDE225) 
5.2.1  Packaging and labeling 
LDE 225 capsules  will be supplied by No vartis as 200-mg hard gelatin capsules  for oral use , 
package d in bottles, and will be administered on a flat scale of 800 mg/day  for all patients .  
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015

5.2.2  Supply, receipt and storage  
Study drug must be received  by a designated person at the study site (usually the site 
pharmacist) , handled and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which 
only the investigator and designated assistants have access. Upon receipt, LDE225 should be 
stored acco rding to the instructions specified on the drug labels.  Study  medication will be 
dispensed by an authorized person at the investigator’s site  (usually the pharmacist) .  
Patients will be provided with adequate supply of LDE225 for self -administration at home 
until at least their next scheduled study visit (i.e. at least a 4 -week period) .  Patients should be 
instructed to store LDE225 capsules in the refrigerator.  
5.2.3  Drug compliance and accountability  
5.2.3.1  Drug accountability  
Clinical drug supply must be accounted for and patients will be asked to return all unused 
study drug and packaging on a regular basis, at the end of the study or at the time of study drug discontinuation.  
At the conclusion of the study, and, as appropriate during the course of the study, the Investigator will return all used and unused study drug, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of 
the completed drug accountability ledger  to Novartis .  
5.2.4  Disposal and destruction  
The drug supply will be destroyed at a  Novartis facility, Drug Supply group or thir d party, as 
appropriate . Study drug destruction at the Investigational S ite will only be permitted if 
authorized by Novartis in a prior agreement and if permitted by local regulations.

Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 29 of 37  
6.1.1  Screening E valuation 
The screening examination must start with the Informed C onsent procedure. The investigator 
is obliged to give the patient thorough information about the study and the study related 
assessments, and the patient should be given ample time to consider his or h er participation. 
The investigator must not start any study related procedure before ICF is signed and dated by both patient  (and  impartial witness, if applicable) and investigator.  
6.2 Assessment s 
6.2.1  Efficacy  assessments 
The primary measures of efficacy in this  trial are pharmacodynamic measured by the change 
in Gli1 expression by qRT -PCR.  In addition, efficacy will also be evaluated in secondary 
endpoints which will compare tumor stage, grade, surgical margin rates and tumor proliferation / apoptosis between t reatment and observation arms.  The proportion of patients 
with undetectable PSAs at three mont hs will also be assessed in  the two groups. 
6.2.2  Safety assessments  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events  (AEs) , 
including se rious adverse events, the monitoring of hematology , blood chemistry, ECG and 
the regular monitoring of vital signs, and physical condition as shown in corresponding tables .  
All patients will receive CK level monitoring at baseline, day 14 and day 28 with additional levels drawn in patients report symptoms of rhabdomyolysis during the study.  For details on AE collection and reporting, refer to the Safety section in the protocol .   
In addition, we will pay particular attention to peri- operative adverse even ts (intraoperative 
bleeding, increased operative time, increased hospital length of stay, increased postoperative infections, wound breakdowns, etc.).  These will be monitored by review of in hospital records and post -operative clinic notes.  
6.2.3  Pharmacokineti cs 
Plasma LDE225 trough levels ( PK) will be measured at baseline and on the day of 
prostatectomy using LC -MS/MS . 
6.2.4  Biomarkers  
For analysis of Gli1  expression, RNA will be purified using the RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) and 
then cDNA will be synthesized  according to standard procedures.  Quantitative  PCR will then 
be performed using the Taqman system with primers for Gli1 and the reference gene HPRT1 .  
Applied Biosystems software will be used to calculate threshold cycle values (and thus relative expression levels) . Normalized changes in Gli1  expression between  each patient pre - 
and post -operatively and between each group (observation versus treat ment arm) will be made 
with 2 -sided pairwise comparison s considering P <  0.05 to be statistically significant.      
Genome -wide mRNA expression data will also be collected with comparisons made both 
within and between treatment groups.  This analysis will look for expression based indications of molecular pathway alterations upon exposure to LDE225 and will do so in an unbias ed 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 30 of 37 way.  For each array, data will be processed for statistical analysis using packages f rom 
R/Bioconductor with a mixed- effects model used to fit for each gene and to estimate 
expression differences between groups and an empirical Bayesian approach used to moderate 
log2 fold change standard errors. Functional themes will be obtained from Gene Ontology, 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, the Humna Protein Reference Databases and 
Molecular Signature Databases and used to perform enrichment analysis usin g Wilcoxon 
tests.  Multiple testing corrections will be performed using the Benjamini- Hochberg method.   
7 Safety M onitoring and Reporting 
7.1 Adverse Events 
7.1.1  Definitions and reporting 
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by the subject, disc overed by 
investigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate. An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after  starting study drug (or 
therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug (or therapy). Study drug (or therapy) includes the drug (or therapy) under evaluation, and any reference or placebo drug (or therapy) given during any phase of the trial.  
• if it is unclear what study treatment includes, list all drug(s), other therapies, changes to 
existing therapy, diagnostic procedure, etc. that are specified by the protocol  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment a re only considered 
adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the 
protocol). Adverse events occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the informed consent form are recorded. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AE s 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy, and are recorded.  
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded on the FDA MedWatch 3500a F orm. To ensure patient saf ety each serious adverse event must also be 
reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
1. is fatal or life -threatening  
2. required or prolonged hospitali zation  
3. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
4. constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect  
5. is medically significant, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes liste d above.  
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for the:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
• treatment, which was elective or pre- planned, for a pr e-existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hospital admission.  
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 31 of 37 Pregnancy, although not itself an SAE , should also be r eported on an SAE  form or pregnancy 
form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous/ voluntary termination, 
details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities. 
Any SAE  occurring after the patie nt has provided informed consent, has started taking the 
study medication, and until 4 weeks after the patient has stopped study participation must be 
reported. This includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard medical treat ment given to a patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, change 
in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication). The period after discontinuing study drug may be extended if there is a strong suspicion that the drug has not yet bee n eliminated.  
This is a DSMP Level II study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan (12/6/2012). Data Monitoring of this protocol will occur on a regular basis with the frequency dependent on the rate of subject accrual and the progress of the study. T he protocol will be monitored 
internally at SKCCC by the Principal Investigator and externally by the SKCCC CRO in accordance with SKCCC guidelines. Trial monitoring and reporting will be done through the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) at SKCCC.  
7.2 Instruc tions for rapid notification of serious adverse events  
7.2.1  Reporting responsibility  
The principal investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse  events to the FDA, 
IRB, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals  Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department ( DS&E)  
7.2.2  Reporting procedures  
All SAEs are reported to the FDA by the trial’s IND Sponsor -Investigator (Dr. Antonarakis) 
via the IND annual report per 21 CFR 312.33. All SAEs deemed unexpected and related to the investigational product qualify for expedited reporti ng and must be submitted to the FDA by 
the IND Sponsor -Investigator per 21 CFR 312.32 as shown immediately below. The IND 
Sponsor -Investigator is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or life -threatening adverse 
event that is unexpected and assessed by t he Sponsor -Investigator to be possibly related to the 
use of LDE225 within 7 calendar -days of first learning of the event. An unexpected adverse 
event deemed possibly related to the use of an investigational study drug is defined as any adverse drug experi ence of which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the current 
investigator brochure, the general investigational plan, or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. Such reports are to be telephoned or faxed to the FDA within 7 calendar -days of 
first learning of the event. The IND Sponsor -Investigator is required to notify the FDA in a 
written IND Safety Report, of any serious, unexpected adverse event considered by the Sponsor -Investigator to be possibly related to the use of LDE225 w ithin 15 calendar -days of 
first learning of the event.  
In addition to the above, t he investigator must complete the FDA MedWatch 3500a form and 
Novartis SAE coversheet in English, assess the relationship to study treatment and send the initial completed Me dWatch form and Novartis SAE coversheet by fax 1.888.299.4565 within 
24 hours to the local Novartis Drug  Safety & Epidemiology ( DS&E) Department.  The 
investigator must then ensure that the form and coversheet are accurately and fully  completed 
with follow -up information and fax those to Novartis D S&E Department within 2 to 3 
calendar days for deaths or life- threatening events and 5 calendar days for other serious 
adverse events. The original and the duplicate copies of the FDA MedWatch form, Novartis 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 32 of 37 SAE c oversheet, and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the case report forms at the 
study site.  
Follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whe ther the patient continued or 
discontinued study participation. The MedWatch form, Novartis SAE coversheet, and fax 
confirmation sheet must be retained. Pregnancy follow -up should describe the outcome of the 
pregnancy, including any voluntary or spontaneous termination, details of the birth, and the 
presence or absence of any congenital abnormalities or birth defects. 
7.3 Pregnancies  
Each pregnancy occurring for a female partner of a male study participant must be reported 
while the patient is on study treatmen t and for up to 6 months after the patient’s last dose.  
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study treatment in this study . 
8 Statistical Methods and Data A nalysis  
In general  terms, we wish to determine if there  is a statistically significant reduction in Gli1  
expression in prostate  tissue  after a 4-week exposure to LDE225. We expect  to see significant 
down- regulation of Gli1 in the t reatment arm compared to  the observational arm.   
8.1 Sample size considerations , and analysis of the primary endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is a ≥50% reduction in Gli1 mRNA (or protein) expression following treatment with LDE225. This study will compare prostatectomy Gli1 expression levels to presurgical biopsy Gli1  expression levels in the same patients ( i.e. intra -patient changes) . In 
the control group ( observation), we expect <10% of patients to show a ≥50% Gli1  
downregulation (null hypothesis), while in the LDE225 group we would hypothesize that >50% of patients would demonstrate a ≥ 70% Gli1 downregulation (alternative hypothesis). 
Using a 2 -sided alpha ( α) of 0.10 and a beta ( β) of 0.20 (power = 80%), a sample size of 11 
men/arm  (total = 22 men) would be required to observe a difference in the primary endpoint 
from <10% (in the control  arm) to ≥ 70% (in the LDE225 arm).  
8.2 Analysis  of the secondary endpoints  
 
• Apoptotic markers.  Caspase 3 staining (and/or TUNEL assay results) will be expressed 
as the mean staining percentage in tumor samples, and reported separately for each treatment group. Standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals, and ranges will also be reported where appropriate. Means will be compared across treatment arms using two -way ANOVA.  
 
• Proliferation markers.  Ki-67 staining will be expressed as the mean staining percentage 
in tumor samples, reported separately for each treatment arm. Standard deviations, 95% 
confidence intervals, and ranges will also be reported where appropriate. Means will be compared across treatment arms using two -way ANOVA.  
 
• Pathological complete respons es (pCR).  This will be defined as an absence of tumor 
identification on standard histological analysis of the resected prostate specimens. The proportion of patients achieving a pCR will be compared between treatment arms using the Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 33 of 37  
• PSA response rates.  This will be defined as an undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/mL) at 3 
months after prostatectomy. The proportion of patients achieving a PSA response will be 
compared between treatment arms using the Mantel -Haenszel test.  
8.3 Analysis of the exploratory endpoints  
 
Genome -wide mRNA expression data  will also be collected with comparisons made both 
within and between treatment groups.  This analysis will look for expression based indications of molecular pathway alterations upon exposure to LDE225 and w ill do so in an unbiased 
way. For each array, data will be processed for statistical analysis using packages from 
R/Bioconductor with a mixed- effects model used to fit for each gene and to estimate 
expression differences between groups and an empirical Bay esian approach used to moderate 
log2 fold change standard errors. Functional themes will be obtained from Gene Ontology, 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, the Humna Protein Reference Databases and Molecular Signature Databases and used to perform en richment analysis using Wilcoxon 
tests.  Multiple testing corrections will be performed using the Benjamini- Hochberg method.  
9 Ethical Considerations  
9.1 Ethics and good clinical practice  
This study must be carried out in compliance with the protocol and GCP , as described in:  
1. ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 1996.  
2. US 21 Code of Federal Regulations dealing with clinical studies (including parts 50 and 56 concerning informed consent and IRB regulations). 
3. Declaration of Helsi nki, concerning medical research in humans (Recommendations 
Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Helsinki 1964, amended Tokyo 1975, Venice 1983, Hong Kong 1989, Somerset West 1996). 
The investigator agr ees to adhere to the instructions and procedures described in it and 
thereby to adhere to the principles of Good Clinical Practice that it conforms to. 
9.2 Institutional review board / Independent ethics c ommittee  
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed c onsent form and other 
information to subjects, must be reviewed by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC/REB). A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by the I RB/IEC/REB must be given to 
Novartis before study initiation. The name and occupation of the chairman and the members of the IRB/IEC/REB must be supplied to Novartis. Any amendments to the protocol, other than administrative ones, must be approved by this committee.  
9.3 Informed consent  
The investigator must explain to each subject (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomf ort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that 
participation in the study is voluntary and that he may withdraw from the study at any time 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 34 of 37 and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his subsequent medical treatment or relationship 
with the treating physician. 
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in 
non-technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing 
and dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the subject cannot read or sign the documents, oral presentation may be made or signature given by the subject’s legally appointed representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the patient could not read or si gn the documents. No patient can enter the study before his 
informed consent has been obtained. The informed consent form is considered to be part of 
the protocol, and must be submitted by the investigator with it for IRB/IEC/REB approval.  
Fertile men sho uld be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks 
to a conceived fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to 
participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the durati on of 
the study. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they should not be entered in the study.  
9.4 Discontinuation of the study  
Novartis reserves the right to discontinue support for any study under the conditions specified 
in the clinical trial agreement.  
9.5 Amendments to the protocol  
Any change or addition to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis and the investigator before implementation. Amendments significantly affecting the safety  of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the 
study, require additional approval by the IRB/IEC/REB. A copy of the written approval of the IRB/IEC/REB, must be sent to Novartis. 
Amendments affecting only administrative aspec ts of the study do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB/IEC/REB approval but the IRB/IEC/REB of each center must be kept 
informed of such administrative changes.  
9.5.1  Publication of results  
Any formal presentation or publication of data from this tria l may be published after review and comment by 
Novartis and prior to any outside submission.  Novartis must receive copies of any intended communication in 
advance of publication (at least twenty -one working days for presentational materials and abstracts and thirty 
working days for manuscripts).   These requirements acknowledge Novartis’ responsibility to provide peer input regarding the scientific content and conclusions of such publications or presentations.  Principal 
Investigat or/Institution shall have  the final authority to determine the scope and content of its publications, 
provided such authority shall be exercised with reasonable regard for the interests of Novartis and, in accord with 
the tr ial contract and shall not permit disclosure of Novartis confidential or proprietary information.  
9.5.2  Disclosure and confidentiality  
The investigator agrees to keep all information provided by Novartis in strict confidence and to request similar 
confidentialit y from his/her staff and the IRB/IEC/REB. Study documents provided by Novartis (investigators' 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 35 of 37 brochures and other material) will be stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality. The information 
provided by Novartis to the investigator may not be disclosed to others without direct written authorization from 
Novartis, except to the extent necessary to obtain informed consent from patients who wish to participate in the 
trial. 
9.5.3  Declaration of Helsinki  
The investigator must conduct the trial in accordan ce with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Copies 
of the Declaration of Helsinki and amendments will be provided upon request or can be accessed via the website

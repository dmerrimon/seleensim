FAME 103B ve rsion 1.0 10  07Apr2020 2 Introduction 
 
2.1 Vaginal films for HI V prevention  
 
Sexual transmission accounts for the majority of new  HIV inf ections worldwide. While most 
cases of sexual transmission involve both a male part ner and a female partner, women are 
disproportionately impacted by  the sexual transmission of HIV1. This disproportionate impact 
arises from a combination of biologi c, socia l, and economic factors. Women at risk face 
formidable challenges in protecting the mselves from HIV infection, including power diff erentials, 
gender norms, and economic dependence.  
  
Topical microbicides are agents designed to prevent or substanti ally red uce the acquisition and 
transmission of HIV when applied to the genital or gastroin testinal mucosa. In addition to 
preventing HIV i nfection, topical microbicides may satisfy two critical needs: affordability and 
female control. Topical microbicides  also ha ve the potential for high acceptability for both male 
and female partners. Acceptability and utility of topical microbicides can be maximized by the 
development of an array of dosing formulations.   
 
Vaginal films are an attractive dosing option for severa l reasons. In terms of manufacturing, 
films are inexpensive, scalable, physically and chemically stable, uniform with regards to 
product content, and amenable to combinations of active ingredients. In terms of use, films are 
discreet, portable, and easy to  store. Vaginal films can deliver fixed doses of microbicidal agents 
with minimal m ess and without an applicator. The small volume of vaginal films m ay also result 
in less dilution of endogenous antiviral or antibacterial properties of vaginal flui ds compa red to 
vaginal gels. In studies of spermicidal film, women have found vaginal films  to be 
acceptable2,3,4. When Vaginal Contracepti ve Film (VCF) was compared to foaming tablets 
containing nonoxynol -9 (N -9), contraceptive film was preferred in three  differe nt countries2. 
Ninety -seven percent of 59 Mexican women, 60 percent of 52 Dominican women, and 86 
percent of 51 Kenyan women report ed liking contracep tive film.  In particular, they cited the 
following favorable characteristics: ease of use, general feel o r comfort, additional lubrication, 
and lack of side effects . Over eighty percent of  Cameroonian sex workers, who participated in a 
large randomized pl acebo -controlled trial of N -9 film, reported that they would use the film were 
it found to be effective ag ainst HIV3. In Zambian focus groups, placebo vaginal film was 
preferred over placebo vaginal tablets and soft -gel capsules after each product was used  once 
daily for one week 4.  In a study evaluating the acceptability of placebo microbicidal film,  soft gel 
capsule and tablet, African women were instructed to use each of the three produc ts once daily 
for 7 consecutive days. The film and soft -gel capsul e were chosen significantly more often than 
the tablet as the preferred dosage form (39%, 37% and 25%, resp ectively). In this particular 
study, film and soft gel were preferred because of faster dissolving time and easier insertion4.  In 
other studies, par ticipants found vaginal films to be less messy than foaming tablets or gel2,5.  
 
2.2 Integrated Preclinical /Clinical Program  
 
The Film Antiretroviral Microbicide Evaluation (FAME) program brings  together an inter -
disciplinary group of researc h scientists from f our academic institutions: University of Pittsburgh, 
University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon Uni versity,  and the University of Colorado. The long-
term goal of the program is to develop and evaluate an extended delivery vaginal film containing 
an integrase  inhibitor which could provide protection from HIV for one week or more following a 
single applic ation. The first iteration of the FAME IPCP established proof of concept that vaginal 
films containing the antiretrovirals (ARVs) dapivirine and tenofovir cou ld deliver drug to target 
FAME 103B ve rsion 1.0 11  07Apr2020 tissues as effectively as gel formulations of those same ARVs. The second iterat ion strives to 
develop an extended release formulation of an integr ase inhibitor MK -2048 which will provide 
coverage for 7 days aft er each use.  FAME- 103 is the backbone of this effort.  
 
2.3 FAME -103 
 
FAME- 103 is  clinical study of a vaginal film containing the integrase inhibitor MK -2048 in a 
formulation containing either high or low concentr ations of the extended release polymer 
Eudragit® .  MK-2048 is a pot ent 2nd generation integrase inhibitor ; the extended platform film to 
be used in FAME -103 is inten ded to provide 7 days of protection.  The primary objective of 
FAME- 103 is  to evaluate the safety of the two formulations of MK -2048 vaginal film . A key 
seco ndary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the two film formulations.    
 
Because safety  and pharmacokinetics  are key study outcomes,  the active vaginal film will be 
inserted by a  clinician .  Product misplacement was noted in t he last four clini cal trials of vaginal 
film previously conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. While most partici pants could 
successfully insert the vaginal films, incorrect film placement was noted for s ome. In some 
instances, the vaginal film stuck t o the finger after  attempted insertion and in other instances the 
film was visualized on the external genitalia.    
 
2.4 FAME -103B Rationale  
 The objective of the FAME -103B study is to evaluate whether study part icipants can self -insert   
the high and low Eudr agit® content plac ebo films. In previous vaginal film trials conducted at the 
University of Pittsburgh, participants have had variable success with self -insertion. As the 
Eudragit® film formulation as an extended platform moves forward with other active 
pharmaceutical ingred ients in clinical trials, understanding whether the level of Eudragit® in the 
film impacts ease of  inserti on is vitally important.  
 
In order to evaluate whether Eudragit® content impacts ease of self -insertion, participants will 
be asked to self -insert ea ch placebo film  and complete a survey reporting their perceptions and 
experience.  Within 10 minutes of the  insertion, clinical staff will perform a speculum exam to 
assess the location of t he film and remove the residual film. This study  poses minimal ris ks to 
participants as the safety of the high Eudragit® placebo fil m has already been evaluated in 
FAME- 101 and found to be safe. The risk to study participants will also be minimized because 
the film will be removed immediately after insertion thereby limi ting exposure to under 10  
minutes for each film. The feasibility o f easy film removal after self -insertion has been 
established by the clinical staff at the Reproductive Infectious Disease U nit at Magee -Womens 
Hospital who have removed fi lm within 15 minut es of insertion in at least 40 prior participants . 
Thus, no techni cal or safety issues with film re moval  are anticipated.  
 
 
2.5 Safety Data: Eudragit® platform  
 The Eudragit® film has a proven s afety record.  
 
Pre-Clinical Safety Data  
Safety evaluation of the extended release placebo film was performed in a nonhuman primate 
model.  Six pigtailed macaques wer e exposed to two films per week for two weeks, which is 
double the proposed human dosing (i ntended dosing is one film per week). In total, four films 
were delivered to each macaque over fourteen days. The vaginal microbiota, vaginal pH, and 
FAME 103B ve rsion 1.0 12  07Apr2020 number of PMNs on gram stained vaginal smears were assessed before the first film placement 
and after the fourth film placement.  The integrity of the cer vicovaginal tissues was assessed by 
colposcopy at each film placement. Of note, ther e was visible film in the vagina with eac h film 
placement. No adverse events were noted by colposcopy; microbiota remained s table with no 
effect noted on the beneficial H 202 producing microorganisms; vaginal pH remained within 
normal range; and PMN counts remained within the normal range even aft er more frequent 
administration than intended for use (Patton, personal communicati on). The entire study report 
is presented in Appendix IV.  
 
Clinica l Safety Data  
FAME- 101 was a safety and acceptability st udy of the higher Eudragit® level . Sixty -four HIV 
uninfected, healthy women were enrolled. At enrollment the participants were randomi zed to 
timing of the follow -up visit. They then attempted self -insertion of the film. Immediately after this 
attempt, a clinician perf ormed a visual inspection. If m ost of t he film was visualized outside of 
the introitus, the film was removed by the clinic ian and a second film placed by the clinician 
during a speculum ex amination. Participants returned either 3,7,10 or 14 days after fi lm 
placement depending on their r andomization and then all participants returned for a final safety 
assessment three weeks after enrollment. Safety assessments, acceptabili ty parameters, and  
changes to the vaginal microenvironment were assessed at each vis it. The persistence of the 
film was noted . 
 
 
Eighty -four participants were screened and 64 enrolled. The median age was 26.5  years; 56% 
were white and 27% non- Hispanic blac k. The primary endpoint was Grade 2 or higher AEs. 
There were 6 Grade 2 events; thes e included bacterial vaginosis, v aginal i tching, pelvic 
cramping (2), friable cervix and adnexal pain. Of these, only bacter ial vaginosis and vaginal 
itching were attributed to study product  use.  Forty -seven AEs were reported amongst 64 
participants. Thir ty-one participants (48.5%) repor ted at l east one AE; 22 reported at least one 
urogenital event. For the women randomized to  the 3 and 7 day follow up visit approximately 
50% of the participants had visible film on speculum exam (44% and 56%). In summary, the 
high Eudragit® film was very well tolerated with no concerning safety signals.

4 Study Population  
 
4.1 Selection of the Study Po pulation  
 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria in this section will be utilized to ensure the appropriate 
selection of study partic ipants .  
 
4.2 Recruitm ent 
 
For this study, 30  pre-menopausal women , 18 –  45 years of age , will be enrolled over 
approxima tely a 3-month period.   Participants may be recruited from medical  clinics,  local 
colleges,  a list of previous study participants and the c ommunity  by member s of the 
Reproductive Infectious Disease Research staff .  This rec ruitment strategy is likely to capture a 
diverse population as this community is comprised of approximately 48% White, 48% A frican -
American and 4% other ethnicities includi ng Hispanic, Asian, Indian and Native American.  An 
IRB approved screening script may  be used to provide study information and assess minimum 
eligibility during the recruitment process.  After the study has been presented  and questions 
have been answered, p articipants will b e scheduled for an enrollment visit at UPMC Magee -
Womens Hospital.    
 
4.3 Study Design Summary 
 
After p roviding  written informed consent, the participant will  provide answer s to a brief 
questionnaire, have urine collected for pregnancy testing, and have saliva collected for rapid 
HIV testing  (unless a result from previous 6 months is available) .  Once deemed eligib le, vaginal 
swabs will be collected (without a speculum) for sexu ally transmitted i nfection testing  
(gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomonas ).    
 
The participant will then be randomized to insertion order for the tw o formulations of a placebo 
vaginal  film [high and low ammonio- methacrylate copolymer type B (Eudragit®) ].  Once a 
participant  is randomized to the film, she is considered en rolled.  
 
Clinic s taff will obtain the films from the pharmacy and will  provide instruction to the participant 
on the  proper technique of self -insertion. The clinician and the participant will be in the same 
room during self -insertion of the films but will be separated by a privacy curtain.  The clinician 
will be available to answer questions  and document concerns/comm ents.  The  participant will 
attempt self -insertion of the first film   and immediat ely afterwa rd (within 10 minutes)  the clinic 
staff will perform a speculum exam to determine the location of the f ilm. The clinical staff will 
remove all visible film  and ask the p articipant to complete a brief questionnaire regarding her 
experience with that specifi c film.   The participant will then be asked  to self -insert the second 
film. After the second film insertion , the clinical staff will perform a nother  speculum ex am to 
determine the film’s location and remove any visible film .  The participant will then answer 
another  brief questionnaire regarding he r experience with the second film as well as additional 
questions regarding her preference of film and questions surr ounding challenges with self -
insertion.  It is anticipated that gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomonas testing will be resulted 
within the week. Participants will be notified of any positive ST I test reported by telephone, and 
necessary treatment and referrals will be provided.  It should be noted that STI  testing is 
provided in this study as a courtes y to the participants  and not for eligibilit y purposes.

3. Agrees to abstain from inserting anythi ng into the vagina for 24 hours prior to the 
study visit  
 4.5 Exclusion Criteria  
 
Women who meet any of the following criteri a by parti cipant report will be excluded from the 
study. Of note, the study is limited to premenopausal women with an intact ut erus bec ause the 
mucosal environment differs substantially between pre - and post - menopausal wo men. 
Therefore, inclusion of post -menopausal women would introduce heterogeneity into the 
population.

7. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the placebo film  
 
8. Any condition that, in the  opinion of the Investigator, would preclude provision of  
consent, make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpr etation of study 
outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.   
5 Study Procedures  
 
This section describes  visit-specific study procedures.  
    
5.1 Pre-screening  
 
As part of participant outreach and recruitment strategies, study st aff may pre- screen potential 
study participants (e.g. via telephone). During these interactions,  study staff may use an IR B 
approved telephone script to explain the study to participants an d ascertain elements of 
presumptive eligibility, to be conf irmed at  the time of enrollment. If the participant is eligible 
based on a screening script her name and  appointment time will be placed on the script.  If she 
FAME 103B ve rsion 1.0 15  07Apr2020 signs consent, the telephone script w ill then become part of her research record. If she does not 
sign c onsent, the form will be de- identified.  
 
 
5.2 Study visit  
 
The participant will present to the study  clinic. Written informed  consent w ill be obtained. A brief 
medical history will be taken to  ensure eligibility. Height and weight will be obtained and 
particip ants will be asked a brief baseline questionnaire, which will include questions related to 
previ ous film use.  Saliva  for HIV antib ody testing (unless a negative result is available from t he 
past 6 months) , urine for pregnancy testing and vaginal s wabs for  Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 
Chlamydia trachomatis , and Trichomonas vaginalis  nucleic acid amplificat ion testing will be 
collec ted. The urine pregnancy test result will be available before the p articipant is randomized . 
Counsel ing and referral will take place as necessary.   HIV test results will be available before 
the end of the visit and will be provided to the participant.  Giv en the ve ry low risk of the women 
being enrolled in this study, HI V test result will not be needed prior to randomizing.  In the very 
unlikely event of a positive rapid HIV test, a blood sample will be drawn to send to the main 
UPMC laboratory for confirma tory test ing.  The vaginal STI testing results will not be availabl e in 
real time and will not impact eligibility.   
 
Clinic s taff will obtain study product from the pharmacy and will instruct ion the participant on the 
proper technique of self -insertion. The partic ipant will attempt self -insertion of the first film and 
immediately afterward the clinic staff will perform a speculum exam t o determine the location of 
the film. The clinical staff will remove all visible film .after the clinician verifies placement.   The 
clinician will use an instrument as needed (e.g. forceps) to grab and remove the film.   This 
method was successful  in remo ving the  entire piece of film from previous studies.  The study 
staff will then ask the participant to complete  a brief questionnaire regarding her experience with 
that specific  film.  The participant will then be asked to self -insert the second film. A fter the 
second film insertion, the clinical staff will perform another  speculum exam to determine the 
film’s loca tion and remove any visible film .  The participant will then answer  another brief 
questionnaire regarding her experience with the second film as well as additional questions 
regarding her preference of film and questions surrounding challenges w ith self -insertion.   
 
It is anticipated that gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichom onas  testing results will be reported within 
the week. Participants  will be  notified of any positive STI test result  by telephone, and necessary 
treatment and referrals will be provided.  It should be noted that STI testing is provided in this 
study as a co urtesy to the participants and not for eligibility purposes

5.3 Telephone foll ow-up 
 
Clinic staff will call participant s with the results of the Neisseria  gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia 
trachomatis , and Trichomonas vaginalis  nucleic acid amplification testing when available if 
resulted positi ve. This is consistent with standard clinical car e.  Treatment will be provided per 
CDC recommended guidelines,  as necessary.  
6 Study Product  
 
6.1 Regimen  
 Each participant will receive one vaginal film containing high level  Eudragit®  and one vaginal 
film containing low level  Eudragit®.  
 
6.2 Administration  
 
FAME 103B ve rsion 1.0 17  07Apr2020 After  eligibility is confirmed, site staff will randomize the participant  to sequ ence of film insertion. 
The site staff will retrieve  two films from the pharmacy. The site staff will p rovide insertion 
instructions to the participant and the participant will sel f-insert the vaginal films in the order 
assigned by randomization.    Neithe r the participant nor the study staff will know which film is 
the higher  level or low er level film.  Th e order of use will be docum ented in the participant’s 
record .   
 
6.3 Study Produc t Formulation   
 
Participants will receive two placebo films that differ in  the content of Eudragit.  The films are 2” 
x 2.”  
 6.4 Study Product Supply and Accountability  
 
Study product was manufactured and pac kage by Benefit Coatings, Stratford, CT, in compl iance  
with cGMP.  The packaged study product will be provided to the UPMC Magee- Womens 
Hospital Pharmacy  and will be labeled to maintain the blind of the films (e.g. film A and fil m B) .  
All study product wil l be available to the study staff through the Mage e Investigational Drug 
Service  Pharmacy.  
 
The Magee research pharmacist will maintain complete accountability records of all study 
products received for this protocol and dispens ed to parti cipants.       
 
The film is packaged into a foil -lined pouch and st ored at room temperature.  
 
In the event that a participant is unable to inse rt the film  (e.g. sticks to her finger) , insertion will 
be deemed unsuccessful and the participant will  not be dis pensed another replacement film.   
 
However, i f a film is dropped or damaged, the film will be discarded and accounted for by the 
clinical sta ff in the participant record and a new replacement film will be obtained from the 
pharmacy.   
 
6.5 Study Pr oduct Dispensing  
 
Study products will be dispensed only to enrolled participa nts upon receipt of a written study 
product order form  signed by an  authori zed prescriber.

7.2 Specimen Collection and P rocessing  
 
The site will adhere to the standards of good clinical l aborator y practice and site standard 
operating procedures for proper collection, processing, labeling, handling, and trans port of 
specimens . In cases where laboratory results are not avail able due to administrative or 
laboratory error, sites are permitted to  recol lect specimens.  
 7.3 Biohazard Containment  
 
As the transmission of HIV and other blood- borne pathogens can occur throu gh contact with 
contaminated fluid, appropriat e secretion precauti ons w ill be employed by all personnel in the 
handling of all specimens for t his study as recommended by the CDC and NIH . 
8 Assessment of Safety and Clinical Management  
 
8.1 Safety Monit oring  
 
The study site invest igators are responsible for continuous close safe ty mo nitoring of all study 
participants  and for alerting the Protocol Chairs  if unexpected concerns arise.   Appropriate 
safety monitoring will be contingent upon excellent communi cation betw een study partici pants 
and study staff, and upon cooperation among study staff, and the physician investigator.  
 Given this study involves a s ingle study visit, use of placebo films which are immediately 
removed after insertion, and poses minimal risk to t he participant, adverse events are not 
expected.  In the very unli kely event that an unanticipated event occurs, the protocol chair  and 
the DA IDS medical officers  will be made aware of the event,  and the event will be reported as 
applicable to the policies outlined on the IRB website:  www.irb.pitt.edu.  
 
8.2 Adverse Events Definitions   
 
An AE is defined  as any untoward medical occurrence in a cli nical research participant 
administered an investigational product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with t he investigational product. As such, an AE can be an unfavorable or 
unintended si gn (including an abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whet her or not considered 
related to the product. The term “investigational product” for this study refers to t he two placebo 
films.  
  
Given that t he study  product is a placebo product and the product will be removed immediately 
after insertion, it is exceptionally unlikely that any adverse events wi ll be noted during the single  
visit. Nonetheless, should one occur  study site staff will document any AEs in source documents 
regardless of severity and presumed relationship to study product.   
FAME 103B ve rsion 1.0 19  07Apr2020  
The PI/designee wil l grade the severity of each AE and the r elationship of the AE to study 
product:    
AE severity will be gra ded per the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, 
Version2 .0, November  2014 and the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Mic robicide 
Studies (Appendix  1 to the DAIDS  Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, 
Version 2.0, Dece mber 2014). AEs not included i n the Fe male Genital Grading Table will be 
graded by the DAIDS AE Grading Table Version 1.0, December 2004.  In c ases where a genital 
AE is  covered in bot h tables, the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide S tudies 
will be the grading scale ut ilized.   
 The relationship of all AEs reported on CRFs will be assessed based on the Manual for 
Expedited Report ing of Adverse Events to D AIDS (Version 1 .0, dated January 2010) , the 
product Package Inserts and Investigat ors B rochures, and the clinical judgment of  the 
PI/designee.  
Per the Manual for Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to DAIDS, the 
relationship categories that will be used for this study  are:  
 
• Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may  be related to the 
study agent(s)  
• Not relat ed: There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the 
study agent(s)  
 
The DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pedi atric Adverse E vents, the Female Genital Grading 
Table for Use in Microbicide Stud ies, and Version 2 .0 of the Manual for Expe dited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS  are available on the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center (RSC) web 
site:   http://rsc.tech -res.com/  
All AEs  will be captured on an AE log form.  
 8.3 Criteria for Early Terminat ion of  Study Participation  
 Particip ants may  voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. The Site 
PI/designee also may withdraw participants from the study  to protect the ir safety and/or if they 
are unwilling or unable to comply with req uired study procedures.   
9 Statistic al Consi derations  
 
9.1 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
The primary aim of the study is to assess  proper placement of two vaginal placebo films 
containing two levels of polymer. Secondary aims are to gather women’s preference and 
experiences through questionnaire and discussi on.    
 
In a previous cross -over study of placebo film products, the proportion of 32 women that 
misplace d a 2” x  2” cellulose film  was 41% and 78 % misplaced a 1” x 2” film product, with 50% 
placement concordance between the two films. Twenty -five women will have 80% power to 
determine whether there is a difference between polymer types of vaginal placebo fil ms based 
on a McNemar’s test evaluated at  the .05 significance level. The sample size of 30 women will 
allow for additional input regarding challenges.  
 
FAME 103B ve rsion 1.0 20  07Apr2020 9.2 Statistical analyses  
 
McNemar’s test will be used to assess differences in the proportion of misplaced films, defined 
as partial or unable to in sert the vaginal film product based on visual assessment. McNemar’ s 
test will also be used to assess differenc es in preference for the two film products. Conditional 
logistic regression will be used to assess whether demographic characterist ics such as age, 
race, and BMI are associated with product placement or product pr efere nce.  Descriptive 
statistics w ill be u sed to summarize participants’ challenges with self -insertion of the film 
products.  
 9.3 Blinding  
 
All partic ipants will receive a single vaginal film  containing high level and low  level Eudragit® 
content placebo fil ms. Th ey will be blinded to the form ulation with respect to Eudragit® content 
and the sequence of insertion. Evaluators of the study endpoints will also be blinded to the film  
formulation and sequence of insertion.  
 
9.4 Random assignment  
 
The randomization sc heme w ill be generated and maintained by a m ember of the Data 
Management Center at the study site and supplied to the Pharmacy.  Women will be random ized to the sequence of insertion of the two films, low followed by high Eudragit® content 
or high followed by lo w Eudragit® content in a 1:1 r atio usi ng a permuted block design with 
random block sizes of 2 and 4.  In order to minimize bias in group assignment, participants will be given study identification numbers.  A study staff member will allot the identif icatio n numbers 
in sequential order as parti cipants become eligible to enroll in the study. Participants will be 
randomized using REDCap’s randomizat ion module to obtain the s equence of product insertion. 
The film product will be labeled in order to mask t he Eudragit® content to the participants and  
study staff. The randomization scheme will be created for a total of 34 participants ; the overage 
will b e created to compensate for participant withdrawals or unusable products.

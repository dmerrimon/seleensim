10(178)PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
A Phase II, Multi-Center, Open-Label Study of Tremelimumab 
Monotherapy in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
International Co-ordinating Investigator
Study site(s) and number of subjects planned
The study will screen up to approximately 38 patients with each  selected advanced solid 
tumor type in order to enroll approximately 32 evaluable patient s with each tumor type who 
will receive tremelimumab monotherapy, with the option for elig ible patients to be sequenced 
to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy after 
progressive disease (PD).
Study period Phase of development
Estimated date of first subject enrolled Q4 2015 II
Estimated date of last subject completed Q2 2018 II
Study design
This is an open-label, multi-center study to determine the effi cacy and safety of tremelimumab 
monotherapy in the treatment of different cohorts of patients w ith selected advanced solid 
tumors.  If eligible and at the discretion of the Investigator,  after confirmed disease 
progression on tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up, pa tients will have the option 
of being sequenced to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremel imumab combination 
therapy, for up to 12 months or until disease progression, whic hever comes sooner.  For each 
tumor cohort, a minimax Simon 2-Stage design will be used to st op recruitment early if no 
response is observed in the first stage and thus reduce patient  exposure to non-active 
treatment.  If 1 or more responses are observed in the first 20  treated patients with the selected 
tumor type, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled, for a t otal of 32 evaluable patients.  If 
no responses are observed, the disease control rate (DCR) data will also be evaluated to make
a final decision before discontinuing the tumor cohort.  If at least 10 out of the first 20 patients 
achieve DCR (≥50% DCR) after 2 tumor assessments, then an addit ional 12 patients may be 
enrolled, for a total of 32 evaluable patients.  Patients’ tumo r response and DCR will be 
monitored on an ongoing basis in order to minimize the time bet ween Stage 1 and Stage 2.PPD

Target subject population 
Adult patients (age ≥18 years) with advanced and metastatic solid tumors including but not 
limited to histologically or cytologically documented UBC, PDAC , or TNBC(Additional 
tumor types may be added at the discretion of the Sponsor.)  
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with tremelimumab monotherapy will continue for a 12- month period until 
confirmed PD (unless there is continued clinical benefit per In vestigator judgment), 
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, initiation of alt ernative anticancer therapy, or 
other reasons to discontinue treatment occur.  After confirmed disease progression during 
treatment with tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up, pa tients who meet the 
eligibility criteria for sequencing (see Section 7.2.3), at the  discretion of the Investigator, may 
be sequenced to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab  combination 
therapy for up to 12 months or until disease progression, which ever comes sooner.  Treatment 
with sequenced therapy will begin not less than 42 days and not  more than 120 days after the 
last dose of tremelimumab monotherapy.  For patients who have c onfirmed PD during the 
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D4884C00001 Version 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
13 (178) tremelimumab monotherapy follow-up period, treatment with seque nced therapy will begin 
not more than 60 days after confirmed progression.  These patie nts will follow similar 
assessment schedules to those followed during the initial treme limumab monotherapy 
treatment period.  Crossover from the MEDI4736 monotherapy grou p to the MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy group will not be permitted. 
Patients who complete 12 months of tremelimumab monotherapy, or  who complete 12 months 
of MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy after 
sequencing, will enter follow-up.  Any of these patients who th en develop PD during the 
follow-up period may restart their treatment for another 12 mon ths with the same treatment 
guidelines followed previously.  In addition, patients receivin g combination therapy who 
complete the 4 dosing cycles with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab (with  clinical benefit per 
Investigator judgment), but subsequently experience progression  (according to RECIST 1.1) 
during treatment with MEDI4736 alone, will be given the option to restart MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy (see Section 7.2.2).  All pati ents who restart treatment 
will receive a maximum of 12 months of further treatment.  Pati ents who have discontinued 
study treatment will enter long-term follow-up.  
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration 
Tremelimumab monotherapy: 
Tremelimumab 750 mg via intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks  (q4w) for 7 doses 
(cycles), then q12w for 2 additional doses (cycles), for up to a total of 12 months (9 doses 
[cycles] total) 
MEDI4736 monotherapy: 
MEDI4736 1.5 g via IV infusion q4w for up to a total of 12 mont hs (13 doses [cycles]) 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy: 
Tremelimumab 75 mg via IV infusion q4w starting on Week 0, for up to 4 cycles 
MEDI4736 1.5 g via IV infusion q4w, starting on Week 0, for up to a total of 4 cycles, 
followed by MEDI4736 1.5 g via IV infusion q4w, starting on Wee k 16, for up to a total of 8 
months (9 additional doses [cycles]) 
Statistical methods 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy o f tremelimumab monotherapy in 
terms of objective response rate (ORR).  ORR (per RECIST 1.1 as  assessed by site 
Investigator) is defined as the number (%) of patients with a c onfirmed complete response or 
confirmed partial response and will be based on all treated pat ients with measurable disease at 
baseline per site Investigator and will be estimated for each s elected solid tumor with 
corresponding 2- sided 95% exact confidence intervals. 
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D4884C00001 Version 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
14 (178) It is estimated that a total of 38 patients in each cohort of s elected advanced solid tumor type 
need to be screened to enroll approximately 32 evaluable patien ts (ie, evaluable for the 
primary endpoint). 
A minimax Simon 2-Stage design (Simon 1989) will be used accord ing to the following 
assumptions and algorithms to reduce exposure of a large number  of patients to ineffective 
treatment. 
Assumptions: 
H0: p0=0.02 (p0: proportion of responders under the null hypoth esis) 
H1: p1=0.14 (p1: proportion of responders under the alternate h ypothesis) 
Algorithm: 
N=32 evaluable patients, with N 1=20 and N 2=12 
If no response is observed out of the first 20 patients, the DC R data will also be evaluated to 
make a final decision before discontinuing the tumor cohort.  ( Ongoing patients will still be 
eligible to sequence to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + trem elimumab combination 
therapy as previously described.)  If ≥10 out of the first 20 patients achieve DCR ( ≥50% 
DCR) after 2 tumor assessments, then an additional 12 patients may be enrolled.  A final 
decision to continue enrollment will be made by the Sponsor aft er evaluating all of the 
available clinical data at that time. 
If 1 or more responses are observed out of the first 20 patient s, enroll 12 additional patients, 
for a total of 32 evaluable patients in each tumor type. 
x If ≤2 responses are observed out of the 32 patients, then no furthe r investigation of 
that tumor type will be done. 
x If >2 responses are observed out of the 32 patients, the null h ypothesis will be 
rejected, and further investigation of that tumor type is warra nted. 
The assessment of response after the first 20 evaluable patient s in the selected tumor types 
will be based on Investigator/site tumor data RECIST 1.1 assess ment.  This design will ensure 
a type I error of no more than 5% (1-sided) and 83% power for e ach selected tumor type. 
Secondary efficacy variables include duration of response (DoR) , DCR, progression-free 
survival (PFS), best objective response (BoR), and overall surv ival (OS).  Efficacy data w ill 
be summarized and analyzed based on the Full Analysis Set. 
The data cut-off for the primary analysis of all study endpoint s including OS, will take pl ace 
approximately 12 months after the last patient completes 12 mon ths of initial Treme 
Monotherapy, or the last patient has withdrawn from the study, or the study is discontinued by 
the Sponsor. A final data cut-off of OS and safety will be cond ucted approximately 6 months 
after the primary analysis data cut-off.

15 (178) Kaplan-Meier plots and median DoR, PFS, and OS will be presente d.  Also, summaries (ie, 
number of patients [%]) of PFS, death events, and DCR will be p rovided. 
The analysis of ORR, DoR, DCR, BoR, and PFS will be based on si te Investigator 
assessments according to RECIST 1.1 using all scans regardless of whether they were 
scheduled or not. 
In the tremelimumab monotherapy arm only, sensitivity analyses of ORR, DoR, DCR, and 
BoR may be performed based on site Investigator assessment acco rding to RECIST 1.1 
modified for confirmation of progression.

1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study 
1.1.1 Cancer and immune function 
The connection between cancer and the immune system was first u ncovered nearly 100 years 
ago, long before an in-depth knowledge of the intricate working s of the immune system 
existed (Cancer Research Institute 2003).  Failure of immune su rveillance of pre-neoplastic 
lesions and micro-metastases is a key step in cancer developmen t.  Chronically 
immunosuppressed individuals sho w higher rates of cancer.  This  observation led to the 
hypothesis that sporadic cancers among immunocompetent individu als are likely to be 
minimally immunogenic, allowing for passive escape from immune surveillance.  Recent data 
suggest that this may be an oversimplification.  Some sporadic tumors are highly 
immunogenic but actively suppress the local immune environment through production of 
immunosuppressive cytokines (Shields et al 2010).  As such, the  local tumor environment is 
likely a highly dynamic environment where most tumors grow and metastasize through 
adaptive responses that modulate antitumor immunity. 
The complexity and redundancy of the immune system offer multip le targets that may be 
manipulated to maximize the body’s inherent immune response to a tumor.  Immune response 
may be augmented by direct stimulation of effector cells; incre ased antigen presentation 
leading to indirect stimulation of effector cells or co-stimula tion; or by suppressing 
immunosuppressive factors, cells, or transcription (Monti et al  2005). 
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have the capacity to cont rol the growth of many types 
of cancers (Gooden et al 2011).  Most tumors show infiltration by TILs, but tumors modulate 
the local micro-environment through surface expression or relea se of inhibitory molecules.  
Engagement of TIL cell surface receptors with these inhibitory ligands leads to a 
dysfunctional immune response, causes T-cell exhaustion, and fa cilitates tumor progression 
(Baitsch et al 2012, Crespo et a l 2013) .  Novel monoclonal anti bodies (mAbs) that block these 
inhibitory receptors have shown significant clinical activity a cross a number of tumor types 
(Brahmer et al 2010, Hodi et al 2010, Robert et al 2011, Topali an et al 2012, Wolchok et al 
2009).  Specifically, blockade of immune checkpoint signaling, through cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death  1 (PD-1), and 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), has shown clinical acti vity not only in 
conventionally immune-responsive tumors, such as melanoma and r enal cell carcinoma, but 
also in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; Brahmer et al 2010, Brahmer et al 2012, Gordon 
et al 2013, Topalian et al 2012), prostate cancer (Harzstark an d Small 2010, Slovin et al 
2013), mesothelioma (Calabrò et al 2013), and other solid tumor s (Brahmer et al 2010, 
Brahmer et al 2012, Gordon et al 2013). 
1.1.2 Tremelimumab 
Tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 mAb of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2 kapp a isotype, is an 
immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) that is being developed by Astra Zeneca/MedImmune for 
use in the treatment of cancer.  (MedImmune is a wholly owned s ubsidiary of AstraZeneca;

Study Code D4884C00001 Version 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
28 (178) AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as AstraZeneca throug hout this document.)  
Tremelimumab blocks the inhibitory signal resulting from CTLA-4  binding to B7, leading to 
indirect prolongation and enhancement of T-cell activation and expansion. 
An extensive program of non-clinical and clinical studies has b een conducted for 
tremelimumab, both as monotherapy and combination therapy with conventional anticancer 
agents, to support various cancer indications using different d ose schedules.  As of the data 
cut-off date of 12 November 2014 (for all studies except Study D4190C00006, which has a 
cut-off date of 4 December 2014), 973 patients have received tr emelimumab monotherapy 
(not including 497 patients who have been treated in the blinde d Phase IIb study, 
D4880C00003) and 208 patients have received tremelimumab in com bination with other 
agents.  More than 800 of these patients had melanoma and were treated at a dose of 15 mg/kg 
every 90 days.  Details on the safety profile of tremelimumab m onotherapy are summarized in 
Section 1.3.2.1.  Refer to the tremelimumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a complete 
summary of non-clinical and clinical information; see Section 6 .8 for guidance on 
management of tremelimumab-related toxicities. 
Tremelimumab exhibited a biphasic pharmacokinetic (PK) profile with a long terminal phase 
half-life of 22 days.  Overall, a low incidence of anti-drug an tibodies (ADAs; <6%) was 
observed in treatment with tremelimumab. 
1.1.3 MEDI4736 
MEDI4736 is a human mAb of the IgG 1 kappa subclass that inhibi ts binding of PD-L1 and is 
being developed by AstraZeneca for use in the treatment of canc er.  The proposed mechanism 
of action for MEDI4736 is interference of the interaction of PD -L1, expressed on cancer cells 
and a subset of leukocytes, with the PD-1 (cluster of different iation [CD] 279) and B7-1 
(CD80) molecules on antigen-presenting cells and T cells.  By b inding to PD-L1 on tumor 
cells, the mechanism of action of MEDI4736 inc ludes stimulation of the patient’s antitumor 
immune response. 
MEDI4736 has been given to humans as monotherapy or in combinat ion with other drugs as 
part of ongoing stud ies.  As of 14 July 2014, 509 patients have  been enrolled and treated in 10 
ongoing clinical studies on MEDI4736 (with 5 studies using MEDI 4736 as monotherapy and 
5 studies using MEDI4736 as combination therapy).  No studies h ave yet been completed. 
Details on the safety profile of MEDI4736 monotherapy are summa rized in Section 1.3.2.2. 
Refer to the MEDI4736 IB for a complete summary of non-clinical  and clinical information; 
see Section 6.8 for guidance on management of MEDI4736-related toxicities. 
MEDI4736 monotherapy exhibits non-linear (dose-dependent) PK ap proaching linearity with 
the ≥3 -mg/kg dose, likely due to saturable target-mediated clearance,  and has a half-life of 
approximately 21 days.  As of 14 July 2014, of the 220 patients  who received MEDI4736 
monotherapy for whom PK/ADA data were available from Study CD- ON-MEDI4736-1108 
(referred to hereafter as Study 1108), 5 patients (1 patient ea ch in the 0.1- and 3-mg/kg dose 
cohorts and 3 patients in 10-mg/kg dose cohort) were detected t o be ADA positive, with an 
impact on PK/pharmacodynamics in 1 patient in the 3-mg/kg dose cohort.

Date 13 Sep 2018 
29 (178) 1.1.4 MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab 
Targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways may have additive or sy nergistic activity (Pardoll 
2012) because the mechanisms of action of CTLA-4 and PD-1 are n on-redundant; therefore, 
AstraZeneca is also investigating the use of MEDI4736 + tremeli mumab combination therapy 
for the treatment of cancer. 
Study D4190C00006 is a Phase Ib dose-escalation study to establ ish safety, 
PK/pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of MEDI 4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.  The dosin g schedule utilized is 
MEDI4736 every 2 weeks (q2w) or every 4 weeks (q4w) up to Week 48 (12 months), 
combined with tremelimumab q4w up to Week 24 for 7 doses, then tremelimumab every 12 
weeks (q12w) for 2 additional d oses for up to 12 months.  The s tudy is ongoing and continues 
to accrue. 
As of 15 April 2015, a total of 102 patients have been treated in the study, including 74 
patients on the q4w dosing schedule and 28 patients on the q2w dosing schedule.  Details on 
the safety profile of the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination t herapy are summarized in 
Sections 1.2.2.3 and 1.3.2.3.  Refer to the current MEDI4736 IB  and tremelimumab IB for a 
complete summary of non-clinical and clinical information; see Section 6.8 for guidance on 
management of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy-relat ed toxicities. 
As of 27 January 2015 in Study D4190C00006, an approximately do se-proportional increase 
in PK exposure (maximum plasma concentration [C max], trough plasma concentration [C trough], 
and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve from ti me 0 to Day 28 post-dose 
[AUC (0-28)day ]) of both MEDI4736 and tremelimumab was observed over the dose  range of 3 
to 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 q4w or q2w and 1 to 10 mg/kg tremelimumab q4w.  Four of 60 
patients were ADA positive for either anti-MEDI4736 or anti-tre melimumab antibodies post-
treatment; MEDI4736 PK was impacted in only 2 of these 4 patien ts.  Complete soluble PD 
L1 (sPD-L1) suppression (surrogate for PD-L1 targeting) was obs erved in almost all patients 
over the dose range of 3 to 20 mg/kg of MEDI4736 q4w or q2w. 
1.1.5 Rationale for conducting this study 
Tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4-targeting agent that blocks the in teraction with CD80 and 
CD86, may help prolong and enhance T-cell activation and expans ion.  This hypothesis is 
supported by emerging clinical data from both tremelimumab stud ies (Kirkwood et al 2010, 
Ribas et al 2013) and studies with a related anti-CTLA-4 antibo dy, ipilimumab.  Responses 
with CTLA-4-targeted drugs have been documented across a variet y of tumor types. 
MEDI4736, an antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-L1  and its receptors, may 
relieve PD-L1-dependent immunosuppressive effects and, therefor e, enhance the cytotoxic 
activity of antitumor T cells.  This hypothesis is supported by  emerging clinical data from 
other mAbs targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway, which provide earl y evidence of clinical 
activity and a manageable safety profile (Brahmer et al 2012, T opalian et al 2012).  In 
addition, although clinical experience with MEDI4736 is limited , currently available data

30 (178) from Study 1108 indicate encouraging response rates and duratio n of response (DoR) with a 
manageable safety profile in patients with a variety of solid t umors. 
Based on the preliminary clinical efficacy and safety data obse rved in patients with solid 
tumors who received MEDI4736 in Study 1108 and MEDI4736 + treme limumab combination 
therapy in Study D4190C00006, the Sponsor plans a comprehensive  development program of 
MEDI4736 monotherapy and MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination th erapy in select 
advanced solid tumor indications.  The objectives of this progr am are to determine the activity 
of MEDI4736 as monotherapy in patients with select advanced sol id tumors and to establish 
the role of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab and other  investigational agents 
and therapies in patients with these select advanced solid tumo rs.  As tremelimumab 
monotherapy has not previously been investigated in a populatio n of patients with many of 
these tumor types, the objective of this clinical trial is to d etermine the activity of 
tremelimumab as monotherapy in patients with these tumors and t o determine the efficacy and 
safety of sequenced MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelim umab combination 
therapy after confirmed progression on tremelimumab monotherapy  or during follow-up.  To 
our knowledge, there are limited data on the efficacy of MEDI47 36 monotherapy or 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy after failure of tr emelimumab monotherapy 
in the selected tumor types.  In melanoma, responses with PD 1/ PD-L1-targeted drugs occur 
after progression on anti-CTLA-4 therapy (Weber et al 2015).  P D-1-based therapy has been 
shown to have a unique T-cell gene expression pattern when comp ared to CTLA-4, with 
minor overlap.  The sequential administration of anti-CTLA-4 an d anti PD 1 therapies led to 
increased T-cell gene expression (Das et al 2015). 
These rationales support the proposed investigation of tremelim umab monotherapy with 
subsequent treatment with either MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI47 36 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy in eligible patients in a single-arm Phase II setting in select advanced 
solid tumors as outlined in this Clinical Study Protocol (CSP).   (Additional tumor types may 
be added at the discretion of the Sponsor.)  Data generated fro m this study may also be used to 
demonstrate the contribution of components from a novel drug co mbination (tremelimumab 
and MEDI4736) with regard to other studies (ie, objective respo nse rate [ORR], progression-
free survival [PFS]). 
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups 
1.2.1 Tumor type selection rationale 
This study will be conducted in adult patients (aged ≥18 years)  with advanced and metastatic 
solid tumors including but not limited to histologically or cyt ologically documented urothelial 
bladder cancer (UBC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), or triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) (see Section 3.1).  Additional tumor types may be  added at the discretion of 
the Sponsor. 
There remains a significant unmet medical need for additional t reatment options for patients 
with UBC who have failed first-line platinum-based (ie, cisplat in or carboplatin) 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.  To date, no standard t herapy has been established for

31 (178) patients who recur or are refractory to first-line therapy (NCC N Bladder Cancer Guidelines 
Version 2.2014).  Several lines of evidence documenting the imm une dysfunction associated 
with bladder cancer support the hypothesis that immunotherapy can alter the process of 
carcinogenesis (Carneiro et al 2014). 
A study treating patients with localized UBC and with a brief e xposure to ipilimumab, an anti 
CTLA-4 antibody, prior to surgery was associated with an increa sed frequency of 
CD4+ICOShi T cells in the systemic circulation and bladder tissue.  The s ame study analyzed 
a subset cohort of patients with metastatic melanoma and demons trated that increased 
frequency of CD4+ICOShi T cells sustained over a period of 12 weeks correlated with an  
increased likelihood of overall survival (OS) (Carthon et al 20 10).  Additionally, a study 
involving MPDL3280A, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, reported 30 of the  87 patients with UBC, 
who progressed following platinum-based first-line therapy, had  responses, including 9 with 
complete response (CR) and 21 with partial response (PR) in pat ients (Petrylak et al 2015). 
A significant unmet medical need also exists for additional tre atment options for patients with 
advanced pancreatic cancer who have failed 5-fluorouracil (FU)- containing or gemcitabine-
containing first-line chemotherapy.  Several lines of evidence documenting the immune 
dysfunction associated with PDAC support the hypothesis that im munotherapy can alter the 
process of carcinogenesis (Fokas et al 2014).  Treatment with s ingle agent ipilimumab at a 
dose of 3 mg/kg demonstrated a significant delayed response in 1 patient, suggesting that 
immunotherapy may have an eff ect in PDAC (Roya l et al 2010) .  Furthermore, the 
combination of anti-PD-L1 mAb and gemcitabine exhibited a signi ficant synergistic effect on 
murine pancreatic cancer and resulted in CR without overt toxic ity (Nomi et al 2007).  Other 
studies have demonstrated that clinical responses to immunother apy in PDAC may require 
prolonged treatments (Dung et al 2013). 
Additionally, there remains a significant unmet medical need fo r additional treatment options 
for patients with triple-negative breast cancer who have failed  chemotherapy.  Several lines of 
evidence documenting the immune dysfunction associated with tri ple-negative breast cancer 
support the hypothesis that immunotherapy can alter the process  of carcinogenesis.  TILs can 
provide prognostic and potentially predictive value in triple-n egative breast cancer (Salgado et 
al 2015, Loi et al 2014).  TILs may be associated with response s to chemotherapy (Perez et al 
2014).  In KEYNOTE-012, 5 of 27 patients with TNBC had a respon se to Pembrolizumab, a 
PD-1 antibody, including 1 CR.  An additional 7 patients had st able disease (SD; 25.9%).  
Only patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (PD-L1 stromal stainin g or >1% of tumor cells) 
were enrolled (Nanda et al 2014).  In a Phase Ia study with MPD L-3280A, a PD-L1 antibody, 
3 of 9 patients with TNBC had a response.  Only patients with P D-L1-positive tumors were 
enrolled (PD-L1 positivity was assessed on TILs using immunohis tochemistry (IHC); IHC 2/3 
were considered positive [>10% TILs or 5% to 10% TILs]; Emens e t al 2014). 
1.2.2 Dose rationale 
1.2.2.1  Tremelimumab monotherapy dose rationale 
An extensive program of non-clinical and clinical studies has b een conducted for 
tremelimumab both as monotherapy and combination therapy with c onventional anticancer 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)

Date 13 Sep 2018 
32 (178) agents to support various cancer indications using different do se schedules.  A total of 22 
sponsored clinical studies have been conducted as part of the t remelimumab clinical 
development program.  Tremelimumab has been administered as a s ingle-agent treatment in 
10 of these clinical studies, 2 of which continue to follow pat ients.  In total, 973 patients with 
a variety of tumor types have been treated in these studies (no t including an ongoing Phase IIb 
study [Study D4880C00003] in patients  with mesothelioma).  In a ddition, tremelimumab in 
combination with other anticancer agents has been administered to 208 patients with a variety 
of tumor types in 12 of the 22 clinical studies, 7 of which are  ongoing. 
Across the clinical development program for tremelimumab and th at of the related anti-
CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab, a pattern of efficacy and safety ha s emerged that appears to be 
consistent across different tumor types for anti-CTLA-4 agents.   Response rates to anti-
CTLA-4 antibodies are generally low, approximately 10%; however , in patients who respond, 
the responses are often durable, lasting several months even in  patients with aggressive 
tumors, such as refractory metastatic melanoma.  The profile of  adverse events (AEs) and the 
spectrum of event severity have remained stable across the trem elimumab clinical program 
and are consistent with that of other CTLA-4 antibodies.  Addit ional details on AEs are 
available in the tremelimumab IB. 
The target trough concentration of tremelimumab is estim ated to be approximately 30 μg/mL, 
based on enhanced interleukin (IL)-2 release (in vitro) and ant itumor activity (in vivo) in 
preclinical studies.  PK simulations indicate that, following a  dose of 10 mg/kg q4w for 6 
months, approximately 90% of patients are expected to be above this target level of 30 μg/mL 
during the induction phase.  Tremelimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg  q4w for 6 months followed 
by 10 mg/kg every 90 days is expected to yield PK exposures sim ilar to those of the related 
anti-CTLA-4 mAb ipilimumab, given at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 3  weeks (q3w) for 4 cycles 
(12 weeks) followed by 10 mg/kg every 3 months (beginning on We ek 24), the dosing 
regimen that was tested in the pivotal first-line melanoma tria l (Robert et al 2011). 
Retrospective analyses of the Phase I and II tremelimumab melan oma studies show an 
improvement in OS for patients who were able to achieve a highe r tremelimumab exposure, as 
measured by the area under the plasma drug concentration-time c urve (AUC).  The median 
OS was significantly longer in the high-AUC group (15.3 months;  N=164) versus the low-
AUC group (6.0 months; N=163) (based on the median value of AUC  [103570 μg•h/mL]).  
This difference in OS corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.4 1 (p<0.001), and the estimated 
survival rates in these 2 groups were 59% versus 29%, respectiv ely, at 1 year.  Additionally, a 
retrospective exposure and survival analysis of 293 patients tr eated with tremelimumab in a 
Phase III study in patients with melanoma showed better OS in p atients with higher exposure.  
The median OS was 18.4 months for the high- AUC group (≥123665 μg•h/mL) compared to 
9.0 months for the low- AUC group (<123665 μg•h/mL) (HR 0.5; p<0 .001).  Tremelimumab 
monotherapy at a dose of 750 mg q4w for 7 doses (cycles) follow ed by 750 mg q12w for 2 
additional doses (cycles) is equivalent to 10 mg/kg tremelimuma b monotherapy with the same 
dosing schedule. Therefore, the current study will use a dosing  regimen of 750 mg q4w for 7 
doses followed by 750 mg q12w for 2 doses to maximize exposure to tremelimumab while 
managing safety according to established guidelines.

33 (178) As of DCO date (12 July 2017), approximately 1617 patients have been expo sed to one or 
more doses of tremelimumab monotherapy across the program (see tremelimumab IB version 
8 dated 02 Nov 2017).  Clinical experience has not resulted in material changes to the clinical

1.2.2.2  MEDI4736 monotherapy dose rationale 
A dose of MEDI4736 20 mg/kg q4w is supported by in vitro data, non-clinical activity, 
clinical PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, and activity data fro m Study 1108 in patients 
with advanced solid tumors (ongoing first-time-in-humans study)  and from a Phase I trial 
performed in Japanese patients with solid tumors ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data 
Based on available PK/pharmacodynamic data from ongoing Study 1 108 with doses ranging 
from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w, MEDI4736 exhibited no n-linear (dose 
dependent) PK consistent with target-mediated drug disposition.   The PK approached linearity 
at ≥3 mg/kg q2w, suggesting near complete target saturation (me mbrane -bound and sPD-L1), 
and further shows that the MEDI4736 dosing frequency can be ada pted to a particular 
regimen, given the linearity seen at higher doses than 3 mg/kg.   The expected half-life with 
doses ≥3 mg/kg q2w is approximately 21 days.  A dose -dependent suppression in peripheral 
sPD-L1 was observed over the dose range studied, consistent wit h engagement of MEDI4736 
with PD-L1.  Dose-related changes in a variety of peripheral bi omarkers have been observed 
over the dose range of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg.  A low level of immunog enicity has been observed.  
No patients have experienced immune-complex disease following e xposure to MEDI4736.  Of 
the 220 patients who received MEDI4736 monotherapy and for whom  PK/ADA data were 
available as of 14 July 2014, 5 patients were ADA positive, wit h an impact on 
PK/pharmacodynamics reported in 1 patient at the 3-mg/kg dose r ange. 
Data from Study D4190C00006 (Phase I trial in NSCLC patients us ing the combination of 
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab) also show an approximately dose-prop ortional increase in PK 
exposure for MEDI4736 over the dose range of 3 to 20 mg/kg MEDI 4736 q4w or q2w.  (For 
further information on PK observations in Study D4190C00006, pl ease refer to Section 
1.2.2.3). 
The observed MEDI4736 PK data from the combination study were w ell in line with the 
predicted monotherapy PK data (5th, median, and 95th percentiles) for a q4w regimen.  (For 
further information on PK observations in Study D4190C00006, pl ease refer to Section 
1.2.2.3). 
A population PK model was developed using the data from Study 1 108 (doses of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w; Fairma n et al 2014 ).  Multiple simul ations indicate that a 
similar overall exposure is expected following both 10 mg/kg q2 w and 20 mg/kg q4w 
regimens, as represented by AUC at steady state (AUC ss; 4 weeks).  Median C max at steady 
state (C max,ss) is expected to be higher with 20 mg/kg q4w (~1.5 fold) and me dian C trough at 
steady state (C trough,ss ) is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg q2w (~1.25 fold).  Cli nical 
activity with the 20 mg/kg q4w dosing regimen is anticipated to  be consistent with 10 mg/kg

34 (178) q2w with the proposed similar dose of 20 mg/kg q4w expected to (a) achieve complete target 
saturation in majority of patients; (b) account for anticipated  variability in PK, 
pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity in diverse cancer popul ations; (c) maintain sufficient 
PK exposure in case of ADA impact; and (d) achieve PK exposure that yielded maximal 
antitumor activity in animal models. 
Given the similar AUC and modest differences in median peak and  trough levels at steady 
state, the observation that both regimens maintain complete sPD -L1 suppression at trough, 
and the available clinical data, the 20 mg/kg q4w and 10 mg/kg q2w regimens are expected to 
have similar efficacy and safety profiles, supporting further d evelopment with a dose of 20 
mg/kg q4w. 
Clinical data 
As of 8 April 2015, there is initial safety data for 16 patient s receiving the 20 mg/kg q4w 
dosing regimen (12 patients from Study 1108 and 4 patients from  the Japan Phase I trial).  The 
toxicities observed with 20 mg/kg q4w are consistent with the 1 0 mg/kg q2w regimen, and 
there were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed.  Of the  12 patients in Study 1108, 
42% of patients have experienced AEs of any grade, with 2 being  Grade 3 and above (17%).  
None of the Grade 3 and higher AEs were considered treatment re lated.  No patients on the 
Japan Phase I trial have experienced an AE Grade 3 or above.  A t present, the data do not 
suggest that the safety profile of MEDI4736 will be different i n the 20 mg/kg q4w dosing 
regimen when compared to 10 mg/kg q2w dosing regimen.  As of 14  July 2014, 393 patients 
enrolled in Study 1108 have received MEDI4736, predominantly at  10 mg/kg q2w (either in 
the dose-escalation or dose-expansion phase of the study).  Dat a presented at the European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting 2014 with a later c utoff date of 21 August 
2014 showed that MEDI4736 was well tolerated at all doses in th e subset of patients with 
NSCLC enrolled into Study 1108, with drug- related Grade ≥3 AE s reported in 3% of patients 
and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation reported in 1% of patients.  No drug-related 
colitis or hyperglycemia of any grade, Grade ≥3 pneumonitis, or  drug -related AEs leading to 
death were reported (Antonia et al 2014).  No DLTs were observe d up to a dose of 10 mg/kg 
q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w. 
Efficacy data on the patients with NSCLC in Study 1108, present ed at ESMO 2014 (cutoff 
date of 21 August 2014), showed a disease control rate (DCR) at  12 weeks of 41% and an 
ORR of 16% among 162 evaluable patients, with activity observed  in both squamous and 
non-squamous histologies.  The ORR was higher (25%; 12 CR/PR; n =48) in patients with 
PD-L1 posi tive tumors, defined as those with ≥25% of tumor cells with mem brane staining for 
PD-L1, compared to patients with PD-L1-negative tumors (10%; 7 CR/PR; n=74) (Antonia et 
al 2014). 
As of the DCO date (12 July 2017), across the entire clinical d evelopment program, an 
estimated 4067 patients have been exposed to 1 or more doses of  durvalumab in Phase I to III 
studies, either as monotherapy or in combination, and 5911 pati ents where the treatment arm 
is blinded. Additionally, approximately 4000 patients have been  exposed to 1 or more doses of 
durvalumab in ESR/IITs (see Appendix B Table 46 in MEDI4736 IB version 12 dated 03 Nov

any completed clinical trials and the enrolment/randomisation s chemes for ongoing open label 
and blinded trials are: 3723 patients received durvalumab monot herapy, 3372 patients 
received durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab. The total  post-marketing exposure 
to durvalumab from May 2017 to the 12 July 2017 was estimated t o be approximately 1.46 
patient-years.  Clinical experience has not resulted in material changes to the  clinical AE 
profile or to the TMGs. Refer to updated TMGs in Appendix E 
1.2.2.3  MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy dose rationale 
The MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy doses and regim en selected for this 
study are based on the goal of selecting an optimal combination  dose of MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab that would yield sustained target suppression (sPD -L1), demonstrate promising 
efficacy, and have an acceptable safety profile. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data 
In order to reduce the dosing frequency of MEDI4736 to align wi th the q4w dosing of 
tremelimumab while ensuring an acceptable PK/pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy 
profile, cohorts in Study D4190C00006 were narrowed to 15 and 2 0 mg/kg MEDI4736 q4w. 
PK simulations from the MEDI4736 monotherapy data indicated tha t a similar AUC ss (4 
weeks) was expected following both 10 mg/kg q2w and 20 mg/kg q4 w MEDI4736.  The 
observed MEDI4736 PK data from Study D4190C00006 were well in l ine with the predicted 
monotherapy PK data developed preclinically.  This demonstrates  similar exposure of 
MEDI4736 20 mg/kg q4w and 10 mg/kg q2w, with no alterations in PK when MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab (doses ranging from 1 to 3 mg/kg) are dosed togeth er.  While the median 
Cmax,ss is expected to be higher with 20 mg/kg q4w (~1.5 fold) and medi an C trough,ss is expected 
to be higher with 10 mg/kg q2w (~1.25 fold), this is not expect ed to impact the overall safety 
and efficacy profile, based on existing preclinical and clinica l data. 
Monotonic increases in pharmacodynamic activity were observed w ith increasing doses of 
tremelimumab relative to the activity observed in patients trea ted with MEDI4736 
monotherapy.  There was evidence of augmented pharmacodynamic a ctivity relative to 
MEDI4736 monotherapy with combination doses containing 1 mg/kg tremelimumab, 
inclusive of both the 15 and 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremel imumab combinations. 
Clinical data 
As of 15 April 2015, a total of 102 patients with advanced NSCL C have been treated in Study 
D4190C00006 .  Various dose combinations were explored, with dos es of tremelimumab 
ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg and doses of MEDI4736 ranging from 3  to 20 mg/kg.  A total of 
74 of these patients were in the q4w dosing schedule, and 28 pa tients were in the q2w dosing 
schedule, with the goal of identifying the dose combination tha t best optimizes the benefit: 
risk profile in an acceptable range of PK and pharmacodynamic v alues. 
Patients treated with doses of tremelimumab above 1 mg/kg had a  higher incidence of AEs, 
including Grade 3 or 4 AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and se rious AEs (SAEs).  Between

36 (178) the 10-mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1-mg/kg tremelimumab and 10-mg/kg MEDI4 736 + 3-mg/kg 
tremelimumab dose cohorts treated at the q2w schedule, the numb er of patients reporting any 
AE, Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment-related AEs was higher in the 10-mg/kg MEDI4736 + 
3-mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort than in the 10-mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1-mg/kg 
tremelimumab dose cohort.  A similar pattern was noted in the q 4w regimens, suggesting that, 
as the dose of tremelimumab increased above 1 mg/kg, a higher r ate of treatment-related 
events may be anticipated.  Further, the SAEs frequently attrib uted to immunotherapy, 
pneumonitis, and colitis were more commonly seen in cohorts usi ng either 3 or 10 mg/kg of 
tremelimumab compared to the cohorts using 1-mg/kg of tremelimu mab.  Together, these data 
suggest that tremelimumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg appeared to mini mize the rate of toxicity 
when combined with MEDI4736.  As a result, all combination dose s utilizing either the 3- or 
10-mg/kg doses of tremelimumab were eliminated in the final dos e selection. 
In contrast, cohorts assessing higher doses of MEDI4736 with a constant dose of 
tremelimumab did not show an increase in the incidence of AEs.  The data suggested that 
increasing doses of MEDI4736 may not impact the safety of the c ombination as much as the 
tremelimumab dose.  Further, safety data between the 10- and 20 -mg/kg dose cohorts were 
similar, with a similar safety profile observed between the 10-  and 20-mg/kg dose cohorts. 
In Study D4190C00006, of all treatment cohorts, the cohort of 1 8 patients treated in the 20 
mg/kg MEDI4736 q4w + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab group had the lowest incidence of AEs and 
treatment discontinuations due to AEs, second lowest incidence of any Grade ≥3 AEs, and 
third lowest incidence of SAEs, but still showed strong evidenc e of clinical activity.  This 
cohort had a lower percentage of treatment- related Grade ≥3 AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation. 
Preliminary clinical activity of the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab co mbination did not appear to 
change with increasing doses of tremelimumab.  The 10-, 15-, an d 20-mg/kg MEDI4736 q4w 
dose cohorts at all doses of tremelimumab and the 10-mg/kg MEDI 4726 q2w + 3-mg/kg 
tremelimumab dose cohort demonstrated objective responses. 
Efficacy data suggested that the 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tr emelimumab dose cohort 
may demonstrate equivalent clinical activity to other dose comb inations.  All 8 patients in the 
20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort were evalu able for efficacy with 
at least 16 weeks of follow-up.  Of these, there were 4 patient s (50%) with ORR and 4 patients 
(50%) with durable clinical response (CR, PR, or SD). 
Additionally, of all cohorts, the 20 mg/kg MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg t remelimumab dose cohort 
had the fewes t AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment discontinuations due t o AEs, but still 
showed some evidence of clinical activity.  All together, the d ata suggested that a 20 mg/kg 
(approximately 1.5 g) MEDI4736 + 1 mg/kg (approximately 75 mg) tremelimumab dose 
combination should be selected for further development. 
 
As of the DCO date (12 July 2017), across the entire clinical d evelopment program, an 
estimated 4067 patients have been exposed to 1 or more doses of  durvalumab in Phase I to III 
studies, either as monotherapy or in combination, and 5911 pati ents where the treatment arm

37 (178) is blinded. Additionally, approximately 4000 patients have been  exposed to 1 or more doses of 
durvalumab in ESR/IITs (see Appendix B Table 46 in MEDI4736 IB version 12 dated 03 Nov 
2017). Estimates of overall cumulative patient exposure based o n actual exposure data from 
any completed clinical trials and the enrolment/randomisation s chemes for ongoing open label 
and blinded trials are: 3723 patients received durvalumab monot herapy, 3372 patients 
received durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab. The total  post-marketing exposure 
to durvalumab from May 2017 to the 12 July 2017 was estimated t o be approximately 1.46 
patient-years.  Clinical experience has not resulted in material changes to the  clinical AE 
profile or to the TMGs. Refer to updated TMGs in Appendix E. 
1.2.2.4  Rationale for 4 cycles of combination therapy followed by MEDI4 736 
monotherapy 
Long-term follow-up on melanoma patients treated with ipilimuma b, an anti-CTLA-4 
targeting antibody (dosed q3w for 4 doses and then discontinued ), shows that patients 
responding to ipilimumab derive long-term benefit, with a 3-yea r OS rate of approximately 
22%.  Furthermore, the survival curve in this population reache d a plateau at 3 years and was 
maintained through 10 years of follow-up (Schadendorf et al 201 3). 
Similar data have been presented for other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targ eting antibodies: 
x Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) was dosed q2w for up to 96 weeks in a lar ge Phase I 
dose-escalation and expansion study, and showed responses were maintained for a 
median of 22.94 months for melanoma (doses 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/k g), 17 months 
for NSCLC (doses 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), and 12.9 months for renal  cell carcinoma 
patients (doses 1 and 10 mg/kg) at the time of data analysis (B rahmer et al 2014, 
Hodi et al 2014, Drake et al 2013 ).  Furthermore, responses wer e maintained 
beyond treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients wh o stopped 
nivolumab treatment (either due to protocol specified end of tr eatment, CR, or 
toxicity) for up to 56 weeks at the time of data analysis (Topa lian et al 2014). 
x MPDL3280a monotherapy (anti-PD-L1) and the combination of nivol umab with 
ipilimumab, in which patients were dosed for a finite time peri od and responses 
maintained beyond treatment discontinuation have been reported (Herbst et al 2013, 
Wolchok et al 2013). 
Similar long term results may be expected with use of other imm une-mediated cancer 
therapeutics including anti-CTLA-4 antibodies such as tremelimu mab, anti PD-L1 antibodies 
such as MEDI4736, or the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination. 
The MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy regimen will be  administered for 4 
cycles followed by monotherapy MEDI4736 1.5 g q4w. 
1.2.2.5  Rationale for fixed dosing 
A population PK model was developed for MEDI4736 using monother apy data from Study 
1108 (Phase I study; N=292; doses=0.1 to 10 mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/ kg q3w; solid tumors).  
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Version 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
38 (178) Population PK analysis indicated only a minor impact of body we ight on the PK of 
MEDI4736 (coefficient of ≤0.5).  The impact of body weight -based (10 mg/kg q2w) and fixed 
dosing (750 mg q2w) regimens of MEDI4736 was evaluated by compa ring predicted steady 
state PK concentrations (5th, median, and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model.  A 
fixed dose of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (base d on a median body weight 
of approximately 75 kg).  A total  of 1000 patients were simulat ed using a body weight 
distribution of 40 to 120 kg.  Simulation results demonstrated that body weight-based and 
fixed dosing regimens yield similar median steady state PK conc entrations with slightly less 
overall between-patient variability with the fixed dosing regim en. 
Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab  using data from Phase I 
through Phase III studies (N=654; doses=0.01 to 15 mg/kg q4w or  every 90 days; metastatic 
melanoma; Wang et al 2014).  A population PK  model indicated mi nor impact of body weight 
on the PK of tremelimumab (coefficient of ≤0.5).  The body weig ht-based (1 mg/kg q4w) and 
fixed dosing (75 mg/kg q4w; based on a median body weight of ap proximately 75 kg) 
regimens of tremelimumab were compared using predicted PK conce ntrations (5th, median, 
and 95th percentiles) using a population PK model in a simulated popula tion of 1000 patients 
with a body weight distribution of 40 to 120 kg.  Similar to ME DI4736, simulations indicated 
that both body weight-based and fixed dosing regimens of tremel imumab yield similar median 
steady state PK concentrations with slightly less overall betwe en-patient variability with the 
fixed dosing regimen. 
Similar findings have been reported by others (Narwal et al 201 3, Ng et al 2006, Wang et al 
2009, Zhang et al 2012).  Wang and colleagues investigated 12 m Abs and found that fixed 
dosing and body size-based dosing regimens perform similarly, w ith fixed dosing regimen 
being better for 7 of 12 antibodies (Wang et al 2009).  In addi tion, they investigated 18 
therapeutic proteins and peptides and showed that fixed dosing regimen performed better for 
12 of 18 therapeutic proteins and peptides in terms of reducing  the between-patient variability 
in PK/pharmacodynamics parameters (Zhang et al 2012). 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by the prescribing communi ty due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors.  Given the expectation of similar PK exp osure and variability, 
AstraZeneca considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing re gimens.  Based on an average 
body weight of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1.5 g q4w MEDI4736 (equiv alent to 20 mg/kg q4w) and 
75 mg q4w tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg q4w) as well as 7 50 mg tremelimumab 
(equivalent to 10 mg/kg) is included in the current study. 
1.2.3 Rationale for retreatment options 
In contrast to patients treated with chemotherapy, who are unli kely to respond to rechallenge 
with the same agent upon progression, responses have been obser ved upon retreatment with 
IMTs.  Several potential mechanisms of resistance to IMT exist,  including loss of T-cell 
“memory” or recurrence of immune escape, which suggest that ret reatment for patients who 
initially respond or demonstrate SD is reasonable.  Preliminary  data in patients previously 
treated with IMTs suggest that responses are similar to those o bserved following initial 
treatment (Forde et al 2015; Hodi et al 2010).  Therefore, pati ents receiving tremelimumab 
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 13 Sep 2018 
39 (178) monotherapy, MEDI4736 monotherapy, or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab c ombination therapy 
who achieve and maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) th rough the end of the 12-
month treatment period may restart treatment with their assigne d treatment upon evidence of 
progressive disease (PD) during follow-up.  In addition, patien ts receiving combination 
therapy who complete the 4 dosing cycles with the combination o f MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab (with clinical benefit per Investigator judgment),  but subsequently experience 
progression (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors, Version 1.1 
[RECIST 1.1]) during treatment with MEDI4736 alone, will be giv en the option to restart 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combinati on therapy.  All patients who restart treatment will 
receive a maximum of 12 months of further treatment.  For detai ls on the retreatment criteria 
for this study, see Section 7.2.2. 
1.2.4 Rationale for sequencing to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy after confirmed disease progre ssion 
The rationale for providing an option to sequence to MEDI4736 m onotherapy or MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy after confirmed disease progre ssion during treatment with 
tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up is supported by bo th non-clinical and clinical 
data.  Non-clinical evidence shows that anti-CTLA-4-based thera py upregulates PD-L1 
expression (Wolchok et al 2013).  Additionally, recent data hav e demonstrated that 
combination blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 leads to distinct biolo gical changes that are not 
observed with blockade of each checkpoint alone (Das et al 2015 ).  Clinical data demonstrate 
efficacy with anti-PD-1-based therapy after progression on anti -CTLA-4 (ipilimumab; Robert 
et al 2014, Wolchok et al 2013).  Also, sequential therapy with  anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 
agents has shown promising activity in patients with melanoma, with 70% of patients alive at 
1 year and 31% of patients with a >80% reduction in tumor burde n with sequential therapy at 
36 weeks (Sznol et al 2014).  For details on the sequencing cri teria for this study, see Section 
7.2.3. 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment 
The following sections include summaries of the potential benef its and risks associated with 
tremelimumab monotherapy, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy prior to the overall benefit-risk assessmen t. 
1.3.1 Potential benefits 
1.3.1.1  Tremelimumab 
In a single-arm, Phase II study (Study A3671008) of tremelimuma b administered at 15 mg/kg 
every 90 days to patients with refractory melanoma, a response rate of 7% and a median OS of 
10 months in the second-line setting (as compared to approximat ely 6 months with best 
supportive care reported from a retrospective analysis; Korn et  al 2008) were observed 
(Kirkwood et al 2010).  In a randomized, open-label, first-line  Phase III study of 
tremelimumab (administered at 15 mg/kg every 90 days) versus ch emotherapy (dacarbazine or 
temozolomide) in advanced melanoma (Study A3671009), results of  the final analysis showed 
a response rate of 11% and a median OS of 12.58 months in this first-line setting as compared

40 (178) to 10.71 months with standard chemotherapy; however, these resu lts were not statistically 
significant (Ribas et al 2013).  Additionally, in a Phase II ma intenance study (Study 
A3671015) in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC who have resp onded or remained stable, 
PFS at 3 months was 22.7% in the tremelimumab arm (15 mg/kg) co mpared with 11.9% in the 
best supportive care arm (Study A3671015). 
1.3.1.2  MEDI4736 
Of the 414 patients treated with MEDI4736 (all dose levels) in all tumor types in Study 1108 
as of 14 July 2014, a total of 169 patients were evaluable for response analysis, which 
included patients who had at least 24 weeks of follow-up as of 14 July 2014 and had either at 
least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment or experienced clinical PD or death.  Nineteen patients 
(11.2%) had a best overall response of confirmed and unconfirme d CR/PR.  The DCR (CR + 
PR + SD ≥12 weeks) was 32% (54 of 169 patients).  PD -L1 status (based on 
Ventana/MedImmune assay) was known for 143 of 169 evaluable pat ients, of whom 30 had 
PD-L1-positive tumors (defined by tumor staining >25%).  A best  overall response of CR/PR 
(confirmed and unconfirmed) was observed in 7 of 30 patients (2 3.3%) with PD-L1-positive 
tumors and in 6 of 113 patients (5.3%) with PD-L1-negative tumo rs. 
1.3.1.3  MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
The non-clinical and clinical justification for this combinatio n as noted in Section 1.2.2.3 also 
supports the synergy of this combination.  Available data, such  as those presented by Wolchok 
et al, suggest that the combination of agents targeting PD-1/PD -L1 and CTLA-4 may have 
profound and durable benefits in patients with melanoma (Wolcho k et al 2013).  Furthermore, 
preliminary efficacy data from Study D4190C00006 have demonstra ted that this combination 
is clinically active and well tolerated.  As of  15 April 2015, 63 patients were evaluable for 
response across various MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination the rapy dose regimens.  In 
the MEDI4736 20-mg/kg plus tremelimumab 1-mg/kg q4w dose cohort , a total of 8 of 18 
patients were evaluable for efficacy with at least 16 weeks of follow-up. 
1.3.2 Potential risks 
Monoclonal antibodies directed against immune checkpoint protei ns, such as programmed cell 
death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as well as those directed against progra mmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), aim to boost endogen ous immune responses 
directed against tumor cells. By stimulating the immune system however, there is the potential 
for adverse effects on other tissues. 
Most adverse drug reactions seen with the immune checkpoint inhibitor class of agents are 
thought to be due to the effects of inflammatory cells on speci fic tissues. These risks are 
generally events with a potential inflammatory or immune mediat ed mechanism and which 
may require more frequent monitoring and/or unique intervention s such as 
immunosuppressants and/or endocrine therapy. These immune media ted effects, can occur in 
nearly any organ system, and are most commonly seen as gastroin testinal AEs such as colitis 
and diarrhoea, pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD), hep atic AEs such as hepatitis and

including hypo- and hyper-thyroidism. 
1.3.2.1  Tremelimumab 
Risks with tremelimumab monotherapy include, but are not limite d to, GI effects (colitis, 
diarrhoea, enterocolitis and intestinal perforation), endocrine  disorders (hypo and 
hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis and adrenal insufficiency), skin effects (rash, and pruritus), 
elevations in lipase and amylase and clinical manifestations of  pancreatitis, other 
gastrointestinal events e.g. ulcerative colitis, dehydration, n ausea and vomiting; hepatic events 
including hepatitis, and liver enzyme elevations; pneumonitis a nd ILD; nervous system events 
including encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory neuropathi es, Guillain-Barre and 
proximal muscle weakness; cytopenias including thrombocytopenia , anemia and neutropenia; 
infusion-related reactions, anaphylaxis, and allergic reactions ; renal events including renal 
failure, acute kidney injury, nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, au toimmune nephritis and 
electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia; autoimmune disea ses including autoimmune 
arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and giant cell temporal arteritis ; hyperglycemia and diabetes

1.3.2.2  MEDI4736 
Risks with durvalumab include, but are not limited to, diarrhea /colitis and intestinal 
perforation, pneumonitis/ILD, endocrinopathies (hypo- and hyper -thyroidism, type I diabetes 
mellitus, hypophysitis and adrenal insufficiency) hepatitis/inc reases in transaminases, 
nephritis/increases in creatinine, pancreatitis/increases in am ylase and lipase,

inflammatory events including neurotoxicities, infusion-related  reactions, hypersensitivity 
reactions and infections/serious infections.  
For information on all identified and potential risks with durv alumab please always refer to 
the current version of the durvalumab IB. 
In monotherapy clinical studies AEs (all grades) reported very commonly (≥ 10% of patients) 
are fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, dyspnea, cough, consti pation, diarrhea, vomiting, back 
pain, pyrexia, asthenia, anemia, arthralgia, peripheral edema, headache, rash, and pruritus. 
Approximately 9% of patients experienced an AE that resulted in  permanent discontinuation 
of durvalumab and approximately 6% of patients experienced an S AE that was considered to 
be related to durvalumab by the study investigator. 
The majority of treatment-related AEs were manageable with dose  delays, symptomatic 
treatment, and in the case of events suspected to have an immun e basis, the use of established 
treatment guidelines for immune-mediated toxicity (please see A ppendix E ).

of the durvalumab IB. 
1.3.2.3  MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
The safety of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy was  initially evaluated in the 
ongoing dose escalation and dose expansion Study 006, in patien ts with NSCLC, and is being 
studied in a number of other ongoing clinical trials, in a numb er of different indications, and 
has to date shown a manageable safety and tolerability profile.    
The types of risks with the combination of durvalumab + tremeli mumab (based on an 
equivalent durvalumab dose of 20m/kg and a tremelimumab dose of  1mg/kg) are similar to 
those for durvalumab and tremelimumab monotherapy. Emerging dat a from study 006, other 
studies evaluating the combination, and from combinations of ot her agents in the same class 
indicate an increased frequency and/or severity of some of thes e immune-mediated toxicities.

combination please always refer to the current version of the d urvalumab IB 
In durvalumab+tremelimumab combination studies at the dose of d urvalumab 20mg/kg and

Approximately 15% of patients experienced an AE that resulted i n permanent discontinuation 
of study drug and approximately 15% of patients experienced an SAE that was considered to 
be related to durvalumab and tremelimumab by the study investig ator. 
A detailed summary of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination AE data can be found in the 
current version of the durvalumab IB. 
1.3.3 Overall benefit and risk assessment 
There remains a significant unmet medical need for additional t reatment options for patients 
with advanced solid tumors.  Responses to currently available c hemotherapies and targeted 
therapies offer little in terms of durable response, and many h ave significant toxicities that 
affect a patient’s perceived quality of life (QoL).  Treatment with agents targeting CTLA -4 or 
PD-1/PD-L1 has shown activity in several tumor types, with a su bset of patients deriving 
meaningful and durable benefit.  Across the clinical developmen t program for tremelimumab, 
a pattern of efficacy has emerged that is similar to that of th e related anti-CTLA-4 antibody, 
ipilimumab.  The efficacy of tremelimumab appears to be consist ent across tumor types.  
Thus, tremelimumab may potentially offer benefit to this patien t population.  The study design 
aims to minimize potential risks, and intensive monitoring, inc luding early safety assessment, 
is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely based on p rior experience with IPs. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Version 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
43 (178) The toxicity profile of tremelimumab includes diarrhea, rash, p ruritus, fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, decreased appetite, headache, pyrexia, abdominal pain , and colitis.  The toxicity 
profile of MEDI4736 includes fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreas ed appetite, rash, vomiting, 
pruritus, dyspnea, pyrexia, hypothyroidism, increased ALT, incr eased AST, cough, myalgia, 
abdominal pain, and dizziness. 
Based upon the available non-clinical and clinical safety data,  the limited survival benefit 
provided by the currently available treatment options to patien ts, the limited life expectancy 
due to malignant disease, the activity seen with tremelimumab a cross tumor types, and the 
strength of the scientific hypotheses under evaluation, the tre melimumab monotherapy with 
potential sequencing, after confirmed progression during treatm ent or follow-up, to 
MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination the rapy proposed for 
evaluation in this study may have the ability to provide meanin gful clinical benefit with a 
manageable safety and tolerability profile by generating durabl e clinical responses, thereby 
improving QoL and potentially extending survival.  The overall benefit: risk assessment is 
appropriate per the proposed study design. 
1.4 Study Design 
This is an open-label, multi-center study to determine the effi cacy and safety of tremelimumab 
monotherapy (750 mg via intravenous [IV] infusion q4w for 7 dos es [cycles], then q12w for 2 
additional doses [cycles] for up to a total of 12 months [9 dos es (cycles) total]) in the 
treatment of different patient cohorts with specified advanced solid tumors.  (Additional tumor 
types may be added at the discretion of the Sponsor.)  If eligi ble and at the discretion of the 
Investigator, after confirmed disease progression on tremelimum ab monotherapy or during 
follow-up, patients will also have the option of being sequence d to MEDI4736 monotherapy 
(1.5 g via IV infusion q4w for up to a total of 12 months [13 d oses (cycles)]) or MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy (MEDI4736 1.5 g via IV infusio n q4w in combination 
with tremelimumab 75 mg via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 cycles each, followed by 
MEDI4736 1.5 g via IV infusion q4w for up to a total of 8 month s [9 additional doses 
(cycles)]), for up to 12 months or until disease progression, w hichever comes sooner. 
Schematic diagrams of the overall study design are shown in Fig ure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3, 
and a flowchart of the study is presented in Figure 4. 
This study will screen approximately 38 patients with each sele cted advanced solid tumor type 
in order to enroll approximately 32 evaluable patients with eac h tumor type globally. 
For each tumor cohort, a minimax Simon 2-Stage design will be u sed to stop recruitment early

3.3 Patient enrolment and randomization 
Investigators should keep a record, the subject screening log, of subjects who entered pre-
study screening. 
At Screening (Days -28 to -1), the Investigators or suitably tr ained delegate will: 
1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential patient befor e any study specific 
procedures are performed. 
2. Assign the potential patient a unique 7-digit enrollment number , beginning with 
"E#."  This is obtained through the Interactive Voice Response System 
(IVRS)/Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) (ECCNNXXX: CC bei ng the 
country code, NN being the center number, and XXX being the pat ient enrollment 
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 13 Sep 2018 
57 (178) code at the center).  Enrollment numbers will start at 001 in e ach center and go up 
sequentially (eg, at Center 01, patients will be assigned enrol lment numbers 
E0101001, E0101002, etc). This number is the patient's unique i dentifier and is 
used to identify the patient on the electronic case report form s (eCRFs). 
3. Obtain tumor sample and send for PD-L1 expression.  Patients mu st be able to 
undergo a newly acquired tumor biopsy during screening (strongl y encouraged) or 
to provide an available tumor sample prior to screening. The fr esh or archived 
sample must be received by the central laboratory prior to dosi ng.  Tumor lesions 
used for newly acquired biopsies should not be target lesions, unless there are no 
other lesions suitable for biopsy.  Samples with limited tumor content and fine 
needle aspirate specimens are not acceptable .  Specimens from metastatic bone 
lesions are typically unacceptable unless there is a significan t soft tissue component.  
The tumor specimen should be of sufficient quantity to allow fo r PD-L1 IHC and 
other exploratory biomarker analyses and is preferred in formal in-fixed paraffin 
embedded blocks.  Fresh samples, if necessary, should be obtain ed as the last step 
in the screening process, after the patient has been confirmed to meet all other 
inclusion criteria and confirmed not to meet any exclusion crit eria. 
4. Determine patient eligibility (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2) 
If the patient is ineligible and not enrolled, the IVRS/IWRS sh ould be contacted to terminate 
the patient in the system. 
Patients will begin treatment on Day 1.  Patients must not be t reated unless all eligibility 
criteria have been met. If same-day treatment is not possible, then the study treatment should 
begin within 3 working days of registration. 
Following confirmed PD on tremelimumab monotherapy or during fo llow-up, patients who 
meet all criteria have the option to sequence to MEDI4736 monot herapy or MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy, at the discretion of the Inve stigator.  See Section 3.5 and 
7.2.3 for details. 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then hi s or her enrollment code or 
patient identification number cannot be reused. 
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized pati ent 
Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, be 
enrolled or receive study medication.  There can be no exceptio ns to this rule.  Patients who 
are enrolled, but subsequently found not to meet all the eligib ility criteria must not be enrolled 
or initiated on treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study . 
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is enrolled in error, and incorrectly 
started on treatment, the investigator should inform the AstraZ eneca study physician 
immediately, and a discussion should occur between the AstraZen eca study physician and the

58 (178) investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the p atient from treatment.  The 
AstraZeneca study physician must ensure all decisions are appro priately documented. 
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups 
This is a single-arm study in which all patients who experience  confirmed PD on 
tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up will have the opti on to sequence to either 
MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination the rapy, if the patient 
meets the required criteria (see Section 7.2.3).  The choice of  sequencing to either MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy is a t the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding (Not Applicable) 
This is not a blinded study. 
3.7 Methods for unblinding (Not Applicable) 
This is not a blinded study. 
3.8 Restrictions 
The following restrictions apply while the patient is receiving  study treatment and for the 
specified times before and after: 
1. Female patient of child bearing potential 
Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually acti ve with a non-
sterilized male partner must use at least 1 highly effective me thod of contraception 
from screening and must agree to continue using such precaution s 90 days after the 
last dose of tremelimumab monotherapy or MEDI4736 monotherapy o r 180 days 
after the last dose of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination ther apy; cessation of 
birth control after this point should be discussed with a respo nsible physician.  
Female patients must use a hormonal method in addition to a bar rier method (ie, 
male condom plus spermicide) to ensure pregnancy does not occur .  Not engaging 
in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, periodic  abstinence, the 
rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable met hods of birth 
control.  Female patients should refrain from breastfeeding and  egg cell donation 
throughout this period. 
It is strongly recommended for the male partner of a female pat ient to also use a 
male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. 
 Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically 
sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete 
hysterectomy) or post-menopausal (defined as 12 months with no menstruation 
without an alternative medical cause).

59 (178)  Effective methods (including highly effective methods) of contr aception are 
described in Table 1.  A highly effective method of contr aception is defined as 
1 that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year ) when used 
consistently and correctly.  Note that not all methods in Table  1 are considered 
highly effective.   
2. Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential. 
Non-sterilized male patients who are sexually active with a fem ale partner of 
childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide f rom Day 1 and for 
90 days after the last dose of tremelimumab monotherapy or MEDI 4736 
monotherapy or 180 days after the final dose of MEDI4736 + trem elimumab 
combination therapy.  Not engaging in sexual activity is an acc eptable practice; 
however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the with drawal method are 
not acceptable methods of contraception .  Male patients should refrain from sperm 
donation throughout this same period. 
It is strongly recommended for the female partner of a male pat ient to also use an 
effective method of contraception throughout this period (Table  1). 
All patients: Patients should not donate blood while participating in this st udy and for 3 
months following the last dose of study treatment.

3.9 Discontinuation of inve stigational product 
An individual patient will not receive any further IP (tremelim umab monotherapy, MEDI4736 
monotherapy, or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy) if  any of the following 
occur:

Study Code D4884C00001 Version 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
60 (178) x Withdrawal of consent from further treatment with IP.  (The pat ient is at any time 
free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further tre atment.  A patient who 
discontinues treatment may choose to continue to participate in  the study [ie, a 
patient may discontinue treatment but not discontinue the study , such that the 
patient no longer receives treatment with IP but still particip ates in other study-
related procedures, as necessary].) 
x An AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor, contraindicates 
further dosing 
x Any AE that meets criteria for discontinuation 
x Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant 
x Non-compliance with the study protocol that, in the opinion of the Investigator or 
Sponsor, warrants withdrawal from study treatment (eg, refusal to adhere to 
scheduled visits) 
x Lost to follow-up 
x Initiation of alternative anticancer therapy including another investigational agent 
other than the specified subsequent study treatments included i n this study 
x Confirmed PD and Investigator determination that the patient is  no longer 
benefiting from treatment with IP 
Patients who develop brain metastases while on study may contin ue on tremelimumab 
monotherapy, be sequenced to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 +  tremelimumab 
combination therapy, and continue on MEDI4736 monotherapy or ME DI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy provided that the patients are  asymptomatic from the 
brain metastases, have not required the use of steroids (>10 mg  of prednisone equivalents) or 
anticonvulsants within 14 days of retreatment, and have shown n o progression in the brain for 
at least 28 days after treatment. 
3.9.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investigationa l product 
At any time, subjects are free to discontinue investigational p roduct without prejudice to 
further treatment.  A subject that decides to discontinue the I P will always be asked about the 
reason(s) for discontinuation and the presence of any adverse e vents.  If possible, they will be 
seen and assessed by an Investigator.  Adverse events will be f ollowed up (See Section 6.3.2). 
All study drugs should be returned by the subject.  The Study P hysician should be notified of 
any ongoing AE that may delay treatment or necessitate permanen t discontinuation of 
treatment. Prior to discontinuing a patient from study therapy,  it is strongly recommended that 
the patient’s case be discussed with AstraZeneca in consultatio n with the treating physician.

Study Code D4884C00001 Version 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
61 (178) Patients who are permanently discontinued from further receipt of IP, regardless of the reason, 
will be identified as having permanently discontinued treatment .  Patients who are 
permanently discontinued will enter long-term follow-up (see Ta ble 3).  All patients will be 
followed for survival until the end of the study.  Subjects who  decline to return to the site for 
evaluations should be contacted by telephone every 2 months as an alternative unless consent 
is withdrawn. 
3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 
3.10.1  Screen failures 
Screening failures are patients who do not fulfill the eligibil ity criteria for the study, and 
therefore must not be enrolled.  These patients should have the  reason for study withdrawal 
recorded as ‘eligibility criteria not fulfilled’ (i.e., patient  does not meet the required 
inclusion/exclusion criteria).  This reason for study withdrawa l is only valid for screen failures 
(not enrolled patients). 
3.10.2  Withdrawal of the informed consent 
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP an d assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment. 
Patients who withdraw consent for further participation in the study will not receive any 
further IP or further study observation, with the exception of follow-up for survival, which 
will continue until the end of the study unless the patient has  expressly withdrawn their 
consent to survival follow-up.  Note that the patient may be of fered additional tests or tapering 
of treatment to withdraw safely. 
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) for withdrawal and 
the presence of any AE.  The Investigator will follow up AEs ou tside of the clinical study. 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then hi s/her enrolment code cannot be 
reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
Patients will be considered lost to follow-up only if no contac t has been established by the 
time the study is completed (see Section 9.3), such that there is insufficient information to 
determine the patient’s status at that time.  Patients who refu se continuing participation in the 
study, including t elephone contact, should be documented as “withdrawal of consen t” rather 
than “lost to follow -up.”  Investigators should document attempts to re -establish contact with 
missing patients throughout the study period.  If contact with a missing patient is re-
established, the patient should not be considered lost to follo w-up and any evaluations should 
resume according to the protocol. 
3.11 Discontinuation of the study 
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of the Sponsor, tr ial (study) patients are placed 
at undue risk because of clinically significant findings that: 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Version 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
62 (178) x Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered s ignificant 
x Are assessed as causally related to study drug 
x Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the st udy 
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available fo r the patient at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRFs. All  reasons for discontinuation 
of treatment must be documented. 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate  consideration is given to the 
protection of the subjects’ interests.  If this study is discontinued, all other studies involving 
tremelimumab or MEDI4736 will remain open to enro llment and screening, if deemed 
appropriate by the Sponsor.

66 (178) b Body weight recorded at all physical examinations.  Height is o nly measured at Screening. 
c Blood pressure and pulse will be evaluated prior to the beginn ing of the infusion, at 30 minutes (±5 minutes) during treatmen t, at the end of infusion (60 minutes ±5 
minutes), and in the 1-hour post-infusion observation period (6 0 minutes [±5 minutes] after the infusion) (ie, 120 minutes [±5  minutes] from the start of the infusion) for 
the first infusion only and then for subsequent infusions as cl inically indicated.  These assessments should be followed for e ach of the component infusions.  Body 
temperature and respiratory rate will be evaluated pre-dose (pr ior to each infusion). 
d ECG will be performed at Screening and as clinically indicated . For clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTc F value >470 ms, 2 additional 12-lead  
         ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 mi nutes) to confirm prolongation. 
e Local palliative radiotherapy for pain management is acceptable ; however, if a target lesion is irradiated, that information m ust be captured. 
f If screening laboratory assessments are performed within 3 days  prior to Day 1, then tests do not need to be repeated at Day 1 .  Hematology, serum chemistry, and liver 
enzymes results must be available and reviewed before each dose  of therapy.  At any time per the Inves tigator’s clinical judgment, more frequent serum chemistry or L FT 
monitoring is allowed as clinically indicated.  Coagulation tes ts include activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin t ime, and international normalized ratio. 
Gamma glutamyltransferase tested at Screening, Day 1, and as cl inically indicated. 
g f T 3 and fT 4 will only be measured if TSH is abnormal or if there is clinic al suspicion of an AE related to the endocrine system. 
h For women of childbearing potential only.  A urine or serum pr egnancy test is acceptable. 
i On Week 0 (Day 1), Week 12, and Week 24, PK samples will be co llected pre-dose (within 6 hours prior to treatment with any IP , i.e prior to the 1st investigational 
product's infusion on the scheduled day), within 10 minutes aft er tremelimumab infusion completion (for tremelimumab monothera py or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy only), and at the end of MEDI4736 infusion (for MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combinatio n therapy only).  PK samples 
will be collected similarly for patients receiving tremelimumab  monotherapy and for patients who receive subsequent study trea tment with MEDI4736 monotherapy or 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy. A follow up PK sam ple collection for tremelimumab is required for MEDI4736+tremel imumab combination therapy 
at week 24. 
j At Week 4, PK samples will be collected pre-dose (within 6 hou rs prior to treatment with any IP) only.  PK samples will be co llected similarly for patients receiving 
tremelimumab monotherapy and for patients who receive subsequen t study treatment with MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + treme limumab combination therapy. 
k All patients will be enrolled into tremelimumab monotherapy, s tudy treatment should begin within 3 days of registration.  Aft er confirmed disease progression with 
tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up, patients may be s equenced to treatment with MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + t remelimumab combination 
therapy for up to 12 months or until disease progression, which ever comes sooner (see Section 7.2.3 for details).  In cases of unequivocal PD/symptomatic PD, the 
Investigator may elect not to confirm PD depending on the statu s of the patient before sequencing.  For the combination therapy only - tremelimumab will be 
administered first; the MEDI4736 infusion will start approximat ely 1 hour after the end of the tremelimumab infusion.  If no c linically significant infusion reactions are 
observed during or after the first cycle, subsequent infusion o bservation periods can be conducted at the Investigator’s disc retion (suggested 30 minutes after each 
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab infusion). 
l Samples collected pre-infusion at the scheduled visits. 
m The fresh or archived sample must be received by the central la boratory prior to dosing.  Fresh samples, if necessary, should be obtained as the last step in the screening 
process, after the patient has been confirmed to meet all other  inclusion criteria and confirmed not to meet any exclusion cri teria.  The collection of tumor biopsies at the 
time of confirmed PD on tremelimumab or during follow-up prior to dosing with MEDI4736-based regimen and at discontinuation of  study treatment is strongly 
encouraged, when clinically feasible. 
n RECIST 1.1 assessments will be performed on CT (preferred) or MRI scans, either preferred with IV contrast, of the chest, the  abdomen (including liver and adrenal 
glands), and the pelvis, as necessary based on tumor type.  Add itional anatomy may be imaged based on signs and symptoms of in dividual patients.  Baseline 
assessments, ideally, should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment.  The confirmatory scans should  preferably be performed at the next 
scheduled visit (relative to the date of the first infusion of IP) and no less than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR /PR and PD (in the absence of clinically 
significant deterioration).  If an unscheduled assessment was p erformed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt shou ld be made to perform the subsequent 
assessments at his or her scheduled visits (relative to the dat e of the first infusion of IP).  All confirmatory scans should be recorded on the database. 
Note : For “retreatment” patients who go on to have a subsequent 12 months of treatment, the same assessments should be done as in  the first 12-month treatment period with 
the exception of the PK, ADA, and MDSCs assessments, which do n ot need to be collected a second time. 
Note : Assessments to be performed at the times stipulated in the ta ble and as clinically required in the management of the patient .

71 (178) 4.1 Enrolment/screening period 
All screening and enrollment procedures will be performed accor ding to the assessment 
schedule in Table 2.  Demographic data and other characteristic s will be recorded including 
date of birth or age, gender, smoking history, and race/ethnici ty, according to local 
regulations.  A standard medical and surgical history will be o btained as well as information 
on previous treatments for the tumor type. 
Written informed consent and any locally required privacy act d ocument authorization must 
be obtained prior to performing any protocol-specific procedure s, including screening/baseline 
evaluations.  All patients w ill be required to provide consent to supply a sample of their tumor 
(archival or fresh biopsy) for entry into this study.  This con sent is included in the main 
patient informed consent form (ICF). 
All screening procedures must be performed within 28 days befor e the first dose of 
tremelimumab monotherapy (Days -28 to -1), unless otherwise spe cified.  Screening 
evaluations may be performed over more than 1 visit.  The fresh  or archived tumor sample 
must be received by the central laboratory prior to dosing.  Fr esh samples, if necessary, should 
be obtained as the last step in the screening process, after th e patient has been confirmed to 
meet all other inclusion criteria and confirmed not to meet any  exclusion criteria.  
4.2 Treatment period 
All procedures to be conducted during the 12-month treatment pe riod will be performed 
according to the assessment schedule (see Table 2).  A cycle of  treatment is scheduled to last 4 
weeks (28 days). 
Whenever vital signs, ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for t he same nominal time, the 
assessments should occur in the following order: ECG, vital sig ns, and then blood draws.  The 
timing of the first 2 assessments should be such that it allows  the blood draw (eg, PK blood 
sample) to occur at the exact nominal time. 
4.3 Follow-up period 
All procedures to be conducted during the 12-month follow-up pe riod will be performed 
according to the assessment schedule (see Table 3).  Patients w ho have confirmed PD while 
on tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up and subsequentl y receive MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy will  follow Table 2 while 
on therapy. 
Whenever vital signs, ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for t he same nominal time, the

The Rave Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and 
query handling.  The investigator will ensure that data are rec orded on the eCRFs as specified 
in the study protocol and in accordance with the instructions p rovided. 
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeli ness of the data recorded and 
of the provision of answers to data queries according to the cl inical study agreement (CSA). 
The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed eCRFs will be 
archived at the study site. 
5.1 Efficacy assessments 
RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to assess patient response to treatment by determining ORR, 
DoR, DCR, and PFS.  The RECIST 1.1 guidelines for measurable, n on-measurable, target, 
and nontarget lesions and the objective tumor response criteria  (CR, PR, SD, or PD) are 
presented in Appendix D.  OS will also be evaluated. 
The methods of imaging tumor burden used at baseline are CT (pr eferred) or MRI scans, 
preferably with IV contrast, of the chest, the abdomen (includi ng liver and adrenal glands), 
and the pelvis, as necessary based on tumor type.  Any other ar eas of disease involvement 
should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms o f individual patients. All on-
study assessments should utilize the same mode of scanning (CT or MRI) as baseline scans for 
accurate comparisons. 
The baseline assessment should be performed no more than 28 day s before the start of 
tremelimumab monotherapy and, ideally, as close as possible to the start of treatment.  For 
patients who sequence to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tre melimumab 
combination therapy following confirmed PD on tremelimumab mono therapy or during 
follow-up, a new baseline assessment should be performed no mor e than 28 days before the 
start of either MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab  combination therapy 
and, ideally, as close as possible to the start of the sequence d treatment.  If the scan 
confirming PD on tremelimumab monotherapy occurs within 28 days  of the first dose of 
sequencing therapy, this scan may be used as the baseline scan for sequencing to MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremel imumab combination therapy.  Se e Section 7.2.3 for 
details on sequencing criteria.  Efficacy for all patients will  be assessed by objective tumor 
assessments as follows according to their tumor type .  Additional tumor types may be added at 
the discretion of the Sponsor. 
UBC and TNBC: Every 8 weeks (q8w; ±1 week) relative to the date  of first infusion of IP (see 
Table 2 and Table 3) until confirmed progression 
PDAC: Every 6 weeks (q6w; ±1 week) for the first 48 weeks relat ive to the date of first 
infusion of IP (see Table 2 and Table 3) and then q12w (±1 week ) thereafter until confirmed 
progression

73 (178) Confirmed objective disease progression is defined by RECIST 1. 1 (irrespective of the reason 
for stopping treatment/or subsequent therapy).  If an unschedul ed assessment is performed and 
the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to  perform the subsequent 
assessments at his or her scheduled visits (relative to the dat e of first infusion of IP). 
For patients who discontinue treatment due to toxicity in the a bsence of confirmed objective 
progression, objective tumor assessments should be continued as  described above until 
confirmed objective disease progression. 
In addition to the required confirmatory scan for  PR and CR, a confirmatory scan is also 
required following the initial demonstration of PD.  In cases o f unequivocal PD/symptomatic 
PD, the Investigator may elect not to confirm PD depending on t he status of the patient.  The 
confirmatory scan should occur preferably at the next scheduled  visit and no earlier than 4 
weeks after the initial assessment of PD in the absence of clin ically significant deterioration.  
Treatment with tremelimumab monotherapy may continue between th e initial assessment of 
progression and confirmation for progression. Progression would  be considered confirmed per 
RECIST 1.1 criteria available in Appendix D. Sequencing to MEDI 4736 monotherapy or 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy after confirmation of progression on 
tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow- up is at the Investigator’s  discretion.  Treatment 
with sequenced therapy will begin not less than 42 days and not  more than 120 days after the 
last dose of tremelimumab monotherapy.  For patients who have c onfirmed PD during the 
tremelimumab monotherapy follow-up period, treatment with seque nced therapy will not be 
more than 60 days after confirmed progression. 
If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subseque nt anticancer therapy) prior to 
progression, then the patient should still continue to be follo wed until confirmed objective 
disease progression. 
Categorization of objective tumor response assessment will be b ased on the RECIST 1.1 
criteria of response: CR, PR, SD, and PD.  Target lesion progre ssion will be calculated in 
comparison to when the tumor burden was at a minimum (ie, small est sum of diameters 
previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, tumor response (CR or PR) and 
SD will be calculated in comparison to the baseline tumor measu rements obtained before 
starting treatment. 
Objective tumor response (CR or PR) should be confirmed prefera bly at the next scheduled 
visit and not less than 4 weeks after the visit when the respon se was first observed. 
Following confirmed disease progression, patients should contin ue to be followed up for 
survival every 2 months (8 weeks) as outlined in the study plan  (Table 3).  An exception is 
patients with confirmed PD who continue to receive IP at the di scretion of the Investigator 
(after consultation with AstraZeneca) or who sequence to MEDI47 36 monotherapy or 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combinati on therapy.  Patients who cont inue on therapy after 
confirmed PD can receive treatment for a maximum of 12 months.  In addition, patients who 
have PD or discontinue from treatment should be followed every 6 months for subsequent 
therapy.

74 (178) Patients who achieve and maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to the end of 
the 12-month tremelimumab monotherapy treatment period, or the 12-month MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy trea tment period (after 
sequencing), will enter follow-up .  Any of these patients who then develop PD (with or 
without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1) during the follow -up period may restart their 
treatment for another 12 months with the same treatment guideli nes followed previously.  In 
addition, patients receiving combination therapy who complete t he 4 dosing cycles with 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab (with clin ical benefit per Investigator’s judgment), but 
subsequently experience progression (according to RECIST 1.1) d uring treatment with 
MEDI4736 alone, will be given the option to restart MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination 
therapy.  See Section 7.2.2 for eligibility criteria for restar ting treatment.  Tumor assessment 
scans should occur as described above and in Table 2 (relative to the date of first infusion of 
IP, ±1 week) until confirmed disease progression. 
It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as  possible.  Refer to the study 
plans (Table 2 [screening and the treatment period], Table 3 [f or follow-up period]), and 
Appendix D. 
5.1.1 Central reading of scans 
Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) assessments are not p lanned for this study.  
However, all images will be collected centrally so that the sca ns will be available if such 
verification becomes necessary.  The decision to perform a BICR  is at the discretion of the 
Sponsor.  If performed, BICR will include RECIST 1.1, RECIST 1. 1 modified for 
confirmation of progression, and irRECIST 1.1.  Guidelines for imaging collection and 
storage will be provided in a separate document.  The managemen t of patients will be based 
solely upon the results of assessment conducted by the Investig ator.
5.2 Safety assessments 
5.2.1 Laboratory safety assessments 
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry , haematology, coagulation, 
thyroid function and urinalysis will be taken at the times indi cated in Table 2 and Table 3. 
Clinical laboratory safety tests, including serum or urine preg nancy tests for women of 
childbearing potential, will be performed in a qualified local clinical laboratory according to 
local standard procedures.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may v ary depending on the 
laboratory method used and routine practice at the site.  Urine  pregnancy tests may be 
performed at the site using a licensed test (dipstick).  Abnorm al clinically significant 
laboratory results should be repeated as soon as possible (pref erably within 24 to 48 hours). 
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indica ted at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  The date and results will be recorded on the app ropriate eCRF. 
The following laboratory variables to be measured are presented  in Table 4 (clinical 
chemistry), Table 5 (hematology), and Table 6 (urinalysis).

If a patient shows an AST or ALT ≥3×ULN together with total bil irubin ≥2×ULN, refer to  
Appendix C for further instructions.  These cases should be rep orted as SAEs if, after 
evaluation, they meet the criteria for a Hy’s Law case or if an y of the individual liver test 
parameters fulfill any of the SAE criteria.  All patients with an elevated AST, ALT, or 
bilirubin value (the latter at ≥1.5×ULN) at the time of the las t dose of study treatment should 
have a further liver chemistry profile (AST, ALT, bilirubin, an d alkaline phosphatase) 
performed 30 days (±3 days) after permanent discontinuation of study treatment. 
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values should be  repeated as clinically 
indicated and recorded on the eCRF.  Situations in which labora tory safety results should be 
reported as AEs are described in Section 6.3.7. 
All patients with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory values at the time of  completion or discontinuation 
from study treatment must have further tests performed until th e laboratory values have 
returned to Grade 1 or 2, or until all serious or study drug-re lated toxicities have resolved or 
are determined to be “chronic” or “stable,” whichever is later.  
5.2.2 Physical examination 
Physical examinations will be performed according to the assess ment schedules (see Table 2

Resting 12-lead ECGs will be recorded according to the assessme nt schedule (see Table 2). 
ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supine position for 5 minutes and 
should be recorded while the patient remains in that position. 
ECG will be recorded at Screening and as clinically indicated. 
In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >470 ms, 2 
additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm 
prolongation. 
ECG measurements will include heart rate, PR interval, QT inter val, RR interval, and QRS 
complex. 
Situations in which ECG results should be reported as AEs are d escribed in Section 6.3.7. 
5.2.4 Vital signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse, temperature, and respi ration rate) will be evaluated 
according to the assessment schedules (see Table 2 and Table 3) . 
On infusion days, patients will be monitored during and after i nfusion of IP as presented in the 
bulleted list below. 
Supine or semi-supine BP will be measured using a BP recording device with an appropriate 
cuff size, after the patient has rested for at least 5 minutes.   BP and pulse will be collected 
from patients before, during, and after the infusion at the fol lowing times (based on a 60-
minute infusion): 
x Prior to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from appr oximately 30 
minutes before up to 0 minutes, that is, the beginning of the i nfusion) 
x At 30 minutes during the infusion (halfway through infusion) (± 5 minutes) 
x At the end of the infusion (approximately 60 minutes ±5 minutes ) 
x A 1-hour post-infusion observation period (60 minutes [±5 minut es] after the 
infusion, ie, 120 minutes [±5 minutes] from the start of the in fusion) is required 
after the first infusion of tremelimumab or MEDI4736.  For the combination 
therapy group, these assessments should be followed for each of  the 2 component 
infusions.  If no clinically significant infusion reactions are  observed during or after 
the first cycle, subsequent infusion observation periods can be  at the Investigator’s 
discretion (suggested approximately 30 minutes after the infusi on). 
If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then BP and pulse  measurements should follow 
the principles as described above or be taken more frequently i f clinically indicated.  The date 
and time of collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  Additional

Body temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius at the vis its indicated in Table 2 and 
Table 3.  The assessment will be prior to each infusion on the dosing days. 
5.2.5 Other safety assessments 
Pregnancy tests on either urine (human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG]) or blood (serum beta-
hCG) samples will be performed for pre-menopausal women of chil dbearing potential at the 
times specified in the assessment schedule (see Table 2 and Tab le 3).  Tests will be performed 
by the hospital’s local laboratory.  If results are positive, t he patient is ineligible and must be 
discontinued from treatment.  In the event of a suspected pregn ancy during the study, the test 
should be repeated. 
Other safety tests to be performed at Screening include assessm ent for hepatitis B surface 
antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, HIV antibodies, thyroid stimul ating hormone, free 
triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine.

5.4 Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity 
5.4.1 Collection of samples and determination of drug concentration 
Blood samples for determination of tremelimumab and MEDI4736 co ncentration in serum 
will be obtained according to the assessment schedules (see Tab le 2 and Table 3). 
Samples for determination of tremelimumab and MEDI4736 concentr ation in serum will be 
analyzed by a designated third party on behalf of AstraZeneca.  Samples will be collected, 
labeled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manu al.  Full details of the 
analytical method used will be described in a separate Bioanaly tical Validation Report. 
5.4.2 Collection of samples to measure for the presence of anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA) 
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate ADA responses to ME DI4736 and ADA 
responses to tremelimumab (see Table 2 and Table 3 for the sche dule of tests). 
Evaluations will be performed using a validated immunoassay.  T iered analyses will be 
performed to include screening, confirmatory, and titer assay c omponents, and the positive-
negative cut points will be statistically determined from drug- naïve validation samples. 
Samples may be utilized for further characterization of the ADA  response, including possible 
assessment of neutralizing antibody. 
5.4.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic/anti-drug antibodies  samples 
PK and ADA samples, if not exhausted by analyses outlined herei n, may be retained for 15 
years from the last patient last visit date for research purpos es. 
PK and ADA samples may be disposed of or destroyed or anonymize d by pooling.  Additional 
analyses may be conducted on the anonymized, pooled PK samples to further evaluate and 
validate the analytical method.  Results from such analyses may  be reported separately from 
the Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be perfo rmed alongside the bioanalysis 
of the test samples.  The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the CSR but 
separately in a Bioanalytical Validation Report. 
Any residual material collected for PK-based analyses may be us ed for future exploratory 
biomarker research (in this case, samples will be shipped to th e Biobank as designated by 
AstraZenenca; see details in the Laboratory Manual). 
5.5 Biomarker analysis 
The patient’s consent to the use of donated biological samples is mandatory.

80 (178) Pretreatment tumor PD-L1 expression will be evaluated in all pa tients.  Whenever tissue 
biopsy is feasible, tumor PD-L1 expression will also be assesse d following progression on 
tremelimumab or on MEDI4736-based regimens.  Putative associati ons with clinical 
endpoints will be assessed.  Tumor requirements are briefly des cribed in Section 5.5.1. 
Based on availability of tissue, additional exploratory biomark ers may be evaluated as 
described in Section 5.5.1.1.  Also, descriptions of explorator y, peripheral measures are 
described in this section.  Samples will be obtained according to the assessment schedules 
provided in Table 2 and Table 3.  Details for collection, volum es, storage, and shipment of 
biologic samples are presented in a separate Laboratory Manual.  
Exploratory measures using the plasma samples obtained at pretr eatment and following 
tremelimumab monotherapy may be completed in an effort to under stand immunomodulatory 
effects. 
Biomarker results may be pooled with biomarker data from other tremelimumab and 
MEDI4736 studies to evaluate biological responses across indica tions and to compare results 
in monotherapy versus combination settings. 
All samples collected for biomarker analyses will be stored at the study site, a reference 
laboratory, or at facilities designated by AstraZeneca and may be used for subsequent research 
relevant to evaluating biological and/or clinical response to i mmunotherapy. 
5.5.1 Evaluation of candidate, predictive markers - Tumor PD-L1 
Provision of tissue for PD-L1 IHC is as follows: 
x MANDATORY: Provision of a tumor biopsy formalin fixed and embed ded in 
paraffin.  A freshly collected tumor biopsy is preferred; howev er, an archival 
sample is acceptable.  This sample must be received by the cent ral laboratory prior 
to dosing.  Fresh samples, if necessary, should be obtained as the last step in the 
screening process, after the patient has been confirmed to meet  all other inclusion 
criteria and confirmed not to meet any exclusion criteria. 
Samples should be collected via a core needle (18 gauge or larg er) or be collected 
as an excisional or incisional tumor biopsy sample. 
When tissue is newly obtained for the purpose of entry into the  study, 2 cores 
should be placed in formalin and processed to a single paraffin  embedded block, as 
described in the Laboratory Manual. 
The tumor specimen submitted (as described in the inclusion cri teria in Section 3.1) 
should be of sufficient quantity to allow for PD-L1 IHC analyse s (see the 
Laboratory Manual).  Newly acquired or archival specimens with limited tumor 
content and fine needle aspirates are inadequate for defining t umor PD-L1 status. 
Specimens from metastatic bone lesions are typically unacceptab le unless there is a 
significant soft tissue component. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
81 (178) Tumor lesions used for fresh biopsies should not be the same le sions used as 
RECIST 1.1 target lesions, unless there are no other lesions su itable for biopsy.  If a 
RECIST 1.1 targ et lesion is used for biopsy, the lesion must be ≥2 cm in the l ongest 
diameter and must be biopsied outside of the screening period. 
x The collection of tumor biopsies at the time of confirmed PD on  tremelimumab or 
during follow-up prior to dosing with the MEDI4736-based regime ns is strongly 
encouraged.  Data obtained from such specimens will aid in esta blishing 
tremelimumab-induced biological changes in the tumor microenvir onment.  The 
biopsy procedure should be omitted if there is unacceptable cli nical risk or if the 
procedure is otherwise considered not feasible.  The Investigat or must consult with the 
Study Physician if such sampling is not feasible.  All specimen s may be assessed for 
PD-L1 as well as the exploratory markers described below.  
x The collection of tumor biopsies at study treatment discontinua tion, including at 
disease progression on MEDI4736-based regimens.  The collection of additional 
biopsies upon discontinuation of study treatment is strongly en couraged to enable 
discovery efforts (ie, identification of factors rendering tumo rs nonresponsive to 
immunotherapy).  
An additional biopsy is not required for patients restarting tr emelimumab monotherapy, 
MEDI4736 monotherapy, or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination th erapy following 
completion of 12 months of treatment. 
Additional tumor biopsies collected as part of clinical care (e g, for mixed responses or upon 
PD) may be submitted for exploratory analyses.  Tumor tissue bl ock is preferred.  If a tissue 
block is unavailable, unstained sections from the tissue block may be submitted.  Please 
consult the Laboratory Manual for specific instructions and gui delines regarding sections. 
Please review the Laboratory Manual for further details of requ irements including sample 
quality control and shipping. 
A brief description of exploratory tumor markers likely to be e xplored by IHC or ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) analysis is provided in Section 5.5.1.1. 
The Ventana PD-L1 IHC assay will be used to determine PD-L1 IHC  status in this study.  The 
Ventana PD-L1 IHC analysis will be performed at a Ventana appro ved College of American 
Pathologists/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act laboratory. 
To meet the requirement of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a pproval of a companion 
diagnostic, sections of the tumor will be retained at Ventana f or potential additional studies, as 
requested by the FDA, to support the test approval.

82 (178) 5.5.1.1  Exploratory biomarkers - tumor and blood-based 
Blood and tumor samples for exploratory biomarker analyses will  be obtained according to the 
schedule presented in Table 2 and Table 3.  Details for collect ion, volumes, storage, and 
shipment of biologic samples are presented in a separate Labora tory Manual. 
Pharmacodynamic changes in biomarker measures will be monitored , when applicable.  
Baseline measures and early, on-treatment changes will be corre lated with outcomes to 
identify candidate prognostic/predictive markers.  Data will be  reviewed in aggregate and in 
individual indications. 
The exploratory biomarker plan is described by sample type belo w. 
Tumor markers (in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) 
Tissue obtained as part of screening procedures (or at progress ion) and for establishing PD-L1 
status will be analyzed for additional markers by IHC.  At a mi nimum, a goal is to complete 
CD8 and CD4/FoxP3 measures in an effort to enumerate cytotoxic versus regulatory T cells.  
Based on availability of tissue, a panel of additional, immune- relevant markers expressed on 
TILs or on tumor cells may be assessed.  Markers of special int erest include, but are not 
limited to, OX40, GITR, PD-L2, Tim-3, CD137, and Lag-3. 
Tissues obtained may also be assessed also for somatic mutation s and/or for an interferon-
gamma (IFN- γ) gene expression signature (eg, IFN- γ, CXCL9, or CXCL10) by reverse 
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR),  in situ hybridization, 
NanoString®, and/or similar methodologies. 
Whole blood gene expression (PaxGene-RNA) 
Whole blood samples will be obtained before or after treatment as outlined in Table 2 and 
Table 3 from all patients.  Total RNA will be prepared for quan tification of RNA and/or 
micro-RNA (miRNA) expression using RT-qPCR, microarray, sequenc ing, NanoString, or 
similar methodology. 
Focus is likely to be given to the expression of immunomodulato ry genes previously found to 
be up-regulated in response to tremelimumab and/or MEDI4736 (da ta not shown).  
Pretreatment expression of such genes may indicate active immun e responses that may be 
augmented by checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies; correlations  with outcome data will be 
completed on select candidate, predictive markers with the aim of characterizing useful 
expression thresholds for identifying patients likely to receiv e benefit.  Similar procedures 
may be completed using select peripheral blood mononuclear cell  (PBMC) samples described 
below. 
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
Recent collective findings suggest that a baseline measure of c irculating myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs) may be used as a prognostic tool in di fferent disease settings and 
may specifically predict the likelihood of response to ipilimum ab (anti-CTLA-4 therapy)

83 (178) (Kitano et al 2014, Meyer et al 2014).  Flow cytometry will be completed on all patients to 
quantify circulating MDSC subtypes in specimens obtained at pre treatment and in specimens 
obtained prior to dosing with MEDI4736-based reg imens.  Differe nt MDSC count thresholds 
will be analyzed for their ability to predict clinical benefit from tremelimumab 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
Whole blood samples will be collected for preparation of PBMCs and storage for potential 
downstream analyses.  A variety of assays may be pursued, inclu ding immune cell 
composition/activation status analyses by flow cytometry, epige netic analyses of DNA, 
MDSC assessments in banked specimens, T-cell functional assays (eg, ELISPOT), tetramer 
analyses to monitor antigen-specific T cells, RNA/miRNA express ion, and/or the assessment 
of the diversity and clonality of T-cell receptor gene rearrang ements using DNA. 
Circulating soluble factors - plasma 
Plasma will be obtained before or after treatment as outlined i n Table 2 and Table 3.  The 
concentrations of a panel of cytokines and chemokines will be a ssessed.  Focus is likely to be 
given to factors involved in Th1-driven immune responses, inclu ding IFN- γ, IL -18, CXCL9, 
and CXCL10.  High pretreatment expressions (concentrations) of such factors may indicate 
active immune responses that may be augmented by checkpoint inh ibitor immunotherapies; 
correlations with outcome data will be completed on select cand idate predictive markers, with 
an aim of characterizing useful expression thresholds for ident ifying patients likely to receive 
benefit or, alternatively, for identifying patients likely to s uffer drug-related AEs. 
Similarly, the concentrations of a battery of immune cell ligan ds or receptors may be assessed.  
Proteins of special interest include CTLA4, PD-1, PDL1, B7-1, B 7-2, and IL6R. 
Plasma may also be used for the detection/quantification of aut oantibodies (against tumor-
associated antigens) on ProtoArray® or a similar assay platform containing antigens 
preselected based on documented expression in study indications .  Seroconversion following 
treatment will be used as an indicator of overcoming tolerance.   Pretreatment seropositivity 
against specific antigens may provide predictive value, particu larly when combined with data 
regarding the presence of antigen-specific T cells (Yuan et al 2011).  The refore, select, 
candidate autoantibody measures may be evaluated for associatio ns with clinical benefit and 
for directing PBMC-based antigen-directed measures as described  for PBMCs above. 
5.5.2 Management of biomarker data 
The biomarker data will have unknown clinical significance.  As traZeneca will not provide 
biomarker research results to patients, their family members, a ny insurance company, an 
employer, clinical study investigator, general physician, or an y other third party, unless 
required to do so by law.  The patient’s samples will not be us ed for any purpose other than 
those described in the study protocol. 
Individual patients will not be identified in any report or pub lication resulting from this work.  
The data and results of this research may be reviewed with coll aborators and published, but

84 (178) neither the patient’s name nor any other personal identifiers w ill appear in any publication or 
report. 
5.5.3 Storage, re-use, and destruction of biological samples 
Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the date of the Last Patient’s Last 
Visit, after which they will be destroyed.  The results of this  biomarker research may be 
reported in the CSR itself, as an addendum, or separately in a scientific report or publication.  
The results of this biomarker research may be pooled with bioma rker data from other studies 
involving tremelimumab or MEDI4736 to generate hypotheses to be  tested in future research. 
5.5.4 Labeling and shipment of biological samples 
The Principal Investigator will ensure that samples are labeled  and shipped in accordance with 
the Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B,  Regulations (materials 
containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that d o not meet Category A criteria); 
see Appendix B. 
Any samples identified as Infectious Category A materials will not be shipped, and no further 
samples will be taken from the involved patients unless agreed upon with AstraZeneca and 
appropriate labeling, shipment, and containment provisions are approved. 
5.5.5 Chain of custody of biological samples 
A full chain of custody will be maintained for all samples thro ughout their life cycle. 
The Principal Investigator at each center w ill keep full traceability of collected biological 
samples from the patients while in storage at the center until shipment or disposal (where 
appropriate) and will keep documentation of receipt of arrival where possible. 
The sample receiver will keep full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use 
until used or disposed of or until further shipment and will ke ep documentation of receipt of 
arrival. 
AstraZeneca will keep oversight of the entire life cycle throug h internal procedures, 
monitoring of study sites, and auditing of external laboratory providers. 
Samples retained for further use will be registered in the Astr aZeneca Biobank system during 
the entire life cycle. 
5.5.6 Withdrawal of informed consent for donated biological samples 
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated biological  samples, the samples will be 
disposed of or destroyed and the action will be documented.  If  samples have already been 
analyzed, AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results obt ained from those samples. 
The Principal Investigator will:

informed consent to the use of donated samples. 
x Ensure that biological samples from that patient, if stored at the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of or destroyed and the action  documented. 
x Ensure that the laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are imme diately informed 
about the withdrawn consent and that samples are disposed of or  destroyed, the 
action is documented, and the signed document is returned to th e study site. 
x Ensure that the patient and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.

Not applicable. 
6. SAFETY REPORTING AND  MEDICAL MANAGEMENT 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all  staff involved in the study are 
familiar with the content of this section. 
6.1 Definition of adverse events 
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or  the deterioration of a pre-
existing medical condition (other than progression of the malig nancy under evaluation) 
following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, wheth er or not considered causally 
related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition can b e symptoms (eg, nausea or 
chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia or enlarged liver) or the a bnormal results of an investigation 
(eg, laboratory findings or ECG).  In clinical studies, an AE c an include an undesirable 
medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or wa shout periods, even if no study 
treatment has been administered. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs . 
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event 
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, t reatment, washout, or follow-
up), that fulfills one or more of the following criteria: 
x Results in death 
x Is immediately life-threatening 
x Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing  hospitalization 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions

Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
86 (178) x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
x Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient o r may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed abov e 
For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Appendix A. 
6.3 Recording of adverse events 
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events 
AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time the informed conse nt is signed through 90 days 
after the last dose of the last study treatment or through init iation of subsequent anticancer 
therapy. 
6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events 
During the course of the study, all AEs and SAEs should be proa ctively followed 
up for each patient.  Every effort should be made to obtain a r esolution for all 
events, even if the events continue after discontinuation or st udy completion. 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study are followed up 
by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated but with out further 
recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to reques t additional 
information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the en d of the study, if 
judged necessary. 
6.3.3 Variables 
The following variables will be collect for each AE: 
x AE (verbatim) 
x The date when the AE started and stopped 
x Changes in CTCAE grade 
x Whether the AE is serious or not 
x Investigator causality rating against the IPs (yes or no) 
x Action taken with regard to IPs 
x Administration of treatment for the AE 
x Whether the AE caused the patient’s withdrawal from the study ( yes or no)  
x Outcome

Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
87 (178) In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs : 
x Date the AE met criteria for SAE 
x Date the Investigator became aware of the SAE 
x Seriousness criteria fulfilled 
x Date of hospitalization 
x Date of discharge 
x Probable cause of death 
x Date of death 
x Whether an autopsy was performed 
x Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s) 
x Description of the AE 
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03 , will be utilized for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events withou t assigned CTCAE grades, 
the recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, mo derate, and severe events 
into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy of the CTCAE, Version  4.03, can be downloaded 
from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http://ctep .cancer.gov). 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Sec tion 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For exam ple, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE un less it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results  in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE w hen it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. 
6.3.4 Causality collection 
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between the IP  and each AE and answer “yes” 
or “no” to the question, “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by the investigational product?”  
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other m edication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study proc edure the causal relationship is 
implied as “yes.”  
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is foun d in Appendix A.

Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
88 (178) 6.3.5 Relationship to protocol procedures 
The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of t he relationship of SAEs to 
protocol procedures on the SAE report form.  This includes both  non-treatment –emergent (ie, 
SAEs that occur prior to the administration of IP) and treatmen t-emergent SAEs.  A protocol-
related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or interventio n required during the study (eg, 
blood collection).  The following guidelines should be used by Investigators to assess the 
relationship of SAEs to the protocol: 
x Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure or inte rvention that was 
described in the protocol for which there is no alternative eti ology present in the 
patient’s medical record.  
x Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other  than the procedure or 
intervention that was described in the protocol.  The alternati ve etiology must be 
documented in the study patient’s medical record.  
6.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in re sponse to the open question 
from the study personnel: “Have you had any health problems sin ce the previous visit/you 
were last asked?” or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (w hen possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known a nd there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diag nosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately. 
6.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests 
The results from protocol-mandated laboratory tests and vital s igns will be summarized in the 
CSR.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandate d laboratory values and vital 
signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfill DQ\RIWKH6$(FULWHULDRU
DUHWKHUHDVRQIRUGLVFRQWLQXDWLRQRIWUHDWPHQWZLWKWKH,3
If deterioration in a laboratory value or vital sign is associa ted with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the  associated laboratory result 
or vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wh erever possible, the reporting 
Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term  (eg, anemia versus low 
hemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptom s, clinically relevant 
deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as  AE(s). 
Deterioration of a laboratory value that is unequivocally due t o disease progression should not 
be reported as an AE/SAE. 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical find ing at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an  AE.

89 (178) 6.3.8 Hy’s Law  
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry ma y require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3×ULN together with total bilirub in ≥2×ULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix C for further in struction on cases of increases 
in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.  
6.3.9 Disease progression 
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patie nt’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the IP is being studied.  It may be an in crease in the severity of the 
disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the dis ease.  The development of new 
or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer und er study should be considered 
as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivo cally due to disease 
progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 
6.3.10  New cancers 
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE.  New primary cancers are 
those that are not the primary reason for the administration of  the study treatment and have 
been identified after the patient’s inclusion in this study.  
6.3.11  Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol- defined follow-up period after 
the administration of the last dose of study treatment, must be  reported as follows: 
x Death clearly resulting from disease progression should be repo rted to the Study 
Physician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented  in the eCRF.  It 
should not be reported as an SAE. 
x Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of t he disease under 
study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the Study P hysician as an SAE 
within 24 hours.  The report should contain a comment regarding  the 
co-involvement of PD, if appropriate, and should assign main an d contributory 
causes of death. 
x Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SA E.  A post-
mortem may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed, a 
copy of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to AstraZen eca Drug Safety or 
its representative within the usual timeframes. 
6.3.12  Safety Data To Be Collected following the final DCO of the stud y 
For patients continuing to receive investigational product afte r final DCO and database 
closure, it is recommended that the patients continue the sched uled site visits and Investigators 
monitor the patient’s safety laboratory results prior to and pe riodically during treatment 
inorder to manage AEs in accordance with the Dose Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines (see Section 6.8.1 and Appendix E). All data post th e final DCO and database 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
90 (178) closure will be recorded in the patient notes but, with the exc eption of SAEs, will not 
otherwise be reported for the purposes of this study.  
 
All SAEs that occur in patients still receiving investigational  product (or within the 90 days 
following the last dose of  the  last study treatment) post the  final DCO and database closure 
must be reported as detailed in Section  6.4,  using the paper form process.  
  
6.4 Reporting of seriou s adverse events 
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causall y related to the IP, or to the 
study procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. 
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigator s or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, i mmediately but no later than 
24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Sa fety data entry site within 1 
calendar day  of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar 
days  of initial receipt for all other SAEs. 
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant i nformation is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other si te personnel inform 
AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a p reviously reported SAE 
within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes 
aware of it. 
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE i s serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. 
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or o ther study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. 
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator or study site personnel how to 
proceed. 
The reference documents for the definition of expectedness or l istedness are the IBs for 
tremelimumab and MEDI4736. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that pro cedures and expertise are 
available to handle medical emergencies during the study.  A medical emergency usually 
constitutes an SAE and is to be reported as such.

91 (178) 6.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientifi c and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Investigational Product and may require cl ose monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may b e serious or non-serious. 
The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of the se events in order to 
characterize and understand them in association with the use of  this investigational product. 
AESIs for durvalumab ± tremelimumab include but are not limited  to events with a potential 
inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism and which may require  more frequent 
monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppres sants and/or hormone 
replacement therapy. These AESIs are being closely monitored in  clinical studies with 
durvalumab monotherapy and combination therapy. An immune-media ted adverse event 
(imAE) is defined as an AESI that is associated with drug expos ure and is consistent with an 
immune-mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear  alternate aetiology. 
Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as approp riate, should be used to 
support an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made t o rule out neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the imAE.  
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an event be ing an imAE, the Investigator 
should promptly contact the Study Physician. 
AESIs observed with durvalumab ± tremelimumab include: 
x Diarrhea / Colitis and intestinal perforation 
x Pneumonitis / ILD 
x hepatitis / transaminase increases 
x Endocrinopathies (i.e. events of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal 
insufficiency, hyper- and hypothyroidism and type I diabetes me llitus) 
x Rash / Dermatitis 
x Nephritis / Blood creatinine increases 
x Pancreatitis  / serum lipase and amylase increases   
x Myocarditis 
x Myositis / Polymyositis 
x Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (e.g. Guillain-Barré, and m yasthenia gravis) 
x Other inflammatory responses that are rare / less frequent with  a potential immune-
mediated aetiology include, but are not limited to, pericarditi s, sarcoidosis, uveitis

92 (178) and other events involving the eye, skin, haematological and rh eumatological 
events. 
In addition, infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity/an aphylactic reactions with a 
different underlying pharmacological aetiology are also conside red AESIs. 
Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) c an be found in the current 
version of the durvalumab and tremelimumab Investigator’s Broch ures. More specific 
guidelines for their evaluation and treatment are described in detail in the Dosing Modification 
and Toxicity Management Guidelines (please see Section 6.8.1). These guidelines have been 
prepared by the Sponsor to assist the Investigator in the exerc ise of his/her clinical judgment 
in treating these types of toxicities.  These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related 
to the study drug/study regimen by the reporting investigator. 
6.6 Overdose 
Use of IP in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol is considered to be an overdose.  
There is currently no specific treatment in the event of overdo se of IP, and possible symptoms 
of overdose are not established.  
x An overdose with associated AEs will be recorded as the AE diag nosis or 
symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Over dose eCRF 
module. 
x An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the  Overdose eCRF 
module. 
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the cours e of the study, then the 
Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZe neca representatives 
immediately, or no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the  Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Saf ety data entry site. 
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting ti melines apply, see Section 6.4.  
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days. 
6.7 Pregnancy 
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to  AstraZeneca. 
6.7.1 Maternal exposure 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, t he IP should be discontinued 
immediately. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a sus picion that the IP under study 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive m edication.  Congenital

93 (178) abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should  be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be h andled as AEs.  The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective terminati on, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and doc umented even if the patient 
was discontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the In vestigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 da y, that is, immediately but no 
later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the In vestigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Saf ety data entry site within 1 or 5 
calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for  all other pregnancies. 
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.  
The PREGREP module in the eCRF is used to report the pregnancy and the PREGOUT is 
used to report the outcome of the pregnancy. 
6.7.2 Paternal exposure 
Male patients must refrain from fathering a child or donating s perm during the study and for 
90 days after the last dose of tremelimumab monotherapy or MEDI 4736 monotherapy or 180 
days after the final dose of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combinatio n therapy. 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an A E.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ect opic pregnancy, normal birth, 
or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first  dose should, if possible, be 
followed up and documented. 
Where a report of pregnancy is received, prior to obtaining inf ormation about the pregnancy, 
the Investigator must obtain the c onsent of the patient’s partner.  
6.8 Management of investigational product-related toxicities 
The following general guidance should be followed for managemen t of toxicities. 
x Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (incl uding holding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicity if required). 
x If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consider ation should be 
given to continuing the same dose of the assigned IP along with  appropriate 
continuing supportive care.  If medically appropriate, dose mod ifications are 
permitted  
x All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasonin g and 
documentation of the approach taken.

and MEDI4736+ tremelimumab 
Guidelines for the management of immune-mediated reactions, inf usion-related reactions, and 
non-immune-mediated reactions for MEDI4736 monotherapy and MEDI 4736 + 
tremelimumab are provided in the Dosing Modification and Toxici ty Management Guidelines, 
Please see section Appendix E. The most current version of the TMGs is also available 
through the following link: https://tmg.azirae.com.  In additio n a version of the current TMGs

Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts  should be made to rule out 
neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic ca uses of the imAE. Serologic, 
immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, shou ld be used to support an imAE 
diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, even ts should be considered 
potentially immune related. 
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which MEDI4736 and tremelimumab should be 
permanently discontinued (see section 3.9 of this protocol and the Dosing Modification and 
Toxicity Management Guidelines). 
Following the first dose of IP, subsequent administration of ME DI4736 and tremelimumab 
can be modified based on toxicities observed as described in th e Dosing Modification and 
Toxicity Management Guidelines.  These guidelines have been pre pared by the Sponsor to 
assist the Investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical jud gment in treating these types of 
toxicities.  These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to durvalumab 
monotherapy and the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab regimen by the repo rting investigator. 
Dose reductions are not permitted.   In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with 
the Study Physician. 
6.9 Study governance and oversight 
The safety of all AstraZeneca clinical studies is closely monit ored on an ongoing basis by 
AstraZeneca representatives in consultation with Patient Safety .  Issues identified will be 
addressed; for instance, this could involve amendments to the s tudy protocol and letters to 
Investigators.

99 (178) therapy group is met, as described below.  Patients meeting the  retreatment criteria below, for 
their respective treatment, will follow the same treatment guid elines followed during the 
initial 12-month treatment period, including the same dose and frequency of treatments and 
the same schedule of assessments, with the exception of PK, ADA  and MDSCs assessments, 
which do not need to be collected a second time.  Also, an addi tional biopsy is not required for 
patients restarting treatment following completion of 12 months  of treatment but is strongly 
encouraged prior to sequencing to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4 736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy (see Section 5.5.1). 
Patients who meet the criteria for retreatment for their respec tive treatment may only receive 
retreatment once.  Crossover from  the MEDI 4736 monotherapy grou p to the MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy group will not be permitted. 
Patients receiving treatment with tremelimumab monotherapy or M EDI4736 monotherapy 
may undergo retreatment in 1 clinical scenario, described below : 
1. Patients who achieve or maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, o r SD) through to the 
end of the 12-month treatment period may restart their assigned  treatment 
(tremelimumab monotherapy or MEDI4736 monotherapy) upon evidenc e of PD, 
with or without confirmation and according to RECIST 1.1, durin g follow-up. 
Patients receiving treatment with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combi nation therapy may 
undergo retreatment in 2 clinical scenarios, described below: 
2. Patients who achieve and maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to 
the end of the 12-month treatment period may start retreatment with the 
combination upon evidence of PD, with or without confirmation a nd according to 
RECIST 1.1, during follow-up. 
3. Patients who complete the 4 dosing cycles of the combination of  MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab portion of the regimen (with clinical benefit per Investigator 
judgment), but subsequently have evidence of PD during the MEDI 4736 
monotherapy portion of the combination regimen, with or without  confirmation 
according to RECIST 1.1, may start retreatment with the combina tion. 
For all treatment groups, before a patient starts retreatment h is or her assigned treatment, the 
Investigator should ensure that the patient: 
1. Does not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible to xicities that indicate 
continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient 
2. Still meets all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion crit eria for this study 
3. Has not received an intervening systemic anticancer therapy aft er their assigned 
treatment discontinuation

further scans should occur with the same frequency as during th e initial 12 months 
of treatment (relative to the date of restarting treatment) unt il study treatment is 
stopped (maximum of 12 months of further treatment). 
During the retreatment period, patients in the tremelimumab mon otherapy treatment group 
will resume tremelimumab dosing at 750 mg via IV infusion q4w f or 7 doses (cycles), then 
q12w for another 2 doses (cycles). 
Patients in the MEDI4736 monotherapy treatment group will resum e MEDI4736 dosing at 1.5 
g via IV infusion q4w for up to a total of 12 months (up to 13 doses [cycles]). 
Patients in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy gro up will resume 
MEDI4736 dosing at 1.5 g via IV infusion q4w with 75 mg via IV infusion of tremelimumab 
q4w for 4 cycles each.  Patients will then continue with MEDI47 36 monotherapy at 1.5 g via 
IV infusion q4w, beginning at Week 16, 4 weeks after the last d ose of combination therapy, 
up to a total of 9 additional doses (cycles) with the final dos e at Week 48. 
Patients who have confirmed PD during the 12-month initial trea tment period with 
tremelimumab monotherapy, in the 12-month retreatment period, o r during follow-up will 
have the option to initiate therapy with MEDI4736 monotherapy o r MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy (see Section 7.2.3).  In cases  of unequivocal 
PD/symptomatic PD, the Investigator may elect not to confirm PD  depending on the status of 
the patient before sequencing. Patients who have discontinued t reatment due to toxicity or 
symptomatic deterioration, or who have commenced subsequent ant icancer therapy, will be 
followed up until confirmed disease progression or death (which ever occurs first). 
Treatment through progression and retreatment are at the Investigator’s discretion, and the 
Investigator should ensure that patients do not have any signif icant, unacceptable, or 
irreversible toxicities that indicate that continuing treatment  will not further benefit the 
patient.  The Investigator should ensure that patients still me et all of the inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria for this study and that these pa tients meet the following specific 
criteria for treatment in the setting of PD: 
x Written informed consent to continue treatment in the setting o f PD. This consent 
document will specify that treatment beyond PD is not the stand ard-of-care and that 
alternative treatment options, either locally licensed treatmen ts or other clinical 
trials, are available for this patient population. 
x Absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically sig nificant disease 
progression and no decline in ECOG performance status to >1 
x Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical 
sites (eg, central nervous system metastasis, respiratory failu re due to tumor 
compression, or spinal cord compression) requiring urgent alter native medical 
intervention

monotherapy cannot continue therapy or obtain retreatment if do sing is ongoing and the 
progression occurs in the target lesions that have previously s hown a confirmed response (CR 
or PR).  A patient with a confirmed progression receiving MEDI4 736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy cannot continue therapy or obtain retreatme nt if dosing is ongoing in the 
combination portion of therapy (q4w dosing) and progression occ urs in thetarget lesions that 
have previously shown a confirmed response (CR or PR). 
7.2.3 Sequencing to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy 
Patients who have confirmed disease progression (with confirmat ion according to RECIST 
1.1) at any time during tremelimumab monotherapy treatment, and  who meet the necessary 
criteria, may be sequenced to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy, at the discretion of the Investigator, upo n termination of tremelimumab 
monotherapy treatment.  Treatment with sequenced therapy in the se patients will begin not 
less than 42 days and not more than 120 days after the last dos e of tremelimumab 
monotherapy and will continue for up to 12 months or until dise ase progression (whichever 
comes sooner).  Patients who have confirmed PD during the treme limumab monotherapy 
follow-up period, and who meet the necessary criteria, may also  be sequenced, in cases of 
unequivocal PD/symptomatic PD, the Investigator may elect not t o confirm PD depending on 
the status of the patient before sequencing.  Treatment with se quenced therapy in these 
patients will begin not more than 60 days after confirmed progr ession and will continue for up 
to 12 months or until disease progression (whichever comes soon er).  Patients who sequence 
to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and meet the 
criteria listed in Section 7.2.2 are eligible for retreatment o nce, upon progression (with or 
without confirmation), with their assigned MEDI4736-based regim en. 
Patients who experience confirmed PD on tremelimumab monotherap y or during follow-up 
will be eligible to sequence to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI473 6 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy if they meet the following criteria: 
1. No initiation of an alternative anticancer therapy 
2. No use of steroids (>10 mg prednisone equivalents) within 14 da ys of first dose of 
MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination the rapy 
3. Continue to meet inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusi on criteria for the 
study with the exception of providing another tumor biopsy Has had a baseline 
tumor assessment within 28 days of starting their sequenced tre atment; all further 
scans should occur with the same frequency as during the initia l 12 months of 
treatment with tremelimumab monotherapy (relative to the date o f first infusion of 
IP) until study treatment is stopped.  If the scan confirming P D on tremelimumab 
monotherapy occurs within 28 days of the first dose of sequenci ng therapy, this 
scan may be used as the baseline scan for sequencing to MEDI473 6 monotherapy or 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy.

103 (178) Post final Data Cut off (DCO) 
Efficacy scans will be collected in accordance with local clini cal practice. Patients who are 
still in progression-free follow up following the final DCO and  database closure are to 
undergo sampling for local laboratory assessments in such a way  that continued per-protocol 
eligibility for retreatment or sequencing with IP can be proper ly determined (Figure 4). For 
patients receiving retreatment or sequencing with IP following the final DCO and database 
closure, it is recommended that the patients continue the sched uled site visits and Investigators 
monitor the patients’ safety laboratory results prior to and pe riodically during treatment with 
IP in order to manage AEs in accordance with the Dosing Modific ation and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines (Section 6.8.1 and Appendix E). 
In the event that a roll-over or safety extension study is avai lable at the time of the final DCO 
and database closure, patients currently receiving treatment wi th IP may be transitioned to 
such a study, and the current study would reach its end. The ro ll-over or safety extension 
study would ensure treatment continuation with visit assessment s per its protocol. Any patient 
who would be proposed to move to such a study would be given a new Informed Consent. 
Study drug may be supplied to sites manually outside of IXRS sy stem. Drug accountability 
should be managed as described in Section 7.6. 
7.3 Labelling 
Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing P ractice (GMP) and local 
regulatory guidelines.  The labels will fulfill GMP Annex 13 re quirements for labeling.  Label 
text will be translated into the local language. 
Labels will be provided as either a single panel label or as mu lti-language booklet labels. 
7.4 Storage 
All study drugs should be kept in a secure place under appropri ate storage conditions.  IPs are

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA 
8.1 Statistical considerations 
All statistical analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or it s representatives.  The analyses 
will be descriptive and no inferential analysis will be perform ed based on statistical tests.  All 
evaluations will be exploratory in nature. 
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepare d prior to database lock, and 
any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendm ents completed prior to 
reporting of the data.

Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
106 (178) 8.2 Sample size estimate 
This study will screen approximately 38 patients with each sele cted advanced solid tumor type 
globally to enroll approximately 32 evaluable patients (ie, pat ients eligible to be included in 
the Full Analysis Set [FAS]).  (Additional tumor types may be a dded at the discretion of the 
Sponsor.) 
The study is sized to allow the use of a minimax Simon 2-Stage design (Simon 1989) within 
each of the tumor types according to the following assumptions and algorithms.  The minimax 
Simon 2-Stage design as well as DCR after 2 tumor assessments w ill be evaluated to reduce 
exposure of a large number of patients to ineffective treatment , according to the algorithm 
below: 
x H0: p0=0.02 (p0: proportion of responders under the null hypoth esis) 
x H1: p1=0.14 (p1: proportion of responders under the alternate h ypothesis) 
Algorithm: 
N=32 evaluable patients, with N 1=20 and N 2=12 
x If no response is observed out of the first 20 patients, the DC R data will also be 
evaluated to make a final decision before discontinuing the tum or cohort.  (Ongoing 
patients will still be eligible to sequence to MEDI4736 monothe rapy or MEDI4736 
+ tremelimumab combination therapy as previously described.)  I f ≥10 out of the 
first 20 pa tients achieve DCR (≥50% DCR) after 2 tumor assessments, then a n 
additional 12 patients may be enrolled.  A final decision to co ntinue enrollment will 
be made by the Sponsor after evaluating all of the available cl inical data at that 
time. 
x If 1 or more responses are observed out of the first 20 patient s, enroll 12 additional 
patients, for a total of 32 evaluable patients for each tumor t ype. 
 If ≤2 responses are observed out of the 32 patients, then no fu rther 
investigation of that tumor type will be done. 
 If >2 responses are observed out of the 32 patients, the null h ypothesis will be 
rejected, and further investigation of that tumor type is warra nted. 
The assessment of response after the first 20 evaluable patient s in the tumor types will be 
based on Investigator/site tumor data RECIST 1.1 assessment.  T his design will ensure a type 
I error of no more than 5% (1-sided) and an 83% power for each of the tumor types.

8.4 Outcome measures for analyses 
8.4.1 Calculation or derivation of efficacy variables 
8.4.1.1  RECIST 1.1-based endpoints 
Investigator RECIST 1.1-based assessments 
All RECIST 1.1 assessments, whether scheduled or unscheduled, w ill be included in the 
calculations.  This is also regardless of whether a patient dis continues study treatment or 
receives another anticancer therapy. 
At each visit, patients w ill be programmatically assigned a RECIST 1.1 visit response of  CR, 
PR, SD, or PD depending on the status of their disease compared  with baseline and previous 
assessments.  Baseline will be assessed within the 28 days prio r to enrollment .  For patients 
who sequence to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab  combination 
therapy following confirmed progression on tremelimumab monothe rapy or during follow-up, 
a new baseline assessment will be recorded prior to the first d ose of sequenced therapy.  If the 
scan confirming PD on tremelimumab monotherapy occurs within 28  days of the first dose of 
sequenced therapy, this scan may be used as the baseline scan f or sequencing to MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremel imumab combination therapy.  If  a patient has had a 
tumor assessment that cannot be evaluated, then the patient wil l be assigned a visit response of 
not evaluable (NE) (unless there is evidence of progression in which case the response will be 
assigned as PD). 
Please refer to Appendix D for the definitions of CR, PR, SD, a nd PD. 
8.4.1.2  Primary endpoint (objective response rate) 
The primary endpoint is ORR.  ORR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed b y the site Investigator) is 
defined as the number (%) of patients with a confirmed overall response of CR or PR and will 
be based on all treated patients who have measurable disease at  baseline per the site 
Investigator.  Therefore, if the site Investigator finds any pa tient who does not have 
measurable disease at baseline, then the analysis of ORR using site Investigator data will 
exclude that patient and the denominator will be all treated pa tients who have measurable 
disease at baseline per the site Investigator. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
109 (178) A confirmed response of CR/PR means that a response of CR/PR is  recorded at 1 visit and 
confirmed by repeat imaging not less than 4 weeks after the vis it when the response was first 
observed with no evidence of progression between the initial an d CR/PR confirmation visit.  
Therefore, data obtained up until progression, or the last eval uable assessment in the absence 
of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR.  Any  patient who discontinues 
treatment without progression, receives a subsequent therapy, a nd then responds will not be 
included as responders in the ORR. 
The above derivation of ORR will be repeated for patients who s equence to MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy. 
For sensitivity analysis in the tremelimumab monotherapy group only, ORR may be assessed 
using the RECIST 1.1 site Investigator tumor data following a m odification where any 
objective progression requires confirmation.  Therefore, data o btained up until confirmed 
progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of  a confirmed progression, may 
be included in the assessment of ORR.  Note that the response m ay be after an unconfirmed 
progression. 
8.4.1.3  Secondary endpoints 
Duration of response 
DoR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the site Investigator) will be defined as the time from the 
date of first documented response until the first date of docum ented progression or death in 
the absence of disease progression.  The end of response should  coincide with the date of 
progression or death from any cause used for the RECIST 1.1 PFS  endpoint.  The 
denominator for DoR will be defined as described for ORR (see S ection 8.4.1.2). 
The time of the initial response will be defined as the latest of the dates contributing toward 
the first visit response of CR or PR.  If a patient does not pr ogress following a response, then 
their DoR will be censored at the PFS censoring time.  DoR will  not be defined for those 
patients who do not have documented response. 
The above derivation of DoR may be repeated for patients who se quence to MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy. 
Sensitivity analyses of DoR may be performed in the tremelimuma b monotherapy group only 
based on Investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1 modifi ed for confirmation of 
progression. 
Disease control rate 
DCR at 4 or 12 months is defined as the percentage of patients who have a best objective 
response (BoR) of CR or PR in the first 4 or 12 months, respect ively, or who have 
demonstrated SD for a minimum interval of 16 or 52 weeks, respe ctively (-7 days, ie, 105 or 
357 days, respectively), following the start of study treatment .  DCR will be determined 
programmatically based on RECIST 1.1 using site Investigator da ta and all data up until the 
first progression event.

Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
110 (178) The above derivation of DCR may be repeated for patients who se quence to MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy. 
Sensitivity analyses of DCR may be performed in the tremelimuma b monotherapy group only 
based on Investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1 modifi ed for confirmation of 
progression. 
Progression-free survival 
PFS (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the site Investigator) will be defined as the time from the 
date of enrollment until the date of objective disease progress ion or death (by any cause in the 
absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withd raws from therapy or receives 
another anticancer therapy prior to progression. 
Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysi s will be censored at the time of 
the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment.  However, if 
the patient progresses or dies after 2 or more missed visits, t he patient will be censored at the 
time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment.  If the pat ient has no evaluable visits or 
does not have baseline data they will be censored at 1 day unle ss they die within 2 visits of 
baseline. 
The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment da tes not visit dates. 
RECIST 1.1 assessments/scans contributing towards a particular visit may be performed on 
different dates.  The following rules will be applied: 
x Date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of  the dates of the 
component that triggered the progression on the first set of sc ans that indicates 
progression. 
x When censoring a patient for PFS, the patient will be censored at the latest of the 
dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment. 
In the absence of clinically significant deterioration, the inv estigational site is advised to 
continue the patients on their respective treatments until prog ression has been confirmed. 
The above derivation of PFS may be repeated for patients who se quence to MEDI4736 
monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremel imumab combination therapy.  PF S (per RECIST 1.1 as 
assessed by the site Investigator) for these patients will be d efined as the time from the date of 
initial treatment with sequenced therapy (ie, either MEDI4736 m onotherapy or MEDI4736 + 
tremelimumab combination therapy) until the date of objective d isease progression or death 
(by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whet her the patient withdraws from 
therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progres sion. 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS may be performed in the tremelimuma b monotherapy group only 
based on Investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1 modifi ed for confirmation of 
progression.

111 (178) Overall survival 
OS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment until dea th due to any cause.  Any 
patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last 
recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. 
Note: Survival calls will be made in the week following the dat e of data cut-off for the 
analysis, and if patients are confirmed to be alive or if the d eath date is post the data cut-off 
date, these patients will be censored at the date of data cut-o ff.  Death dates may be found by 
checking publicly available death registries. 
OS for patients who sequence to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI473 6 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy is defined as the time from the date of ini tial treatment with sequenced 
therapy (ie, either MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelim umab combination 
therapy) until death due to any cause. 
Best objective response 
BoR is calculated based on the overall visit responses from eac h RECIST 1.1 assessment, 
described in Appendix D.  It is the best response a patient has  had during their time in the 
study up until RECIST 1.1 progression (or confirmed progression  where applicable) or the last 
evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST 1.1 progression. 
Categorization of BoR will be based on RECIST 1.1 (Appendix D) using the following 
response categories: CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. 
CR or PR must be confirmed.  BoR will be determined programmati cally based on RECIST 
1.1 using site Investigator data using all data up until the fi rst progression event. 
For patients whose progression event is death, BoR will be calc ulated based upon all 
evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessments prior to death. 
For patients who die with no evaluable REC IST 1.1 assessments, if the death occurs ≤17 
weeks (ie, 16 weeks ±7 days) after enrollment, then BoR will be  assigned to the progression 
(PD) category.  For patients who die with no evaluable RECIST a ssessments, if the death 
occurs >17 weeks (ie, 16 weeks ±7 days) after the date of enrol lment then BoR will be 
assigned to the NE category. 
Progression events that have been censored due to them being >1 7 weeks after the last 
evaluable assessment will not contribute to the BoR derivation.  
Sensitivity analyses of BoR may be performed in the tremelimuma b monotherapy group only 
based on Investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1 modifi ed for confirmation of 
progression.

112 (178) 8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of safety variables 
8.4.2.1  Adverse events 
Data from all cycles of treatment will be combined in the prese ntation of safety data.  AEs 
(both in terms of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred terms 
and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually by patient. 
Any AE occurring before treatment with IP will be included in t he data listings but will not be 
included in the summary tables of AEs.  For AEs, on treatment ( or treatment emergent AEs) 
will be defined as any AE that started after dosing or prior to  dosing and that worsens 
following exposure to the treatment. 
Any AE occurring within 90 days of discontinuation of IP (ie, t he last dose of tremelimumab 
monotherapy, MEDI4736 monotherapy, or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab c ombination therapy) 
will be included in the AE summaries. 
Any events in this period that occur after a patient has receiv ed further therapy for cancer 
(following discontinuation of tremelimumab monotherapy, MEDI473 6monotherapy, or 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy) will be flagged in  the data listings.  A 
separate data listing of AEs occurring more than 90 days after discontinuation of 
tremelimumab monotherapy, MEDI4736monotherapy, or MEDI4736 + tr emelimumab 
combination therapy will be produced.  These events will not be  included in AE summaries. 
8.4.2.2  Safety assessments 
For the change from baseline summaries for vital signs, laborat ory data, ECGs, and physical 
examination, the baseline value will be the latest result obtai ned prior to the start of study 
treatment. 
QTcF will be derived during creation of the reporting database using the reported ECG values 
(RR and QT). 
QTcF = QT/RR^ (1/3) where RR is in seconds 
Corrected calcium will be derived during creation of the report ing database using the 
following formula: 
Corrected calcium (mmol/L) = Total calcium (mmol/L) + ([40 – albumin (G/L)] × 0.02). 
The denominator used in laboratory summaries will only include evaluable patients, in other 
words those who had sufficient data to have the possibility of an abnormality. 
For example: 
x If a CTCAE criterion involves a change from baseline, evaluable  patients would 
have both a pre-dose and at least 1 post-dose value recorded.

Applicable) 
Not applicable to this study. 
8.4.4 Calculation or derivation of pharmacokinetic variables 
8.4.4.1  Population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response/safety analys is 
A population PK model will be developed using a non-linear mixe d-effects modelling 
approach.  The impact of physiologically-relevant patient chara cteristics (covariates) and 
disease on PK will be evaluated.  The relationship between PK e xposure and the effect on 
safety and efficacy endpoints will be evaluated.  The results o f such an analysis will be 
reported in a separate report. 
8.4.4.2  Pharmacokinetic non-compartmental analysis 
The actual sampling times will be used in the PK calculations.  Tremelimumab and 
MEDI4736 concentration data and summary statistics will be tabu lated.  Individual and mean 
blood tremelimumab and MEDI4736 concentration time profiles wil l be generated.  PK 
parameters will be determined using standard non-compartmental methods.  The following PK 
parameters will be determined after the first and steady-state doses: peak and trough 
concentration (as data allow). 
8.4.5 Calculation or derivation of immunogenicity variables 
Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by summar izing the number and 
percentage of patients who develop detectable ADAs for tremelim umab and MEDI4736.  The 
immunogenicity titer will be reported for samples confirmed pos itive for the presence of 
ADAs.  The effect of immunogenicity on PK, pharmacodynamics, ef ficacy, and safety will be 
evaluated. 
8.4.6 Calculation or derivation of biomarker variables 
Biomarker status will be assessed for evaluable patients accord ing to pre-specified criteria that 
will be detailed in the SAP.

114 (178) observed in the first 20 evaluable patients.  If 1 or more resp onse is observed among the first 
20 evaluable patients, then 12 additional patients will be enro lled for a total of 32 patients. 
The primary statistical analyses will be based on a minimax Sim on 2-Stage design (Simon 
1989) algorithm described under Section 8.2.  The data cut-off for the primary analysis of all 
study endpoints including OS will take place approximately 12 m onths after the last patient 
completes 12 months of initial Treme monotherapy, or the last p atient has withdrawn from the 
study, or the study is discontinued by the Sponsor.   A final d ata cut-off of OS and safety will 
be conducted approximately 6 months after the primary analysis data cut-off.   
Efficacy analyses will be reported separately for treatment wit h tremelimumab monotherapy 
and also for patients treated with MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI 4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy.  Similarly, safety analyses will be perfor med for the individual 
treatments (ie, safety analyses for tremelimumab monotherapy, M EDI4736 monotherapy, and 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy). 
All analyses are descriptive, and no statistical testing will b e performed.  Continuous variables 
will be summarized by the number of observations, mean, standar d deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variables will be summarized  by frequency counts and 
percentages for each category .  Unless otherwise stated, percentages w ill be calculated out of 
the population total. 
Baseline for tremelimumab monotherapy will be the last assessme nt of the variable under 
consideration prior to the intake of the first dose of tremelim umab therapy, except for efficacy 
variables.  For efficacy variables, baseline is defined as the last visit prior to enrollment. 
For patients who sequence to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 +  tremelimumab 
combination therapy following confirmed PD on tremelimumab mono therapy or during 
follow-up, baseline will be the last assessment of the variable  under consideration prior to the 
intake of the first dose of MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab 
combination therapy, except for efficacy variables.  For effica cy variables, baseline is defined

8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s) 
The primary analysis of each selected advanced solid tumor will  follow the algorithm of 
testing using a minimax Simon 2-Stage design. 
The primary endpoint, ORR, will be estimated with 95% exact con fidence intervals (CIs).  
The primary analysis will be based on the programmatically deri ved ORR based on site 
Investigator assessments and using all scans, regardless of whe ther they were scheduled or 
not. 
For patients who have confirmed progression on tremelimumab mon otherapy or during 
follow- up and sequence to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + t remelimumab 
combination therapy, the above analyses will be repeated on the  primary variable (ORR). 
Sensitivity analysis may be performed in the tremelimumab monot herapy group only on 
programmatically derived ORR using site Investigator data (RECI ST 1.1 modified for 
confirmation of progression) to determine if there is any diffe rence when using progression 
confirmation rules.

130 (178) Appendix A Additional Safety Information 
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event ( SAE) 
Life threatening 
“Life -threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the pr oduct would result in the patient ’s 
death.  “Life -threatening” does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without he patic failure). 
Hospitalization 
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a se rious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospital ad missions and/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study. 
Important medical event or medical intervention 
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in decidin g whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediatel y life threatening or result in 
death, hospitalization, disability, or incapacity but may jeopa rdize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent 1 or more outcomes listed in th e definition of serious.  These 
should usually be considered as serious. 
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an im portant medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. 
x Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requirin g iv hydrocortisone 
treatment 
x Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose r equiring 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine 
x Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm 
x Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood tra nsfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization 
x Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question 
When making an assessment of causality consider the following f actors when deciding if there 
is a “reasonable possibility”  that an AE may have been caused by the drug. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
131 (178) x Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actual ly received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relati onship to the 
administration of the suspect drug? 
x Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent wit h the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class?  Or could the AE be anticipated from its  pharmacological 
properties? 
x De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stop ping or reducing 
the dose of the suspect drug? 
x No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by  another etiology 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or envi ronmental factors. 
x Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected d rug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped?  AstraZeneca would not normally 
recommend or support a re-challenge. 
x Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if perf ormed) has confirmed 
the relationship. 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
x Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? 
x Is there a known mechanism? 
Causality of “related” is made if, following a review of the re levant data, there is evidence for 
a “reasonable possibility”  of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The express ion 
“reasonable possibility” of a  causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there  are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The causality assessment is performed based on the available da ta including enough 
information to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insu fficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as “not r elated.”  
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.

MEDI4736 and tremelimumab 
There is no information to date on drug-drug interactions with MEDI4736 or tremelimumab 
either preclinically or in pat ients.  As MEDI4736 and tremelimu mab are monoclonal 
antibodies and therefore proteins, they will be degraded to sma ll peptides and amino acids and 
will be eliminated by renal and reticuloendothelial clearance.  It is therefore not expected that 
MEDI4736 or tremelimumab will induce or inhibit the major drug metabolizing cytochrome 
P450 pathways.  As a result, there are no expected pharmacokine tic drug-drug interactions. 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted wit h tremelimumab.  However, 
in renal cell carcinoma studies, acute renal failure has been r eported with the combination of 
tremelimumab and sunitinib. 
The mechanism of action of MEDI4736 involves binding to PD-L1, and the mechanism of 
action of tremelimumab involves binding to CTLA-4; therefore, s ignificant pharmacodynamic 
drug interactions with the commonly administered concomitant me dications are not expected.  
Despite this, appropriate clinical monitoring in all of the pla nned clinical studies will be 
conducted to evaluate any potential drug-drug interactions.

Guidance Document 
Labelling and shipment of biohazard samples 
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classif ies biohazardous agents into 3 
categories.  For transport purposes, the classification of infe ctious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) i n the 46th edition 
(2005).  Infectious substances are now classified either as Cat egory A, Category B, or 
Exempt.  There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups an d Categories A and B. 
Category A  Infectious Substances  are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability or life-t hreatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are,  eg, Ebola, Lassa fever 
virus: 
x Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instructio n 602. 
Category B Infectious Substances  are infectious substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are, eg, Hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2.  They are ass igned the following UN 
number and proper shipping name: 
x UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B 
x Are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 
Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens  
x Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt unde r IATA regulations 
x Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported  at ambient 
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging  
x Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional da ngerous goods 
specification for the dry-ice content  
x IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used f or packing and 
transportation, and packing should be done by an IATA-certified  person, as 
applicable 
x Samples routinely transported by road or rail are subject to lo cal regulations which 
require that they are also packed and transported in a safe and  appropriate way to 
contain any risk of infection or contamination by using approve d couriers and 
packaging/containment materials at all times.  The IATA 650 bio logical sample 
containment standards are encouraged wherever possible when roa d or rail transport 
is used.

134 (178) Appendix C Actions Required in  Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law  
Introduction 
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report cases of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehen sive guide to the management 
of elevated liver biochemistries.  Specific guidance on the man aging liver abnormalities can 
be found in Section 5.2.1 and 6.8 of the protocol. 
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vig ilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry.  The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study . 
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinic al project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree wh ether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explan ation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused  by the Investigational 
Medicinal Product (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining t o PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safety repor ting processes. 
Definitions 
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)  
Aspartate Ami notransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3 × Uppe r Limit of 
Normal (ULN) together with  Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥2 × ULN at any point during the study 
following the start of study medication, irrespective of an inc rease in Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP). 
Hy’s Law (HL)  
AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. 
For PHL and HL, the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timef rame within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. 

Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
In order to identify cases of PHL, it is important to perform a  comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination: 
x ALT ≥3 × ULN  
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
135 (178) x AST ≥3 × ULN  
x TBL ≥2 × ULN  
The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report, and if the 
identification criteria are met will: 
x Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section D efinitions of this 
Appendix for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from a ll previous visits 
x Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF 
Follow-up 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met  
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will : 
x Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to  the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol. 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: 
x Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team. 
The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guida nce, discuss, and agree on an 
approach for the study patient’s follow -up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact the Investigator will: 
x Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and app ropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as l ong as medically 
indicated. 
x Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic in vestigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician. 
x Complete the 3 Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes availa ble. 
x If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the P HL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedur es. 
Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cas es where PHL criteria are met. 
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormality was in itially detected, the Study 
Physician contacts the Investigator in order to review availabl e data and agree on whether 
there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria ot her than DILI caused by the 
Clinical Study Protocol

136 (178) IMP. The AstraZeneca Medical Science Director and Global Safety  Physician will also be 
involved in this review together with other subject matter expe rts as appropriate. 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Inve stigator will follow the 
instructions below. 
If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AS T and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE w ill be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: 
x If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF. 
x If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE  in the eCRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes. 
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP: 
x Report an SAE (report term “Hy’s Law”) according to AstraZeneca  standard 
processes. 
 The “Medically Important” serious criterion should be used if n o other serious 
criteria apply. 
 As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causa lity assessment of 
“related” should be assigned.  
If there is an unavoidable delay of over 3 weeks in obtaining t he information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision  can be made: 
x Report an SAE (report term “Potential Hy’s Law”), applying seri ous criteria and 
causality assessment as per above. 
x Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once t he necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and as sessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report a ccording to the 
outcome of the review. 
Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Befor e and After Starti ng 
Study Treatment 
This section is applicable to patients with liver metastases wh o meet PHL criteria on study 
treatment, having previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment. 
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria bein g met the Investigator will:

Date 13 Sep 2018 
137 (178) x Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient s’ condition# 
compared with the last visit where PHL criteria were met# 
 If there is no significant change no action is required. 
 If there is a significant change notify the AstraZeneca represe ntative, who will 
inform the central Study Team, then follow the subsequent proce ss described is 
Section Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met of this Appendix. 
#A “significant” change in the patient’s condition refers to a c linically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or t otal bilirubin) in isolation or 
in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated s ymptoms.  The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the disc retion of the Investigator; this 
may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any  uncertainty. 
Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potential Hy’s Law  
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on  study treatment and has 
already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit . 
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review, and assessment of  a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.   
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous oc currence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question: 
x Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL cr iteria being met found 
to be the disease under study, eg, chronic or progressing malig nant disease, severe 
infection, or liver disease, or did the patient meet PHL criter ia prior to starting study 
treatment and at his or her first on-study treatment visit as d escribed in Section Actions 
Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and Af ter Starti ng Study 
Treatment? 
If No: follow the process described in Section Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met of this 
Appendix. 
If Yes: 
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient ’s condition# compared with 
when PHL criteria were previously met 
x If there is no significant change, no action is required. 
x If there is a significant change, follow the process described in Section Potential 
Hy’s Law Criteria met  of this Appendix. 
#A “significant” change in the patient’s condition refers to a c linically relevant change in any

139 (178) Appendix D Guidelines for Evaluation of Objective Tumor Respons e 
Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors) 
INTRODUCTION 
This appendix details the implementation of Response Evaluation  Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1 guidelines (Eisenhauer et al 2009) for the D4884C0 0001study with regards to 
Investigator assessment of tumor burden including protocol-spec ific requirements for this 
study. 
DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE, NON-MEASURABLE, TARGET AND NON-
TARGET LESIONS Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be inc luded in the study.  
Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least 1 mea surable (by RECIST 1.1) lesion 
which has not been previously irradiated.  A tumor lesion in a previously irradiated field can 
be assessed as measurable disease provided the lesion has been deemed to demonstrate 
progression. 
Measurable: 
A lesion, not previously irradiated per the protocol prior to e nrollment, that can be accurately 
measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must 
have short axis ≥15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnet ic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and that is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.  A tumor lesion in a previously 
irradiated field can be assessed as measurable disease provided  the lesion has been deemed to 
demonstrate progression. 
Non-measurable: 
x All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <1 0 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to <15 mm short axis at baseline
1). 
x Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: bone lesion s, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory br east disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdo minal 
organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not mea surable by CT or 
MRI. 
x Lesions <2 cm biopsied within the screening period (fresh tumor  biopsy) 
                                                
 
1 Nodes with <10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological a nd should not be recorded or followed as 
non-target lesions (NTLs).

140 (178) x Previously irradiated lesions that have not demonstrated progre ssion2 
x Brain metastasis 
Special cases: 
x Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic –blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue com ponent meets the 
definition of measurability.  Blastic lesions are considered no n-measurable. 
x Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measurability from a radiological point of view, but if non-cys tic lesions are present 
in the same patient, these should be selected as target lesions  (TLs). 
Target lesions: 
A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative 
of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurem ent, should be identified as TLs 
at baseline. 
Non-target lesions: 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL shou ld be identified as NTL at 
baseline. 
METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during foll ow-up visits. 
A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is pr ovided in Table 13, and 
those excluded from tumor assessments for this study are highli ghted with the rationale 
provided. 
                                                
 
2 Localized post-radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may  occur.  Therefore, lesions that have been 
previously irradiated and have not demonstrated progression wil l not be considered measurable and must be 
selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment.

CT and MRI 
CT and MRI are generally considered to be the best currently av ailable and reproducible 
methods to measure TL selected for response assessment and to a ssess NTL and identification 
of any new lesions. 
In the D4884C00001 study, the methods of assessment of tumor bu rden used at baseline and 
follow-up visits are CT/MRI of the chest, abdomen (including li ver and adrenal glands), and 
pelvis, as necessary based on tumor type.  Any other areas of d isease involvement should be 
additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individu al patients.  CT examination 
with intravenous contrast media administration is the preferred  method.  MRI should be used 
where CT is not feasible or it is medically contra indicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI 
is the preferred method. 
Clinical examination 
In the D4884C00001 study, clinical examination will not be used  for assessment of TL. 
Clinically detected lesions can be selected as TLs if they are assessed by CT or MRI scans. 
Clinical examination can be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. 
X-ray 
Plain X-ray In the D4884C00001 study plain X-ray may be used as a method of  assessment for bone NTL 
and to identify the presence of new bone lesions. 
Ultrasound 
In the D4884C00001 study, ultrasound examination will not be us ed for assessment of TL and 
NTL as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an acc urate assessment of tumor size 
and it is subjective and operator dependent.  Ultrasound examin ation can, however, be used to 
identify the presence of new lesions.  If new clinical symptoms  occur and an ultrasound is 
performed then new lesions should be confirmed by CT or MRI exa mination.

142 (178) Endoscopy and laparoscopy 
In the D4884C00001 study, endoscopy and laparoscopy will not be  used for tumor 
assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumor a ssessment. 
Tumor markers 
In the D4884C00001 study, tumor markers will not be used for tu mor response assessments as 
per RECIST 1.1. 
Cytology and histology 
In the D4884C00001 study histology will not be used as part of the tumor response 
assessment as per RECIST 1.1. 
Isotopic bone scan 
Bone lesions identified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline an d confirmed by CT, MRI, or X-
ray at baseline should be recorded as NTL and followed by the s ame method as per baseline 
assessment. 
In the D4884C00001 study, isotopic bone scans may be used as a method of assessment to 
identify the presence of new bone lesions at follow-up visits.  New lesions will be recorded 
where a positive hot-spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is 
identified on a bone scan performed at any time during the stud y.  The Investigator should 
consider the positive hot-spot to be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent 
true disease progression in order to record the new lesion.  Co nfirmation by CT, MRI and X-
ray is recommended where bone scan findings are equivocal. 
FDG-PET scan 
In the D4884C00001 study, 18-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emiss ion tomography (FDG 
PET) scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions,  according with the following 
algorithm:  New lesions will be recorded where there is positiv e 18-Fluoro-deoxyglucose 
uptake3 not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a location correspo nding to a new lesion 
on CT/MRI at the same follow-up visit.  If there is no baseline  FDG-PET scan available, and 
no evidence of new lesions on CT/MRI scans then follow-up CT/MR I assessments should be 
continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in order to confirm new lesions. 
TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
Schedule of evaluation 
RECIST assessments will be performed using CT/MRI assessments o f chest, abdomen 
(including liver and adrenal glands), and pelvis, as necessary based on tumor type.  Additional 
anatomy should be imaged based on signs and symptoms of individ ual patients at baseline and 
follow-up.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more th an 28 days before start of 
tremelimumab monotherapy and, ideally, should be performed as c lose as possible to the start 
                                                
 
3 A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be reported only when an  uptake greater than twice that of the 
surrounding tissue is observed.

143 (178) of treatment (see Table 14 of the Clinical Study Protocol).  Fo r patients who sequence to 
MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination the rapy following 
confirmed PD on tremelimumab monotherapy, a new baseline assess ment should be 
performed no more than 28 days before the start of either MEDI4 736 monotherapy or 
MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and, ideally, as cl ose as possible to the start 
of the sequenced treatment.  If the scan confirming PD on treme limumab monotherapy occurs 
within 28 days of the first dose of sequencing therapy, this sc an may be used as the baseline 
scan for sequencing to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + treme limumab combination 
therapy.  Follow-up assessments will be performed as follows ac cording to tumor type until 
confirmed objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1. 1 (irrespective of the reason 
for stopping treatment and/or subsequent therapy).  Additional tumor types may be added at 
the discretion of the Sponsor. 
x Urothelial bladder cancer and triple-negative breast cancer: Ev ery 8 weeks (±1 
week) relative to the date of first infusion of investigational  product 
x Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: Every 6 weeks (±1 week) for t he first 48 weeks 
relative to the date of first infusion of investigational produ ct and then every 12 
weeks (±1 week) thereafter 
Additional assessments will be performed post confirmed objecti ve disease progression for 
patients remaining on treatment, retreatment, or until subseque nt cancer therapy according to 
the clinical study protocol. 
Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also b e adequately imaged at 
follow-up. 
If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt 
should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their s cheduled visits.  This 
schedule is to be followed in order to minimize any unintention al bias caused by some patients 
being assessed at a different frequency than other patients. 
Target lesions 
Documentation of target lesions 
A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including 
lymph nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (l ongest diameter for non-nodal 
lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition shoul d be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, o n occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circu mstance the next largest 
lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected.  
The site and location of each TL should be documented as well a s the longest diameter for 
non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measure ments should be recorded in 
millimeters.  At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL w ill be calculated and reported as 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
144 (178) the baseline sum of diameters.  At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be 
calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. 
Special cases: 
x For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longe st diameter.  For 
pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, alway s report the short 
axis. 
x If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size o f measurable 
disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. 
x If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter sh ould be recorded as 0 
mm. 
x If a TL splits into two or more parts, then record the sum of t he diameters of those 
parts. 
x If two or more TLs merge then the sum of the diameters of the c ombined lesion 
should be recorded for one of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for  the other lesion(s). 
x If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too s mall to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measu re can be given, this 
should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. 
x If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large , provide an estimate 
of the size of the lesion. 
x When a TL has had any intervention eg, radiotherapy, embolizati on, surgery, during 
the study, the size of the TL should still be provided where po ssible. 
Evaluation of target lesions 
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine objective tumor visit 
response for TL (see Table 14).

Date 13 Sep 2018 
145 (178) Table 14 Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD 
Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters 
of TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is 
the smallest on study).  In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 
mm. 
Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs were not 
assessed or not evaluable or had a lesion 
intervention at this visit.  Note: if the sum of 
diameters meets the progressive disease criteria, progressive disease overrides
 not evaluable as a 
TL response 
Abbr: CR  Complete response; PR  Partial response; PD  Progress ion of disease; NE  Not evaluable; SD  Stable 
disease; TL  Target lesion. 
 
Non-target lesions 
Evaluation of non-target lesions All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL shou ld be identified as NTL at 
baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but  their status should be followed 
at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be 
recorded by the Investigator.  This section provides the defini tions of the criteria used to 
determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigat ional site at each visit (see 
Table 15).

146 (178) Table 15 Evaluation of non-target lesions 
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all NTLs since baseline.  All 
lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size 
(<10 mm short axis). 
Non CR/Non PD Persistence of one or more NTL. 
Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs.  
Unequivocal progression may be due to an 
important progression in one lesion only or in 
several lesions.  In all cases the progression 
MUST be clinically significant for the physician to consider changing (or stopping) therapy. 
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the NTLs 
were not assessed and, in the Investigator’s 
opinion, they are not able to provide an evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit. 
Note: for patients without TLs at baseline, this is 
relevant if any of the NTLs were not assessed at 
this visit and the progression criteria have not 
been met. 
Abbr: CR  Complete response; PD  Progression of disease; NE  No t evaluable; NTL  Non-target lesion; TL  
Target lesion. 
 
To achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of NTLs, ther e must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of stable disease or 
partial response in TLs, the overall tumor burden has increased  sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of  1 or more NTLs is usually not 
sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 
New lesions 
Details of any new lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of 
one or more new lesions is assessed as progression. 
A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease p rogression. 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attr ibutable to differences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thou ght to represent something 
other than tumor. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumor 
assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been c onfirmed.  If repeat scans 
confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should  be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.

Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective r esponse: it is a reason for 
stopping study therapy. 
Patients with “symptomatic deterioration” requiring discontinua tion of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should c ontinue to undergo tumor 
assessments where possible until objective disease progression is observed. 
Evaluation of overall visit response 
The overall visit response will be derived using the algorithm shown in Table 16.

CONFIRMATION OF PROGRESSION 
In the D4884C00001study, imaging for confirmation of response ( complete response or 
partial response) should be performed at next scheduled visit ( and no less than 4 weeks) 
following the date the criteria for response were first met. 
Disease progression requires confirmation.  The confirmatory sc an should occur preferably at 
the next scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of progression 
of disease (PD) in the absence of clinical deterioration. 
Progression would be considered confirmed if the following crit eria are met: 
x ≥20% increase in the sum diameters of TLs compared with the nad ir at 2 
consecutive visits with an absolute increase of 5mm(1) 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab)  
Study Code D4884C00001 Edition Number 4.0 
Date 13 Sep 2018 
148 (178) x And/or significant progression (worsening) of NTLs or new lesio ns at the 
confirmatory PD time-point compared with the first time point w here progression of 
NTLs or new lesions identified 
x And/or additional new unequivocal lesions at the confirmatory P D time-point 
compared with the first time point new lesions identified 
(1)The assessment of progression requires a ≥20% increase in the s um diameters of target 
lesions at the first progression timepoint relative to the nadi r.  The nadir is the smallest sum of 
diameters, and this may be at baseline or subsequent follow-up assessments.  The 
confirmatory scan confirms the persistence of the ≥20% increase  relative to the nadir.  The 
minimum absolute increase in the sum of diameters of target les ions is at least 5 mm at both 
assessments. 
In the absence of significant clinical deterioration the Invest igator should continue treatment 
until progression is confirmed.  If progression is not confirme d, then the patient should 
continue on treatment and on treatment assessments. 
Eligible patients who have confirmed PD on tremelimumab will ha ve the option to be 
sequenced to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab co mbination therapy, 
at the discretion of the Investigator, provided they have not r eceived an alternative cancer 
therapy and still meet continuation criteria as specified in th e main original consent. 
If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subseque nt cancer therapy) prior to 
progression, then the patient should still continue to be follo wed until confirmed objective 
disease progression.

General Considerations 
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management 
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen w ill be made to 
manage potential immune -related AEs based on severity of treatment- emergent 
toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen for the following conditions:  
x Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10  mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks  after last dose of study drug/study 
regimen 
x Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment- related AE 
following resumption of dosing 
Grade 1  No dose modification 
Grade 2  Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to  
Grade ≤1.  
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4. 
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed once event stabilizes t o 
Grade ≤1 after completion of steroid taper.  
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following conditions: 
1. The event stabilizes and is controlled. 
2. The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treatin g 
physician’s clinical judgement.  
3. Doses of prednisone are at ≤10  mg/day or equivalent. 
Grade 3  Depending on the individual toxicity, study drug/study regimen  
may be permanently discontinued. Please refer to guidelines bel ow. 
Grade 4  Permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen. It is recommended that management of immune-mediated adverse ev ents (imAEs) 
follows the guidelines presented in this table: 
− It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune media ted 
mechanism could occur in nearly all organs, some of them not no ted 
specifically in these guidelines. 
− Whether specific immune-mediated events (and/or laboratory indicators of 
such events) are noted in these guidelines or not, patients sho uld be 
thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g. , disease 
progression, concomitant medications, and infections) to a poss ible immune-
mediated even t. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all such eve nts 
should be managed as if they were immune related. General 
recommendations follow. 
− Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low- grade (Grade 
1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events.  
− For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low- grade (Grade 2) or severe (Grade ≥3) 
events, promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equ ivalent.  
− Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality  – e.g., myo-
carditis, or other similar events even if they are not currentl y noted in the 
guidelines – should progress rapidly to high dose IV corticosteroids 
(methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if 
clinical suspicion is high and/or there has been clinical confi rmation. 
Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician, an d promptly 
pursue specialist consultation. 
− If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of 
taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [e.g. , up to 2 to 
4 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improv ement of 
symptoms, then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (>28 days of 
taper). 
− More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (e.g., infliximab) 
(also refer to the individual sections of the imAEs for specifi c type of

General Considerations 
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management 
Note: For Grade ≥3 asymptomati c amylase or lipase levels, hold study drug/study 
regimen, and if complete work up shows no evidence of pancreati tis, study 
drug/study regimen may be continued or resumed.  
Note: Study drug/study regimen should be permanently discontinu ed in Grade 3 
events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or 
other similar events even if they are not currently noted in th e guidelines. 
Similarly, consider whether study drug/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 2 events with high likelihood for morbidi ty and/or mortality 
– e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not  currently noted in 
the guidelines – when they do not rapidly improve to Grade <1 upon treatment 
with systemic steroids and following fu ll taper 
Note: There are some exceptions to permanent discontinuation of  study drug for 
Grade 4 events (i.e., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 d iabetes mellitus).  
 immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not respondi ng to 
systemic steroids. Progression to use of more potent immunosupp ressives 
should pro ceed more rapidly in events with high likelihood for morbidity 
and/or mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are 
not currently noted in the guidelines – when these events are not responding 
to systemic steroids. 
− With long-term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, consider need for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis 
carinii  pneumonia) prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and gluco se 
monitoring. 
− Discontinuation of study drug/study regimen is not mandated for  Grade 
3/Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor resp onse 
(e.g., inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease and lymph nodes). 
Continuation of study drug/study regimen in this situation shou ld be based 
upon a benefit-risk analysis for that patient.

Pediatric Considerations 
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management 
The criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study regimen based on 
CTC grade/severity is the same for pediatric patients as it is for adult patients, as 
well as to permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen if unable to reduce 
corticoste roid ≤  a dose equivalent to that required for corticosteroid replacement  
therapy within 12 weeks after last dose of study drug/study regimen − All recommendations for specialist consultation should occur wi th a 
pediatric specialist in the specialty recommended. 
− The recommendations for dosing of steroids (i.e., mg/kg/day) an d for IV IG 
and plasmapheresis that are provided for adult patients should also be used 
for pediatric patients. 
− The infliximab 5 mg/kg IV dose recommended for adults is the sa me as 
recommen ded for pediatric patients ≥ 6 years old.  For dosing in childr en 
younger than 6 years old, consult with a pediatric specialist.

Pneumonitis/Interstitial 
Lung Disease (ILD)  Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or 
ILD (new onset or worsening shortness of breath or cough). 
Patients should be evaluated with imaging and pulmonary 
function tests, including other diagnostic procedures as 
described below. 
− Initial work- up may include clinical evaluation, monitoring of 
oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), 
laboratory work-up, and high- resolution CT scan. 
Grade 1  
(asymptomatic, clinical 
or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not 
indicated)
 No dose modifications required. 
However, consider holding study 
drug/study regimen dose as clinically 
appropriate and during diagnostic work-
up for other etiologie s. For Grade 1 (radiographic changes only):  
− Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and laboratory work-up and then as clinically indicated. 
− Consider Pulmonary and Infectious disease consult. 
Grade 2  
(symptomatic; medical 
intervention indicated; 
limiting instrumental 
ADL)  Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.  
x If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4. 
x If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then the decision to reinitiate study 
drug/study regimen will be based 
upon treating physician’s clinical 
judgment and after completion of 
steroid taper. For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):  
− Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospitalization. 
− Promptly start systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 1 to 
2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent). 
− Reimage as clinically indicated. 
− If no improvement within 3 to 5 days, additional workup 
should be considered and prompt treatment with IV 
methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day started 
− If still no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite IV 
methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, promptly start 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors 
(e.g., infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis a nd refer to infliximab label for 
general guidance before using infliximab. 
− Once the patient is improving, gradually taper steroids over 
≥28 days and consider prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, or  
anti-PJP treatment (refer to current NCCN guidelines for

Diarrhea/Colitis  Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor for symptoms that may be related to 
diarrhea/enterocolitis (abdominal pain, cramping, or changes 
in bowel habits such as increased frequency over baseline or 
blood in stool) or related to bowel perforation (such as sepsis , 
peritoneal signs, and ileus). 
− Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, other 
medications, or infections), including testing for clostridium 
difficile toxin, etc. 
− Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear 
alternative etiology, even for low- grade events, in order to 
prevent potential progression to higher grade event. 
− Use analgesics carefully; they can mask symptoms of 
perforation and peritonitis.

section)  
 Any Grade  
(depending on the type 
of endocrinopathy, 
refer to NCI CTCAE 
v4.03 for defining the 
CTC grade/severity) General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Consider consulting an endocrinologist for endocrine events. 
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with study physician. 
− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. 
Non- specific symptoms include headache, fatigue, behavior 
changes, changed mental status, vertigo, abdominal pain, 
unusual bowel habits, p olydipsia, polyuria, hypotension, and 
weakness. 
− Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression including brain  
metastases, or infections). 
− Depending on the suspected endocrinopathy, monitor and 
evaluate thyroid function tests: TSH, free T3 and free T4 and 
other relevant endocrine and related labs (e.g., blood glucose 
and ketone levels, HgA1c). 
− For modest asymptomatic elevations in serum amylase and 
lipase, corticosteroid treatment is not indicated as long as 
there are no other signs or symptoms of pancreatic 
inflammation. 
− If a patient experiences an AE that is thought to be possibly 
of autoimmune nature (e.g., thyroiditis, pancreatitis, 
hypophysitis, or diabetes insipidus), the investigator should 
send a blood sample for appropriate autoimmune antibody 
testing. 
 
Grade 1  No dose modifications.  For Grade 1 (including those with asymptomatic TSH elevation): 
− Monitor patient with appropriate endocrine function tests.  
− For suspected hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, consider 
consultation of an endocrinologist to guide assessment of 
early-morning ACTH, cortisol, TSH and free T4; also 
consider gonadotropins, sex hormones, and prolactin levels, 
as well as cosyntropin stimulation test (though it may not be 
usefu l in diagnosing early secondary adrenal insufficiency). 
− If TSH < 0.5 × LLN, or TSH >2 × ULN, or consistently out 
of range in 2 subsequent measurements, include free T4 at

as clinically indicated, consider pituitary scan. 
− For all patients with abnormal endocrine work up, except 
those with isolated hypothyroidism or Type 1 DM, and as 
guided by an  endocrinologist, consider short-term 
corticosteroids (e.g., 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or 
IV equivalent) and prompt initiation of treatment with 
relevant hormone replacement (e.g., hydrocortisone, sex 
hormones). 
− Isolated hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement 
therapy, without study drug/study regimen interruption, and 
without corticosteroids. 
− Isolated Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) may be treated with 
appropriate diabetic therapy, without study drug/study 
regimen interruption, and without corticosteroids. 
− Once patients on steroids are improving, gradually taper  
immunosuppressive steroids (as appropriate and with 
guidance of endocrinologist) over ≥28 days and consider 
prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, and anti- PJP treatment 
(refer to current NCCN guidelines for treatment of cancer -
related infections [Category 2B recommendation]).a 
− For patients with normal endocrine workup (laboratory 
assessment or MRI scans), repeat laboratory 
assessments/MRI as clinically indicated. 
Grade 3 or 4  For Grade 3 or 4 endocrinopathy other 
than hypothyroidism and Type 1 diabetes 
mellitus, hold study drug/study regimen 
dose until endocrinopathy symptom(s) 
are controlled.

 General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (e.g., disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes, or medications). 
− Monitor patient for general symptoms (headache, nausea, 
vertigo, behavior change, or weakness). 
− Consider appropriate diagnostic testing (e.g., 
electromyogram 
and nerve conduction investigations). 
− Perform symptomatic treatment with neurological consult as 
appropriate. 
−  
Grade 1  No dose modifications.  For Grade 1:  
− See “Any Grade” recommendations above.

165 (178) If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or 4. 
Study drug/study regimen can be 
resumed once event improves to Grade 
≤1 and after completion of steroid taper.  − If no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite 1 to 
2 mg/kg/day prednisone PO or IV equivalent, consider 
additional workup and promptly treat with additional immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., IV IG). 
Grade 3 or 4  For Grade 3:  
Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
resolution to Grade ≤1.  
Permanently discontinue study 
drug/study regimen if Grade 3 imAE 
does not resolve to Grade ≤1 within 30 
days.  
 
For Grade 4:  
Permanently discontinue study 
drug/study regimen.  For Grade 3 or 4:  
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with study physician. 
− Obtain neurology consult. 
− Consider hospitalization. 
− Promptly initiate empiric IV methylprednisolone 1 to 
2 mg/kg/day or equivalent. 
− If no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite IV 
corticosteroids, consider additional workup and promptly 
treat with additional immunosuppressants (e.g., IV IG). 
− Once stable, gradually taper ster oids over ≥28 days.  
Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes  
(such as Guillain -Barre 
and myasthenia gravis) Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients 
may unpredictably experience acute decompensations that 
can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death . 
Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent 
dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and signs of 
respiratory insufficiency or autonomic instability. 
− Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (e.g., disease progression, infections, metabolic 
syndromes or medications). It should be noted that the 
diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes can be particularly challenging in patients with 
underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding 
effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis.  
Given the importance o f prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is 
essential to have a low threshold to obtain a neurological 
consult. 
− Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (e.g., electromyogram 
and nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive 
stimulation” if myasthenia is suspecte d) are routinely 
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 13 Sep 2018 
166 (178) indicated upon suspicion of such conditions and may be best 
facilitated by means of a neurology consultation. 
− It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the 
primary treatment of Guillain-Barre is not typically 
considered effec tive. Patients requiring treatment should be 
started with IV IG and followed by plasmapheresis if not 
responsive to IV IG. 
 
Grade 1  No dose modifications.  For Grade 1:  
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician. 
− Care should be taken to monitor patients for sentinel 
symptoms of a potential decompensation as described above. 
− Obtain a neurology consult. 
Grade 2  Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
resolution to Grade ≤1.  
Permanently discontinue study 
drug/study regimen if it does not resolve 
to Grade ≤1 within 30 days or if there are 
signs of respiratory insufficiency or autonomic instability.
 For Grade 2:  
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician. 
− Care should be taken to monitor patients for sentinel 
symptoms of a po tential decompensation as described above. 
− Obtain a neurology consult 
− Sensory neuropathy/neuropathic pain may be managed by 
appropriate medications (e.g., gabapentin or duloxetine). 
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS: 
o Steroids may be successfully used to treat 
myasthenia gravis. It is important to consider that 
steroid therapy (especially with high doses) may 
result in transient worsening of myasthenia and 
should typically be administered in a monitored 
setting under supervision of a consulting 
neurologist. 
o Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be 
candidates for treatment with plasmapheresis or IV 
IG. Such decisions are best made in consultation 
with a neurologist, taking into account the unique 
needs of each patient. 
o If myasthenia gravis- like neurotoxicity is present, 
consider starting AChE inhibitor therapy in addition 
to steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also 
serve to reinforce the diagnosis.

Myocarditis  Any Grade  General Guidance  
Discontinue drug permanently if biopsy-
proven immune -mediated myocarditis. For Any Grade:  
− The prompt diagnosis of immune- mediated myocarditis is 
important, particularly in patients with baseline 
cardiopulmonary disease and reduced cardiac function.  
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.

168 (178) − Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myocarditis (new 
onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of 
breath, peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap 
with lung toxicities, simultaneously evaluate for and rule out 
pulmonary toxicity as well as other causes (e.g., pulmonary 
embolism, congestive heart failure, malignant pericardial 
effusion). A Cardiology consultation should be obtained 
early, with prompt assessment of whether and when to 
complete a cardiac biopsy, including any other diagnosti c 
procedures. 
− Initial work-up should include clinical evaluation, BNP, 
cardiac enzymes, ECG, echocardiogram (ECHO), monitoring 
of oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
additional laboratory work-up as indicated. Spiral CT or 
cardiac MR I can complement ECHO to assess wall motion 
abnormalities when needed. 
− Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, other 
medications, or infections) 
 Grade 1  
(asymptomatic with 
laboratory (e.g.,  BNP) 
or cardiac imaging 
abnormalities ) No dose modifications required unless 
clinical suspicion is high, in which case 
hold study drug/study regimen dose 
during diagnostic work -up for other 
etiologies.  If study drug/study regimen is 
held, resume after complete resolution to 
Grade 0.  For Grade 1 (no definitive findings):  
- Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms,  BNP, cardiac enzymes, ECG, ECHO, pulse 
oximetry (resting and exertion), and laboratory work- up as 
clinically indicated.  
- Consider using steroids if clinical suspicion is high.  
 Grade 2, 3 or 4  
(Grade 2: Symptoms 
with mild to moderate 
activity or exertion ) 
 
 (Grade 3: Severe with 
symptoms at rest or 
with minimal activity 
or exertion; 
intervention indicated) 
 - If Grade 2 -- Hold study drug/study 
regimen dose until resolution to 
Grade 0. If toxicity rapidly improves 
to Grade 0, then the decision to 
reinitiate study drug/study regimen 
will be based upon treating 
physician’s clinical judgment and 
after completion of steroid taper. If 
toxicity does not rapidly improve, 
permanently. discontinue study 
drug/study regimen. For Grade 2 -4: 
− Monitor symptoms daily, hospitalize. 
− Promptly start IV methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day or 
equivalent after Cardiology consultation has determined 
whether and when to complete diagnostic procedures 
including a cardiac biopsy. 
− Supportive care (e.g., oxygen). 
− If no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite IV 
methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, promptly start 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors (e.g., infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis and refer to infliximab label for 
general guidance before using infliximab.

anti-PJP treatment (refer to current NCCN guidelines for 
treatment of cancer-related infections [Category 2B 
recommendation]).a 
Myositis/Polymyositis 
(“Poly/myositis”)  Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of poly/myositis. 
Typically, muscle weakness/pain occurs in proximal muscles 
including upper arms, thighs, shoulders, hips, neck and back, but rarely affects the extremities including hands and fingers;  
also difficulty breathing and/or trouble swallowing can occur 
and progress rapidly. Increased general feelings of tiredness 
and fatigue may occur, and there can be new- onset falling, 
difficulty getting up from a fall, and trouble climbing stairs,  
standing up from a seated position, and/or reaching up. 
− If poly/myositis is suspected, a Neurology consultation 
should be obtained early, with prompt guidance on diagnostic 
procedures. Myocarditis may co- occur with poly/myositis; 
refer to guidance under Myocarditis. Given breathing 
complications, refer to guidance under Pneumonitis/ILD.  
Given possibility of an existent (but previously unknown) 
autoimmune disorder, consider Rheumatology consultation. 
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician. 
− Initial work- up should include clinical evaluation, creatine 
kinase, aldolase, LDH, BUN/creatinine, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level, urine 
myoglobin, and additional laboratory work- up as indicated, 
including a number of possible rheumatological/antibody 
tests (i.e., consider whether a rheumatologist consultation is 
indicated and could guide need for rheumatoid factor, 
antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle, antisynthetase [such as anti-Jo-1], and/or signal-recognition particle 
antibodies). Confirmatory testing may include 
electromyography, nerve co nduction studies, MRI of the

Protocol synopsis 
Previous text:  
The data cut-off for the primary analysis of all study endpoint s including OS, will take place approximately 12 months after t he last 
patient completes 12 months of initial Treme Monotherapy, or th e last patient has withdrawn from the study, or the study is 
discontinued by the Sponsor.

patient completes 12 months of initial Treme Monotherapy, or th e last patient has withdrawn from the study, or the study is 
discontinued by the Sponsor.  A final data cut-off of OS and sa fety will be conducted approximately 6 months after the primary  
analysis data cut-off.    
Reason for Amendment:  
Make consistency with section 8.5 with final DCO of OS and safe ty added.

6.3.12 Safety Data To Be Collected following the final DCO of t he study 
Previous text: 
For patients continuing to receive investigational product afte r final DCO and database closure, assessments will revert to th e 
Investigator’s standard of care. It is recommended that investi gators monitor the patient’s safety laboratory results prior t o and 
periodically during treatment with investigational product in o rder to manage AEs in accordance with the toxicity management 
guidelines (Appendix E and Section 6.8.1). All data post the fi nal DCO and database closure will be recorded in the patient no tes 
but, with the exception of Serious Adverse Events, will not oth erwise be reported for the purposes of this study.

continue the scheduled site visits and Investigat ors monitor the patient’s safety laboratory results prior to an d periodically during 
treatment inorder to manage AEs in accordance with the Dose Mod ification and Toxicity Management Guidelines (see Section 
6.8.1 and Appendix E). All data post the final DCO and database  closure will be recorded in the patient notes but, with the 
exception of SAEs, will not otherwise be reported for the purpo ses of this study.     
All SAEs that occur in patients still receiving investigational  product (or within the 90 days following the last dose of    t he   last 
study treatment) post the final DCO and database closure must b e reported as detailed in Section    6.4,  using the paper form  
process. 
Reason for Amendment: 
Update to safety data collection following the final DCO of the  study.

Previous text:  
Post final Data Cut off (DCO) Efficacy scans will be collected in accordance with local clini cal practice. Patients who are still in treatment of investigat ional 
product following the final DCO and database closure it is reco mmended that the patients continue the scheduled site visits an d 
investigators monitor the patient’s safety laboratory results p rior to and periodically during treatment with investigational  product in 
order to manage AEs in accordance with the toxicity management guidelines (please see Section 6.8.1).  For patients continuing  to 
receive investigational product after final DCO and database cl osure, assessments will revert to the Investigator’s standard of care. 
It is recommended that investigators monitor the patient’s safe ty laboratory results prior to and periodica lly during treatment with

6.8.1).       
Revised text:  Post final Data Cut off (DCO) 
Efficacy scans will be collected in accordance with local clini cal practice. Patients who are still in progression-free follow  up 
following the final DCO and database closure are to undergo sam pling for local laboratory assessments in such a way that 
continued per-protocol eligibility for retreatment or sequencin g with IP can be properly determined (Figure 4). For patients 
receiving retreatment or sequencing with IP following the final  DCO and database closure, it is recommended that the patients 
continue the scheduled site visits and Investigators mon itor the patients’ safety laboratory results prior to and perio dically during 
treatment with IP in order to manage AEs in accordance with the  Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines 
(Section 6.8.1 and Appendix E). 
In the event that a roll-over or safety extension study is avai lable at the time of the final DCO and database closure, patien ts 
currently receiving treatment with IP may be transitioned to su ch a study, and the current study would reach its end. The roll -over 
or safety extension study would ensure treatment continuation w ith visit assessments per its protocol. Any patient who would b e 
proposed to move to such a study would be given a new Informed Consent. 
Reason for Amendment: 
To clarify patient management post DCO.

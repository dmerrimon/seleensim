CONFIDENTIAL  Study design:  This i s an open -label, multicenter, Phase 1b, dose -finding study of carfilzomib 
administered once weekly in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) .  
Once -weekly carfilzomib in a KRd r egimen will be evaluated in RRMM and NDMM 
subjects.   
There will  be 2 parts in the study : Dose Evaluation and Dose Expansion.   
Prior to protocol amendment 2
Two dose levels of once -weekly  carfilzomib in a KRd regimen (Cohort 1 and C ohort  2) 
will be evaluated  during the Dose -evaluation Component  in RRMM subjects ; a third 
optional KRd regimen (with a reduced dose level of lenalidomide) may also be evaluated  
(Cohort 3) .  Approximately 8 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)  evaluable RRMM subjects 
will be enrolled into each opened Dose -evaluation cohort.   : 
The second part is the Dose -expansion Component during which approximately  
60 subjects (30 RRMM and 30 NDMM subjects) will receive the KRd regimen selected 
in the Dose -evaluation Component.  
Per protocol amendment 2
NDMM subjects will be enrolled into an additional Dose -evalua tion Cohort 4 .  
Approximately 8 DLT -evaluable subjects will be treated with carfilzomib given once  
weekly with 2 -step-up dosing in a KRd regimen .  The Cohort Safety Review Committee 
(CSRC) may then elect to open enrollment  to a Dose -expansion Component for an 
additional 30  NDMM subjects.  : 
Subjects may continue to receive study treatment for up to 18 cycles.  Newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma  subjects may interrupt therapy after cycle 4 for autologous stem cell 
transplant ( ASCT ).   
All subjects will be evaluated for safety at an End of Treatment (EOT) visit, 28 ± 7 days 
after the last study treatment, and with an EOT echocardiogram (ECHO), done within 
28 ± 7 days after the last study treatment.  
Following the EOT, subjects who have not had disease progression or allogeneic stem 
cell transplant will enter Active  Follow -up.   
Number of 
investigational sites:  Approximately 30 sites 
Planned number 
of subjects: Approximately 114 subjects in total.  
Prior to protocol amendment 2 , 56 RRMM and 20 NDMM subjects were enrolled in the 
study.  Twenty -two RRMM subjects were enrolled in to the RRMM Dose -evaluation 
Component ; 34 RRMM subjects were enrolled into the RRMM Dose -expansion 
Component of the study .  Enrollment of RRMM subjects is completed.  
Per protocol amendment 2
NDMM subjects enrolled prior to protocol amendm ent 2 who are DLT -evaluable at 
Cohort 4 dosing will be considered  Cohort 4 subjects . , approximately  38 NDMM subjects will be enrolled in the 
study:  approximately 8  subjects will be enrolled in to the NDMM Dose -evaluation 
Component, and approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled in the  second NDMM 
Dose -expansion Component of the study.  
Sample size 
justification: Sample sizes are determ ined to provide preliminary information on safety, clinical 
activity, PDn, and
 PK.  With respect to safety, 38 subjects with relapsed disease in the 
dose 
cohort selected to move into the expansion component  and 38 NDMM subjects  will 
allow  an approximately 86% probability  to detect an occurrence of an adverse event 
(AE) with 5% incidence rate.   
Study population:  Subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy  
and subjects with newly diagnosed, transplant -eligible or transplant- ineligible multiple 
myeloma.

CONFIDENTIAL  Treatment and 
assessments:  Treatment cycles are 28 days in duration and consist of KRd combination treatment as described above. 
 
 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety 
variables:  Safety and tolerability will be assessed by incidence and severity of AEs and changes from baseline of all relevant parameters, including laboratory values, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) , and ECHO .  Severity of AEs will be assessed according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE; version 4.03) .  All subjects will be monitored for AEs for 30 days after the last 
administration of study treatment.   
Efficacy variables:  Disease assessments according to the IMWG -Unifo
 rm Response Criteria (URC) will be 
conducted at Screening (within 21 days before dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1) and then at 
Cycle  2 Day 1 and on Day 1 ± 3 days of every cycle thereafter for up to 18 cycles.  
Minimal  r
esidual disease (MRD) status will be assessed by using flow cytometry (FC) of 
cell surface markers and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of DNA and/or RNA from 
the Ig locus.  The MRD analysis by FC will be performed on bone marrow aspirated at 
2 time poin ts:  Cycle 8 Day 1, and upon achieving a CR or sCR.  The MRD analysis by 
NGS will be performed using blood and bone marrow aspirates collected at 3 time points:  
baseline, Cycle 8 Day 1, and upon achieving a CR  or sCR. 
PK: For both the Dose -evaluation and  the Dose -expansion Components, b lood samples will be 
collected from all subjects  on Day 8 of Cycle 1  for determination of plasma 
concentrations of carfilzomib .  On the day of blood collection, blood will be collected  at 
predose, 15 minutes after the start of the infusion, immediately prior to (within 2 minutes before) the end of the infusion, and 15 and 60 minutes after the end of the infusion.  
PDn:  Whole blood will be collected from all subjects in the Dose -evaluation Component , and 
the first 8 subjects enrolled in Dose -expansion Arm 3,  on Days 1 , 8, 9, and 11 of 
Cycle  1.  On Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 whole blood will be collected pre -carfilzomib dose 
and post -carfilzomib dose.  On Days 9 and 11 of Cycle 1, whe n carfilzomib is not 
administered, one PDn sample will be collected at approximately the same time as when the pre -infusion sample was taken on Day 8.  
 
Genomics:  Analysis of genetic s, ge ne expression, and cell surface biomarkers that may predict for 
response and resistance to treatment with prot
easome inhibitors  will be performed.  
Expl
oratory studies will be conducted on all subjects who consent to optional genomic 
biomarker analysis.  These analyses will be performed on bone marrow aspirate (the remaining portion of the bone marrow aspirate sample left after the amount required for 
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis has been collected at baseline), as well as a sample of blood and saliva also collected at the time of baseline.  At prog ression, an 
optional additional bone marrow sample for biomarker analysis may be collected  from all 
subjects who consent.  
Whole 
genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), whole transcriptome 
sequencing (RNA -Seq), and/or other methods of nucleic  acid and protein quantification 
will be conducted on isolated tumor (CD138+) cells from these bone marrow aspirate 
samples.  In addition, WGS or WES will be performed on a normal tissue sample (eg, 
CD3+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood  or saliva) to  distinguish germ line mutations 
from somatic mutations in tumor cell samples.  
Other:  Subject convenience and satisfaction with the carfilzomib dosing schedule will be assessed by questionnaire at Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 18 Day  1. 
Statistical 
methods and 
analyses:  All safety and efficacy analyses will be based upon the Safety Population, defined as subjects receiving treatment with at least 1 dose of carfilzomib.  In addition, response data 
(overall response rate [ORR], complete response rate [CRR], progr ession -free survival 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib  Page 9 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical 
methods and 
analyses (cont’d):  [PFS], duration of response [DOR]) may also be  analyzed based on the 
Response -evaluable Population, defined as subjects who are included in the Safety 
Population, have a baseline disease assessment and at least 1 postbaseline disease assessment, or dropped out due to AE prior to the first postbaseline disease assessment.  
Primary Endpoints
• Safety and tolerability of carfilzomib administered once weekly in combination 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, as defined by the type, incidence, and 
severity of AEs, and changes from baseline in key laboratory analyses , 
including immunoglobulin levels, vital signs, and the extent and duration of exposure to study drugs.   : 
All treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term, NCI CTCAE grade, and 
investigator assessment of causality.  In addition, all serious adverse events (SAEs), including deaths, will be lis ted separately.  Extent of exposure to the 
study treatment will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics and by postdose 
shifts relative to baseline.  Vital signs will also be summarized descriptively for 
each scheduled protocol time point.   
Secondary Endpoints
• Pharmacokinetics (PK) of carfilzomib  : 
• Overall Response Rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a best overall response of stringent complete response (sC R), CR, very 
good partial response (VGPR), or PR in accordance with IMWG -URC  
• Complete Response Rate (CRR), defined as the proportion of subjects who 
achieve a best overall response of either sCR or CR in accordance with 
IMWG -URC  
• Progression -free Survival  (PFS), defined as the time from the first day of study 
treatment to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause  
• Duration of Response (DOR), defined as the time from the first evidence of confirmed PR or better to disease progression or death due to any cause among subjects who respond  
Point estimates for ORR and CRR along with their exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals 
will be calculated.  The distribution of time -to-event endpoints (PFS and DOR) will be 
summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method.   
Safety and efficacy analyses will be performed by dose levels and by populations (newly 
diagnosed and relapsed).  
Pharmacokinetics
The PK parameter estimates for carfilzomib will be summarized, including total plasma exposure (e xpressed as area under the curve; AUC), maximum plasma concentration 
(C
max), time to maximum plasma concentration (T max), total plasma clearance, and plasma 
terminal half -life (as appropriate for data collected).  Estimates for these parameters will 
be tabulated and summarized (ie, mean, standard deviation).  The PK parameters will be summarized descriptively.  :  
Exploratory Endpoints
• Pharmacodynamics (PDn) of proteasome inhibition by carfilzomib measured in 
whole blood  : 
• MRD[ -] rate, defined as the proportion of subjects who have negative MRD at 
Cycle 8 Day 1.  Point estimates for MRD[ -] rate along with exact 2 -sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated for both MRD assessment methods   
• Subject convenience and satisfaction with the carfilzomib dosing schedule.   
• WGS, WES, whole transcriptome sequencing, and other nucleic acid and 
protein quantification data and immunoglobulin levels in tumor cells  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib  Page 10 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  WGS, WES, RNA -Seq, and/or other nucleic acid and protein quantification data will be 
analyzed to characterize whether drug response is related to alterations in genes regulated 
by or involved in activation of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF -Kappa B) transcripti on factors as well as in genes involved in immunoglobulin 
production and protein homeostasis.  Immunoglobulin levels in tumor cells will be quantified by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and/ or other protein 
quantification methods.  The genomic d ata as a whole will also be used to derive new 
hypotheses about mechanisms of drug response, resistance, and safety.

3.1 INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Kyprolis  (Carfilzomib for I njection [carfilzomib]) is a proteasome inhibitor that received 
accelerated approval from the United States ( US) Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in 
July 2012 for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who  have received at least 2 
prior therapies, including bortezomib and an IMiD and have demonstrated disease 
progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.  The approval was bas ed 
on the results of the Study PX-171-003 – Part 2 (A1) in 266 subjects with relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma .  Subsequent full approval in the US and European Union was 
based on two phase 3 trials: PX-171-009 (ASPIRE) and 2011- 003 (ENDEAVOR).  
Following these approvals, Kyprolis in combination with either lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone is indicated for treatment of relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma (RRMM) . 
The study detailed in the current protocol will evaluate several dose levels of carfilzomib  in 
combination with len alidomide and dexamethasone.   
RRMM  and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ( NDMM ) subjects will be treated with 
carfilzomib  given  once weekly in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid) and 
dexamethasone as part of  a carfilzomib (K), lenalidomide (R) and dex amethasone (d) 
regimen  (KRd).  C arfilzomib will be giv en as a 30 -minute infusion once weekly for the first 
3 weeks of a 4-week ( 28-day) cycle  as part of a KRd regimen .   
This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of once- weekly carfilzomib regimen s in 
subjects with relapsed  multiple myeloma  or newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.   
3.2 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  
Multiple myeloma, a clonal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells, is the second most common hematologic malignancy and is responsible for approximately 72,000 annual deaths 
worldwide ( Ferlay 2010) .  There are an estimated 11,000 deaths per year in the US and more 
than 19,000 deaths per year in Europe ( American Cancer So ciety 2014; Boyle  2005) .  
Multiple myeloma is characterized by anemia, bone destruction, monoclonal gammopathy, 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib  Page 22 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  renal failure, hypercalcemia, and increased susceptibility to infections.  The disease is 
systemic and chemo therapy is indicated for management of symptomatic myeloma.   
Current treatment options for people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma commonly 
include combination chemotherapy with regimens consisting of melphalan (Alkeran), 
bortezomib (Velcade), thalidomide (Thalomid), and lenalidomide (Revlimid) with or without 
corticosteroids such as dexamethasone or prednisone.  For people whose tolerance is not 
limited by age or co -morbidities, the preferred treatment  is standard chemotherapy or VRd 
followed by high dose, myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous stem ce ll 
transplantation  (ASCT).  
Despite improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) over the 
past 15 years, essentially all p atients eventually relapse even with the best available approved 
treatments .   
3.3 NOVEL THERAPIES FOR MULTIPLE MYELOMA  
3.3.1 PROTEASOME BACKGROUN D 
Proteasome inhibition has emerged as an important therapeutic strategy in multiple myeloma (Moreau 2012 ).  The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex that is responsible for 
degradation of a wide variety of protein substrates within normal and malignant cells.  
Intracellular proteins targeted for degradation by the proteasome are first ubiquitinated via 
the ubiquitin conjugation system.  Ubiquitinated proteins are cleaved within the proteasome 
by 1 or more of 3 separate N -terminal threonine protease activities:  a  chymotrypsin -like 
activity, a trypsin -like activity, and a caspase- like activity.   
3.3.2 CARFILZOMIB BACKGROU ND (NONCLINICAL)  
Carfilzomib  is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone-based inhibitor of the chymotrypsin- like activity 
of the 20S proteasome.  It is structurally and mechanistically different from the dipeptide 
boronic acid proteasome inhibitor bortezomib  and showed less off- target activity when 
measured against a broad panel of proteases including metallo -, aspartyl -, and serine 
proteases compared to bortezomib; the latter showed off- target inhibitory activity in the 
nanomolar range against sever al serine proteases (Arastu -Kapur 2009) .  This selectivity may 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib  Page 23 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  be responsible for the reductions in myelosuppression and neuropathy observed in 
nonclinical studies comparing carfilzomib with bortezomib.  
Based upon in vitro and in vivo studies, it is anticipated that a more intense and sustained 
proteasome inhibition can be achieved with carfilzomib relative to bortezomib, resulting in 
enhanced antitumor activity.  Continuous 72-hour exposure to carfilzomib was associated 
with potent cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity across a broad panel of tumor- derived cell 
lines in culture (Demo 2007) .  Incubation of hematologic tumor cell lines with carfilzomib 
for as little as 1 hour led to rapid inhibition of proteasome activity followed by accumulation 
of polyubiquitinated proteins and induction of apoptotic cell death.  Carfilzomib was also 
cytotoxic in bortezomib -resistant tumor cell lines (Suzuki 2011; Kuhn 2007 ). 
Nonclinical studies in rats and monkeys have been performed administering carfilzomib IV 
for 5 consecutive days followed by 9 days of rest for 2 cycles.  Proteasome inhibition of more 
than 80% was achieved, suggestin g that high -level inhibition of the proteasome with the 
epoxyketone class is possible, affording new opportunities to escalate dose to optimize antitumor effects (Yang 2011) .  This finding was in contrast to nonclinical test ing with the 
boronate class of inhibitors that prohibited uninterrupted daily dosing due to substantial morbidity and mortality.  Carfilzomib has also been administered to rats and monkeys for 6 
and 9 months, respectively (once daily × 2:  once daily dosing for 2 consecutive days for 
3 weeks on a 28- day cycle).  Carfilzomib was well tolerated at doses resulting in more than 
80% proteasome inhibition, with no behavioral or histological evidence of peripheral neuropathy (PN) and no neutropenia ( current  Carfil zomib Investigator’s Brochure [IB] ).  In 
contrast, rats and monkeys treated with bortezomib in chronic toxicity studies were shown to have reduced motor activity, convulsions, tremors, and hind- limb paralysis accompanied by 
histological degeneration in peripheral nerves, as well as significant neutropenia (Velcade [bortezomib] full p rescribing information [ Millennium Pharmaceuticals 2012] ; Velcade 
Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] 2012  [High Wycombe, Bucks, UK 2012] ). 
3.3.3 CARFILZOMIB BACKGROU ND (CLINICAL)  
Carfilzomib entered clinical studies in September 2005.   
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib  Page 24 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  As of 10 July 2016, an estimated 4833 subjects and 4114 subject- years have been exposed to 
carfilzomib in clinical trials conducted by Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. since the beginning of the 
development program.   
Carfilzomib has been administered on 2 consecutive days weekly for 3 weeks in a 28- day 
cycle in most studies conducted to date.   
Study PX -171-006 was the first to explore the option of combination therapy  using 
carfilzomib and lenolidamide (the IMiD most widely employed for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma; Wang 2013) .  This investigation was the model for another Phase 2 study of the 
carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (KRd) combination conducted by the Multiple 
Myeloma Research Consortium, and it used a maximum planned dose of 36 mg/m2 twice 
weekly in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (Jakubowiak 2012).   The Phase 3 
ASPIRE study compared the efficacy of KRd  versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone 
in a much larger trial that enrolled 792 RRMM subjects.  ASPIRE showed an improved 
overall response rate and PFS with KRd  therapy and provides a strong incentive to optimize 
the KRd regimen  (Stewart 2015).  
The Phase 1/Phase 2 CHAMPION 1 trial of subjects with relapsed or progressing multiple 
myeloma  who had received 1 to 3 prior regimen s evaluated  the safety and efficacy of 
carfilzomib administered once  weekly at doses higher than the 56 mg/m2 maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) previously established for the twice- weekly administration routine 
(Berenson 2016).   All subjects received carfilzomib (20 mg/m2) on C ycle 1 Day 1 but 
received the cohort -assigned test dose on Cycle 1 D ays 8 and 15.  Testing started at 
45 mg/m2 in the first cohort and was escalated to 56, 70, and  88 mg/m2 in successive cohorts 
until the MTD was determined.  Subjects received dexamethasone 40  mg (IV or oral ly) on 
Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 through 8 and on Days 1, 8, and 15 from Cycle 9 onward.  
No dose- limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) were observed during dose escalation in the cohorts at 45, 
56, or 70 mg/m2.  At a carf ilzomib dose of 88 mg/m2, 2 DLTs were observed during C ycle 1:  
Grade 3 dyspnea ( Days 9 –11) and Grade 3 vomiting (Day 15).  Therefore, the MTD of 
once- weekly carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone was determ ined to be 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib  Page 25 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  70 mg/m2; a total of 104 subjects were treated at 70 mg/m2 carfilzomib dose level on the 
phase 1/2 CHAMPION- 1 study. 
Five treatment- emergent serious adverse events (SAE s) were reported.  One subject had 
2 treatment -emergent SAEs  (Grade 3 increased blood creatinine and Grade 4 hyponatremia), 
1 subject had Grade 3 pneumonia, 1 subject had Grade 3 dyspnea, and 1 subject had G rade 3 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The Grade 3 dyspnea event occurred in a subject 
receiving 88  mg/m2 carfilzomib and was considered to be related to carfilzomib treatment.  
All other S AEs were determined to be unrelated to carfilzomib or dexamethasone treatment.  
The treatment regimen showed promising efficacy with an overall response rate ( ORR ) of 
81% and a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 93% ( Berenson 2016), raising the question of 
whether weekly carfilzomib administered  in combination with other anti myeloma agents 
might provide even greater patient benefit.   
3.3.4 COMBINATIONS OF IMMUNOMODULATORY AGENTS  AND 
PROTEASOME INHIBITOR S  
Nonclinical studies showing that the IMiD  lenalidomide sensitizes multiple myeloma  cells to 
the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib suggested that combination therapy may enhance 
clinical activity  (Mitsiades  2002) .  The treatment paradigm involving proteasome inhibitor, 
immunomodulatory agent, and dexamethasone now forms the core of other treatment approaches aimed at improving either efficacy or tolerability ( Kumar 2010).  The results of 
selected  trials of proteasome inhibitors, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with 
multiple myeloma  are summarized in  Table 1.

CONFIDENTIAL  These studies demonstrated  the efficacy of regimens that combine lenalidomide with 
proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib or carfilzomib ).  The regimens are effective and well  
tolerated both in patients newly with diagnosed multiple myeloma as well as those who have 
relapsed.    
3.4  DOSE RATIONALE  
The dose rationale for this study derives from considerations of carfilzomib, lenalidomide , 
and dexamethasone dose combinations  that are currently in use, as shown in  Table 1.  Dose 
combinations for this study are shown in Table 2.  Prior to protocol amendment 2, 
dose-evaluation cohorts were planned only for RRMM subjects (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3).  
Schemas for enrollment prior to protocol amendment 2 are shown in Appendix E  (Figure 2 
and Figure 3).  With protocol amendment 2, a D ose-evaluation cohort is added for NDMM 
subjects.    
The initial dosing for the proposed weekly KRd combinations (C ohorts 1, 2, and 3) in this 
study reflects a triangulation of the individual components of the studies listed in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3  
Table 1.  
The Dose -evaluation Component of the study begins with carfilzomib 56 mg/m2, 
lenalidomide  25 mg , and dexamethasone 40 mg  in RRMM subjects  
(Cohort 1, Table 2).  As shown in Table 1,  carfilzomib , in combination with dexamethasone, 
has been administered at weekly doses as high as 70  mg/m2/day given once weekly and 
56 mg/m2 given on 2 consecutive days (total weekly exposure of 112 mg/m2).  Carfilzomib 
given as part of a KRd regimen has been administered safely at doses as high as 36  mg/m2 
given on 2 consecutive days each week (total weekly exposure of 72 mg/m2).  Of note, no 
DLTs were identified at this dose in the Phase 1 study ; dose escalation was stopped at  
36 mg/m2 twice -weekly because it was the maximum dose planned in the protocol.  The 
safety information from these trials supports a starting dose for Cohort 1 of carfilzomib 56 mg/m
2, lenalidomide 25 mg, and dexamethasone 40 mg.

CONFIDENTIAL  A 2-step-up KRd regimen will be evaluated in NDMM subjects:  carfilzomib will be given at 
20 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 56 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, then 70 mg/m2 on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 beginning with Cycle 2 (Cohort 4;  Cohort 4  
Table 2).  This regimen was selected by 
the Cohort Safety Review Committee  (CSRC) for D ose-evaluation in NDMM subjects, after 
the occurrence of 2  SAEs in NDMM subjects during Cycle 1 of treatment at Cohort 2 dose-
level  (Arm 1).

3.5 STUDY RATIONALE  
Exploration of therapeutic variati ons aimed at improving  tolerance, patient convenience , 
ef
ficacy, and treatment adherence are importan t considerations for treatment outcomes.  A 
study comparing routes of bortezomib administration showed no loss of efficacy with the 
more convenient subcutaneous (SC) route relative to that seen with the established IV route 
of administration (Moreau 2011).

CONFIDENTIAL  used in the early trials of this agent (Richardson 2009).  A later study comparing 
once- weekly with twice -weekly bortezomib administration demonstrated improved safety, in 
particular a reduction in the rate of peripheral neuropathy, with no apparent e ffect on efficacy 
(Bringhen 2010) . 
The combination of carfilzomib (twice-weekly), lenalidomide, and dexamethasone is a 
highly eff icacious regimen in  RRMM and  NDMM subjects (Stewart  2015;  Jakubowiak 2012; 
Korde 2013).   Of specific note, 23 of 26 subjects who reached nCR/CR achieved negative 
minimal residual disease  (MRD [-]) status in one study ( Jakubowiak 2012), while in another 
trial 27 of 27 subjects who reached nCR/CR achieved MRD[-] status (Korde 2013), further 
emphasizing the efficacy of this combination.  A favorable safety profile and promising 
preliminary ef ficacy for once- weekly carfilzomib in RRMM subjects was  observed in the 
CHAMPION 1 study  (Berenson 2016) .   
This study will explore the safety and tolerability of once- weekly carfilzomib administered 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as part of a KRd regimen  for RRMM and NDMM 
subjects.   Once-weekly carfilzomib  is expected to  improve tolerance, convenience, and 
treatment adherenc
e.  The res
ults will help inform decisions on future efficacy studies 
involving once- weekly carfilzomib administration .

This is an open- label, multicenter, Phase 1b, dose- finding study of carfilzomib administered 
once- weekly in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) in 28- day cycles 
to subjects with multiple myeloma.    STUDY DESIGN  
Subjects may continue to receive study treatment for up to 18 cycles or until 1 or more of the 
following events occurs: 
• Disease progression  
• Allogeneic s tem cell transplant 
• Withdrawal from the study for any reason  
• Study termination by the sponsor 
• Death  
Disease assessments will be conducted at Screening (within 21 days before dosing on 
Cycle  1 Day 1) and then on Day 1, ± 3 days,  of every cycle beginning with Cycle 2.  
Response will be evaluated using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) - 
Uniform Response Criteria ( URC ; Rajkumar,  2011; Appendix C ).   
NDMM s ubjects may interrupt study treatment to proceed to hematopoietic stem cell 
collection, or stem cell collection  and ASCT .  The investigator will communicate transplant 
plans with the clinical study team.  Upon completion of collection, subjects may resume 
study treatment (for up to the total of 18  cycles).  Study treatment interruption for autologous 
hematopoietic stem cell co llection may not exceed 42  days.  Subjects with interruptions 
longer than 42 days may resume therapy on trial only with the written permission of the 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib  Page 32 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  sponsor study medical monitor.  Subjects may interrupt study treatment and proceed to 
ASCT at any time  after Cycle 4.  Subjects who undergo A SCT may resume study treatment 
at any time up to posttransplant day 100, as elected  by the investigator.   
There will be 2 parts in the study.   
The first part is the Dose -evaluation Component during which carfilzomib  combination 
regimens  will be evaluated  (Table 2 and Figure 1).  Approximately 8 dose- limiting toxicity 
evaluable subjects will be enro lled into each opened Dose-evaluation cohort.  Before opening 
Dose -expansion arms , it must be determined that there are not more than 2  dose- limiting 
toxicities in 8  DLT -evaluable subjects at the dose selected for Dose- expansion.  
Dose -expansion arms  may o pen once all safety data for at least  1 cycle  at maximal dose 
carfilzomib  is reviewed by the CSRC.   
The second part is  the Dose-expansion Component.  
Prior to protocol a mendment 2 , dose evaluation was performed on RRMM subjects treated at 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 dosing ( Table 2).  Cohort 2 dosing was selected for expansion with a 
plan for approximately 30 RRMM  subjects and 30 NDMM  subjects to be treated in the 
Dose -expansion Component ( Arms 1 and 2;  Appendix E ; Figure 2 and Figure 3).   
In the first 8 NDMM subjects treated in Dose-expansion Arm 1  at Cohort 2 dosing, 2 SAEs 
were observed during C ycle 1 (Table 2).  Thus, with  protocol amendment 2, Dose -evaluation 
Cohort 4 is added for NDMM subjects ( Table 2 and  Figure 1).  A Dose-expansion arm for 
NDMM subjects may open once all safety data for at least 1  cycle at maximal planned 
carfil zomib dose is reviewed by the CSR C as described in  Section 5.4.   
All subjects will be evaluated for safety at an End of Treatment (EOT) visit, 28 ± 7 days after 
the last study treatment, and with an EOT echocardiogram (ECHO) , done within  28 ± 7 days 
of the last study treatment.  The EOT visit will include a pregnancy test for females of 
childbearing potential (FCBP).  Following the  EOT,  subjects who have not had disease 
progression or allogeneic stem cell transplant will enter Active  Follow-up.  For deta ils 
regarding Active Follow -up, please refer to Section  5.6.

CONFIDENTIAL  Prior to protocol amendment 2, subjects with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple 
myeloma were included only in the Dose -expansion Component 
(Appendix E ; Figure 2, Arm 1 ).  After protocol amendment 2, NDMM subjects will be 
enrolled into a NDMM Dose -evaluation cohort , which may be expanded after safety 
evaluation by the CSRC ( Arm 3, Figure 1).  
Complete eligibility criteria are described in  Section 6. 
5.2 DEFINITION OF DOSE -LIMITING TOXICITY  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) of the KRd regimens  will be evaluated  during Cycle 1  
(Cohorts 1, 2, and 3), or Cycles 1 and 2 (Cohort 4 ), of the Dose -evaluation Component.   
Subjects in the Dose -evaluation Component of the study who do not complete the dose 
evaluation period for reasons unrelated to toxicity will be  considered unevaluable for DLT 
and may be replaced.  DLT  are the toxicities defined below  and attributable to carfilzomib, 
lenalidomide, or dexamethasone. 
5.2.1 NONHEMATOLOGIC DLT  
• ≥ Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, alopecia, 
fatigue lasting < 14 days, increased serum creatinine or electrolyte abnormalities that are 
not clinically significant and require no treatment)  
• ≥ Grade 3 acute kidney injury (creatinine > 3 × baseline or > 4.0 mg/dL) lasting 
> 72 hours 
• ≥ Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea uncontrolled by maximal antiemetic/antidiarrheal therapy  
5.2.2 HEMATOL OGIC DLT  
• Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] < 500/mm3) lasting for >  7 days  
• Febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1000/mm3 with a fever ≥ 38.3ºC) of any duration 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( platelet count < 25,000/mm3) that persists for > 14 days with 
or without platelet transfusion , despite holding treatment 
• Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia ( platelet count < 50,000/mm3) associated with > Grade 1 
bleeding

CONFIDENTIAL  5.3 COHORT SAFETY REVIEW  COMMITTEE  
A CSRC comprised of the lead investigator, selected additional investigators, the sponsor 
study medical monitor, and sponsor’s drug safety representative will review all available 
safety data and make recommendations regarding ongoing enrollment and opening of 
subsequent cohorts during the Dose -evaluation Components.  The CSRC will also select the 
KRd regimen s to be evaluated in the Dose -expansion Components.   
5.4 PART 1:  DOSE -EVALUATION COMPONENT  
Approximately 8 dose- evaluable subjects will be enrolled into each Dose-evaluation cohort 
(Table 2, Figure 1).  Enrollment will be gated such that the first 4 subjects in Cohort 1 wi ll 
complete Cycle 1 and undergo a safety evaluation prior to further enrollment .   
• If ≥ 2 of the first 4 subjects of Cohort 1 experience a DLT, enrollment to that cohort will 
stop and the study will terminate  
• If ≤ 1 of the first 4 subjects experience a DLT, the cohort will recommence enrollment of 
an additional 4 subjects for up to 8 dose- evaluable subjects total  
• Cohort 2 (n = approximately 8) will open  to enrollment 
When both Cohorts 1 and 2 are open for concurrent enrollment, subjects will be assigned to a 
cohort on an alternating basis.  Safety will be evaluated in both cohorts on an ongoing basis. 
• If ≥ 2 of the first 4 subjects experience DLTs or ≥ 3 subjects experience DLTs at any time 
in Cohort 2, enrollment to that cohort will be stopped, and the optional third cohort 
(Cohort 3) may be opened to enrollment of an additional 8 subjects  (approximately) . 
• The CSRC will review all evaluable safety data ( Section  5.3).  If <  3 subjects experience 
a DLT in an opened cohort, that dose may be selected for dose expansion. 
• For NDMM subjects evaluated in Cohort 4, the CSRC will review all safety data from the first 2 cycles and may elect to expand NDMM enrollment 
To be DLT evaluable, subjects must have received all planned doses of carfilzomib , at least 
80% of planned doses of lenalidomide, and at least 75% of planned doses of dexamethasone 
or received at least 1  dose of carfilzomib and experienced a DLT prior to completion of study 
treatment for Cycle 1  (Cohorts 1-3) or Cycle 2 (Cohort 4).  Subjects who withdraw from 
treatment after receiving a dose of carfilzomib but before completing the first 28 -day cycle 
(Cohorts 1-3) or the first two 28-day cycles (Cohort 4) for reasons unrelated to toxicity will 
be considered unevaluable for DLTs.  Subjects who are not DLT- evaluable may be replaced.

Carfilzomib  Page 36 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  The schema for the Dose -evaluation Component of the study for RRMM subjects is 
presented in  Figure 2 (Appendix E ).   
A 2-step-up KRd regimen will be evaluated in NDMM subjects: carfilzomib will be given at 
20 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 56 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, then at 70 mg/m2 on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 beginning with Cycle 2 (Cohort 4;  Cohort 4  
Table 2).  This regimen was selected by 
the CSRC for dose- evaluation in NDMM subjects, after the occurrence of 2  SAEs in NDMM 
subjects during Cycle 1 of treatment at Cohort 2 dose level during the Arm 1 NDMM 
Dose -expansion ( Figure 1). 
5.5 PART 2:  DOSE -EXPANSION COMPONENT  
Per protocol a mendment 2
Enrollme nt of NDMM into Dose-expansion Arm 1 will stop ( Appendix E ; : 
Figure 3).   
NDMM subjects will be  enrolled into Dose- evaluation C ohort 4 ( Figure 1; Table 2).  Arm 1 
subjects  enrolled  prior to protocol amendment 2 w ho are DLT evaluable at C ohort 4 dosing 
will be included in Dose-evaluation Cohort 4 ( Figure 1; Table 2).   
The CSRC will evaluate all safety  data for all NDMM subjects .  Following the DLT rules 
above , the CSRC may elect to open an NDMM Dose -expansion arm , and may enroll an 
additional 30 NDMM subjects ( Section 5.4).    
5.6 ACTIVE  FOLLOW -UP 
Subjects who have terminated or completed study treatment (for reasons other than 
progressive disease, allogeneic stem cell transplant, death, or withdrawal of consent) will 
enter Active  Follow-up for 1  year.  For subjects in Active Follow -up, tumor response and 
disease assessment measurements will be performed every 8  weeks (every 56  ± 4 days).  The 
investigators will make every reasonable effort to keep each patient in active follow -up for 
1 year, or until the subject has progressive disease ( PD), beg ins treatment with any 
antimyeloma medication, has withdrawn consent for further participation, is lost to follow 
up, has died, or the study is closed, whichever is earliest.

CONFIDENTIAL  5.7 ESTIMATED STUDY DURATION AND STUDY CLOSURE  
The total study duration is expected to be a minimum of 60 months.  Approximately 
6 months will be required to enroll subjects in the RRMM  Dose- evaluation Component of the 
study.  Approximately 9 months will be required to enroll subjects in the RRMM  
Dose-expansion Component of the study.  Subjects will be followed for up to 17 months in 
order to complete primary safety and efficacy evaluations with up to an additional 12 months 
of Active Follow-up.  
It will take up to approximately 12 months to enroll NDMM subjec ts into Dose- evaluation 
Cohort 4, review the safety data, and e nroll NDMM subjects into  the NDMM  
Dose -expansion Arm 3 .  Subjects will be followed for up to 17 months on treatment (with an 
allowed interruption of up to 4.5 months for ASCT), and for 12 months for  Active Follow up. 
Based on these assumptions, it is estimated that the final analysis will occur approximately 60 months after the first subject is enrolled.  
The end of study will occur when the last subject leaves A ctive Follow-up. 
5.8 MINIMIZING BIAS  
5.8.1 RANDOMIZATION 
This is not a randomized study.  
Subjects in the RRMM Dose -evaluation Component will be assigned to the open cohort at 
time of enrollment; when/if Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 are both open to enrollment, enrollment will alternate between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 until Cohort 1 is filled.   
5.8.2 BLINDING  
This is an open- label study ; there is no blinding.

A signed and dated informed consent form (ICF)  will be o btained before any study- specific 
tests may be performed.  Evaluations obtained as part of routine medical care and performed 
during the screening period may be used in place of the study-specific evaluations, provided 
they meet the time windows described below.  It is recommended that s tudy- specific tests 
unrelated to subject eligibility (including a bone marrow aspirate) be done only after 
screening tests confirm subject eligibility for the study.  Subjects will acknowledge and agree 
to the possible use of this information for the study by giving informed consent.   SUBJECT SCREENING  
All subjects who sign consent will be assigned a unique study number.  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject.   
The screening period for a particular subject commences at the point at which the subject signs the ICF, and must be completed within 21 days  before dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1.

Carfilzomib will be administered onceweekly over 30 minutes (approximate)  followed by a 
flush (see IPIM for details) on Days 1 (± 2), 8 (± 2), and 15 (± 2) of each cycl e.  The dose 
can be calculated using the subject’s actual body surface area (BSA) at baseline; however, 
dosing adjustments for subsequent actual BSA determinations is allowed per institutional 
guidelines.  Subjects with a BSA > 2.2 m2 will receive a dose based upon a 2.2 m2 BSA.  
Dose adjustments must be made for weight gains/losses of ≥ 20% of baseline body weight.  Mechanical infusion pumps are recommended but gravity-dependent infusions are permitted 
if the 30-minute infusion duration can be reliably maintained.  Carfilzomib  
Carfilzomib will be administered at 20  mg/m2 on Cycle 1  Day 1  and given once weekly .

Carfilzomib infusion  must occur at a facility capable of  managing hypersensitivity reactions.  
Subjects will remain at the investigational site under observation for at least 1 hour following 
each infusion of carfilzomib in Cycle 1. 
9.2.1.2 
Lenalidomide will be taken once- daily by mouth  with or without food.  Lenalidomide 
capsules should be swallowed whole with water.  The capsules should not be opened, broken, 
or chewed.   Subjects will be instructed to take the lenalidomide dose at approximately the 
same time every day.  If a planned administration of lenalidomide is missed, it should be 
taken as soon as possible within the same calendar day with a return to schedule the 
following day.  If a calendar day of dosing is missed, subjects should not make up doses, but 
should resume the dosing regimen on schedule with the next course.  Missed doses must be reported.  Lenalidomide  
For FCBP, n onpregnant state must be documented prior to the first dose of lenalidomide, 
every week for the first cycle, prior to the start of each subsequent cycle, and at EOT .   
Subjects must be advised to not donate blood during treatment with lenalidomide and for 1 month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a 
pregnant female subject whose fetus must not be exposed to lenalidomide. 
9.2.1.3 
Dexamethasone will be taken by mouth or by IV infusion once- daily  on Days 1 (± 2), 8 (± 2),

Treatment guidelines for specific hematologic toxicities are outlined in Section 9.2.2.1 and 
nonhematologic toxicities in Section 9.2.2.2.  In addition to dose reductions, administration 
of carfilzomib and/or lenalidomide may  be held temporarily in the event of a 
treatment -related toxicity at the investigator’s discretion.  When administration of 
carfilzomib and/or lenalidomide is held , the reason must be documented in the case report 
form (CRF ), and the medical monitor must be notified within 2  business days of the 
scheduled dose ( Section  9.1).  
If either the lenalidom ide or carfilzomib dose level is reduced during a given  cycle, the 
reduced dose level will be continued for the next cycle.  If the reduced dose level is tolerated 
for a complete cycle, the subject may, at the investigator’s discretion, resume the dose level 
prior to the reduction at the start of the subsequent cycle.

Schedule of Assessments  (STUDY PROCEDURES  
Appendix A ).  On -study tests and observations are summarized 
below. 
10.1 STUDY- SPECIFIC PROCEDURES  
10.1.1  BASELINE PROCEDURES  
To be completed prior to initiation of therapy:  
• Skeletal s urvey (all subjects) ( Section  10.1.4.3)  
• Beta-2 microglobulin ( Section 10.1.4.1)  
• Plasmacytoma evaluation (if clinically indicated) ( Section 10.1.4.3)  
• Bone m arrow aspirate and biop sy (all subjects,  Section  10.1.4.2)  
10.1.2  VITAL SIGNS  
Vital signs will include  pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature and will be 
assessed at Screening , prior to and after  administration of carfilzomib  on treatment days, and 
at EOT .  Resting b lood pressure readings will be taken before administration of carfilzomib  
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.  Pre -carfilzomib blo od pressure may be assessed either 
before or after dexamethasone administration, and for a given patient should be done 
consistently before dexamethasone, or consistently after dexamethasone.  The time of pre-
carfilzomib dosing blood pressure assessment wi ll be recorded .  The time of Day 1, 8, and 
15 dexamethasone administration will also be recorded (per report by patient if self -
administered).  During Cycles 1 through 6, 12, and 18, pre-carfilzomib blood pressure 
readings will be taken in triplicate.   In addition to the predosing blood pressure assessments, 
postdosing resting blood pressure readings will be taken in triplicate on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 60 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  Cycles 1 through 6, 12, and 18.  Postdosing blood pressure will be assessed from  10 to 
60 minutes after completion of carfilzomib administration.  
The subject should be in a supine position in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes 
before blood pressure assessments are conducted.  If unable to be in a supine position, the 
subject should be in the most recumbent position possible.  The position selected for a 
subject should be the same that is uses throughout the study and documented on the vital sign 
CRF.  The arm should be supported at the level of the heart.  Every effort should be made to 
use the same instrument in measuring a subject’s blood pressure throughout the study.  When 
blood pressure measurements are taken in triplicate, readings should be taken a minute or 
more apart.  
10.1.3  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
A physical exam ination  will be performed during Screening , on Day 1 of C ycles 2 
through 18, and at the EOT .  Physical exam will include:   
• ECOG PS  
• Examination of cardiovascular and respiratory systems  
• Weight   
• BSA  (at Screening and on Day 1 of C ycles 2 –18 only) 
• Height  (at Screening  only) 
Abnormal physical exam ination  findings during Screening  will be captured as medical 
history.  Abnormal physical examination findings observed after signing of the informed consent will be recorded as AEs.   
10.1.4  DISEASE ASSESSMENTS  
10.1.4.1 
Labora tory assessments of disease status will be performed at  Screening (within 21 days 
before dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1); at Day  1 (± 3 days ) of Cycle 2 and each cycle thereafter ; at 
the EOT ; and every 8  weeks  (every 56 ± 4 days ) during Active Follow-up. Laboratory Evaluations of Disease Status

Carfilzomib   Page 61 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  Disease assessments at Screening  (within 21 days before dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1) or 
baseline,  include the following: 
• Serum protein electrophoresis ( SPEP) with immunofixation  
• Urine protein electrophoresis ( UPEP ; 24-hour assessment, no substitute method is 
acceptable)  with  immunofixation  
• SFLC  
• Quantitative immunoglobulins  
• Beta-2 microglobulin  
Disease assessments at Day 1 (± 3 days) of Cycle 2 and each cycle thereafter , at the EOT , 
and during Active Follow-up include the following: 
• Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with  immunofixation  
• UPEP with immunofixation  
• SFLC  
• Quantitative immunoglobulins  
SPEP with immunofixation, UPEP  with immunofixation , beta-2 microglobulin, SFLC, and 
quantitative immunoglobulin analyses will be performed at the local laboratory.  
10.1.4.2 
A bone marrow aspirate is required at baseline, on Cycle 8 Day  1 (±  3 day s), and to confirm 
a CR  or sCR .  An optional
 bone marrow aspirate may also be done upon progression of 
disease in subject s who consent to optional genomic biomarker studies.  Details of aspirate 
sampli
ng and shipment are described in the central laboratory manual. Bone Marrow Aspirate Assessments of Disease Status  
At baseline, bone marrow aspirate will be evaluated by the local pathology lab to determine 
percen t plasma cell involvement.  For subjects whose aspirate is unobtainable, a bone 
marrow core biopsy should be obtained for quantification of percent plasma cell involvement.  Bone marrow aspirate or biopsy samples (taken as part of standard of care) 
within 45 days prior to Cycle 1 Day  1 may be used to quantify percent plasma cell 
involvement. 
Baseline bone marrow aspirate samples are also sent to the central lab oratories for 
fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ; Section  10.2.3) and for Next Generation Sequencing 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 62 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  (NGS) to allow MRD  analysis  (Section  10.2.4) ; also referred to herein as “MRD”).  Subject s 
who consent to  optional genomic biomarker evaluation will have the baseline genomic 
biomarker analyses performed on aspirate samples remaining a fter central FISH testing of 
baseline aspirate.  
Bone marrow aspirate will be collected for central MRD analysis on Cycle 8 Day  1 for all 
subjects regardless of response status (±  2 days; see  Section  10.2.4) . 
Subjects with laboratory evidence of CR require confirmatory bone marrow aspirate 
evaluation , by the central study laboratory, for MRD (Section  10.2.4) , in addition to local 
bone marrow assessment for evaluation of CR per IMWG- URC ( Appendix C ).  
Consenting subjects with PD may have a bone marrow aspirate done for optional genomic 
biomarker studies ( Section  10.2.5).  
In instances where sample availability is limited, samples for disease assessments take priority over those for correlati ve testing  as specified in the laboratory manual . 
10.1.4.3 
All subjects will have a baseline skeletal survey.  Repeat skeletal survey is recommended as 
clinically indicated.  Imaging Assessments of Disease Status  
Subjects  with physical exam finding s suggestive of pl asmacytoma should undergo baseline 
imaging with computed tomography [CT] scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or 
positron emission tomography/CT [PET/CT]. 
Repeat p lasmacytoma imaging is required o nly to confirm a response of PR or better, to 
confirm PD,  or if clinically indicated .  The same imaging technique should be employed for 
each measurement . 
For study purposes, a plasmacytoma is considered measurable if the longest diameter is at 
least 1  cm and the product of the greatest orthogonal cross- diameter s is at least 1  cm2.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.5  MYELOMA  RESPONSE ASSESSMENT  
Response will be determined by the investigator based on the disease assessments described 
above and the IMWG- URC (see definitions in  Appendix C ).  Myeloma response laboratory 
studies will be drawn at the beginning of each cycle before treatment .  The following 
confirmatory assessments are required for all response categories ( stringent complete 
response [ sCR], CR, VGPR, and PR ) and progressive disease: 
• All laboratory -based progressive disease and all responses require 2 consecutive 
assessments made at any time before initiation of any new (ie, off protocol) therapy.   
Confirmatory lab samples should be separa ted by at least 1 calendar day  
• Progressive disease by non laboratory- based assessment (ie, plasmacytoma or skeletal 
lesion) does not require confirmatory report 
• All response categories also require no evidence of progression including new bone 
lesions, if radiog raphic studies a re performed  
• Confirmation of CR or sCR requires local pathology review of a bone marrow biopsy or 
aspirate (a repeat confirmatory bone marrow sample is not required) 
• Extramedullary plasmacytoma evaluation is required to confirm PR, CR, or sCR  (if 
present at baseline; Rajkumar, 2011) 
10.1.6  CLINICAL LABORATORY TESTS  
Clinical laboratory assessments will include the following:  
• Hematology:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell ( WBC ) with complete 
differential (total neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), RBCs, platelet count

nitrogen ( BUN), creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, AST, ALT, total 
protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogen ase (LDH )  
• Abbreviated chemistry panel:  sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose  
• Coagulation tests:  prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and  
international normalized ratio  
Hematology and serum chemistry (full or abbreviated) will be performed at Screening , on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, and at EOT .  On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle, from Cycle  2 
onwards, an abbreviated serum chemistry panel may be performed.   C oagulation will be 
performed at baseline and at  EOT.  For screening laboratory samples, historical panel may be 
used if within 21 days prior to dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Thereafter, hematology samples

CONFIDENTIAL  may be obtained anytime within the 24 hours prior to the carfilzomib administration , and full 
or abbreviated chemistry panels may be performed up t o 72 hours prior to carfilzomib 
administration .  
10.1.7  ELECTROCARDIOGRAM  
Twelve- lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) including corrected QT interval (QTc; representing 
the corrected duration of ventricular electrical activity) will be performed locally.  These will 
be required in all subjects at Screening  only.  Additional ECG assessment is only required if 
clinically indicated  
10.1.8  ECHOCARDIOGRAM  
A 2-D transthoracic ECHO  to assess LVEF will be performed in all subjects at Screening  and 
at EOT .  During the  Dose -evaluation Component, an ECHO is also required at Cycle 2 
Day 15, ± 7 days .  Additional ECHO assessment is only required for subjects who develop 
clinically significant congestive heart failure.   
If transthoracic ECH O is not available, multigated acquisition (MUGA) will be acceptable 
for LVEF evaluation. 
10.1.9  SUBJECT  CONVENIENCE AND SATISFACTION 
Subject  convenience and satisfaction will be assessed in all subject s by questionnaire at 
Cycle  3 Day 1 and Cycle 18 Day 1 (see Appendix D ).  The questionnaire should be 
administered prior to treatment with carfilzomib .  
10.2 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
It is recommended that s amples for correlative studies be collected only after screening 
laboratories confirm study eligibility for the subject. 
10.2.1  PHARMACOKINETIC M EASUREMENTS  
For both the Dose -evaluation and the Dose -expansion Components, blood samples will be 
collected from all subjects  on Day 8 of Cycle 1 for determination of plasma concentrations 
of carfilzomib .

• 15 minutes  (± 5 minutes) after the end of carfilzomib infusion  
• 60 minutes  (± 5 minutes) after the end of carfilzomib infusion 
The actual time of PK sample collection will be recorded.  Samples should be collected 
within a ± 5 minute time window around the nominal time points (except for the time point 
immediately prior to the end of carfilzomib infusion in which the PK collection needs to 
occur prior to end of infusion) .  Collecting PK samples at times other than nominal time 
points will not constitute a  protocol deviation.  These samples will be assessed at a central 
laboratory.  Directions for collection, processing, and shipping of PK blood samples are provided in the central laboratory manual .   
10.2.2  PHARMACODYNAMIC  MEASUREMENTS  
For pharmacodynamic measurements, whole blood will be collected from the subjects on the following schedule:

Analysis of genetics , gene expression, and cell surface biomarkers that may be predictive of  
response and resistance to treatment with proteasome inhibitors will be performed .  
Exploratory studies will be conducted on all subject s who consent to optional genomic 
biomarker analysis.  These analyses will be performed on bone marrow aspirate at baseline  
(the remaining portion of the bone marrow aspirate sample left after the amount required for 
FISH analysis has been collected at baseline ), as well as a sample of blood and saliva also 
collected at baseline.  At disease progression, an additional bone marrow sample for 
biomarker analysis may be collected from all subject s who consent. 
Whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), whole transcriptome sequencing  (RNA -Seq), and/or other methods of nucleic acid and protein quantification wil l 
be conducted on isolated tumor (CD138+) cells from bone marrow samples taken at baseline and disease progression .  In addition, WGS or WES will be performed on a normal tissue 
sample (eg, CD3+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood or saliva ) to distinguish germ line 
mutations from somatic mutations in tumor cell samples.

11.1 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJEC TS FROM  TREATMENT STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N 
Subjects may withdraw from study treatment at any time.   Reasons for discontinuation 
include: 
• Adverse event  
• Allogeneic stem cell  transplant  
• Pregnancy  
• Death  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Noncompliance  
• Withdrawal by  subject 
• Study terminated by the sponsor 
• Physician decision  
• Progression of disease 
• Other  
The primary reason for treatment discontinuation will be documented in the eCRF.  
Investigators will be instructed to interview subjects to obtain the most accurate reason for 
study treatment discontinuation while respecting the privacy of the subject.  
If the reason for treatment discontinuation is the occurrence of an AE, the subject will be 
followed by the investigator until such event(s) resolve, stabilize, and, according to the 
investigator’s judgment, there is no need of further follow-up.  
Treatment discontinuation due to progression should be recorded as “Disease Progression.”  
If the Disease Progression meets any of the serious criteria, as outlined in Section  12.2.1.4, 
then it should also be recorded as a serious adverse event (SAE ) in the AE eCRF.  
Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours if a subject is withdrawn from 
treatment.  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 68 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  All subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from study treatment will be encouraged to 
complete all relevant safety assessments and continue in the A ctive  Follow-up period.  
11.2 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS FROM STUDY 
Reasons for complete withdrawal from the study (treatment and all follow -up) before 
documentation of subject death include: 
• Withdrawal of consent by subject for all study procedures 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Sponsor decision  
The reason for complete withdrawal from study will be documented in the e CRF.  
11.3 STUDY TERMINATION 
The sponsor has the right to terminate this study or a study site from participating in a study 
at any time.   Reasons for study termination may include: 
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other carfilzomib studies indicates a potential  
health hazard to subjects 
• Subje ct enrollment is unsatisfactory  
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
• Investigator does not adhere to the protocol or applicable regulatory requirements in 
conducting the study 
12 
12.1 DEFINITION OF SAFETY EVENTS  SAFETY DATA COLLECTI ON, RECORDING, AND R EPORTING  
12.1.1  ADVERSE EVENTS  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial  subject.  The event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that any AEs observed by the investigator or reported by the subject 
are recorded in the subject’s medical record.   
The definition of AEs includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  Worsening 
indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 69 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  expected, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome than expected.  A 
pre-existing condition that has not worsened more than anticipated (ie, more than usual 
fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an AE.   
For situations when an AE or SAE is due to multiple myeloma, report all known signs and symptoms.  Death due to disease progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be 
reported as the primary tumor type (eg, multiple myeloma).  
Note:  The term “ disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease- related 
event or AE.   The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed 
from treatment due to an AE.  In the event a subject, or subject’s legally a cceptable 
representative requests to withdraw from protocol-required therapies or the study due to an AE, refer to Section 11 for additional instructions on the procedures recommended for safe 
withdrawal from protocol-required therapies or the study.   
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 70 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  12.1.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
A serious adverse event is defined as an AE that meets at least 1 of the following serious 
criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (pl aces the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event 
An AE would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event necessitated an 
admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the 
serious criteria, the event could be classified as a SAE under the criterion of “other medically 
important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, 
convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug induced liver injury, or events that neces sitate an 
emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.   
12.2 SAFETY EVENT REPORTI NG PROCEDURES  
12.2.1  ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.2.1.1 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs observed by the investigator or 
reported by the subject that occur after signing the informed consent form through 30 days 
after receiv ing the last dose of study drugs are reported using the Event CRF.   Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
If initiation of new anticancer therapy occurs within 30 days following the last dose of study drugs , the date of new anticancer therapy will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  In 
addition, the investigator should report any AEs that may occur after this time period which are assessed to have a reaso nable possibility of being associated with study drug. 
For subjects who complete the EOT visit less than 30 days following the last dose of study drug, a follow-up of ongoing AEs should be attempted by telephone and documented in the 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 71 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  subject’s source file.   AEs continuing at 30 days after the last dose of study treatment should 
have a comment in the source file by the investigator that the event has stabilized or is not 
expected to improve. 
The investigator must assign the following AE attributes: 
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), 
• Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol), 
• Assessment of relatedness to carfilzomib and/or other protocol- required therapies  
• Action taken. 
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE).  The grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix F .   
The investigator must assess whether the AE is possibly related to carfilzomib and/or other 
protocol- required therapies .  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by  
carfilzomib and/or other protocol- required therapies ?   
In the event of a possible drug-related AE, the investigator should to the best of his/her 
ability assess its relationship to each of the study drugs:  carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and/or 
dexamethasone.  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change 
from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical 
significance (based on the investigator's ju dgment) are not to be recorded as AEs.  However, 
laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered AEs.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to 
be recorded as the AE.  
The In vestigator is expected to follow reported AEs until stabilization or reversibility.  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 72 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  12.2.1.2 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAEs observed by the investigator or 
reported by the subject that occ ur after  through 30 days after the last day of the study drug 
are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen.  All SAEs must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via 
the Event CR F.   Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the SAE, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic SAE Contingency Report Form 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  See Appendix G for a sample of the SAE Worksheet /electronic SAE Contingency Report Form.  For EDC studies where 
the first notification of a SAE is reported to Amgen via the e lectronic SAE Contingency 
Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.  
The investigator must assess whether the SAE is possibly related to carfilzomib  and/or other 
protocol-required therapies.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by carfilzomib 
and/or other protocol- required therapies?  Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to 
support a relationship between investigational product and the event. 
The investigator is expected to follow reported SAEs until stabilization or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported SAE must be submitted to Amgen.  All 
new information for SAEs must be sent to Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of 
the new information.  If specifically requested, the investigator may need to provide 
additional follow-up information, such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts 
from the medical records. Information provided about the SAE must be consistent with that 
recor ded on the Event CRF. 
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol- required therapies because of a SAE, 
this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 73 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  Amgen will report SAEs and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required 
to regulato ry authorities, investigators/institutions, and Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice.  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of SAEs occurring at the site and other 
AE reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and 
procedures. 
12.2.1.3 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for SAEs following the protocol-required 
reporting period or after end of study.  However, these SAEs can be reported to Amgen.  In 
some countries (eg, European Union [EU] member states), investigators are required to 
report  SAEs that they become aware of after end of study.  If SAEs are reported, the 
investigator is to report them to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required Reporting 
Period  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol-required report ing period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited 
reporting.  
12.2.1.4 
Disease progression w ill be documented in an eCRF intended to capture PD information and 
will be analyzed as a study endpoint.  Signs and symptoms related to disease progression 
(eg, pathologic fracture in a subject with progressive multiple myeloma) should be reported 
in the appropriate CRF as an AE or as an SAE (if the event in question meets the criteria for 
seriousness).  Verbatim terms such as “disease progression,” “progressive disease,” etc. 
should not be reported as AEs or SAEs unless the investigator considers the progression to be 
atypical, accelerated, or caused by the study drug.  Similarly deaths occurring as a result of 
disease progression should be reported on the eCRF intended to capture death information 
and should not be reported as SAEs. Serious Adverse Events That are not to be Reported by the Sponsors to 
Regulatory Agencies in an Expedited Manner

CONFIDENTIAL  12.3 PREGNANCY AND LACTATION REPORTING  
If a female subject becomes pregnant, or a male subject fathers a child, while the subject is 
taking carfilzomib report the pregnancy to Amgen Global Patient Safety as specified below. 
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
report pregnancies that occur in female subjects 30 days after the last study drug 
administration, and in a male subject’s spouse or partner while enrolled in this clinical study 
through 90 days following the last study drug administration. 
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the Pregnancy 
Notification Worksheet ( Appendix H ) Amgen Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the 
investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should attempt to 
obtain information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant.  Newborns should be 
followed for a minimum of 12 weeks.    
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immedia te classification as a SAE 
(eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or there 
is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the investigator will report the event as a SAE.  
If a female breastfeeds while taking protocol -required therapies report the lactation case to 
Amgen as specified below.  
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation Notification 
Worksheet ( Appendix H ).   
Amgen Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the investigator regarding additional 
informat ion that may be requested.

The final analysis will be based upon subject data collected through discontinuation of the 
final subject from study participation or until study discontinuation by the sponsor , 
whichever occurs first.  All efficacy and safety analyses will be based upon t he Safety 
Population, defined as subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study drug .  All summaries will be 
presented by the assigned dose cohort level , by RRMM and NDMM population, as well as 
for the overall S afety Population.  In addition, response data (O RR, complete response rate 
[CRR ], PFS, DOR) may also be analyzed based on the Response- evaluable Population, 
defined as subjects who are included in the S afety Population, have a baseline disease 
assessment and at least 1 post baseline disease assessment, o r dropped out due to AE prior to 
the first post baseline disease assessment.  STATISTICS

the study will be summarized by the assigned dose cohort and for all subjects.  Demographic 
and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, race, weight, number of prior therapies, and 
baseline ECOG PS (Appendix B ), will be summarized using  means, standard deviations, 
medians, and ranges for continuous variables, and proportions for categorical variables.

committee will not be employed for this study.  
13.4 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
A data monitoring committee will not be employed for this study.  
13.5 STATISTICAL METHODS  
13.5.1  EFFICACY ANALYSES  
The primary analysis of efficacy will be based on the Safety Population.  Additionally, 
response data (ORR, CRR, PFS, and DOR ) may also be analyzed based on the 
Response-e valuable Population.  Response assessment data, PFS, and DOR will be listed for 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 77 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  all subjects by dose cohort level.   Point estimates for ORR and CRR along with their exact 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  Summary statistics for DOR and PFS 
will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  The follow- up time for PFS will be 
summarized by reverse Kaplan -Meier method (Schemper  1996 ). 
13.5.2  SAFETY ANALYSIS  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs, chang es from baseline in laboratory test 
results, including immunoglobulin levels, and vital signs, and the extent and duration of 
exposure to stud
y drugs.  All treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by MedDRA 
preferred term, NCI -CTCAE ( version 4.03) toxicit y grade, and investigator assessment of 
causality.  In addition, all SAEs and DLTs, including deaths, will be listed separately.  Extent 
of exposure to the study treatment will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Laboratory parameters will be summ arized using des criptive statistics and by postdose shifts 
relative to baseline .  Vital signs will also be summarized descriptively for each scheduled 
protocol time point.    
13.5.3  PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES  
Actual collection times will be recorded and used in the analysis.  Individual and mean 
plasma concentration versus time data will be tabulated and plotted by dose level.  The PK parameter estimates for carfilzomib will be summarized, including total plasma exposure 
(expressed as area under the curve [ AUC ]), maximum plasma concentration (C
max), time to 
maximum plasma concentration (T max), total plasma clearance, and plasma terminal half -life 
(as appropriate for data collected).  Estimates for these parameters will be tabulated and 
summarized (ie, mean, standard deviation). 
Unless otherwise specified, the PK parameter will be estimated based on noncompartmental 
methods.  The
se estimates will be summarized descriptively by dose cohort  and population.  
Exploratory analyses may be performed to evaluate the relatio nship between the estimated 
PK parameters and selected safety, biomarker
, or clinical effect endpoints.  
In addition to noncompartmental PK analysis, the population modeling program may be used 
to fit a nonlinear mixed effects model to estimate PK parameter s including clearance and

CONFIDENTIAL  volume of distribution, the inter- and intra-subject variability and the population variability in 
the parameter estimates.  The PK concentrations obtained from subjects in the 
Dose -expansion portion, along with results from the Dose-evaluation Component of the 
study and other carfilzomib studies will be used in the development of a structural model.  The best model will be evaluated by goodness of fit statistics and reduction in the objective 
function and posterior predictive checks.  Subject characteristics such as age, gender, body 
weight, BSA, and race will be included in the model to identify potential covariates affecting 
PK of carfilzomib.  Results from the population PK modeling will be reported separately. 
13.5.4  EXPLORATORY ANALYSES  
Exploratory analyses of MRD[-] rate, PDn, and genomic biomarkers may be conducted.  Point estimates for MRD[ -] rate along with exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated.   MRD measurements will be correlated with ORR, CRR, PFS, and other clinical 
variables to explore the relationship of MRD to disease response and progression. 
PDn will be determined from whole blood. 
For genomic biomarker analyses , WGS , WES, RNA- Seq, and/or other forms of nucleic acid 
and protein data will be analyzed to characterize whether drug response is related to 
alterations in genes regulated by or involved in activation of nuclear factor kappa light chain 
enhancer of activated B cells ( NF-Kappa B) transcription factors as well as in genes in volved 
in immunoglobulin production and protein homeostasis.  Immunoglobulin levels in tumor cells will be quantified by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and/or other protein 
quantification methods.  The genomic data as a whole will also be used to derive new hypotheses about mechanisms of drug response, resistance, and safety. 
Results from the subject  convenience and satisfaction questionnaire will be summarized 
descriptively.  
13.6 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA  
Missing data for partial dates for AEs or concomitant medication may be imputed according 
to prespecified, conservative imputation rules.  Details of missing data handling and 
imputation rules will be specified in the statistical analysis plan.

Progression and survival data will be collected for all subjects on study.  For subjects who 
discontinue without having experienced progression or death, progression will be censored at 
the time of the last on -study disease assessment demonstrating lack of progression.  Details 
of censoring rules will be specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
13.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
Sample sizes are determined to provide preli minary information on safety, clinical activity, 
PDn, and PK.  
For t
he Dose -evaluat ion Component of the study, it is anticipated that approximately 
8 subjects will be enrolled in each dose cohort with 16 subjects total, should both cohorts be 
fully enrolled.  Assuming beta ( 0.5, 0.5) prior distribution for the DLT rate, 95% credible
 
intervals for the DLT rate and the posterior probability of DLT rate being larger than 0.33 for each toxic
ity scenario are provided in Table 12.  
For example, when 3 out of 8 subjects have 
DLTs , the poste
rior probability of t he DLT rate being > 0.33 is 0.62.

With combined number of subjects in both dose finding and expansion components, 
38 RRMM subjects  and 38 NDMM subjects will allow  an approximately 86% probability to 
detect an occurrence of an AE with 5% incidence rate.   
13.8 INTERIM ANALYSIS  
No formal interim analyses with the purpose of stopping the study early for efficacy or 
futility  will be conducted for this study.  However, the following nonbinding boundaries are  
calculated to provide more information about the distribution of ORR for subjects with 
relapsed disease.  
For subjects with relapsed disease, under the null hypothesis of ORR ≤ 55%, the alternative 
hypothesis of ORR ≥ 75%, and the beta (0.65, 0.35) prior distribution for the true ORR , the 
boundaries for number of subjects with overall responses based on Bayesian predictive 
probability ( Lee 2008)  are listed below in  Table 13 .

that provide the prospective subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate, and that minimize the 
possibility of coercion or undue influence.  The information tha t is given to the subject or the 
representative shall be in a language understandable to the subject or representative.  
The sponsor or its designated representative will provide the investigator with a sample 
consent form.  Local and/or institutional requirements may require disclosure of additional information in the ICF.  Any changes to the consent form must be submitted to the sponsor or 
its designated representative for acceptance, prior to submission to the IRB/IEC.  
The IRB/IEC will review the consent  form for approval.  A copy of the approved form must 
be submitted to the sponsor or its designated representative for its acceptance prior to 
initiation of the study.  Before implementing any study procedure on a particular subject, 
informed consent shall be documented in such subject ’s case histories and by the use of a 
written consent form approved by the sponsor and the IRB/IEC and signed and dated by the 
subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative at the time of c onsent.  A copy of 
the signed informed consent will be given to the subject or subject’s legally authorized 
representative.  The original signed consent must be maintained by the i nvestigator and 
available for inspection by the sponsor, its designated repr esentative, or regulatory authority 
at any time.  
14.4 DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA, SOURCE DOCUMENTS, AND 
STUDY RECORDS  
The study will be carried out in keeping with applicable local laws and regulations.  
This may include an inspection by sponsor representativ es/designees, and/or regulatory 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 83 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  authority representatives at any time.  The investigator/institution must agree to the 
inspection of study- related records by the regulatory authority/ sponsor 
representatives/designees, and must allow direct access to source documents to the regulatory authority/sponsor representatives/ designees/IRB/IEC.  The investigator must allocate time 
(investigator and study staff) to discuss findings and relevant issues with the regulatory 
authority/sponsor representatives.  
14.5 DATA COLLE CTION AND HANDLING  
As part of the responsibilities assumed by participating in the study, the investigator agrees to 
maintain adequate case histories for the subjects treated as part of the rese arch under this 
protocol.  The i nvestigator agrees to maintain  accurate eCRFs  and source documentation as 
part of the case histories.  These source documents may include subject diaries, laboratory 
reports, and other documents.  The sponsor will supply the eCRF, which will be completed in 
English. 
Data collection will involve the use of the EDC system, to which only authorized personnel 
will have access.  
The investigator or designee must enter all results collected during the clinical study into 
eCRFs.  Guidelines for completion of eCRFs will be reviewed with study  site personnel at 
the site initiation visits.  Investigators are responsible for approval of the entered/corrected 
data.  Detailed instructions may be found in the other study- specific documents . 
All entries made on the eCRF , must be verifiable against so urce documents.  In addition to 
periodic monitoring occurring within the system by study monitors, programmatic edit 
checks and data listings will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and 
adherence to study protocol.  As a result of this monitoring and these checks, queries may be 
electronically issued to the clinical study sites and electronically resolved by those sites.  
All data collected in the context of this study will be stored and evaluated per regulatory requirements and applicable g uidance for electronic records.  Also, data will be stored and 
evaluated in such a way as to assure subject confidentiality in accordance with the legal and 
regulatory requirements applying to protected health information.  Study records (eg,  copies 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 84 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  of eCR Fs, regulatory documents) will be retained at the study site, along with adequate 
source documentation.  The study file and all source data should be retained for the time 
period required by applicable regulatory requirements and will not be destroyed unti l written 
notification is given by the sponsor or designee for destruction. 
14.6 CONFIDENTIALITY  
All records identifying the subject  will be kept confidential and, in accordance with  the 
applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. 
Subject  names will not be supplied to the sponsor.  Only the subject number will be recorded 
on the case report form (CRF).  If the subject name appears on any other document 
(eg, pathologist report) or study materials (eg, biopsy tissue slides), then that information 
must be redacted before a copy of the document is supplied to the sponsor.  Study data stored 
on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws  and regulations.  
Subject s will be informed in writing that representatives of the sponsor, IRB/IEC, or 
regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, 
and that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest 
confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws and regulations. 
If the results of the study are published, the subject ’s identity will remain confidential.  
The investigator will maintain a list to enable subject s’ records to be identified  in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations and according to the terms and agreed upon in such 
subjects’ signed consent forms. 
14.7 PUBLICATION POLICY 
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen may facilitate the formation of a 
publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen staff, the 
governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter.  The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and  to 
collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication Charter.  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and Amgen staff) does not 
guarantee authorship.  The criteria described below are to be met for every pu blication.  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib   Page 85 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of 
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Recommendations for the Conduct 
of Reporting, Editing, and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which states: 
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the article 
or revising it critically for important intellectu al content; (3) final approval of the version 
to be published and (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in 
ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are 
appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. 
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be lis ted. 
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) based on 
this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial Agreement among the 
institution, investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, and timing of, Amgen’s 
review of publications.

sCR • Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and
• Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas   
• < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow and 
and
• Normal SFLC ratio   
and
• Absence of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow by 
immunohistochemistry or 2 - to 4- color flow cytometry    
CR • Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and

CONFIDENTIAL  Summary of International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria 
(IMWG -URC) (cont’d) 
PD • Increase of 25% from lowest response value in any of the following: 
o Serum M -component (absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL) 
o Urine M -component (absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg per 
24 hours) and/or  
o Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein 
levels:  the difference between involved and  uninvolved FLC 
levels (absolute increase must be >10  mg/dL)  and/or  
• Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacytomas or definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or 
soft tissue plasmacytomas  
• Development of hypercalcemia (corrected s erum calcium 
> 11.5 mg/dL or 2.875 mmol/L) attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder 
CR = complete response; sCR = stringent complete response; FLC = serum free light chain; PD  = progressive 
disease; PR = partial response; SFLC = serum free light chain; VGPR = very good partial response.  
 
All response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, PR, PD) require 2 consecutive assessments made 
at any time before the institution of any new therapy, as well as no known evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed.  Radiographic 
studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements.  Bone marrow, 
plasmacytoma, and skeletal survey assessments are not required to be confirmed by repeat 
testing. SD requires a duration of ≥ 6 weeks. 
For sCR:  presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the kappa lambda ( κ/λ) ratio.  An 
abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ > 4:1 or < 1:2. An abnormal 
kappa lambda ratio by immunohistochemistry and/or immunof luorescence requires a 
minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis.  For CR:  A normal SFLC kappa lambda ratio is 
0.26 to 1.65. 
“Measurable” disease is defined by at least one of SPEP ≥ 0.5 g/dL, UPEP ≥ 200 mg per 
24 hours, or in subjects without detectable serum or urine M-protein, SFLC > 100 mg/L 
(involved light chain) and an abnormal kappa lambda ratio.

Carfilzomib  Page 96 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  Determination of PD while on study requires 2 consecutive assessments made at any time 
before classification of PD and/or the institution of new therapy.  Serum M-component 
increases of ≥ 1 g/dL from nadir are sufficient to define progression if nadir M- component is 
≥ 5 g/dL.  
Plasmacytomas:  A definite increase in the size is defined as a ≥ 50% increase as measured 
serially by the sum of the products of the greatest orthogonal cross -diameters of the 
measurable lesion s. A plasmacytoma is considered measurab le if the longest diameter is at 
least 1 cm and the product of the greatest orthogonal cross -diameters is at least 1 cm2.  
Plasmacytomas of lesser size will be considered non -measurable. The requirement for bi -
directional measurements applies only to plasm acytomas. The plasmacytoma specifications 
for PD are based on the sponsor’s interpretation of the IMWG- URC and practical 
considerations for study execution. Sources:  Durie 2006; Rajkumar 2011.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX I  SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN STUDY CFZ013 
AMENDMENT  3 
This Summary of Changes outlines noteworthy changes from protocol amendment 2.0 to 
protocol amendment 3.0, and includes rationales for the changes.  Administrative updates, 
typographical and formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.  The main 
purposes for revising the CFZ013 (20140241) protocol are listed below.  
Protoco l amendment 3 specifies the dosing selected for newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma (NDMM) Dose -expansion Arm 3.  The carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and 
dexamethasone (KRd) dosing for Arm 3 is as follows: carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1, then 56 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, and Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 
2-18.  Lenalidomide will be given at 25 mg on Days 1-21, and dexamethasone at 40 mg 
on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 of Cycles 1-8, and on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 9-18 (see Cohort 1 
dosing in Table 2).  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PDn) sample collection schedule was modifi 
ed to reflect the dosing selected.  Cycle 2 sampling that was introduced in 
protocol amendment 2, in anticipation of a 2- step-up dosing regimen, has been removed 
as it is not required for the dosing selected for Dose-expansion Arm 3. 
Two revisions
 were made in response to the carfilzomib US Prescribing Information 
(USPI) labelling change approved by FDA in November 2016, which required a 25% 
dose reduction in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment:  
• Table 9 (Treatment Guidelines for Nonhematologic Toxicity) has been modified 
to align with requested changes.  Specifically, NCI Organ Dysfunction Working 
Group definition of mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment were used  
(Shibata et al, 2013) : 
o mild: total bilirubin (>33% direct)  > the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
and ≤  1.5x ULN OR total bilirubin (>33% direct)  ≤ ULN and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  > ULN;  
o moderate: total bilirubin   .5x ULN and ≤ 3x ULN, any ALT  or AST ;  
o severe: tot al bilirubin >  3x ULN, any ALT  or AST .   
Subjects with  treatment -emergent  mild or moderate hepatic impairment, per 
this definition, are to have a 25% carfilzomib dose reduction.  In cases of severe 
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. CFZ013 
Carfilzomib  Page 108 of 108 
CONFIDENTIAL  hepatic  impairment , carfilzomib is to be held.   In moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment , lenalidomide is to be held.  
• Inclusion criteria have been modified  in Section 6.1.  Previous protocol 
amendments allowed enrollment of subjects with baseline mild hepatic 
insufficiency.  With protocol amendment 3 (under which only the NDMM dose-expansion A rm 3 subjects will be enrolled) , subjects will be required to have 
normal hepatic function.   The intent of this modification is to maximize the 
ability to give full, protocol- specified 20/56  mg/m
2 carfilzomib dosing to the 
enrolled NDMM subjects . 
Other minor changes:  
• To maintain internal consistency of the document, Dos e-expansion groups are 
uniformly referred to “Arms” with the term “Cohort” reserved for Dose-evaluation groups.  
• Changed the duration of enrollment from 8 to 12 months.

Congestive heart failure  Full dose  Any subject with symptoms of 
congestive heart failure, whether or 
not drug related, must have the dose held until resolution or return to baseline, after which treatment may 
continue at a reduced dose, or the subject may be permanently 
discontinued.  If no resolution after 
4 weeks, the subject will be 
withdrawn from all study treatment.

from baseline  Full dose  Hold carfilzomib until LVEF returns to ≥ 40% or, if held due to a 
drop to <  55%, to within 15% of 
baseline.  Resume at 1  dose 
decrement.  
Infections and Infestations  
Infection  
Grade 3 or 4  Hold both lenalidomide and carfilzomib until systemic 
treatment for infection is complete.  If ANC >  1,000/µL, 
resume both drugs at full dose.  If ANC <  1,000/µL, 
follow hematologic toxicities dosage guidelines.  
Hepatic Dysfunction and Related Investigations  
Mild liver dysfunction, defined as 
2 consecutive values, at least 28 days 
apart, of:  
(1) total bilirubin ( > 33% direct)  
> 1x ULN to < 1.5x ULN  
 OR  
(2) an elevation of AST and/or ALT 
with normal bilirubin  Full dose.  25% dose reduction.   
Dose may be re- escalated if liver 
function tests return to normal 
and drug -induced hepatotoxicity 
is excluded.

APPENDIX I  SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN STUDY CFZ013 AMENDMENT 2  
 
 This Summary of Changes outlines noteworthy changes from protocol amendment 1.0 to protocol amendment 2.0, and includes rationales for the changes.  Administrative updates, typographical and formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.  Updates have been implemented to align with the current template.  The main purposes for revising the CFZ013 (20140241) protocol are as follows:  
A Dose -evaluation Component is added for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
(NDMM) subjects.  During the conduct of the trial, NDMM subjects were enrolled into 
Dose -expansion Arm 1 (treated at Cohort 2 dosing; Table 2 and Appendix E). 
• When 2 serious adverse events were seen during Cycle 1 in the first 8 NDMM 
subjects, an ad hoc Cohort Safety Review Committee (CSRC) meeting was held.  
The CSRC elected to:  
o continue the study 
o evaluate NDMM subjects in Dose-evaluation cohorts prior to opening additional NDMM Dose-expansion cohorts 
o modify Cycle 1 dosing for NDMM subjects as shown in Table 2, Cohort 4.  After the ad hoc CSRC meeting, investigators were instructed to treat NDMM subjects at dosing herein referred to as Cohort 4 dos ing. 
• Dose -evaluation enrollment guideline text is modified.  The language was 
broadened, to apply to both relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma RRMM Dose -evaluation and the newly added NDMM Dose-evaluation components of the 
trial 
• Autologous stem cell tr ansplant (ASCT) is now allowed for NDMM subjects 
while remaining on trial.  The previous version allowed enrollment of transplant-eligible NDMM subjects and stem cell harvest but did not allow ASCT for subjects on trial.   
• Simplified study schema (Figure 1 ) 
• Revised blood collection schedule for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
for NDMM cohort, to reflect dosing schedule 
• Added dose rationale for new dosing regimen 
• Modified study duration, given delay in enrollment of NDMM subjects  
 
• For treatment guidelines:  
o modified guidelines for thrombotic microangiopathy and Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome to align with the current Carfilzomib Investigator’s Brochure Amgen/Onyx.

APPENDIX I  SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN STUDY CFZ013 AMENDMENT  3 
 This Summary of Changes outlines noteworthy changes from protocol amendment 2.0 to 
protocol amendment 3.0, and includes rationales for the changes.  Administrative 
updates, typographical and formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.  
Updates have been implemented to align with the current template.  The main purposes 
for revising the CFZ013 (20140241) protocol are listed below : 
Protocol amendment 3 specifies the dosing selected for newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma (NDMM) Dose -expansion Arm 3.  The carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and 
dexamethasone (KRd) dosing for Arm 3 is as follows: carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 on 
Day 1 of Cycle 1, then 56 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, and Days 1, 8, and 15 
of Cycles 2 -18.  Lenalidomide will be given at 25 mg on Days 1-21, and 
dexamethasone at 40 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 of Cycles 1-8, and on Days 1, 8, and 15 
of Cycles 9 -18 (see Cohort 1 dosing in Table 2).

CONFIDENTIAL  The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PDn) sample collection 
schedu
le was modified to reflect the dosing selected.  Cycle 2 sampling that was 
introduced in protocol amendment 2, in anticipation of a 2 -step-up dosing regimen, 
has been  removed as it is not required for the dosing selected for Dose-expansion 
Arm 3.  
Two rev
isions were made in response to the carfilzomib US Prescribing Information 
(USPI) labelling change approved by FDA in November 2016, which required a 
25% dose reduction  in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment:  
• Table 9 (Treatment Guidelines for Nonhematologic Toxicity) has been 
modified to align with requested changes.  Specifically, NCI Organ 
Dysfunction Working Group definition of mild, moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment were used (Shibata et al, 2013): 
o mild: total bilirubin (>33% direct)  > the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
and ≤ 1.5x ULN OR total bilirubin (>33% direct)  ≤ ULN and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  > ULN;  
o moderate: total bilirubin   .5x ULN and ≤ 3x ULN, any ALT or AST;  
o severe: total bilirubin >  3x ULN, any ALT or AST.   
Subjects with treatment -emergent mild or moderate hepatic impairment, per 
this definition, are to have a 25% carfilzomib dose reduction.  I n cases of 
severe hepatic impairment, carfilzomib is to be held.  In moderate or severe hepatic impairment, lenalidomide is to be held.  
• Inclusion criteria have been modified in Section 6.1.  Previous protocol 
amendments allowed enrollment of subjects with baseline mild hepatic 
insufficiency.  With protocol amendment 3 (under which only the NDMM 
Dose- expansion Arm 3 subjects will be enrolled), subjects will be required to 
have normal hepatic function.  The intent of this modification is to maximize the ability to give full, protocol- specified 20/56  mg/m
2 carfilzomib dosing to 
the enrolled NDMM subjects.  
Other minor changes:  
• To maintain internal consistency of the document, Dose-expansion groups 
are uniformly referred to “Arms” with the term “Cohort” reserved for Dose-
evaluation groups.  
• Changed the duration of enrollment from 8 to 12 months.

AMENDMENT 2 
 This Summary of Changes outlines noteworthy changes from protocol amendment 1.0 
to protocol amendment 2.0, and includes rationales for the changes.  Administrative 
updates, typographical and formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.  Updates have been implemented to align with the current template.  The main purposes for revising the CFZ013 (20140241) protocol are as follows:  
A Dose-evaluation Component is added for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
(NDMM) subjects.  During the conduct of the trial, NDMM subjects were enrolled into 
Dose-expansion Arm 1 (trea ted at Cohort 2 dosing; Table 2 and Appendix E ). 
• When 2 serious adverse events were seen during Cycle 1 in the first 8 NDMM 
subjects, an ad hoc Cohort Safety Revi ew Committee (CSRC) meeting was held.  
The CSRC elected to: 
o continue the study 
o evaluate NDMM subjects in Dose-evaluation cohorts prior to opening 
additional NDMM Dose -expansion cohorts 
o modify Cycle 1 dosing for NDMM subjects as shown in Table 2 , Cohort 4.  
After the ad hoc CSRC meeting, investigators were instructed to treat NDMM subjects at dosing herein referred to as Cohort 4 dosing. 
• Dose-evaluation enrollment guideline te xt is modified.  The language was 
broadened, to apply to both relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma RRMM 
Dose-evaluation and the newly added NDMM Dose-evaluation components of 
the trial 
• Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is now allowed for NDMM subjects while remaining on trial.  The previous version allowed enrollment of transplant-eligible NDMM subjects and stem cell harvest but did not allow 
ASCT for subjects on trial.   
• Simplified study schema ( Figure 1 ) 
• Revised blood collection schedule for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
for NDMM cohort, to reflect dosing schedule 
• Added dose rationale for new dosing regimen 
• Modified study duration, given delay in enrollment of NDMM subjects  
 
• For treatment guidelines: 
o modified guidelines for thrombot ic microangiopathy  and Posterior 
Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome to align with the current Carfilzomib Investigator’s Brochure Amgen/Onyx. Carfilzomib 
Investigator’s Brochure. Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an Amgen Inc. subsidiary).

Pediatric Population with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (Study H6D -MC -LVIG)
Number of Planned Patients:  24enrolled, 
15complete .  At least 2 completers per weight cohort
should not be taking concomitant endothelin receptor 
antagonists ( ERAs).Phase of Development:  1b/2
Length of Study:   Period1: 10weeks (approximately 35 days at each dose level)
  Period2: Open -Label Extension (OLE): a minimum of 2 years
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
To characterize the pharmacokinetics ( PK)of tadalafil in a pediatric population with pulmonary arterial 
hypertensio n (PAH )to establish an appropriate dose range for further clinical research .
Secondary Objectives:
To assess the tolerability and safety of tadalafil in a pediatric population with PAH.
To compare tadalafil PK profile in a pediatric population with historical adult data from Study 
H6D -MC -LVGY.
To determine appropriate dose ranges for use in the evaluation of efficacy and safety of tadalafil.
To clinically assess the palatability of the tadalafil suspension.
Open -Label Extension Objective s (Period 2):
To evaluate long
-term safety while providing continued access to tadalafil for pediatric patients 
completing Period1.
To evaluate clinical worsening (CW), defined as any of the followin g:death, lung or heart 
transplantation, atrial septostomy or Potts shunt, hospitalization due to worsening PAH, new onset 
syncope, initiation of new PAH therapy , or increase of 1 or more in World Health Organization (WHO )
Functional Class (except for pat ients already in Class IV) only for patients unable to perform the 6 minute 
walk (6MW )test; worsening of WHO functional class by 1 or more for patients who can perform a 6MW 
test and who have a decrease of ≥20% in the 6 minute walk distance (for those pat ients who are ≥6 years 
of age).
To evaluate the cardiopulmonary hemodynamic changes from baseline (Period 1) to end of 3 month 
treatment in Period 2 as assessed by echocardiography.
Study Design:   Study LVIG is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, international, open -label, multiple ascending-dose study 
to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of tadalafil administered orally as a tablet or suspension to children 
with PAH .  Eligible patients will be f rom 6months to <18yearsof age at time of screening .  This study contains 
2study periods: PK/safety ( Period 1) and an OLE ( Period 2).  Each patient may continue in Period2for at least 
2years after participating in Period 1.

Study Drug, Dosage, and Mode of Administration :
Tadalafil will be administered orally in an open -label fashion .  The dose of tadalafil will be escalated from low to 
high for each patient.  For each weight cohort these 2 doses of tadalafil aredetermined by PK modeling such that 
the exposure will be expected to be similar to that observed with tadalafil 2.5 to 10 mgand 20 to 40mgin adults .  
However, all of the initial doses are open to subsequent alteration based on emerging safety and PK analyses 
throughout the study.   Although the oral route of administration is commonly used for dosing medicinal products 
to pediatric patients, it is acknowledged that children, especially the younger age groups, may require an age -
appropriate formulation. Therefore, a ready -to-use oral suspensio n containing 2.0 mg/mL tadalafil wi ll be used for 
the Light -weight cohorts <25 kg, nomin ally representing patients <8 years of age.
Tadalafil tablets ; 2.5 mg, 5mg, 10mg, 20mg, and 40 mg(that is , two 20 mgtablets); orally; once daily.
Oral suspension formulation (2.0 mg/mL) ; 1mgand 5mg; orally; once daily .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 6
LY450190Reference Therapy/Comparator ,Dose, and Mode of Administration: Not Applicable
Planned Duration of Treatment:   Tadalafil will be administered once -daily  for 10 weeks in 2sequential 5 week 
periods .  The OLE period will last at least 2 years.
Variables
Safety :Safety will be evaluated using spontaneously reported adverse events, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, 
physical examinations, body weight, height, WHO functional class, IQ, Tanner score, and centralized 12 -lead 
electrocardiograms ( ECGs) as outlined i n the schedule of events.
Bioanaly tical:Plasma concentrations of tadalafil.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic :The pharmacokinetic parameters estimated during analy sis willinclude area 
under the concentration -time curve (AUC), maximal concentration (C max), time of Cmax(tmax), apparent clearance 
(CL/F) ,apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F), and terminal half -life (t½) , as appropriate.
Explo ratory : Analy ses of hemodynamic data will utilize the following variables:  tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion, eccentricity index, pericardial effusion, maximal tricuspid regurgitant velocity .    
Health Outcomes: Not applicable .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 7
LY450190Statistical Evaluation Methods:
Statistical: All enrolled patients who take at least 1 dose of study medication and have eval uable PK data will be 
included in the PK analysis .  All enrolled patients who take study medication will be included in the safety 
analy sis.
Sample Size: No formal statistical analysis was performed to determine the sample size for this study .  In 
order to have at least 5 completers in each weight cohort, approximately 8 patients per weight cohort for a total 
of up to approximately 24may need to be enrolled, assuming a drop -out rate of approximately 30%.  Tadalafil 
plasma concentrations from at least 5 completers per weight cohort are considered to be sufficient to 
characterize the PK of tadalafil in pediatric patients .  Furthermore, safety and tolerability data from these 
patients will provide information to support the dose selection for the efficacy Stud y H6D -MC -LVHV.
Period 1:All enrolled patients w ho take at least 1 dose of study medication and have evaluable PK data will be 
included in the PK and the safety analy sis.  Prior to an individual patient being dose -escalated, the safety and 
PK data will be reviewed to assess the suitability of dose escalation.
Noncompartmental Pharmacokinetic Analyses: Evaluation of individual profiles during the study will be based 
on PK parameter estimates calculated by standard noncompartmental methods .  The purpose of th ese analyses 
will be to evaluate dose escalations in individual patients, and to evaluate (as data become available) the 
appropriateness of the starting doses .  The primary parameters for this evaluation will be area under the curve 
of concentration versus time (AUC) and Cmax.  Other noncompartmental parameters may be reported if 
appropriate .
Population Pharmacokinetic (PopPK) Analysis: The purpose of the PopPK analysis is to characterize tadalafil 
PK across the range of body weights and ages of patients en rolled in the study and in each cohort; to evaluate 
the effect of various covariates such as age, body weight, sex, and endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) use 
on tadalafil exposure; and to predict appropriate dose(s) in subsequent pediatric studies of tadalafil.
After 5 Middle -weight cohort patients have completed Period 1 and prior to the Light -weight cohort patients 
enrolling into the study, the results o f an interim analysis will be reviewed by a safety monitoring committee 
(SMC) .  The SMC will review all available study data and recommend proposed tadalafil dose levels for the 
Light -weight cohort .  A compartmental analysis of the concentration versus tim e data may also be performed 
to support PK simulations.
Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics by weight cohort and 
dose.  Additional analyses will be performed if warranted by review of the data .  Safety parameters that will be 
assessed include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAE) , safety lab parameters, ECGs, body 
weight, height, and vital signs.
Period 2:All patients who take study medication will be included in the long - term safety analysis .  Changes 
from baseline to endpoint in hemodynamic parameters collected byechocardiogram will be summarized .  
Patients will be pooled and analyzed as a single treatment group .  No formal statistical testing will be 
conducted and only summary sta tistics will be presented.
Safety will be assessed through TEAEs , SAEs , body weight, height, WHO functional class, IQ, Tanner score, 
and reason for discontinuation.

5.Introduction
5.1. General Introduction
Pulmo nary arterial  hypertensio n (PAH) is a rare, chronic, and progressive disease characterized 
by elevat ion of pulmo nary artery  pressure and pulmo nary vascular resistance, leading to right 
heart failure and death ( Rich 19 98; Barst 2004 ).  Pulmo nary arteri al hypertensio n can be further 
classified into i diopathi c PAH (IPAH), heri table PAH (FPAH), and associated PAH (APAH) .  
Condi tions that are associated with PAH include connect ive tissue diseases, congenital heart 
disease, portal  hypertensio n, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infect ion, schistosomiasis 
and so me drugs (particularly anorexigens) .
The pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis and management of PAH in children is similar to that 
in adults, though li ttle research h as been conducted in the pediatric populat ion.  The prevalence 
and incidence of PAH is significant ly lower in children than in adult s (Rubin 1997 ); ithas been 
estimated that about 0.5 per millio n children will be diagnosed with IPAH which accounts for 
about 50% of all pediatric PAH .  The Registry to EValuate Early And Long-term PAH Di sease 
Management (REVEAL Registry ), a m ulticenter, observat ional, United States -
(US-) based 
registry created to provide the characteristics and treatment patterns of patients with PAH, 
recent ly reported just 184 prevalent pediatric cases among 54 enrolling centers in the US 
(Barst 2008).  The sex ratio between female and male is approximately 2:1 in childhood 
(Badesch et al. 2010 ) and m edian survival in children <16 years, prior to the introducti on of  
specific therapies for PAH, was ≤6months (D’Alo nzo et al. 1991; Barst et al. 1999 ).
While sildenafil and bosentan have recent ly had l anguage added to their labels pertaining to the 
pediatric popul ation, there remain limit ed da ta on the safet y and efficacy of the approved adult 
treatm ents in a pedi atric popul ation.Therapeutic guidelines for children have therefore generally
followed those used in adults .  Therapi es current ly approved for the treatment of PAH in adult s, 
in various geographi es around the worl d, include prostacyclin and its analogues (epoprosteno l, 
trepostinil, iloprost, and beraprost), the endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan and
ambrisentan), and the phosphodiesterase ty pe-5 (PDE -5) inhibitors (sildenafil a nd tadal afil).
Tadal afil is an orally administered, potent, and selective PDE -
5inhibitor currently approved in 
the United States, European Unio n, Canada and in Japan for the treatment of erectile dysfunct ion 
(ED), both on -demand (at doses of 5 mg, 10mgand 20 mg) and once- daily  (at doses of 2.5 mg
and 5 mg), and for the treatm ent of pulmo nary arteri al hypertensio n (PAH) (at a dose of 40 mg 
daily) .
In adults, tadalafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with maximum concentrations 
(Cmax) in pla sma occurring at a median t ime of 2 hours .  The rate and extent of absorption from 
tadal afil 10mgand 20 mgare not i nfluenced by food .  Tadalafil is distributed into tissues, with 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 19
LY450190an apparent volume of distribution o f 62.6 L .  Tadalafil is cleared extens ively, with metabo lism 
by cytochrom e P450 (CYP) 3A4 being the major pathway .  The m ean terminal eliminat ion half -
life (t ½) for tadal afil is 17.5 hours .  Tadalafil pharmacokinet icsare linear with respect to time and 
dose over a range of 2.5 to20mg.  During tadalafil 20 mg once -daily dosing, steady -state pl asma 
concentrations were attained within about 5 days and the degree of drug accumulat ion was about 
1.6-fold.  A tadalafil 40 mgsingle dose i s rapidly absorbed, with Cmaxin plasma occurring at a 
median time of 4 hours , and within the range of that reported following a 20 mgsingle dose.  
Following tadal afil 40mgonce -daily, the apparent clearance at steady  state (CL ss/F) and 
accumulat ion rati os rem ained stati onary  between Day 5 and Day 10.  I ncreas es in both C maxand 
area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC )areless than proportional as the dose 
increases fro m 20mgto 40 mg.  Specifically, d ue to decrease
d bioavailabilit y with 40mgonce -
daily  doses com pared to l ower doses, a 2 -fold cha nge in dose from 20 mgto 40 mgresul ts in a 
48% increase in exposure .
The safet y and efficacy  of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in adults was invest igated in a 
16-week pl acebo -controlled study  (Study  H6D -MC-LVGY [LVGY] ) which demonstrated that, 
overal l, tadal afil 40mgonce -daily  dosing was effective in the treatment of patients with PAH 
and was associated with an increase in exercise capabilit y.  
Tadal afil 40mgwas well tol erated in 
the adult PAH pati ent popul ation with a safet y profile similar to th at observed in the erectile 
dysfunct ion pat ient populat ion.  Populat ion pharmacokinet ic (PopPK )data from Study  LVGY 
show that exposure to tadalafil is not influenced by age, cardiovascular condit ions, sex, ethnicit y, 
PAH history  or durati on, creatinine clearance (CC) , total  serum  protein, wei ght, warfarin, or 
digoxin, thereby  suggest ing that tadala fil can be administered wi thout regard to these factors .  
Concomitant bosentan therapy increased the apparent oral clearance o f tadal afil by 75%, 
resul ting in a 35% decrease in exposure in pat ients receiving 40 mgtadal afil.  In pati ents wi th 
PAH not recei ving conco mitant bosentan, the predicted median tadalafil exposure at steady -state 
was 26% higher when compared to that in healthy vo lunteers.  There were no clinically relevant 
differences in mean Cmaxcompared to healthy vo lunteers.  The results suggest a potentially lower 
mean clearance o f tadal afil in pat ients with PAH com pared to heal thy volunteers.
An aqueous, ready -to-use suspensio n for oral  administrati on of  2.0mg/mL tadal afil has been 
developed for use in y ounger children .  A rel ative bioavailabilit y study  (Study  H6D -MC-LVIF
[LVIF] ) has been performed in healt hy adult s to i nvestigate the relative bioavailabilit y of one 
20mgtablet com pared to a suspension containing 20 mgtadal afil.  Study  LVIF also assessed the 
pharmacokinet ics of the tadalafil s uspensi on over the 20 mgto 40mgdose range .  The results 
from Study  LVIF dem onstrated that the 20 mgsuspensio n produced a 23% lower Cmaxfor 
tadal afil and significant del ay intime o f maximum observed concentration (tmax)of 1hour 
compared to the 20mgtablet .  However, o verall exposure to tadalafil was similar for the 20mg
suspension and tablet, with the 90% confidence interval s for the rati os falling wit hin the 
bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25.  Exposure to tadalafil during the absorption/distri bution 
phase is lower for the 20 mgsuspensio n compared to the 20mgtablet, wi th AUC (0-6)and 
AUC (0-12)being 25% and 16% lower .  Results indicated a less -than-dose-proporti onal increase in 
tadal afil exposure over the 20mgto 40mgdose range for the suspension formulat ion.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 20
LY450190Given the efficacy and safet y resul ts of tadal afil for the treatment of PAH in adults (Study  
LVGY), and recognizing the importance of providing prescribers and pat ients with 
recommendat ions reflecting tadalafil e xperi ence across devel opmental  stages, Lilly is pursuing 
the development of tadalafil for the treatment of PAH in pat ients ≥6months of age to <18 years
of age.
More detailed informat ion about the known benefits and risks of tadalafil may be found in the 
Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
5.2. Rationale and Justification for the Study
Despite the lack of therapies wit h an approved indication in children, there is a growing body  of 
evidence support ingthe use of therapies approved in adults that has led to widespread off-label 
usein children (Beghetti  2009 ) .  Therefore, there is a need to provide physicians wit h safety  and 
efficacy  resul ts of all treatm ent opti ons, incl uding tadal afil, in the pediatri c popul ation.
Beyond anecdotal  reports, experience wit h tadalafil ex posure in pediatric patients does not exist, 
other than that in a single 14 -year-old female patient (73 kg) who received tadalafil 2.5 mgin 
Study  LVGY .  Thi s pat ient com pleted the study  and subsequent ly enro lled in the extensio n 
Study  LVGX at a dose of ta dalafil 40 mg.
Given the limited safet y, PK, and efficacy data in pediatric patients with PAH, the Sponsor is 
conducting this study .  The study  will assess the PK profile of tadalafil administered once -daily 
in tablet and suspensio n formulation to pediatri c pati ents wi th PAH, and will assess safety  and 
tolerance , in order to i dentify appropriate doses to be invest igated further in a larger safet y and 
efficacy  study .

LY4501907.Investigational Plan
7.1. Summary of Study Design
Study  LVIG i s a Phase 1b/2, mult icenter, internat ional, open -label, m ultiple ascending- dose 
study  to eval uate the safet y and ph armacokineti cs of  tadal afil administered orally  as a tabl et or 
suspension to children with PAH .  Eligible patients will be f rom 6months to <18years of age at 
time of screening.  Thi s study  contains 2study  periods: PK/safety ( Period1) and an open -label
safet y extensi on(OLE )
(Period2).  Approximately 24 patients may be entered into this study to 
ensure that a minimum o f 15patients ( at least 5 in each body -weight cohort, of which ≥2 are not 
currently receiving endothelin receptor antagonist [ERA ]PAH t herapy and ≥
3are treated with 
ERA) complete the planned progression through low and high doses of tadalafil when taking into 
consideration ant icipated pati ent drop -out rates .  Of the 15 completers, at least 3 patients will be 
≤6 years of age and at least 2patients will be ≤2 years of age.  Peri od1 is approximately 
10weeks ( that is, approximately 5 consecut ive weeks for each dose [low and high]) 
(Figure LVIG. 7.1).  The completer populat ion is defined as all pat ients who are assigned to 
treatm ent and receive the 2 ascending dose levels of tadalafil administered once -daily and 
complete PK sample collec tion on putative steady -state of high dose .  Each patient may cont inue 
intoPeriod2for at least 2 years after participating in Period1.
The body -
weight cohorts are defined as:
Heavy: ≥40kg
Middle: ≥25kg to <40 kg
Light: <25kg
Dosing o f all weight co horts is described in Table LVIG. 9.1.  Tadal afil doses were selected to 
mimic ty pical drug exposures observed in adults wit h PAH (Study  LVGY) .  
The He avy-weight 
and Middle -weight cohorts will be enrolled concurrent ly.  Dosing and evaluat ion of the Middle -
weight cohort m ust be com pleted before enrolling patients in the Light -weight cohort.
The 5 -week (35 -day) treatment duration at each dose during Peri od1was selected to ensure 
sufficient time to reach steady  state and all ow time toprocess PK samples and analyze data in 
each patient pri or to the scheduled dose escalat ion.
Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed on all investigator site visits during the s tudy, and when 
spontaneously reported .  Vital signs, el ectrocardi ogram s(ECG s), physical examinat ion, and 
clinical laboratory  tests will  be perform ed at times specified in Attachment 1 .  Patients treated 
with oral suspensi on will also com plete a questi onnaire to assess the palatabilit y of the 
suspension formulat ion during Period1.
Dose escalat ion from the low to hi gh dosing level for each patient during Period1may begin on 
approximately  Day 36, approximately  5week s after the start of treatment .  
Selection of the high 
dose in each pat ient will be based on the PK data collected on Day 1 and Day 14, and on the 
safet y data and any clinically  significant phy sical signs or safet y lab results up to approximately 
4week s after the start of treatment .  Safet y and PK data will be reviewed by  both the invest igator 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 23
LY450190and the Sponsor before begi nning the higher dose regimen .  Secti on8.2.2.2 specifies the dose 
escalat ion gui dance to be followed during the dose escalation review .  Thi s revi ew m ay resul t in 
refinement of the individual dose -escalat ion regimen.
When 5 patients fro m the Middle-weight cohort have completed Period 1, the safet y, tolerabili ty 
and summary  of PK analyses fro m all pat ients will be reviewed by a safety  monitoring 
comm ittee (SMC) .  Based on this review, the SMC will advise Lilly as to the appropriateness o f 
continuing the study  and enrolling patients into the Light-weight cohort.  The SMC will provide 
recommendat ions immediately  after review.

7.1.1. Study Periods
7.1.1.1. Period 1
In Period1, tadalafil will be administered once -daily  for approximately  10week s (~35 days at 
each dose level) in 2 sequent ial steps .  
Please refer to Figure LVIG. 7.1.
7.1.1.2. Period 2
Period2will evaluate the long -term safet y of tadalafil while providing cont inued access to 
tadal afil for pe diatric patients com pleting Period1.
The patients participat ing in Period1may enro ll in the open -label extensio n Period2.  Peri od2, 
will cont inue for at least 2 years or until  the Sponsor concl udes the study , whichever occurs first .  
At the beginning ofPeriod2, the starting dose for each pati ent may vary depending on wei ght 
cohort and tolerabilit ybut will not exceed the maximum weight range dose established in 
Period1.  For the first 3 months of Period 2 the target dose will deliver a tadalafil exp osure 
equivalent to that seen with 20 mg in adults, as long as that dose does not exceed the maximum 
weight range, dose established in Period 1.  After the first 3 months of Period 2, the dose may  
then 
be increased (as judged by the invest igator ), but will not exceed the maximum weight range 
dose established in Period 1.  During Period 2, the dose for each patient might be adjusted per 
SMC recommendat ion based on more safet y and efficacy  information gathered during this study , 
or the efficacy  Study  LVHV .  Please refer to Figure LVIG. 7.1.  For discont inued patients who do 
not participate in Period 2, AEs occurring after a patient has taken the last dose o f study  drug 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 24
LY450190will be co llected for an addit ional 30days, regardless of seriousness or the Invest igator's opinio n 
of causat ion.
Clinical worsening will be evaluated during the study .  Assessment of clinical worsening is 
defined as:
1. All- cause mortalit y.
2.Lung or Heart -Lung Transplantation.
3.Atrial Septostomy or Potts Shunt.
4.Hospitalization for PAH progression:
Hospitalization for PAH progression should not be due to a potentially preci pitating event 
such as pneumo nial hemopt ysis etc.; however, if after the hospitalizat ion is co mpleted, 
the pati ent is discharged and the patient remains worse, then the patient can be assessed 
for clinical worsening.
5.Worsening of PAH
Patient has any  of the f ollowing criteria:
a.New onset syncope.
b.Addit ion of new PAH specific conco mitant therapy  including but not 
restri cted to epoprostenol or treprostinil, sildenafil, vardenafil, or increase in 
dose of exist ing PAH specific conco mitant therapy (for example, ERA or 
beraprost ).
c.Increase of 1 or more in WHO Funct ional Class (excep t for pati ents al ready  in 
Class IV; Attachm ent 4 )only for pati ents unable to perform  the 6MW test.
d.Worsening of WHO functional class and a decrease of 20% in the 6MW test 
for those pati ents who are ≥6years of age and are developmentally capable of 
performing the 6MW test .
7.2. Discussion of Design and Control
The p harmacokinet ics of tadal afil in pediatric subjects have not been explored .  This study  is a 
multiple ascending- dose study  with dosing predicted to approximate the exposures seen 
previously in adults wit h PAH (Study  LVGY) .  In Peri od 1, t adalafil will be administered a t
2dose l evels over 10 week s.
Patients will  be grouped by body  weight so that H eavy-and Mi ddle-weight children ,in who m 
exposure may be more accurately predicted fro m the adult populat ion,
are assessed prior to 
enrolling Light-weight children .  Light-weight children will not be exposed to tadalafil until at 
least 5 pati ents have co mpleted from the Middle -weight cohort.
The study  allows f or the limited use of certain concomitant PAH medicat ions.  Endothelin 
receptor antagonist s (that is, bosentan or ambrisentan) will be permitted, while conco mitant use 
of prostacy clin and its analogue s, and o f another PDE -5inhibitor will be contraindicated in 
Period 1.  Adult patients with PAH who were receiving conco mitant bosentan had decreased 
tadal afil plasma exposure; therefore, Study  LVIG will  enroll  at least 6 subj ects (2 per wei ght 
cohort) not receiving bosentan.
The concomitant use of another PDE -5inhibitor ( for example , sildenafil )or soluble guanylate 
cyclase st imulator (for example, riociguat) is prohibited during the study .  Subjects receiving 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 25
LY450190another PDE -5inhibitor will be required to discontinue the medicat ion at l east 24 hours prior to 
the baseline visit (Visit 2), which should suffice to allow for sy stemic eliminat ion of the PDE -5
inhibitor ( that is, at least 5 half -lives of the drug).
As the characteri zation of the pharmacokinet ics of tadalafil is the primary objective of the study , 
an open -label design is considered appropriate.
7.3. Determination of Sample Size
No formal stati stical analysis was performed to determine the sample size for this study .  The 
sample size is primarily chosen to provide adequate data to characterize the PK of tadalafil in a 
pediatric popul ation and to determine the dose selection for the efficacy  Study  LVHV.
Tadal afil plasma concentrations from at least 5 completers per weight coh ort should suffice to 
characterize the PK o f tadal afil in pediatric pati ents.  To have at least 5 completers in each 
weight cohort, approximately 8 patients per weight cohort for a total of up to approximately 
24may need to be enro lled, assuming a drop -out rate of approximately  30% .  Safet y and 
tolerabilit y data fro m these patients will provide informat ion to support the dose select ion for the 
efficacy  Study  LVHV .  If a patient is terminated after the Day 49 PK sample co llection, this 
patient will be defin ed as a com pleter and replacement will not occur .

8.1.3. Rationale for Inclusion and Exclusion of Certain Study 
Candidates
Inclusio n criteria [1], [2], [3], [4], and [7] are in place to ensure that PAH is properly  
characterized in pediatric pat ients.
Inclusio n criteria [5] and [6] are in place to ensure that pati ents receiving PAH therapy (s) are 
stabilized with regards to their therapy (s) pri or to entry  into this study .
Inclusio n criteria [8] is in place to prohibit inclusio n of pat ients who are pregnant or who are at 
risk of beco ming pregnant.
Inclusi on criteria [9] and exclusio n criteria [36] are in place to protect the safety o f each patient.
Exclusio n criteria [10], [11], [12], [13], [17], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [2 5], [26], [2 7], and [28] 
are in place to prohibit patients who have physical ex isting condit ions that would confound the 
trial resul ts.
Exclusio n criteria [14], [15], [16], [18], and [19] are in place to prohibit the enrollment of 
patients who are taking medicat ions that would confound the trial results .
Exclusio n criteria [20] is
inplace to prevent undue risk to an infant or fetus.
Exclusio n criteria [29] isin place to prevent the confounding impact that addict ive drugs may 
have on study  resul ts.
Exclusio n criteria [30], [3 1], and [35] are in place to prevent a previously enro lled patient from 
re-entering the study  that m ay have al ready had study  medicat ion.  
This woul d confound the 
analysis.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 30
LY450190Exclusio n criteria [32] isin place to assure that the patients can take the medicat ion in the forms 
that are available in this trial.
Exclusi on criteria [33] and [3 4] are in place to prevent possible study  bias from  close relati ons.
Exclusio n criteria [37] is in place to protect the patient since t he combinat ion ofPDE5 inhibitors 
and guanylate cy clase stimulators, such as riociguat may lead to symptomat ichypotension .
8.2. Discontinuation
8.2.1. Discontinuation Procedures
The nature of any condit ions, clinical signs or symptoms, or abnormal laboratory  values present 
at the time of discont inuat ion and any applicable follow -up procedures will be documented.
8.2.2. Discontinuation of Individual Patients
The cri teria for enrollment m ust be fo llowed explici tly.  If the invest igator site ident ifies a patient 
who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertent ly enro lled, the sponsor must be 
notified.  If the sp onsor i dentifies a pat ient who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was 
inadvertent ly enro lled, the invest igator site will be notified.  A discussio n must occur between 
the Lilly  clinical  pharmacol ogist or clinical research physician and the invest igator to determine 
whether the patient may  cont inue in the study , with or wi thout invest igational product.   
Inadvertent ly enro lled patients may be maintained in the study and on invest igational product 
when the invest igator and Lilly clinical pharmaco logist o r clinical research physician agree it is 
medically appropriate for that patient .  The pati ent may not continue in the study  with or wi thout 
investigat ional product if the Lilly  clinical  pharmacol ogist or clinical research physician does not 
agree wi th theinvest igator’s determinat ion that it is m edically appropriate for the patientto 
continue.  The invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the Lilly clinical 
pharmaco logist or clinical research physician to allow the inadvertent ly enrolled pat ient to 
continue in the study  with or wi thout invest igational product.
8.2.2.1. Early Discontinuation from Study
Some possible reasons for early  discontinuat ion of study participation:
Enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an off -label use of an 
investigat ional drug or devi ce or enrollment in any other ty pe of m edical  research 
judged not to be scient ifically or medically co mpatible with this study.
If Exclusio n Cri terion [18], [19], [20], [22 through 28], [3 2], [36] , or[37] is 
observed, or develops, after entry  or enrollment .  In this case, the patient will be 
discontinued fro m the drug/study  at the next visit or sooner in the event of a 
safet y exclusi on cri terion.
oExcept ion: A pat ient receiving an ERA who develops an AST or ALT >3 
times upper limit of norm al may remain in the study , but m ust have ERA 
dosage adjust ments and monitoring that are consistent with the adult 
recommendat ions in the respective ERA labels.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 31
LY450190The Investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn .  If this decisio n is 
made becaus e of a SAE or a clinically significant laboratory  value, the study  drug 
is to be discont inued and appropriate measures are to be taken .  Lilly or its 
designee is to be alerted immediately .  For further informat ion, please refer to 
Secti on10.4, Safet y Evaluat ions.
The patient, the patient’s legal guardian, or the attending physician requests that 
the pati ent be wi thdrawn from  the study .
In Peri od1, the patient, for any  reason, requires treatment with another 
therapeuti c agent that has been demo nstrated to be effect ive for treatm ent of the 
study  indicat ion.  In this case, discontinuation from the study occurs prior to 
introducti on of  the new agent.
Patients experiencing clinical worsening in Period 1 (as defined in Sect ion 
7.1.1.2 ) will be discont inued fro m the study  and receive standard of care . Patients 
in Period 2experiencing cli nical  worsening (as defined in S ection 7.1.1.2 ) will be 
managed at the discreti on of  the invest igator; howev er, the patient m ay continue 
in the study .
The Investigator or Lilly stops the study  or stops the patient’s participat ion in the 
study  for medical, safet y, regul atory , or other reasons consistent with applicable 
laws, regulations, and good clinical practic e.
The invest igator determines that the patient is repeatedly nonco mpliant with study  
procedures and/or study  drug.
If the patient experiences priapism then the patient must be discont inued fro m the 
study  
Patients who discont inue the study will have an ea rly terminati on visi t perf ormed at 
the time o f the pati ent’s study  discontinuati on, or at the earliest possible date .  This 
early  terminat ion visit will be used to collect as many data/samples as practical fro m 
the pati ent.  The early terminat ion data/samp le co llections will be the same as those 
collected at end of Week 10 of Period1, or the final visit of Period2, depending on 
the timing of discont inuat ion.
8.2.2.2. Termination of the Dose Escalation
Dose escalat ion within each weight cohort will be based upon on going review of safet y, 
tolerabilit y data, and pharmacokinet ic analyses .  
The following cri teria will be emplo yed to 
determine if dose escalation is appropriate:
If ANY of the following criteria are met, the patient should not have their dose escalated .
Dose levels may be repeated or reduced, if required, to better ident ify thresho lds for 
tolerabilit y.
Severe Adverse Events:
A pat ient experiences an SAE related to study  drug.
Priapism (discont inue pat ient per Secti on 8.2.2.1 ).
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 32
LY450190Unexpected and abnormal vaginal bleeding of mo derate to severe intensit y.
Symptom atic postural hypotension considered related to study  drug.
Nonarteri tic Anteri or Ischemic Opt icNeuropathy  (NAION) and related terms.
Hearing loss and related terms.
In the event of an SAE related to study  drug, other than precaut ionary inpatient observat ion, 
dosing will be suspended for the patient pending notification o f the ethical review board ( ERB)
and appropriate regulatory  authori ties.  Do sing will only resume after the ERB, invest igator, and 
Sponsor agree on the appropriateness of further dosing.
Shoul d an individual pat ient meet eitherof the PK cri teria below on Day 1orDay 14, then the 
patient may  not increase to the high dose level.
Pharmacokinet ic Result s:
An observed tadalafil Cmaxexceeds the meanCmaxof 700 ng/mL measured 
during 40mgonce -daily dosing to adul t pati ents wi th PAH (Study  LVGY) .
An AUC (0 -24) exceeds the meanAUC ( 0-24) of 13,700 ng hr/mL measured
during 40mgonce -daily dosing to adul t pati ents wi th PAH (Study  LVGY) .
8.2.3. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study  site parti cipat ion may be discont inued if Lilly, t he invest igator, or the ERB of the study  
sitejudges it necessary for any  reason.
8.2.4. Discontinuation of the Study
The study  will be di scontinued if Lilly or its designee judges it necessary  for any  reason.   
Addit ionally , the study  may be discont inued at the recommendat ion of the Safet y Moni toring 
Committee.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 33
LY4501909.Treatment
9.1. Ration ale for Selection of Dose
In Period1, it is planned that tadalafil once -daily  doses will ini tially be administered as pre -
defined fixed doses 
(Table LVIG. 9.1) selected to mimic ty pical tadal afil exposures in adults at 
doses of 2.5mgto 40 mg.  However, all o f these init ial doses are open to alteration based on 
emerging safet y and PK analyses throughout the study .  
Each cohort will begin wit h the l ower of 
2doses and escalate to the high dose following approximately 5 week s at the l ower dose level .  
Pharmacokinet ic samples will be co llected per the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ) such that 
these data (in addit ion to safet y and tol erabili ty data) will be available prior to planned dose 
escalat ion, thus allowing the opportunit y to refine any individual’s dose progression.
At the beginning of Period2, the dose may vary depending on weight cohort and tolerabilit yfor 
each individual from Period 1.  During Period 2, the dose for each patient might be adjusted per 
SMC recommendat ion as more safet y and efficacy informat ion beco me available during this 
study or the efficacy Study  LVHV .  
For the first 3months of Period 2the target dose will deliver 
a tadal afil exposure equivalent to that seen wit h 20 mg in adult s, as l ong as that dose does not 
exceed the maximum weight range dose established in Period 1. Aft er the first 3months of 
Period 
2the dose may then be increased (as judged by the invest igator), but will not exceed the 
maximum weight range dose established in Period 1.
Table LVIG. 9
.1. Planned Tadalafil On ce-Daily Dosing in Period 1 for Study LVIG
Planned Tadalafil Dosing
Period 1 Period 2
Study Cohort by Weight Low Dose High Dose Initial Dose
Heavy (≥40 kg) 10mg 40mg 20 mg
Middle (≥25kgto <40 kg) 5mg 10mg 7.5 mg
Light (<25 kg)a 1mg 5mg 3 mg
aTadalafil administered once daily in suspension formulation for Light-weight cohort.
From  the exposure -response relat ionship developed in adults wit h PAH, patients who benefited 
most from tadal afil treatment received doses of at least 20 mgof tadal afil once daily, irrespective 
of the PK influence of bosentan and other disease or patient -specific factors .Therefore, typical  
tadal afil exposures following administration of 20 mgand 40 mgonce daily  to adul ts were 
ident ified as reasonable targets for s election of maximum doses invest igated in pediatrics.
Based on these data from the tadalafil clinical development programs, the dose select ion strategy  
for pedi atrics is to define tadalafil doses that may  support once -daily  administrati on and maintain 
mean concentrati ons wi thin those ty pically  reported from  adul ts wi th PAH given com parable or 
slight ly higher doses of tadalafil ( Table LVIG. 9.1).  This is expected to provide an opportunit y to 
evaluate dose -dependent trends in pediatrics whil eminimiz ing significant excursio ns of tadalafil 
concentrations above the highest ty pically observed in most adult patients (<90thpercentile) .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 34
LY450190The doses selected should provi de tadalafil concentrations within the range of those produced by
5mgto 10mg(low dose) or 20mg to 40mg(high dose) of tadalafil administered to adults with 
PAH.
Detailed informat ion of the known benefits and risks of tadalafil is provided in th e IB.
9.2. Study Drug Formulations
Table LVIG. 9.2presents the planned init ial oral administration dosing o f tadal afil tablets or 
suspension in pediatric pat ients with PAH.   
If additio nal doses are required, they  will be 
achieved by utilizing the minimum number of tadalafil tablets possible.
Table LVIG. 9.2. Tadalafil Study Drug Regimens 
Tablet Dose: 5mg 7.5 mg 10mg 20 mg 40mg
Tablets: 1 × 5 mg 1 × 5 mg and 1 × 2.5mg 1 × 10 mg 1 × 2 0mg 2 × 20 mg
Suspension Dose: 1mg 3 mg 5mg
Volume a: 0.5mL 1.5 mL 2.5mL
aVolume of a tadalafil pediatric suspension (2 mgtadalafil/ml).
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country ’s regul atory  requi rements.
The formulat ions for use include the authorized 2.5 mg, 5mg, 10mgand 20 mgCialis ®tablets, 
and an oral tadalafil suspensio n formulation (2.0 mgtadal afil/m L).  No placebo tablets or 
placebo suspensio n will  be used .  All formulations will be administered orally, once daily.
Tadal afil film -coated tabl ets:  Tadalafil tablets will be used for the M iddle -and Heavy -weight 
cohorts .  In addit ion to tadalafil, the tablets contain lactose monohydrate as a diluent, 
hydroxypropyl cellulose as a binder, croscarmellose sodium as a disintegrant, microcry stalline 
cellulose as a disintegrant and dry  binder, sodium lauryl sulfate as a wetting agent, and 
magnesium stearate as a lubricant .  The film coatings consist of lactose monohydrate, 
hypro mellose, ti tanium  dioxide, tri acetin, and yellow ferric oxide and red ferric oxide in the 
color mixtur es.  Tadalafil tablets will be provided in either a blister pack or bottle .  It is stable 
when stored at room temperature .
Tadal afil oral  suspensi on:  Although the oral route of administration is commo nly used for 
dosing medicinal products to pediatric pat ients, it is acknowledged that children, especially the 
younger age groups, may require an age- appropri ate form ulation. Therefore, a ready -to-use oral 
suspension containing 2.0 mg/mL tadal afil will be used for the Light -weight cohorts <25 kg, 
nominally re presenting pat ients <8 years of age .  
The suspensio n contains 2.0 mg/mL of tadal afil 
in a ready -to-use suspensio n vehicle .  The aqueous vehicle is preserved wit h sodi um benzoate .  
The suspensio n contains the inact ive ingredients Avicel RC 591, xanthan gum, polysorbate 80, 
collo idal silicon dioxide, simethico ne emulsio n, sorbitol so lution, sodium citrate, and citric acid .  
The suspensio n is art ificially cherry flavored and sweetened with sucralose .  Tadalafil oral 
suspension is stable when stored at room tem perature.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 35
LY450190Tadal afil liquid suspension will be provided in a plastic bottle and doses will be delivered to the 
patient using a standard sy ringe.
Tadal afil is not affected by  food, and therefore the pediatric formulation can be administered 
with or wi thout food.
9.3. Study Drug Administration
Patients will  be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a 
complaint or probl em wi th the study  drug so that the situat ion can be assessed.
All clinical trial material provided to the invest igator will be stored in a secure place, and 
allocated and dispensed by appropriately trained persons .  The allocat ion and dispensing of the 
study  drugs will be fully documented and verified by  a second person .  Detailed records of the 
amounts of study  drug received, dispensed and remaining at the end of the study  will be 
maintained.
Either 1 or 2 tabl ets of  tadal afil, or 0.5 or 2. 5mL of tadalafil in suspensio n will be administered 
orally  with water in the m orning o f each dose day .  The ready -to-use tadala fil suspensi on shoul d
be mixed well by shaking and then administered wit hin 1 hour. The study drug will  be directly
administered into the mouth with the required suspensio n volume by using a standard syringe.   
Addit ional dilut ion or combination wit h other substrates or vehicles is not allowed. Patients may 
be dosed whether or not they  have eaten.  Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice should
be avo ided 1 hour prior to and after dosing.
9.4. Specific Restrictions/Requirements
The invest igator is respons ible for ensuring that the parent/legal representative and pat ient, if 
capable, understand the risks and benefits of participat ing in the study , including answering any 
questions the patient and/or parent/legal representative may  have throughout the study  and 
sharing in a t imely manner any  new informat ion that m ay be relevant to the patient's and/or 
parent/l egal representative’s willingness to continue his or her participat ion in the trial.
The informed consent document (ICD) will be used to explain the ris ks and benefits of study  
participat ion to the patient and/or parent/legal representative in simple terms before the patient is 
entered into the study , and to docum ent that the pati ent and/or parent/legal representative is 
satisfied with their understanding of the ri sks and benefits of part icipating in the study and 
desires to parti cipate in the study .
The invest igator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by each patient and/or 
parent/l egal representative .  Thi s includes obtaining the a ppropri ate si gnatures and dates on the 
ICD and assent document, if applicable, prior to th e perform ance of any protocol procedures and 
prior to the administration o f study  drug.
A parent or legal representative must give informed consent for a child to participate in this 
study .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 36
LY450190Throughout the study , the patient may  be subject to medical assessment and review of 
compliance wi th restri ctions before continuing in the study .  The patient should continue to meet 
the inclusio n and exclusio n criteria at the st art of each dosing period, including restrictions 
related to contraception and medicat ion use.
9.4.1. Special Treatment Considerations
Patients who discont inue the study will have an early termination visit performed at the time of 
the pati ent’s study  discontinua tion, or at the earliest possible date .  During Period 1, patients who 
wish to begin or add a new concomitant medicat ion for the treatm ent of PAH will be 
discontinued fro m the study .  However, addit ional or new concomitant medicat ion for the 
treatm ent of P AH will be allowed in Period 2.
9.5. Blinding
Study  LVIG i s an open -label multiple ascending dose study  and therefore will not be blinded for 
treatm ent.
9.6. Concomitant Therapy
Chronic use of d rugs that are known potent inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrom e P450 3A 4 
(CYP3A4 )shoul d be prohibi ted.  Addit ional drugs are to be avoided during the study  unless 
requi red to treat an AE or for the treatment of an ongo ing medical problem .
If the need for concomitant medicat ion arises, inclusi on or continuat ion of a patient m ay be at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator after consultation wit h a Lilly clinical research scient ist or clinical 
research physician .  Any addit ional medicat ion used during the course of the study  must be 
docum ented. Medicines and therapies that would p revent a patient fro m enrolling in the study  
are identified in the exclusio n sect ion of this protocol (see Section8.1.2 ), such as:
Prostacy clin or its analogues.
Concurrent PDE -5 inhibitor (other than study medication)
Nitrates
Doxazosin or Other cancer chemotherapy
Antiretrovi ral therapy (protease inhibitors), systemic ketoconazole, or sy stemic 
itraconazo le.
Potent sy stemic CYP3A4 inhibitors and ind ucers
Guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat
Patients who receive any conco mitant medicat ion listed in the exclusion criteria fo llowing 
enrollment and before study drug administration should not receive study drug .  During Period 1, 
patients requ iring treatment with any o f the prohibited medicat ions during the study  will be 
discontinued fro m the study  and will  com plete a termination visit .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 37
LY450190For pati ents receiving bosentan, dosage adjust ment and m onitoring for those devel oping 
aminotransferase abnor malities must be followed according to the approved Tracleer (bosentan) 
labeling informat ion.
Post-study therapy wit h another PDE -5 inhibitor should be delayed at least 96 hours after the last 
dose of the study  drug i s administered.
Patients will  be instru cted to consult with the Investigator or Study  Coordinator at the study  site 
before taking newly  prescribed medicat ions.  All non-study  medicat ions will be recorded on 
source documents at all visit s.  No n-study  medicat ions for patients who screen fail willnot be 
reported to Lilly  unless the medication is linked to an SAE or adverse event of which the 
Invest igator believes may have been caused by a protocol procedure .

Collection
10.1. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacod ynamic Evaluations
10.1.1. Samples for Pharmacokinetic Measurements
Blood sam ples of a maximum o f0.5mL each will be co llected into appropriate tubes predose 
and 2, 4, 8 , 12, and 24 hours postdose , and used to determine the plasma concentrations of 
tadal afil.  One trough PK sample will also be co llected at Visit 10 to evaluate the tadalafil 
exposure after 3 months of treatment during Period 2.   The actual date and 24 -hour clock time of 
each sampling will be recorded.  Analgesic cream (e.g., eutectic mixture of l ocal anesthet ics
[EMLA ]) mustbe offered to minimize pain at the venipuncture site.  The smallest practical 
diameter needle is recommended, and a cannula may be used to minimize the number of needle 
inserti ons.
Addit ional blood sam ples m ay be drawn if need ed for safet y purposes and/or if warranted and 
agreed upon between the invest igator and Sponsor or its designee .  Instructions for collect ion and 
handling of blood samples will be provided by  the Sponsor or i ts desi gnee.
10.1.2. Bioanalysis
Samples will  be analyzed at a l aboratory  approved by  the Sponsor .  Tadalafil c oncentrati ons will 
be assayed using a validated liquid chro matography –tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS )
method .
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure tadal afil concentrati ons will be retained for a 
maximum o f 1 year following l ast pati ent visi t for the study .  During this time, sample s
remaining after the bioanalyses may  be used for expl oratory  analyses such as metabolism and/or 
protein binding work .
10.1.3. Pharmacodynamic Evaluat ions
Not a pplicable .
10.2. Samples for Standard Laboratory Testing 
Blood and urine samples will be collected at the times specified in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).  Standard laboratory  tests, i ncluding chemistry, hematol ogy, coagul ation,and
urinalysis panels, will be performed.  A pregnancy test will be performed if applicable .  Other 
clinical laboratory  tests will  be analyzed by a central laboratory .  Attachment 2 lists the specific 
tests that will be performed for this study .
Invest igators must document their review of each safet y laboratory  report.
Samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, how ever, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study  to confirm  that the resul ts 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 39
LY450190are valid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or l aboratory  certificati on standards.
Attachm ent 3 provides a summary o f the blood sampling vo lumes.
10.3. Exploratory Work
10.3.1. Samples for Gene tic Testing
There i s growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable response to therapy  may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of action of the drug, the disease 
etiology and/or the m olecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where local 
regul ations allow, a 0.5 mL blood sample will be collected on a FTA card for pharmacogenetic 
analysis.  It is a one -time collection , as noted in the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
Samples will  be stored and analysis may  be performed on genet ic variants though t to pl ay a rol e 
in endothelial cell dysfunct ion, blood pressure and intracellular levels o f cGMP (including but 
not limited to GNB3, ACE, ENOS, PDE-5) to evaluate their associat ion with observed clinical 
outcom es to LY450190.
In the event of an unexpected AE or the observat ion of  unusual response, the samples may  be 
genoty ped and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genet ic association wit h response to 
LY450190.  These investigat ions m ay be limited to a focused candidate gene study  or, if 
appropriate, genome wide associat ion studi es may be perform ed to i dentify regions of the 
geno me associated with the variabilit y observed in drug response.  Samples will be used only for 
investigat ions rel ated to di sease and drug or class of drugs under study  in the context of this 
clinical program .  They  will not be used for broad exploratory  unspecified disease or populat ion 
genet ic analysis.
Samples will  be ident ified by the patientnumber (coded) and stored for up to 15 years after the 
last subject visit for the study  at a f acility selec ted by  the Sponsor.  The sample and any  data 
generated fro m 
it can only be linked back to the patientby invest igator site personnel.
10.4. Safety Evaluations
Period1
Safety will be evaluated using spontaneously reported adverse events, clinical laboratory  
data, vital signs, physical examinat ions, body  weight, hei ght,and ECGs.
Change from baseline to endpoint as measured by WHO functional classificat ion and six 
minute wal k test (for patients ≥6years of age) ; and
Percent increase in N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic pept ide(NT-Pro-BNP )
concentrations.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 40
LY450190Period2
Safety will be evaluated at each study  visit by m onitoring treatm ent-emergent adverse events, 
SAEs, WHO functional class, and reasons for discontinuat ion.  Body  weight, hei ght, 6MW test, 
IQ, and Tanner score will also be co llected in Period 2 as defined in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).  Tadalafil concentrations and protocol clinical laboratory  data will be co llected 
for pati ents when reporting a n SAE.
10.4.1. Safety Measures
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly  or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the pati ent.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious or that caused the patient to di scontinue before complet ing the study .  The 
patient shoul d be f ollowed unt il the event is reso lved or explained.  Frequency o f follow-up 
evaluat ion is left to the discret ion of the investigator.
In addit ion to records of observat ions made at specific times, unexpected signs and symptoms 
and conco mitant m edicati ons will be recorded in the clinical trial records throughout the study .  
Further routine medical assessments may  take pl ace during the study  as clinically indicated .
10.4.1.1. Physical Examination
Physica l examinat ions and routine medical assessments will be conducted as specified in the 
Study  Schedule and as clinically  indicated (Attachment 1 ).  Physical examinat ions will include 
an eye examinat ion.  In addit ion, Tanner Stage will be assessed at the time of specified in 
Protocol  Attachm ent 1 .
10.4.1.2. Vital Signs
Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) will be measured as specified in the Study  Schedule and as 
clinically indicated ( see Attachment 1 andAttachment 5 ).  After the init ial or subsequent 
increase in tadalafil dose, blood pressure and HR will be measured at 30 minutes , 60minutes , 
and then hourly  for 6 hours post dose.
Blood pressure and HR should be measured after the pat ient has been in supine posit ion for at 
least 2 minutes .
Addit ional vital signs may be m easured during each study  period if warranted and agreed upon 
between the Sponsor and invest igator .  Unscheduled orthostatic vital signs should be assessed, if 
possible, during any AE of dizziness or posture -induced symptoms .  Addit ional vital signs may  
be also be measured if clinically indicated.
10.4.1.3. Body Weight and Height
Body  weight and height will be recorded as specified in the Study Schedule and as clinically 
indicated (Attachment 1 ).
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 41
LY45019010.4.1.4. Electrocardiograms
Twelve -lead ECGs will be obtained according to the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).  Addit ional 
ECGs m ay be obtained during each study  period if warranted.
Ele
ctrocardi ogram swill be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
patient is st ill present, for immediate patient management and to determine whether the patient 
meets entry  criteria.  If the ECG shows a clinically important change, then the investigator 
shoul d assess if the patient can continue in the study .
The ECGs will subsequently be electronically  transmi tted to the centralized E CG vendor 
designated by  Lilly  for storage .  Some or all  ECGs may  be over read by  a medically -qualified 
professio nal (for example ,cardi ologist) to assess clinically  significant findings on the automated 
ECG readings .  Should an over read occur, the rationa le and strategy  for cardi ologist assessment 
of ECG abnormalit ies will be documented in the final study  report.
If an over read ECG is returned fro m the centralized ECG vendor, the invest igator or qualified 
designee is responsible to determine if any change to the subject’s management is needed and 
must docum ent his/her review by signing and dating the over read ECG .  Any clinically 
significant findings that result in a diagnosis should be recorded on the case report form (CRF) .  
Any clinically  significant f indings that do not result in a diagnosis should be commented on and 
appropriately  docum ented.
If there are differences in ECG interpretation between the invest igator or qualified designee and 
the ECG vendor cardio logist, the invest igator or qualified desi gnee's interpretation will prevail 
for study  entry  and immediate subject management purposes, and the ECG vendor cardiologist's 
interpretati on will  prevail  for data analysis purposes.
10.4.1.5. Special Procedure
10.4.1.5.1. Eye Examination
Eye examinat ionswill be performed according to the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).  The 
examinat ion includes pat ient medical  history , external eye examinat ion and retinal examinat ion
using an ophthalmo scope.
10.4.1.5.2. Inhibin Monitoring
Inhibin B mo nitoring will be collected accordi ng to the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ) from all 
male pa tients.  In patients below the age of 9 years, this will be an exploratory  assessment .
10.4.1.5.3. Intellectual Ability and Cognitive Functioning Assessment
The patient’ s intellectual  abilit y (intelligence quotient; IQ) will be assessed at Visit 2 (prior to 
first dose of study  drug), and after 1 y ear and 2 years fo llowing treatm ent ini tiation.  The 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children –Fourth Edit ion (WISC -IV) i s the preferred instrument 
for IQ assessment. Due to age restrict ions of the WISC -IV, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scale®-Fourth Edition (WAIS -IV®) and Wechsler Preschool and Primary  Scale of Intelligence 
Test (WPPSI -III) may also be used as detailed below . Patients may be assessed with a different 
scale at subsequent visits depending on their age.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 42
LY450190Patients who are age d2 years 6 months through 5 years 11 mo nthsat Visit 2 will be 
administered the WPPSI- III at Visit 2 and fo llow-up visits. For patients who completed 
the WPPSI -III at Visit 2 , they  will be administered the WISC -IV at any  subsequent visit 
if their age exceeds 7 years 3 m onths.
Patients who are age d6 years 0 months through 15 years 11 months at Visit 2 will be 
administered the WISC- IV at Visit 2 and fo llow-up visi ts. For pati ents who se age
exceed s  16 y ears 11 m onths at subsequent visits, then the WAIS -IVwill be 
administered.
Patients who are ages 16 y ears 0 m onths or ol der at Visit 2 will be administered the 
WAIS -IVat Visit 2 and all subsequent visits .
If the recommended versio ns of the IQ scales listed above are not available in the patients’ 
primary  language, the site may  use the m ost recent versio n of the available scale in that 
geography . Invest igator or site study personnel should ensure the instrument 
administrator/examiner and interpreter, either at the invest igator site or fro m an external  
evaluat ion service, meet the qualificat ion, training, and interpretation requirements per the 
instrum ent m anual .The IQ scales will be administered at the times according to the Study  
Schedule ( Attachme nt 1).Com prehensive reporting of the pati ent’s IQ i s not requi red in this 
study .
Patients will  not be excl uded f rom the study  if none of the recommended instruments are 
available in the pat ient's primary language or if no qualified examiner is available to conduct the 
evaluat ion. Not obtaining an intellectual abilit y assessment for th is study will not be a protocol 
violation, but notificat ion of this must be provided to the Lilly research physician pri or to the 
patient's enrollment.
10.4.1.5.4. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children® -Fourth Edition (WISC -IV®)
The fourth edit ion of the WISC asse ssment (WISC -IV®) i s administered to children ranging 
from 6 years to 16 y ears, 11 m onths. It contains 10 core subtests and 5 addit ional tests, and takes 
60-90 minutes to complete. In this study, the 10 core subtests needed to derive a Full Scale IQ 
score are required to be completed: Block Design, Similarit ies, Digit Span, Picture Concepts, 
Coding, Vocabulary , Letter -Number Sequencing, Matrix Reasoning, Comprehensio n, Symbo l 
Search.  The scaled score for each subtest and Full Scale IQ composite score ar e required to be 
entered into the eCRF.
10.4.1.5.5. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale® -Fourth Edition (WAIS -IV®)
The WAIS –IV structure was m odified to align wit h the WISC –IV® and to reflect current theory  
regarding cognit ive abilit y.The WAIS -IV® i s used as an intell igence m easure for persons age d
16 to 90 years and 11 months. The anticipated time for completion o f WAIS -IV® i s 
approximately  60-90 minutes. In this study, the 10 core subtests needed to derive a Full Scale IQ 
score are required to be completed:  Vocabu lary, Similari ties, Inform ation, Symbo l Search, 
Coding, Visual Puzzles, Block Design, Digit Span, Arithmet ic, and Matrix Reasoning. The 
scaled scores for each subtest and Full Scale IQ composite score are required to be entered into 
the eCRF.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 43
LY45019010.4.1.5.6. Wechsler Pre school and Primary Scale of Intelligence Test -3rd Edition
(WPPSI -III®)
The WPPSI -III® i s an intelligence test designed fo r children aged 2 y ears 6 m onths to 7 y ears 3 
months. The anticipated time for completion of WPPSI- III® is approximately 25 -60 minut es.In 
this study , the core subtests needed to compute a Full Scale IQ score are required to be
completed. For ages 2 years 6 months to 3 years 11 months, these 4 core subtests are: Receptive 
Vocabulary , Inform ation, Bl ock Design, and Object Assembly . For children ages 4 y ears 
0months to 7 y ears 3 m onths, these 7 core subtests are: Informat ion, Vocabulary , Word 
Reasoning, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning, Picture Concepts, and Coding. The scaled score 
for each subtest and Full Scale IQ score are requir ed to be entered into the eCRF.
10.4.1.5.7. Palatability Questionnaire
Subjects who are at least 3 y ears of age treated with oral suspensio n will co mplete a 
questionnaire to assess the palatabilit y of the suspensio n formulation at times according to the 
Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).
10.4.1.5.8. 6-Minute Walk (6MW) Test
The 6MW test is the most accepted exercise capacity  test and i s also the m ost comm only used 
clinical trial endpo int in adult PAH studies .  The reliable use of the 6MW test is limited in
patients <6years of age.  Therefore, 6MW test will be measured in patients who are ≥6years of 
ageand who are developmentally able (mentally and physically) in the opinio n ofthe 
investigator.  An un -encouraged 6MW test assessment will be conducted at time points specified 
in Attachment 1 .  The 6MW test will  be recorded and evaluated by  following 6MW test 
guidelines (see Attachm ent 6 ).  A practice of 6MW test may be conducted prior to the first of 
6MW test performance for each patient. If a patient has decrease of 20% or more in 6 minute 
walk distance com pared wi th baseline, another 6MW test will be conducted 5 to 10 da ys later to 
confirm the change.
10.4.1.5.9. Echocardiograph
The value o f echocardiography in diagnosing pulmonary  hypertensio n has been examined in 
various settings, including idiopathic pulmo nary hypertensio n, pulmo nary hypertensi on in 
systemic sclerosis, and pulmo nary hypertensi on associ ated wi th diffuse parenchymal lung 
disease. Echocardiography provides both estimates of pulmo nary artery  pressure and an 
assessment of cardiac structure and funct ion.These features just ify its application as the most 
commo nly used screening tool in pat ients with suspected pulmo nary hypertensio n.In thi s study  
echocardiography will be used to evaluate changes fro m baseline (Visi t 2)to end of 3 month 
treatm ent in Peri od 2 (Visit 10).
All echocardi ograms will be transferred to a cent ral imaging laboratory  designated by  Lilly .
Acardi ologist at the central imaging laboratory  will then conduct a full review on the 
echocardiogram. All data fro m the central  review will be provided to Lilly  for analy tical and 
study  report purposes. 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 44
LY45019010.4.2. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requi rements that m ay be less stringent.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study  drug or drug 
delivery  system shoul d be reported .  Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for 
regul atory  reporting and drug safet y evaluat ion.
Study  site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing 
condi tions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in 
the study .
After the informed consent document (ICD) is signed, site personnel will record any change in 
the condi tion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any  AEs.  All AEs related to protocol  
procedures are reported to Lilly or designee.
Any clinically  significant findings from physical examinat ions (including eye examinat ions), 
ECGs, labs, vital sign measurements, or other procedures that result in a diagnosis should be 
reported to Lilly  or its designee.
In addit ion, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of study drug must be 
reported to Lilly  or its designee via electronic data entry .
Invest igators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potenti al 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, study  drug, and/or drug delivery  system  via 
electroni c data entry .
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to L illy or its designee via electronic data entry the circumstances 
and data leading to any  such dosage reducti on or discontinuat ion of treatm ent.
10.4.3. Serious Adverse Events
Previously  planned (pri or to si gning of ICD) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unl ess the 
underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study .
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of  any serious adverse event (SAE) within 
24hours of invest igator awareness of the event via a Sponsor -approved method.   Alerts issued 
via tel ephone are to be immediately  followed wi th official notification on study -specific SAE 
forms.  An SAE is any AE fro m this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcomes:
death 
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
congenital ano maly/birth defect
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 45
LY450190considered significant by  the invest igator for any other reason
Important m edical events that may not r esult in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi talizati on may  be considered seri ous adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgi cal interventi on to prev ent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Serious adverse events occurring after a patient has taken the last dose of study  drug will be 
collected for 30 days after the l ast dose of study  drug, regardl ess of the invest igator’s opinio n of 
causat ion.  Thereafter, SAEs are not required to be reported unless the invest igator feels the 
events were related to either study  drug, drug delivery  system , or a protocol  procedure.
10.4.4. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly clinical pharmaco logist or clinical research physicia n will  monitor saf ety data 
throughout the course of the study .  In addit ion, a Safet y Moni toring Committee will undertake 
periodic reviews of the data, as outlined in the Safety  Moni toring Committee’s charter.
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mand ated by  com pany procedures, and will review 
trends, laboratory  analy tes, and AEs at peri odic intervals .  The Lilly clinical research physician 
will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally  independent Gl obal Pat ient Safet y 
therapeuti c area physici an or clinical scient ist, and review trends and laboratory  analy tes.
10.4.5. Complaint Handling
Lilly co llects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical trials 
in order to ensure the safet y of study  parti cipants, mo nitor qualit y,and to facilitate process and 
product improvements.
Com plaint s related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant drugs/drug delivery  system s 
are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package 
insert.
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion of the product complaint reported and any 
associated AEs using the study -specific co mplaint forms provided for this purpose
faxing the completed product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lilly or i ts 
designee
If the invest igator is asked to return the product for invest igation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.
10.5. Appropriateness and Consistency of Measurements
The AE profile o f tadalafil taken as needed or once daily in patients with ED is similar to that in 
patients wi th PAH .  The current safet y measures shoul d be adequate to evaluate safet y concerns 
of tadal afil administered once daily  in the treatm ent of PAH in pediatric pat ients.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 46
LY45019010.6. Compliance
Every  attem pt will be m ade to sel ect pati ents who have the abilit y to understand and co mply with

may be used in the pharmacokinetic andsafet y analyses as quant itative or classificat ion 
variables.
12.1.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses
12.1.4.1. Noncompartmental Pharmacokinetic Anal yses
Evaluat ion of individual pro files during the study  will be based on PK parameter estimates 
calculated by standard noncompartmental methods of analysis .  The purpose of these analyses 
will be to evaluate dose escalations in individual patients, and to evaluate (as data become 
available) the appropriateness of the starting doses listed in Table LVIG. 9.1.  The primary 
param eters for this evaluat ion will be area under the curve of concentration versus time (AUC)
and Cmax.  
Other noncompart mental parameters m ay be reported if appropri ate.
12.1.4.2. Popul ation Pharmacokinetic (PopPK) Analysis
Pharmacokinet ic data will be analyzed using an appropriate populat ion-based method across all 
patients at the end of the study , and also across all Middle -weight and available Heavy -weight 
patients at the time of the SMC evaluat ion to proceed with dosing in the Light -weight cohort .  
The purpose of the PopPK analysis is to characterize tadalafil PK across the range of body  
weights and ages enrolled in the study  and in each cohort; to evaluate the effect of various 
covar iates such as age, body  weight, sex, and ERA use on tadalafil exposure; and to predict 
appropriate dose(s) in subsequent pediatric studies of tadalafil .  A one compartment model has 
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 50
LY450190been shown to be suitable for data in adults, and will be used in pediatri c pat ients if also shown 
to be suitable for the data collected during the study .  The appropri ateness of other models may 
also be explored .  Details regarding the PopPK analysis will be described in a separate analysis 
plan.
12.1.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Not ap plicable.
12.1.6. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Not Applicable.
12.1.7. Safety Analyses
12.1.7.1. Clinical Evaluation of Safety
All study  drug and protocol procedure AEs will be listed, and if the frequency  of events all ows, 
safet y data will be summarized using descripti ve methodol ogy.
The incidence of symptoms for each treatment will be presented by  severi ty and by associ ation 
with study  drug as perceived by the invest igator .  Symptom s reported to occur prior to 
enrollment will be dist inguished from those reported as new or increased in severit y during the 
study .  Each symptom will be classified by the most suitable term fro m the medical  regulatory  
dictionary.
12.1.7.2. Statistical Evaluation of Safety
Safety param eters will  be listed and summarized overall and by  weight cohort.  Safety 
param eters to be assessed include AEs, safet y lab param eters, vi tal signs, physical examinat ion 
data, body  weight, hei ght, WHO funct ional class, IQ, Tanner score, 6MW test results, and ECG 
data.  Serious adverse events including deaths and discontinu ations due to adverse events will be 
summarized by  weight cohort wi th counts of the number of patients and percentages.  A 
summary of all treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) will be presented by system organ 
class and preferred term.  The frequency an d percentage of TEAE swill be presented for each
weight cohort.  Continuous laboratory data will be summarized by weight cohort and visit .  
Addit ional analysis will be performed if warranted upon review of the data.
12.1.8. Exploratory Analyses
Palatabili ty questi onnai re data and NT-Pro-BNP collected during the study  will be summarized. 
Changes fro m baseline to endpoint (defined as the end of the first 3 months of treatment in 
Period 2) in hemodynamic parameters (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursio n, eccentricit y 
index, pericardial effusio n, maximal tri cuspi d regurgi tant vel ocity) collected via echocardiogram 
will be summarized. 
12.2. Interim Analyses
Interim analyses are planned for this study .
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 51
LY450190Study  sites will receive informat ion about interim results ONLY if they need to know for the 
safet y of their pati ent or for dose escal ation.
If an addit ional unplanned interim analysis is deemed necessary , the Lilly  clinical research 
scientist or CRP/invest igator will cons ult with the appropriate m edical di rector or desi gnee to 
determine if it is necessary to amend the protocol.
12.2.1. Individual Dose Escalation Analysis
The purpose of these analyses will be to evaluate dose escalat ions in individual pat ientsforthe 
appropriatene ss of the high doses listed in Table LVIG. 9.1
Invest igator -level clinical data and lab reports regarding AEs, clinical signs and abnormal 
laboratory  tests, and PK results will be reviewed by  the sponsor, the sponsor designee, and 
investigator to support decisio ns to escalate to the high dose level for each patient without 
QA/QC or output fro m the Sponsor’s database.  The specifics about the timing of the interim 
analyses and the procedures for deciding the next dose are described in the Study Design sect ion 
of the protocol.
12.2.2. Cohort Analysis
The purpose of the PopPK analysis is to characterize tadalafil PK across the range of body  
weights and ages of patien ts enrolled in the study  and in each cohort; to evaluate the effect of 
various covariates such as age, body  weight, sex, and ERA use on tadalafil exposure; and to 
predi ct appropri ate dose(s) in subsequent pediatric studies of tadalafil .
These analyses will take pl ace after 5 Mi ddle-weight cohort pati ents have co mpleted Period1, 
and prior to the Light -weight cohort patients enro lling into the study .  
The SMC will review all 
available study  data, including both safet y and PK data, and recommend tadalafil dos e levels for 
the Light-weight cohort.  A similar review will occur when 5 patients fro m the Heavy -weight 
cohort have completed Period 1 of Study  LVIG. Addit ionally , the SMC will review all available 
study  data after the complet ion of the Light -weight coh ort and at least annually until the end of 
the study .

Blood Pressure Collection Protocol
According to the American Heart Associat ion (AHA) blood pressure is most conveniently 
measured in chi ldren by  the auscul tation method using a standard mercury  sphygm omanometer.  
Therefore, the invest igation sites will be encouraged to use this method rather than automated 
devices .  An exception is allowed in the case o f young infants in whom auscultation is difficult 
and in intensive care settings where frequent measurements are needed.
Correct blood pressure measurement in children requires a cuff which is appropriate for the size 
of the child’s upper arm .  This will require a cuff bladder that covers 80% of the 100% of the 
circumference of the arm .  Thus the recommended size for infants is 6 ×12 cm  and the 
recommended size for older children is 9× 18 cm .  A standard adult cuff, a large adult cuff and a 
thigh cuff for l eg bl ood pressure m easurement and for u se in children with very large arms 
shoul d also be available.
It is preferred that the children should be in a supine position.  The interpretation of diastolic and 
systolic measurements is left to the discret ion of the invest igator .

for Conduct of Un -encouraged
6-Minute Walk Test
(modified fro m Am J Respir Crit Care Med . 2002;166:111 -117).
The test should be conducted along a long, flat, enclosed corridor with a hard surface that is 
seldom traveled
.  If weather permits, the test may be conducted outdoors .  The corridor must be 
as qui et as possible while the test is underway to minimize external interference .  The distance 
that the patient has to walk before changing directions is 30 meters in length , so as not to 
artificially redu ce the di stance wal ked during the test .  The length of the corridor should be 
marked every  3 meters and turnaround points should be marked with a bright ly colored cone .  A 
starting line, which marks the beginning and end of each 60 -meter lap, shoul d be mar ked on the 
floor wi th brightly co lored tape.
1) Before starti ng the test, record all pertinent information surrounding the test, 
i.e., starting locat ion, length of hallway, direct ion the subject will be walking, 
time of test, patient’s general condit ion/feeling on the day  of the test, and any 
other physical or medical informat ion that m ay potent ially influence the 
resul ts of the test.
2) Instruct the patient as fo llows:
“The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes.  You will walk bac k 
and forth in this hallway .  Six minutes is a long time to walk, so y ou will be exerting 
yourself .  You will probably  get out of breath or become exhausted .  You are 
permitted to slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary .  You m ay lean against the 
wall while rest ing, but resume walking as soon as you are able .  You will be walking 
back and forth around the cones .  You should pivo t briskly around the cones and 
continue back the other way  without hesi tation.  No w I’m going to show you.  Please 
watch the w ay I turn wi thout hesi tation.”
(Dem onstrate by  walking one l ap yourself .  Wal k and pivot around a cone briskly.)
“Are y ou ready  to do that? I am going to use this counter to keep track of the number 
of laps y ou com plete .  I will click it each t ime you turn around at this starting line .  
Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE for 6 minutes , but don’t 
run or jog.
Start now, or whenever y ou are ready .”
3) Have the pat ient stand at the starting po int.  Simultaneously, give the patient a 
signal to start wal king as quickly  as possible, record the start time, and 
continue timing for the 6 -minute period.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 64
LY450190Do not talk to any one during the walk .  Use an even tone of vo ice when using the standard 
phrases of encouragement .  Watch the patient .  Do not get distracted and lose count of the laps .  
Each time the participant returns to the starting line, click the lap counter once (or mark the lap 
on the worksheet) .  Let the participant see you do it.  Exaggerate the click using body  language, 
like using a s topwatch at a race.
After the first minute, tell the patient the fo llowing (in even tones): “You are doing well .  You 
have 5 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing: “Keep up the good 
work .  You have 4 minut esto go.”
When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing: “You are doing well .  
You are halfway done.”
When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the fo llowing: “Keep up the good 
work .  You have only 2 minutes left.”
When the timer shows 1 minute remaining, tell the patient: “You are doing well .  You have only  
1 minute to go.”
Do not use other words of encouragement (or body language to speed up).
If the patient stops walking during the test and needs a rest, s ay this: “You can lean against the 
wall if y ou woul d like: then continue walking whenever y ou feel able.” Do not stop the timer .  If 
the pati ent stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to continue (or y ou deci de that they  
shoul d not continue), wheel the chai r over f or the pati ent to si t on, di scont inue the walk, and note 
on the worksheet the distance, the time stopped, and the reason for stopping prematurely.
When the timer is 15 seconds fro m completion, say  this: “In a m oment I’m  going to tell y ou to
stop.  When I do, just stop right where you are and I will co me to y ou.”
When the timing of the 6 -minute period is complete, the patient should be instructed to stop 
walking and the time recorded .  The patient must not move the final locat ion unt il the pe rson 
conducting the test marks that location.
Once the pat ient’s final location has been marked, allow the patient to leave the test course.
Measure the distance fro m the starting point tothe final locat ion and calculate the distance 
walked as foll ows:
Distance walked = (number of “laps” completed) x (length of 1 “lap” in meters) + (distance of 
any partial lap).
Record the distance walked by  the pat ient.

Protocol A mendment H6D-MC-LVIG(d )Summary  
A Multiple A scending Dose Study  of Tadalafil to A ssess 
thePharmacokinetics and Safety  in a Pediatric Population 
with Pulmonary  Arterial Hy pertension
Overview
Protocol  H6D -MC-LVIG, A Mult iple Ascending Dose Study  of Tadalafil to Assess the 
Pharmacokinet ics and Safet y in a Pediatric Populatio n with Pulm onary  Arterial Hypertensio n,
has been amended.  The new protocol is indicated by  Amendment( d) and will be used to conduct 
the study  in place of any preceding versio n of the protocol .
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as follows:
The wo r
ding in the S ummary of Study Design (Section 7.1) has been changed to provide the 
minimum number of completers ≤6 years of age and the minimum number of completers 
≤2years of age; the maximum number that was included in the previous versio n of the 
protocol (“ but not more than 4 patients ” and “ but not more than 3 patients ,” respectively ) has 
been deleted.
  This modification will leverage the potential additional patient enrollment in 
this age group to better understand the PK and safety.
Guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat, were added as concomitant medicines that 
are excluded and should prevent a pati ent from enrolling in the study.  The combination of 
guanylate cyclase stimulators and tadalafil could suddenly cause a drop in blood pressure 
which may result in dizziness or fainting.  Therefore, e xclusion criterion [37] has been added 
to exclude any patients who are taking guanylate cyclase stimulators , such as riociguat.  Also, 
riociguat was added to Section
 9.6(Concomitant Therapy ) as a concomitant medicine that 
would prevent a pati ent from enrolling in the study.
Text in Section 8.2.2 (Discontinuation of Individual Patients) has been changed to align with 
the current required language related to criteria for enrollment required per Lilly SEQS /MQS .
Text in the footnote section of the Study Schedule (Attachment 1 ) has been modified for 
clarification of the beginning of Period 2.
Corrected typos and clarified various other minor items in the protocol.

2.Synopsis
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion andExclusion
Patients are not eligible to be included in the study if they  meet any  ofthe following exclusio n 
criteriaexclusion criteria :
[14]  Concurrent PDE -5 inhibitor therapy ( such as sildenafil or vardenafil) or has received PDE -
5inhibitor therapy  within 24 hours prior to the first study  drug dosing ( baseline visit).
[
23]  Have sever e renal  insufficiency, defined as receiving renal dialysis or having a measured or 
estimated creatinine clearance (CC) 30mL/min/1.73 m2(Schwartz Formula):
All Females and Pre -adolescent Males:
Ccr (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.55 × Height (cm) / SCr (mg/dL)
Adolescent Mal es:
Ccr (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.70 × Height (cm) / SCr (mg/dL)
Where C cris Creatinine Clearance and S Cris Serum Creat inine
[37]  Currently  receiving treatm ent wi th soluble guanylate cy clase st imulator therapy  (such as 
riociguat).   Exclusio n criteria [37] has been added.
7.1.  Summary of Study Design
…  Of the 15 completers, at least 3 , but not more than 4 patients will  be ≤6 years of age and at 
least 2 , but not more than 3 patients will  be ≤2 years of age.
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 67
LY4501907.2.  Discussion of De sign and Control
…  The concomitant use of another PDE -5inhibit or (for example , sildenafil ) or soluble 
guanylate cy clase st imulator (for example, riociguat) is prohibited during the study .  Subjects 
receiving another PDE -5inhibitor will be required to discont inue the medicat ion at l east 
24hours prior to the baseline visit (Visit 2), which should suffice to allow for sy stemic 
eliminat ion of the PDE -5inhibitor ( that is, at least 5 half -lives of the drug).
8.1.2.  Exclusio n Criteria
[14]  Concurrent PDE -5 inhibitor therapy ( such as sildenafil or vardenafil) or has received PDE -
5inhibitor therapy  within 24 hours prior to the first study  drug dosing ( baseline visit).
[23]  Have severe renal insufficiency, defined as recei ving renal  dialysis or having a measured or 
estimated creatinine clearance (CC) 30mL/min/1.73 m2(Schwartz Formula):
All Females and Pre -adolescent Males :
Ccr(mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.55 ×Height (cm ) / S Cr(mg/dL)
Adolescent Mal es:
Ccr(mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.70 ×Height (cm ) / S Cr(mg/dL)
Where C cris Creatinine Clearance and S Cris Serum Creat inine
[37]  Currently receiving treatment with soluble guanylate cy clase st imulator therapy  (such as 
riociguat).   Exclusio n criteria [37] has been added.
8.1.3 .  Rationale for Inclusion and Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates
Exclusio n criteria and [30], [3 1], and [35] are in place to prevent a previously enro lled patient 
from re-entering the study  that m ay have al ready  had study  medicat ion.  Thi s woul d confound 
the analysis.
Exclusio n criteria [32] isin place to assure that the patients can take the medicat ion in the forms 
that are available in this trial.
Exclusio n criteria [33] and [3 4] are in place to prevent possible study  bias from  close relati ons.
Exclusio n criteria [37] is in place to protect the patient since the combinat ion of PDE5 inhibitors 
and guanylate cy clase stimulators, such as riociguat may lead to symptomat ic hypotension.
8.2.2 .  Discontinuation of Individual Patients
The cri teria for enrollment must be fo llowed explici tly.  If a pati ent who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertent ly enro lled, that patient is discont inued fro m the study , and Lilly  
H6D-MC-LVIG (d)Clinical Protocol Page 68
LY450190or its desi gnee m ust be contacted. If the invest igator site ident ifies a patient wh o did not m eet 
enrollment criteria and who was inadvertently enrolled, the sponsor must be notified.  If the 
sponsor i dentifies a patient who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertent ly 
enrolled, the invest igator site will be notified.  A di scussion must occur between the Lilly clinical 
pharmaco logist or clinical research physician and the invest igator to determine whether the 
patient may  cont inue in the study , with or wi thout investi gational product.   Inadvertent ly 
enrolled patients may be m aintained in the study  and on investi gational product when the 
investigator and Lilly clinical pharmacologist or clinical research physician agree it is medically 
appropriate for that patient .  The patient may not continue in the study  with or wi thout 
investigational product if the Lilly  clinical  pharmacol ogist or clinical research physician does not 
agree wi th the invest igator’s determinat ion that it is m edically appropriate for the patientto 
continue.  The invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the Lilly clinical 
pharmaco logist or clinical research physician to allow the inadvertent ly enrolled pat ient to 
continue in the study  with or wi thout invest igational product.
8.2.2.1 .  Early Discontinuation from Study
If Exclusio n Cri terion [18], [19], [20], [22 through 28], [3 2], or [36], or [37] is 
observed, or develops, after entry  or enrollment .  In this case, the patient will be 
discontinued fro m the drug/study  at the next visit or sooner in the event of a 
safet y exclusi on cri terion.
oExcept ion: A patient receiving an ERA who develops an AST or ALT >3 times 
upper limit of normal may  remain in the study , but m ust have ERA dosage 
adjustm ents and m onitoring that are consistent with the adult recommendations in 
the respective ERA labels.
9.6.  Concomit ant Therapy
Medicines and therapies that would prevent a patient fro m enrolling in the study are ident ified in 
the exclusio n sect ion of this protocol (see Section8.1.2 ), such as:
Prostacy clin or i ts anal ogues.
Concurrent PDE -5 inhibitor (other than study medication)
Nitrates
Doxazosin or Other cancer chemotherapy
Antiretrovi ral therapy (protease inhibitors), systemic ketoconazole, or sy stemic 
itracon azole.
Potent sy stemic CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers

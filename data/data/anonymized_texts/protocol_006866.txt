2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
Combination therapy (surgery/chemotherapy/radiation) has significantly improved long- term 
survival for men and women with rectal cancer.
1, 2 However, cancer survival brings common and 
feared treatment -related side effects such as irreversible bowel dysfunction.  Bowel dysfunction is 
associated with frequent and erratic bowel movements, fecal incontinence, soiling, gas, bloating, 
and oscillations between diarrhea and constipation. Our previous observational research have 
found that bowel dysfunction occurs regardless of the type of surgery and ostomy status (with or 
without a permanent ostomy), and results in reduced social activities, poor social well -being, and 
decrements in quality of life (QOL).3-7 Additionally, bowel dysfunction is a significant barrier to 
survivor adoption of dietary guidelines for cancer survivorship.8,9 
 
One promising approach for bowel symptom control is diet modifications . In our previous research 
(N=1 ,057), diet modification was the most consistently reported self -care strategy used by long-
term (>5 years) rectal cancer survivors.3 The ability to successfully manage bowel symptoms 
results in improved QOL; however, the choice of diet modifications varied tremendously, and was 
often based on a trial -and-error approach without structured coaching that is grounded in theory -
based strategies. This resulted in inconsistent efficacy , unnecessary delays in symptom 
improvement and, for some, avoidance of cancer preventive foods for health promotion after cancer .
3 While registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) provide the expertise to meet this challenge, 
evidence shows that even in comprehensive cancer centers RDN services are not readily available. Current patient -to-RDN ratios exceed 1000:1.
10, 11 Alternative, scalable approaches are essential 
to meet the growing demand.

Rectal Cancer as a Unique Cancer Diagnosis. Nearly  1.2 million individuals are living with a 
history of colorectal cancer in the United States; it is the third largest cancer survivorship 
population.2 Approximately 68% of individuals with a history of rectal cancer  are long- term (> 5 
years) survivors.2, 12 The proportion of rectal cancer  diagnosed in adults ≤  55 years doubled from 
14.6% to 29.5% in the last 40 years.13 The observed rise of rectal cancer  in younger populations is 
likely partially fueled by lifestyle factors, including obesity and diet quality.14 Rectal cancer  has been 
largely ignored in terms of evaluation and symptom management, secondary to combining colon and rectal cancer statistics, despite highly different etiologies, treatments, symptoms and survival trajectories.
15  
 
QOL in rectal cancer  survivors is influenced by treatment, which involves the sequenced 
combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. The two most common surgical 
procedures  include 1) abdominoperineal resection (APR), a resection of the rectum/anus with the 
creation of a permanent ostomy; and 2) low anterior resection (LAR) with rectal anastomosis 
(rejoining of healthy ends of the bowel).16 For ease, we refer to the two techniques as “permanent 
ostomy” or “anastomosis, respectively. In 90% of survivors who undergo low -mid rectum resection, 
an anastomosis is accompanied by a temporary (“protective”) diverting ileostomy.17  
 
Bowel Function as a Driver of QOL. Bowel dysfunction is one of the most common and feared long-term symptoms of rectal cancer  treatment. 
18-23 For anastomosis patients, the term “anterior 
resection syndrome” describes the constellation of postoperative bowel symptoms; these include 
fecal incontinence, frequency, urgency, sense of incomplete fecal evacuation, and flatulence.24-27 
Bowel dysfunction significantly affect QOL in rectal cancer  survivors.28-32 Our previous 
observational research suggests that bowel control varies greatly, and that 27% to 56% of survivors report moderate to severe bowel dysfunction at 1- year post -treatment.
33-38 Consequently, rectal 
cancer  survivors must adjust psychologically and behaviorally to bowel dysfunction. Importantly, 
bowel symptoms are modifiable, underscoring the need to identify and test interventions that contribute to symptom relief.  
 
Empirically -based interventions to manage bowel dysfunction are lacking. The American Cancer 
Society Colorectal Cancer Survivorship guidelines categorized the evidence for bowel dysfunction 
interventions at the lowest level (case studies or reports only).
39 In the absence of evidence- based 
interventions, survivors use trial -and-error self -care strategies to manage bowel symptoms. 
Functional self -care strategies include diet modifications, medications/supplements, and protective 
pads/diapers.40 Social activity alterations (e.g. scheduling social outings around bowel patterns, 
intentional isolation) are often used to avoid bowel accidents in public.41  
 
Dietary Modification as a Scalable, Empirically -Based Approach for Bowel Symptom 
Management. Diet modifications are one of the most common self -care strategies to manage 
bowel symptoms.42-44 Beyond symptom management, a healthy diet is associated with decreased 
recurrence and improved survival after rectal cancer .45-47 Specifically, cancer survivors are advised 
to eat a plant -based diet, avoid red and processed meats, consume adequate fiber (25- 30 grams), 
limit animal fat intake, and moderate or no alcohol consumption.9 Yet, current dietary guidance for 
cancer survivorship may be difficult to achieve in symptomatic rectal cancer  patients. Survivors 
often avoid foods, including vegetables, fruits and whole grains, because of a perceived risk of 
bowel problems.3  Behavioral approaches in the context of cancer survivorship should consider 
promotion of healthy eating behaviors to enhance QOL and survivorship, while concurrently 
identifying and addressing barriers to adoption of such eating patterns. For rectal cancer  survivors 
this should include the modification of food selections that impact bowel symptoms. Left on their own,  survivors may select approaches that delay symptom resolution and/or reduce their diet 
quality.  
 
While professional dietetic services would be one solution to support bowel symptom management, recent reports describe the dearth of available registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN) and nutrition 
services available to survivors, even at comprehensive cancer centers.
10 Furthermore, bowel 
symptom characteristics are dynamic in terms of frequency and severity, suggesting that effective 
interventions will need to be flexible in meeting individual needs. Clinic -based counseling that 
 S1820  
  Page 10 
Version Date 03/03/2023  
 
requires on- site appointments, travel, with limited time availability, increases barriers to access for 
rectal cancer survivors.11 Less burdensome approaches are needed.  
 
Sex-Specific Differences in Telephone -Based Lifestyle Behavior Interventions. Although 
behavior change remains a challenge for all cancer survivors, the current literature suggest that 
men may respond differently to lifestyle behavior interventions compared to women.48 Reasons for 
these differences include 1) misperception of the need for behavior change49; 2) lack of reporting 
of attempts to change behaviors50; 3) lack of interest in undertaking behavior change51; and 4) 
perception that behavior change interventions are unappealing or designed to meet the needs of 
women.52 Current evidence suggesting sex -specific variance in telephonic and/or multimodal 
behavioral counseling in cancer survivorship is limited.  
 
Motivational Interviewing -Based Interventions for Cancer Symptom Management and 
Lifestyle Behaviors. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a patient -centered approach to facilitate 
behavior change.53 MI is widely used to address a variety of behavioral targets, with demonstrated 
success in diet, smoking cessation, exercise and other health behaviors. A recent systematic 
review by Spencer and Wheeler evaluated the effectiveness of MI for lifestyle behavior change in 
cancer patients; the review concluded that MI was successful in enhancing healthy diet behaviors, 
such as increasing the number of servings of fruits and vegetables, including RC survivors.54 MI 
was also successful in managing cancer symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, distress, and lymphedema.
55-58    
 
Despite the current evidence that supports the efficacy of MI -based interventions, cancer survivors 
continue to struggle with healthy behaviors and symptom management. Approaches that are 
grounded in new and existing knowl edge is needed. A novel method of combining skills training 
and motivational strategies is the Motivation and Problem Solving (MAPS) approach. MAPS incorporate  social cognitive strategies (coping and problem- solving skills) within an overarching MI 
framework. Its innovation lies in a design that considers  all individuals regardless of their readiness 
for behavior change. Instead of conceptualizing behavior change as phases and stages, MAPS is 
novel in conceptualizing motivation for behavior change as contextual, fluid, and dynamically 
fluctuating in a moment to moment basis.
59 MAPS was initially developed for substance abuse and 
tobacco dependence, and has been demonstrated to be effective in RCTs of smoking cessation.59  
 
Rationale: Recent trends suggest that rates of rectal cancer  are increasing, particularly in adults 
≤55 years.13 These trends suggest that the number of younger rectal cancer  survivors living with 
bowel dysfunction will continue to rise in years to come. Furthermore, s ignificant QOL issues are 
associated with bow el symptoms after rectal cancer  treatment and there is a lack of evidence-
based interventions to support symptom management concurrent with achievement of dietary survivorship guidance. Current evidence suggests that cancer survivors fall short in achieving 
national survivorship diet guidelines.
8 These trends will continue, unless effective interventions are 
developed, tested, and disseminated. T here is also a lack of empirical data on sex -specific 
differences in behavioral intervention uptake and response. Importantl y, this trial will explore 
efficacy by sex, affording opportunities to tailor the intervention as justified by the sex -specific data 
collected. Finally, there is a need to develop approaches that are scalable to a larger number of cancer survivors.  
 
Preliminary Work :  As the foundation of this trial we assessed survivors’ dietary and behavioral 
modifications for bowel control in two cohorts of rectal cancer survivors (N=919).
3 Diet modifications 
were common, regardless of ostomy status (40.5% ostomy, 42.7% anastomosis). Most  survivors 
report some reduction in symptoms over 12 months. Some never reported symptom resolution (18.9% ostomy, 11.3% anastomosis). Lack of symptom resolution was associated with lower QOL 
(p<.0001). Diet modifications and meal -related behaviors were the most comm on strategy for  bowel 
control (13 focus groups, N=63).  A second analysis described the specific bowel symptoms that 
were mitigated or exacerbated by diet modifications (N=577). Fruits and vegetables were helpful in mitigating constipation, obstruction, frequency, and improving predictability. Survivors also 
endorsed water, fiber -rich foods, cereal, and bread as helpful for bowel symptoms. Troublesome 
foods included vegetables, dairy, fruits, protein, fried foods, spices/spicy food, nuts, and sweets. 
These foods reportedl y increased diarrhea, gas, and urgency.

A single group, pre- post intervention study was initiated to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability 
of AIMS -RC in 10 rectal cancer  survivors.60 A total of 20 patients were eligible and were invited to 
participate. Of these, 3 declined participation (no time, being overwhelmed); 16 consented (average 
of four per month). Of these, six were lost to follow -up after consent. A process evaluation 
suggested that consent by the study CRA, largely independent of clinic personnel, may have 
contributed to higher early loss to follow -up. Of the remaining 10 participants,  eight completed the 
sessions. One participant completed 4 sessions and declined further participation.  Another completed 5 sessions, suffering a major life event that precluded further engagement.  Mean age 
was 57 ± 2.55 years, and the majority were female (80%). Four had anastomosis, 3 had a 
temporary ostomy and re- anastomosis, and 2 had a permanent ostomy. Average length of the 
telephone sessions was approximately 30 minutes. The majority of participants found the 
intervention helpful and acceptable. Safety data for a control intervention are not available as the 
study was a single group, pre- post intervention design with no control condition.  Of note, we did 
not experience any safety issues or concerns from patients in the pilot study.

7.3 Run- In Period  
 
Recruitment Strategies : All eligible patients will be screened and recruited by the 
enrollment site staff. All patients will be inform consented by enrollment site staff. A major 
source of direct recruitment at enrollment sites include direct referrals from surgical, 
medical oncology, radiation oncology clinics. For enrollment sites with an existing 
survivorshi p clinic  and/or ostomy clinics, potential patients can be recruited directly from 
survivorship care teams  and/or ostomy nurses . Additionally, patients will be recruited 
through colorectal cancer advocacy groups and SWOG Cancer Research Network patient advocate efforts. Recruitment strategies will be vetted with the SWOG Cancer Research Network Recruitment and Retention Committee in accordance with established guidelines 
and policies.  
 
All patients registered to Step 1 will be asked to complete the study run- in activities. The 
run-in pe riod and related activities are  designed to enhance patient participation in the 
study and enhance adherence to procedures in both randomization arms. The run- in period 
will range between 14-21 days  after Step 1 registration.  
 
NOTE: Sites will receive a supply of run- in packets after completing recruitment site 
training. If more run- in packets are needed, they can be requested by completing a form 
via the following link: http://j.mp/2EKjuEk
.  Each  run-in packet includes the following:  
 
1) BFI  (versions for both anastomosis and ostomy) ;  
2) 3-day food and symptom diary;  
3) written instructions and examples for the food and symptom diary;  4) Food Amounts Booklet (FAB) for 24- hour dietary recall;  
5) run- in-period calendar;  
6) postage paid envelope.  
 
Procedures for the run- in period are as follows:   
 
1. The site must consent the patient , verify eligibility (including the LARS for 
anastomosis patients)  and verify all baseline questionnaires  are complete 
(see Section 9.0 and Section 15.1
). Eligible patients will be registered to 
Step 1.  
 
Patients will receive a run- in packet by site staff. The sites will inform the 
patient to review  the packet at home and to expect a telephone call from 
the University of Arizona for instructions on using the packet. The site will 
write the patient’s full name on the cover page of the run- in packet, above 
the box for the SWOG patient ID. The University of Arizona staff member 
will provide the SWOG Patient ID to the patient during their first call.  
 
2. Site register patients to Step 1. Send S1820 P atient Contact Information 
form per Section 7.1a . 
 
3. Within 48 hours of receiving the S1820 Patient Contact Information form 
and receiving confirmation from the SDMC that the patient has been registered to Step 1 , a trained staff  member  from the University of Arizona 
will contact the patient via telephone. The University of Arizona staff 
member will provide run -in instructions and support to the patient on the 
use of the 3- day food/symptom diary , schedule the baseline 24- hour 
dietary recall , and answer any additional questions the patient may have 
about the study or the run- in packet materials.  The p atient will be 
instructed to complete the 3- day food/symptom diary within 5 days, and 
mail or email  (patient preference)  the diary back to the University of 
 S1820  
  Page 16  
Version Date 03/03/2023  
 
Arizona  within 5 days of completion.  The trained staff member will attempt 
to administer the BFI and the 24 hour dietary recall at this time or  schedule 
a more convenient time for the patient.   
 
4. Trained staff at the University of Arizona will review the returned diary and 
evaluate successful completion according to protocol standards.  
 
5. A trained staff member at the University of Arizona will call the patient to administer the BFI  and the 24- hour dietary recall .  
 
6. Trained staff at the University of Arizona will evaluate successful 
completion of the run- in period requirements  (“pass ” vs. “not pass ”) based 
on the criteria listed in Section 10.2 .  
 
7. The site will receive a secure email from the University of Arizona  
confirming the patient’s run- in completion  status ( “pass ” or “not pass ”). The 
site assesses the patient for eligibility for Step 2 registration within 5 days 
after receipt of that email  (Step 2 Eligibility  Assessment schema) . Patients 
eligible for Step 2 randomization must be registered within 5 days after 
receipt of the run- in status confirmation email. For p atients who will not be 
registered to Step 2, the site  must submit the S1820 Pre-Randomization 
Off Study form per Section 14.4.   ( See Section 18.5  for COVID -19-r elated 
exception.)

7.4 Bowel Symptom Management Assessment  
 
To obtain data on additional bowel symptom management and assess site standard of care 
bowel symptom treatment for each participant, sites must complete two questions in the 
S1820  Onstudy  Form (completed before Step 1 registration), and at each follow -up 
timepoint (Week 18 and Week 26) using the S1820  Follow -Up Form.   
 
7.5  Arm 1:  Intervention Arm (AIMS -RC) 
 
AIMS- RC sessions are targeted to begin  within 10 days of randomization and are delivered 
over approximately 17 weeks  via 10 telephone sessions that last 15-60 minutes each. (See 
Table 7.5 ). University of Arizona staff mails an AIMS- RC resource manual  to patients ; this 
is used during the sessions to guide discussions between the coach and patient s. Details 
on each of the sessions are provided in Appendix  18.2. 
 
The Intervention Arm (AIMS -RC) is delivered in addition  to standard of care for post -
treatment rectal cancer survivors. All patients will continue to receive standard care per their physician and care team’s direction at the enrollment sites. Our intent is not to replace 
or change standard care being provided.  
 
The AIMS -RC sessions are  centrally -administered via telephone by one trained health 
coach and one back -up coach (as needed only) from  the University of Arizona. The health 
coach will only be working with patients randomized to the Intervention Arm. The health 
coach has  experience with health coaching among cancer survivors and has been trained 
on rectal cancer -specific knowledge. The health coaches were jointly trained by Dr s. Sun, 
Thomson, and Crane; their delivery of the intervention will  be monitored by the Study Chair 
and Co- Chairs throughout the study.  
 
a. Motivational Text/Email Messaging  
 
Patients receive electronic communication messaging between scheduled  
telephone calls  after Session 6. Patients have the option of receiving the messages 
via smartphone text messaging (SMS) and/or email messaging.  The messages 
are specific  to the AIMS -RC intervention to support participant -specific bowel 
symptom management goals. Health coaches use the messages to provide 
support, promote diet behavior change and bowel symptom management, and to sustain participant engagement. Patients will receive three messages per week 
after Session 6, when calls move to every other week. The messaging ends after 
Session 10 (end of intervention) .  
 
b. Newsletters  
   Patients will receive quarterly  newsletters during the 17 weeks of telephone 
sessions. The newsletter is designed to sustain patient engagement throughout 
the 17 week intervention. The content will vary each month and will contain 
information to support diet modification skills. The health coaches will send 
newsletters to the participants.

7.6 Arm 2:  Attention Control Arm  
 
The Attention Control sessions begin within 10 days of randomization and are delivered 
over approximately 17  weeks  via 10 telephone sessions that last about 15-60 minutes each 
(see Table 7.6 ). University of Arizona staff mails a Health Education  resource manual to 
patients ; this is used during the sessions to guide discussions between the coach and 
patient s. Our choice of the attention control arm (Healthy Living Education) is based on our 
previous experience with the design of control conditions for behavioral interventions (i.e. 
GOG/NRG 225). The 10 topics are selected based on national survivorship guidelines on 
healthy living post -treatment for cancer survivors.  
 
The Attention Control Arm (Healthy Living Education) is delivered in addition  to standard 
of care for post -treatment rectal cancer survivors. All patients will continue to receive 
standard care per their physician and care team’s direction at the enrollment sites. Our 
intent is not to replace or change standard care being provided.  
 
The Attention Control sessions are centrally administered via telephone by one trained 
health coach and one back -up coach (as needed)  from the University of Arizona.  The 
health coach will only be working with patients randomized to the Attention Control Arm. 
The Attention Control Arm coaches  are different from the Intervention Arm coach es.  The 
health coach has experience with health coaching among cancer survivors and has been 
trained on rectal cancer -specific knowledge. They were jointly trained by Drs. Sun, 
Thomson, and Crane; their delivery of the Health Education program will be monitored by 
the Study Chair and Co- Chairs throughout the study.  
 
a. Text/Email Messaging  
 
Patients receive electronic communication messaging between scheduled 
telephone calls  after Session 6. Patients have the option of receiving the messages 
via short smartphone text messaging (SMS) and/or email messaging. T he 
messages are used for retention purposes only. They are standard ized messages 
containing information on the 10 topics listed in Table 7.6 . Patients  receive three 
messages per week beginning with Session 6 when calls move to every other 
week. The messaging will end after Session 10.  
 
b. Newsletters  
  
Patients will receive quarterly  newsletters during the 17 weeks of telephone 
sessions. The newsletters are designed to sustain patient engagement throughout 
the 17 week intervention. The content will vary each month and will contain 
information on the ten healthy living education topics  designed for the attention 
control condition.

10.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT ANALYSIS  
 
10.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint for this study is bowel function at 18 weeks  after randomization, as 
measured by Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Instrument  (BFI) 
total score.  
 
The BFI is a validated instrument that assesses bowel function in post-surgery rectal 
cancer  patients . Total scores  range from 18 to 90; higher scores indicate better bowel 
function. The responses are measured on a 5- point Likert scale, apart from the frequency 
of bowel movements item.61, 62 There are separate versions for patients with ostomy (17 
items) and anastomosis ( 20 items) . The BFI total score was  validated in an observational  
cohort of post -surgery rectal cancer patients , but only in those with anastomosis  not 
ostomies .61 The results of a recent confirmatory factor analysis of data from that cohort 
showed that  an eight -item BFI  total score that excludes  frequency items i s valid and reliable 
and c an apply to people with ostomy or anastomosis .92  Bowel function is  assessed during 
the run- in (this is the baseline measure) , and at Week 1 8 and Week 26  via telephone 
interview  by the University of Arizona.  
 
   
10.2 Exploratory  Endpoints  
 
a. Bowel function: Dietary, Urgency, Frequency  
 The BFI has three subscale s: a four -item Dietary subscale ( score range of 4–20), 
a four -item Urgency subscale (4 –20), and a 6- item Frequency subscale (6– 30); 
higher scores indicate better bowel function. The responses are measured on a 5-point Likert scale, apart from the frequency of bowel movements item.
61, 62 
 
b. Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS)  
 
Lower anterior resection  syndrome is measured using the LARS Score , a validated  
5-item instrument that evaluates  severe long- term bowel dysfunction in post -
surgery rectal cancer patients. 33 Scores range from 0 to 42 points . Scores are 
categorized into three groups: no LARS (0- 20), minor LARS (21- 29), and major 
LARS (30 -42).63-65 This instrument  will only be used with anastomosis patients. 
LARS is assessed prior to Step 1 registration (baseline) , Week 1 8 and Week 2 6. 
 
c. Quality of Life 
 
The City of Hope- Quality of Life- Colorectal Cancer (COH -QOL -CRC)  is a validated 
instrument that assesses overal l quality of life in post -surgery colorectal cancer 
patients. It evaluates  overall QOL and four QOL dimensions: physical, 
psychological, social, and spiritual well -being. The overall score is calculated using 
all subscales, with a range of 0 to 10 ; higher  scores indicate higher quality of life. 
Subscales scores are also scaled from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher 
quality of life in that domain.66 There are separate versions for patients with ostomy 
(43 items) and anastomosis (35 items) . Quality of life is assessed prior to Step 1 
registration (baseline) , Week 18  and Week 2 6. 
 
d. Dietary Quality  
 Dietary quality is based on the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI -2015), which 
reflects the American Cancer Society dietary guidance for prevention and 
 S1820  
 Page 25  
 Version Date 03/03/2023  
 
 
survivorship (greater fruit, vegetable and grain intake, lower animal fat intake, 
greater fiber intake, and lower empty calorie intake that contributes to undesirable 
weight status).  Dietary quality scores  are calculated from the dietary recall data 
according to the HEI -2015 67-72 and adapted for restriction in alcohol intake. Scores 
range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher diet quality. Dietary quality is measured during the run- in period  (baseline) , Week 18 and Week 26. 
 
e. Motivation  
 
Motivation is measured using a 10-item scale assessing  motivation to change 
dietary behaviors in rectal cancer survivors  from the S1820 Reasons for Managing 
Bowel Health form. It was developed internally, based on the Reasons for Quitting 
(Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation) scale.73 Items are scored on a 5- point Likert 
scale, from 0 (“Not true at all ”) to 4 (“Extremely true”). The score is calculated by 
summing all responses; higher scores indicate higher motivation . Motivation is 
assessed prior to Step 1 registration (baseline) , and at  Week 1 8 and Week 26. 
 
f. Self-Efficacy 
 
Self-effica cy is measured using the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) Self -Efficacy  for Managing Symptoms – Short Form 
4a, a validated instrument that measur es confidence in one’s ability to successfully 
perform specific tasks or behaviors related to self-efficacy for managing symptoms. 
The four  items are scored on a 5- point Likert scale, from 1 ( “I am not at all 
confident ”) to 5 (“I am very confident ”). The overall score is calculated by summing 
all responses and converting to a PROMIS T -score ; higher scores indicate greater 
self-efficacy .74 Self-efficacy is assessed prior to Step 1 registration (baseline) , 
Week 18 and Week 26. 
 
g. Positive and Negative Affect  
 
Affect is measured using the 10 -item International Positive and Negative Affect 
Schedule Short Form  (I-PANAS -SF), a validated instrument  comprised of two 
mood scales: Positive Affec t (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) .75, 76 The scores are 
calculated by summing the responses  for positive and negative affect items 
separately. S cores range from 5 to 25, with  higher  scores on these scales indicate 
greater positive affect or negative affect, respectively.  Affect is assessed prior to 
Step 1 registration (baseline) , Week 1 8 and Week 2 6. 
 
h. Feasibility , adherence, retention, and acceptability  
 Feasibility , adherence, retention, and acceptability  are descriptive measures that 
will be used to characterize the successfulness of the intervention in this pilot trial 
and guide the study team in preparing for the Phase III trial. These measures are evaluated based on data obtained throughout the study period.  
 Feasibility is  measured by the percentage of patients who successfully complete 
(“pass ”) the run- in period  and are randomized. Successful  completion is  defined 
as meeting all five of the following meas ures:  
 1. Patient answers the telephone calls from trained staff at the University of 
Arizona . 
 
2. Patient completes 24- hour dietary recall  with trained staff from University 
of Arizona.  
 
 S1820  
 Page 26 
 Version Date 03/03/2023  
 
 
3. Patient completes the food and symptom diary with least 3 entries of any 
kind (food OR symptom) for 3 days (consecutive or not).  
 
4. Patient returns their food and symptom diary, by mail or email, to the 
University of Arizona within 14 days of completion.  
 
5. Patient completes the BFI with trained staff from University of Arizona.  
 
Adherence measures successful completion of intervention or attention control 
coaching calls. Adherence is defined as  completing all five of Sessions #1- 5 and 
at least three of Sessions #6- 10 within 18 weeks after randomization; patient s who 
do not meet this criterion  are classified as non-adherent .  
 
Retention is defined by completion of follow -up assessments  in Step 2, including 
those administered at follow -up site visits and the dietary recalls.  
 
Acceptability is measured for all participants using the Acceptability of Intervention 
measure (AIM)77. It is scored on a 5- point Likert scale from 1 (“completely 
disagree” ) to 5 (“completely agree” ). Acceptability is assessed at Week 18 and 
Week  26. 
 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
11.1 Primary Endpoint  and Sample Size  
 
The primary endpoint for this study is bowel function total score at 18 weeks  after 
randomization, as measured by the BFI. Thirty-seven patients per arm (74 total) 
will provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.5, bas ed on a two- sample t -
test with a 1-sided alpha=0.1. The effect size is justified by data from a study of 
post-surgery rectal cancer patients  with anastomosis , which gave a BFI SD 
estimate of 9.3 points61, 62, 78, and a clinically meaningful study arm difference of 
approximately 4.6 points as defined by the Sloan empirical rule effect size (defined as a mean difference of approximately 8% of BFI range) .
79 We assume that the 
0.5 SD effect size is similarly meaningful for the validated eight -item BFI  total 
score . 92  We will accrue additional patients to account for 7 % ineligibility and 15% 
attrition at 6 months, for a total accrual goal of 9 4 randomized patients .  
 
11.2 Primary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted in all eligible patients 
randomized to the study  with 18- week BFI data regardless of adherence to the 
coaching calls , according to a modified intention- to-treat principle. Study arm 
differences in BFI at 18 week s will be assessed by a  linear regression model as a 
function of randomization assignment, BFI baseline value, and stratification 
factors . Due to the low safety risks of this study, we will not perform an interim 
futility analys is. 
 
11.3 Other Analyses  
 
Given the modest size of this trial, the exploratory  endpoint analyses are 
considered hypothesis -generating. Study arm differences in BFI at 26 weeks  will 
be assessed by a linear regression model as a function of randomization assignment, BFI baseline value, and stratification factors. Other  continuous 
exploratory  outcomes at both 18 and 26 weeks  (BFI subscales, LARS, quality of 
life, dietary quality, motivation, self -efficacy, and positive/negative affect) will be 
assessed by a repeated measures linear regression model as a function of 
 S1820  
 Page 27  
 Version Date 03/03/2023  
 
 
randomization assignment, baseline value of the outcome, stratification factors, 
and visit. Robust standard errors will be estimated via generalized estimating 
equations to adjust for correlation between repeated outcome measures. The dependent variables will be transformed to approximate normality as appropriate.  
 Accrual rates and feasibility  will be summarized. Study arm differences in 
adherence and retention will be assessed by chi square tests. Study program 
acceptability will be compared across arms via t -test. 
 
Although the sample size provides limited statistical power for subgroup analyses, 
we will explore the impact of sex by reanalyzing all outcomes according to sex as 
feasible. The potential for differential intervention effects according to sex on the 
primary endpoint will also be considered.  
 To assess the sensitivity of intervention effects to the potential confounding factor of site -based symptom management, additional exploratory BFI models will adjust 
for such treatments used by participants at baseline and during the intervention.  
 
11.4 Accrual  
 
Based on a survey of sites represented at the SWOG Survivorship Committee, w e 
estimate availability of at least 600 potential ly eligible patients each year. If 75% of 
eligible patients registered to Step 1 will be randomized to Step 2, we anticipate registering 126 patients to Step 1 . Thus, we have set a target of registering 5-6 
patients per month to Step 1 to  allow for complete enrollment to Step 2 
(randomization) in approximately 2 years.  
 11.5 Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will oversee the conduct of the study.  The Committee consists of four members from outside of SWOG, 3 SWOG 
members, 3 non- voting representatives from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
and the Group Statistician (non- voting).  The members of this Committee will 
receive confidential reports every 6 months from the SWOG Statistics and Data 
Management Center , including CTCAE -graded symptom data,  and will meet at the 
Group's bi -annual meetings as necessary.  The Committee will be responsible for 
decisions regarding possible termination and/or early reporting of the study, based  
on accrual and feasibility.

13.2 CTEP Investigator Registration Procedures  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) policy 
require all individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored trials to register and to renew their 
registration annually. To register, all individuals must obtain a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access Management (IAM) account at https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam
. In addition, persons with a registration type of Investigator 
(IVR), Non -Physician Investigator (NPIVR), or Associate Plus (AP) (i.e., clinical site staff 
requiring write access to OPEN, Rave, or acting as a primary site contact) must complete their annual registration using CTEP’s web- based Registration and Credential Repository 
(RCR) at https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/rcr.    
RCR utilizes five person registration types.  
• IVR — MD, DO, or international equivalent;  
• NPIVR — advanced practice providers (e.g., NP or PA) or graduate level 
researchers (e.g., PhD);  
• AP — clinical site staff (e.g., RN or CRA) with data entry access to CTSU 
applications (e.g., Roster Update Management System ( RUMS), OPEN, 
Rave,);  
• Associate (A) — other clinical site staff involved in the conduct of NCI -
sponsored trials; and  
• Associate Basic (AB) — individuals (e.g., pharmaceutical company 
employees) with limited access to NCI -supported systems.  
 
RCR requires the following registration documents:

15.1 Administration of Questionnaires to Patients   
 
The primary outcome of this study is a PRO and all patient evaluations are based on PROs.  
 
a. Administration Timepoints  
 
1. The following data will be self -reported by the patient within 7 days prior 
to Step 1 registration. The data will be collected by enrollment site staff :  
 • LARS (anastomosis patients only)  – administered orally by site staff  
• Quality of Life (anastomosis or ostomy version)  
• PROMIS Self -Efficacy for Managing Symptoms – Short Form 4a  
• S1820 Reasons for Managing Bowel Health  
• Positive and Negative Affect Scale (I -PANAS- SF) 
• S1820 Baseline Questionnaire (anastomosis or ostomy version)  
 
Patient baseline questionnaires should be administered the same day the 
patient consents. Patients must be registered (Step 1) within 7 days after 
consent and completion of baseline questionnaires . * 
 *  See Section 18.5
 for COVID -19-related exception.  
 
2. The following data will be self -reported by the patient at Week 18 and 
Week 26 (Step 2) . The data will be collected by enrollment site staff :  
 
• LARS (anastomosis patients only)  
• Quality of Life (anastomosis or ostomy version)  
• PROMIS Self -Efficacy for Managing Symptoms – Short Form 4a  
• S1820 Reasons for Managing Bowel Health  
• Positive and Negative Affect Scale (I -PANAS- SF) 
• Acceptability of Intervention Measure  
 
The S1820 Cover Sheet for Patient -Completed Questionnaires must be  
submitted for each time point.  
 
Also see Section 14.0  for a list of questionnaires and submission times.  
 Note that the BFI and dietary recalls are conducted by the University of Arizona 
research staff; these do not require clinic engagement and are not listed here.  
 
b. Administration Instructions  
 
1. All questionnaires except the LARS will be self -administered; the LARS is 
administered orally by site staff.  Questionnaires are anticipated to require 45 minutes  to complete at baseline and 35  minutes at each follow -up time 
point. When a patient is randomized (registered to Step 2) to S1820 , a 
calendar may be made by the local site with dates of upcoming patient -
completed questionnaires noted and provided to the patient at their next visit. A copy of the planned questionnaire administration time points should 
be kept in the patient’s research record.  
 
2. Target follow -up assessment dates should be based on the date of Step 2 
randomization. A window of ± 14 days is allowed for each assessment to 
provide more flexibility in scheduling. If the patient visit and form 
 S1820

 Version Date 03/03/2023  
 
 
completion are not within the target window, all attempts should be made 
to complete the next assessment within the target follow -up assessment 
schedule per Section 15.1b  and Section 14.0.  
 
3. In order to minimize patient burden and streamline patient visits, it is 
preferable for questionnaires to be given to the patient at the clinical visit immediately prior to the study time point and to have the patient complete 
it at home and returned at the routine clinical visit coinciding with the study 
time point; however, the study staff should accommodate the patient’s preferences for filling out the questionnaires as described below. At time 
of consent, the patient should be provided with a copy of the forms for reference. If the participant chooses to complete questionnaire at home, research staff should provide a reminder (i.e., via phone call, text or email 
based on preference) to decrease the likelihood that the patient forgets to 
fill out the questionnaires.  
 
4. The research site should provide the patient with options for completing the questionnaires after the patient has reviewed them. The patient’s review may help them decide if they need information,  they do not have 
with them at their visit or they may need assistance from a family member or caregiver. The patient may also be more comfortable completing the questionnaire(s) at home. The options for the patient are as follows:  
 
Complete questionnaires at home.  Provide the patient with questionnaires in 
advance and instructions to return them to the site at the clinical visit corresponding 
to the study time point (e.g., give patient questionnaires 2 weeks in advance at a 
routine clinical visit). Review the returned questionnaires for completeness at the clinical visit and clarify answers while the patient is at the clinic. If the patient does 
not return the completed questionnaires as scheduled, the patient should complete 
the questionnaires at the clinical visit  or schedule a phone contact.  
 
Partially complete the questionnaires in the clinic or practice.  If due to illness, 
time or any reason the patient begins completing the questionnaires in the clinic or 
practice but then decides he/she cannot finish one or more questionnaire, make a 
photocopy of the incomplete questionnaire(s), give the patient the copy and keep 
the original in the patient’s research chart. Give the patient a pre- addressed 
stamped envelope to return the questionnaire(s) by mail to the clinic or practice, 
but also schedule a phone call with the patient 1 week later. If questionnaire(s) are 
returned (by mail or in person) within 1 week, use the scheduled phone call to 
clarify any missing or unclear responses (if applicable). If questionnaire(s) are not 
returned, use the scheduled phone call to complete the questionnaire(s) by phone 
interview.  
 
Complete questionnaires by phone interview.  If the patient is unable to come 
in for their clinical visits or questionnaires were not completed before or at the clinical visit, questionnaires may be completed by phone interview. Phone 
interviews should be scheduled within 1 week of the clinical visit corresponding to 
the study time point. The patient should be given a copy of blank forms (or partially completed, if applicable) so that the patient may look at a copy of the 
questionnaires while the staff conducts the interview. The date of the telephone 
interview is to be noted on the S1820 Cover Sheet for Patient -Completed 
Questionnaires. If the phone interview is to complete data on a partially completed, 
form, review all the questions with the patient, even those previously completed, 
in case the patient needs to change a previously answered question. If the phone interview is not completed as scheduled, reschedule to remain within the ± 14-day 
window for the study time point.

5. As a general reminder, review all completed questionnaires to be sure all 
of the questions have been answered and, when the patient is directed to 
mark only one response, that only one answer is marked. If the patient has marked more than one answer per question, ask which answer reflects 
how the patient is feeling. If the patient has skipped a question, tell the 
patient that a question was not answered and ask if the patient would like to answer the question. If the patient is unable to answer the question at 
the time of the visit, site staff are encouraged to retain the questionnaire and contact the patient by phone to obtain outstanding information. If patient does not want to answer a particular question, the study staff will 
enter “Not answered by the patient” in Medidata RAVE®.  
 
6. Caregivers may assist patients with their questionnaires by administering the questionnaire orally to the patient, helping the patient find information 
and/or recording the patient’s answers. Caregivers cannot answer for the patient. For patients who are too sick to complete the questionnaire (even 
with assistance from the caregiver) or who are not able to come to a clinical 
visit (e.g. enrolled in hospice care), the study staff will record on the S1820 
Cover Sheet for Patient -Completed Questionnaires that the patient was 
too sick to complete the questionnaire.  
 
7. Patients will not receive incentives (e.g. gift cards, monetary 
compensation) for participation in this study.  
 
8. S1820 Cover Sheet for Patient -Completed Questionnaires . For each time 
point, the study staff completes the S1820 Cover Sheet for Patient - 
Completed Questionnaires. The Cover Sheet is submitted with the set of 
patient completed forms at each scheduled assessment. The Cover Sheet 
is very important for tracking how and when the patient forms were 
completed. When a patie nt-completed form is not administered at a 
scheduled time point, it is important to know why the assessment did not 
occur; the form includes potential reasons for a patient not completing a 
form. All issues of noncompliance are noted on the S1820  Cover Sheet for 
Patient -Completed Questionnaires.  
 
15.2 Additional Quality Control Procedures  
 
a. Anyone involved in the collection of quality of life data in SWOG trials should review the training program available on the SWOG website under the Members Resources/CRA Workbench tab. After logging on with CTEP -IAM credentials, click 
on the Training link for access to the Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaires Training Module. The training program is a narrated set of slides designed to standardize the way quality of life data is collected from patients. Questions 
regarding the quality of life assessments  can be addressed to the SWOG Statistics 
and Data Management Center (206- 652-2267).  
 
b. Required Destruction of Source Documents: In accordance with SWOG Policy all 
source documents may be destroyed three- years post completion of the 
study.   Due to a specific contract with a PRO vendor for this study, 
destruction of the I -PANAS -SF at the three -year mark will be 
required.   Destruction of source documents related to this instrument is to include 
all patient completed source documents as well as any unused questionnaires.    All 
such materials are to be destroyed on- site in accordance with institu tional 
policy.   Sites will be notified by memo from the SWOG Operations office of the 
destruction date. Destruction of source documents other than the I -PANAS- SF is 
at the discretion of the institution.

18.2 AIMS -RC Intervention Sessions  
 
AIMS- RC is based on the Motivation and Problem- Solving (MAPS) approach. The overarching 
theoretical rationale for MAPS is the social cognitive theory of behavior change.80 The theory 
suggests  that even with adequate self -efficacy, an individual may fail without motivation for 
change.81 Similarly, Miller and colleagues82 suggests that an internal motivational shift prompts an 
individual to decide and commit to long- term behavior change. In using the MAPS approach, skills 
training (coping, problem- solving) is systematically added with motivational interviewing ( MI) and 
adjusted based on the individual’s level of motivation.  Three constructs are postulated to serve as potential mediators to behavior change. Motivation  predicts both the decision to change, and the 
likelihood of long -term change. Motivation is dynamic, characterized by frequent fluctuations, and 
can change rapidly based on context.76-79 The MAPS approach places specific emphasis on 
motivation and on appropriate therapeutic responses to common rapid fluctuations in motivat ion 
that occur throughout the change process. Agency/Self -efficacy  reflects the ability to intentionally 
affect one’s behavior.83 Self-efficacy is a form of agency that is context and behavior -dependent; it 
can successfully predict behavior change. MAPS is thought to influence agency through the removal of barriers to change, problem- solving and coping skills training, and increased 
motivation.
84-86 
 Positive/Negative Affect  are two broad mood factors that are dominant in self -reported mood.
87 
Positive affect  (PA) reflects one’s level of pleasurable experience with the environment; in contract, negative affect (NA) is a general factor of subjective distress.
87 Life stressors, such as 
those experienced by RC survivors, may suppress motivation, decrease self -efficacy, and 
adversely impact long- term behavior change.88-91 Social cognitive theory posits that ambivalence 
and a weak commitment to change can increase NA, particularly during high- risk situations (such 
as those frequently encountered by RC survivors).91 Reductions in NA are thought to increase 
motivation and agency.  
 
The AIMS -RC intervention is also based on the Chronic Care Self -Management Model (CCM).24-27 
It provides one- on-one health coaching to support diet modifications for bowel health and healthy 
survivorship diet. The coaching incorporates cognitive behavioral therapy that is operationalized 
through motivational interviewing techniques to deliver behavior -based, dietary interventions for 
symptom management. The intervention supports behavior change with structured feedback, re-
assessments, and goal setting.   
 Detailed content for each session is as follows:  
 
a. Session 1  
 
This first coaching call is targeted within 10 days after Step 2 randomization. The health 
coach will provide an introduction of the overall program, with support and coaching on use 
of the food and symptom diary. The health coach will provide an overview of the AIMS -RC 
resource manual with support reference materials and intervention content.  
 
b. Session 2  
 
This coaching call is targeted to be a week after Session 1. The health coach begins by 
introducing the structure of each telephone session. The resource manual provided in Session 1 is introduced and reviewed. Using the food and symptom diary, participants are coached to accurately document their food intake and note any symptoms associated with 
the foods. SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Timely) goals for diet 
behavior change in relation to symptom management are identified by the patient, with support from the health coaches.  
  
 S1820  
 Page 51 
 Version Date 03/03/2023  
 
 
 
c. Sessions 3- 6 
 
Phone calls once per week: During these calls, the health coach reviews  the food/symptom 
diary and SMART goals with the patient. The diary information is used to steer discussion 
on the elimination/substitution process of possible troublesome foods for bowel symptoms. 
The health coach and patient will review the food/symptom diary, as well as problem- solve 
to integrate other symptom management strategies beyond diet modifications (e.g. , sitz 
baths, fiber supplements).  
 
d. Sessions 7- 8 
 
Phone calls once every other week: Here, the health coach focuses on reintroducing, on a 
3-day schedule, patient -identified foods. The elimination/re- introduction diet process helps 
participants identify the main food “culprits” that cause bowel symptoms, but also provides the skills needed to re- introduce other foods that are tolerable and beneficial. Participants 
are coached to use problem -solving skills for overcoming diet behavior change challenges. 
Evidence- based diet recommendations for cancer survivorship are also i ntroduced.  
 
e. Sessions 9- 10 
 
Phone calls once per month. Here, the health coach reviews progress that the participants 
made and the skills they have gained to re- enforce self -efficacy for long- term application 
of the intervention. The health coach also revisits the resource manual and reviews using 
SMART goals for appropriate diet behavior change.

18.3  General Study Description – Overview  
 
See the study flow diagram in Section 7.2 .  
 
The patient will complete informed consent and baseline questionnaires during the initial study visit.  
After completion of baseline questionnaires, study site staff will provide patients with a Run-I n 
Packet. The site will register eligible  patients to Step 1 within 7 days after consent and completion 
of baseline questionnaires. The site will submit the S1820  Patient Contact Form within 24 hours of 
Step 1 registration .  (See Section 18.5  for COVID -19-related exceptions .) 
 
All run -in activities will be performed by the University of Arizona. After a patient has completed the 
run-in period, the University of Arizona will notify the site via email whether the patient suc cessfully 
completed the run- in requirements  (“pass” or “not pass”) . Within 5 days after receipt of that email, 
the site will evaluate Step 2 eligibility and either register the eligible patient to S tep 2 or submit the 
S1820 Pre-Randomization Off Study form for the ineligible patient. There is no additional patient 
consent required for Step 2 registration. (See Section 18.5  for COVID -19-related exceptions .) 
 
The SWOG SDMC will notify  the University of Arizona as to which arm the patient has been 
randomized or if they will not be randomized. For randomized patients, the University of Arizona 
will administer the appropriate telephone coaching sessions. The site will administer patient 
questionnaires and submit follow -up data at 18 and 26 weeks  after Step 2 registration. Patient 
follow -up is complete after 26 weeks .

18.4 University of Arizona -Directed Data Collection  
 
BFI Data Collection  
In addition to their experience in administering instruments via telephone, another advantage of 
having University of Arizona administer the BFI is that the assessor will be blinded to study arm. 
The consistent telephone administration, with blinding of the assessor, will reduce potential confounding bias for the BFI, which is the primary endpoint of the trial.  
 24-Hour Dietary Recall Methodology  
The 24- hour dietary recalls consist of three randomly assigned days per participant at each 
measurement time point including.  Interviewers record all food and beverage consumption over a 
24-hour period using the USDA multi -pass method with the University of Minnesota Nutrition Data 
System -Research Version (NDS -R). The University of Minnesota Nutrition Data System- Research 
Version (NDS -R) is a microcomputer -based system for collection and analysis of dietary data that 
prompts the user to describe food intake at the level of detail such as food source, processing 
method, fat and salt used in preparation, and ingredients that contribute to fat and sodium intake.  The nutrient database contains over 18,000 foods, 8,000 brand- name products, and many ethnic 
foods .  Values are available for 165 nutrients and nutrient ratios. The database is derived from 
USDA, food manufacturers, foreign food composition tables, and scientific literature.  The recall documents type of food/beverages, recipes and preparation, and estimated portion sizes. The recall procedures include reviewing data entry for duplicate foods as well as single food items that exceed specified calorie, fat or weight amounts.  
 Other Data Collection  
Data collection for certain exploratory  endpoints is performed by University of Arizona staff during 
the run- in period and in conjunction with the coaching calls. The items used to assess successful 
completion of the run- in activities are collected by the University of Arizona and sent to the study 
sites and the SDMC (see Section 7.3
). The coaching call completion rate (adherence) and dietary 
recall completion (retention) are collected by the University of Arizona and sent to the SDMC.

18.5 Allowances during COVID -19 pandemic  
 
In order to provide participating sites flexibility during the COVID -19 pandemic, some of the 
timeframes for study procedures are extended.  Use of an extended window does NOT need to be 
reported as a deviation.  However, the rationale for utilization of the extended window must be 
carefully documented in the patient chart as resulting from the COVID -19 pandemic .  
 
Step 1 Registration:  
 
• The allowable window between consent/completion of baseline QOL forms and Step 1 registration is extended to 15 days.  
• The allowable window between Step 1 registration and submission of the S1820 Patient 
Contact Form to the University of Arizona is extended to 72 hours.  
 
Step 2 Registration:  
 
• The allowable window between receipt of notification of run- in completion from the 
University of Arizona and Step 2 Registration is extended to 10 days.  
 
Note:  The window between Step 1  Registration and Step 2 Registration remains at 40 days.

18.6 Procedures for Remote Consent  
 
Remote informed consent by telephone is allowed to reduce burden. As is preferred by each 
individual institution, participants may be contacted and recruit ed in a combination of ways. These 
include in -person clinic visits or remote recruitment via telephone by the study coordinator to 
discuss the study, email and/or mailed letters, using clinically available contact information. Sites 
should follow the NCI’s CIRB Remote Consenting Procedures outlined in Section 18.6 to 
implement a remote consenting process. If a p articipant is consented remotely, study coordinators 
must wait to receive the participant’s signed consent form ( e.g., via mail, fax or email) prior to 
conducting any research activities , including questionnaire administration and step 1 registration.  
  
1. The participant  receives a copy of the informed consent document ( e.g., via mail, 
fax, or email) in advance  of discussion regarding participation in S1820. If mailed, 
two copies must be mailed so the participant  is able to retain a copy for reference 
when their signed document is returned to the site and they are waiting to receive 
the final copy with all necessary signatures back from the site.  If postal mail is used, 
a pre- paid, self -addressed envelope must also be provided to the participant  to mail 
the signed consent form back to the investigator.  
2. T he Responsible Investigator/designee discusses S1820 with the potential 
participant  either via telephone or video conferencing.  The Responsible Investigator 
must have the same consent discussion via telephone/video conferencing that 
would occur with the participant  during an in- person meeting.  
3. The Responsible Investigator/ designee must also implement a method to ensure 
the identity of the participant , by verification of state identification or other identifying 
documents or use of personal questions or visual methods.  
4. A  witness must be present during the telephone/videoconferencing consent 
process.  There are no restrictions on who can serve as a witness and the witness 
does not need to be impartial. The witness must be able to hear both sides of the 
conversation ( e.g., speaker phone, conference line). Requirements for social 
distancing due to Covid- 19 or other extenuating circumstances, may dictate that the 
witness may be in a different location than the potential participant  and/or the 
Responsible Investigator/designee obtaining consent. Any arrangement is acceptable provided that the witness can listen to both parties in the informed consent discussion.  
5. I
f the potential participant  agrees to participation, they sign the consent form and 
return it to the investigator via mail, fax, or email.  
6. Once the research team receives the signed informed consent document(s) from the participant , the Responsible Investigator who conducted the consent process 
must also sign and date the document using the current date.  
7. Under the signature line, the Responsible Investigator or designee must document 
whether consent was obtained over the telephone or video conferencing, the date 
of the telephone/video conference, and the date the signed consent was received.  
For example, “ Discussed with [participant ] via [telephone or videoconferencing] on 
[insert date] and received signed consent form on [insert date].”  Include a brief 
reason for performing the informed consent discussion over the telephone/videoconferencing.  
8. If the site has an informed consent policy that requires the witness to sign the consent document, the witness signs the informed consent. If the site does not have an informed consent policy that requires the signature of the witness on the consent 
docume nt, then the name of the witness along with the date of the original 
 S1820  
 Page 56  
 Version Date 03/03/2023  
 
 
consenting phone call is recorded in the research records to document the 
participation of the witness.  
9. The date the Responsible Investigator or designee signs the informed consent 
document , not the date the consent discussion with the participant  took place, is the 
official date of informed consent for the participant on the trial.   
10. The final informed consent document must be filed in the designated 
investigator/site regulatory file location.  A copy of the final informed consent 
document, signed by the pa rticipant , the investigator, and the witness (if applicable), 
must be sent back to the participant  via email/scan, fax, or postal mail.  
11. No research activities related to the study can begin until all steps of the informed 
consent process are complete.  
 
For sites using remote consent that allow the use of electronic signature 
(eSignature), submit the information on the Study Specific Worksheet  (SSW) or the 
Signatory Institution Worksheet (SIW) using IRBManager before collecting the 
eSignature.  See Section 13.3a.   
 
Whether consent is obtained in- person or via remote consent, the Responsible 
Investigator or designee will ma ke clear d uring the consent process that 
participation is voluntary  and will not a dversely affect the participant’s medical care .

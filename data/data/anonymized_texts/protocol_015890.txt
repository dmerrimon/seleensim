 4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.1 Background  
4.1.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decad es [1].  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies [2; 3; 4; 5; 6] .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio 
of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immu ne 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD _L2) 
[7; 8] .  The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [9].  PD -1 and family members are 
type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the  binding of 
signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are 
involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [7; 10; 11; 12] .  The mechanism by which PD -
1 down modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4 as both 
molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [13; 14] .  PD -1 was shown to be 
expressed on activated lymphocytes including pe ripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T 
regs and Natural Killer cells [15; 16] .  Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4 -CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and 
dendritic cells [17].  The ligands for PD-1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed 
or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissues as well as in 
various tumors [13; 18; 19; 20] .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing 
both IgV - and I gC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic 
regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD ligand s to PD -1 inhibits T -cell 
activation triggered through the T -cell receptor.  PD -L1 is expressed at low levels on various 
non-hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is 
only detectably expressed on antigen -presentin g cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in 
lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral 
tissues [13].  Although healthy organs  express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to 
regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL) [21].  This

 suggests that the P D-1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and 
should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly selective humanized 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. 
4.1.2 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
4.2 Rationale  
4.2.1 Rationale for the Trial a nd Selected Subject Population  
Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States [22].  The predominant 
histological type is transitional cell carcinoma accounting for > 90% of bladder tumors in 
Europe and USA.   Seventy percent of bladder tumors are superficial at presentation and 
include carcinoma in situ (cis), Ta, and T1 disease.  CIS of the bladder is a less common 
high-grade diffuse surface -spreading lesion confined to the u rothelium accounting for 1% to 
4% of the primary tumors and occurs concomitantly with a papillary tumor in 13% to 20% of 
bladder cancer patients.  The remainder of superficial bladder cancers extend above the 
surface of the epithelium in papillary lesions (Ta), or invade into the submucosal layer (T1) 
without invading into the muscularis propria of the bladder wall.  Despite conservative 
management by endoscopic resection, 60% to 70% of superficial tumors recur, and 20% to 
30% of recurrent tumors will progr ess to a higher stage or grade [23].  For superficial urinary 
bladder cancer, one of the established primary treatment modalities involves the direct 
infusion of Bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG) into the bladder, and this procedure is 
recommended to those with intermediate or high risk of recurrence or stage progression.  
BCG installation  has been used to treat non -muscle -invasive bladder cancer for more than 30 
years.  It is one of the most successful biotherapies for cancer in use.  Despite long clinical 
experience with BCG , the mechanism of its therapeutic effect is still under investigation.   
Available evidence suggests that urothelial cells (including bladder cancer cells themselves) 
and cells of the immune system both have crucial roles in the therapeutic antitumor effec t of 
BCG. The possible involvement of bladder cancer cells includes attachment and 
internalization of BCG, secretion of cytokines and chemokines, and presentation of BCG 
and/or cancer cell antigens to cells of the immune system.  Immune system cell subsets  that 
have potential roles in BCG therapy include CD4  (+) and CD8  (+) lymphocytes, natural 
killer cells, granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.  Bladder cancer cells are killed 
through direct cytotoxicity by these cells, by secretion of solu ble fa ctors such as TRAIL 
(tumo r necrosis factor -related apoptosis -inducing ligand), and, to some degree, by the direct 
action of BCG [24].  For bladder CIS, BCG is considered as the primary standard  [25] and 
the only treatment option available that has been shown to be effective aside from removing 
the bladder  [26].  BCG has also been shown to decrease the rate of progression  of superficial 
bladder cancer into more invasive forms of the disease  [27-31]; however, only t wo thirds of

Page 11 of 89 
 patients respond to BCG, and one third of the responders will develop recurrent disease, 
which is associated with a poor prognosis  [32; 33].  Given that the only other accepted 
standard treatment for high risk superficial urothelial cancer is radical cystectomy, 
identification of active agents in this disease is clearly warranted.  
The blockade of immune checkpoints of the pathway involving progr ammed death 1 ( PD-1) 
and its ligands, CD274 (PD -L1) and CD273 (PD -L2), has been shown recently to be 
effective in cancer therapy.  As more clinical trial s evaluating immune checkpoint -targeted 
drugs are published, the potential of these agents in managing treatment resistant cancers is 
becoming more obvious  [34; 35].  PD-1 is an inhibitory cell -surface receptor that can be 
stimulated to be expressed by T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) T cells, monocytes, and 
dendriti c cells (DC ) [29].  PDL2 is expressed mainly by DCs and macrophages, whereas 
PDL -1 is widely expressed by hematopoietic, non -hematopoietic, and tumor cells [36; 37 ].  
Higher expression of PDL -1 in ca ncer is associated with decreasing survival since tumors 
can evade the immune system by the inhibitory action of PD-1 [38-40].  Clinical trials with 
murine antibodies targeting PD-1 and PDL -1 have shown very promising results in advanced 
cancers.  In a study by Brahmer et al., a total of 207 patients - 75 with non -small -cell lung 
cancer, 55 with melanoma, 18 with colorectal cancer, 17 with renal -cell cancer, 17 with 
ovarian cancer, 14 with pancreatic cancer, 7 with gastric cancer, and 4 with breast cancer  - 
were all given anti -PD-L1 antibody.  The median duration of ther apy was 12 weeks (range, 2 
to 111).  Among patients with a response that could be evaluated, an objective response (a 
complete or partial response) was observed in 9 of 52 patients with melanoma, 2 of 17 with 
renal -cell cancer, 5 of 49 with non -small -cell lung cancer, and 1 of 17 with ovarian cancer.   
Responses lasted for 1 year or more in 8 of 16 patients with at least 1 year of follow -up [34].  
In a recent study presented in an abstract form at the 2014 annual meeting of the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology, humanized monoclonal IgG4 anti -PD-1 antibody MK -3475 
was administered to a non -randomized cohort of 411 ipilimumab -naive (IPI -N) and IPI -
treated (IPI -T) melanoma patients.  The authors  observed that among the 365 patients  with 
measurable disease at baselin e, over all response rate by RECIST was 40% (95% CI 32% -
48%) in IPI -N and 2 8% (95% CI 22% -35%) in IPI -T patients , and that the responses were 
durable .  Median progression free survival by RECIST was 24 weeks in IPI -N and 23 weeks 
in IPI -T patients  and medi an overall survival (OS) was not reached, with 1 -year overall 
survival of 71% in all patients .  The authors then concluded that MK -3475 showed durable 
responses and a manageable safety profile across dose and schedules in IPI -N and IPI -T 
melanoma patients (http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/133842 -144).  
PD-L1 expression, a marker for response to anti -PD-1 agents, was observed in 7% of pTa, 
16% of pT1, and 45% of carcinoma in situ (CIS) tumors. PD -L1 expression in these tumors 
was also associated with hi gh-grade disease and tumor infiltration by mononuclear cells.  In 
addition, PD -L1 expression was found to be extremely abundant in the BCG -induced bladder 
granulomata in patients failing BCG treatment [41].  Recent pharmacokinetic studies  
showing efficacy of anti -PD-1 agents in  advanced melanoma and other cancers supports 
combining these agents with  BCG treatment in patients with high risk superficial bladder 
cancer  to provide these patients with an alternative to radical cystectomy if they fail BCG 
alone.  Previous experience with immunologic response supports dosing patients with anti -

Page 12 of 89 
 PD-1 agents 2-3 weeks  before BCG treatment, which would allow the bladder to  be primed 
for BCG with the hopes of a greater number of com plete responses to BCG [42].  This 
combination, if successful, could help patients avoid cystectomy; a complicated surgery with 
very high complication and readmission rates, and one that permanent ly alters a patient’s 
quality of life [43]. 
4.2.2 Rationale for Dos e Selection/Regimen/Modification  
The dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W (every 3 weeks) of pembrolizumab is planned for all 
urothelial cancer trials.  Available PK results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other 
solid tumor types support a lack of meaningful d ifference in PK exposures obtained at a 
given dose among tumor types.  An open -label Phase 1 trial (PN001) in melanoma subjects 
was conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab.   
The dose escalation  portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 
mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.    All 
three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.    This 
first in human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement and objective 
evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
Q2W).    No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified.  
In KEYNOTE -001, two rand omized cohort evaluations of melanoma subjects receiving 
pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been completed.    The 
clinical efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of clinically important differences in 
efficacy response or safe ty profile at these doses.    For example, in Cohort B2, advanced 
melanoma subjects who had received prior ipilimumab therapy were randomized to receive 
pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W.    The overall response rate (ORR) was 
26% (21/81) in the 2 mg/kg group and 26% (25/79) in the 10 mg/kg group (full analysis set 
(FAS)).    The proportion of subjects with drug -related adverse events (AEs), grade 3 -5 drug -
related AEs, serious drug -related AEs, death or discontinuation due to an AE was 
comparable bet ween groups or lower in the 10 mg/kg group.  
Available pharmacokinetic results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other solid tumor 
types support a lack of meaningful difference in pharmacokinetic exposures obtained at a 
given dose among tumor types.    Population PK analysis has been performed and has 
confirmed the expectation that intrinsic factors do not affect exposure to pembrolizumab to a 
clinically meaningful extent.    Taken together, these data support the use of lower doses (with 
similar exposure to 2 mg/kg Q3W) in all solid tumor indications.   The dose of   2 mg/kg 
Q3W is being evaluated in NSCLC in PN001, Cohort F30 and PN010, and 200 mg Q3W is 
being evaluated in head and neck cancer in PN012, which are expected to provide additional 
data support ing the dose selection.  
Selection of 200 mg as the appropriate dose for a switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulation results indicating that 200 mg will provide exposures that are reasonably 
consistent with those obtained with 2 mg/kg dose and important ly will maintain individual 
patient exposures within the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with 
maximal clinical response.    A population PK model, which characterized the influence of 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 13 of 89 
 body weight and other patient covariates on exposure , has been developed using available 
data from 476 subjects from PN001.    The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed 
dose are predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose, with some 
tendency for individual values to range  slightly higher with the 200 mg fixed dose.   The 
slight increase in PK variability predicted for the fixed dose relative to weight -based dosing 
is not expected to be clinically important given that the range of individual exposures is well 
contained withi n the range of exposures shown in the melanoma studies of 2 and 10 mg/kg to 
provide similar efficacy and safety.    The population PK evaluation revealed that there was 
no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure.  In addition, exposure was similar 
between the NSCLC and melanoma indications.  Therefore, there are no anticipated changes 
in exposure between different tumor types and indication settings.  
To ensure the  safety and efficacy, the first 3 subjects will be dosed at 100 mg rather than 200 
mg eve ry 3 weeks.  If the first 3 patients do not have any significant safety or efficacy issues 
the dose will be escalated to 200 mg every 3 weeks.  
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints  
4.2.3.1  Complete Response  Endpoint  
The study will determine the complete response  rate at 19 weeks , 3 months post treatment 
visit, 12 months post treatment visit, and 24 months post treatment visit based on multiple 
previous studies that used approximate follow up  to predict  long-term disease survival in 
patients with superficial bladder cancer .  Previous research showed up to a 50% recurrence 
rate at 3 months of follow -up in high risk superficial bladder cancer patients , which w as 
similar to the cohort of patients included in this study .  In a study by Skinn er et al., a total of 
58 patients were e nrolled in  a study for gemcitabine  in superficial bladder cancer, and 47 
were evaluable for response.  Median patient age was 70 years (range 50 to 88).  Of the 
evaluable patients 42 (89%) had high risk disease, including high grade Ta in 12 (26%), high 
grade T1 in 2 (4%) and carcinoma in situ in 28 (60%) with or without papillary lesions.  At 
the initial 3 -month evaluation  only 47% of patients were free of disease  [44].  Sylvetser et al. 
analyzed data on 2596 patients with non muscle invasive bladder cancer, and derived  a 
simple s coring system based on six clinical and pathological factors: number of tumors, 
tumor size, prior recurrence  rate, T category, carcinoma in situ, and grade to predict 
recurrence.  The probabilities of recurrence  at one year  were up to 61% .  At five years, the 
probability of recurrence was up to  78 % [45]. 
4.2.3.2  Biomarker Research  
To better determine patients who would bene fit from the combinations of BCG and MK-
3475 , if proven effective and possibly better select patients for phase II, biomarker research 
will be performed to investigate immunologic and genetic biomarkers for treatment response.   
Pre- and post -treatment blad der biopsy specimens will be examined for PD-1, PDL -1, and 
CD3  as immunologic markers for response to MK-3475 .  Whole exome sequencing of

5.2 Trial Treatments  
The treatment s to be used in this trial are outlined below in Table 2. 
Table 2: Trial Treatment  
Drug  Dose/Potency  Dose 
Frequency  Route of 
Administration  Regimen/Treatment 
Period  Use 
MK-3475a, b 100 mg  Every 21 days  IV infusion  6 cycles  Experimental  
MK-3475b 200 mg  Every 21 days  IV infusion  6 cycles  Experimental  
BCG  1 vial  Every 7 days  Bladder 
Instillation  6 cycles  Approved  
a The first 3 subjects will be dosed at 100 mg.  If the Data Safety Review Team approves, the dose will be 
escalated to 200 mg with the fourth subject enrolled.  
b The MK -3475 dosing interval may be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 5.2. 3.3.  BCG 
treatment may be interrupted or delayed as  per the instructions for use supplied with BCG  (Section 5.2.1.1.3) . 
BCG: One vial of BCG suspended in 50 ml preservative -free saline.  BCG is to be given through a urinary 
catheter (intravesically) into the bladder.  BCG treatment will occur once per week for 6 weeks.  BCG 
treatment will commence on the 3rd cycle of treatment with MK -3475, Week 7.  BCG is a FDA approved 
treatment and will  be supplied commercially through the study site pharmacy.  
5.2.1 BCG Treatment  
5.2.1.1  BCG treatment will be according to Insti tutional standard for the site ; 
however, the BCG will be provided by MERCK due to the BCG shortage to ensure 
completion of the study.  
For pati ents with multi -focal disease, it is highly recommended that the patient have a 
urologic stent and catheter placed prior to the first pembrolizumab treatment to allow 
for stabilization of the mucosa prior to the start of treatment with BCG.  Placement will  
be at the discretion of the treating physician.  
5.2.1.1.1  Dose Selection  
The rationale for the use of the indicated dose of BCG is based upon FDA approved and 
commercially provided package insert/instructions for use of the product.  Dosing for the 
intravesical tre atment of carcinoma in situ and for the prophylaxis of recurrent papillary 
tumors consists of one vial of BCG suspended in 50 ml preservative -free saline.  The 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 19 of 89 
 preparation of the BCG suspension will be completed using aseptic technique and according 
to FDA  approved labeling and use information.   Patients with multi -focal disease may have 
treatment with more than one vial to ensure treatment of all tumor sites (generally kidney or 
ureter in addition to bladder).  Essentially to allow for proper treatment, it  is anticipated that 
one vial will be used to treat each organ/distinct urologic structure.  
5.2.1.1.2  Preparation  
Consult  FDA approved package insert for instructions on BCG preparation  (Appendix C  has 
the insert for TICE® BCG, there are other manufacturers of BCG t hat may also be utilized .) 
5.2.1.1.3  Dose Delay  
BCG treatment  will be w ithheld for Grade >2 hematuria, Grade  >1 fever and drug-related 
Grade 4 hematologic toxicities, and all other non-hematological toxicity  Grade  ≥3 adverse 
effects, including laboratory abnormalities, and  severe or life -threatening AEs.  Treatment 
should be postponed until resolution of febrile illness, urinary tract infection, or gross 
hematuria and adverse effect resolution to Grade < 1.  The treating Investigator  who is a  
qualified  physician may delay treatment for Grade 1 and 2 adverse effects if the treating 
Investigator  believes it is in the best interest of the patient.  In the event of a grade 1 or 2  
immune related adverse event requiring corticosteroid treatment, BCG treatment may  be 
delayed for up to 2 weeks with the expectation that steroid treatment will be discontinued 
prior to the  next BCG treatment cycle.   A delay of longer than 2 weeks will permanently 
discontinue the patient from BCG treatment within the study or permanent withdrawal of the 
patient from the study.  The choice will be at the discretion of the treating Investigat or.  
Steroid treatment for grade 3 or higher immune mediated events will require discontinuation 
of BCG treatment and/or withdrawal from the study.  
Instillation of BCG with an actively bleeding mucosa may promote systemic BCG infection.   
Therefore, treatment will be postponed for at least two weeks following transurethral 
resection, biopsy, traumatic catheterization, or gross hematuria.  
Patients will be  asked to report any fever or  flu-like symptoms to their treating Investigator  
immediately , as well as any systemic manifestations increasing in intensity with repeated 
instillations, or local symptoms (frequency, urgency, burning sensation with urination)  
lasting more than 2 -3 days.  If a patient develops persistent fever or experiences an acute 
febrile illness consistent with BCG infection, BCG treatment will be discontinued and the 
patient immediately evaluated and treated for systemic infection.  Intravesical instillations of 
BCG will also be postponed during treatment with antibiotics, since antimicrobial therapy 
may interfere with the effectiveness of BCG.  
5.2.1.1.4  Monitoring for Systemic Dissemination of BCG  
To ensure early identification of systemic BCG  infection, subjects will be monitored for 
symptoms of systemic infection.  For each cycle of BCG treatment, subjects will be 
telephoned on Days 2 -4 (Treatment is Day 1) of Treatment Weeks 7 -12 to inquire about any 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 20 of 89 
 symptoms they may be experiencing.  In ad dition to this, each patient will be provided with a  
thermometer and diary and asked to record oral temperatures each morning and evening 
throughout the BCG treatment (Weeks 7 -12) and for recording of any other symptoms they 
may be experiencing.  
5.2.1.2  Timing of  Dose Administration  
BCG  treatment should be administered  beginning on D ay 1 of Cycle 3 (Week 7) of MK -3475 
after all procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart 
(Section 7.0).  BCG treatment will be repeated every 7 days  at weeks 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 . 
BCG  treatment may be administered up to 1 day before or after the scheduled date (at 7 days) 
due to administrative reasons . 
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis  and according to i nstitutional 
standards  
5.2.1.3  Drug/Treatment  
BCG is given through a urinary catheter (intravesically) into the bladder .  BCG will be 
instilled into the bladder according to institutional standards based on FDA approved 
indications for treatment of bladder cancer.  Additional lesions in patients with multi -focal 
disease will be treated per intuitional standard s and directed by the treating urologist.  The 
treatment will be given once a week for 6 weeks.

Subjects may develop symptoms of bladder irritability related to the inflammatory response 
induced by BCG, as well as hematuria following BCG intravesicular treatment.  The 
symptoms typically begin 4 -6 hours after instillation and last 24-72 hours.  The irritative side 
effects are usually seen following the third instillation, and tend to increase in severity after 
each administration.  The irritative bladder adverse effects can usually be managed 
symptomatically with products such as py ridium, propantheline bromide, oxybutynin 
chloride and acetaminophen.   Symptom management will be at the discretion of the treating 
Investigator .  If the patient develops hematuria , then treatment must be postponed until urine 
is clear again.  See dose mod ification/delay  (section 5.2. 1.5) for further instruction.  No dose 
reduction or antibiotic treatment has been proven to prevent or decrease bladder irritation 
related to BCG . 
Subjects may develop “Flu -like” symptoms (malaise, fever, and chills) which ofte n reflect 
hypersensitivity reactions, and can be treated symptomatically with antihistamines  
(Prophylactic treatment with antihistamine before subsequent BCG courses is left to the 
discretion of the provider .). 
The most serious complication of BCG is disseminated BCG sepsis with associated 
mortality.  In addition, infections have been reported in lung, liver, bone, bone marrow, 
kidney, regional lymph nodes, and prostate in patients who have received intravesical BCG.  
Some male genitourinary tract infections (orchitis/epididymitis) have been resistant to 
multiple drug anti -tuberculous therapy and required orchiectomy.  These complications were 
reported in less than 1% of patients.  
5.2.1.5  Dose Modification for BCG  
BCG dos e modification has not been shown to reduce toxicity ; therefore, no dose 
modifications will be attempted in this trial.  
5.2.1.6  Over Dosage  
Over dosage occurs if more than one vial (per treated organ/ urologic structure) of BCG is 
administered per instillation.  If over dosage occurs, the patient should be closely monitored 
for signs of active local or systemic BCG infection.  For acute local or systemic reactions

 suggesting active infection, an infectious disease specialist experienced in BCG 
complications should b e consulted.

5.2.3 Dose Selection/Modification  
5.2.3.1  Dose Selection  
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.0 - 
Background and Rationale.  
A fixed dose of 1 00 mg MK -3475 will be given on Day 1 +/ ‒3 days of a 21 day cycle for up 
to 6 cycles for the first 3 subjects.  If one subject of the three require s the dose of MK -3475 
to be withheld or discontinued, the 100 mg cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects.  If two out 
of three or two out of six subject s develops toxicity that requires the dose to be withheld or 
discontinued, the dose will not be escalated to 200 mg MK -3475 every 3 weeks.  All 
remaining subjects will be treated at 100 mg MK -3475 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.  
The Data Safety Review Team wil l make a determination if dose escalation to 200 mg is 
possible .  The Data Safety Review Team automatically meets after 3 subjects have been 
enrolled and treated ; however, a meeting may be called sooner , if deemed necessary.  
5.2.3.2  Formulation/ Preparation  
MK-3475 is provided as a  liquid solution (100 mg/vial) in Type I glass vials intended for 
single use only.  The drug  product is stored as a stable liquid solution under refrigerated  
conditions (2°C -8°C).  The liquid product is intended for IV administration.  The liquid drug 
product can be  further diluted with normal saline in IV containers made of polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) or  non-PVC material.  The infusion solution should be immediately administered.  If 
not used immediately, vials and/or IV bags may be stored at 2 -8°C for up to a cumulative 
time of 20 hours.  If refrigerated, the vials and/or IV bags should be allowed to equilibrate to 
room temperature prior to subsequent use.  MK-3475 solutions may be  stored at room 
temperature for a cumulative time of up to 6 hours.  This includes room temperature storage 
of reconstituted drug product solution and liquid drug product in vials, room temperature 
storage of infusion solution in the IV bag and the duratio n of infusion.  
Please see the Investigators Brochure for additional drug formulation information.  
5.2.3.3  Dose Modification  (Escalation/Titration/Other)  
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab  exposure may 
represent an immunolog ic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first 
dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.  Pembrolizumab must  be withheld  for 
drug-related  toxicities  and severe or life -threatening AEs as per Table 3 below.  See Section 
5.4.1 for supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 24 of 89 
 scheduled interruption, unless otherwise di scussed with the Sponsor.  The reason for 
interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  
5.2.4 Schedule Modification for Combination Therapy  
The dosing schedule of the combination therapy will not be altered except on an individual 
drug basis ( such as holding either individual BCG or MK -3475 therapy) if the time period is 
for 2 weeks or less.  That is to say h olding either  of the two medications included in the 
combination therapy for less than two weeks should not affect the dosage schedule for the 
other medication.  Patients will be discontinued from the trial if one of the two medications is 
held for more than 2 weeks be cause of toxicity.  BCG treatment may continue, after a 2 week 
hold, outside of the study at the discretion of the treating Investigator . 
5.2.5 Timing of Dose Administration  
Trial MK-3475 treatment  (100 or 200 mg fixed dose)  should be administered on Day 1 of 
each cycle after all procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial 
Flow Chart (Section 7.0).  MK-3475  treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or 
after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons .  Subjects may be 
dosed no less than 18 days from the previous dose.  If treatment is held for greater than 3 
cycles (or 63 days) subject will be withdrawn from investigational product treatment 
permanently.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis  unless the patient is currently 
admitted to the hospital for another purpose which does not exclude treatment with BCG or 
MK-3475 or enrollment into the study.  
MK-3475 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion (treatment cycle intervals may be 
increased due to toxicity as described in Section 5.2. 3.3).  Sites should make every effort to 
target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the 
variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of −5 minutes and +10 minutes is 
permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: −5 min/+10 min).  
The Procedure Manual contains specific instructions for MK -3475 dose calculation, 
reconstitution, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration.  
5.2.6 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open -label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, Investigator  and subject will know the 
treatment administered.  
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria ar e not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The Investigator  should discuss any questions regarding this 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 25 of 89 
 with the Sponsor .  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
Investigator  and/or the subject's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the 
subject on trial therapy o r vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor, and the subject.  
5.3.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the Investigator  considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretio n of the Investigator  in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care.  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) , 
including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids .  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug , dosage, 
frequency, route, and date should  also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment 
and 30 days after the la st dose of trial treatment should be recorded.  Concomitant 
medications administered after 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be 
recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 9.0. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohib ited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and 
Treatment Phase (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:  
 Anti-cancer  systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this proto col 
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Investigational agents other than MK -3475  
 Radiation therapy  
 Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.    Examples of live vaccines include, b ut are not limited to, the 
following:   measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG (with the 
exclusion of BCG for treatment ), and typhoi d (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines 
for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and  are allowed; however , intranasal 
influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu -Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
 Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology .  The use of steroids for treatment of 
a grade 1 or 2  immune mediated adverse event may delay B CG treatment for up to 2 
weeks with the expectation that steroid treatment will be discontinued prior to the next 
BCG treatment cycle.  A delay of longer than 2 we eks will permanently discontinue the 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 26 of 89 
 patient from BCG treatment within the study or permanent withdrawal of the patient from 
the study.  The choice will be at the discretion of the treating Investigator .  Steroid 
treatment for grade 3 or higher immune medi ated events will require discontinuation of 
BCG treatment and/or withdrawal from the study.  
 The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with 
the Sponsor.  
 Drug combinations containing immunosuppressants and/or bone mar row depressants 
and/or radiation.  The above mentioned therapies interfere with the development of the 
immune response and should not be used in combination with BCG . 
 Antimicrobial therapy may interfere with the effectiveness of BCG treatment.  If 
antimicr obial therapy is required, BCG treatment should be delayed as appropriate.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by the Investigator, require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial  
treatment or delayed in the case of antimicrobial treatment .  Subjects may receive other 
medications that the Investigator  deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited ther apies during the Post -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.4 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.4.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator.  Suggested supportive care measu res for the management of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below.  Where appropriate, t hese 
guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as 
additional anti -inflammatory agents if sy mptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms 
may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, attempts should be made 
to rule out other causes su ch as metastatic disease  or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care.   The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when 
the Investigator  determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note:  If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
Investigator  does not need to follow the treatment guidance  (as outlined 
below) .  Refer to Section 5.2.1 for dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such  as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.

Page 27 of 89 
  Pneumonitis : 
 For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids.  When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
 Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections  in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration . 
 Diarrhea/Colitis : 
Subject s should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
 All subject s who experience diarrhea /colitis  should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid 
and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.   For Grade 2 or higher 
diarrhea, consider GI consu ltation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out 
colitis.  
 For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis , administer oral corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis , treat with intravenous steroids followed by 
high dose oral steroids . 
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or  less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset , including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] ) or 
≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia , if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic 
acidosis (DKA)  
 For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes 
mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic 
acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine 
ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 Hypophysitis : 
 For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids .  When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate ho rmones may be required as the 
steroid dose is tapered.  
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 28 of 89 
  For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed 
by oral corticosteroids.  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid 
taper should be started and continued over no  less than 4 weeks.  Replacement 
of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism : 
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment.  Monitor patients for 
changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, 
and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of 
thyroid disorders.  
 Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective bet a-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
 Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corti costeroid followed by oral 
corticosteroids.  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid 
taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid 
dose is tapered.  
 Hepatic : 
 For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until 
returned to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 
hours.  
 When symptoms impro ve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
 For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
 When symptoms improve t o Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.

  Management of Infusion Reactions : 
Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and 
generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Table 4 below  shows treatment guidelines for subject s who experience an infusion 
reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ). 
 Supportive Care for Suspected Primary Adrenal Insufficiency  
If symptoms are suggest ive of an endocrinopathy and the patient is not in adrenal 
crisis, endocrine laboratory results should be evaluated before corticosteroid therapy 
is initiated.  Endocrine work -up will include TSH and free T4 levels to determine if 
thyroid abnormalities are  present.  TSH, prolactin, ACTH, and a morning cortisol 
level will help to differentiate primary adrenal insufficiency from primary pituitary 
insufficiency.  Grade 1 or 2 endocrine toxicity without adrenal crisis may resolve 
spontaneously if a patient has no or minimal symptoms, but patients will be 
monitored closely, with guidance from an endocrinologist; otherwise, short -term, 
high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4 mg every six hours or equivalent) 
with relevant hormone replacement (e.g., levoth yroxine, hydrocortisone, sex 
hormones) will be  administered .  Patients  in adrenal crisis (characterized by a 
constellation of symptoms suggestive of severe dehydratio n, hypotension, or shock) 
will be treated as a medical emergency and given intravenous inj ections of 
glucocorticoids and large volumes of intravenous saline solution with dextrose.

 5.5 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
5.5.1 Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
5.5.2 Contraception  
MK-3475 may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if MK -
3475 has  transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  
For this trial, male subjects will be considered to be of non -reproductive potential if they 
have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical 
condition).  
Female subjects will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they are either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses w ithout an alternative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement the rapy.  In the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR 
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or 
bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening;  
OR 
(3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant 
or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for 120 days after the 
last dose of study drug by complying with one of the following:  
(1) practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity;  
OR 
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.  
Acceptable  methods of contraception  are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
• intrauterine device  (IUD)  
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 32 of 89 
 • vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):  
• diaphragm with spermici de (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)  
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill ( estrogen /progestin pill or progestin -
only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or  subcutaneous  
contraceptive injection  
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contracepti on if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation 
methods, etc.) and wit hdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, 
then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects 
participating at sites in this countr y/region.  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate 
in the study , subjects of childbearing potential  must adhere t o the contraception requirement 
(described above) from  the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the 
initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout  the study  period up to 120 
days after the last dose of trial therapy.   If there is any question that a subject  of childbearing 
potential  will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should 
not be entered into the study.  
5.5.3 Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on tre atment with MK -3475, the subject 
will immediately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the subject at least 
monthly and document the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be r eported to the Sponsor and to 
manufacturer’s safety division  without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious 
adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -
threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  The study Investigator  will make every 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 33 of 89 
 effort to ob tain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition 
of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.  If a male subject impregnates his female partner , the 
study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy report ed to the 
Sponsor and to manufacturer’s safety division  and followed as described above and in 
Section 9.1.2. 
5.5.4 Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether MK -3475 is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are excreted 
in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing 
infant, subjects who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
5.6 Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the tria l at the 
discretion of the Investigator  should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by the Investigator  or the Sponsor if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, the 
trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or ot her safety reasons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 8.1.5.1. 
5.7 Subject Replacement Strategy  
Subjects who have been screened and enrolled will be included in an intent -to-treat 
population.  However, if a subje ct has been enrolled and subsequently treated or attempted 
treatment (IV insertion with MK -3475 preparation) with at least 1 cycle of MK -3475, the 
patient will not be replaced.   If a screened subject withdraws prior to first treatment cycle, 
that subject m ay be replaced.  
5.8 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:  
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements  
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects  
Stopping Rules:  
The number of pat ients (15 ) planned for this study is not sufficient to represent the 
population as a whole  nor is it sufficient to complete a powerful statistical analysis.  
The first 3 subjects will be treated at 100 mg every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.  If one subject 
of the three subjects require s the dose of MK -3475 be withheld or discontinued, the 100 
mg cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects.  If two out of three or two out of six subjects 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 34 of 89 
 develop toxicity that requires the dose to be withheld or discontinued, the dose will be not 
be escalated to 200 mg MK -3475 every 3 weeks.   All remaining subjects will be treat ed 
at 100 mg MK -3475 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.  
For study subject safety, i f there is any fatal toxicity or morbidity event related to the 
study treatment or procedures, or if one or more of the 15  subjects treated experience a 
grade 4 toxicity, then subject accrual will be suspended and all data pertaining to the 
events will be reviewed by the Study Investigators and Data Safety Review Team to 
determine if there is the need for any corrective actions.  
Once that review is completed and any appropriate acti on is taken, subject accrual will 
begin again , if the Data Safety Review T eam members have approved continuation of the 
study .  If there is a second fatal treatment /morbidity event related to the study treatment 
or procedures , the study will be terminated.   If 4 of 15 subjects experience grade 4 
toxicities, the accrual will be suspended and reviewed for added appropriate measures.  If 
5 subjects experience grade 4 toxicity , the study will be terminated.  
Non-local safety reports will be evaluated as they are  received.  Tabulations of the reports 
will be provided to the Data Safety Review Team with access to the full reports for 
completeness of review.  
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug  
In the event the investigational prod uct is no longer available , ample notification will be 
provided so  appropriate adjustments to subject treatment can be made.  
6.0 DATA SAFETY REVIEW TEAM  
6.1 Data/Efficacy Review  
A Data Safety Review Team will be formed to evaluate the safety of the combination of the 
treatments as well as to objectively comment on an y apparent decreased efficacy.  The first 
three subjects will be treated at 100 mg rather than the full 200 mg every 3 weeks.  Once the 
first three subjects have completed therapy and no adverse events have called for an earlier 
meeting , the Data Safety Review Team will meet to discuss the escalation of the dose to 200 
mg.  If one subject of the three subjects require s the dose of MK -3475 be withheld or 
discontinued, the 100 mg cohort will be expanded to 6 subj ects.  If two out of three or two 
out of six subjects develop toxicity that requires the dose to be withheld or discontinued, the 
dose will not be escalated to 200 mg MK -3475 every 3 weeks.  All remaining subjects will 
be treated at 100 mg MK -3475 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.  
The Data Safety Review Team  will again evaluate the patient safety and efficacy response 
after 7 and 10 subjec ts have completed the treatment regimen.  The committee will also be 
charged with enforcing the stopping rules.  All adverse event data, as well as patient response 
to treatment , will be presented to the committee and the committee will be allowed to

 8.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
8.1 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 7.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in  detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the 
investigator.  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the Sponsor for 
reasons related to subject  safety.  In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially 
sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that 
additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/ testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
8.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
8.1.1.1  Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial . 
The principles  of informed  consent  are described  by Federal  Regulatory  Guidelines  (Code of 
Federal Regulations, Title 21, Volume 1, Part  50, Revised April 1, 2013 ) and the Office  for 
Human  Research  Protections  (Code  of Federal  Regulations  45 CFR  46).  They  must  be 
followed  to comply  with federal  regulations  for the conduct  and monitoring  of clinical  
investigations.  
8.1.1.1.1  General  Informed Consent  
Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated signature or by the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative’s dated signature on a consent form along with the dated signature 
of the person conducting the consent discussion.  The case history for each  subject shall 
document that  informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study and before 
any study related procedure(s) was performed.   Original  signed  consent  forms  must  be filed 
in the site study  binder  or in each subject’s  study  file. 
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before 
participation in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form 
and any written information provided to the subject must re ceive the IRB/ERC’s 
approval/favorable opinion in advance of use.  The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to cont inue participation in the trial.  The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent 
Product:   MK-3475  
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 42 of 89 
 form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature or 
by the subject’s legally acceptable r epresentative’s dated signature.  
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at 
the protocol level.  
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations 
and Sponsor requir ements.  
8.1.1.2  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the Investigator  or qualified designee 
to ensure that the s ubject qualifies for the trial.  
8.1.1.3  Subject Identification Card  
All subjects will be given a Subject Identi fication Card identifying them as participants in a 
research trial.  The card will contain trial site contact information (including direct telephone 
numbers) to be utilized in the event of an emergency.  The Investigator  or qualified designee 
will provide  the subject with a Subject Identification Card after the subject provides written 
informed consent.  
8.1.1.4  Medical History /Demographics  
A medical history will be obtained by the Investigator  or qualified designee  who is 
participating in the study (qualified  phys ician  or nurse  practitioner  listed  as associated study 
personnel ).  Medical history will include demographics, height, and weight, and all active 
conditions, and any condition diagnosed within the prior 10 years that is considered to be 
clinically signific ant by the Investigator.  History will also include the past and current use of 
alcohol,  tobacco,  and other  illicit  drugs and performance status as assessed by the ECOG scale 
(Appendix A ).  Details regarding the disease for which the subject has enrolled in this study 
will be recorded separately and not listed as medical history.  Appropriate  data will be 
captured  in the CRF  while  all other  data will be recorded  in the source  documents.  
8.1.1.5  Prior  and Concomitant Medications Review  
8.1.1.5.1  Prior Medications  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including any 
protocol -specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the subject 
within 28 days before star ting the trial.  Prior medications will include prescription, over the 
counter, and herbal/alternative therapies.  Treatment for the disease for which the subject has 
enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and not listed as a prior medication.

Page 43 of 89 
 8.1.1.5.2  Concomitant Medications  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will record medication s, if any, taken by the subject 
during the trial.  All medications related to reportable SAEs and ECIs should be recorded as 
defined in Section 9.  Concomitant medications  must be reviewed with the prohibited 
medications list to ensure patient safety.  
8.1.1.5.3  Questionnaires  
The American Urologic Association Symptoms Index and the Quality of Life Questionnaires  
(Appendix  D) will  be administered as outlined in Section 7.  Subjects wi ll be provided time 
and space to complete the questionnaires.  A study coordinator will be on hand for any 
questions the subject may have.  All answers will remain confidential and subjects will be 
instructed to answer all question s as honestly and complet ely as possible.  
8.1.1.6  Disease Details and Treatments  
8.1.1.6.1  Disease Details  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will obtain prior and current details regarding disease 
status.  Disease details include , but are not necessarily limited to , symptoms associated with 
the disease, pathological and laboratory reports, imaging reports, treatments and response to 
treatments.  
8.1.1.6.2  Prior Treatment Details  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will review all prior cancer treatments including 
systemic tr eatments, radiation and surgeries.  
8.1.1.6.3  Subsequent Anti -Cancer Therapy Status  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will review all new anti -neoplastic therapy /treatment  
initiated after the last dose of trial treatment.  If a subject initiates a new anti -cance r 
therapy /treatment  within 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment, the 30 day Safety 
Follow -up Visit must occur before the first dose of the new therapy.  Once new anti -cancer 
therapy has been initiated , the subject will move into survival follow -up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 
24 months post treatment visits . 
8.1.1.7  Assignment of Screening Number  
Eligible subjects will be approached by consenting providers or research nurse to participate 
in this study.  Subjects who do not meet the pathological criteria for e nrollment will be 
considered a screen fail.  Those subjects who meet pathological inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be fully screened for other tests and procedures.  Subjects  will be assigned  a 5-6 character 
ID code with the first three  or four  being the site code (a  letter site code assigned to the site by the 
Sponsor) followed by a two digit number  for a subject  identifier  beginning  with 01 and each 
newly enrolled subject the subsequent number for that site .  For example, SCI -03 would

 represen t the third patient enrolled at site SCI.  Assigned  subject  numbers  will only be used 
once.   If a patient  should  be a screen  failure,  that number  will be resigned  and the next patient  
assigned  the sequential  number  until enrollment  is met.  If a subject  receives  any part of the 
investigation  treatment  design  and must  discontinue  treatment  for any reason,  they will not be 
replaced.  
To register  a subject,  the following  documents  must  be on file with the research  nurse  or data 
manager:  
 Signed  subject  consent/HIPAA authorization  form  
 Copy  of required  laboratory  test results  
 Copy  of the pathology  report  confirming high risk superficial  transitional cell 
carcinoma  histology  
 Copy  of the most  recent  history  and physical  dictation/record  
 Any other  documentation  needed  to verify  inclusion/  exclusion  criteria  
The research nurse or data manager will verify eligibility with the Principal  Investigator.  To 
complete the registration process, the Project Manager will:  
 Assign  a subject  study  number  
 Register  the subject  on the study  
8.1.1.8  Trial Compliance  
Subjects  who, in the opinion  of the treating  Investigator  and study  staff,  would  not be 
compliant  with study  procedures  and requirements  should  not be enrolled  in the study.   
Patients who “no show” for more than 1 required visit for non -emergent or non -health related 
events may be considered non -compliant and discontinued from the study at the discretion of 
the treating Investigator . 
8.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
Subjects diagnosed with T1 and Ta tumors require restaging after failure of BCG and one 
course of maintenance or failure after BCG plus one of the following: mitomycin, 
gemcitabine, or BCG/interferon .  Subjects receiving bladder tumor resection at outside 
institutions are eligible for  the study ; however, pathology slides must be reviewed by the 
site’s pathology department .  Each subject  will receive a total of 6 cycles of treatment with 
MK-3475 at a dose of 100 (first 3 subjects) or 200 mg  on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle .  Two 
cycles of MK -3475 will occur prior to BCG intravesical treatment (weekly doses for 6 
weeks) with concurrent treatment (MK -3475 and BCG) starting on cycle 3 and ending the 
third week of cycle 4.  MK-3475 will then be continued as a single agent for  2 additio nal 
cycles after the last dose of BCG was administered .

Page 45 of 89 
 8.1.2.1  Transurethral Resection of Tumor  
Trans urethral resection of bladder tumor is routine care for this population .  Generally 
superficial bladder cancer subjects have 2 such resections as routine care  prior to initial BCG 
therapy .  The first  generally occurs after cystoscopy and confirmation of malignancy via 
biopsy.  The second generally occurs approximately 6 weeks  following the first  resection ; 
however, timing may be extended if the subject is refer red from an external clinic.  A repeat  
resection may occur as part of restaging for recurrent/persistent disease  after failed 
intervesical therapy to confirm pathology and cytology for localized  high grade (G3) 
transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial carci noma) of the bladder that is stage Ta, T1, and/or 
CIS. 
8.1.2.2  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new 
or worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently , if clinically 
indicated.  Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during 
the follow -up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 ( Appendix E).  Toxicities will be 
characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken 
with regard to trial treatment.  AEs will be recorded  from the time the subject signs  the 
consent through 30 days post the last study treatme nt. 
Please refer to section 9.0 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of 
AEs.  
8.1.2.3  Full Physical Exam ination  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam ination  
including vital signs (heart rate, blood p ressure, temperature, respiratory rate)  during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history.  A full physical exam ination  should  be performed during screening  and the 30 day 
Safety Visit . 
8.1.2.4  Directed Ph ysical Exam ination  
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam ination  per the Trial Flow Chart, the 
Investigator  or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam ination  as clinically 
indicated prior to trial treatment administration.  Directed physical exam ination s will also 
collect vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate.  
8.1.2.5  Vital Signs  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dos e of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 7.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respiratory 
rate, weight and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only.

 8.1.2.6  Eastern Coope rative Oncology Group ( ECOG)  Performance Scale  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will assess ECOG status ( Appendix A ) at screening, 
prior to the administration of trial treatment at Week 7, Week 13, Week 19 and 
discontinuation of trial treatment  or Sa fety Follow up visit  as specified in the Trial Flow 
Chart.  
8.1.2.7  Twelve -Lead Electrocardiograms  (ECG)  
During the screening period, a 12 -lead ECG will be performed with the subject in a 
recumbent or semi -recumbent position after 5 minutes of rest.  Interpretation may be by the 
Investigator  or a qualified designee.   ECGs completed within 90 days of the screening visit 
will be acceptable for the study, unless a suspected cardiac event has occurred in that 90 day 
period.  
8.1.2.8  Chest X -Ray 
A chest X-ray, both PA and lateral views, will occur at screening to confirm non -metastatic 
disease as well as to provide a baseline evaluation for pulmonary status.   X-Rays completed 
within the 90 days prior to the screening visit are acceptable.  
8.1.2.9  Pulmonary Function Tests  (PFT) 
Baseline PFTs will occur at screening to assess lung volume, capacity, rate of flow, and gas 
exchange.  Throughout the course of the study , additional PFTs will be performed if 
clinically indicated.  If DLCO decreases by greater than 10% , the subject wi ll be considered 
to have interstitial lung disease if no other obvious reason for the decrease.  The following 
will be collected:  
 Vital Capacity (VC)  
 Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)  
 Total Lung Capacity  
 Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)  
 Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV)  
 Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)  
8.1.3 Laboratory Procedures/Assessments  
Details regarding specific laboratory procedures/assessments to be performed in this trial are 
provided below.  The total amount of blood/tissue to be drawn/collected over the course of 
the trial (from pre -trial to post -trial visits), including approximate  blood/tissue volumes 
drawn/collected by visit and by sample type per subject can be found in the Procedures

 8.1.3.2  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Evaluations  
Serum and whole blood will be collected at screening and at Week 19  for possible 
pharmacodynamics evaluation.  No pharmacokinetic studies are scheduled for this study.  
Specimens may be stored until completion of study at local site.  
8.1.3.2.1  Blood Colle ction for Serum MK -3475  
Sample collection, storage and shipment instructions for serum samples will be provided in 
the Procedure Manual.   Specimens may be stored until completion of study at local site.  
The time  points for  blood sampling are described in S ection 7 – Trial Flow Chart.  
8.1.3.2.2  Blood Collection for Anti -MK-3475 Antibodies  
Sample collection, storage , and shipment instructions for blood samples will be provided in 
the Procedure Manual.   The time points for blood sampling are described in Section 7 – Trial 
Flow Chart.   Specimens may be stored until completion of study at local site.  
8.1.4 Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  
Chest X-ray, computerized tomography ( CT) urogram or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 
urogram are allowed to ascertain the superf icial nature of the disease when indicated 
according to the standard of care.  If urogram protocol not available or contrast allergy/poor 
renal function preclude such imaging, then non -contrast CT or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis 
within 90 days of study entry will suffice.  
Disease assessment will occur via a n evaluation under anesthesia with cystoscopy, cytology, 
and random bladder biopsies (if indicated for positive findings on cystoscopy or cytology).  
Assessment will be performed at week 19 (approximately 6 weeks after the last dose of BCG 
treatment) .  Assessment will also occur at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 
months, and 24 months post treatment visit as per standard of care for the local site .  Due to 
recurrence or maintenance therapy, it is expected that assessments may not fit exactly at 
these time points.  If assessment not completed at that time point , indicate not done on the 
case report form.  
8.1.5 Correlative Studies Specimen Collection  
Tumor ti ssue will be collected at time of clinical biopsy  (archival specimen will suffice)  at 
baseline  during transurethral bladder resection  (if possible)  and at Week 19 , if a biopsy is 
clinically indicated.  A minimum of 10 paraffin embedded slides are needed  for baseline 
evaluation.  Serum, whole blood, and urine will be collected at baseline prior to Day 1 , Cycle 
1 treatment , Week 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, prior to treatment  and at Week 19 prior to 
cystoscopy.  Saliva will be collected at baseline only. Sample collection, storage and 
shipment instructions for blood and urine samples will be provided in the Procedures 
Manual.   If subjects are followed locally, specimens will be collected if available at 3 month , 
6 month, 9 month, 12 month, 18 month, and 24 month post treatment completion  visits .

When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any 
adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawa l should be 
followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 9.0 − Assessing and 
Recording Adverse Events.  
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, and without prejudice to 
further treatment.    In addition, patients can be withdrawn by the Investigator  because of 
unacceptable toxicity.    Patients who are withdrawn or are removed from the study will be 
required to have an off -study clinic v isit at the time of discontinuation, and a 30 -day follow -
up safety visit.  
Subjects  can be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
Adverse Event:  If a subject  suffers an adverse event, which in the judgment of the 
Investigator, the Study Sponsor, or the Data Safety Review Team  presents an 
unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject , the subject  can be withdrawn from 
the study.  
Administrative:  After consultation, a subject  can be withdrawn from the study for 
the following administr ative reasons: 1) failure to complete the protocol -specified 
evaluations or 2) failure to comply with protocol requirements.  
Withdrawal of Informed Consent:  A subject  can withdraw his consent to 
participate in the study at his own request or be withdrawn f rom participation in the 
study at the request of his legally authorized representative at any time for any reason.  
Evidence of Progressive Disease:  The Investigator  can withdraw a subject  from the 
study if there is a CT scan, MRI or other modality -confirme d progression of disease , 
but continue to collect follow -up data for safety and overall survival as per protocol.  
Subject s must  be withdrawn/ discontinued from the treatment for the following reasons:  
 The subject has i ntercurrent illness that prevents further administration of 
treatment . 
 The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test . 
 The subject is lost to follow -up.

 8.1.6.1  Screening  
8.1.6.1.1  Screening Period  
The screening period covers the 90 days prior to Day 1 , Cycle 1.  Days −90 through −28 will 
include restaging for Ta and T1 tumors . 
The study screening visit is mandatory and must  occur in the 28 days prior to Day 1 , Cycle 1 
of treatment.  The study screening visit includes full study informed consent and 
documentation of consent.  No study required procedures (excluding those that are standard 
of care) are to occur prior to inform ed consent of the subject.  All inclusion/exclusion criteria 
must be reviewed and all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria must be met to 
advance the subject on to the Treatment Period.  The screening period procedures include: 
full study in formed consent, review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of 
demographics and medical history, concomitant medication review, cystoscopy and urine 
cytology, including restaging of tumor for Ta and T1 , review of ongoing symptoms for 
documentatio n of baseline adverse effects, full physical examina tion, ECOG performance 
status, v ital signs, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and baseline pulmonary function tests  as 
well as laboratory assessments indicated in Section 7−Trial Flow Chart .  Collection of a 
baseline bladder cancer tumor specimen, as well as baseline blood and urine specimens for 
correlative studies , will also occur during the screening period.  Assessment of coagulation 
status will be performed prior to each res ection as per standard of car e. 
8.1.6.2  Treatment Period  
8.1.6.2.1  Dose Escalation  
The first 3 enrolled patients will be treated with 100 mg of MK -3475 every 3 weeks for 6 
cycles.  If one subject of the three require s the dose of MK -3475 to be withheld or 
discontinued, the 100 mg cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects.  If two out of three or two 
out of six subjects develop toxicity that requires the dose to be withheld or discontinued, the 
dose will be not be escalated to 200 mg MK -3475 every  3 weeks.  All remaining subjects 
will be treated at 100 mg MK -3475 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.  
Physical examination and assessment of toxicity will be performed before each 
administration of MK -3475.  A CBC will be obtained on Day 1 of every 3 -week cycle.   
Biochemistry panel examining electrolytes, and liver enzymes will be performed on Day 1 , 
Cycle 1  of MK -3475, at Weeks 7, 10  and 13, and at the end of therapy  (Week 19) .  
Treatment will not proceed unless laboratory values are acceptable.  Urinalysis will  occur at 
weeks 7 -12 prior to each BCG treatment.  BCG treatment will not proceed unless urinalysis 
results are acceptable.   Collect and record non -serious and serious adverse events and 
assignment of toxi city grade (NCI CTCAE, Version 4) at each visit.  Collect and record any 
changes in concomitant mediation.  
Product:   MK-3475

Page 52 of 89 
 Subjects will be provided with an oral thermometer and a diary (Appendix H) to document 
twice daily oral temperatures.  The diary will also ask for documentation of other symptoms 
to help monitor for systemic infection of BCG.  
The AUA IPSS and QOL questionnaires are to b e administered at Day 1 Cycle 1 and  Week 
10 visit prior to any study procedures.  
8.1.6.2.3  Phone Monitoring  
To monitor for systemic BCG infection, subjects will be called daily on days 2 -4 of each 
BCG treatment cycle (Weeks 7 -12).  Subjects will be queried on symptoms which may 
indicate  systemic infection .  If clinically indicated, subject will be seen and clini cally worked 
up for systemic infection and treatment started as indicated.  
8.1.6.3  Unplanned Visits  
Unplanned visit  information will be collected as well.  Information collected will include: 
disease symptoms and assessment/status, laboratory /imaging  assessments, and toxicity 
assessments.  
8.1.6.4  Post-Treatment Visits  
An evaluation under anesthesia with cystoscopy, cytology, and random bladder biopsies (if 
indicated for positive findings on cystoscopy or cytology) will be performed at Week 19 
(approximately 6 week s after t he last dose of BCG)  to assess for response.   Physical 
examination, performance status, as well as vital signs , will also be assessed at the Week 19 
visit.  Laboratory assessments will include hematology and chemistry as outlined in Section 7 
– Trial Flow Chart and Table 7.  Coagulation assessment (PT/PTT/INR) will be re -assessed , 
if resection/biopsy is indicated.  Specimens need ed for correlative studies will again be 
collected, including blood, urine, saliva and tumor (if biopsy is performed).  The collection, 
storage , and processing of laboratory samples are detailed in the Procedure Manual.  
The AUA IPSS and QOL questionnaires are also to be administered at Week 19  visit prior to 
any study procedures.  
8.1.6.5  Treatment Discontinuation/Safety Follow -Up Visit  
The Treatment Discontinuation Visit and Safety Follow -Up Visit include identical 
procedures and assessments.  Subjects withdrawn f rom treatment prior to completion of the 
Treatment Period should undergo a Discontinuation Visit for safety purposes and  may occur 
any time within 30 days of the subject discontinuing treatment, but preferably prior to the 
subject initiating a new treatment.  The mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit should be 
conducted approximately 30 days after the last dose of trial treatmen t or before the initiation 
of a new anti -cancer treatment, whichever comes first.  All AEs that occur prior to the Safety 
Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  Subjects with an AE of Grade >1 will be followed until 
the resolution of the AE to Grade 0 -1 or u ntil the beginning of a new anti -neoplastic therapy, 
Product:   MK-3475  
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 53 of 89 
 whichever occurs first.  SAEs that occur within 30 days of the end of treatment or before 
initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment should also be followed and recorded.  
Assessments at the Discontinuatio n/Safety Follow -Up Visit include a full physical 
examination, ECOG Performance Status and vital signs.  Laboratory assessments include 
hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis, as well as evaluation of thyroid function.  
Concomitant medications and toxicity a ssessment will be recorded as well.  
8.1.6.6  Follow -up Visits  
Subjects who complete all study treatment or discontinue trial treatment for a reason other 
than disease progression will move into the Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed at 19 
week cystoscopy .  Additional follow up information will be collected at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 
24 months post completion of treatment.  Every effort should be made to collect infor mation 
regarding disease status, start of new anti -neoplastic therapy, disease recurrence, disea se 
progression, death, or end of the study .  Information regarding post -study anti -neoplastic 
treatment will be collected if new treatment is initiated.  
A final set of AUA IPSS and QOL questionnaires are also to be administered at the 3 month 
Follow Up visit.  
9.0 ASSESSING AND RECORD ING ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relations hip with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -
specified pro cedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associ ated with  the 
use of the  investigational product, is also an adverse event.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  
Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and 
children and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time.  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of investigational  product in clin ical 
trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), 
from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Progression of the cancer under study is n ot considered an adverse event.  
All adverse  events that occur after the consent  form is signed , but before treatment 
allocation /randomization , must be reported by the Investigator  if they cause the subject to be 
excluded from the trial, or are the  result of a protocol -specified intervention, including , but 
Product:   MK-3475  
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 54 of 89 
 not limited to , washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a 
procedure.  
From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 30 days following cessation of 
treatment , all adverse events must be reported by the I nvestigator.  Such events will be 
recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.   The 
reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious crit eria is described in section 
9.1.3.1. 
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screeni ng period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any 
protocol -specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh 
tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide con sent to the main study and AEs 
will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
9.1.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to 
the Sponsor  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exce eding the prescribed 
dose for MK -3475 by 20% over the prescribed dose  and an overdose of BCG is considered 
more than one vial of BCG administered per instillation , unless a greater number of vials are 
prescribed due to multi -focal disease . 
In the event of an overdose, the event should be reported to the Sponsor and the  subject 
should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be 
provided , if clinically indicated.   No specific information is available on the treatment  of 
overdose of MK -3475.   If over dosage of BCG occurs, the patient should be closely 
monitored for signs of active local or systemic BCG infection.  For acute local or systemic 
reactions suggesting active infection, an infectious disease specialist experi enced in BCG 
complications should be consulted.  
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a study  drug, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria 
are met.  
If a dose o f an investigational product  meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is 
reported as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “ac cidental 
or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours 
to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to the manufacturer’s safety division  (For Merck 
products this is Merck Global Safety, Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) .

 9.1.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
Investigators or their designees to  report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject 
(spontaneously reported to them), that occurs during the trial . 
Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed , but before treatment 
allocation/randomization , must be reported by the Investigator  if they cause the subject to be 
excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including , but 
not limited to , washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a 
procedure.  
Pregnancies and  lactations that o ccur from the time of treatment a llocation/randomization 
through 120 days , or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new 
anti-cancer therapy, whichever is earlier , must be reported by the I nvestigator .  All subjects 
and female partners of male subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, 
missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intr auterine death, 
miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events).  If 
the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor  and within 2 working days to 
the product’s manufacturer safety division . 
9.1.3 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
9.1.3.1  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring while the subject is enrolled into the 
study that: 
 Results in death;  
 Is life threatening;  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization;  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Is another important medical event  
Note:  In addition to  the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below 
criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Merck in 
the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements.  Therefore, 
these events are considered serious  by Merck for collection purposes.  
● Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);  
● Is associated with an overdose.  
 
Product:   MK-3475  
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 56 of 89 
 Refer to Table 8 for additional details regarding each of the above criteria.  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it results in 
hospitalization or death.  
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment 
allocation/randomization, any  serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, 
including  death due to any cause other than progression of the cance r under study , that occurs 
to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to 
Merck Global Safety if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or  is the result of a 
protocol -specified intervention, including , but not limited to , washout or discontinuation of 
usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization  through 90 days 
following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject 
initiates  new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any serious adverse event, or follow up 
to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other tha n progression of the 
cancer under study, whether or not related to the investigatio nal product, must be reported 
within 24 hours to the Sponsor  (and Merck Global Safety if a Merck product .) 
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by a qualified  physician to be related to 
the investigational product that is brought to the attention of the Investigator  at any time also 
must be reported immediately to the Sponsor  and to product’s manufacturer . 
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the FDA 
and the drug manufacturer’s safety division, as appropriate  (Merck Global Safety 
facsimile number:  +1 -215-993-1220 ). 
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports are to be submitted as required 
by FDA, or other l ocal regulators.  Investigators will cross reference this submission 
according to local regulations to the Merck Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, 
etc.) at the time of submission.  Additionally Investigators will submit a copy of these reports 
to Merck & Co., Inc. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) at the time of 
submission to FDA.  
9.1.3.2  Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest 
(ECI) and must be reported with in 24 hours to  the Sponsor and within 2 working days to the 
product manufacturer safety division . 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment 
allocation/randomization , any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any su bject must be 
reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety if 
it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol -specified

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 57 of 89 
 intervention, including , but not limited to , washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, 
placebo treatment or a procedure.  
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through 90 days 
following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject 
initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, 
whether  or not related to Merck  product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor  and 
within 24 hours to Merck Global Safety.  
Events of clinical interest for this tr ial include:  
1. An overdose of study drug , as defined in Section 9.1.1 - Definition of an Overdose for 
this P rotocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor, that is not associated with 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  
2. An elevated AST or ALT lab oratory  value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper 
limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab oratory  value that is greater than or 
equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase 
laboratory  value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of 
protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents.  The 
purpose of the criteri a is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that 
may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology . 
9.1.3.3  Protocol -Specific Exceptions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to Merck as described in 
Section 9.1.3 - Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to Merck, unless 
there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event.   Any such 
event will be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to Merck Global Safety within 2 
working days either by electronic or paper media.  
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is 
disease progression of the cancer under study.  
The Sponsor will monito r unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to 
ensure the safety of the subjects in the trial.  Any suspected endpoint which upon review is 
not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Merck Global Safety as a SAE 
within 2 working days of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under 
study  
Hospitalization related to convenience (e.g. , transportation issues etc.) will not be considered 
a SAE.

 9.1.4 Evaluating Adverse Events  
An Investigator  who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.  Any adverse event 
which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of 
grade re corded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets.  
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.

 Table 8: Evaluating Adverse Events  
An Investigator  who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mi ld symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention  indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation or hospitalization indicated; 
disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring while the subject is enrolled into the study : 
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This doe s not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization  (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless  of length of stay, even if the 
hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened is not a serious adverse event.  A pre -existing c ondition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a Merck product and is documented in 
the patient’s medical history.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagno sis);or  
 Is a new cancer;  (that is not a condition of the study)  or) (although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to Merck within 2 
working days to meet certain local requirements); or 
 Is an overdose  (whethe r accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event , for collection purposes .   
An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical interest a nd must be reported within 24 hours  to the Sponsor and 
to Merck within 2 working days.  
 Other important medical events  that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse eve nt when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical interve ntion to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of time and units  
Action taken  Did the adverse event cau se Merck  product to be discontinued?  
Relationship 
Merck Product   Did the product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that Merck  product caused the adverse event will be provided by an Investigator  who is 
a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causali ty noted on the AE form, ensures that a 
medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must b e retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the Investigator  in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the 
available informa tion.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between Merck  product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely Merck  product caused the  adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance asses sment (pill count, 
diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite i n bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of Merck  product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
Product:   MK-3475 60 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 60 of 89 
  Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or  environmental 
factors  
 
Relationship  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (continued)  
to Merck 
Product  
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was Merck  product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improve d despite continuation 
of the Sponsor’s product; or (3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor’s produ ct(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to the product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is  a single -dose drug trial); or 
(3) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERS E EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN 
CAUSED BY THE PRODUCT, OR IF REEXPOSURE TO MERCK  PRODUCT  POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK 
TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR  AS PER DOSE 
MODIFICATION GUIDELINES IN THE PROTOCOL.  
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment 
Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding Merck product or drug class pharmacology or 
toxicology?  
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by an Investigator  who is a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, including 
consideration of the above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be indicative of a product relationship).  
Yes, there is a reasonable 
possibility of product relationship.  There is evidence of exposure to Merck  product.  The temporal sequ ence of the AE onset relative to the administration of Merck  product is 
reasonable.  The AE is more likely explained by Merck  product than by another cause.  
No, there is not a reasonable 
possibility of Merck product 
relationship  Subject did not receive the product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of Merck  product is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely explained by another cause than the Merck product.   (Also entered for a subject with overdose w ithout an associated AE.)

 9.1.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and Investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.   If appropriate , adverse events will be 
reported to the drug manufacturer’s safety division.  
10.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
10.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
A minimum of 15 subjects will be enrolled.  Seventy percent of bladder tumors are superficial 
[22] indicating to enroll at least 15 patients , approximately 21 -25 patients will need to be 
approached to meet eligibility and to allow for patient disinterest.  
Fifty percent of those patients wh o respond to BCG treatment develop recurrent disease [30; 31]  
generally detected within 6 months of BCG tre atment.  Those patients with recurrent disease 
often are sent for radical cystectomy as there are no other acceptable standard treatment options.  
This study, though primarily evaluating maximum tolerated dose, will ex amine the percent 
response at 19  weeks to determine if MK -3475 has altered the patt ern of responders as early as 
19 weeks from the start of treatment.  The results of this study will not only examine the safety  
of combining MK-3475  with BCG  for future studies , but will also assist in determin ing patient 
eligibility (recurrent superficial bladder cancer versus initial diagnosis) and considerations for 
future study  design . 
Patient related data will be collected and transferred to an excel spreadsheet for statistical 
analysis.  SAS software versio n 9.4 will be used for all data analysis.  Descriptive statistics will 
be computed for all study variables.  Continuous variables will be described with measures of 
central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (range, standard deviation).   Categorical 
variables will be summarized as frequencies and percentages.  Some examples include tumor 
stage (Ta, T1, Cis), age, ECOG Performance Scale (0, 1, 2), sex, and use of tobacco and alcohol.  
For primary objective 1, the proportion of patients with each AE will b e reported along with the 
NCI CTCAE Grade of the AE.   The Quality of Life Questionnaire, which includes one question 
with seven categorical responses, will be described with frequencies  and percentages.  The 
American Urologic Association Symptoms Index Questionnaire, which includes seven questions 
each with a numerical score between 0 and 5 as well as a final numerical sum of all responses, 
will be described with measures of central tendency and dispersion.  Due to the questionnaires 
being given at three  time points (Pre -treatment, Mid -treatment, and Post -treatment), the 
responses may be analyzed to look for longitudinal effects over time for specific variables of 
interest with repeated measures ANOVA to evaluate changes and control for individual 
differe nces ( although this would be very low power  due to n=15 ). 
For the secondary objective, subjects will be assessed at 19 weeks , 3 months, 12 months, and 24 
months post treatment completion  for complete response .  The outcome endpoint will be 
complete respons e status at 19 weeks , 3 months, 12 months, and 24 months post treatment to 
measure  complete response , recorded as yes or no and summarized as proportions and a percent.

 These proportions/percent will be reported, but no stati stical analysis will be perfor med as this is 
a single arm phase I study, and no control group is available for direct comparison.  
For the exploratory objectives, Pearson or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient will be used to 
estimate correlations between expression level change and  treatment outcome, as well as the 
correlations between mutation presence and treatment outcome.

Calculation of CKD -EPI GFR  
http://www.qxmd.com/calculate -online/nephrology/ckd -epi-egfr 
The CKD -EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation was developed in 
an effort to create a formula more precise than the MDRD formula, especially w hen actual GFR 
is > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2.  Researchers pooled data from multiple studies to develop and 
validate this new equation.  They randomly divided 10 studies , which included 8,254 
participants, into separate data sets for development and internal validation.  Sixteen ( 16) 
additional studies, which included 3,896 participants, were used for external validation.  The 
CKD -EPI equation performed better than the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
Study) equation, especially at higher GFR, with less bias and greater accuracy.  When looking at 
NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data, the median estimated GFR 
was 94.5 mL/min per 1.73 m2 vs. 85.0 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and the prevalence of chronic kidney 
disease was 11.5% versus  13.1%.  The CKD -EPI equation, expressed as a single equation, is:  
GFR = 141 X min(Scr/κ,1)α X max(Scr/κ,1)-1.209 X 0.993Age X 1.018 [if female] X 1.159 [if 
black]  
Where Scr is serum creatinine (mg/dL), κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is –0.329 for 
females and –0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max indicates the 
maximum of Scr/κ or 1.

Basic Science Correlates  
Objective1.  Staining for PD-1, PDL-1, and CD3 in bladder tissue samples 
obtained at initial tumor resection and on follow up biopsies  
Immunohistochemistry for PD -1, PD -L1, and CD3 in tissue from pretreatment biopsy and tumor 
resection will be performed to investigate the association between tissue expression of these 
markers and response to MK-3475 .  When preparing and submitting slides,  newly cut sections 
will be utilized to ensure stability of the PD -L1 epitope.   Staining for immunohistochemistry for 
markers of interest will involve baking formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections for 45 
minutes at 60 °C, then deparaffinized and rehydrated with serial passage through changes of 
xylene and graded ethanols.  All slides will be subjected to heat induced epitope retrieval in 
either Envision FLEX Target Retrieval Solution, High pH (cat K8012, Dako, Carpineteria CA) 
or Target Retrieval Solution, pH 6.1 (cat S1699, Dako).  Endogenous peroxidase in tissues will 
be blocked by incubation of slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution prior to incubation with 
primary antibody (anti -PD-L1 clone 22C3, Merck Research Laboratories, Palo Alto CA; anti -
PD-1 clone NAT105, Cell Marque, Rocklin CA; or anti -CD3 clone F7.2.38, Dako) for 60 
minutes.   Antigen -antibody binding will be detected using polymer -based methods and 
visualized by application of 3,3' diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen (K4368, Dako).    Stained 
slides will be counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped for review and scoring by a 
pathologist employing a semiquantitative 0 -5 scale.  
Specimens collected from biopsy (formalin fixed tissue blocks and slides) obtained at baseline 
(utilizing the specimen ICF form or the main study ICF) and Week 19 (main study ICF) will be 
utilized for the completion of Basic Science Correlates, Objective 1.  
Objective 2.  Whole exome sequencing of germline DNA and formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue on all  patients.  Correlation will be made to mutations 
and treatment outcomes.  
The study Investigators are submitting a protocol that allows for DNA collection from 
genitourinary cancer patients.  The same protocol will allow for collection of clinical data and  
DNA sequencing using next generation technology from patients who received MK-3475 .  
Pathology reports from pre - and post -MK-3475  tumor resections and biopsies will be obtained.  
Response/no response to MK-3475  will be ascertained from the collected clini cal data using 
definitions of response agreed on for high risk superficial bladder cancer.  Germline DNA from 
patients with a complete set of data will be sequenced using next generation sequencing (exome 
sequencing at 40x) provided by industrial vendors ( such as www.edgebio.com).  Data from next 
generation sequencing will be analyzed using software provided by Ingenuity Inc. 
(www.ingenuity.com).  Variants will be analyzed both in an agnostic and non -agnostic manners.  
Any genes reported in the literature t o be associated with response to PDL -1 therapy will be 
examined to agnostically identify variants within these genes shared between responders/no 
responders to MK-3475  at a significant level.  In addition, genetic variants common to 
responders/non responde rs and unrelated to genes identified previously in the literature as being 
Product:   MK-3475 80 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 80 of 89 
 related to PDL -1 response will be examined (non -agnostic analysis).  Such non -agnostic variants 
will be also considered as important targets for biomarker development if they are si gnificantly 
associated with response/no response to treatment.  Variants associated with response/no 
response will be then validated in the discovery cohort using sequenome analysis 
(www.sequenome.com ) as agreed upo n in the scientific methodology of such studies to avoid 
replicating variants that do not actually exist in the sampled DNA.  
Specimens (including tumor and surrounding normal tissue, whole blood, serum, and urine) will 
be collected for future unspecified r esearch if the subject agrees to collection and storage for 
future unspecified research.  Specimens may come from subjects fully enrolled in the treatment 
portion of the study at baseline and Week 19.  Specimens may also be obtained from subjects 
who have declined the treatment portion of the study or were ineligible , but gave permission for 
use of specimens despite not being enrolled into the treatment portion of the study.  The 
specimens will be stored until completely utilized or for 50 years, whichever occurs first.  These 
specimens will be utilized for completion of Basic Science Correlatives, Objective 2 if funding is 
secured or for other studies which may become apparent throughout the study, for example, 
development of a urine based assay for respons e assessment.  Not all studies have been identified 
at this time.  
Objective 3.  Immune -profiling of bladder exudate and blood from patients treated 
with combination of BCG and pembrolizumab for high risk transitional cell 
carcinoma of the bladder  
Bladder ca ncer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States. (1) The majority of 
diagnoses are non -muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), however a significant proportion of 
these cases will recur and some  will ultimately become muscle invasive. (2) Thus, prevention of 
post-transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) recurrence of intermediate risk NMIBC 
would represent a major step towards reduction of bladder cancer mortality. Intravesical 
instillation of BCG represents first line treatment for NMIBC and is effective in preventing 
recurrence of superficial disease. (3) This is thought to elicit an immune reaction and the release 
of cytokines that active an immune response from neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells. (3)  
Recently, there have been advances in the treatment of advanced bladder tumors with agents 
targeting the programmed cell death protein (PD -1)/programmed cell death ligand (PDL -1) 
checkpoint pathway. (4) By blocking this pathway, a greater antitumor response by T cells is 
created resulting in incre ased bladder cancer cell immune mediated destruction. (5) We have  a 
phase I clinical study examining the results of combining pembrolizumab, a monoclonal anti -
PD1 antibody, with BCG treatments. In these patients, we have collected both urine and blood 
pre- and post -treatment. The urine in these patients contains the bla dder inflammatory exudate 
that developed during treatment. We hypothesize that  the understanding of  how combined 
BCG and pembrolizumab treatment affect the local (bladder exudate in urine) and 
systemic (blood) immune environment could be obtained from immu ne-profiling bodily 
fluids of our trial patients.  
Our collaborator, Dr Bruce Patterson from IncellDx has developed a high parameter flow 
cytometry assay for immune profiling in solid tumors and urine. In a lung study that combined 
primary tumor immune pro filing and Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) analysis, they were able to

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 81 of 89 
 identify both drug targets in the primary tumors and factors in the primary tumor that diminished 
immune control of tumor cells that led to detection of CTCs especially CTCs expressing PD -L1. 
We will use the patient samples derived from our phase I study and perform high parameter (>20 
markers)  analysis of urine and blood samples,  below, both pre - and post -treatment  to quantify the  
 
 immune cell sub -populations to create an immune profile. Furthermore, we will analyze serum 
cytokines to further establish immune response in patients. We will also compare the immune 
profiles for treatment responders and non -responders to determine if there are biomarkers for 
predicting respo nse to this combined treatment modality much like we had done previously to 
identify immune control in the lung (below).  
 
 
We will use the patient samples derived from our phase I study and perform FACS analysis to 
sort urine and blood samples, both pre - and post -treatment, into immune cell sub -populations to 
create an immune profile. Furthermore, we will analyze serum cytokines to further establish

 immune response in patients. We will also compare the immune profiles for treatment responders 
and non -respon ders to determine if there are biomarkers for predicting response to this combined 
treatment modality.  
We will utilize patient samples from a single arm phase I study in which patients with high risk 
bladder cancer are enrolled. Patients will receive TURB T for their bladder tumor as a standard of 
care treatment for their disease, followed by treatment of 200mg IV of pembrolizumab every 3 
weeks. These cycles will overlap with BCG treatment for 6 weeks that were initiated no later 
than 2 weeks after TURBT. P atients will have follow up with cystoscopy every 3 months for one 
year. Response at one year will be decided based on negative cytology and cystoscopy for 
bladder cancer. Pre - and post -treatment urine containing bladder exudate and blood will be spun 
down  to isolate immune cells, which will be prepared for flow cytometric analysis. Antibodies to 
markers of T -cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, RORT), B-cells (CD19, CD20, Ig, ĸ), NK cells (CD56, 
CD16), Macrophages (CD14, CD33), and Dendritic Cells (CD11c, CD123, HLA -DR). In 
addition, we will perform Luminex Assays on patient serum samples to determine cytokine 
profiling (IL -1beta, IL -1ra, IL -2, IL -4, IL -6, IL -8, IL -10, IL -13, IL -17A, GM -CSF, IFN -gamma, 
TNF -alpha). We will examine immune profiles pre - and post - treatments as well as comparing 
the immune profiles between patients that respond to treatment (ie no tumor recurrence) with 
patients that have tumor recurrence.  
Bladder C irculating Tumor Cell Enumeration  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Whole blood (8mL ) will be drawn from patients . These samples will be run on the Celsee 
CelSelect enumeration chip to quantify the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the 
patients ’ pre-and post -treatment  samples . The captured circulating tumor cells will be stained for 
PD-L1 and CCR5 to identify potential targets to eliminate metastasis.

Potential experimental difficulties and alternative approaches  
We do not foresee a ny technical issues with regard to performing the experimental approaches. 
Our collaborator’s laboratory is experienced in isolating immune cells from patient samples and 
performing FACS analysis. The antibodies we intend to use for staining have all been tested. 
Though the fundamental groundwork for success may be in place, potential pitfalls may always 
arise.  
Even though we plan to spin down samples, this does not necessarily mean cells will be present 
in sufficient numbers to perform our experiments. Giv en most patient samples were collected 
and frozen prior to analysis, there is risk of cell lysis compromising analysis. If this occurs, we 
may be required to change buffering solutions used prior to freezing.

1.1 Abnormal Fetal  Growth or Amniotic Fluid in 3rd Trimester 
 
Abnormal fetal growth is defined as an estimate of less than 10% (fetal growth restriction; FGR) 
or greater than 90% (excessive gr owth) for gestational age.  Amniotic fluid is considered to be 
low (oligo hydramnios) if the single deepest vertical pocket is less than 2 cm or if amniotic  fluid 
index is less than 5.0 cm, and it is regarded as being excessive  (polyhydramnios) if the single 
deepest vertical pocket is gre ater than 8 cm or if the amniotic fluid index is >  24 cm. The reason 
for accurately identifying these 4 conditions is that they are linked with adverse pregnancy 
outcomes, also known as peripartum complications. FGR,  for exam ple, is  associa ted with 
stillbirth, cesarean for non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, neonatal seizure, sepsis, and 
neonatal death. Excessive fetal growth, also known as large for gestational age (LGA), or 
macr osomia,  is associa ted with prolonged labor, cesarean delivery,  traumatic birth, neurologic 
injury and death. Oligo hydramnios is associa ted with stillbirth, emergency cesarean delive ry, 
low Apgar score, and fetal anomali es. Lastly, polyhydramnios is  associated with abruption, 
stillbirth, and postpartum hemorrhage (Table 1).  
 
To minimize the complications with these four conditions, clinicians in the 3rd trimester have to 
identify these pregnancies, start antepartum surveilla nce, and time the delive ry based on 
gestational age and the results of surveill ance (Table 1).

1.2 Current Methods of D etecting Abnormal Fetal Growth or Amniotic Fluid 
 
The current guidelines by American  College  of Obstetricia ns and Gynecologists  (ACOG) indicate 
that women without complications or co-morbidities s hould have their fundal height measured 
at prenatal visits. If the difference between fundal height and gestational age  is 3 or more then 
ultrasound exam  (USE)  consisting of fetal growth and assess ment of amniotic fluid should be 
undertaken (7). 
 
When performing USE  based  on indications the detection of abnormal growth is poor because 
majori ty are undetected. A summa ry of 7 publications from 6 countries indicates that only 1 out 
of 3 FGR infants were identified before birth (Table 2). Simil arly, Heywood et al  reported that at 
a  teaching  hospital,  only  11%  of  newb orns  with  excessive  gr owth  were  identified  before 
delive ry. Alternatively if  ultrasound exam  is done within 4 weeks of delive ry, then over  60% of 
abnormal growth is identified (19). A recent m ulti-center pilot rand omized trial among 
uncomplicated pregnancies noted that with USE  in the 3rd trimester, 67% of FGR were identified 
during pregnancy compared to 9% with routine care; 80% of LGA were identified with USE 
compared to 0% with routine care (20). Thus, a randomized trial is warranted to assess  if serial 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-16-0084  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  05/03/2016   USE after 30 weeks, when compared to current routine care, increases  the identification of 
abnormal conditions before birth.

2 Study Design 
 
2.1 Primary Research Question 
 
The primary research question is: In women at a ges tational age of 30 weeks or m ore without 
comorbidities, does perfor mance of seri al 3rd trimester growth ultrasounds increase the 
frequency of identifying abnormali ties in es timate of fetal growth (< 10% or > 90% for 
gestational age)  or amniotic fluid (oligo hydramnios or polyhydramnios), when compared with 
women  who only receive indicated ultrasounds? 
 
 
 
 
2.2 Secondary Research Questions 
 
 Among women with abnormal growth identified on ultrasound, what is the rate of 
newb orns with a birth weight < 10% or > 90% for gestational age?  
 What is the composite neonatal morbidity among (CNM; defined below) among women 
with seri al versus indicated USE? C NM is any of the following: 1) Apgar score < 5 at 5 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-16-0084  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  05/03/2016   min, 2) umbilical  arterial pH < 7.00, 3) intravent ricular hemorrhage grade III or IV, 4) 
periventricular leukoma lacia,  5) intubation for over 24 hrs, 6) necrotizing enterocolitis 
grade 2 or 3, 7) stillbirth or 8)  death within 28 days of birth. 
 
(Intravent ricular hemorrhage was classified by Papile’s criteriawith grade III hemorrhage 
being associa ted with ventricular dilatation and grade IV with parenchymal extension. 
Necrotizing enterocolitis was diagnosed in the presence of more than one clinical sig n, such 
as bilious gas tric aspirate or emesis,  abdominal distention, occult or gross fecal blood, and 
at least one radiographic  finding of pneumatosis intestinalis, hepatobiliary  gas, or 
pneumoperito neum.) (24) 
 
 
 
 What is the composite maternal morbidity (CMM) among those with serial vs indicated 
USE?  CMM  is defined as any of the following: 1) chorioamnionitis, 2) cesarean delive ry 
in labor, 3) wound infection, 4) transfusion, 5) deep venous thrombus or pulmonary 
embolism,  6) admission to intensive care unit or 7) death. 
 
(Chorioamnionitis defined as clinical findings of maternal fever, and maternal a nd fetal 
tachy cardia in the absence of other localizing signs of infection. Wound infection defined as 
tenderness,  erythema, or discharge  associa ted with cesarean skin incision.) (26 &2 7) 
 
2.3 Design Sum mary 
 
This is a randomized clinical trial, comparing the frequency of identification of abnormal growth 
and / or amniotic fluid among low risk women who either have serial USE vs. those who have 
clinically indicated USE.  Women  will be rand omized to one of two groups: 
 
 Group 1: routine third trimester care with clinically-indicated ultrasound (control) 
 Group  2:  ultrasound  evaluation  for  fetal  growth  and  amniotic  fluid  every  4  weeks 
starting at 30 weeks (interve ntion group). Thus, if they continue to term, there will be 3 
additional ultrasounds exams (30, 34 and 38 weeks). 
 
 
 
Eligible subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using 
permuted block rand omization in order to prevent imbalances between groups. 
 
2.4 Sample Size Calculation 
 
The definition of the primary outcome  is presence of SGA  (EFW <10%), LGA (EFW> 10%), 
oligo hydramnios, or polyhydramnios and is not based  on any outcomes  after birth. 
 
The estimate for the primary outcome  is based on the following assumptions: 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-16-0084  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  05/03/2016    In uncomplicated  pregnancies, the likelihood of identifying abnormal growth or amniotic 
fluid is 10% in the control group. 
 In  the  interventi on  group,  we  hypothesize  the  likelihood  of  detecting  abnormal 
condition to be 25%. 
 To  detect an  increase in  the primary outcome from 10% in  control to  25% in  the 
intervention gr oup with 80% power and alpha of 0.05, a total of 194 (97 in each arm) 
women  need to be randomized. 
 We estimate  that 5% of  patients will be lost to follow up based  on a previous pilot study 
(21). The total sample size will be 206 women  (103 /group) to allow for loss to follow- 
up.

2.5   Informed Consent Criteria 
Written informed consent must be obtained before  entry into the study. Full disclosure of the 
nature and potential risks of participating in the trial is to be made. A copy of the signed 
consent form for the study will be provided to the patient. 
 
Women randomized to the intervention group will not be charged for ultrasound exams which 
are part of the study design. The department al funds will pay for these exams.  If ultrasound 
abnormali ties are noted (e.g. abnormality of the fluid or growth) subsequent ultrasound  exams 
are needed, according to American  College of Obstetricia ns and Gynecology (ACOG) guidelines 
(Table 3). For these indicated ultrasound exams the insurance company will be billed and these 
exams  are not cover ed by the department al funds. 
 
Among women  in the control arm,  the ultrasound exams will be done only when indicated 
according to the ACOG guidelines. Some of the comm on indications for USE include: 1) 
difference in GA and fundal height > 3 cm; 2) new onset hypertension; 3) decre ased fetal 
movem ent; 4) spotting/ bleeding; 5) preterm premature rupture of membranes, 6) preterm 
labor; 7) maternal trauma. Since these exams  are indicated, the charges will be submitted to 
the appropriate insurance company.

3.1 Methods 3 Study Procedures 
 
After gestational diabetes is ruled out, usually by 28-30 weeks, and the woman  is confirmed to 
meet  the  eligibility  criteria,  she  will  be  approached  for  participation.  Patients  will  be 
randomized using the random permuted block randomization method using allocation tables 
created by a statistician. The sonographic exam ination will be done by a registered diagnostic 
medical sonographer (RDMS). 
 
The exam inations will be done after the prenatal visits and there will be no charges  for the 
ultrasound. No economic  burden will be imposed on participants. Co nsistent with the ACOG 
recomm endations that the sonogra phic exams  be repeated every 4 weeks, we will repeat the 
exams eve ry 4 weeks. Thus, if a women  is recruited at 30 weeks, she will have sonographic 
exami nation at 30, 34 and at 38 weeks. If a woman  develops obstetric complications, such as 
preterm labor or hypertensive disease  of pregnancy, which requires sonogra phic exami nation 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-16-0084  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  05/03/2016   she will have exams  by RDM S but based on intent-to-treat principle continue to be in the group 
she is randomized to. Clinicians managing the women  will be informed of the findings of the 
USE.  
 
The third trimester ultrasounds will follow the American  Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine 
(2007) guidelines. In particular, biparietal diameter (BPD) will be measured at the level  of 
thalami and insula, and measurement taken from outer edge of the proximal  skull to the inner 
edge of the distal skull. The head circumference (HC) will be measured at the same  level as the 
biparietal diameter,  around the outer perimeter of the calvaria.  Since HC is not affected by 
head shape, it will be used if the head is flattened (dolichocephaly) or rounded (brachycephaly). 
Abdominal circumference (AC) measurement will be determined at the skin line on a true 
transverse view  at the level of the junction of the umbilical  vein, portal sinus and the fetal 
stomac h.   Fem oral   length   (FL)   will   be   measured   with   the   beam   of   insonation   being 
perpe ndicular to  the  shaft,  excluding the  distal  femoral epiphysis (Chervenak 1998, ACOG 
2009).  Estimated  fetal  weight  will  be  derived  using  the  regression  equation  proposed  by 
Hadlock  (1985): Log10   (EFW)  =  1.5662 – 0.0108(HC) +  0.0034(HC)2  + 0.0468(AC )+0.171(FL)- 
0.003685(AC)(FL) with EFW  being estimated  fetal weight; HC, head circumference; AC, 
abdominal circumference, and; FL, femur length. If a fetal anomaly which  was not noted in early 
survey  is discover ed during the 3rd trimester USE,  clinicians and women be informed. 
 
Abnormali ties of fetal growth are fetal growth restriction (FGR)  and large for gestational age 
(LGA). A fetus will be considered to have FGR if the estimated fetal weight is < 10% for 
gestational age  and LGA if the estimate is > 90% for gestational age.  Amniotic fluid will be 
estimated  using single sonographic deepest pocket (SDP), which involves finding and vertically 
measuring the largest cord-free pocket of amn iotic fluid or will be calculated by the sum of the 
maxim um vertical pockets in all 4 quadrants.  Oligohydramnios, or decreased  amniotic volume, 
is a SDP less than 2 cm or am niotic fluid index < 5.0 cm; hydramnios, or excessive  amniotic fluid, 
is a SDP >8 cm or amniotic  fluid > 24.0 cm(ACOG 2009).

3.3 Patient Manageme nt 
 
Clinicia ns managing these women will be informed of the sonogra phic findings if any of the 
following is noted: 1) FGR or estimated fetal weight < 10% for gestational age, 2) LGA or 
estimated  fetal weight > 90% for gestational age, 3) oligohydramnios, 4)  hydramnios, or 5) 
sonogra phic findings which influences clinical management e.g.  spontaneous bradycardia or 
previously undetected fetal anomaly.  Wom en with abnormal findings will be notified. They will 
also  be  informed  that  their  clinicians  are  aware  and  management  will  be  according  to 
guidelines and departmental practices (Table 3).

3.4 Study Outcome  Mea sures and Ascertainments 
 
 
3.4.1    Primary outcome: 
 
The primary o utcome  is presence of SGA (EFW<10%), LGA (EFW> 10%), oligo hydramnios, or 
polyhydramnios among uncomplicated pregnancies that have indicated versus serial USE 
starting at 30 weeks or more. These parameters are not based on any outcomes  after birth. 
 
3.4.2 Secondary outcomes: 
 
 Com posite Neonatal Morbidity (CNM) among the two groups 
 Com posite Maternal Morbidity (CMM ) among the two groups. 
 
3.4.3 Statistical Analysis 
 
Intention to treat analyses will be performed. The rate of the primary outcome,  abnormal fetal 
condition (estimated fetal weight < 10% or > 90% for GA, oligo hydramnios or  polyhydramnios) , 
will be compared between the interventi on and control group using a log binomial  (or Poisson 
in case of nonconverg ence) model with treatment group as a covariate to estimate relative risk 
and 95% confidence interval  (CI). The definition of the primary outcome is presence of  FGR 
(EFW< 10%), LGA  (EFW> 90%), oligo hydramnios, or polyhydramnios and is not based  on any 
outcomes after birth. Therefore there is no issue  about false-positives or false-negatives.  
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-16-0084  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  05/03/2016   Each seco ndary outcome will be analyzed similarly.  Based  on the MFMU Network data that 
stated CNM occurs in 1.9% of women with uncomplicated pregnancies, we estimate that over 
29,000 women  need to be randomized to show one-third improvement in CNM  (power 90%) 
among  uncomplicated  women  that  have  routine  ultrasound  exams  vs.  those  that  have 
indicated ultrasound  exami nations. Hence our purpose for these outcomes  is to calculate 
unbiased es timates to provide information for the large  multicenter trial in MFMU Network. 
 
We will also conduct a Bayesian  analysis  of the primary outcome to calculate probability of 
treatment benefit or harm. We will use a neutral prior distribution for the interventi on effect 
that excludes implausible large  treatment  effects: Normal (0, SD=0.70) in the log RR scale (prior 
95% interval  for the RR of 0.23-4.35) (28) Point estimates  of treatment effect and 95% credible 
intervals  will be reported with posterior probabilities of benefit and/or harm.

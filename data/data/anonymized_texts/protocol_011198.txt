Background and Rationale:
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common kidney cancer and  constitutes about 3% of 
all malignant tumors in adults.1RCC is often first detected at an advanced stage, with 
25-30% of patients having metastatic disease at diagnosis.  Unt il 2005, interferon-alpha 
(IFN-α) and high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 therapies were the standards of care for patients 
with advanced RCC (aRCC), albeit with modest efficacy. Since the n, development and 
approval of multiple vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have significantly improv ed the outcomes of aRCC 
patients.  These agents include the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyros ine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib and sorafenib; the mTOR i nhibitors temsirolimus and 
everolimus; and the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab.  However, durable and 
complete responses in aRCC patients are uncommon; the majority of patients will eventually 
develop resistance, exhibit disease progression while on therap y, and succumb to death due 
to metastatic disease.  Response rates for previously treated a RCC patients are in the 
15-25% range, and median survival after diagnosis is under 1 year .1
There is a strong rationale for considering immunotherapy in aR CC patients.  Cytokine-based 
immunotherapy, especially high-dose IL-2, exhibited durable res ponses in some aRCC 
patients.  There are anecdotal reports of spontaneous remission s in aRCC patients with 
evidence of antigen-specific lymphocyte infiltration in tumor t issues.16These reports have 
generated considerable interest in immunotherapeutic approaches  in the treatment of aRCC 
patients, especially with advent of immune checkpoint inhibitor s such as anti-programmed 
cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (P D-L1) monoclonal 
antibodies in recent years.  Upregulation of PD-1 receptor on tu mor-infiltrati ng lymphocytes 
(TILs), and its ligand PD-L1 on tumors, are associated with more  aggressive disease and 
poor prognosis.17,18
Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that block the PD-1/PD-L1 interactio n are novel 
immunotherapeutic approaches for aRCC, which have shown single- agent efficacy in 
patients whose disease has progressed following VEGF pathway in hibitor therapy.19,20
Nivolumab, a high-affinity, fully human anti-PD-1 mAb has shown durable tumor responses 
with objective response rate (ORR) of about 20% and median prog ression-free survival 
(PFS) of about 16 weeks in heavily pretreated aRCC patients.21,22When nivolumab was 
combined with a VEGF TKI (sunitinib or pazopanib), it demonstra ted more pronounced 
anti-tumor response.  Amin et al reported the data from combina tions of sunitinib or 
pazopanib with nivolumab at the American Society of Clinical On cology (ASCO) 
2014 annual meeting.23The pazopanib plus nivolumab arm was discontinued due to safety  
issues; however, sunitinib (50 mg, 4 weeks on/2 weeks off) was suc cessfully combined with 
nivolumab 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W), and dose expansion was sub sequently completed 
in previously untreated aRCC patients.  ORR was 52% (17/33) for  nivolumab in combination 
with sunitinib, and 45% (9/20) for nivolumab in combination wit h pazopanib.  Median 
duration of response (DR) was 37.1 weeks (95% confidence interva l [CI]: 18.1-80.0+), and 
median PFS was 48.9 weeks (95% CI: 41.6-66.0) with sunitinib plus  nivolumab.  090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 13MPDL3280A, another human mAb that targets PD-L1, has shown ORR of 13% and stable 
disease (SD) ≥24 weeks in 32% of patients with previously treated RCC when adm inistered 
as a single agent.  Results from the combination of bevacizumab  15 mg/kg Q3W with 
MPDL3280A (20 mg/kg) were presented by McDermott et al at the Eu ropean Society for 
Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2014 annual meeting.24Data were limited, but in previously 
untreated aRCC patients, there were 4 of 10 (40%) patients who ha d partial responses (PRs).  
Five additional patients had a best response of SD, and almost all (9 out of 10) responding 
patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.  These data, although preliminary, 
demonstrate the benefit of combining an anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibo dy with an anti-VEGF 
pathway agent in aRCC patients.
The combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab, a fully human mon oclonal antibody to 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), showed acce ptable safety and 
encouraging antitumor activity in patients with metastatic RCC.   Patients were randomized to 
receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Arm N3 + I1) or niv olumab 
1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Arm N1 + I3) intravenously (IV) Q3W fo r 4 doses, then 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W until disease progression or unacceptab le toxicity.  Confirmed 
objective response (OR) was observed in 9/21 patients in Arm N3 +  I1 and in 11/23 patients 
in Arm N1 + I3.  The median PFS was 36.6 weeks and 38.3 weeks in A rm N3 + I1 and in 
Arm N1 + I3, respectively.25
Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a fully human mAb of the immunoglobul in (Ig) G1 isotype 
that specifically targets and blocks PD-L1.26Avelumab is the proposed International 
Nonproprietary Name (INN) for the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody  MSB0010718C. 
Avelumab is being developed jointly by Pfizer and Merck KGaA/EM D Serono, and is being 
studied in a wide variety of adult cancers, such as non-small c ell lung cancer, gastric cancer, 
Merkel cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, ur othelial cancer, and 
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, as a single agent or in combination with ch emotherapy, tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors, or other immune-modulating agents. 
As of 05 November 2015, more than 1400 patients have been treated  with avelumab.  The 
largest trial is study EMR100070-001, a Phase 1, open-label, mul tiple ascending-dose 
clinical study aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, p harmacokinetics (PK), biological 
activity, and clinical activity of avelumab in patients with me tastatic or locally advanced 
solid tumors.  Study EMR100070-001 consists of 2 parts, a dose-es calation phase and a 
dose-expansion phase, the latter performed in selected tumor in dications.  Avelumab is 
administered intravenously (IV) at the assigned dose level as a  1-hour infusion once every 
2 weeks (Q2W). 
In the Phase 1 study EMR 100070-001, 53 patients have been treate d with avelumab doses of 
1.0, 3.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg administered IV every 2 weeks (Q2W ) in the dose escalation 
phase.  In the subsequent dose expansion phase, 1300 patients in  the pooled malignancies 
with different tumor types have been treated at a dose of 10 mg/ kg Q2W. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Preliminary Safety Data of Avelumab as Monotherapy in aRCC
In the aRCC cohort of the Phase 1 study EMR 100070-001, 18 patient s with aRCC in the 
second-line and beyond treatment setting received avelumab IV Q 2W at the dose of 
10 mg/kg (see Section 1.2.2.1 ).9Current data indicate that the safety profile of the aRCC 
cohort is consistent with that of the overall population of stu dy EMR 100070-001.  Since 
December 2015, an additional cohort of approximately 30 patients  with aRCC in the first-line 
treatment setting has started enrollment within the EMR 100070-0 01 study.
Axitinib is an oral, potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFRs 1 , 2, and 3 approved 
multinationally for the treatment of aRCC after failure of one prior systemic therapy (actual 
indication varies according to region/country).10The antitumor activity of single-agent 
axitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID) in previously untreated patients  with clear cell aRCC was 
assessed against sorafenib in a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 t rial.  Although the study did 
not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in PFS, axitinib was associated with a 
longer median PFS (mPFS) time (mPFS of 10.1 months [95% CI: 7.2, 12.1] with axitinib vs. 
6.5 months [95% CI: 4.7, 8.3] with sorafenib, stratified hazard ratio (HR) 0.77 [95% CI: 
0.56, 1.05]).13The mPFS observed with axitinib in this study was similar to th ose 
demonstrated earlier in Phase 3 clinical trials of other approved  VEGFR TKIs in the first-line 
treatment of aRCC patients.  Toxicities in this clinical trial were generally tolerable and 
manageable, and similar to those observed in clinical trials wi th axitinib in pre-treated aRCC 
patients.13
The most common adverse events (>20% of patients) reported amon g 1445 cancer patients 
receiving single-agent axitinib (regardless of causality) inclu ded diarrhea, hypertension, 
decreased appetite, nausea, weight decreased, dysphonia, palmar  plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome, hypothyroidism, and proteinuria.  The most frequent G rade ≥3 adverse events 
were hypertension, fatigue, and diarrhea.11The risk of hepatotoxicity was low in patients 
with aRCC with axitinib, with an overall rate of Grade 3/4 alani ne aminotransferase (ALT) 
or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased <0.6% for each.27The incidence of 
hematological toxicity was also low for axitinib in this patien t population (eg, 
Grade 3/4 platelet count decreased and neutrophil count decreased  0.3% for each).27CCI

Page 15Based on the observations above, it is proposed that the additi on of the PD-L1 inhibitor 
avelumab to the VEGF pathway inhibitor axitinib may provide add itional clinical benefit 
compared to treatment with an anti-VEGFR TKI alone without unac ceptable toxicity in 
previously untreated aRCC patients leveraging their complementa ry mechanisms of action.  
The combination of avelumab with axitinib has not been previous ly studied in patients; 
therefore, there are currently no safety data from this combina tion.  There are no expected 
overlapping toxicities between avelumab and axitinib, except fo r fatigue, nausea/diarrhea, 
and hypothyroidism, which are usually low-grade events easily m anageable following the 
adverse event management guidelines implemented in the study pr otocol.  Additional safety 
concerns are not expected from combining avelumab with axitinib  given their distinct 
mechanisms of action and toxicity profiles.
Overall, the observed benefit-risk profile supports the further  investigation of avelumab in 
combination with axitinib in the patient population chosen for this study.
This clinical study, therefore, is designed to determine the re commended doses as well as the 
preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of this  combination regimen needed 
to support a subsequent randomized clinical trial of avelumab in  combination with axitinib 
versus VEGFR TKI in the first-line aRCC treatment setting.

Study Design:
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, saf ety, PK and pharmacodynamic 
study of avelumab in combination with axitinib in adult patient s with previously untreated 
aRCC.  This clinical study will be composed of a Dose Finding P hase and a Dose Expansion 
Phase. 
The Dose Finding Phase will estimate the MTD and RP2D in patien ts with aRCC with clear 
cell histology who did not receive prior systemic therapy for a dvanced disease, using the 
modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method.29Dose finding will follow an mTPI 
design, with up to 3 potential dose levels (DL) to be tested:
•(DL1) avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 5 mg BID.
•(DL-1A) avelumab 5 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 5 mg BID.
•(DL-1B) avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 3 mg BID.
DL-1A and DL-1B will be explored concurrently in a randomized f ashion only if the MTD is 
exceeded in DL1. 
To understand the extent of any effects of avelumab on axitinib  PK, a 7-day lead-in period 
with single-agent axitinib will be included prior to Cycle 1 in a ll patients in the Dose Finding 
Phase of the study.  Since avelumab has a half-life of 3-5 days,  it would not be feasible to run 
a lead-in with avelumab alone to study the PK of avelumab alone .  Therefore, the effect of 
axitinib on avelumab will be evaluated by comparing avelumab tr ough concentrations at 
steady state in the presence of axitinib with those reported fo r avelumab alone in prior 
studies. 
The Dose Finding Phase will lead to the identification of an Ex pansion Test Dose for 
avelumab in combination with axitinib in patients with aRCC who did not receive prior 
systemic therapy for their advanced disease.  The Expansion Tes t Dose will either be the 
MTD (ie, the highest dose of avelumab and axitinib associated w ith the occurrence of DLTs 
in <33% of patients) or the RP2D, ie, the highest tested dose t hat is declared safe and 
tolerable by the investigators and sponsor.  Once the Expansion  Test Dose is identified, the 
Dose Expansion Phase will be opened, and avelumab in combinatio n with axitinib will be 
evaluated in up to 20-40 patients with previously untreated aRCC .CCI

Page 18Based on the emerging PK data, and after completion of the dose -finding part of the study 
based on the mTPI method, it may be necessary to enroll up to a pproximately 8 additional 
patients to further assess the effect of avelumab on the PK of a xitinib.  These additional 
patients will undergo the same evaluations and procedures as th ose described in the Schedule 
of Activities table for the Dose Finding Phase of the study and will be treat ed concurrently 
with the initiation of the Dose Expansion Phase of the study.  With the exception of the 
mTPI-related assessments leading to determination of MTD, any o ther assessments or 
procedures described for the Dose Finding Phase will also apply  to these additional patients.
Throughout the course of the study, patient safety will be clos ely monitored by the sponsor's 
study team.  The number of patients to be enrolled in the Dose Finding Phase will depend on 
the observed safety profile, and the number of tested dose leve ls. 
All patients will be followed for survival until death, end of the study, or patient withdrawal 
of consent, whichever comes first, regardless of initiation of new anti-cancer therapy.  
Patients who do not return to the site should be contacted by te lephone every 3 months as an 
alternative.
Study Treatment:
Axitinib will be given orally (PO) twice daily (BID), with or w ithout food, on a continuous 
dosing schedule.  Avelumab will be given as a 1-hour IV infusio n Q2W.  All patients will 
continue treatment with study drugs until confirmed disease pro gression, patient refusal, 
patient lost to follow up, unacceptable toxicity, or the study is terminated by the sponsor, 
whichever comes first (see Section 6.4 ). 
Patients will be monitored closely for toxicity, and in the eve nt of significant toxicity, dosing 
of one or both drugs may be modified.  Specifically, avelumab d oses may be omitted or 
permanently discontinued, and axitinib doses may be delayed, re duced or permanently 
discontinued, as per Section 5.3.5 .  Based on the known safety profile of axitinib, blood 
pressure as well as thyroid function will be monitored througho ut the treatment period.  
Axitinib treatment may be adjusted by dosing interruption with or without dose reduction 
(Section 5.3.5.3 ).  Avelumab treatment modification for drug-related toxicities,  including 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and infusion-related adve rse events (AEs) is 
described in Section 5.3.5 .
In the Dose Finding Phase, intrapatient axitinib dose escalatio n is not permitted, except for 
patients treated at DL -1B.  In these patients, a fter the comple tion of the primary DLT 
observation period, intrapatient axitinib dose escalation may o ccur according to the criteria 
described in Section 5.3.5.1 .  In the Dose Expansion Phase, intrapatient axitinib dose 
escalation may occur if the intrapatient escalation criteria ar e met (see Section 5.3.5.1 ).
Patients who stop one of the two study drugs (avelumab or axiti nib) for reasons other than 
confirmed disease progression may continue on single-agent trea tment with the other drug 
until disease progression (RECIST v.1.1), patient refusal, pati ent lost to follow up, 
unacceptable toxicity, or the study is prematurely terminated b y the sponsor, whichever 
comes first.  Patients who are still deriving clinical benefit following continued treatment for 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 19more than 2 years will be provided an option for continued study  treatment (eg, a rollover 
study).
Patients who stop avelumab after initial clinical benefit while  on treatment and then 
experience radiologic disease progression thereafter will be el igible for re-treatment with 
avelumab at the discretion of the investigator and after discus sion with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor if 1) no cancer treatment was administered other than ax itinib since the last dose of 
avelumab, 2) the patient does not meet the safety withdrawal cri teria, and 3) the trial is still 
open.  Patients will resume avelumab therapy at the same dose a nd schedule applied at the 
time of discontinuation. 
Patients who develop disease progression on study treatment but  are otherwise continuing to 
derive clinical benefit from study treatment will be eligible t o continue with avelumab 
combined with axitinib, single-agent avelumab, or single-agent axitinib provided that the 
treating physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doi ng so is favorable.
Statistical Methods:
Dose finding will follow the mTPI method,29using doses of avelumab and axitinib.
The escalation/de-escalation rules will follow the mTPI method.  Briefly, the mTPI method 
relies upon a statistical probability algorithm, calculated usi ng all patients treated in prior and 
current cohorts at the same dose level) to determine when futur e cohorts should involve dose 
escalation, no change in dose, or dose de-escalation.
Rules for dose-finding, using the mTPI method, include the foll owing:
•The target enrollment cohort size is 3 patients.  However, patie nts may be enrolled in 
cohort sizes of 3-4 depending on the number of potential patient s identified at 
participating sites.  The patients treated at each dose level m ay initiate dosing 
simultaneously.  If the first 2 patients experience a DLT prior to enrollment of the 
third one, the dose level will be deemed intolerable and the do se level will be 
de-escalated.
•The next cohort may be enrolled when all patients at the curren t dose cohort have 
been evaluated for 4 weeks (ie, the first 2 treatment cycles), or  experience a DLT, 
whichever comes first.
•If a patient withdraws from study treatment before receiving at  least 75% of the 
planned first 2 cycles of axitinib or 2 infusions of avelumab for  reasons other than 
study drug-related toxicity, another patient will be enrolled t o replace that patient at 
the current dose level.
•The dose-finding component of the trial is completed when 6 DLT- evaluable patients 
have been treated at the highest dose associated with DLT rate <0.33.  It is estimated 
that approximately 15 DLT-evaluable patients will need to be enro lled to reach 
6 DLT-evaluable patients at the estimated MTD.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 20•The RP2D will be confirmed in the Dose Expansion Phase, taking into account the 
MTD determination from the Dose Finding Phase, and other factor s related to safety, 
efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) involving all available  data from test 
cohorts. 
Sample Size Determination
The sample size planned for the dose finding phase arises from logistic feasibility and is not 
entirely driven by statistical considerations.  Due to the dyna mic nature of the dose allocation 
procedure and unknown safety profile of the combination, the sa mple size of the interval 
design cannot be determined in advance.  It is expected that ap proximately 15 DLT-evaluable 
patients will be required for the dose finding phase. 
Up to approximately 40 patients will be included in the dose exp ansion phase of the study for 
each MTD dose level cohort expanded.  A sample size of 40 patient s will provide at least 
90% probability to observe at least 1 AE if the true incidence o f the AE in the population is 
≥6%. 
Dose-Finding Criteria
Dose finding will follow the mTPI design, using doses of avelum ab and axitinib as shown 
below. 
Dose Levels in the Dose Finding Phase
Dose Level Avelumab Axitinib
1 (Starting Dose Level) 10 mg/kg IV Q2W 5 mg oral BID
-1A 5 mg/kg IV Q2W 5 mg oral BID
-1B 10 mg/kg IV Q2W 3 mg oral BID
BID: twice daily; Q2W: every 2 weeks
Alternative doses, schedule(s), and PK time points may be recon sidered during the study 
based on the emerging safety and PK data.
Based on the emerging PK data and after the completion of the d ose-finding part of the study 
based on mTPI method, it may be necessary to enroll up to appro ximately 8 additional 
patients to further assess the effect of avelumab on the PK of axitinib.  These additional 
patients will undergo the same evaluations and procedures as th ose described in the Schedule 
of Activities for the Dose Finding Phase of the study and will be treated con currently with 
the initiation of the Dose Expansion Phase. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 258.Vital Signs: Vital signs to include: blood pressure, pulse rate.  Blood pres sure and pulse rate should be taken with the patient in the sea ted position after the 
patient has been sitting quietly for at least 5 minutes.  Two blood pressure and pulse rate readi ngs will be taken at least 1 hour apart at each clinic visit. 
After amendment #4 approval, required every 6 weeks.
9.Home Blood Pressure Monitoring : All patients will receive home blood pressure monitoring devi ces and blood pressure will be monitored at home.  
While on axitinib (as a single agent during the Lead-in PK perio d and in up to 8 patients enrolled for further PK assessment, or  when combined with 
avelumab), patients will monitor their blood pressure at least twice daily (before taking each dose of axitinib), and blood pr essure should be recorded in a 
patient diary.  Patients should be instructed to contact the si te immediately for guidance if their systolic blood pressure ri ses above 150 mm Hg, diastolic 
blood pressure rises above 100 mm Hg, or if they develop symptom s perceived to be related to elevated blood pressure (eg, heada che, visual disturbances), 
although a different blood pressure threshold for contacting th e site may be used according to the investigator’s clinical jud gment (see Section 5.3.5.2 ). 
10.Hematology, Blood Chemistry, and Coagulation: Required tests are listed in Table 8 .  May also be performed when clinically indicated.
11. Blood Chemistry: Full chemistry panel (required tests are listed in Table 8 ) is required as follows: at Screening, Day 1 of Lead-in PK Peri od (if not 
performed in prior 3 days), Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1 , Cycle 7 Day 1, then every 6 weeks thereafter.  Core chemistry pan el (required 
tests are listed in Table 8 ) is required as follows: on Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 2 Day 8, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1, Cycle 8 Day 1, then every 
2 weeks thereafter.  If full and core chemistry panels are sched uled at the same visit, only the full chemistry panel will be p erformed. After amendment #4 
approval, required every 6 weeks. Required tests are listed in Table 8 .-
12.Thyroid Function Tests: free T4 and TSH will be performed at Screening, Lead-in Day 1 (onl y if not performed in prior 3 days), Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 
7 Day 1, and Cycle 13 Day 1, and then Q12W thereafter.  Additional  tests should be performed when clinically indicated.  Hypothyr oidism should be 
treated per standard medical practice to maintain euthyroid sta te.  See Table 8 .
13.ACTH : ACTH tests will be performed at Screening, Cycle 6 Day 1, then Q 12W thereafter.  Additional tests should be performed when clin ically indicated.
See Table 8 .
14.Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum pregnanc y test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be 
performed at up to three occasions prior to starting combinatio n study treatment: once at the start of screening, once at Lead -in Day 1 immediately before 
axitinib administration, and at the Cycle 1 Day 1 visit immediate ly before the administration of avelumab in combination with ax itinib.  Additional 
pregnancy tests (serum or urine) will also be routinely repeate d at every treatment cycle during the active treatment period a nd additionally whenever one 
menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherw ise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertak en if requested by 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations (see Section 7.1.1 ). 
15. Urinalysis : Required at Screening, at Cycle 1 Day 1 and then at Day 1 of eve ry odd cycle and at the End of Treatment.  After amendment #4 a pproval, 
required every 12 weeks. If protein ≥2+ by semiquantitative met hod (eg, urine dipstick), protein will have to be quantified by  24-hour urine collection. To 
be performed as clinically indicated at other time points.  See  Table 8 . 
16.12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) : See Section 7.1.5 for details.  ECG measurements will be obtained at Screening, L ead-in Day 7, Cycle 1 Day 1, and 
Cycle 4 Day 1.  Clinically significant abnormal findings in baseli ne ECGs will be recorded as medical history.  At each time poin t, 3 consecutive 12-lead 
ECGs (triplicates) will be performed approximately 2 minutes apa rt to determine mean QTc (average of triplicates).  Triplicate ECGs at Lead-in Day 7 and 
Cycle 4 Day 1 will be collected pre-dose and at 2 hours post-axiti nib dosing.  Triplicate ECGs at Cycle 1 Day 1 will be prior to av elumab infusion and 
within 30 minutes post end of -infusion.  When coinciding with b lood samples draws for PK, ECG assessment should be performed p rior to blood sample 
collection, such that the blood sample is collected at the nomi nal time.  If patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic adver se event (AE; eg, syncope, 
dizziness, seizures, or stroke), triplicate ECGs should be obta ined at time of the event.  If the mean QTc is prolonged (>500 m sec), the ECGs should be 
re-evaluated by a qualified person at the institution for confi rmation and repeated as clinically indicated.  Additional tripl icate ECGs may be performed as 
clinically indicated.  090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 2617.Tumor Assessments: Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease s ites.  Imaging may include chest, abdomen, and pelvis computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; brai n CT or MRI scans (required at baseline and when suspected brai n metastasis) and bone 
scans or 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18FDG-PET, required at baseline then every 12 weeks only if bone m etastases are present 
at baseline).  Otherwise, bone imaging is required only if new bone metastasis are suspected and at the time of confirmation o f complete response for 
patients who have bone metastases.  See Section 7.6 .  The CT and MRI scans should be performed with contrast agent s unless contraindicated for medical 
reasons.  The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in the following tumor 
assessments.  Antitumor activity will be assessed through radio logical tumor assessments conducted at baseline, at 6 weeks after  the first dose of therapy (ie, 
Cycle 1 Day 1), then every 6 weeks up to 1 year from the first dos e of therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed diseas e progression regardless 
of initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.  Assessments w ill be performed according to calendar days, regardless of trea tment delays or interruptions.  
Further imaging assessments may be performed at any time if cli nically indicated (eg, suspected progressive disease [PD], symp tomatic deterioration, etc.).  
Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) must be confir med with repeat imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial  documentation of 
response.  If radiologic imaging shows PD, then tumor assessmen t should be repeated after at least 4 weeks to confirm PD unless  clinical deterioration 
occurs.  Assessment of response will be made using Response Eva luation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1  
.  See Section 7.6 for additional information.
18. Follow-up for Axitinib Dosing Compliance: Follow-up by telephone will be done to confirm patient understa nding and compliance with dosing 
instructions on Cycle 1 Day 5.  Axitinib dosing compliance will also be assessed following any dose modification.  If needed, p atients will be retrained.
19.Adverse Events: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criter ia for 
Advers Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. After amendment #4 approval, patients receiving axitinib single agent will visit the site ev ery 6 weeks.  Between site 
visits, AEs collection will be performed every 2 weeks by teleph one call (eg, nurse) in a standardized form, unless the patient  is visiting the site for other 
reasons.  For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active reportin g period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from  the time that the patient 
provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patie nt’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any st udy-related procedure and/or 
receiving study treatment, through and including 90 calendar day s after the last dose of study treatment.  SAEs occuring to a p atient after the active 
reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if  the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs  that the investigator 
believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being relate d to the study drug are to be reported to the sponsor. 
AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the Case Re port Form (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least 1 d ose of study treatment 
through and including 90 calendar days after the last dose of st udy treatment.  If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, t he AE reporting period for 
nonserious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting pe riod after the last dose of study 
drug, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
20.Concomitant Medications/Treatments : Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and up 
to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.  All concomit ant medications should be recorded in the CRF including support ive care drugs 
(eg, anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), the drugs used to tr eat adverse events or chronic diseases, and non-drug supportive  interventions 
(eg, transfusions). After amendment #4 approval, patients receiv ing axitinib single agent will visit the site every 6 weeks.  B etween site visits, concomitant 
medication collection will be performed every 2 weeks by teleph one call (eg, nurse) in a standardized form, unless the patient  is visiting the site for other 
reasons.
21.Enrollment: Patient number and dose level allocation will be operated by th e sponsor (see Section 5.1 ).  Required information: site and patient identifiers 
and demographic information.  Study treatment should begin with in 3 days after enrollment.  CCI090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 2722.Study Treatment: Axitinib will be given orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on a conti nuous schedule.  Avelumab will be given as a 1-hour intravenous  (IV) 
infusion every 2 weeks (see Section 5 ).  Patients who develop disease progression on study treatment  but who are otherwise continuing to derive clinical 
benefit from study treatment will be eligible to continue with single agent axitinib, avelumab, or avelumab combined with axit inib, provided that the 
treating physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doi ng so is favorable. 
23.Pharmacokinetics : Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the  Schedule for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Table.  Pharmacokinetic 
samples for avelumab will be collected from all patients in the  study.  Pharmacokinetic samples for axitinib will be collected  from all patients in the Dose 
Finding Phase and up to approximately 8 additional patients to f urther evaluate the effect of avelumab on the PK of axitinib.  Details are outlined in Section 
7.2.  
25.Mandatory Archival FFPE Tumor Tissue:  An archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tiss ue block from primary diagnosis specimen 
must be provided for all patients enrolled in the study and sub mitted to the Central Laboratory prior to enrollment.  
 
  Cytology samples 
(eg FFPE cell pellet from Fine Needle Aspiration biopsy) are no t acceptable.  See Section 6.1.1 and Section 7.4.1 .
26.Mandatory Recent FFPE Tumor Tissue Block: A baseline de novo tumor biopsy (biopsied tumor lesion should not be a RECIST targ et lesion) must be 
obtained for all patients enrolled in the study.   
 
  For baseline de novo biopsy, tumor tissue from 
cytologic sampling (eg, fine needle aspiration, including FFPE cell pellet material), is not adequate and should not be submit ted.  The de novo biopsy(ies) 
should be formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded as per routine ( see Study Manual), and the resulting FFPE tissue block(s) shoul d be submitted to the 
Central Laboratory.   See 
Section 6.1.1 and Section 7.4.1 .
27.Anti-Avelumab Antibodies (Anti-Drug Antibodies, ADAs) and Neutra lizing Antibodies (Nab): One blood sample (3.5 mL) for anti-avelumab 
antibodies will be collected pre-dose on Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8.  Subsequently, testing should be performed approximately eve ry 12 weeks until cycle 50.
All samples should be drawn within 2 hours before start of avelu mab infusion.  Also see the Schedule for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Table.  
Additional samples for anti-avelumab antibodies (and simultaneo us PK draws for measurement of avelumab) will be collected at t he Day 30 Follow-up visit 
after the end of avelumab treatment.  All the samples that are positive for ADA may also undergo characterization for Nab.  Se e Section 7.3 .

Page 309.ACTH : ACTH tests will be performed at End of Treatment/Withdrawal a nd at the 30, 60, and 90 days Follow-up visits.  Additional test s should be 
performed when clinically indicated.  See Table 8 .
10.Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test  (serum or urine) will be performed at the End of 
Treatment/Withdrawal visit and at the 30, 60, and 90 days Follow -up visits, and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is mi ssed or when potential 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests m ay also be undertaken if requested by Institutional Review Boar d (IRB)/(Ethics Committees 
(ECs) or if required by local regulations (see Section 7.1.1 ). 
11. Urinalysis : Required only at End of Treatment. To be performed as clinica lly indicated at other time points.  See Table 8 . 
12.12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) : See Section 7.1.5 for details.  ECG measurements will be obtained at End of Treat ment/Withdrawal.  Three 
consecutive 12-lead ECGs (triplicates) will be performed approx imately 2 minutes apart to determine mean QTc (average of tripli cates).  When coinciding 
with blood samples draws for PK, ECG assessment should be perfo rmed prior to blood sample collection, such that the blood samp le is collected at the 
nominal time.  If patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic a dverse event (AE; eg, syncope, dizziness, seizures, or stroke),  triplicate ECGs should be 
obtained at time of the event.  If the mean QTc is prolonged (> 500 msec), the ECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person  at the institution for 
confirmation and repeated as clinically indicated.  Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.  
13.Tumor Assessments: Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease s ites.  Imaging may include chest, abdomen, and pelvis computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; brai n CT or MRI scans (required at baseline and when suspected brai n metastasis) and bone 
scans or 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18FDG-PET, required at baseline then every 12 weeks only if bone m etastases are present 
at baseline).  Otherwise, bone imaging is required only if new bone metastasis are suspected and at the time of confirmation o f complete response for 
patients who have bone metastases.  See Section 7.6 .  The CT and MRI scans should be performed with contrast agent s unless contraindicated for medical 
reasons.  The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in t he following tumor 
assessments.  Antitumor activity will be assessed through radio logical tumor assessments conducted at baseline, at 6 weeks after  the first dose of therapy (ie, 
Cycle 1 Day 1), then every 6 weeks up to 1 year from the first dos e of therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disea se progression regardless 
of initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.  Assessments w ill be performed according to calendar days, regardless of trea tment delays or interruptions.  
Further imaging assessments may be performed at any time if cli nically indicated (eg, suspected progressive disease [PD], sympt omatic deterioration, etc.).  
Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) must be confir med with repeat imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial  documentation of 
response.  If radiologic imaging shows PD, then tumor assessmen t should be repeated after at least 4 weeks to confirm PD, unles s clinical deterioration 
occurs.  Assessment of response will be made using Response Eva luation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1  
).  See Section 7.6 for additional information.
14. Survival: All patients will be followed for survival and subsequent antic ancer therapies every 3 months (±14 days) until death, end of the study or patient 
withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.  For patients ref using to go back to the site a telephone contact is acceptable.CCI090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 3115.Adverse Events: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criter ia 
for Advers Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  For serious adverse eve nts (SAEs), the active reporting period to Pfizer or its design ated representative begins 
from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which  is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study,  ie, prior to undergoing any 
study-related procedure and/or receiving study treatment, throu gh and including 90 calendar days after the last administration of the study treatment.  SAEs 
occuring to a patient after the active reporting period has end ed should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator become s aware of them; at a minimum, 
all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasona ble possibility of being related to the study drug are to be re ported to the sponsor. 
AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the Case Re port Form (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least 1 d ose of study treatment 
through and including 90 calendar days after the last of study tr eatment.  If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for 
nonserious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting pe riod after the last dose of 
study drug, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
16.Concomitant Medications/Treatments : Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and 
up to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment. All concom itant medications should be recorded in the CRF including suppo rtive care drugs 
(eg, anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), the drugs used to t reat adverse events or chronic diseases, and non-drug supportiv e interventions 
(eg, transfusions). 
17.Pharmacokinetics : Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the  Schedule for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Table.  Pharmacokinetic 
samples for avelumab will be collected from all patients in the  study.  Pharmacokinetic samples for axitinib will be collected  from all patients in the Dose 
Finding Phase and up to approximately 8 additional patients to f urther evaluate the effect of avelumab on the PK of axitinib.  Details are outlined in 
Section 7.2 .  
19.De Novo FFPE Tumor Tissue Block: A de novo (ie, fresh biopsy) tumor sample should be collected at the time  of discontinuation of either drugs and at 
the End of Treatment/Withdrawal, unless clinically contraindica ted.  Tumor tissue from cytologic sampling (eg, fine needle asp iration, including FFPE cell 
pellet material), is not adequate and should not be submitted.  The de novo biopsy(ies) should be formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded as p er routine (see 
Study Manual),  (see Section 6.1.1 for details) should be submitted to the 
Central Laboratory.  See Section 6.1.1 and Section 7.4.1 .
20.Anti-Avelumab Antibodies (Anti-Drug Antibodies, ADAs) and Neutr alizing Antibodies (Nab): One blood sample (3.5 mL) for anti-avelumab 
antibodies (and simultaneous PK draws for measurement of avelum ab) will be collected at the Day 30 Follow-up visit after the en d of avelumab treatment.  
All the samples that are positive for ADA may also undergo char acterization for Nab.  Also see the Schedule for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection

Cycle 4 Day 1.  Clinically significant abnormal findings in baseli ne ECGs will be recorded as medical history.  At each time poin t, 3 consecutive 12-lead 
ECGs (triplicates) will be performed approximately 2 minutes apa rt to determine mean QTc (average of triplicates).  Triplicate ECGs at Cycle 4 Day 1 will 
be collected pre-dose and at 2 hours post-axitinib dosing.  Trip licate ECGs at Cycle 1 Day 1 will be prior to avelumab infusion a nd within 30 minutes post 
end of infusion.  When coinciding with blood samples draws for PK, ECG assessment should be performed prior to blood sample co llection, such that the 
blood sample is collected at the nominal time.  If patient expe riences a cardiac or neurologic adverse event (AE; eg, syncope,  dizziness, seizures, or stroke), 
triplicate ECGs should be obtained at time of the event.  If th e mean QTc is prolonged (>500 msec), the ECGs should be re-evalu ated by a qualified person 
at the institution for confirmation and repeated as clinically indicated.  Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clin ically indicated.

Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) must be confir med with repeat imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial  documentation of 
response.  If radiologic imaging shows PD, then tumor assessmen t should be repeated after at least 4 weeks to confirm PD, unles s clinical deterioration 
occurs.  Assessment of response will be made using Response Eva luation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1  
).  See Section 7.6 for additional information.
17. Follow-up for Axitinib Dosing Compliance: Follow-up by telephone will be done to confirm patient understa nding and compliance with dosing 
instructions on Cycle 1 Day 5.  Axitinib dosing compliance will also be assessed following any dose modification.  If needed, p atients will be retrained.
18.Adverse Events: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criter ia for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. After amendment #4 approval , patients receiving axitinib single agent will visit the site every 6 weeks.  Between 
site visits, AEs collection will be performed every 2 weeks by telephone call (eg, nurse) in a standardized form, unless the p atient is visiting the site for 
other reasons. For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active re porting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins  from the time that the patient 
provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patie nt’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any st udy-related procedure and/or 
receiving study treatment, through and including 90 calendar day s after the last administration of study treatment.  SAEs occur ing to a patient after the 
active reporting period has ended should be reported to the spo nsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, a ll SAEs that the investigator 
believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related  to the study drug are to be reported to the sponsor. 
AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the Case Re port Form (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least 1 d ose of study treatment
through and including 90 calendar days after the last of study tr eatment.  If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for nonserious 
AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of study drug,

Page 3910.Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test  (serum or urine) will be repeated at the End of 
Treatment/Withdrawal visit and at the 30, 60, and 90 day Follow- up visits, and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is mis sed or when potential 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests m ay also be undertaken if requested by Institutional Review Boar d (IRB)/Ethics Committees 
(ECs) or if required by local regulations (see Section 7.1.1 ).  
11. Urinalysis : Required only at End of Treatment.  To be performed as clinic ally indicated at other time points. See Table 8 . 
12.12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) : See Section 7.1.5 for details.  ECG measurements will be obtained at End of Treat ment/Withdrawal.  At each time 
point, 3 consecutive 12-lead ECGs (triplicates) will be performe d approximately 2 minutes apart to determine mean QTc (average o f triplicates).  When 
coinciding with blood samples draws for PK, ECG assessment shou ld be performed prior to blood sample collection, such that the  blood sample is collected 
at the nominal time.  If patient experiences a cardiac or neuro logic adverse event (AE; eg, syncope, dizziness, seizures, or s troke), triplicate ECGs should be 
obtained at time of the event.  If the mean QTc is prolonged (> 500 msec), the ECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the institution for 
confirmation and repeated as clinically indicated.  Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.  
13.Tumor Assessments: Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease s ites.  Imaging may include chest, abdomen, and pelvis computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; brai n CT or MRI scans (required at baseline and when suspected brai n metastasis) and bone 
scans or 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18FDG-PET, required at baseline then every 12 weeks only if bone m etastases are present 
at baseline).  Otherwise, bone imaging is required only if new bone metastasis are suspected and at the time of confirmation o f complete response for 
patients who have bone metastases.  See Section 7.6 .  The CT and MRI scans should be performed with contrast agent s unless contraindicated for medical 
reasons.  The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in the following tumor 
assessments.  Antitumor activity will be assessed through radio logical tumor assessments conducted at baseline, at 6 weeks after  the first dose of therapy (ie, 
Cycle 1 Day 1), then every 6 weeks up to 1 year from the first dos e of therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disea se progression regardless 
of initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.  Assessments w ill be performed according to calendar days, regardless of trea tment delays or interruptions.  
Further imaging assessments may be performed at any time if cli nically indicated (eg, suspected progressive disease [PD], symp tomatic deterioration, etc.).  
Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) must be confir med with repeat imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial  documentation of 
response.  If radiologic imaging shows PD, then tumor assessmen t should be repeated after at least 4 weeks to confirm PD, unles s clinical deterioration 
occurs.  Assessment of response will be made using Response Eva luation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1  
).  See Section 7.6 for additional information.
14. Survival: All patients will be followed for survival and subsequent antic ancer therapies every 3 months (±14 days) until death, end of the  study or patient 
withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.  For patients ref using to go back to the site a telephone contact is acceptable.
15.Adverse Events: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criter ia for 
Advers Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated  representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is o btained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any 
study-related procedure and/or receiving study treatment, throu gh and including 90 calendar days after the last dose of study t reatment.  SAEs occuring to a 
patient after the active reporting period has ended should be r eported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of the m; at a minimum, all SAEs that 
the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibilit y of being related to the study drug are to be reported to the s ponsor. 
AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the Case Re port Form (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least 1 d ose of study treatment 
through and including 90 calendar days after the last dose of st udy treatment.  If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, t he AE reporting period for 
nonserious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting pe riod after the last dose of study 
drug, irrespective of any intervening treatment.CCI090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 4016.Concomitant Medications/Treatments : Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and up 
to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.  All concomit ant medications should be recorded in the CRF including support ive care drugs 
(eg, anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), the drugs used to t reat adverse events or chronic diseases, and non-drug supportiv e interventions 
(eg, transfusions). 
17.Pharmacokinetics : Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the  Schedule for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Table.  Pharmacokinetic 
samples for avelumab will be collected from all patients in the  study.  Details are outlined in Section 7.2 .  
19.De Novo FFPE Tumor Tissue Block: A de novo (ie,, fresh biopsy) tumor sample should be collected at the tim e of discontinuation of either drugs and at 
the End of Treatment/Withdrawal, unless clinically contraindica ted.  Tumor tissue from cytologic sampling (eg, fine needle asp iration, including FFPE cell 
pellet material), is not adequate and should not be submitted.  The de novo biopsy(ies) should be formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded as p er routine (see 
Study Manual), and the resulting FFPE tissue block(s) or slides  if blocks cannot be provided (see Section 6.1.1 for details) should be submitted to the 
Central Laboratory.  See Section 6.1.1 and Section 7.4.1 .
20.Anti-Avelumab Antibodies (Anti-Drug Antibodies, ADAs) and Neutr alizing Antibodies (Nab):  One blood sample (3.5 mL) for anti-avelumab 
antibodies (and simultaneous PK draws for measurement of avelum ab) will be collected at the Day 30 Follow-up visit after the en d of avelumab treatment.  
All the samples that are positive for ADA may also undergo char acterization for Nab.  Also see the Schedule for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Table .

Page 491. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Mechanism of Action/Indication
Previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). 
The mechanisms of action of avelumab and axitinib are described  in Sections 1.2.2.1 and 
1.2.2.2 , respectively. 
1.2. Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Renal Cell Cancer
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common kidney cancer and  constitutes about 3% of 
all malignant tumors in adults.1RCC is often first detected at an advanced stage, with 
25-30% of patients having metastatic disease at diagnosis.
RCC arises from the renal epithelium, and 5 major subtypes are c urrently recognized.  
Approximately 70-80% of these are clear cell RCC tumors, while other less common cell 
types include papillary (Types I and II), chromophobe, collectin g duct, and unclassified 
RCC.2Four RCC predisposing genes have been identified – MET protooncogene, von 
Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene ( VHL ), fumarate hydratase tumor suppressor gene 
(FH), and Birt-Hogg-Dubé tumor suppressor gene ( BHD ).
Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have a >70% risk of dev eloping clear cell RCC.  
This hereditary form of RCC is caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor 
gene on chromosome 3p.  More than 90% of sporadic clear cell RC C involves somatic VHL
gene mutations or methylation.  VHL gene mutations lead to loss of function of the VHL 
protein, accumulation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor s (eg, HIF-1alpha and 
HIF-2 alpha) which translocate to the nucleus and increase transc ription of angiogenesis 
factors (such as vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and platelet-derived growth 
factor [PDGF]) which induce tumorigenesis.  Clear cell RCC is a  highly vascular tumor with 
high expression of VEGF, VEGF receptor (VEGFR), and PDGF recept or (PDGFR).3
About one-third of patients with clear cell RCC present with St age IV disease.  Systemic 
therapy is given to patients with advanced disease (relapsed or  Stage IV) that is not amenable 
to complete resection.  However, it is recommended that these p atients undergo a 
cytoreductive nephrectomy where possible, prior to beginning sy stemic therapy, as per 
treatment guidelines.4
There are 7 molecularly targeted agents approved in the United S tates (US) as systemic 
therapy for advanced RCC that is predominantly clear cell.  Fir st line systemic therapy is 
usually one of the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (sun itinib, pazopanib, or 
sorafenib), the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (give n in combination with 
interferon [IFN]-α) or the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  inhibitor, temsirolimus.  
These drugs are used sequentially as single agents in subsequen t lines of therapy for 
advanced clear cell RCC.4-7090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

1.2.2.1. Avelumab (MSB0010718C)
The first investigational product in the present clinical trial  is avelumab (MSB0010718C), a 
fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin (Ig ) G1 isotype.  
Avelumab is the proposed International Nonproprietary Name (INN)  for the 
anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MSB0010718C. 
Avelumab selectively binds to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and competitively blocks 
its interaction with programmed death protein-1 (PD-1).  Compare d with 
anti-PD-1 antibodies that target T-cells, avelumab targets tumor  cells, and therefore, is 
expected to have fewer side effects, including a lower risk of autoimmune-related safety 
issues, as blockade of PD-L1 leaves the programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2)/PD-1 pathway 
intact to promote peripheral self-tolerance.8For complete details of the in vitro and 
nonclinical studies, refer to the avelumab investigator’s broch ure.9
Avelumab is being developed jointly by Pfizer and Merck KGaA/EM D Serono, and is being 
studied in a wide variety of adult cancers, such as non-small c ell lung cancer, gastric cancer, 
Merkel cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, ur othelial cancer, and 
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, as a single agent or in combination with ch emotherapy, tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors, or other immune-modulating agents. 
As of 05 November 2015, more than 1400 patients have been treated  with avelumab.  The 
largest trial is study EMR100070-001, a Phase 1, open-label, mul tiple ascending-dose 
clinical study aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, p harmacokinetics (PK), biological 
activity, and clinical activity of avelumab in patients with me tastatic or locally advanced 
solid tumors.  Study EMR100070 001 consists of 2 parts, a dose-esc alation phase and a 
dose-expansion phase, the latter performed in selected tumor in dications.  Avelumab is 
administered intravenously (IV) at the assigned dose level as a  1-hour infusion once every 
2 weeks (Q2W). 
As of 05 November 2015, a total of 53 patients were treated in th e dose-escalation phase of 
Trial EMR10070-001, with 4, 13, 15, and 21 patients being treate d with avelumab of 1, 3, 10, 
and 20 mg/kg, respectively.  None of the patients treated with d oses up to 10 mg/kg 
experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the 10 mg/kg dos e of avelumab was thus 
considered a safe and well-tolerated dose for further investigat ion in the dose-expansion 
cohorts.  One DLT (a Grade 3 immune-related adverse event charact erized by increased 
creatine kinase, myositis, and myocarditis) was observed in 1 pa tient at the 20 mg/kg dose 
level.
As of 05 November 2015, 1300 patients have been enrolled in the t umor type specific 
expansion cohorts of study EMR 100070-001 and treated with the r ecommended dose of 
10 mg/kg avelumab Q2W.  A summary of the safety data for the poo led expansion cohort is 
provided here. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

1.2.2.2. Axitinib (INLYTA®®, AG-013736)
The other investigational product in the present clinical trial  is axitinib (INLYTA®, 
AG-013736), an oral, small molecule, TKI selective for VEGFRs 1,  2, and 3, approved 
multinationally for the treatment of advanced RCC (aRCC) after failure of one prior systemic
therapy (actual indication varies according to region/country).10
Axitinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibit or that binds to the 
unphosphorylated (non-activated) “DFG-out” conformation of the catalytic domain of a 
receptor tyrosine kinase.  In enzymatic assays, axitinib was fo und to be highly potent 
(Ki= 28 picomolar) against the kinase activity of juxtamembrane doma in containing human 
VEGFR 2 recombinant protein.11In additional kinase assays, axitinib showed potent and 
ATP-competitive inhibition of the VEGFRs 1, 2, and 3 and PDGFR- β, but not other closely CCI

Page 53related family kinases.  Receptor binding studies and cell-base d assays confirmed that 
axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFRs 1, 2, and  3.  Axitinib was shown to 
have antiangiogenic activity in a number of models including sp ontaneous pancreatic 
islet-cell tumors of RIP-TAG-2 transgenic mice model and demonst rated antitumor efficacy 
including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity in multiple t umor models implanted in 
athymic mice. 
The safety and efficacy of axitinib were evaluated in a randomi zed, open-label, multicenter 
Phase 3 study.  Patients with aRCC (99% clear cell) whose disease  had progressed on or after 
treatment with 1 prior systemic therapy, including sunitinib-, b evacizumab-, temsirolimus-, 
or cytokine-containing regimens were randomized to receive axit inib (N=361) or sorafenib 
(N=362).  There was a statistically significant advantage for a xitinib over sorafenib for the 
primary progression-free survival (PFS) endpoint, 6.7 months (95 % confidence interval 
[CI]: 6.3, 8.6) vs 4.7 months (95% CI: 4.6, 5.6), respectively (h azard ratio 0.665; 95% 
CI 0.544-0.812; one sided p <0.0001).  There was no statistically  significant difference 
between the treatment arms in the secondary overall survival (O S) endpoint, 20.1 months 
(95% CI: 16.7, 23.4) vs 19.2 months (95% CI: 17.5, 22.3) for axi tinib and sorafenib (hazard 
ratio 0.969, 95% CI 0.800-1.174; one sided p=0.3744), respective ly.  The objective response 
rate (ORR) was 19.4% (95% CI: 15.4, 23.9) for axitinib and 9.4%  (95% CI: 6.6, 12.9) for 
sorafenib.  The most common ( ≥20%) adverse reactions observed in this study following 
treatment with axitinib were diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, d ecreased appetite, nausea, 
dysphonia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot) syndro me, weight decreased, 
vomiting, asthenia, and constipation.12
In another randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial, treatment-naïve  clear cell RCC patients 
were randomized (2:1) to receive axitinib (N=192) or sorafenib (N=96).  There was no 
significant difference in median PFS between patients treated w ith axitinib or sorafenib, 
10.1 months (95% CI: 7.2, 12.1) vs 6.5 months (95% CI: 4.7, 8.3) as assessed by Independent 
Review Committee, respectively, with stratified hazard ratio 0. 77 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.05; one 
sided p=0.038).  The axitinib ORR assessed by an Independent Ra diology Review 
Committee was 32%, risk ratio 2.21, (95% CI: 1.31, 3.75, strati fied one-sided p=0.0006).  
Adverse events more common ( ≥10%) with axitinib versus sorafenib were diarrhoea, 
hypertension, weight decrease, decreased appetite, dysphonia, h ypothyroidism, and upper 
abdominal pain; those more common with sorafenib versus axitini b included palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthes ia (hand-foot) syndrome and rash, alopecia and e rythema.13Toxicities in 
this clinical trial were generally tolerable and manageable and similar to those observed in 
clinical trials of axitinib in pre-treated aRCC patients.13
Overall, the adverse events reported for axitinib in clinical s tudies were considered generally 
tolerable and manageable.  For single-agent axitinib, the most common adverse events 
(>20% of patients) reported from 1445 cancer patients regardless of causality included 
diarrhea, hypertension, decrease appetite, nausea, weight decre ased, dysphonia, 
palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, hypothyroidism, an d proteinuria.  
Grade≥3 events that occurred most frequently were hypertension, fatigu e, and diarrhea.11090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 54Following oral administration, axitinib is rapidly absorbed (me dian T max2.5-4.1 hours).  The 
plasma half life of axitinib ranges from 2.5 to 6.1 hours and ste ady-state is expected within 
2 to 3 days of dosing.  Dosing of axitinib at 5 mg twice daily res ulted in approximately 
1.4-fold accumulation compared to administration of a single do se.  At steady state, axitinib 
exhibits approximately linear PK within the 1-mg to 20-mg dose range.  The mean absolute 
bioavailability of axitinib after an oral 5 mg dose is 58%.  Axi tinib may be administered with 
or without food.  Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the live r by CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser 
extent by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1.  The predominant sulfoxi de and 
N-glucuronide metabolites in human plasma show approximately ≥4 00-fold less in vitro 
potency against VEGFR-2 compared to axitinib.

1.2.3. Rationale for Studying Avelumab in Combination with Axiti nib in Patients with 
Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
Tumor angiogenesis is a complex dynamic process necessary for th e continued growth of 
solid tumors.  VEGF is one of the most important angiogenic fac tors secreted by the tumor 
and other cells.  Its production is enhanced by several stimuli , including hypoxia.  VEGF and 
VEGFRs are critical components of the processes leading to the branching, extension, and 
survival of endothelial cells which form new blood vessels duri ng angiogenesis, and which is 
an absolute necessity for tumor growth beyond microscopic size.   Inhibitors of angiogenesis
are now widely used in the treatment of cancer, and most of the se agents inhibit the VEGF 
pathway.  VEGF pathway inhibitors include the VEGFR TKIs axitin ib, sunitinib, pazopanib, 
and sorafenib, and the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody bevacizuma b.  VEGF pathway 
inhibitors have been approved in a number of indications, inclu ding the treatment of 
aRCC.14,15
Until 2005, IFN- αand high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 therapies were the standards of care for 
patients with aRCC, albeit with modest efficacy.  Since then, d evelopment and approval of 
multiple VEGF pathway and mTOR inhibitors have significantly im proved the outcomes of 
aRCC patients.  These agents include the VEGFR TKIs sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib and 
sorafenib; the mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus; and  the anti-VEGF 
monoclonal antibody bevacizumab.  However, durable and complete  responses in aRCC 
patients are uncommon; the majority of patients will eventually  develop resistance, exhibit 
disease progression while on therapy, and succumb to death due to metastatic disease.  
Response rates for previously treated aRCC patients are in the 15-25% range, and median 
survival after diagnosis is under 1 year.1
There is a strong rationale for considering immunotherapy in aR CC patients.  Cytokine-based 
immunotherapy, especially high-dose IL-2, exhibited durable res ponses in some aRCC 
patients.  There are anecdotal reports of spontaneous remission s in aRCC patients with 
evidence of antigen-specific lymphocyte infiltration in tumor t issues.16These reports have 
generated considerable interest in immunotherapeutic approaches  in the treatment of aRCC 
patients, especially with advent of immune checkpoint inhibitor s such as anti-PD-1 and 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 55anti-PD-L1 antibodies in recent years.  Upregulation of PD-1 rece ptor on tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs), and its ligand PD-L1 on tumors, are associat ed with more aggressive 
disease and poor prognosis.17,18
Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that block the PD-1/PD-L1 interactio n are novel 
immunotherapeutic approaches for aRCC, which have shown single- agent efficacy in 
patients whose disease has progressed following VEGF pathway in hibitor therapy.19,20
Nivolumab, a high-affinity, fully human anti-PD-1 mAb has shown durable tumor response 
with ORR of about 20% and median PFS of about 16 weeks in heavil y pretreated aRCC 
patients.21,22When nivolumab was combined with a VEGF TKI (sunitinib or pazop anib), it 
demonstrated more pronounced anti-tumor response.  Amin et al r eported the data from 
combinations of sunitinib or pazopanib with nivolumab at the Am erican Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) 2014 annual meeting.23The pazopanib plus nivolumab arm was 
discontinued due to early safety issues; however, sunitinib (50 mg, 4 weeks on/2 weeks off) 
was successfully combined with nivolumab 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q 3W), and dose 
expansion was subsequently completed in previously untreated aR CC patients.  ORR was 
52% (17/33) for nivolumab in combination with sunitinib, and 45 % (9/20) for nivolumab in 
combination with pazopanib.  Median duration of response (DR) w as 37.1 weeks (95% CI: 
18.1-80.0+), and median PFS was 48.9 weeks (95% CI: 41.6-66.0) w ith sunitinib plus 
nivolumab.  MPDL3280A, another human mAb that targets PD-L1, ha s shown ORR of 13% 
and stable disease (SD) ≥24 weeks in 32% of patients with previously treated RCC when 
administered as a single agent.  Results from the combination o f bevacizumab 15 mg/kg 
Q3W with MPDL3280A (20 mg/kg) were presented by McDermott et al at the European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2014 annual meeting.24Data were limited, but in 
previously untreated aRCC patients, there were 4 of 10 (40%) pati ents who had partial 
responses (PRs).  Five additional patients had a best response of SD, and almost all (9 out of 
10) responding patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.  These data, although 
preliminary, demonstrate the benefit of combining an anti-PD-1 o r PD-L1 antibody with an 
anti-VEGF pathway agent in aRCC patients.
The combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab, a fully human mon oclonal antibody to 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4), showed acceptable safety and 
encouraging antitumor activity in patients with metastatic RCC.   Patients were randomized to 
receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Arm N3 + I1) or niv olumab 1 mg/kg 
+ ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Arm N1 + I3) IV Q3W for 4 doses, then nivolum ab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Confirmed objective response (OR) was 
observed in 9/21 patients in arm N3 + I1 and in 11/23 patients in A rm N1 + I3.  The median 
PFS was 36.6 weeks and 38.3 weeks in Arm N3 + I1 and in Arm N1 + I3,  respectively.25
Antitumor activity of single-agent axitinib 5 mg BID in previous ly untreated patients with 
clear cell aRCC was assessed against sorafenib in a randomized,  open-label, Phase 3 trial.  
Although the study did not demonstrate a statistically signific ant difference in PFS between 
patients treated with axitinib or sorafenib, axitinib was assoc iated with a longer median PFS 
time (mPFS of 10.1 months [95% CI: 7.2,12.1] with axitinib vs. 6 .5 months [95% CI: 4.7, 
8.3] with sorafenib, stratified hazard ratio 0.77 [95% CI: 0.56,  1.05]).  The mPFS observed 
with axitinib in this study was similar to those demonstrated e arlier in Phase 3 clinical trials 
of other approved VEGFR TKIs in the first-line treatment of aRC C patients.13Toxicities in 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mA b) of the 
IgG1 isotype that specifically targets and blocks PD-L1 (see Section 1.2.2.1 ).26Avelumab is 
the proposed International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for the an ti-PD-L1 monoclonal 
antibody MSB0010718C. 
As to the safety profile of avelumab see Section 1.2.2.1 .
Currently, the 10 mg/kg dose is the recommended Phase 2 dose for a velumab in single-agent 
studies.  In the dose escalation study of avelumab, the 10 mg/kg  dose was found to be 
well-tolerated and did not result in any DLT.  In addition, all  patients treated at this dose had 
a median trough concentration >1 μg/mL, the necessary concentration for >95% TO.  
Therefore, the lower 5 mg/kg dose is expected to be well-tolerat ed and based upon 
pharmacokinetic modeling and the dose-linear PK characteristics  of avelumab, median 
trough concentrations should achieve 95% TO in all patients. 
The risk of hepatotoxicity is low in aRCC patients on axitinib,  with an overall rate of 
Grade 3/4 ALT or AST increased <0.6% for each.27The incidence of hematological toxicity 
was also low for axitinib in this patient population (eg, Grade  3/4 platelet count decreased 
and neutrophil count decreased 0.3% for each).27
Preliminary Safety Data of Avelumab as Monotherapy in aRCC.
In the aRCC cohort of the Phase 1 study EMR 100070-001, 18 patien ts with aRCC in the 
second-line and beyond treatment setting received avelumab IV Q 2W at the dose of 
10 mg/kg (see Section 1.2.2.1 ).9Current data indicate that the safety profile of the aRCC 
cohort is consistent with that of the overall population of stu dy EMR 100070-001.  Since 
December 2015, an additional cohort of approximately 30 patients  with aRCC in the first-line 
treatment setting has started enrollment within the EMR 100070-0 01 study.
Safety Considerations for Avelumab in Combination with Axitinib
The combination of avelumab with axitinib has not been previous ly studied in patients; 
therefore, there are currently no safety data from this combina tion.  There are no expected 
overlapping toxicities between avelumab and axitinib, except fo r fatigue, nausea/diarrhea, 
and hypothyroidism, which are usually low-grade events easily m anageable following the 
adverse event management guidelines implemented in the study pr otocol.  Additional safety 
concerns are not expected from combining avelumab with axitinib  given their distinct 
mechanisms of action and toxicity profiles.
Overall, the observed benefit-risk profile supports the further  investigation of avelumab in 
combination with axitinib in the patient population chosen for this study.
It is proposed that the addition of the PD-L1 inhibitor, aveluma b, to the VEGF pathway 
inhibitor, axitinib, may provide additional clinical benefit co mpared to treatment with an 
anti-VEGFR TKI alone without unacceptable toxicity in untreated  aRCC patients leveraging 
their complementary mechanisms of action.  This study, therefor e, is designed to determine 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

combination regimen needed to support a subsequent randomized c linical trial of avelumab 
in combination with axitinib versus VEGFR TKI in the first-line  aRCC treatment setting.
1.2.4. Rationale for Avelumab and Axitinib Starting Doses
1.2.4.1. Axitinib Starting Dose and Regimen
In this clinical trial, the axitinib starting dose will be 5 mg administered orally (PO) twice 
daily (BID) with or without food.  This dose has proven to be s afe and efficacious in aRCC 
and has been approved by regulatory authorities worldwide.
1.2.4.2. Avelumab Starting Dose and Regimen
In this clinical trial, the avelumab starting dose will be 10 mg /kg administered as 1-hour 
intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks (Q2W).  This dose is the  recommended dose 
administered to a total of 480 patients in the ongoing dose-expa nsion phase of study EMR 
100070-001 (see Section 1.2.2.1 for details). 
1.3. Summary of Benefit Risk Assessment
An evaluation of the anticipated benefits and risks as required  in Article 3(2)(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC (cf. Article 6(3)(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC) has be en conducted.
Based on the nonclinical and Phase 1 clinical data available to d ate, the conduct of the trial 
with the proposed avelumab dose and regimen is considered justi fiable. 
As noted above ( Section 1.2.3 ), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by agents binding either 
PD-1 or PD-L1 (anti-PD-1 mAb or anti-PD-L1 mAb) is a novel immunoth erapeutic approach 
for aRCC, and anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents have shown single-a gent efficacy in patients 
whose disease has progressed following VEGF pathway inhibitor t herapy.  Furthermore, 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have shown to produce objective respo nse rates of 13% to 52% 
as single agents or in combination with a VEGF pathway inhibito r in patients with 
aRCC.19,20,23Recent studies suggested that TKI administration induces PD-L1 e xpression 
which might lead to immune tolerance and acquired resistance to  VEGF targeted agents such 
as axitinib.  Therefore, the addition of axitinib, which is a s tandard therapy for patients with 
RCC, might be synergistic with avelumab in treating patients wi th aRCC.
For single-agent avelumab, based on the nonclinical and Phase 1 trial EMR 
100070-001 clinical data available to date, the conduct of the t rial with the proposed 
avelumab dosing regimen is considered justifiable.  The clinica l safety data available to date, 
with single-agent avelumab in patients with advanced solid tumo rs, suggest an acceptable 
safety profile of the compound.  Most of the observed events we re either in line with those 
expected in patients with advanced solid tumors or with similar  class effects of monoclonal 
antibodies blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis.  Infusion-related react ions including 
hypersensitivity and irAEs/autoimmune disorders have been ident ified as important risks for 
avelumab.  Respective risk mitigation measures have been implem ented in all ongoing 
clinical studies with avelumab, including this clinical trial p rotocol.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 58Axitinib is approved multinationally for the treatment of aRCC after failure of one prior 
systemic therapy.  Furthermore, axitinib has been studied as fi rst-line aRCC treatment in a 
Phase 3 clinical trial, and in this treatment setting, the safet y profile is comparable to the one 
observed in the second-line treatment setting.12,13Overall, the adverse events reported for 
axitinib in clinical studies is considered generally tolerable and manageable, and are well 
characterized (see Section 1.2.2.2 ). 
The combination of avelumab with axitinib has not been previous ly studied in patients; 
therefore, there are currently no safety data for the combinati on.  There are no expected 
overlapping toxicities between avelumab and axitinib, except fo r fatigue, nausea/diarrhea, 
and hypothyroidism, which are usually low-grade events easily m anageable with 
symptomatic or steroid therapies and following the adverse even t management guidelines 
implemented in the study protocol.  Additional safety concerns are not expected from 
combining avelumab with axitinib given their distinct mechanism s of action and toxicity 
profiles.
These results, together with the acceptable safety profile of a velumab as currently 
demonstrated by the ongoing Phase 1 trial EMR100070-001, support  the hypothesis that 
avelumab in combination with axitinib may represent an importan t therapeutic approach in 
patients with aRCC.  Thus, the projected benefit/risk of avelum ab given in combination with 
axitinib is favorable for investigation in this advanced cancer  patient population.

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Study Overview
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, saf ety, PK and pharmacodynamic 
study of avelumab in combination with axitinib in adult patient s with previously untreated 
aRCC.  This clinical study will be composed of a Dose Finding P hase and a Dose Expansion 
Phase. 
The Dose Finding Phase will estimate the MTD and RP2D in patien ts with aRCC with clear 
cell histology who did not receive prior systemic therapy for a dvanced disease, using the 
modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method.29Dose finding will follow an mTPI 
design, with up to 3 potential dose levels (DL) to be tested:
•(DL1) avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 5 mg BID.
•(DL-1A) avelumab 5 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 5 mg BID.
•(DL-1B) avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 3 mg BID. 
DL-1A and DL-1B will be explored concurrently in a randomized f ashion only if the MTD is 
exceeded in DL1. 
To understand the extent of any effects of avelumab on axitinib  PK, a 7-day lead-in period 
with single-agent axitinib will be included prior to Cycle 1 in a ll patients in the Dose Finding 
Phase of the study.  Since avelumab has a half-life of 3-5 days,  it would not be feasible to run 
a lead-in with avelumab alone to study the PK of avelumab alone.   Therefore, the effect of 
axitinib on avelumab will be evaluated by comparing avelumab tr ough concentrations at 
steady state in the presence of axitinib with those reported fo r avelumab alone in prior 
studies. 
The Dose Finding Phase will lead to the identification of an Ex pansion Test Dose for 
avelumab in combination with axitinib in patients with aRCC who  did not receive prior 
systemic therapy for their advanced disease.  The Expansion Tes t Dose will either be the 
MTD (ie, the highest dose of avelumab and axitinib associated wi th the occurrence of DLTs 
in <33% of patients) or the RP2D, ie, the highest tested dose t hat is declared safe and 
tolerable by the investigators and sponsor.  Once the Expansion  Test Dose is identified, the CCICCI

Page 61Dose Expansion Phase will be opened, and avelumab in combinatio n with axitinib will be 
evaluated in up to approximately 40 patients with previously unt reated aRCC. 
Based on the emerging PK data and after the completion of the d ose-finding part of the study 
based on mTPI method, it may be necessary to enroll up to approx imately 8 additional 
patients to further assess the effect of avelumab on the PK of axitinib.  These additional 
patients will undergo the same evaluations and procedures as th ose described in the 
Schedule of Activities table for the Dose Finding Phase of the study and will be treat ed 
concurrently with the initiation of the Dose Expansion Phase of  the study.  With the 
exception of the mTPI-related assessments leading to determinat ion of MTD, any other 
assessments or procedures described for the Dose Finding Phase will also apply to these 
additional patients. 
Throughout the course of the study, patient safety will be clos ely monitored by the sponsor’s 
study team. The number of patients to be enrolled in the Dose F inding Phase will depend on 
the observed safety profile, and the number of tested dose leve ls.
All patients will be followed for survival until death, end of the study, or patient withdrawal 
of consent, whichever comes first, regardless of initiation of new anti-cancer therapy.  
Patients who do not return to the site should be contacted by t elephone every 3 months as an 
alternative.
Study Treatment : 
Axitinib will be given orally (PO) twice daily (BID), with or w ithout food, on a continuous 
dosing schedule.  Avelumab will be given as a 1-hour IV infusio n Q2W.  All patients will 
continue treatment with study drugs until confirmed disease pro gression, patient refusal, 
patient lost to follow up, unacceptable toxicity, or the study is terminated by the sponsor, 
whichever comes first (see Section 6.4 ). 
Patients will be monitored closely for toxicity, and in the eve nt of significant toxicity, dosing 
of one or both drugs may be modified.  Specifically, avelumab d oses may be omitted or 
permanently discontinued, and axitinib doses may be delayed, re duced, or permanently 
discontinued, as per Section 5.3.5 .  Based on the known safety profile of axitinib, blood 
pressure as well as thyroid function will be monitored througho ut the treatment period.  
Axitinib treatment may be adjusted by dosing interruption with or without dose reduction 
(Section 5.3.5.3 ).  Avelumab treatment modification for drug-related toxicities , including 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and infusion-related AEs is described in 
Section 5.3.5 .
In the Dose Finding Phase, intrapatient axitinib dose escalatio n is not permitted, except for 
patients treated at DL -1B.  In these patients , after the complet ion of the primary DLT 
observation period, intrapatient axitinib dose escalation may o ccur according to the criteria 
described in Section 5.3.5.1 .  In the Dose Expansion Phase, intrapatient axitinib dose 
escalation may occur if the intrapatient escalation criteria ar e met (see Section 5.3.5.1 ).090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 62Patients who stop one of the two study drugs (avelumab or axiti nib) for reasons other than 
confirmed disease progression may continue on single-agent trea tment with the other drug 
until disease progression (RECIST v.1.1), patient refusal, pati ent lost to follow up, 
unacceptable toxicity, or the study is prematurely terminated b y the sponsor, whichever 
comes first.  Patients who are still deriving clinical benefit following continued treatment for 
more than 2 years will be provided an option for continued study  treatment (eg, a rollover 
study). 
Patients who stop avelumab after initial clinical benefit while  on treatment and then 
experience radiologic disease progression thereafter will be el igible for re-treatment with 
avelumab at the discretion of the investigator and after discus sion with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor if 1) no cancer treatment was administered other than ax itinib since the last dose of 
avelumab, 2) the patient does not meet the safety withdrawal cri teria, and 3) the trial is still 
open.  Patients will resume avelumab therapy at the same dose a nd schedule applied at the 
time of discontinuation. 
Patients who develop disease progression on study treatment but  are otherwise continuing to 
derive clinical benefit from study treatment will be eligible t o continue with avelumab 
combined with axitinib, single-agent avelumab, or single-agent axitinib provided that the 
treating physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doi ng so is favorable.
Tumor Assessment : Anti-tumor activity will be assessed by radiological tumor as sessments 
and will be based on RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 2 ) for secondary endpoints  
Increasing clinical experience indicates that traditional respo nse criteria may not be sufficient 
to fully characterize activity in this new era of targeted ther apies and/or biologics.  This is 
particularly true for immunotherapeutic agents such as anti-CTL A-4 and 
anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies which exert their antitumor acti vity by augmenting 
activation and proliferation of T cells, thus leading to tumor infiltration by T cells and tumor 
regression rather than direct cytotoxic effects.30,31Clinical observations of patients with 
advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab, for example, suggest ed that conventional 
response assessment criteria such as RECIST and World Health Or ganization (WHO) criteria 
are not sufficient to fully characterize patterns of tumor resp onse to immunotherapy because 
tumors treated with immunotherapeutic agents may show additiona l response patterns that 
are not described in these conventional criteria.32Furthermore, the conventional tumor 
assessment criteria (RECIST and WHO criteria) have been reporte d as not capturing the 
existence of a subset of patients who have an OS similar to tho se who have experienced 
complete response (CR) or PR but were flagged as progressive di sease (PD) by WHO 
criteria.32On these grounds, a tumor assessment system has been developed that 
incorporates these delayed or flare-type responses into RECIST v1.1CCI

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 63Anti-tumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor  assessments conducted at 
baseline, 6 weeks after the first dose of therapy (Cycle 1 Day 1) , every 6 weeks up to 1 year 
after the first dose of therapy, and then every 12 weeks theraft er until documented disease 
progression regardless of initiation of subsequent anticancer t herapy.  In addition, 
radiological tumor assessments will also be conducted whenever disease progression is 
suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration).  CR and PR must be co nfirmed with repeat 
imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation o f response.  If radiologic 
imaging shows PD, tumor assessment should be repeated after at least 4 weeks to confirm 
PD, unless clinical deterioration occurs.  Details are provided  in Section 5.3.3.3 .
Brain Computerized Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imagin g (MRI) scans are 
required at baseline and when there is a suspected brain metast asis.  Bone scan (bone 
scintigraphy) or 18fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT (18FDG-PET/CT) 
are required at baseline, then every 12 weeks only if bone metas tases are present at baseline.  
Otherwise, bone imaging is required only if new bone mestastase s are suspected.  Bone 
imaging is also required at the time of confirmation of CR for patients who have bone 
metastases.
Safety Assessments : Safety will be monitored at regular intervals throughout the study by 
means of laboratory tests and clinical visits as reported in th e Schedule of Activities .
Pharmacokinetic/Immunogenicity Assessments : PK/immunogenicity sampling will be 
collected as described in the Schedule of Activities and in the Schedule for Pharmacokinetic 
Sample Collection .  To understand the PK effects of avelumab on axitinib, a 7-da y lead-in 
period with single-agent axitinib will be included prior to Cyc le 1 in all patients in the Dose 
Finding Phase of the study.  Based on the emerging PK profile o f avelumab, and after the 
dose-finding per mTPI method is complete, it may be necessary t o enroll up to approximately 
8 additional patients to further assess the effect of avelumab o n the PK of axitinib.  Since 
avelumab has a half-life of 3-5 days, it would not be feasible t o run a lead-in to study the PK 
of avelumab alone.  Therefore, the effect of axitinib on avelum ab will be evaluated by 
comparing avelumab trough concentrations at steady state in the  presence of axitinib with 
those reported for avelumab alone in prior studies. 
The proposed doses, schedule(s), and PK time points may be recon sidered and modified 
during the study based on emerging safety and PK data.
Biomarker Assessments : A key objective of the biomarker analyses that will be perfor med in 
this study is to investigate biomarkers that are potentially pr edictive of treatment benefit with 
the combination of avelumab and axitinib.  In addition, biomark er studies of tumor and blood 
biospecimens will be carried out to help further understand the  mechanism of action of the 
avelumab in combination with axitinib, as well as potential mec hanisms of resistance. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 65Dose de-escalation to DL-1A and DL-1B
Possible dose-finding scenarios based on the starting dose leve l (1) tolerability are illustrated 
in Table 2.  DL-1A and DL-1B will be explored only if the design  recommends de-escalation 
at DL1. 
In this dosing algorithm, there are up to 3 potential dose level s (DL): (DL1) avelumab 
10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 5 mg BID, (DL-1A) avelumab 5 mg/kg Q2W + ax itinib 5 mg BID, 
and (DL-1B) avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 3 mg BID. 
Alternative doses, schedule(s), and PK time points may be recon sidered during the study 
based on the emerging safety and PK data.
There are several potential dose-finding sequences for avelumab in combination with 
axitinib.  The specific sequence to be followed depends upon th e number of patients enrolled 
in the study and the number of DLTs observed at each specific do se combination.  The 
sequences are mutually exclusive, meaning only one of the seque nces will be followed 
throughout the course of the study.  Possible sequences are lis ted below in Table 2. 
Table 2. Possible Dose Finding Sequences
Possible Sequences Starting with Dose Level 1
a) DL1
b) DL1 →DL-1A and DL-1B
c) DL1 →DL-1A and DL-1B →DL1
DL: dose level
Dosing will begin at DL1 and possibly be de-escalated to DL-1A a nd DL-1B according to 
Table 1 and Table 2.
Dose escalation from DL-1 back to DL1 will be allowed as long as DL1 has not been 
determined to have exceeded the MTD and the rule indicates esca lation for both DL-1A and 
DL-1B.  The escalation/de-escalation rules will follow the mTPI  method.29
Briefly, the mTPI method relies upon a statistical probability algorithm, calculated using all 
patients treated in prior and current cohorts at the same dose level to determine where future 
cohorts should involve dose escalation, no change in dose, or d ose de-escalation.  The 
detailed dose-finding rules based on the mTPI are illustrated i n Table 3 .090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

U= The current dose is unacceptably toxic
Note: for the initial dose level (ie, “DL1”) evaluated, the dos es are maintained (“S”), while DL-1A or DL-1B 
may be escalated (“E”). 
As an example, if the total number of patients treated at DL1 is  3, the following dosing rules 
are applied:
•0-1D L T s  →remain at the same dose (DL1);
•2D L T s  →de-escalate to DL-1 and allow for possible escalation back to DL 1;
•3D L T s  →de-escalate to DL-1 and consider DL1 as intolerable.
If the dose is de-escalated to DL-1A and DL-1B and the total nu mber of patients then treated 
at DL-1A and DL-1B is 3, the following dosing rules are applied  within each dose level:
•0 DLTs (in DL-1A and DL-1B) →escalate back to DL1;
•1 DLT (in either DL-1A or DL-1B) →remain at the same DL (DL-1);
•2-3 DLTs (in either DL-1A or DL-1B) →de-escalation not possible and depending on 
the distribution of the DLTs one or both doses at DL-1 will be c onsidered intolerable.
Rules for dose-finding, using the mTPI method, include the foll owing:
•The target enrollment cohort size is 3 patients.  However, patie nts may be enrolled in 
cohort sizes of 3-4 depending on the number of potential patient s identified at 
participating sites.  The patients treated at each dose level m ay initiate dosing 
simultaneously.  If the first 2 patients experience a DLT prior to enrollment of the 
third one, the dose level will be deemed intolerable and the do se level will be 
de-escalated.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 67•The next cohort may be enrolled when all patients at the curren t dose cohort have 
been evaluated for 4 weeks (ie, the first 2 treatment cycles), or  experience a DLT, 
whichever comes first.
•If a patient withdraws from study treatment before receiving at  least 75% of the 
planned first 2 cycles of axitinib or 2 infusions of avelumab for  reasons other than 
study drug-related toxicity, another patient will be enrolled t o replace that patient at 
the current dose level.
•The dose-finding component of the trial is completed when 6 DLT- evaluable patients 
have been treated at the highest dose associated with DLT rate <0.33.  It is estimated 
that approximately 15 DLT-evaluable patients will need to be enro lled to reach 
6 DLT-evaluable patients at the estimated MTD.
•The RP2D will be confirmed in the Dose Expansion Phase, taking into account the 
MTD determination from the Dose Finding Phase, and other factor s related to safety, 
efficacy, PK, and PD involving all available data from test coh orts.
3.1.2. Dose-Limiting Toxicity Definition
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE ve rsion 
4.03 (see Appendix 4 ).  For the purpose of dose finding, any of the following adver se events 
occurring during the primary DLT observation period (4 weeks, fr om the time of first 
administration of avelumab [Cycle 1 Day 1] until the planned admin istration of the third dose 
of avelumab [Cycle 3 Day 1]) that are attributable to one, the othe r, or both agents in 
combination will be classified as DLTs:
•Hematologic:
•Grade 4 anemia; 
•Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days;
•Febrile neutropenia, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  <1000/mm3with 
a single temperature of >38.3 degrees C (>101 degrees F) or a sus tained 
temperature of ≥38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more than 1 hour; 
•Grade≥3 neutropenic infection;
•Grade≥3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding;
•Grade 4 thrombocytopenia.
•Non-Hematologic (including Non-Laboratory):
•Any Grade ≥3 toxicity, except for any of the following:090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

•Grade 3 hypertension controlled by medical therapy;
•Grade 3 diarrhea or Grade 3 skin toxicity that resolves to Grade ≤1 in less 
than 7 days after medical management (eg, immunosuppressant trea tment) has
been initiated;
•Any Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis;
•Tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or ra sh localized at 
sites of known or suspected tumor.
•Grade 3-4 liver function test elevation (alanine aminotransferas e [ALT], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST]) concurrent with Grade 2 elevation of tot al bilirubin.
•Non-hematologic Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormality if medical intervention is 
required to treat the patient, or if the abnormality leads to ho spitalization. 
•Single laboratory values out of normal range that are unlikely related to trial 
treatment according to the investigator, do not have any clinic al correlate, and 
resolve to Grade ≤1 within 7 days with adequate medical management are not
to be considered DLTs.
•Inability to complete at least 75% of the first 2 cycles doses o f axitinib (starting from 
Cycle 1 Day 1 after completion of the Lead-in PK period) or 2 infu sions ofavelumab 
within the DLT observation period due to investigational produc t-related toxicity.
In absence of associated clinical abnormalities, abnormal labor atory tests should be repeated 
to confirm relevance.  While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in  the context of dose 
finding/dose expansion phases are specified above, an AE not li sted above, or an AE meeting 
the DLT criteria above but occurring outside of the DLT observa tion period may be defined 
as a DLT after consultation between sponsor and investigator, b ased on the emerging safety
profile.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

The MTD estimate is the highest dose level tested of avelumab a nd axitinib associated with 
the occurrence of DLTs within the first 2 cycles of treatment in  <33% of DLT-evaluable 
patients.
3.3. Dose Expansion Phase Test Dose Definition
The Expansion Phase Test Dose will be the MTD identified in the  Dose Finding Phase.  
Further experience in the Dose Expansion Phase cohort may resul t in the need to explore a 
lower Dose Expansion Phase Test Dose.
3.3.1. Dose Expansion Phase 
The Dose Expansion Phase Test Dose identified in the Dose Findin g Phase will be expanded 
up to an additional 40 patients with the purpose of confirming t he safety, efficacy, PK, and 
PD of that dose.
In case both DL-1A and DL-1B regimens are identified as Dose Exp ansion Phase Test 
Doses, both of them will be expanded up to an additional 40 pati ents randomly enrolled in 
each arm.
3.4. Recommended Phase 2 Dose Definition
The RP2D is the dose of avelumab and axitinib in combination ch osen for further studies 
based on Phase 1 study results.  If the MTD proves to be clinical ly feasible for long-term 
administration in a reasonable number of patients, then this do se usually becomes the RP2D.  
Further experience with the MTD may result in a RP2D dose lower  than the MTD.  Attention 
will be given to the percentage of patients that discontinue tr eatment due to treatment-related 
AEs, especially (both early and late occurring) immune-related (dose-limiting) toxicities.

4.3. Life Style Guidelines 
4.3.1. Contraception
In this study, patients will receive avelumab (for which the te ratogenic risk is currently 
unknown) in combination with axitinib, which has been associate d with teratogenic risk.
The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with t he patient, will confirm that the 
patient has selected an appropriate method of contraception for  the individual patient or her 
partner from the permitted list of contraception methods (see Section 4.3.1.4 ) and will 
confirm that the patient has been instructed in its consistent and correct use.  At time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) , the investigator or designee will inform the 
patient of the need to use highly effective contraception consi stently and correctly and 
document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the patient’s chart 
(participants need to affirm their consistent and correct use of  at least 1 of the selected 
methods of contraception).  
Patients must agree to use at least 1 of the selected methods o f contraception throughout the 
study and continue to do so for at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the pati ent to call immediately if the 
selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy i s known or suspected in the 
participant or partner.
4.3.1.1. Male Participant Contraception
Male patients with female partner of childbearing potential mus t agree to use a male condom 
during the intervention period and for at least 30 days after the  last dose of study treatment.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 754.3.1.2. Female Participant Reproductive Status
A female patient is eligible to participate if she is not pregn ant or breastfeeding and at least 
1 of the following conditions applies:
•Is not a Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) (see definitio ns in Section 
4.3.1.3 ).
OR
•Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effe ctive (with a failure 
rate of <1% per year), preferably with low user dependency, as described below 
during the intervention period and for at least 30 days after th e last dose of study 
treatment.  The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive 
method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.
The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent 
sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman w ith an early undetected 
pregnancy. 
4.3.1.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athle tes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, addit ional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
•Documented hysterectomy;
•Documented bilateral salpingectomy;
•Documented bilateral oophorectomy.
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), invest igator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come fr om the site personnel’s 
review of the participant’s medical records, medical examinatio n, or medical history 
interview.  The method of documentation should be recorded in t he participant’s medical 
record for the study.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 762. Postmenopausal female:
•A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 years or older or n o menses for 
12 months without an alternative medical cause. 
•A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmeno pausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not usin g hormonal 
contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 
•Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contracept ion methods 
if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise , they must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study 
enrollment.
4.3.1.4. Contraception Methods
Highly Effective Methods That Have Low User Dependency 
1. Implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated  with inhibition of 
ovulation.
2. Intrauterine device (IUD).3. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).4. Bilateral tubal occlusion.5. Vasectomized partner.
•Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method  provided that the 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence  of sperm has 
been confirmed.  If not, an additional highly effective method o f contraception 
should be used.  The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Dependent 
1. Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contr aception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:
•oral;
•intravaginal;
•transdermal;
•injectable.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

3. Sexual abstinence:
•Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire peri od of risk associated 
with the study intervention.  The reliability of sexual abstine nce needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the pref erred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.
If exposure during pregnancy will occur, please refer to Section 8.10 Exposure During 
Pregnancy.
4.4. Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualifi ed medical personnel for the 
study is documented in the study contact list located in the Inv estigator site file.
To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personn el on study-related medical 
questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact car d.  The contact card contains, 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers , patient study numbers, 
contact information for the investigational site, and contact d etails for a contact center in the 
event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical 
question or problem originating from another healthcare profess ional not involved in the 
patients participation in the study.  The contact number can al so be used by investigational 
staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or proble ms, however it should be used 
only in the event that the established communication pathways b etween the investigational
site and the study team are not available.  It is therefore int ended to augment, but not replace 
the established communication pathways between the investigatio nal site and study team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during t he study.  The contact 
number is not intended for use by the patient directly, and if a patient call s that number, he or 
she will be directed back to the investigational site.
5. STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study, and per International Conferenc e on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutic al form of an active ingredient 
or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical tr ial, including a product with a 
marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or p ackaged) in a way different 
from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indicati on, or when used to gain 
further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).  For th e purpose of this study the 
investigational products are avelumab (MSB0010718C) and axitini b (AG-013736).090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 785.1. Allocation to Treatment
Dose level allocation will be performed by the sponsor after pa tients have given their written 
informed consent and have completed the necessary baseline asse ssments.  In case DL-1A 
and DL-1B both are investigated, 6 patients will be randomly ass igned to either dose levels 
(1:1 treatment allocation, 3 patients per dose level). 
The site staff will fax or e-mail a complete Registration Form to the designated sponsor study 
team member(s) requesting approval for patient enrollment.
After review of patient’s eligibility and concomitant medicatio ns, the sponsor will approve 
patient’s enrollment, if appropriate, and assign a patient iden tification number (8 digits, of 
which 4 belong to the site identifier number), which will be use d on all Case Report Form 
(CRF) pages and other trial-related documentation or correspond ence referencing that 
patient.  Demographic information will also be required.
The sponsor will fax or e-mail the approved Registration Form r eporting the patient 
identification number to the site.  See also Schedule of Activities table.
No patient shall receive investigational product until the inve stigator or designee has received 
the following information in writing from the sponsor:
•Confirmation of the patient’s enrollment.
•Specification of the dose level for that patient.
•Permission to proceed with dosing the patient.
The sponsor or designee will notify the other sites of the incl usion of a new patient, and will 
inform study sites about the next possible enrollment date.  St udy treatment (either 
single-agent axitinib for patients in Lead in or avelumab in co mbination with axitinib for all 
other patients) should begin within 3 days after enrollment or r andomization.  See Schedule 
of Activities table.
5.2. Patient Compliance
A patient diary will be provided to the patients to aid in axit inib compliance.  The diary will 
be maintained by the patient to include missed or changed axiti nib doses.
Patients will be required to return all bottles of axitinib at each clinic visit.  The number of 
axitinib tablets remaining will be documented and recorded at e ach clinic visit.  The patient 
diary may also be used to support this part of the axitinib acc ountability process.
The site is to follow up (for example, via a telephone call) wit h each patient at 
Cycle 1 Day 5 ( ±3 days) to confirm that the patient understands and is in compli ance with 
axitinib dosing instructions.  If needed, the patient will be r e-trained.  The same follow-up 
process will be applied in case the dose of axitinib is modifie d during the treatment period.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

appropriately qualified and experienced member of the study sta ff (eg, physician, nurse, 
physician’s assistant, practitioner, or pharmacist) as allowed by local, state, and institutional 
guidance.
5.3.2.2. Axitinib
Axitinib will be dispensed in opaque plastic bottles to protect  the compounds from light.  
Axitinib is a hazardous drug (due to possible reproductive toxi city), and should be handled 
according to the recommended procedures described in the curren t edition of the American 
Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP), Technical Assistance Bu lletin on Handling 
Cytotoxic and Hazardous Drugs, American Hospital Formulary Serv ice (AHFS) Drug 
Information (1999) and its references.  Procedures described in  each institution’s pharmacy 
or hospital standard operating procedure manual should be follo wed when handling 
hazardous drugs.
Axitinib will be provided in quantities appropriate for the stu dy visit schedule.  A qualified 
staff member will provide the study treatment via a unique cont ainer number using the 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system. 
Axitinib will be dispensed every 6 weeks or as otherwise indicate d.  Patients should be 
instructed to keep their study treatment in the bottles provide d and not transfer it to any other 
container.  In the event of dose modification, a request should  be made of the patient to 
return all previously dispensed study treatment to the clinic.
Axitinib must not be used for any purpose other than the trial.   The administration of trial 
investigational product to patients who have not been enrolled into the trial is not covered by

Page 815.3.3.1. Avelumab
The DAI within the IP Manual contains specific instructions for  avelumab dose calculation, 
reconstitution, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administ ration.
Avelumab will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all pr ocedures/assessments have 
been completed as described in the Schedule of Activities table.  Avelumab may be 
administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of e ach cycle.
Avelumab will be administered as a 1-hour IV infusion once ever y 2-weeks.  In order to 
mitigate infusion-related reactions, a premedication with an an tihistamine and with 
paracetamol (acetaminophen) approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to each dose of avelumab 
is mandatory (for example, 25-50 mg diphenhydramine and 500-650 mg  paracetamol 
[acetaminophen] IV or oral equivalent).  This may be modified b ased on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate.  Sites should make ev ery effort to target infusion 
timing to be as close to 1 hour as possible.  However, given the  variability of infusion pumps 
from site to site, time windows of -10 minutes and +20 minutes is  permitted (ie, infusion 
time is 60 minutes: -10 min/+20 min).  The exact duration of infus ion should be recorded in 
both source documents and CRFs.  Possible modifications of the infusion rate for the 
management of infusion-related reactions are described in Section 5.3.5.5 . 
The dose amount required to prepare the avelumab infusion solut ion will be based on the 
patient’s weight in kilograms (kg).  All patients should be wei ghed within 3 days prior to 
dosing for every cycle.  If the patient experienced either a we ight loss or gain 
>10% compared to the weight used to calculate the prior dose, th e amount of study drug 
required for preparation and administration for the current cyc le must be recalculated using 
this most recent weight obtained. For weight changes ≤10% compa red to the weight used to 
calculate the prior dose, the decision on whether to recalculat e the avelumab dose will be 
made in accordance with local practices. Avelumab dose reduction  for toxicity management 
is not permitted, however next cycle administration may be omit ted due to persisting toxicity 
as described in Table 5 and Section 5.3.5 .
5.3.3.2. Axitinib
Axitinib will be administered orally BID at approximately the s ame time in the morning and 
evening on a continuous dosing schedule, ie, without a break in  dosing in the absence of 
drug-related toxicity (see Section 5.3.5 ).  Axitinib tablets are to be taken approximately 
12 hours apart and may be administered without regard to meals.  Tablets must not be 
crushed, split, or dissolved, and patients should be instructed  to swallow the study medication 
whole without manipulation or chewing of the medication prior t o swallowing. 
A dosing card will be provided to the patients to provide guida nce for the correct use of 
axitinib. 
Patients must be instructed that if they miss a dose or vomit a nytime after taking a dose, they 
must not “make it up” with an extra dose, but instead resume su bsequent doses as prescribed.  
Any missed dose may be taken late, up to 3 hours before the next  scheduled dose of that day, 
otherwise, it should be skipped and dosing resumed with subsequ ent doses as prescribed.  090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 82Patient must be instructed to record all doses (missed or vomit ed doses or extra doses) in a 
dosing diary supplied by the site.  If doses are missed or vomi ted or if an extra dose is taken, 
this must be indicated in the source documents and CRFs.
If a patient inadvertently takes 1 extra dose during a day, the patient should not take the next 
dose.
5.3.3.3. Treatment after Initial Evidence of Radiologic Disease Progression 
Immunotherapeutic agents such as avelumab may produce antitumor effects by potentiating 
endogenous cancer-specific immune responses.  The response patt erns seen with such an 
approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses  seen with cytotoxic agents, 
and can manifest as a clinical response after an initial increa se in tumor burden or even the 
appearance of new lesions. 
If radiologic imaging shows disease progression, tumor assessme nt should be repeated 
≥4 weeks later in order to confirm the observation, unless clinic al deterioration occurs.  
Assigned study treatment may be continued at the investigator’s  discretion while awaiting 
radiologic confirmation of disease progression. 
Patients may receive study treatment while waiting for confirma tion of PD if they are 
clinically stable as defined by the following criteria: 
•Absence of clinical signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) 
of disease progression. 
•No decline in ECOG performance status. 
•Absence of rapid progression of disease by radiographic imaging . 
•Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, c ord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.
If repeat imaging no longer shows PD but rather CR, PR or SD co mpared to the initial scan, 
treatment may be continued/resumed.  In determining whether or not the tumor burden has 
increased or decreased, investigators should consider all targe t as well as non target lesions. 
If the repeat imaging confirms PD, patients should be discontin ued from study treatment.  
However, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment and after discussion between the 
investigator and the sponsor, if a patient with evidence of PD is still experiencing clinical 
benefit, the patient may be eligible for continued treatment wi th single agent avelumab, 
axitinib, or avelumab combined with axitinib.  The investigator ’s judgment should be based 
on the overall benefit-risk assessment and the patient’s clinic al condition, including 
performance status, clinical symptoms, adverse events and labor atory data. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 83Patients who stop avelumab after initial clinical benefit while  on treatment and then 
experience radiologic disease progression thereafter will be el igible for re-treatment with 
avelumab at the discretion of the investigator and after discus sion with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor if 1) no cancer treatment was administered other than ax itinib since the last dose of 
avelumab, 2) the patient does not meet the safety withdrawal cri teria, and 3) the trial is still 
open.  Patients will resume avelumab therapy at the same dose a nd schedule applied at the 
time of discontinuation.
5.3.4. Food Requirements
Both investigational products may be administered without regar d for food, but patients must 
avoid foods that are known strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (eg, grape fruit juice or 
grapefruit/grapefruit-related citrus fruits [eg, Seville orange s, pomelos]).
5.3.5. Recommended Dose Modifications
Every effort should be made to administer investigational produ ct on the planned dose and 
schedule.
In the event of significant toxicity, dosing may be delayed and /or reduced as described 
below.  In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst 
toxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify inv estigators at the first occurrence 
of any adverse symptom.  In addition to dose modifications, inv estigators are encouraged to 
employ best supportive care according to local institutional cl inical practices and according 
to the guidance for selected adverse events provided below.
For axitinib dose modifications may occur in 2 ways:
•Within a cycle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and  dose reduction, if 
required, during a given treatment cycle;
•In the next cycle: dose reduction may be required in a subseque nt cycle based on 
toxicity experienced in the previous cycle.
For avelumab, no dose modifications are permitted in this study , but next infusion may be 
omitted based on persisting toxicity, as outlined in Table 5 . 
Dose modifications and infusion omissions may occur independent ly for the two drugs used 
in this study and will be reported in the CRF.
Available axitinib dose levels for intrapatient dose modificati on are listed in Table 4 .
5.3.5.1. Intrapatient Axitinib Dose Escalation and Dose Reductio n 
In the Dose Finding Phase, intrapatient axitinib dose escalatio n is not permitted for patients 
treated at DL-1A.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 84Intrapatient axitinib dose escalation is permitted for patients  treated in the Dose Finding 
Phase at DL-1B (avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 3 mg BID).  In th ese patients, after the 
completion of the primary DLT observation period (4 weeks), intr apatient axitinib dose 
escalation to 5 mg BID may occur according to the criteria repor ted below. 
In the Dose Expansion Phase, intrapatient axitinib dose escalati on up to 10 mg BID may 
occur according to the criteria reported below. 
Criteria for Intrapatient Dose Escalation: Patients who tolerate the current axitinib dose 
without Grade >2 drug-related adverse events for 2 consecutive weeks (in the Dos e 
Expansion Phase) or 4 consecutive weeks (in the Dose Finding Pha se, only DL-1B), and who 
do not experience BP >150/90 mm Hg or concurrent administration of antihypertensive 
medication, have the option to have their axitinib dose increas ed (by one dose level at a time 
[Table 4]).  Patients treated in the Dose Finding Phase at DL-1B  have the option to have their 
axitinib dose increased to a maximum dose of 5 mg BID.  Particul ar attention should be 
provided to a patient’s overall safety profile prior to implemen ting intrapatient axitinib dose 
escalation.
Table 4. Axitinib Dose Levels
Dose Level Dose
+2 10 mg BID
+1 7 mg BID
Starting Dose 5 mg BID
-1 3 mg BID-2 2 mg BID
Patients will be monitored closely for toxicity, and axitinib t reatment may be adjusted by 
dosing interruption with or without dose reduction as indicated  in Table 4.  Dosing 
interruption and/or dose reduction by 1, and if needed, up to 2 dose levels (one dose level 
reduction at a time) will be allowed depending on the type and severity of toxicity 
encountered.  Management of patients requiring more than 2 dose reductions should be 
discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor.
Patients who have undergone dose reduction may also undergo dos e re-escalation back to the 
previous dose level at the discretion of the Investigator in th e absence of 
Grade ≥2 non- hematologic treatment-related toxicity for at least 28 days.
5.3.5.2. Management of Axitinib-Related Hypertension
Patients will be issued BP cuffs (provided by the sponsor) for home monitoring and 
instructed to measure their BP twice daily, prior to taking eac h axitinib dose.  All BP 
measurements will be recorded in a diary and brought to the nur se or study coordinator at 
each clinic visit.  Patients should be instructed to contact th e site immediately for guidance if 
their systolic blood pressure rises above 150 mm Hg, diastolic b lood pressure rises above 
100 mm Hg, or if they develop symptoms perceived to be related t o elevated blood pressure 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 85(eg, headache, visual disturbances), although a different blood pressure threshold for 
contacting the site may be used according to the investigator’s  clinical judgment.
Blood pressure should be well-controlled prior to initiating axi tinib, and patients should be 
monitored for hypertension.  To treat an increase in BP, standa rd antihypertensives may be 
used (for example, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiote nsin II receptor blockers, 
angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors, and di hydropyri dine [ DHP] calcium channel 
blockers.33,34
5.3.5.3. Axitinib Dose Modifications and Avelumab Infusion Omiss ions for 
Treatment-Related Toxicity
Recommended axitinib dose modifications and avelumab infusion o missions in case of 
drug-related toxicity are shown in Table 5 .  These guidelines might be further modified at the 
discretion of the sponsor based on the emerging safety profile o f the combination.  The 
investigator should discuss with the sponsor’s medical monitor any dose modification and or 
treatment discontinuation in case of persistent toxicity that w ould lead to dose modification
or treatment discontinuation per toxicity management guidelines .  Consult with the sponsor’s 
medical monitor before discontinuing the patient. 
Consider consulting with the sponsor’s medical monitor for Grad es 1 and 2 drug-related 
toxicities ( Table 5 ), and always consult with the sponsor’s medical monitor for Gr ades 3 and 
4 drug-related toxicities ( Table 5 ).090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 915.3.5.4. Special Precautions for Avelumab Administration
In order to mitigate avelumab infusion-related reactions, a pre medication with an 
antihistamine and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) approximatel y 30 to 60 minutes prior to 
each dose of avelumab is mandatory (for example, 25-50 mg diphen hydramine and 
500-650 mg paracetamol [acetaminophen] IV or oral equivalent).  This may be modified 
based on local treatment standards and guidelines, as appropria te. 
As with all monoclonal antibody therapies, there is a risk of a llergic reactions including 
anaphylactic shock.  Avelumab should be administered in a setti ng that allows for immediate 
access to an intensive care unit or equivalent environment and administration of therapy for 
anaphylaxis, such as the ability to implement immediate resusci tation measures.  Steroids 
(dexamethasone 10 mg), epinephrine (1:1,000 dilution), allergy me dications 
(IV antihistamines), bronchodilators, or equivalents, and oxygen  should be available for 
immediate access.
Infusion of avelumab will be stopped in case of Grade ≥2 infusion-related, allergic, or 
anaphylactic reactions.  If an allergic reaction occurs, the pa tient must be treated according to 
the best available medical practice.  Guidelines for the emerge ncy treatment of anaphylactic 
reactions are available at www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf (Working Group of the 
Resuscitation Council [United Kingdom], www.erc.edu (European R esuscitation Council 
[European Union]), www.heart.org (American Heart Association [U nited States]), and 
www.american cpr.com (American Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation [ CPR] Training™ 
[United States]).  Patients should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the 
investigator immediately. 
Treatment recommendations for the management of infusion-relate d reactions, severe 
hypersensitivity reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, and immune-re lated adverse events (irAEs) 
are outlined in Section 5.3.5.5 , 5.3.5.6 , 5.3.5.7 , 5.3.5.8 , respectively.
Investigators should also monitor patients closely for potentia l irAEs, which may become 
manifest at any time after the first dose of avelumab treatment . Such events may more often 
consist of persistent rash, diarrhea and colitis, autoimmune he patitis, arthritis, 
glomerulonephritis, cardiomyopathy, or uveitis and other inflam matory eye conditions.  
However, potential irAEs can occur in any organ or tissue.  Tre atment recommendations for 
the management of irAEs are outlined in Section 5.3.5.8 .
5.3.5.5. Management of Avelumab Infusion-Related Reactions 
Since avelumab is administered IV, infusion-related reactions m ay occur (with symptoms 
such as fever, chills, rigors, diaphoresis, and headache).  Tre atment of the infusion-related 
reaction and modifications of avelumab infusion are mainly depe ndent upon severity, as 
indicated in Table 6 . 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Grade 1 – mild
Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not 
indicated; intervention not indicated.Decrease the avelumab infusion rate by 50% and 
monitor closely for any worsening.The total infusion time for avelumab should not exceed 120 minutes.
Grade 2 – moderate
Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤24 hours .Stop avelumab infusion.
Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate as soon as 
infusion-related reaction has resolved or decreased to at least Grade 1 in severity, and monitor closely for any recurrence or worsening.
Grade 3 or Grade 4 – severe or life-threatening
Grade 3: Prolonged (eg, not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial 
improvement; hospitalization indicated for clinical 
sequelae.Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.Stop the avelumab infusion immediately and 
disconnect bag infusion tubing from the patient.Avelumab treatment must be permanently discontinued.
IV=intravenous, NCI CTCAE=National Cancer Institute Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
NSAIDs=non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Once the avelumab infusion rate has been decreased by 50% due t o an infusion-related 
reaction, it must remain so for all subsequent infusions.  The total infusion time for avelumab 
should not exceed 120 minutes.
Additional Modifications for Patients with Grade 2 Infusion-Rela ted Reactions 
In the event of a Grade 2 infusion-related reaction that does not  improve or worsens after 
implementation of the modifications indicated in Table 6 (includi ng reducing the infusion 
rate by 50%), the investigator may consider treatment with cort icosteroids, and the infusion 
should not be resumed for that cycle.  At the next cycle, the i nvestigator may consider the 
addition of H2-blocker antihistamines (eg, famotidine or raniti dine), meperidine, or 
ibuprofen to the mandatory premedication.  Prophylactic steroid s are NOT permitted.
5.3.5.6. Management of Avelumab-Related Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and 
Flu-Like Symptoms 
As with all monoclonal antibody therapies, avelumab can induce flu-like symptoms and 
hypersensitivity reactions, including impaired airway, decrease d oxygen saturation (<92%), 
confusion, lethargy , hypotension, pale/clammy skin, and cyanosi s.
Avelumab should be administered in a setting that allows for im mediate access to an 
intensive care unit or equivalent environment if required.  Pati ent should be placed on 
monitor immediately and epinephrine injection and dexamethasone  infusion should be 
available for immediate access.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

investigator.
Additional treatment recommendations for symptoms of avelumab i nfusion-related reactions 
are provided in Appendix 6 and may be modified based on local treatment standards and 
guidelines, as appropriate.
5.3.5.7. Management of Avelumab-Related Tumor Lysis Syndrome
Avelumab can induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxici ty (ADCC), so there is a
potential risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).  Should this occu r, patients should be treated as 
per local guidelines and the management algorithm ( Figure 1 ) published by Howard et al.35090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 955.3.5.8. Management of Avelumab Immune-Related Adverse Events
Since inhibition of PD-L1 stimulates the immune system, irAEs ma y occur.  Treatment of 
irAEs is mainly dependent upon severity (NCI CTCAE grade v. 4.0 3):
•Grade 1 to 2: treat symptomatically or with moderate-dose steroid s, more frequent 
monitoring;
•Grade 1 to 2 (persistent): manage similar to Grade 3 to 4 AE;
•Grade 3 to 4: treat with high-dose corticosteroids.
Treatment of irAEs should follow guidelines set forth in Table 7 . 
Some potential irAEs described with anti-PD-L1 drugs such as ave lumab may overlap with 
axitinib toxicities (eg, diarrhea, elevated liver function tests ).  Any adverse event suspected to 
be immune-related should be managed according to the guidance f or management of irAEs 
in this section .
For potential overlapping Grade 2 irAEs, hold both drugs used in  the combination (avelumab 
and axitinib) and follow the specific management recommendation s described in Table 7.  
When the event resolves to Grade ≤1, restart therapy with axiti nib.  If the Grade ≥2 event 
does not recur, restart avelumab at the beginning of the next t reatment cycle.  If the 
Grade ≥2 event does not resolve to Grade ≤1 after holding avelumab  for 2 treatment cycles 
(up to 28 days) or if the Grade ≥2 event recurs after re-introduc tion of avelumab, 
permanently discontinue avelumab therapy.
For potential overlapping Grade ≥3 irAEs, hold axitinib and foll ow the specific guidance in 
Table 7 for avelumab.  When the event resolves to Grade ≤1, resta rt therapy with axitinib at 
reduced dose level.  Avelumab should be permanently discontinue d.

5.4. Investigational Product Storage 
The investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist ), will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area with cont rolled access under required 
storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements. 
Investigational product should be stored in its original contai ner and in accordance with the 
label.
•Axitinib must be stored at controlled room temperature (between  15-30 °C) or as 
specified on the label.
•Avelumab must be stored in the refrigerator (between 2-8 °C) or as specified on the 
label. 
Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, investigator’s broch ure) will be superseded by the 
storage conditons stated on the label. 
Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site st orage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperat ure products).  This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throu ghout the study.  Even for 
continuous monitoring systems, a log or site procedure that ens ures active daily evaluation 
for excursions should be documented.  The operation of the temp erature monitoring device 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 102and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, sh ould be regularly inspected to 
ensure it is maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should  be reported upon discovery.  
The site should actively pursue options for returning the produ ct to the storage conditions as 
described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations fro m the storage requirements, 
including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to  the sponsor. 
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product mu st be quarantined and not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use t he investigational product.  It 
will not be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor appr oves the use of the 
investigational product after the temperature excursion.  Use o f the investigational product 
prior to sponsor approval will be considered a protocol deviati on. 
Specific details regarding information the site should report f or each excursion will be 
provided to the site. 
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routi ne handling operations where 
the product(s) are briefly out of the temperature range describ ed in the labeling are not 
considered excursions. 
Site staff will instruct patients on the proper storage require ments for take-home 
investigational products.
5.5. Investigational Product Accountability 
The investigative site must maintain adequate records documenti ng the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product-supplies.  All  bottles of study drug must be 
returned to the investigator by the patient at every visit and at the end of the trial, Pfizer will 
provide instructions as to disposition of any unused investigat ional product. 
5.6. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destructio n of unused investigational 
product (eg, at the site).  If destruction is authorized to tak e place at the study site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in co mpliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any specia l instructions provided by 
Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequately documented.
5.7. Concomitant Treatments(s)
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the Excl usion Criteria ( Section 4.2 ) are 
also not allowed during the active treatment period, except for  administration of the 
inactivated influenza vaccine.
If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other med ications or vaccinations 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from study therapy or 
medication/vaccination may be required.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient’s pr imary phys ician.  However, the 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 103decision to continue the patient on study therapy or medication /vaccination schedule requires 
the mutual agreement of the investigator, the sponsor, and the patient. 
Concomitant treatment considered necessary for the patient’s we ll being may be given at the 
discretion of the treating physician.
All concomitant treatments, blood products, as well as non-drug  interventions received by 
patients from screening until the end of study visit will be re corded on the CRF. 
Concomitant medications and treatments, including herbal supple ments, will be recorded 
from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and up to 90 d ays after the last dose of 
study treatment.  All concomitant medications should be recorde d in the CRF including 
supportive care drugs (eg, antiemetic treatment and prophylaxis ), and the drugs used to treat 
adverse events or chronic diseases, and non-drug supportive int erventions (eg, transfusions).
Concurrent anticancer therapy with agents other than avelumab a nd axitinib is not allowed.  
Medications intended solely for supportive care (ie, antiemetic s, analgesics, megestrol 
acetate for anorexia) are allowed.
Recommended medications to treat infusion-related reactions, hy persensitivity reactions, 
flu-like symptoms, tumor lysis syndrome and immune-related even ts are reported in 
Sections 5.3.5.5, 5.3.5.6 , 5.3.5.7 , and 5.3.5.8 , respectively. 
5.7.1. Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP Enzymes
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and recombinant CY P enzymes indicate that 
axitinib metabolism is primarily mediated by the CYP3A4/5, and to a lesser extent by 
CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1. 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (eg, ketoconaz ole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, and voriconazole) should be avoided.  Selection of an alternate concomitant 
medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is r ecommended.  Although 
axitinib dose adjustments have not been studied in patients rec eiving strong 
CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, consider dose reduction if axitinib must be  used with a 
CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. 
If coadministration of the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is discontin ued, the axitinib dose 
should be re-escalated (after 10 days) to that used prior to ini tiation of the strong 
CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. 
Coadministration of axitinib with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (eg, rifampin, dexamethasone, 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital,  and St. John’s wort) should be 
avoided.  Selection of concomitant medication with no or minima l CYP3A4/5 induction 
potential is recommended.  Moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers (eg, bosen tan, efavirenz, 
etravirine, modafinil, and nafcillin) may also reduce the plasm a exposure of axitinib and 
should be avoided if possible.  Consider dose escalation if axi tinib must be used with a 
CYP3A4/5 inducer.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

be de-escalated (after 10 days) to that used prior to initiation  of the strong 
CYP3A4/5 inducer.
5.7.2. Hematopoietic Growth Factors
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be used in agreement with American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.46
Patients who enter the study on stable doses of erythropoietin or darbepoietin may continue 
this treatment, and patients may start either drug during the s tudy at the discretion of the 
treating physician if clinically indicated.
5.7.3. Concomitant Surgery 
No formal studies of the effect of axitinib on wound healing ha ve been conducted; however, 
caution is advised based on the mechanism of action.  If a majo r surgery or an interventional 
procedure (eg, endoscopy) is required, treatment with axitinib must be interrupted at least 
24 hours before the procedure, and the patient BP should be moni tored closely for 
hypotension.  Patients may resume axitinib 7 days after minor su rgery and 2-3 weeks after 
major surgery, assuming the wound has completely healed and the re are no wound healing 
complications (eg, delayed healing, wound infection or fistula) .
In case of surgical procedure avelumab treatment should be dela yed.  Reinitiation should be 
discussed with the sponsor.
5.7.4. Concomitant Radiotherapy
Local radiotherapy (limited field) of isolated lesions with pal liative intent is acceptable and 
allowed throughout the study (ie, starting from the screening t hrough end of treatment) if 
considered medically necessary by the treating physician.  All attempts should be made to 
rule out disease progression in the event of increased localize d pain.  If palliative 
radiotherapy is needed to control pain, the site(s) of disease causing pain should be present at 
baseline; otherwise, painful lesion(s) requiring radiotherapy w ill be considered as a sign of 
disease progression.  The Medical Monitor should be consulted p rior to starting radiotherapy 
and prior to restarting study treatment after the end of radiot herapy.
5.7.5. Other Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Therapies 
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the treatment phase of 
this trial: 
•Immunotherapy, immunosuppressive  drugs (ie, chemo therapy or sys temic 
corticosteroids except for short-term treatment of allergic rea ctions or for the 
treatment of irAEs).  Short-term administration of systemic ste roids (eg, for allergic 
reactions or the management of irAEs) is allowed.  Topical and inhalation steroids are 
allowed.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 105•Any vaccine therapies for the prevention of infectious disease within 4 weeks after 
the start of study treatment, except administration of the inac tive influenza vaccine. 
•Bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment is not allowed unless it has been initiated 
more than 14 days prior to receiving the first administration of  avelumab.
•Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy or inve stigational agents 
other than avelumab and axitinib. 
•Other experimental pharmaceutical products.
•Herbal remedies with immunostimulating properties (eg, mistle t oe extract) or known 
to potentially interfere with major organ function (eg, hyperic in).
Clarifications about Steroid Use : Data indicate that corticosteroids have an adverse effect 
on T cell function and that they inhibit and damage lymphocytes .36,37Furthermore, as with 
all immunotherapies intended to augment cell-mediated immunity,  there is a risk that 
concomitant immunosuppressives such as steroids will counteract  the intended benefit of the 
proposed study treatment.  However, studies with anti-CTLA-4 com pounds indicate that 
short-term use of steroids may be employed without compromising  clinical outcomes.38
Therefore, the use of steroids during this trial is restricted as follows:
•Therapeutic use: for the treatment of infusion-related reaction s and short-term 
treatment of irAEs, steroids are permitted according to the mod alities indicated in 
Table 7 .
•Physiologic use: steroid replacement for adrenal insufficiency at doses equivalent to 
≤10 mg prednisone daily is acceptable.
•Prophylactic use, eg, for the prevention of acute infusion-rela ted reactions: is 
prohibited, except prior to CT or MRI scan.
There are no prohibited therapies during the Post-Treatment Fol low-up Phase. 
5.8. Rescue Medications and Supportive Care 
5.8.1. Supportive Care Guidelines 
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as  deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator including but not limited to the items ou tlined below: 
•Diarrhea: All patients who experience diarrhea should be advise d to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is  not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 106•Nausea/Vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressi vely, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the admin istration of 
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard instituti onal practice.  Patients 
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid in take. 
•Anti-infectives: Patients with a documented infectious complica tion should receive 
oral or IV antibiotics or other anti-infective agents as consid ered appropriate by the 
treating investigator for a given infectious condition, accordi ng to standard 
institutional practice.  Prophylactic administration should be considered for the cases 
outlined in Table 7 .
•Anti-inflammatory or narcotic analgesics may be offered as need ed.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol to a maximum total daily dose of 2 g i s permitted.  Daily 
intake over 2 g is prohibited.
•Patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy during treatme nt should be treated 
with low molecular weight heparin.  If low molecular weight hep arin cannot be 
administered, coumadin or other coumarin derivatives or other a nti-coagulants 
(including direct Xa inhibitors) may be allowed; however, appro priate monitoring of 
prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) should  be performed. 
6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1. Screening
For screening procedures, see Schedule of Activities table and Assessments section 
(Section 7 ). 
6.1.1. Tumor Biospecimens
Provision of tumor biospecimen will be required for enrollment onto the study as follows:
1. Recent tumor biospecimen: a mandatory FFPE tumor tissue block  from a de novo
tumor biopsy must be obtained from all patients during screenin g.  The biopsied 
tumor lesion should not be a RECIST target lesion.   
 
 
 
 
2. Archival tumor biospecimen: a mandatory archival FFPE tumor t issue block from the 
primary diagnosis specimen must be provided from all patients p rior to 
enrollment/randomization.

withdrawn consent to be followed for survival.
6.5. Patient Withdrawal
Patients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own r equest, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability of the patient to comply with the pro tocol- required schedule of study 
visits or procedures at a given study site. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )CCI

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 108Reasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include:
•Objective disease progression.  However, patients with disease progression who are 
continuing to derive clinical benefit from the study treatment will be eligible to 
continue with single-agent avelumab or axitinib, or with avelum ab in combination 
with axitinib , provided that the treating physician has determ ined that the benefit/risk 
for doing so is favorable (see Section 5.3.3.3 );
•Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation ;
•Unacceptable toxicity.  If the unacceptable toxicity is attribu ted to one of the two 
study treatments, the investigator (in discussion with the spon sor) may continue 
treatment with the other study treatment;
•Pregnancy;
•Significant protocol violation;
•Lost to follow-up;
•Patient refused further treatment (follow-up permitted by patie nt);
•Study terminated by sponsor;
•Death.
Reasons for withdrawal from study follow-up may include:
•Study terminated by sponsor;
•Lost to follow-up;
•Refused further follow-up;
•Death.
If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effor t should be made to contact the 
patient.  All attempts to contact the patient and information r eceived during contact attempts 
must be documented in the patient’s medical record.  In any cir cumstance, every effort 
should be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  The i nvestigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request the patient to return all unused investigational 
product(s), request that the patient return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with 
the patient regarding any unresolved AEs.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 109If the patient withdraws from the study, and also withdraws con sent for disclosure of future 
information, then no further evaluations should be performed, a nd no additional data should 
be collected.  The sponsor will retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
7. ASSESSMENTS
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol require d tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from t ime to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, that  may make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator will take a ll steps necessary to ensure the 
safety and well being of the patient.  When a protocol required  test cannot be performed the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any correcti ve and preventive actions 
which he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are a dhered to as soon as possible.  
The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.
7.1. Safety Assessment
Safety will be monitored at regular intervals throughout the st udy by means of laboratory 
tests and clinical visits as described in the Schedule of Activities table. 
7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing
For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum pregnanc y test, with sensitivity of at 
least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on up to 3 occasions prior to starting combination study 
treatment - once at the start of screening (all patients), and on ce at Lead-in Day 1 (patients in 
Dose Finding Phase only and up to approximately 8 additional pat ients enrolled for further 
PK assessment) immediately before axitinib administration, and at the Cycle 1 Day 1 visit 
(all patients) immediately before the administration of aveluma b in combination with 
axitinib.  Following a negative pregnancy test result at screen ing, appropriate contraception 
must be commenced and another negative pregnancy test result wi ll then be required at the 
baseline visit before the patient may receive the investigation al product.  Additional 
pregnancy tests (serum or urine) will also be routinely repeate d at every cycle during the 
active treatment period, at the end of study treatment, and dur ing short tem Fu period, and 
additionally whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed or when potent ial pregnancy is otherwise 
suspected.  In the case of a positive hCG test, the patient wil l be withdrawn from treatment 
but may remain in the study. 
Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by Institutional Review 
Board/Ethics Committees (IRB/ECs) or if required by local regul ations.
7.1.2. Adverse Events
Assessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by NCI 
CTCAE version 4.03), timing, seriousness, and relatedness.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Haematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis will be collected at the time points described 
in the Schedule of Activities table and analyzed at local laboratories.  They may also be 
performed when clinically indicated.  The required laboratory t ests are listed in Table 8 .  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results shoud be rep eated as soon as possible 
(preferably within 24-48 hours) and followed up as per standard clinical practice unless 
otherwise specified in this protocol.

7.1.4. Vital Signs and Physical Examination
Physical examinations will be performed according to institutio nal guidelines on study days 
as described in the Schedule of Activities table. 
The physical examination will include major body systems, weigh t (height will be measured 
at screening only), assessment of ECOG performance status. 
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate) will be measured at th e time points described in the 
Schedule of Activities table.  Blood pressure and pulse rate should be taken with the patient 
in the seated position after the patient has been sitting quiet ly for at least 5 minutes.  Two 
blood pressure and pulse rate readings will be taken at least 1 hour apart at each clinic visit 
(every 6 weeks after amendment #4 approval). 
In addition, all patients will be monitoring BP at home as desc ribed in Section 5.3.5.2 .
7.1.5. (12-Lead) Electrocardiogram Measurements
A standard 12-lead (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will  be used for all ECG 
assessments. 
All patients require a triplicate ECG measurement at screening and on treatment.  
On-treatment ECGs will be performed on Lead-in Day 7 (patients i n Dose-Finding Phase and 
and up to approximately 8 additional patients enrolled to assess  the effect of avelumab on the 
PK of axitinib), Cycle 1 Day 1 (all patients), Cycle 4 Day 1 (all p atients), and End of 
Treatment/Withdrawal.  At each time point, 3 consecutive 12-lead  ECGs (triplicates) will be 
performed approximately 2 minutes apart to determine mean QTc (a verage of triplicates).  
Triplicate ECGs at Cycle 1 Day 1 will be prior to avelumab infusi on and within 30 minutes 
post end of -infusion.  When coinciding with blood sample draws  for PK, ECG assessment 
should be performed prior to blood sample collection such that the blood sample is collected 
at the nominal time. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

B9991002 
Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 113Clinically significant findings seen on subsequent ECGs should be recorded as adverse 
events.  In case of QTc >500 msec (ie, CTCAE Grade >2), ECG must be  reviewed by 
qualified personnel at the site as soon as the finding is made,  including verifying that the 
machine reading is accurate and that the Fridericia correction formula is applied.  If the 
manual reading verifies a rate corrected QTc of >500 msec, a repe at ECG should be 
immediately performed at least two times approximately 2 to 4 min utes apart. 
An electronic reading of prolonged QTc must be confirmed by man ual reading.  Prior to 
conclusion that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug, thorough 
consideration should be given to potential precipitating factor s (eg, change in patient clinical 
condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturb ance) and possible evaluation 
by specialist.  If QTc interval reverts to less than 500 msec, a nd in the judgment of 
investigator and sponsor is determined to be due to a cause othe r than study drug, treatment 
may be continued with regular ECG monitoring.
If patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (eg, syncope, dizziness, seizures, or stroke), 
then triplicate ECGs should be obtained at time of the event.  If the mean QTc is prolonged 
(>500 msec), then the ECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified  person at the institution for 
confirmation and repeated as clinically indicated.  Additional triplicate ECGs may be 
performed as clinically indicated.
7.2. Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Plasma/serum samples will be obtained from patients for PK anal ysis of avelumab and 
axitinib depending on the study phase (Dose Finding or Dose Expa nsion) that they belong to.  
Samples for avelumab PK will be collected from all patients in the study.  Axitinib PK 
samples will be collected from all patients in the Dose Finding  Phase and, if needed, up to 
approximately 8 additional patients enrolled to assess the effec t of avelumab on the PK of 
axitinib. 
7.2.1. Blood Sample Collection for Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Where noted in the Schedule of Activities table, blood samples will be collected at 
approximately the same time as other assessments wherever possi ble. 
The PK table indicates PK blood sampling time points for axitini b alone and avelumab in 
combination with axitinib.  For all PK blood sample collections , the actual time of avelumab 
and axitinib dosing, as well as actual times of PK collections,  will be recorded in the source 
documents and CRF.  On the days of axitinib PK sample collectio n, patients should be 
instructed to hold morning axitinib dosing until the pre-dose s ample has been drawn.  
Patients should have been taking axitinib uninterrupted for at least 3 days prior to each of the 
axitinib PK sample collection visits.  Patients who do not take  the scheduled axitinib doses 
for 3 consecutive days prior, must reschedule PK sample collecti ons to a future date.  If this 
occurs in the axitinib Lead-in period, it may delay Cycle 1 Day 1;  if it occurs during 
treatment cycles, it may delay Cycle 4 Day 1 avelumab infusion.  Fo r all PK collections, the 
actual time of avelumab and axitinib dosing, as well as actual times of PK collections will be 
recorded in the source documents and CRF. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

B9991002 
Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 114Blood samples for axitinib PK and avelumab PK will be collected  as outlined in the Schedule 
for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collections table.  PK sampling schedule may be modified 
based on emerging PK data. 
PK samples for avelumab will also be collected at the Day 30 Fol low-up visit after the end of 
avelumab treatment. 
In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, additi onal blood samples for axitinib 
and avelumab should be collected from patients experiencing une xpected and/or serious AEs 
and the date and time of blood sample collection and of the las t dosing prior to PK collection 
documented in the CRF.
All efforts will be made to obtain the PK samples at the schedu led nominal time relative to 
dosing.  However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal ti me (eg, within 6 minutes of 
a 60-minute sample) will be considered protocol compliant, and the exact time of the sample 
collection noted on the CRF.  If a scheduled blood sample colle ction cannot be completed for 
any reason, the missed sample collection may be rescheduled wit h agreement of the 
investigator and sponsor.
PK samples will be assayed for avelumab and axitinib using vali dated analytical methods.  
Additional details regarding the collection, processing, storag e, and shipping of the blood 
samples will be provided in the study manual.  As part of the u nderstanding of the PK of the 
study drug, samples may be used for potential qualitative and/o r quantitative metabolite 
analyses and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical methods for ave lumab and axitinib.  The 
results of such analyses may be included in the clinical report .
7.2.2. Collection of Axitinib Pharmacokinetic Samples
At each time point for axitinib, a 3 mL whole blood sample will be collected into an 
appropriately labeled K 3EDTA tube to provide a minimum of 1 mL plasma for axitinib PK 
analysis.
7.2.3. Collection of Avelumab Pharmacokinetic Samples
A total of 3.5 mL of whole blood will be collected into a serum separator tube (SST) at the 
designated times to provide serum for avelumab PK analysis.
7.3. Immunogenicity Assessment
A total of 3.5 mL of whole blood will be collected into a SST at  the designated times to 
provide serum for evaluation of avelumab immunogenicity.  Immun ogenicity blood samples 
will be assayed for anti-avelumab antibodies using a validated analytical method.  All of the 
samples that are positive for ADA may also undergo characteriza tion for neutralizing 
antibodies.  Additional details regarding the collection, proce ssing, storage, and shipping of 
the blood samples will be provided in the Study Manual.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 1157.4. Translational and Pharmacodynamic Assessments
A key objective of the biomarker analyses that will be performe d in this study is to 
investigate candidate biomarkers that may have predictive value  in identifying those patients 
who may benefit from treatment with the combination of avelumab  and axitinib.  In addition, 
analyses of sequentially obtained blood biomarkers will provide  an opportunity to investigate 
pharmacodynamic effects.  Samples collected at the End of Treat ment visit will also help 
understand potential mechanisms of resistance to the drug combi nation.
 
 
 
Tumor biopsies obtained at the time of discontinuation of eithe r drugs and at the End of 
Treatment will be used to investigate acquired mechanisms of re sistance.  Only core needle 
or excisional biopsies, or resection specimen are suitable.  Cy tologic preparations, such as 
fine needle aspirate biopsies, are not acceptable.  Additional information on tissue collection 
procedures can be found in the Study Manual.

Page 1187.6. Tumor Assessments
Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease s ites.  Imaging may include 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT or MRI scans; it may also include  brain CT or MRI scan at 
baseline and whenever brain metastases are suspected.  The CT a nd MRI scans should be 
performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medic al reasons. 
The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified  and reported lesion at 
baseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.
Antitumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at 
baseline, at 6 weeks after the fi rst dose of therapy (Cycle 1 Day  1), then every 6 weeks up to 
1 year from the first dose of therapy, and then every 12 weeks th ereafter until documented 
disease progression regardless of initiation of subsequent anti cancer therapy.  In addition, 
radiological tumor assessments will also be conducted whenever disease progression is 
suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration) and at the time of wit hdrawal from the treatment 
(if not done in the previous 6 weeks).  CR and PR must be confir med with repeat imaging 
performed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of respons e.  If radiological imaging 
shows PD, then tumor assessment should be repeated after at lea st 4 weeks to confirm PD, 
unless clinical deterioration occurs.  See Schedule of Activities table and Section 5.3.3.3 for 
treatment after initial evidence of disease progression.
Brain CT or MRI scans are required at baseline and when there i s a suspected brain 
metastasis.  Bone scan (bone  scinti graphy) or 18FDG-PET/CT is required at baseline then 
every 12 weeks only if bone metastases are present at baseline.  Otherwise, bone imaging is 
required only if new bone metastases are suspected.  Bone imagi ng is also required at the 
time of confirmation of complete response for patients who have  bone metastases.  
Otherwise, bone imaging is required only if new bone metastases  are suspected and at the 
time of confirmation of CR for patients who have bone metastase s.
Measurable or evaluable lesions that have been previously irrad iated will not be considered 
target lesions unless increase in size has been observed follow ing completion of radiation 
therapy.
Assessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 ( Appendix 2 )  
All patients’ files and radiologic images must be available for  source verification and for 
potential peer review by a third party.
8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1. Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group o r suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported  as described in the following 
sections. CCI090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )
MSB0010718C, AG-013736
B9991002 
Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 119For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain informatio n adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criter ia for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated re presentative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator t o determine the causality of the 
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality.  Follow- up by the investigator may be 
required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize a t a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the sponsor, any  non-serious adverse event 
that is determined by the sponsor to be serious will be reporte d by the sponsor as an SAE.  To 
assist in the determination of case seriousness, further inform ation may be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study. 
8.2. Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designat ed representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is o btained prior to the patient’s 
participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-r elated procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including 90 cale ndar days after the last 
administration of the study treatment. 
SAEs occurring to a patient after the active reporting period h as ended should be reported to 
the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a min imum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of  being related to investigational 
product are to be reported to the sponsor. 
AEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF fro m the time the patient has 
taken at least one dose of study treatment through and includin g 90 calendar days after the 
last administration of study treatment.  If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE 
reporting period for nonserious AEs ends at the time the new tr eatment is started.  Death 
must be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting period a fter the last dose of study 
treatment, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investig ation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limite d to: 
•Abnormal test findings;
•Clinically significant symptoms and signs;
•Changes in physical examination findings;
•Hypersensitivity;090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )
MSB0010718C, AG-013736
B9991002 
Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 120•Drug abuse;
•Drug dependency.
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:
•Drug overdose;
•Drug withdrawal;
•Drug misuse; 
•Drug interactions;
•Extravasation;
•Exposure during pregnancy (EDP);
•Exposure via breastfeeding;
•Medication error;
•Occupational exposure;
•Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study s hould be reported 
as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progress ion assessed by 
measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other method s should not be 
reported as AEs.
8.3.1. Avelumab Adverse Events of Special Interest
Any AE that is suspected to be a potential irAE is considered a n AE of special interest 
(AESI).  Specific guidance for the management of irAEs is provi ded in Section 5.3.5.8 .  
AESIs are reported according to the general AE reporting rules specified in Section 8.1 and 
8.2.
8.4. Medication Errors
Medication errors may result, in this study, from the administr ation or consumption of the 
wrong product, by the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at th e wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page, and on t he serious adverse event 
(SAE) form when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing  error, the sponsor should 
be notified immediately.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )
MSB0010718C, AG-013736
B9991002 
Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 121Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence o f an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
•Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigati onal product;
•Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen  in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating patient.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as  determined by the 
investigator, the medication error is captured on the medicatio n error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, any associated AEs are captured on an AE CR F page. 
The guidance on reporting of medication errors also applies to the reporting of overdose.
For purposes of this study, an overdose is defined as an increa se ≥5% than the planned 
avelumab dose for that particular administration. 
For axitinib, an overdose is defined as a dose greater than 10 m g BID. 
There is no specific treatment for overdose of avelumab or axit inib.  In the event of overdose, 
the patient should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment 
should be provided if clinically indicated. 
8.5. Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test  finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows: 
•Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or
•Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/s urgical intervention; 
and/or
•Test result leads to a change in study dosing outside of protoc ol-stipulated dose 
adjustments or discontinuation from the study, significant addi tional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or
•Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or sp onsor.
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the  above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 1228.6. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at a ny dose that:
•Results in death;
•Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (sub stantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions);
•Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;
•Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcom e is fatal within the 
safety reporting period.  Hospitalization due to signs and symp toms of disease 
progression should not be reported as an SAE.  If the malignanc y has a fatal outcome 
during the study or within the safety reporting period, then th e event leading to death 
must be recorded as an AE and as an SAE with CTCAE (version 4.0 3) Grade 5 (see 
the section on Severity Assessment ).
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whe ther an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediate ly life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determin ed that the event may jeopardize 
the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the o ther AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs w ill be reported by the 
investigator as described in previous sections, and will be han dled as SAEs in the safety 
database (see section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ). 
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent with abnormal elev ations in total bilirubin 
that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other ca uses of liver injury are 
considered potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (potent ial Hy’s Law cases) and should 
always be considered important medical events. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 123The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury 
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underly ing conditions.  Patients who 
present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be e valuated further to 
definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
•Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values wit hin the normal range 
who subsequently present with AST or ALT values ≥3 × ULN concurrent with a 
total bilirubin value ≥2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline 
phosphatase value ≤2 × ULN or not available.
•For patients with preexisting ALT OR AST ORtotal bilirubin values above the ULN, 
the following threshold values should be used in the definition  mentioned above:
•For patients with preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal 
range, AST or ALT value ≥2 times the baseline values and ≥3 × ULN, or 
≥8 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
•Concurrent with:
•For patients with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above th e normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased from baseline by an amount of at leas t 1 × ULN orif the 
value reaches ≥3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
The patient should return to the investigational site and be ev aluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal result s.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessm ent.  The possibility of hepatic 
neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered.  In addi tion to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include al bumin, creatine kinase, 
total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin 
time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline ph osphatase.  A detailed history, 
including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acet aminophen, recreational drug, 
and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposu re, sexual history, travel 
history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, b lood transfusion, history of liver 
or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  F urther testing for acute 
hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary t ract) may be warranted.  All 
cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory cri teria defined above, with no 
other cause for Liver Function Test (LFT) abnormalities identif ied at the time should be 
considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availabilit y of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s 
Law cases should be reported as SAEs.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 1248.7. Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation of an existi ng admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive car e unit (eg, from the psychiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit,  or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency room visit does not necessari ly constitute an 
hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency ro om visit should be assessed 
for medical importance.
Hospitalization does not include the following:
•Rehabilitation facilities;
•Hospice facilities;
•Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);
•Skilled nursing facilities;
•Nursing homes;
•Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedure s).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absen ce of a precipitating, clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include: 
•Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associat ed with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of persistent pre-treatment laboratory abnormality);
•Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);
•Administrative admission (eg, for yearly phys ical examination);
•Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg, for a procedur e required by the study 
protocol);
•Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical  AE (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery);
•Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
•Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual  patient;
•Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 125Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures , such as surgery, should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which t he procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For ex ample, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported a s the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8. Severity Assessment
GRADE Clinical Description of Severity
0 No Change from normal or reference range (This grade is not in cluded in the 
Version 4.03 CTCAE document but may be used in certain circumsta nces.)
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness o f an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily an SAE.  For example, a headache may be severe (int erferes significantly with 
patient's usual function) but would not be classified as seriou s unless it met one of the criteria 
for SAEs listed above.
8.9. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for  all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relations hip in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious ad verse reporting requirements 
if applicable.  An investigator’s causality assessment is the d etermination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational produc t caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a ca usal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the  investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to invest igational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined by the iponsor (see the section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related  to investigational product”, 
this should be clearly documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associate d with study procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source  documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with t he SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
For combination treatments, causality assessment will be perfor med for each of the 
individual drugs included in the combination. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 1268.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed produc ts, an exposure during 
pregnancy occurs if:
•A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while rece iving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to  the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after  discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving d irect contact with 
a Pfizer product in a pregnant women (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
•A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmen tal exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of concepti on and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy.
If a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is fou nd to be pregnant during the 
study patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the  investigator must submit this 
information to the Pfizer drug safety unit on an SAE report for m and EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer produc t in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
patient reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation 
or spillage) using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be don e irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure .  The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy).
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pre gnancy and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will  follow the pregnancy until 
completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer o f the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live bi rth, the structural integrity of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, th e structural integrity of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findin gs are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE ( ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death , or congenital anomaly [in a 
live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demis e, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are report ed as SAEs follows: 
•Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 127•Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be rep orted, without regard 
to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month  should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related  or possibly related to 
exposure to the investigational product. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by th e investigator.  Further 
follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case b asis (eg, follow-up on 
preterm infants to identify dev elopmental delays ).  In the case  of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Pa rtner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document  in the source documents that 
the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Informati on Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of  job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplan ned direct contact with the 
product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit wi thin 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless  of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a  patient enrolled in the study, 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy of th e completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (see Also the Section on Patient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal d ue to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded o n the appropriate AE CRF 
page. 
When a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be rep orted in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all  AEs spontaneously reported by 
the study patient/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally acceptable r epresentative.  In addition, each 
study patient/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally acceptable repre sentative will be questioned 
about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria  for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulat ions, as appropriate.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 1288.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of in vestigator awareness of the 
event.  In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life-threatening,  notification to Pfizer must be 
made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE in formation.  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previ ously forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of EDP, expos ure via breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware o f the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks  treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learni ng of it and document the time 
of his or her first awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provi de information to Pfizer in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more  detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and indepen dent determination of 
possible causality.  Information on other possible causes of th e event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines and/or illnesses must be provided.  In th e case of a patient death, a 
summary of available autopsy escalations must be submitted as s oon as possible to Pfizer or 
its designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It shou ld be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  W here the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE 
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported usin g concise medical 
terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection o f SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authoriti es
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious  adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of th e data collected in this study 
will be documented in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer.

9.2. Statistical Methods and Properties
9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Dose Escalation/De-Escalation: mT PI
Many alternative designs have been proposed to the standard 3+3 design for Phase 1 dose 
escalation trials that improve accuracy, efficiency, and statis tical validity. 
The modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design29is an interval-type of design that
uses a Bayesian statistics framework and a beta/binomial hierar chical model to compute the 
posterior probability of 3 dosing intervals that reflect the rela tive difference in probability 
between the toxicity rate of each dose level to the target rate  (pT = 0.33).  If the toxicity rate 
of the currently used dose level is far smaller than pT, the mT PI will recommend escalating 
the dose level; if it is close to pT, the mTPI will recommend c ontinuing at the current dose; if 
it is far greater than pT, the mTPI will recommend de-escalatin g the dose level.  These rules 
are conceptually similar to those used by the 3+3 design, except  the decisions of an mTPI 
design are based on posterior probabilities calculated under a coherent probability model. 
Being a model-based design, mTPI automatically and appropriatel y tailors dose-escalation 
and de-escalation decisions for different trials with different  toxicity parameters.  More 
importantly, all the dose-escalation decisions for a given tria l can be pre-calculated under the 
mTPI design.  Thus, compared to other advanced model-based desi gns published in the 
literature, the mTPI design is logistically less complicated an d easier to implement. 
Decision rules are based on calculating unit probability mass ( UPM) of 3 dosing intervals 
corresponding to under, proper, and over dosing in terms of tox icity.  Specifically, the 
underdosing interval is defined as (0; pT-e 1), the over-dosing interval (pT+e 2), and the 
proper-dosing interval (pT- e 1, pT+ e 2), where e 1and e 2are small fractions.  Based on the 
safety profile of Avelumab as a single-agent in Study EMR100070 -001, e 1is selected as 
0.05, and e 2is selected as 0.03.  Therefore, the target dosing interval for  the DLT rate is 
(0.25, 0.33).
The 3 dosing intervals are associated with 3 different dose-escal ation decisions.  The 
under-dosing interval corresponds to a dose escalation (E), ove r-dosing corresponds to a dose 
de-escalation (D), and proper-dosing corresponds to remaining a t the current dose (R).  
Given a dosing interval and a probability distribution, the UPM  of that dosing interval is 
defined as the probability of a patient belonging to that dosin g interval divided by the length 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )
MSB0010718C, AG-013736
B9991002 
Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 131of the dosing interval.  The mTPI design calculates the UPMs fo r the 3 dosing intervals, and 
the one with the largest UPM informs the corresponding dose-fin ding decision, which is the 
dose level to be used for future patients.  For example, if the  under-dosing interval has the 
largest UPM, the decision will be to escalate, and the next coh ort of patients will be treated at 
the next higher dose level.  Ji and collaborators29have demonstrated that the decision based 
on UPM is optimal in that it minimizes a posterior expected los s (ie, minimizes the chance of 
making a wrong dosing decision). 
The dose finding component of the trial (Phase 1) uses a modifie d version of the mTPI 
design that maximizes the number of evaluable patients treated at each dose level at 6.  Dose 
finding is completed when 6 evaluable patients have been treated  at the highest dose with 
DLT rate <0.33.
9.3. Sample Size Determination
The sample size planned for the dose finding part arises from l ogistic feasibility and is not 
entirely driven by statistical considerations.  Due to the dyna mic nature of the dose allocation 
procedure and unknown safety profile of the combination, the sa mple size of the interval 
design cannot be determined in advance.  It is expected that ap proximately 15 DLT-evaluable 
patients will be required for the dose finding phase.
Up to approximately 40 patients will be included in the dose exp ansion phase of the study for 
each MTD dose level cohort expanded.  A sample size of 40 patient s will provide at least 
90% probability to observe at least 1 AE if the true incidence of  the AE in the population is 
≥6%. 
Based on the emerging PK data and after the completion of the d ose-finding part of study 
phase on mTPI method, it may be necessary to enroll up to appro ximately 8 additional 
patients to further assess the effect of avelumab on the PK of axitinib.  These additional 
patients will undergo the same evaluations and procedures as th ose described in the Schedule 
of Activities for the Dose Finding Phase of the study and will be treated con currently with 
the initiation of the Dose Expansion Phase. 
9.4. Efficacy Analysis 
In this study, assessement of anti-tumor activity is a secondar y objective.  Efficacy analyses 
will be presented in the form of statistical summaries and data  listings for the Dose 
Expansion Phase.  For patients enrolled in the Dose Finding Pha se, only data listings for best 
overall response (BOR) may be presented. 
This study may include randomization to study treatments (see Section 5.1 ).  Efficacy 
endpoints will be defined based on ‘start date’ which is the start date of study treatment for 
patients who are not randomized, or the date of randomization f or patients who are 
randomized to DL-1A or DL-1B.
9.4.1. Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints

Disease Control (DC) is defined as OR (CR or PR) or stable dise ase (SD) per RECIST 
v1.1 from the start date until the first documentation of object ive disease progression or death 
due to any cause.  DCR is defined as the proportion of patients  with DC.
Time to Tumor Response (TTR) is defined as the time from start date to the first 
documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that is su bsequently confirmed.
Duration of Response (DR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective 
tumor response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed to the  first documentation of 
objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, which ever occurs first. The 
censoring rules for DR are as defined below for PFS. 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the  start date to the date of the 
first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or  death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first.  PFS data will be censored on the date of the last adequate tumor 
assessment for patients who do not have an event (PD or death),  for patients who start new 
anti-cancer treatment prior to a PFS event, or for patients wit h a PFS event after ≥2 missing 
tumor assessments.  Patients who do not have a baseline tumor as sessment or who do not 
have any post-baseline tumor assessments will be censored on th e start date unless death 
occurred on or before the time of the first planned post-baseli ne tumor assessment in which 
case the death will be considered an event.
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the start date to the date of death due to any 
cause.  Patients last known to be alive will be censored at the date of last contact.
ORR and DCR will be estimated and the corresponding exact 2-side d 95% confidence 
intervals will be reported.  TTR will be summarized using simple  descriptive statistics 
(eg, median and range). DR, PFS, and OS will be analyzed using Kap lan-Meier methods.  In 
addition, progression date, death date, date of first response,  and last tumor assessment date 
will be listed, together with BOR, TTR, DR, and PFS.

minimum, maximum, geometric mean, its associated CV, and 95% co nfidence interval) by 
dose, cycle, day and nominal time.  Individual patient and medi an profiles of the axitinib 
concentration-time data will be plotted by dose, cycle and day using nominal times.  Median 
axitinib profiles will be presented on both linear-linear and l og-linear scales.
Ctrough and C maxfor avelumab will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, SD, CV,  median, 
minimum, maximum, geometric mean, its associated CV, and 95% co nfidence interval) by 
dose, cycle, and day.  The trough concentrations for avelumab w ill be plotted for each dose 
using a box-whisker plot by cycle and day in order to assess th e attainment of steady-state.
9.5.1.2. Effect of Avelumab on Axitinib Pharmacokinetics 
The effect of repeated avelumab dosing on axitinib PK will be e valuated based on overall 
assessment of the geometric mean ratios for C maxand AUC tauof axitinib on 
Cycle 4 Day 1 (avelumab in combination with axitinib) in relation t o Lead-in Day 7 (axitinib 
alone).  The associated 90% confidence intervals will also be c omputed for the geometric 
mean ratios.
9.5.1.3. Immunogenecity Assessment
For the immunogenicity data, the percentage of patients with pos itive ADA and neutralizing 
antibodies each will be summarized by dose.  For patients with positive ADA, the magnitude 
(titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA response will also be described, if data permit. 
Because the observed incidence of ADA is highly dependent on mu ltiple factors including 
the assays used for ADA detection, timing of sample collection and immune status of the 
patients, the incidence of ADA observed in the planned study ma y differ from the incidence 
reported in historical clinical trials. 
9.5.1.4. Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Avelumab disposition will be evaluated using a population PK mo del for the drug and will be 
reported separately.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 1349.5.1.5. Analysis of Biomarker Endpoints 
Biomarkers will be assessed separately for blood and tumor tiss ue biospecimens.  Summaries 
of baseline levels and, when on-treatment biomarker data is ava ilable, changes from baseline, 
will be reported.  Summary statistics may include the mean and standard deviation, median, 
and minimum/maximum levels of biomarker measures or frequency s tatistics, as appropriate.
Data from biomarker assays will be analyzed using graphical met hods and descriptive 
statistics such as linear regression, t-test, and analysis of v ariance (ANOVA).  The statistical 
approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with pha rmacokinetic parameters 
and measures of anti-tumor efficacy.
  
9.6. Safety Analysis
Summaries and analyses of the primary safety endpoint will be b ased on the per protocol 
analysis set.  All other summaries and analyses of safety parame ters will include all patients 
in the safety analysis set.  Safety data will be summarized by treatment group for all treated 
patients using appropriate tabulations and descriptive statisti cs separately for each phase of 
the study.  Safety data collected during the lead-in PK period will be reported separately.  All 
safety data collected through 90 days after the last administrat ion of study drug will be listed.
9.6.1. Analysis of the Primary Safety Endpoint
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the Dos e Finding Phase of the 
study.  The incidence of DLTs observed in the Dose Finding Phas e is used to estimate the 
MTD (if reached) as described in Section 3.1.1.2 .  Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be 
listed per cohort.
9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints
9.6.2.1. Adverse Events
Adverse events will be classified using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities 
(MedDRA) classification system.  The severity of the toxicities  will be graded according to 
the NCI CTCAE v4.03 whenever possible (http://ctep.info.nih.gov/ reporting/ctc.html).  The 
frequency of patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse e vents corresponding to body 
systems and MedDRA preferred term will be reported.  Adverse ev ents will be graded by 
worst NCI CTCAE v4.03 severity grade, and will be summarized by cycle and by relatedness 
to study treatment. 
Emphasis in the analysis will be placed on AEs classified as tr eatment emergent.  Adverse 
events leading to death or discontinuation of study treatment, events classified as NCI 
CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥3, trial drug-related events, and serious adverse events will b e 
considered with special attention. CCI090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 135Detailed information collected for each AE will include a descr iption of the event, duration, 
whether the AE was serious, intensity, relationship to study tr eatment, action taken, and 
clinical outcome. 
9.6.2.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities
Laboratory test results will be graded according to the NCI CTC AE v4.03 severity grade.  
The frequency of patients with laboratory test abnormalities wi ll be summarized according to 
the worst grade for each laboratory test. 
For laboratory tests without an NCI CTCAE grade definition, resu lts will be categorized as 
normal (within normal ranges), abnormal, or not done.
Shift tables will be provided to examine the distribution of la boratory abnormalities. 
9.6.2.3. Electrocardiograms 
ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate measurements) wi ll be used for the 
statistical analysis and all data presentations.  Any data obta ined from ECGs repeated for 
safety reasons after the nominal time points will not be averag ed along with the preceding 
triplicates.  Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be included in the outlier 
analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained a t unscheduled time points.
QT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using stand ard correction factors 
[ie, Fridericia’s (default correction), Bazett’s, and possibly a  study specific factor, as 
appropriate].  Data will be summarized and listed QT, HR, RR ,PR, QRS, QTc. 
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, min imum, and maximum) will be 
used to summarize the absolute corrected QT interval and change s from baseline in corrected 
QT after treatment.  Categorical analysis will be conducted for  the maximum change from 
baseline in corrected QT and the maximum post-baseline correcte d QT interval. 
Shift tables will be provided for baseline vs worst on treatmen t corrected QT.  Shift tables 
will also be provided for ECG abnormality at baseline vs. on tr eatment.  Patients 
experiencing clinically relevant morphological ECG changes will  be summarized (including 
frequency and percentage).
9.6.3. Concomitant Medications/Follow-up Systemic Therapy 
All medications received during the treatment period will be co nsidered as concomitant 
medications and will be coded by WHO medical dictionary.  Patie nts who received 
concomitant medications will be listed.  Follow-up systemic the rapy for the primary 
diagnosis will be summarized by categories of follow-up therapy  and will be listed for each 
patient as appropriate.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 1369.7. Data Safety Monitoring Committee
An external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be establ ished for the study.  For the 
purpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety  review will be applied by an 
internal safety review team with medical and statistical capabi lities to review individual and 
summary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. 
Periodic safety review procedures will include:
•Surveillance for SAEs according to regulatory guidelines.
•Discussions between the investigators and the sponsor of AEs, l aboratory test 
abnormalities, vital signs, and ECG findings observed at each d ose level in an 
ongoing manner at regular teleconferences and/or meetings to de termine the safety 
profile, make risk/benefit assessments, and decide if further e nrollment is appropriate.  
During the Dose Finding Phase in particular, monitoring and saf ety findings 
satisfying DLT criteria will be discussed in an ongoing manner.  
•Safety findings that have immediate implications for the manage ment of patients on 
study will be communicated to all investigators in the timeframe  associated with 
unexpected and drug-related SAEs.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits dur ing study conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being follo wed.  The monitors may 
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CR Fs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditor s or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to per form this verification.  This 
verification may also occur after study completion.
During study conduct and/or after study completion, the study s ite may be subject to review 
by the institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality assurance 
audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on beh alf of Pfizer, and/or to 
inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.
The investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediatel y of any regulatory inspection 
notification in relation to the study.  Furthermore, the invest igator will cooperate with Pfizer 
or its agents to prepare the study site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The in vestigator will promptly 
provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agen t.  Before response submission 
to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pf izer or its agents with an 
opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such find ings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant per sonnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that s ufficient time is devoted to the 
process.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 13711. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collec tion method used in this study.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included pat ient.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be  made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory 
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection  and reporting of all clinical, 
safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other da ta collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/origi nal, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and ava ilable when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized sta ff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs are true.  Any corrections to entrie s made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary)  and should not obscure the 
original entry. 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the p hysician's patient chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in t hose charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as s ource documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigative site  as well as at Pfizer and clearly 
identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for w hich the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities  or Pfizer, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participa ting patients (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), al l original signed informed 
consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documen tation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls re ports).  The records should be 
retained by the investigator according to International Confere nce on Harmonisation (ICH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreem ent (CSA), whichever is 
longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue t o retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified.  The 
study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to P fizer, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third p arty arranged by Pfizer.  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years afte r completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by appli cable local regulations.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 138The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before  disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12. ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospectiv e approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other rele vant documents, 
eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated pr ior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate h azards to the patients.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regula tory requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical G uidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Or ganizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declarat ion of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association). 
In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the  protocol, the ICH guideline 
on GCP, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.
12.3. Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and  will not include patient names 
or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or oth er disclosures, except where 
required by law. 
When study data are complied for transfer to Pfizer and other a uthorized parties, patient 
names, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical code consisting 
of a numbering system provided by Pfizer in order to de-identif y study patients. The study 
site will maintain a confidential list of patients who particip ated in the study, linking each 
patient’s numerical code to his or her actual identity.   In case of data transfer, Pfizer will 
maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of pa tients’ personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy laws.
The informed consent documents must be in compliance with ICH G CP, local regulatory 
requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable priv acy laws.
The informed consent document(s) used during the informed conse nt process must be 
reviewed and approved by the sponsor, approved by the IRB/EC be fore use, and available for 
inspection.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 139The investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his or  her legally acceptable 
representative (as allowed by local guideline/practice), is ful ly informed about the nature and 
objectives of the study and possible risks associated with part icipation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from patient’s parent(s), legal gu ardian or legally acceptable 
representative, the patient’s assent (affirmative agreement) mu st subsequently be obtained 
when the patient has the capacity to provide assent, as determi ned by the IRB/EC.  If the 
investigator determines that a patient’s decisional capacity is  so limited he/she cannot 
reasonably be consulted, then, as permitted by the IRB/EC and c onsistent with local 
regulatory and legal requirements, the patient’s assent may be waived with source 
documentation of the reason assent was not obtained.  If the st udy patient does not provide 
his or her own consent, the source documents must record why th e patient did not provide 
consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the inves tigator determined that the 
person signing the consent was the patient’s legally acceptable  representative, the consent 
signer’s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent, spouse) , and that the patient’s assent was 
obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally it must be  documented in the source 
documents.
The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, w ill obtain written informed 
consent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable r epresentative before any 
study-specific activity is performed.  The investigator will re tain the original of each patient's 
signed consent document.
12.4. Patient Recruitment
Advertisements approved by IRBs/ECs and investigator databases may be used as 
recruitment procedures.
Pfizer will have an opportunity to review and approve the conte nt of any study recruitment 
materials directed to potential study patients before such mate rials are used.
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Pro tocol or ICH GCP
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, cli nical hold) by an applicable 
competent authority in any area of the world, or if the investi gator is aware of any new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits  and risks of the investigational 
product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of  any urgent safety measures 
taken by the investigator to protect the study patients against  any immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the in vestigator becomes aware of.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 14013. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of trial in a Member State of the European Union (EU) is de fined as the time at which it 
is deemed that a sufficient number of patients have been recrui ted and completed the study as 
stated in the regulatory application (ie, clinical trial applic ation [CTA]) and ethics application 
in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than th e anticipated number in the 
CTA) by a Member State is not a reason for premature terminatio n but is considered a 
normal conclusion to the study in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries
End of Trial in all other participating countries is defined as  Last Patient Last Visit.
14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regu latory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/EC, or investigational product saf ety problems, or at the 
discretion of Pfizer.  In addition, Pfizer retains the right to  discontinue development of 
avelumab alone or in combination with axitinib at any time.
If a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer wi ll promptly notify the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contac t all participating patients and 
the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 1 month.  As direct ed by Pfizer, all study 
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the great est extent possible.

15.2. Publications by Investigators
Pfizer supports the exercise of academic freedom and has no obj ection to publication by 
principal investigator of the results of the study based on inf ormation collected or generated 
by principal investigator, whether or not the results are favor able to the Pfizer product.  
However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of confidenti al information or unprotected 
inventions, the investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity  to review any proposed 
publication or other type of disclosure of the results of the s tudy (collectively, “Publication”) 
before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed.
The investigator will provide any publication to Pfizer at leas t 30 days before they are 
submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed.  If any paten t action is required to protect 
intellectual property rights, the investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to 
exceed an additional 60 days.
The investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisc losed confidential 
information before disclosure, except for any study- or Pfizer p roduct-related information 
necessary to the appropriate scientific presentation or underst anding of the study results.
If the study is part of a multicentre study, the investigator a grees that the first publication is 
to be a joint publication covering all study sites, and that an y subsequent publications by the 
principal investigator will reference that primary publication.   However, if a joint manuscript 
has not been submitted for publication within 12 months of compl etion or termination of the 
study at all participating sites, the investigator is free to p ublish separately, subject to the 
other requirements of this section.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

CATEGORIZING LESIONS AT BASELINE
Measurable Lesions 
•Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimensi on.
•Lesions with longest diameter twice the slice thickness and at least 10 mm or greater 
when assessed by CT or MRI (slice thickness 5-8 mm).
•Lesions with longest diameter at least 20 mm when assessed by Ch est X-ray. 
•Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by caliper. 
•Malignant lymph nodes with the short axis 15 mm or greater when assessed by CT.
NOTE: The shortest axis is used as the diameter for malignant ly mph nodes, longest 
axis for all other measurable lesions. 
Non-Measurable Disease 
Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be conside red measurable (including 
nodes with short axis between 10 and 14.9 mm) and truly non-measu rable disease such as
pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, clinical lesions that  cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers, abdominal masses identified by physical exam tha t are not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.
•Bone disease: Bone disease is non-measurable with the exception  of soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated by CT or MRI and meet the defi nition of 
measurability at baseline. 
•Previous local treatment: A previously irradiated lesion (or le sion subjected to other 
local treatment) is non-measurable unless it has progressed sin ce completion of 
treatment.
Normal Sites
•Cystic lesions: Simple cysts should not be considered as malign ant lesions and should 
not be recorded either as target or non-target disease.  Cystic lesions thought to 
represent cystic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they meet the specific 
definition above.  If non-cystic lesions are also present, thes e are preferred as target 
lesions.090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Final Protocol, Amendment 4, 05 October 2018 
Page 149•Normal nodes: Nodes with short axis <10 mm are considered normal  and should not 
be recorded or followed either as measurable or non-measurable disease.
RECORDING TUMOR ASSESSMENTS 
All sites of disease must be assessed at baseline.  Baseline as sessments should be done as 
close as possible prior to study start.  For an adequate baseli ne assessment, all required scans 
must be done within 28 days prior to treatment and all disease m ust be documented 
appropriately.  If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequen t statuses generally should be 
indeterminate. 
Target Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest  lesions) and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements.  Record the longest diameter fo r each lesion, except in the 
case of pathological lymph nodes for which the short axis shoul d be recorded.  The sum of 
the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for no dal lesions) for all target lesions 
at baseline will be the basis for comparison to assessments per formed on study. 
If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced  mass is used.  If a large target 
lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used.
Measurements for target lesions that become small should contin ue to be recorded.  If a 
target lesion becomes too small to measure, 0 mm should be recor ded if the lesion is 
considered to have disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm  should be recorded.
NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual  measurement 
should still be recorded.
Non-Target Disease 
All non-measurable disease is non-target.  All measurable lesio ns not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non-target disease.  Measurements are not required but rather 
assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMINATE, PRESENT /NOT 
INCREASED, INCREASED.  Multiple non-target lesions in one organ  may be recorded as a 
single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pel vic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple 
liver metastases’).
OBJECTIVE RESPONSE STATUS AT EACH EVALUATION 
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as base line, including consistent 
administration of contrast and timing of scanning.  If a change  needs to be made the case 
must be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitu tion is possible.  If not, 
subsequent objective statuses are indeterminate. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 150Target Disease
•Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target le sions with the 
exception of nodal disease.  All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis 
<10 mm).  All target lesions must be assessed.
•Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease un der baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions.  The short d iameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the  sum for all other target 
lesions.  All target lesions must be assessed. 
•Stable: Does not qualify for CR, PR or Progression.  All target  lesions must be 
assessed.  Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases by less 
than 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documente d 30% decrease no 
longer holds. 
•Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameter s of target 
measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseli ne if no decrease in 
the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute in crease of 5 mm. 
•Indeterminate.  Progression has not been documented, and 
•One or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed; 
or
•Assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at ba seline;
or
•One or more target lesions cannot be measured accurately (eg, p oorly visible 
unless due to being too small to measure);
or
•One or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared or 
increased. 
Non-Target Disease
•CR: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization o f tumor marker 
levels.  All lymph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm short axis).
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of a ny non-target les ions and/or tum or marker level 
above the normal limits. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Page 151•PD: Unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions.  Generally  the overall tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently to merit discontinuation of t herapy.  In the presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal i ncrease in non-target 
disease should be rare. 
•Indeterminate: Progression has not been determined and one or m ore non-target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at 
baseline.
New Lesions 
The appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion indicate s PD.  If a new lesion is 
equivocal, for example due to its small size, continued assessm ent will clarify the etiology.  
If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression shou ld be recorded on the date of 
the initial assessment.  A lesion identified in an area not pre viously scanned will be 
considered a new lesion.
Supplemental Investigations
If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased  in size but did not disappear 
completely, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigat ed with biopsy or fine needle 
aspirate.  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.
If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increa se possibly due to necrosis, 
the lesion may be investigated with biopsy or fine needle aspir ate to clarify status. 
Objective/Subjective Progression
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objecti ve evidence of disease 
progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CR Fs.  This should be 
indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to G lobal Deterioration of Health 
Status.  Every effort should be made to document objective prog ression even after 
discontinuation of treatment. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Determination of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progres sive disease the smallest sum 
on study).  For CR and PR, the patient’s best response assignme nt will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  CR and PR must be confirmed 
by 2 measurements at least 4 weeks apart.  In the case of SD, fol low up measurements must 
have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a m inimum interval of 6 weeks. 090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

Infusion-Related Reactions
The following treatment recommendations for symptoms of aveluma b infusion-related 
reactions may be modified based on local treatment standards an d guidelines, as appropriate.
For Grade 1 Symptoms: (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; interventi on not 
indicated)
•Decrease the avelumab infusi on rate by 50% and mon itor closely f or any worsening 
(the total infusion time for avelumab should not exceed 120 minu tes).
•Remain at bedside, and monitor patient until recovery from symp toms.
For Grade 2 Symptoms: (Moderate reaction; Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines,  NSAIDs, narcotics, IV 
fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for ≤24 hours).
•Stop the avelumab infusion.
•Treat based on emerging symptoms.  Treatment may include:
•Normal saline IV;
•H1 blockers, such as diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV (or equivalent );
•H2 blockers, such as ranitidine 50 mg IV (or equivalent);
•NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen 600 mg (or equivalent);
•Meperidine 12.5 to 50 mg IV;
•Corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone 100 to 500 mg IV (or equi valent);
•Bronchodilators.
•Remain at bedside, and monitor patient until resolution of symp toms.
•Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate as soon as infusion-rel ated reaction has 
resolved or decreased to at least Grade 1 in severity, and monit or closely for any 
recurrence or worsening.
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 Symptoms: (Severe reaction; Grade 3: prolonged [eg, not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicat ed for clinical sequelae 
[eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]; Grade 4: life-thr eatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated).090177e1907c3de0\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:01-Mar-2019 17:22 (GMT )

GENERAL INFORMATION 
Spinal cord injuries lead to a host of primary and secondary physical impairments that 
can interfere with an  individual’s health and participation in life activ ities. Even  with intensive 
rehabilitation many persons affected by spinal cord injury (SCI) will lead sedentary lifestyles. 
Individuals with SCI face a multitude of challenges due to physical difficulties that impact their 
health, independence, and satisfaction with life. With the integration of modern technology 
into rehabilitation, multiple techniques have been developed that combine our knowledge of 
walking with robotic technology.  Further, emerging research indicates that application of 
electrical  stimulation directly to the spinal cord can result in ac tive motor recruitment below 
the level  of injury for individuals with complete SCI.1-2   Non-invasive electrical stimulation, 
transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS), has the ability to alter spinal reflexes 
and modulate  spinal cord excitability in healthy subjects and individuals with SC I.3-17 
Therefore, tsDCS has the potential to modulate and induce spinal cord excitability and 
neuroplasticity that leads to recovery  after SCI.  The purpose of this study is to determine 
whether tsDCS is safe for individuals with SCI.  In specific Aim  1, we will determine whether 
tsDCS is safe for patients with SC I. In specific aim 2, we will investigate the potential 
neurophysiological changes and functional improvem ents in gait for individuals with SCI after 
combined application of tsDCS and exos keleton assisted gait training. We  hypothesize that 
when subjects are receiving the tsDCS in combination with exos keleton training they will 
demonstrate an increased mag nitude in spinal reflex which will correlate with improvem ent in 
gait speed, as compared to when subjects are receiving exos keleton training without tsDCS. 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND  INFORMATION 
As of 2014, there were an estimated 276,000 persons in the United States living with a 
SCI, and an additional 12,500 new cases  added each year.  Of those injured, approximately  66%

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  06/24/2016   presented with incomplete spinal lesions.18 While individuals with motor incomplete lesions 
may  regain  some  ability to ambula te over ground, ambula tion in the community and household 
may  be limited or impossible secondary to the physical demands encountered during gait. This 
contributes to an extremely limited number of steps taken per day, and often leads to a 
sedentary lifestyle.19 It is well appreciated that a sedentary lifestyle from paralysis co ntributes 
to many seco ndary medical problems such as diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis/osteopenia, 
urinary, pulmonary and cardiovasc ular disease.20-23 Walking, therefore, is not only an important 
activity of daily livi ng but also helps to reduce secondary complications. Most importantly, 
recovery  of walking ability is one of the single most predictors of quality of life after spinal cord 
injury.24, 25 
Historically therapy was limited to teaching compensatory strategies,  as little was known 
about neuroplasticity of the spinal cord. Evidence is now growing to support the ability of the 
spinal cord to adapt after injury.26  Emerging research indicates that intentional massed practice 
of ac tivity-based  training may  promote neural plasticity and cortical reorganization and 
subsequent recovery  of walking ability after neurological  injury, including SCI.27-32 Moreover, 
studies have shown that placing the body in a load bearing position and moving the lower  limbs 
in a repetitive stepping pattern leads to improved  loco motor recove ry.33-35   One example, 
loco motor training, using body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT), drives  changes in 
spinal cord pathways by increasing the excitability of the spinal cord leading to recovery  of 
movem ents controlled below the level  of injury.36, 37   In BWSTT, a body weight support system 
allows for unweighting of the body while using a treadmill to provide repetitive stepping. An 
alterna tive method for achieving load bearing, repetitive stepping in an overgr ound 
environment  with less  cost and energy  to clinicians is use of lower  extremity robotic 
exos keletons for gait training. 
In spite of the fact that the spinal cord has shown great potential for neuroplasticity, no 
one interventi on has proven successful at inducing changes in the cord and return of full pre- 
injury function prior to SCI.  It is important to make availa ble in the clinic interventions that 
combine neuroplasticity principles and focus on restoring function after neurological  injury. 
Electrical  stimulation is currently readily avail able and utilized in the clinic for spasticity, pain, 
muscle strengthening and neurological recovery.  Electrical  stimulation can be applied at the 
muscle, nerve  or spinal level.  Exciting new research is demonstrating that application of 
electrical  stimulation directly to the spinal cord can result in ac tive motor recruitment below 
the level  of injury for individuals with complete SCI.1-2 However, this technology  is only avai lable 
in research phase and requires invasive surgery. 
An alterna tive non-invasive method for stimulating the spinal cord is through the use of 
transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS).  tsDCS applies electrical  current to the 
spinal cord via  surface electrodes placed on the skin. It has been demonstrated in animal 
models and healthy human subjects that tsDCS has the ability to alter spinal reflexes  and has an 
effect on spinal cord excitability.3-16 The use of tsDCS has been eva luated in healthy individuals, 
however  there is only one research study to date that investigates the use of tsDCS on 
individuals with SC I.17 Hubli found that individuals with complete SCI demonstrated changes in 
spinal reflexes  after application of tsDCS.17  This means tsDCS has the potential to alter spinal 
cord excitability below the level  of lesion.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  06/24/2016   Although this technology  has been around for decades and tsDCS has been shown to 
modulate the excitability of the spinal cord, limited research has investigated its use in the SCI 
population. Before this technology  could promote recovery  after SCI, further research  is needed 
to eva luate the safety and efficacy of this intervention. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot 
study is to determine whether tsDCS is safe for individuals with SCI.  It is hypothesized that use 
of tsDCS will l ead to measurable changes in spinal excitability (measured by H-reflex in soleus 
muscles) in individuals with SC I. We  further hypothesize that this potential neurophysiological 
change could lead to gait improvemen ts. To answer our questions, we will use exos keleton 
assis ted ga it training as a standard gait training interventi on in combination with tsDCS. 
 
OBJEC TIVES 
The purpose of this study is to determine whether tsDCS is safe for individuals with SCI. 
Specific Aim  1: To determine whether tsDCS is safe for patients with SCI.  There is one 
study that has utilized tsDCS in 17 individuals SCI17.  No adverse events were noted in this study, 
therefore we hypothesize that all subjects will tolerate the use of tsDCS without adverse 
reactions. 
Specific Aim  2: To investigate the potential neurophysiological changes and functional 
improvem ents in gait for individuals with SCI a fter combined application of tsDCS and 
exos keleton assis ted gait training. It has been demonstrated that use of tsDCS has an impact on 
spinal excitability, however  there has been no investigation on the potential impact changes in 
spinal excitability may have on functional mobility. We hypothesize that when subjects are 
receiving the tsDCS in combination with exos keleton training they will demonstrate an 
increased  mag nitude in spinal reflex which will correlate with improvem ent in gait s peed, as 
compared to when subjects are receivi ng exos keleton training without tsDCS.

Screening 
After informed consent is provided, the subject will undergo  a screening evaluation to 
assess s kin integrity, hip, knee, and ankle range of m otion, and spasticity. We will also perform 
assessme nts of functional mobility and measurements to ensure the individual will safely fit 
inside the robotic exos keletons. 
 
Baseline Visits 
Subjects will participate in two baseline visits, 4 days apart. The visit will last 1 hour and 
will include assessm ent of soleus H-Reflex and 10 meter walk test on arrival and 40 minutes 
after initial assessme nt. Subjects will be asked to minimize their activity between assessme nts 
by either sitting in a chair or lying on a mat. 
 
Training Visits 
Each training visit will involve  either an exos keleton intervention or a combined 
exos keleton and tsDCS interventi on. Subjects will participate in a total of 15 training visits.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  06/24/2016   
Exos keleton Interventi on: Each exos keleton intervention will last 20 minutes. During 
the exos keleton training sessio n, subjects will wear Ekso®, a lower  extremity exoskeleton 
robotic walking device. Initial training will focus on static and dynamic standing balance and 
weight shift training with the exos keleton and progress  to more difficult activities such as 
transitioning form sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit, walking, and turning. There will always be at 
least one trainer present during the training sessions to provide varying  levels of assis tance. As 
a subject's skill with the powered exos keleton improves, the need for trainer assistance will be 
proportionately reduced. At the conclusion of 20 minutes of exos keleton gait training, the 
subject will perform a 10 Meter Walk Test. 
Safety: There will always be at least one trainer present during the training sessio ns to 
provide varying  levels  of assis tance. A 2nd staff will stand and walk with the subject if needed to 
ensure safety and prevent falls. Subjects will wear a safety harness attached to an overhead 
body weight support system to prevent  falls if necessary.  
 
tsDCS Intervention: tsDCS interventi ons will last 20 minutes.  S ubjects will be assig ned 
to receive  anode or cathode stimulation.  Direct  current stimulation will be delivered using 
Soterix Medical 2x1s Transcutaneous Spinal Direct Current Stimulator.  Stimulation will be 
provided following published tsDCS protocol7, 17. One el ectrode (50 cm2) will be placed al ong 
center of spine centered over the spinous processes of T10. The reference electrode will be 
placed over  the R shoulder. Direct current intensity will be applied at 2.5 mA (0.05 mA/cm2) 
with a total charge of 60 mC/cm2 for 20 minutes. These stimulation parameters are below the 
known threshold for possible tissue damage38. 
Subjects will participate in individualized training sessio ns at UT Health Motor Recovery  
Laboratory at the NeuroRecovery  Rese arch Center at TIRR Memorial  Hermann.

Outcome  Mea sures 
Subjects will participate in a screening, 2 baseline visits and 15 intervention visits. 
Outcome  measures that will occur at baseline and during intervention visits and will include 
spinal reflex testing using the Hoffman Re flex (H-Reflex) and 10 Meter Walk Test  (10MWT). 
Assessments: 
 Soleus H-reflexes:  H-reflex will be elicited by placing the cathode of an el ectrical 
stimulator in the popliteal fossa and stimulating N. tibialis.  Surface electromyogra phy 
electrodes will be placed at  the soleus muscle of the testing leg to record the electrical- 
induced muscle activity. At the beginning of the test, stimulus thresholds and maximal 
amplitudes of H-responses (Hmax) a nd M-responses (Mmax)  will be asse ssed. The 
stimulus intensity applied to elic it H-reflexes  will be chosen  just below stimulus intensity 
required to elicit Hmax,  i.e. 0.9 times.  The size of each H-reflex will be measured as the 
peak-to-peak amplitude of the non-rectified EMG trace  (Figure 2). H-reflex mag nitude 
will be normalized by expressing  it as a percen tage of the amplitude of Mmax.

 10 Meter Walk  Test (10MWT): The 10MWT will assess  subject’s gait s peed.  Four marks 
will be placed on  the ground at 0, 2, 12 and 14 meters. Subjects will walk a total of 14 
meters. The middle 10 meters (between marks at 2 and 12 meters) will be timed and 
recorded as their gait speed. Subjects will perform a 10MWT without use of 
exos keleton. 
  Exos keleton user feedback: A questionnaire will be administered to allow participants 
to provide feedback regarding their experience after completion of treatment sessio ns. 
 
Treatment sessions: We will track  any signs of adverse  reaction to the tsDCS intervention such 
as skin irritation, complaints of pain or  discomfort continuously throughout subject’s 
participation. 
 
Tentative Timeline The proposed timeline to complete the study is 2 years. 
 
PHO TOGRAPHY and VIDEOTA PING 
We would like to obtain photographs and video during the tsDCS and exos keleton 
treatment  sessi ons. The goal  of the photography and videotaping will be used for educational

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  06/24/2016   purposes  when presenting results of this study. The photographs will be used to demonstrate 
application of tsDCS and what exos keleton training looks like. The identity of subjects will not 
be revealed in the photograph. If a photograph or video is used, a black box will be placed in 
front of subject’s face to protect their identity. Any photographs and videos taken during the 
study will be saved on a  locked computer in a file labeled with the subject’s resear ch number 
and no other identifying information. These files will be sav ed for five years after which they 
will be deleted. 
 
DATA and SAFETY MONITORING 
We will use followi ng strategies  to prevent some  expected events for this study: 
1)   Loss  of confidentiality or privacy  
Information obtained for this study will be kept private to the extent allowed by law. However, 
research information may be shared with the Universi ty of Texas  Health Science Center at 
Houston Institutional Review  Board  (IRB), the research physician investigator, the research  staff 
and others who are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to 
research. 
The study will be performed  at UT Health Motor Recovery  Laboratory at the TIRR 
NeuroRecovery  Rese arch Center. 
Data will be collec ted on paper forms  which will be kept in a locked room in a locked filing 
cabinet in the research office. To allow for data analysi s, data will be de-identified and entered 
into an ex cel spreadsheet. All computers are password protected and therefore, only 
authorized persons have the access to the electronic files saved  in computers and will adhere to 
TIRR Memorial  Hermann standards. 
2)   Loss  of saved  electronic data after a computer crash 
All origi nal data will be maintained on paper data collec tion forms.  De-identified data may  be 
entered into computer for data analysi s.  A standard procedure of el ectronic file backup is 
established and enforced by the PI. All file backups are routinely performed in the local  hard 
drive.  
However, if there are other unanticipated problems which occur during and after data 
collec tion: the origi nal paper version of the data will be maintained in the locked file cabinet. 
3)   Loss  of balance or fall from testing 
One r esearch team member will remain next to the subject as long as the subject is donned in 
the exos keleton robot to prevent loss of balance or fall whether sitting or standing. If a fall or 
significant loss of balance occurs, one staff physician will be notified immediately. All adverse 
events will be reported per CP HS protocol. 
4)   Possible  skin irr itation 
Local  skin irr itation, bruising, swelling, or temporary discomfort following wearing of the 
exos keleton and/or post tsDCS intervention may  occur. Prior to tsDCS application and donning 
the exos keleton subject’s skin will be inspected by a licensed Physical Therapist for baseline, 
and compared after tsDCS interventi on and doffing exos keleton. Any differences will be 
recorded and followed up with the study physician ac cordingly.  All adverse events  will be 
reported per CP HS protocol. 
5)   Bone Fracture

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  06/24/2016   The risk of fracture to the subject is no greater with the use of exos keleton than conventional 
weight bearing and walking therapy. 
 
 
 
STATISTICS 
Descri ptive statistical analysis will be performed to exami ne the trend of the outcome 
measures at baseline, interve ntion and combined intervention for each case study series. 
 
ETHICS   
 
The study will be performed  under the prevue and in accordance with the rules set by 
the Commi ttee for the Protection of Human S ubjects (UT IRB). Potential subjects will be 
identified by physiatrists working in the outpatient clinic and/or on the inpatient wards at The 
Institute for Re habilitation and Rese arch (TIRR) Memorial  Hermann. Once identified, the 
potential subjects will be approached and asked if they wish to discuss a study utilizing 
electrical  stimulation and exos keletons (Robotic suits worn on the outside of the body) for 
individuals with spinal cord injury. It will also be explained that choosing not to inquire further 
about the study will in no way jeopardize the relationship with anyone at TIRR or in the 
Memorial  Hermann system. Once the potential subject agre es he/she will be introduced to 
either the Principal Investigator or the Co-Inves tigator. Once the potential subject agre es to 
discuss the study, the individual and anyone that the potential subject wishes to accompany 
him/her will go into a private room to discuss the contents of the consent form with either the 
Principal Inves tigator or the Co-Inve stigator. After the consent is reviewed  in its entirety, and 
after allowing ample time for questions, either the Principal Investigator or the Co-Investigator 
will give the potential subject time to discuss the study with whomev er the potential subject 
cares to discuss the study with. If the subject agrees to enroll in the study, the Principal 
Inves tigator or Co-Investigator will review  the informed consent form with the subject in its 
entirety. 
 
DATA HANDLING  and RECORD KEEPING 
The subject’s name  and demogr aphic informa tion will be collected prior to testing. Each 
subject will be assig ned an identification number which will be used from this point forward. All 
measurements will be stored according to the identification number. All research materials will 
be kept in a locked file cabinet in the research office. All computers are password protected 
and only authorized persons have the access to the electronic files saved in computers. Paper 
data will be stored in the UT  Health Motor Recovery Laboratory research office in a locked file 
cabinet. Access to the file cabinet will be given  to the Primary Investigator and authorized team 
members. All electronic data stored on the hard drive of the desktop machine will be password 
protected and available only to the authorized research team members. Identifiable data will 
be stored for 5 years  after the study is completed. Stored files will be deleted from the portable 
hard drive after 5 years  as well. Identifiable data will be shredded at the end of 5 years  after the 
completion of the study.

Test product: Fibrinogen (human), thrombin (human), aprotinin (synthetic), and calcium chloride.  
Control device: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) ester solution, and trilysine amine solution.  
Study Title:  
A Randomised Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Fibrin Sealant, Vapour Heated, Solvent/Detergent Treated ( FS VH S/D 500 s- apr) Compared to DuraSeal Dural Sealant as an Adjunct to 
Sutured Dural Repair in Cranial Surgery.  
Study Number:  
3599- 001 
Study Phase:  Phase 3  
Primary Objective:   
To evaluate the efficacy of FS  VH S/D 500 s- apr compared to DuraSeal D ural Sealant as an adjunct to 
sutured dural closure.  
Secondary Objective:  
To evaluate the safety of FS  VH S/D 500 s- apr compared to DuraSeal Dural Sealant as an adjunct to 
sutured dural closure .  
Study Design:  
This study is a Phase  3, prospective, contro lled, randomised, single -blind (patient), multicenter study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of FS  VH S/D 500 s- apr compared to DuraSeal Dural Sealant as an 
adjunct to sutured dural closure in a total of 202 evaluable patients undergoing elective cranial surgery for the treatment of a pathological condition (eg, benign/malignant tumours, vascular malformations, or 
Chiari type  1 malformations) specifically located in the posterior fossa (PF) or supratentorial (ST) 
regions.  
Eligible patients will sign an i nformed consent (IC), and undergo elective cranial surgery of the PF or ST 
region with either craniotomy or craniectomy with planned durotomy. During the surgery, the patients 
will be evaluated according to intra -operative inclusion/exclusion criteria for further eligibility. If 
eligible, the patients will be evaluated upon completion of the primary suturing of the dura (with or 
without non- autologous duraplasty or autologous tissue) . Only if intra -operative cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) leak is confirmed (spontaneous CSF leak or CSF leak after Valsalva manoeuvre; 25  cm H
2O for 
up to 5 - 10 seconds), the patient will be randomised to treatment with either FS  VH S/D 500 s- apr or 
DuraSeal Dural Sealant (control) in a 1:1 allocation ratio stratified by center and s urgical regions ( PF or 
ST). After treatment, a final assessment for intra -operative CSF leak (spontaneous CSF leak or CSF leak 
after Valsalva manoeuvre) will be conducted to evaluate the intra- operative watertight dura closure.  
Two applications of the stu dy products are allowed. In the event that 2  applications are used, the 
Valsalva manoeuvre must be repeated. In the case of continuous intra- operative CSF leak at the final 
assessment, a rescue therapy for sealing any CSF leaks may be applied according to the surgeon’s 
choice/institutional practice (eg, other fibrin sealants [FSs] except FS  VH S/D 500 s- apr or DuraSeal 
Dural Sealant).  
Study Population:   
Approximately 476 patients will be screened in order to randomise approximately 224 patients (with a 
minimal number of 56 PF procedures) and have 202 evaluable patients age ≥18  years, both genders, to 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 4 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  undergo elective craniotomy/craniectomy for pathologica l processes in the PF or ST region (eg, benign 
or malignant tumours, vascular malformation, or Chiari type 1 malformations) and who were 
demonstrated to have persistent CSF leakage following the completion of primary closure of the dural 
incision will be e nrolled in this study.  
The study will be conducted in 4 countries (United States, Spain, Germany, and Czech Republic). 
Additional countries may be involved in the trial.  
Test Product and Dose:   
FS VH S/D 500 s -apr frozen 4 mL syringe  
Mode of administration:  
FS VH S/D 500 s- apr will be applied to the sutured dural line on a dry surface. Two applications will be 
allowed in order to obtain watertight sealing of suture line.  
The neurosurgical procedures will be performed according to the standard practices applicable to each 
indication. The dura will be closed with suture types and needle sizes according to the surgeon’s preference. Special care will be taken to ensure that if tenting sutures are used, they do not perforate the dura. Patients having gaps/defects between dura edges that are >2  mm after primary suturing will be 
excluded due to the limitations of FS VH S/D 500 s- apr. 
FS VH S/D 500 s- apr will be prepared according to the protocol and applied in a thin layer with 5  mm 
on each side of the suture line ensuring that all suture holes are covered.  
Approximately 2 mL of FS  VH S/D 500 s- apr will be used to cover a suture line 10  cm long and 1  cm 
wide (10 cm
2), as per the package insert. After application of FS  VH S/D 500 s- apr, the su rgeon will 
wait 3  minutes before testing for CSF leak in order to achieve sufficient polymerization.  
In the control group, DuraSeal Dural Sealant will be prepared and applied according to the instructions in the protocol appendix.  
Duration of Treatment:   
The patient’s continuation in the clinical study is defined at randomisation and ends upon completion of the scheduled final Follow -up visit on post -operative Day  60 (±3 days). According to clinical 
experience, the incidence of CSF leaks are rare, however when they do occur the majority are detected within 60  days. Therefore, the follow -up period is deemed appropriate. The period between enrolment 
(i.e., signed IC) and surgery will not exceed 30  days; screening procedure results are valid for 30  days. 
After  30 days, the laboratory tests, the review of systems, and the physical examination must be 
repeated. Post -operative follow -up visits are scheduled to take place on the day before discharge or on 
post-operative Day  5 (±2 days), whichever is first, on post -operative Day  30 (±3 days), and on 
post-operative Day  60 (±3 days) ( last study visit), and safety evaluations will be recorded during this 
time period including post -operative CSF leaks (clinical observation, diagnostic testing, or need for 
surgical interv ention to treat CSF leak or pseudomeningocele) . 
Assessments:  
Primary efficacy assessments  
The primary assessment is the proportion of patients who have neither of the following:  
Intra -operative CSF leakage from dural repair after up to two FS  VH S/D 500 s- apr/control applications 
during Valsalva manoeuvre (25 cm H2O for up to 5 - 10 seconds)  
Post-operative CSF leakage within 30 (+3) days post -operatively  
Secondary efficacy assessments  
• Incidence of intra- operative CSF leakage following final Valsalva manoeuvre  
• Incidence of CSF leaks within 30  (+3) days post -operatively  
• Time in surgery (minutes)  
• Time from dural closure (application of investigational product) until end of surgery  
• Length of stay in hospital (days)  

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 5 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  Safety Assessments:  
• Incidence of CSF l eaks within 60  (+3) days post -operatively  
• Incidence of adverse events (AEs) up to 60 (+3) days post -operatively  
• Incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) according to the United States (US) National 
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) within 30  (+3) days p ost-operatively  
• Number of unplanned interventions within 30 (+3) days post -operatively  
• Abnormal laboratory values and vital signs (e.g., elevated white blood cell [WBC] count, fever [temperature >100.7°F or 38.2°C], tachycardia [pulse >100], hypotension [ mean arterial pressure 
<60] ) 
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Calculation:  
In this non- inferiority (NI) study, the proportions of patients meeting the composite primary endpoint are 
assumed to be % for FS VH S/D 500 s -apr and % for DuraSeal Dural Sealant; the NI margin is 
defined as 10%, the 1 -sided Type 1 error rate (α) is  2.5%, the statistical power (1 -β) is 80%. One interim 
analysis after 50% of patients complete the study is assumed, resulting in an overall sample size of 
202 evaluable patients. To reach this number, 112 patients will be randomised to each treatment grou p 
(ie, 224 total patients)  
Planned Statistical Analysis:  
Primary efficacy endpoint analysis:  
The primary composite efficacy endpoint, proportion of patients not meeting the 2 criteria (ie, no intra-operative CSF leakage and no post -operative CSF leakage) , will be investigated by a 2 -sided test 
for non- inferiority using logistic regression, taking into account the following covariates: study center 
and surgery region. Non -inferiority of FS VH S/D 500 s -apr to DuraSeal Dural Sealant will be assessed 
using t he confidence interval approach and a NI margin of 10%.  
Secondary efficacy endpoint analyses:  
The logistic regression approach used for the primary efficacy endpoint will also be used to calculate the proportions of: incidence of intra -operative CSF leakage following final Valsalva manoeuver and the 
incidence of CSF leaks within 30  (+3).  
The time in surgery, time from dural closure until the end of surgery, and the length of stay in hospital will be compared between the 2 treatment groups using a Wilcoxon  rank sum test.    
Safety endpoint analyses:  
The logistic regression approach used for the primary endpoint will also be used to calculate the proportions of: incidence of CSF leaks within 60 (±3) days post -operatively, and incidence of SSIs 
according to NH SN within 30  (±3) days post -operatively.  
The number of unplanned interventions within 30  (±3) days post -operatively will be compared between 
the 2 treatment groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
Listings will be prepared for laboratory results and vital  signs.

  1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
In neurosurgery, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks where disruption of the arachnoid and 
the dura mater allows CSF to flow to an extradural space, is an event which may lead to severe complications, such as infection, pseudomeningocele, and delayed 
pneumocephalus. Closure of the dura serves as a mechanical and a biological barrier to both CSF leaks and to the potential entrance of infectious organisms. Reported incidences of post-operative CSF leaks may vary on average from 0.8 to 13%, depending on the type 
of surgery and other factors. Craniotomy and craniectomy in the posterior fossa (PF) region may have post- operative CSF leaks ranging from 2 % to 11.5%, respectively .
1-4 
Cerebrospinal fluid leak rates are reported to be lower in the supratentorial (ST) region 
(6.3%) and during smaller trans-sphenoidal procedures (6.8%), but are much higher in 
infratentorial procedures and extensive skull base procedures (12.8% and 34.6%, respectively) .

Persisting CSF leaks may result in post-operative meningitis in about 3.1% of interventions with a mean onset of 12 days after surgery.
6 The relative risk (RR) for 
developing meningitis in patients with post-operative CSF leak is increased to a RR = 10.
6 
Also, the risk of surgical site infections (SSI s) is increased in patients with a 
post-operative CSF leak with an odds ratio (OR) for SSI of 3.5 (95% CI 1.4 - 8.5), leading to increased length of stay in the hospital.
7 Risk factors for CSF leaks after 
545 cranial surgeries were surgery in the PF region, opened pneumatised spaces, age, size 
of craniotomy, craniectomies, large remaining dural defects, wound closure without using muscle sutures, and suture techniques .
8 Post-operative CSF leaks will, in most ca ses, 
eventually cease spontaneously  or will heal under conservative management including 
lumbar drainage or with medical treatment to lower the intracranial pressure (ICP). Patients who do not respond to conservative/medical treatment may require surgical 
revision to close the persisting CSF leak, introducing discomfort to the patient and increased overall costs. In fact, neurosurgical procedures with CSF leaks in 1 study increased costs by 141% over procedures that did not have CSF leaks .
5 
The first attempt to treat and control CSF leaks is done by the neurosurgeon at the end of the surgical intervention when the dural edges are to be closed. The goa l is a watertight 
closure of the dura. Defects or large dural gaps might require use of different patches/grafts such as autograft, allograft, xenograft, or synthetic grafts.
9-16 If the dura 
edges can be met, meticulous suturing of the dura is important to gain a watertight 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 14 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
 closure and suturing is considered standard of care by neurosurgeons. However, with 
increased I CP, CSF may leak through even small suture holes in the dura, causing a 
persisting CSF leak often already detected during surgery. Regardless of how meticulously dura suturing is performed, intra-operative CSF leakage has been shown to persist in most patients at a CSF opening pressure >20 cm H
2O.17 A pressure of 20 cm 
H2O (equal to 10 - 15 mm Hg) is considered the upper limit of a physiological ICP a nd 
can easily be exceeded at times (eg, coughing) and can be increased during surgery using the Valsalva manoeuvre.
18 
To minimize the risk of intra -operative CSF leaks and to potentially reduce 
post-operative CSF leak rates, different techniques and materials have been used in conjunction to sutures to provide a watertight sealing of the dural incision; one such treatment modality is the use of a fibrin sealant (FS) directly on the suture line to seal the 
suture holes, as well as the approximated dural edge (as long as the gap is <2 mm wide) . 
9-16 Fibrin sealants consist of a group of compounds with 2 main active 
ingredients, fibrinogen and thrombin, that, when mixed , form a fibrin clot. Fibrin sealants 
applied to tissue during surgery have 4 main functions: haemostasis, tissue sealing, tissue 
adhesion, and wound healing .19 These FSs may be in liquid form (eg, Tisseel, Tissucol) 
or as a part of a dry patch .20  
The FS that has been available for the longest time to clinicians in both Europe (since 1978) and the United States (US; since 1998) is Tisseel (Fibrin Sealant, Vapour Heated, Solvent/Detergent Treated 500 synthetic aprotinin [ FS VH S/ D 500 s-apr], B axter 
Healthcare Corporation [Baxter], Deerfield, IL, US). Several generations of FSs up to the current product FS VH S/D 500 s-apr have been developed, mainly focusing on improving the viral safety and handling properties of the product. Thus, the latest FS generation FS VH S/D 500 s-apr comprises 2 dedicated virus inactivation steps (ie, vapour heat [VH] treatment and solvent/detergent [ S/D] treatment), in the manufacture of 
both human plasma-derived product components (fibrinogen and thrombin component). Vapour heat  is effective in inactivation of lipid -enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lipid-enveloped double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid viruses such as pseudorabies virus, and non-enveloped RNA viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), while S/D treatment is effective against lipid-enveloped RNA and deoxyribonucleic acid  viruses, for example hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The main indications for use in the European Union 
(EU) as supportive treatment adjunct to standard surgical techniques are to improve haemostasis, to improve wound healing, and to support sutures in vascular surgery and gastrointestinal anastomoses and for tissue sealing .

 1.2 Description of Investigational Product 
The Investigational Product (IP) for this protocol is FS VH S/D 500 s-apr in its frozen 
presentation. 
FS VH S/D 500 s -apr is a 2 -component FS made from pooled human plasma. When 
combined, the 2 components, fibrinogen (human) and thrombin (human), mimic the final 
stage of the blood coagulation cascade.  
Fibrinogen (human) is a sterile, non- pyrogenic, VH - and S/D-treated preparation made 
from pooled human plasma. It is provided as a frozen solution pre-filled into 1 side of a dual- chambered syringe (eg , Advanced S yringe Technology [AST] ). The main active 
ingredient in the fibrinogen component is human fibrinogen ( as clottable protein 
91 mg/mL ) contained in a total protein concentration of 96 - 125 mg/mL .
19 A fibrinolysis 
inhibitor, aprotinin (synthetic, 3000 KIU1/mL), is included in the fibrinogen component 
to delay fibrinolysis. Other ingredients include: human albumin, L-histidine, niacinamide, sodium citrate dihydrate, polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) (0.6 - 1.9 mg/mL), and water for 
injection s. 
Thrombin (human) is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, VH- and S/D- treated preparation made 
from pooled human plasma. It is provided as a frozen solution pre-filled into 1 side of a dual- chambered syringe ( eg, AST). The  thrombin component contains the clotting 
activator thrombin (human, 500 IU
2/mL) and calcium chloride (40  μmol/mL). Other 
ingredients are: human albumin, sodium chloride, and water for injection s.  
FS VH S/D 500 s -apr contains plasminogen, fibronectin, and factor XIII  as 
process -related substances. In some countries, factor XIII is classified as an active 
ingredient. 
The use of FS VH S/D 500 s-apr is only topical (application by drip) to cover the dura 
suture line in order to work as a sealant.  
A detailed description of the study product is provided in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC )19 of the Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP) and the US 
Prescribing Information.20  
1 1 EPU (European Pharmacopoeia Unit) corresponds to 1800 KIU (Kallidinogenase Inactivator Unit) . 
2 Thrombin activity is determined using the current WHO Standard for thrombin.

 1.2.1 Approved Therapeutic Indications 
In the EU MRP, according to the SmPC,19 FS
 VH S/D 500 s-apr is approved for 
supportive tr
eatment where standard surgical techniques appear insufficient:  
•For improvement of haemostasis.
•As a tissue glue to improve wound healing or to support sutures in vascular
surgery and in gastrointestinal anastomoses.
•For tissue sealing, to improve adhesion of the separated tissue (e.g., tissue flaps,grafts, split skin grafts [mesh grafts]).
The efficacy in fully heparinised 
patients has been proven. 
In the US, according to the prescribing information ,20 the therapeutic indications for 
FS
 VH S
/D 500  s-apr are: 
•For use as an adjunct to hemostasis in adult and pediatric patients (>1 month of
age) undergoing surgery when control of bleeding by conventional surgicaltechniques (such as suture, ligature, and cautery) is ineffective or impractical.FS VH S/D 500 s -apr is effective in heparinised  patients.
•As a FS indicated as an adjunct to standard surgical techniques (such as suture
and ligature) to prevent leakage from colonic anastomoses following the reversalof temporary colostomies.
1.2.2 C
ontrai
ndications 
Known hypersensitivity to any constituents of the product, including aprotinin.21 
1.3 Clinical Condition/Indication  
In this protocol, FS VH S/D 500 s-apr is intended to be used as an adjunct to sutured 
dural repair in cranial surgery  in patients undergoing elective cranial surgery for the 
treatment of a pathological condition (eg, benign/malignant tumours, vascular malformations, or Chiari type 1 malformations) specifically located in the PF  or ST 
regions. 
1.4 Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the IP to Humans 
The efficacy and safety of Baxter’s FSs have also been demonstrated in post- marketing 
experience, as Baxter’s FSs have been commerciali sed for more than 30 years (also for 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 17 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
 neurosurgery indication in many countries), with a positive benefit-risk balance, which is 
documented in periodic benefit-risk evaluation reports according to EU and US 
regulations. No safety signal has been identified from the reports on use in neurosurgical procedures  in the EU; note that there is no neurosurgical procedure indication in the 
US.
20 
In this clinical trial, the product will be used according to this protocol and to the specifications outlined in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) to minimize any risks. 
No increased adverse event ( AE) risk has been identified over control treatments in the 
previous clinical trials conducted with the IP.
 22 For general information about safety of 
plasma -derived products, please see the IB. With correct handling and application 
technique of the IP, as described in this protocol and in the IB, the anticipated risks to the patients in this clinical trial are expected to be minimal. The expected benefit of the IP is to provide watertight CSF closure to the suture line and potentially reduce complications 
for the patients due to CSF leaks after the surgical intervention.
23,24 These anticipated 
benefits seem to outweigh the potential and minimal risks associated with the use of the 
IP (see the IB for additional details) .

 3. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN
3.1 Overall St udy Design and Plan  
This study is a Phase 3, prospective, controlle d, randomised, single-blind (patient), 
multicente
r study to evaluat e the safety and efficacy of FS VH S/D 500 s- apr c ompared 
to DuraSeal D ural S ealant a s an adjunct to suture d dural closure in a total of 
202 e val
uable patients unde rgoing elective  cranial s urgery f or the  treatment  of a 
pa
thological condition (i.e.,  benign/malignant tumour s, vascular malformations, or Chiari 
type 1 malformations) speci fically located in the PF or ST region.  
Eligibility a ccording to genera l and intra-operative c riter ia will lead to the  final selection  
of the patient into t
he study, which is determined by the presence of  an intra-operative 
CSF 
leak after pr imary dura l closur e with sut ures. Upon detection of CSF leak, the 
patient ’s randomisation assignment to either IP (FS VH S/D 500 s-apr) or to control 
(DuraSeal D ural S ealant) s tratified b y center and sur gical regions (PF or ST) will be  
applied. 
3.2 Overall Study Design 
Patients w ho are ≥ 18 years of age who sign the informed consent (IC) and who meet all 
pre-operative  inclusion/exclusion  criter ia will undergo e lective  cr anial surgery w ith either  
craniotomy
 or craniectomy w ith planned durotomy . Their e ligibility f or surger y will be 
evaluated on the basis of the routine medical work-up (medical history, physical 
examination/review of systems, laboratory, imaging) and of the screening results for 
general inclusion an d exclusion criteria (Section 4.2) during the ≤ 30-day period prior to 
surgery. 
For a schematic di agram of intr a-operative study  design , see Figure 1. During surgery 
(Day 0), p atients will be evaluated according to intra-operative inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for 
further eligibility (Section 4.3); if eligible, patients will be evaluated upon 
completion of the primary suturing of the dura. Only if an intra-operative CSF leak i s 
observe
d (spontaneous CSF leak or CSF leak af ter V alsalva manoeuvre; 25 cm H 2O for  
up to 5 - 10 sec
onds), the patient’s randomisation assignment to 1 of 2 treatments – r epair 
with F S VH S/D 500 s- apr or DuraSeal Dural S ealant  as an adjunct to dural clos ure – w ill 
be applied.  Patients w ith no intr a-operative CSF le a k will not be  enr olled in the  trial ( ie, 
define
d as s creen f ailures).

3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
 The only clinical study data for FS VH S/D 500 s- apr is from  a small r andomis ed 
cont
rolled tr ial (RCT) pi lot st udy (N = 62) conducted by Baxter, where 
FS VH S /D 500 s-apr was used to aug ment the closure of a dura defect by suturing in a 
patch of autologous fascia, pericranium or suturable collagen-based dura substitute, 
which w as the standard o f care. The primary endp oint wa s the incidence of post-operative 
CSF leak at 33 days post-ope ratively . The results demonstrated no disadvantage with 
adding F S VH S/D 500  s-apr to the standard of care;  safety w as also shown to be 
comparable to s tandard of care. During t his study, cranial s urgery w as specifically l ocated 
in the PF re
gion. C SF leakage after pr imar y dur a sutures w as ex clude d. It is important to 
note that though the results demonstrated no disadvantage using FS VH S/D 500 s- apr as 
a sealant, 
the stud y was very small and likely unde rpowered to demonstrate any 
superiority effect; thus the study was considered inconclusive. However, 
FS VH S /D 500 s-apr was demonstr ated to be safe for neurosurgery. 
Recent ly, a large (n = 139) and well -powered RCT was conduc ted. The RCT eva luated a 
similar FS product, containing the same main active ingredients (fibri nogen and 
thrombin) as FS VH S/D 500 s-apr; this study proved superiority of another FS over the 
control treatment (sutures only) in providing a watertight dural closure during surgery .26 
The safety p rofile was comparable in t he 2 groups  and, w ith thi s tria l, an indication for 
“sut
ure 
line sealing i n dura mater closur e” was obt ained i n the EU . 
Bax
ter be lieves that FS VH S/D 500  s-apr will perform equivalently to th e DuraSeal 
Dural S ealant  when use d as an adjunct to suturi ng during surgery . While ot her c linica l 
desig
ns were discussed,  the d esign chos en seems appropr iate, as it provides a reasonably 
accurate reflection  of the typical us age of  FS in  clinical pr actice.   
3.4 Study Duration and Dates 
The overall duration of the study is expected to be 26 months from study initiation  (ie, 
fir
st patient enrolled)  to study c ompletion  (ie,  last patient last visit). T he recruitment 
period i
s expected to be 24 months.  
The patient participati on period i s from pre-operative s cree ning to Day 60 ( ±3 days) after 
surgery (ie, last study visit), unless prematurely discontinued.  
Day of surgery is defined as Day 0. Scheduled Follow-up visits (Appendix 1 ) will take 
place on  the day be fore d ischarge or on Day 5 ( ±2 days) , whichever is first, D ay 30 
(±3 days) , and on Day 60 (±3 da ys) a fter s urgery ( last study  visit) . Follow -up vi sits will 
be adva nced if complications occur prior to the scheduled date. A ccording to clinical

 experience, t he incidence of  CSF leaks are rare, ho wever w hen t hey do  occur t he majority 
are detected within 60 days. Therefore, the follow-up period is deemed appropriate. 
Patients ar
e strongly encouraged to contact or visit the study site without delay to discuss 
a perceived A E that oc curs af ter the first Follow -up vi sit and between the scheduled 
Follow-up visits, and to follow the directives of the study site for appropriate action 
(Unscheduled Follow-up visit assessments, see Appendix 1).

4.4 R emoval of
 Patients from  Therapy, Assessment, or Study  
Any patient may voluntarily withdraw (ie, reduce the degree of participation in the study) 
consent for continued participation and data collection. The reason for withdrawal will be recorded on the End of Study electronic case report form (eCRF). Assessments to be performed at the termination visit (including in cases of withd rawal  or discontinuation) 
are described in Section  6.16 and Section  7.6.  

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 26 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  Discontinuation (ie, complete withdrawal from study participation) may be due to drop 
out (ie, active discontinuation by patient) or los s to follow-up (ie, discontinuation by 
patient withou t notice or action). Additionally, the investigator and the sponsor have the 
discretion to discontinue any patient from the study if, in their judg ment , continued 
participation would pose an unacceptable risk for the patient.  
The data safety monitoring board (DSMB ) will upgrade an AE to a serious adverse event 
(SAE) if the AE results in a patient injury that: jeopardizes the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention, prolongs the hospitalization, requires intervention to prevent permanent im pairment or damage, causes disability or permanent damage, causes 
a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is life -threatening, or results in death.  
The study enrolment will be paused and re- evaluated by the DSMB if:  
• 2 or more SAEs occur in the same patient and are directly related to the 
investigational product, across 10 patients, or   
• 20 aggregate SAEs occur that are directly related to the investigational product, or   
• 1 patient death occurs that is directly related to administration of the investigational product. 
 
The DSMB is required to define the rule(s) appropriate to restart the study, if the above 
triggering events occur during study conduct. 
Discontinuation may also be due to the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) or Competent Authority ’s decision to terminate or suspend 
approval of the study or the i nvestigator .

in the randomised study population. Randomisation w ill be  controlled vi a an int eractive  
Web-
response system ( IWRS) ,  using  dynamic allocation. O n the day 
of surgery (Day 0) , upon confirmation of pre-operative  eligibility criteria, a me mbe r of 
the 
site study 
staff ot her than the  surgeon  will obta in a tr eatment assignment from the  
IWRS . Adequate amounts of FS VH S /D 500 s -apr and D uraSeal  Dural S ealant  will be  
taken i
nto the operating room for potential use as the study treatment. 
Immediately after t he patient ’s intra-operative  eligibility f or study tr eatment has be en 
confirmed ( ie, spontaneous  CSF leak or  CS F leak after V als alva mano euvre), the 
assigned t reatment  will be revealed t o the surgeon and the assi gned IP or control will be  
appl
ied to the CSF l eak site. Following surgery , the treatment assignment and the actual 
treatment  appl ied w ill be  entered i n the eCRF f or the  patient . 
If the pat
ient’s eligibility is not  confirmed  intra-operatively, the operation will be 
performe d according to hospital standards. T he study s ite de signee w ill docum ent the  
noncompliant criterion or criteria plus the date and reason(s) for the patient’s exclusion in 
the eCRF, and a n entry will be made in the I W RS tha t the study tr eatment was not  
admini
stered.  
Details of  the IWRS and  its us e will be  descr ibed i n a separat e IWRS i nst ruction  manual 
that will 
be maintained in the  trial ma ster f ile and in each center’s inve stiga tor trial file.  
5.3 Description  of Treatments 
5.3.1 Investigational Product 
FS VH S/D 500 s -apr is to be applied with cannula b y dripping in a thin and continuous 
layer with a 5 mm overlap on each side of the sutured line, ensuring that all suture holes 
are covered (Appendix 6). 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 28 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
 5.3.2 Control 
The DuraSeal Dural Sealant is to be applied with the DuraSeal System Applicator  by 
spraying a thin (1 – 2  mm) coating, ensuring that all suture holes are covered (Appendix 
7). 
5.3.3 Valsalva Manoeuvre 
The Valsalva manoeuvre i s to be performed b y the anaesthesiologist t o increase the 
intra-thoracic pressure (eg, b y increasing t he positive end- expiratory pressure or by 
giving a large tidal volume and hold the inflating pressure) to approximately 25 c m H 2O 
constant
ly for up to 5 - 10 seconds  to transiently e levate the ICP and test for an y  CSF 
leaks.
 
5.3.4 Antibiotic Prophylaxis 
All patients , regardless o f treatment  arm, will ha ve pe ri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis, 
according t o the guidelines at ea ch site.  
5.3.5 Rescue Therapy 
In case o f continuous  CSF leak in s pite of  tr eatment (ie, tr ea tment  failure), rescue therapy 
using standa
rd of care is permitted at t he surgeon’s choi ce (including us e of ot her 
sealants, dur al pa tches , etc. [excluding further use of the IP or control in either of the 
2 groups]).  
In case of r escue therapy, t he choice of  products must be capt ured i n the eCRF (brand 
name of  the
 material used for  rescue therapy , applic ation method, amount used). 
5.4 Treatments A dministered 
Patients who are ≥18 years of age who have s igned the ICF and who are eligible b y 
intra-oper
ative inclusion/exclusion  criteria w ill undergo e lective  cranial surgery w ith 
durotom
y of the PF or  ST r egion with either craniotomy or craniectomy. The 
neurosurgical p rocedures ar e to be  performed a ccording  to the standard pr acti ces 
applicable to each indication.  
Treatments w ill be  administered int ra-ope ratively, during dural closure , and consist of 
sutures wi
th FS VH S/D 500 s-apr or sutures with DuraSeal Dural S ealant . 
5.4.1 Description of  Treatment an d Assessment of  CSF Leak (Including V als alva 
Manoeuvre) 
Dura w ill be  closed with s utures , needle si zes, and suturing techniques according to the 
surgeons’ preference. Suture specification must be captured in the eCRF (type, size, 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 29 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
 closure technique). S pecial car e will be  taken t o ensure that i f tenting  sutures ar e used,  
they do not perforate the dura. Use of tenting sutures must be captured i n the eCRF.  
The surgeon will visually inspect the dural suture line for CSF leakage after application 
of the allocated t reatment  (FS V H S/D 500  s-apr or DuraSeal D ur al Se alant) and  after 
waiting  at least 3 minutes  if the  treatment is F S VH S/D  500 s-apr. C S F lea ks will be  
defined
 as any overt flow, seepage , weeping, or sweati ng of CSF through the dura suture 
line, regardless of volume. Patients who have a CSF leak, as defined by observing a 
spontaneous CSF 
leak or CSF leak after Valsalva manoeuvre (Section  5.3.3) after 
primary suturing will h ave their randomisa tion assignment (Section 5.5) applied. 
If the sutur
e line is w ater tight (ie, no CSF l eak), then the suture line must be inspected 
again after applying the Valsalva manoeuvre (intrathoracic pressure increased to 25 cm 
H2O for up 
to 5 - 10 seconds; Section 5.3.3). If the suture line after the Valsalva 
manoeuvre is w atertight, t he treatment  is deemed a s uccess , ie, intra-operative CSF l eak 
free. 
Note: A
fter the end of the surgic al intervention of the brain, physiologic liquids (eg, 
physiological saline) are to be used to prevent any pneumocephalus and to ensure 
evaluat
ion of the primary endpoint (no intra-operative CSF l eakag e and 30 (±3)-day 
post- operat
ive CSF l eakage). 
5.5 Method of Assigning P atients to Treatment G roups 
T
he patient will be  randomis ed in a 1:1 alloca tion ratio s tra tified b y center and surgical 
regions (PF or ST) to 1 o f 2 treatment arms: 
•Investigational product: FS VH S/D 500 s- apr
OR 
•Control : DuraSeal Dural Sealant
5.6 Blinding 
This study will be  single -blind (patient), as investigator blinding is not possible due t o the 
visual and  physical difference b etwee n the 2 tr eatment regimens. P atients w ill be  kept 
blinded throughout the study. In addition, the surgeon performing the surgery will remain 
blinded until intra-o perative entry criteria have been c onfirmed (see Section 5.2).  

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 30 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  Otherwise, investigators, surgery personnel, site study personnel, clinical research 
organi sation  personnel, and sponsor personnel will not be blinded. Adequate block size 
will be used to prevent guessing the allocation in the trial and to ensure real blin ding. 
Flexible random block sizes will be also used based on the stratification factors (site and surgical region), eg, relative small block sizes will be used to maintain balance in small strata whereas relative large block sizes will be used in large strata.  
5.7 Concomitant Therapy  and Prohibited Medications  
5.7.1 Concomitant Therapy  
The following medications and non-drug therapies are permitted before study entry and during the course of the study:  
Medications:  
• Prophylactic antibiotics from 1 - 2 days before surgery

• Standard use of peri- operative steroids (ie, corticosteroids) is permitted. Chronic 
steroid use (defined as daily use of corticosteroids for ≥8 weeks) for the purposes 
of reduc ing the side effects of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for cancer is 
not exclusionary unless the patient is deemed by the investigator to be suffering from steroid toxicity (ie, Cushing's syndrome) manifested by symptoms and signs such as thin skin, striae, easy bruising, muscle atrophy, upper body obesity, severe fatigue, etc.  
• Birth control for women of childbearing potential 
• Anesthetic drugs and drugs used in the operating room such as induction agents, volatile anaesthetics , nitrous oxide, narcotics, benzodiazepines, paralytics, 
cardiovascular drugs, antihypertensives, etc.

  6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent  
The investigator or designated personnel must explain the study and the implications of 
participation (e.g., objectives, methods, anticipated benefits, and possible risks) to potential patients according to local regulations prior to any trial related activity. Patients will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate or to withdraw from the study will not have an impact on the care the patient will receive for the treatment of his/her disease. In case the patient is unable to read and write, an impartial witness must confirm the informed consent.  
The patient will be given sufficient time to read the informed consent form (ICF) and to 
ask additional questions. After this explanation and before entry in the study, consent should be appropriately recorded by means of the patient's personally dated signature (or, if applicable, by the signature of an independent witness who certifies the patient's consent in writing) and by the investigator’s signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the signed and dated informed consent must be given to the patient. 
Any patient who provides informed consent and meets the general inclusion/exclusion 
criteria is considered enrolled into the study. 
6.2 Demographics 
Demographic characteristics to be recorded at pre-operative screening will include age, 
sex, race, ethnicity, and physical characteristics such as weight  and height.  Weight will 
be recorded on Days 0, 5 (±2 days), 30 (±3  days), and 60 (±3  days) . Body mass index 
will be calculated as:  BMI = (weight in kilograms / (height in meters x height in meters)).  
6.3 Medical History 
During pre -operative screening  and on Day 0, the patient’s medical history will be 
described for the fo llowing body systems including severity or surgery and start and end 
dates, if known: eyes, ears, nose, and throat; respiratory; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal; musculoskeletal; neurological; endocrine; h aematopoietic/lymphatic; dermatological; and 
genit o-urinary.  
6.4 Physical Examination 
Physical examination will be performed at pre-operative screening , before and after 
administration of the study products during surgery (Day 0), at Day 5 (±2 days), at Day 30 (±3 days), at the study completion Day 60 (±3  days) , and at an y unscheduled 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 34 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  follow-up visit on the following body systems with special attention to the general 
appearance, head and neck, eyes and ears, nose and throat, chest, lungs, heart, abdomen, 
extremities and joints, lymph nodes, and skin.  
During pre -operative screening, if an abnormal condition is detected, the condition will 
be described on the medical history eCRF. At study visits, if a new abnormal condition or 
worsened abnormal pre-existing condition is detected, the condition will be described on the AE eCRF. If the abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it was due to an error, due to a pre- existing disease, not clinically significant, a symptom of a 
new/worsened condition already recorded as an AE, or due to another issue that wil l be 
specified, the investigator will record the justification on the AE eCRF . 
6.5 Neurological Assessment  
Neurological assessment will be performed at pre-operative screening, before and after 
administration of the study products during surgery (Day 0), at Day 5 (±2 days), at Day 30 (±3 days), at the study completion Day 60 (±3 days) , and at an  unscheduled 
follow-up visit.  
During pre -operative screening, if an abnormal condition is detected, the condition will 
be described on the medical history eCRF. At study visits, if a new abnormal condition or 
worsened abnormal pre-existing condition is detected, the condition will be described on the AE eCRF. If the abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it was due to an error, due to a pre- existing disease, not clinically significant, a symptom of a 
new/worsened condition already recorded as an AE, or due to another issue that will be specified, the investigator will record the justification on the AE eCRF.  
6.6 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include body temperature ( tymp anic; °C), respiratory rate (breaths/min), 
pulse rate (beats/min), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). Blood pressure will be measured when patients are in the supine position.  
Vital signs will be measured at pre-operative screening, before and after administration of 
the study products during surgery (D ay 0) , at Day 5 (±2 days), at Day 30 (±3 days), at the 
study completion Day 60 (±3  days) , and at an y unscheduled follow-up visit.  
Vital sign values are to be recorded on the eCRF. For each abnormal vital sign value, the 
investigator will determine whether or not to report an AE (see definition in Section  6.12 
and recor d the medical diagnosis [preferably], symptom, or sign on the AE eCRF).  

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 35 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or aetiology 
of an abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated. Any abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator.  
6.7 Electrocardiogram  
A resting 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at pre-operative screening 
and on Days 0, 5 (±2  days) , 30 (±3  days), and 60 (±3 days) . Patients should be rested for 
at least 5  minutes in the supine position before the ECG evaluation. Electrocardiograms 
will be performed before blood sample collection. 
Parameters that will be recorded include: heart rate,  ventricular  polarization (QRS), the 
interval that extends from the beginning of the P wave (the onset of atrial depolarization) 
until the beginning of the QRS complex ( PR interval) , the uncorrected measure of the 
time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T  wave in the heart's electrical 
cycle ( QT interval ), and rhythm analysis.  
The pre- operative screening ECG is not necessary if a recent ECG is available as of 
≤3 months before planned surgery.  
6.8 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.8.1 Laboratory Parameters  
Clinical laboratory parameters will be assessed at pre-operative screening and at Day s 0, 
5 (±2  days) , 30 (±3  days) , 60 (±3  days) , and any unscheduled follow-up visit (see 
Appendix 4 for tests and timing ). For evaluation of clinical laboratory findings, the 
investigator will use the Common Terminology Criteria for A Es (CTCAE) toxicity 
grading scale Version  4.03 as described in  Appendix 5.  
Women of childbearing potential will be required to take a blood beta-human chorionic 
gonadotropin (β-hCG ) test at pre-operative screening and a urine β- hCG test the day of 
surgery ( Day 0).  
Patients will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. Clinical laboratory tests that will be conducted are presented in  Table  1.

3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  6.8.3 Toxicity Grading Scale 
Laboratory values will be evaluated according to the CTCAE Version 4.03 toxicity 
grading scale and captured on the eCRF by the investigator. Grades 3 and 4 will be considered AEs and reported appropriately. The laboratory parameters and the corresponding grading scale are provided in Appendix 5. Laboratory parameters not covered by the CTCAE toxicity scale will be evaluated according to normal values assigned by the local laboratory.   
6.8.4 Surgical Site Infections 
The surgeon or designated physician will evaluate the patients for SSI s on Follow -up 
visits at Days 5 (±2 days) , 30 (± 3 days) , and 60 (±3  days) , and at unscheduled visits 
according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National 
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) guidelines found in  Appendix 8.  
6.9 Dispensing Study Drug  
6.9.1 FS VH S/D 500 -s 
The IP for this protocol is FS VH S/D 500 s-apr in its frozen presentation and must be thawed and prepared using the method described in Appendix 6. When applying FS VH S/D 500 s- apr, the investigator will apply the IP by dripping the FS onto the 
suture lines. Use of the spray FS formulation (which utilises pressurized gas in the dispensing mechanism) is prohibited during neurosurgery , due to the risk of 
pneumocephalus, as well as other associated risks, such as air embolism, tissue rupture, or gas entrapment with compression, which may be life-threatening.  
Approximately 2 mL FS VH S/D 500 s- apr will be needed to cover a suture line 10 cm 
long and 1 cm wide (10 cm
2), as per the package insert. Before application, the wound 
surface should be as dry as possible. Only a thin layer of FS VH S/D 500 s-apr should be applied. Excessive thickness of the fibrin layer may interfere with the product’s efficacy and the wound healing process. After application of FS VH S/D 500 s-apr, the IP must rest 3 minutes  before the test for CSF leak is evaluated (visual inspection/Valsalva 
manoeuvre) in order for the IP to polymerize and get sufficient tensile strength.  
If needed, a second application of FS VH S/D 500 s- apr is allowed as evaluated by the 
surgeon; however, avoid re-application of FS VH S/D 500 s-apr to a pre- existing 
polymerized FS VH S/D 500 s- apr layer because FS VH S/D 500 s -apr may not adhere 
firmly to a polymerized layer. If a second application of FS VH S/D 500 s- apr is given, it 
is mandatory to wait for additional 3 minutes before evaluating for CSF leaks (visual 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 38 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  inspection/Valsalva manoeuvre). There is a maximum of 2 allowable applications of the 
IP. 
Important for application of the IP:  
• The IP must be warmed to 37°C and maintained at that temperature until ready to 
apply. 
• Keep the dura surface adjacent to the suture as dry as possible immediately before and during application of the IP.  
• Expel the first 5 drops from the syringe then begin IP application. 
• Apply the IP in a thin layer only.  
• In order to provide optimis ed polymerization, it is important that the IP is not 
interfered with or manipulated during the resting time of 3 minutes.  
 
If application is interrupted, clogging will occur immediately in the cannula. Replace the 
application c annula with a new one immediately before application is resumed.  
It is important to note that the sealer protein and thrombin solutions are denatured by alcohol, iodine, or heavy metal ions. If any of these substances have been used to clean the wound area, the area must be thoroughly rinsed before application of FS VH S/D  500 s-apr. The wound surface and margins should be as dry and clear of 
clots, fluids, hemostatic agents, and loose connective tissue as possible Oxidized cellulose -containing preparation s may reduce the efficacy of FS VH S/D 500 s-apr and 
should not be used as carrier materials. Additionally, the safety and efficacy of the combined use of FS VH S/D 500 s- apr with other biocompatible carrier materials has not 
been evaluated in controlled c linical trials.  
6.9.2 DuraSeal Dural Sealant 
The control for this protocol, DuraSeal Dural Sealant , must be prepared using the method 
described in  Appendix 7.  When applying the DuraSeal hydrogel , the investigator will 
apply the product by using the DuraSeal Systems applicator to spray the hydrogel onto 
the suture lines. DuraSeal must be used within 1 hour of preparation. 
Before application, the wound surface and margins (2 – 3 mm) around the durotomy edge 
should be as dry and clear of clots, fluids, hemostatic agents, and loose connective tissue as possible. Only a thin layer (1 – 2 mm) of the Dura Seal hydrogel should be applied.  
After application of the hydrogel , the patient will be  evaluated for CSF leak age (visual 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 39 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  inspection/Valsalva manoeuvre) in order for the product to polymerize and get sufficient 
tensile strength .  
If needed, a second application of the DuraSeal hydrogel is allowed as evaluated by the 
surgeon; however, avoid re-application of the DuraSeal  hydrogel  to a pre- existing 
polymerized DuraSeal because the hydrogel may not adhere firmly to a polymerized 
layer. If a second application of DuraSeal  is given, the patient will be evaluated  for CSF 
leakage (visual inspection/Valsalva manoeuvre). There is a maximum of 2  allowable 
applications of the control.  
If application is interrupted and the spray tip is plugged, remove the spray tip, wipe the 
applicator tip, and attach a new spray tip and continue delivery. Hydrogel application beyond the edges of the dural margin may be removed with scissors or mechanical disruption. Irrigation immediately after the sealant has solidified is permitted . 
6.10 Primary Efficacy Assessments 
The primary assessment is defined as the proportion of patients who have neither of the 
following :  
• Intra -operative CSF leakage from dural repair after up to 
two FS VH S/D  500 s-apr/control applications during Valsalva manoeuvre 
(25 cm  H2O for up to 5 - 10 seconds) 
• Post-operative CSF leakage within 30 (+ 3) days post- operatively.  
 
Success is defined as: an intra-operative watertight closure of the dura after suturing 
during surgery after test with the Valsalva manoeuvre (25 cm H2O for up to 
5 - 10 seconds) and no CSF leakage within 30 (+3) days post- operatively.   
Failure  is defined as: an i ntra-operative non- watertight closure , which consists of a ny 
overt flow, seepage, weeping, or sweating of CSF through the dura suture line, regardless of volume, during surgery or within 30 (+3) days post- operatively .  
6.11 Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
Secondary efficacy assessments will include :  
• Incidence of intra- operative CSF leakage following final Valsalva man oeuvre  
• Incidence of CSF leaks within 30 (+ 3) days post- operatively  
• Time in surgery (minutes)

  • Time from dural closure (application of IP) until end of surgery 
• Length of stay in hospital (days) 
 
All post-operative CSF leaks will be primarily diagnosed based on a detailed history and 
physical examination including neurological examination. Although not standard of care 
post- operatively , imaging tests such as computed tomography/magnetic resonance 
imaging will only be considered if there is a high clinical suspicion of CSF leakage. For 
example, if CSF leaks externally (eg,  incisional leaks, otorrhea, or rhinorrhea), or if there 
is any bulging suggesting subcutaneous fluid collection at the incision s ite, needle 
aspiration and the beta- 2 transferrin test or beta- trace protein will be used to confirm the 
presence of CSF.  
6.12 Safety Assessments 
The following secondary safety assessments will be performed during this study:  
• Incidence of CSF leaks within 60 (+3) days post- operatively  
• Incidence of AEs up to 60 (+3) days post- operatively  
• Incidence of SSI according to US NHSN within 30 (+ 3) days post- operatively  
• Number of unplanned interventions within 30 (+ 3) days post- operatively  
• Laboratory values and vital signs  (e.g., elevated WBC count, fever [temperature 
>100.7°F or 38.2°C], tachycardia [pulse >100], hypotension [mean arterial 
pressure <60]) .  
Adverse events will be evaluated as described in Section  6.13.  
Unplanned interventions include the management of meningitis and a deep infection, 
minimally invasive procedures, the return to the operating room for neurosurgical 
complications other than a CSF l eak or pseudomeningocele formation, or those related to 
the patient ’s pre -existing condition  during the 30- day follow -up period following original 
surgical procedure.  
Surgical site infections will be evaluated by the surgeon or designated physician accordi ng to CDC/NHSN criteria as specified in  Appendix 8.  
Vital signs and laboratory values will be evaluated as described in Sections  6.6 and 6.8.

  6.13 Adverse Events Assessments  
An adverse event ( AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product (IP). (ICH E6 [R2]).  
An elective procedure/surgery that occurs during the course of the study (ie, prior to 
signing the ICF) , but is being performed for a documented pre-existing condition and was 
pre-planned prior to study entry will not qualify as an AE.  If, however, there is an 
increase in the severity, duration, or frequency o f a pre -existing disease, the event must 
be described on the AE eCRF.  
An AE can result from the use of the study product or control in accordance with the protocol, as well as from an accidental or intentional misuse of the study product/control or any other treatment error such as unintentional administration or use of another product during the course of the study.  
6.13.1 Performing Adverse Events Assessments  
During the course of the study, the investigator or designee will routinely monitor and solicit each patient for the occurrence of any AEs , no matter how common they are for a 
particular patient and regardless of the causality . All AEs (initial, follow -up) will be 
entered in the eCRF and SAEs (initial, follow -up, upgraded AEs, revisions/amendments) 
will simultaneously be submitted using a paper SAE Report ( SAE R) Form .    
If a definitive diagnosis has been medically established by the investigator, this diagnosis should then be recorded as the AE. If a definitive diagnosis has not been medically established , the signs and symptoms should then be recorded as the AEs using standard 
medical terminology, in order to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions .  
If a patient experiences an AE , but also additionally a complication of the AE (eg, 
myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure), both the AE  and the additional 
medical complication should be collected and recorded on CRFs as separate AEs.  
Each AE will be evaluated by the investigator for seriousness, severity, and causal 
relationship to IP/control exposure or study procedure.  

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 42 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  For each AE, the outcome (ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if applicable action taken (ie, none, drug/device withdrawn, not applicable (AE occurred 
before drug/device application), or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE eCRF. If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the stop date of this AE will be recorded and a new AE report will be entered with the new severity rating.  
Deviations from the protocol-specified dosage (including use of more than the maximum 
2 allowable applications of IP/control), treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol-defined dosing and application schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard s to occurrence of 
AEs, lack of efficacy, and/or other observations because these events may be reportable to regulatory authorities. 
6.13.2 Timing 
In this study, all  SAEs and related AEs will be recorded  and reported to Baxter Global 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of awareness beginning at the time  the ICF is signed  
until the event has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline or for 30 days after the 
patient ’s study completion/termination visit, whichever comes first. If an investigator 
becomes aware of an SAE occurring in a patient after study  completion, the SAE must be 
reported on the SAER Form within 24  hours after awareness; no additional reporting on 
eCRFs is necessary.  
Adverse events occurring prior to the initiation of the first study procedure will be recorded as signs and symptoms in the patient’s medical history. Adverse events occurring between pre- operative screening and the administration of study treatment will 
be considered as unrelated to study treatment.  
For events assessed as not related or unlikely related and occurring within 2 weeks after 
administration of IP /control, the investigator shall provide the alternative etiology. These 
causality definitions will also be used to assess the relationship of an AE with a study- related procedure(s), if necessary.  
6.13.3 Severity 
The investigator will assess the severity of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment  based on the most appropriate description below:  

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 43 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  • Mild: The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the patient’s normal functioning level and/or the AE resolves spontaneously or may require minimal therapeutic intervention.  
• Moderate: The AE produces limited impa irment of function and may require 
therapeutic intervention and/or the AE produces no sequela/sequelae.  
• Severe: The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may lead to temporary inability to resume usual life pattern and/or the AE produces sequela/sequelae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic intervention.  
 
These severity definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a 
study- related procedure(s), if necessary.  
6.13.4 Relationship  
Causality is a determination of whether there is a  reasonable possibility that the 
IP/control is etiologically related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment 
includes, assessment of temporal relationships, de- challenge/re-challenge information, 
association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, and physiological plausibility. For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP /control and the AE using his/her clinical 
expertise and judg ment  according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the 
circumstances of the AE:  
• Not related (both circumstances must be met).  
1. Is due to underlying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent 
treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs.  
2. Is not associated with the IP /control (ie , does not follow a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of IP /control or has a much more likely 
alternative aetiology).  
• Unlikely related (either 1 or both circumstances are met).  
a. Has little or no temporal relationship to the IP/control. 
b. A more likely alternative aetiology exists.  
• Possibly related (both circumstances must be met).  
a. Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IP/control.  

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 44 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  b. An alternative aetiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential 
relationship to the IP/control. 
• Probably related (both circumstances must be met).  
a. Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of IP /control, 
which may include but is not limited to the following:  
a. Reappearance of a similar reaction upon re- administration (positive 
re-challenge).  
b. Positive results in a drug sensitivity test (skin test, etc .).  
c. Toxic level of the IP /control as evidenced by measurement of the 
IP/control concentrations in the blood or other bodily fluid. 
b. Another aet iology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
 
6.13.5 Expectedness  
The only expected AEs that may be related to the IP/control in this study is the reaction 
to the IP/control (i.e., allergic reaction) , which will be evaluated and if observed, 
standard -of-care will be applied. Patient s with an aprotinin allergy will be excluded from 
the study. 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction is any adverse reaction that is classified 
as serious and is suspected to be caused by the investigational drug but is not consistent with the information found in the product current IB.
  For the purposes of this study, each 
unexpected AE experienced by a patient undergoing neurosurgical intervention will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
6.13.6 Adverse Events of S pecial Interest 
Patients will be closely monitored for any signs of sterile meningitis during surgery and follow-up visits. In case signs and symptoms of sterile meningitis are present during the 
study, the investigator will assess these symptoms,  and order and review diagnostic 
procedures, as appropriate, to confirm the diagnosis.  
6.13.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
The investigator’s assessment of each relevant laboratory value will be recorded on the 
eCRF. For each abnormal laboratory value, the investigator will determine whether the value is considered clinically significant or not. For clinically significant values, the investigator will indicate if the values constitute a new AE and record the sign, symptom, 
or medical diagnosis on the AE eCRF. The investigator will also record on the AE eCRF 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 45 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  whether the clinically significant values are symptoms or related to previously recorded 
AEs, are due to pre-existing diseases, or are due to other issues. Adverse events that are 
grade 3 and 4 will be considered AEs and reported appropriately. The laboratory parameters and the corresponding grading scale are provided in Appendix 4. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or aetiology of an 
abnormal value or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated . Any abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
Any seroconversion result for HIV, HAV, HBV, HCV, hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) sha ll be re -tested.  
6.13.8 Serious Adverse Events  
6.13.8.1 Definition  
An SAE  is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitaliz ation , or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment , they may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or  at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Moreover, reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for HIV, HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV, or 
B19V will also be important med ical events that shall qualify as an SAE . 
6.13.8.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator will report all SAEs to the pharmacovigilance safety desk of the contract 
research organisation (CRO). The CRO  will verify that the  applicable laws/requirements 
for reporting SAEs to the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Ethics Committees ( ECs) 
are followed by  the sponsor (Baxter). The sponsor will expedite the SAE R forms  to the 
appropriate regulatory authorit y(ies).   

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 46 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
 •ALL SAEs ARE TO BE REPORTED TO THE CRO’S SAFETY DESK ON THE
SAE R FORM WITHIN 24  HOURS AND TRANSMITTED ALONG WITH
ANY DE -IDENTIFIED SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION IN THE
ENGLISH LANGUAGE TO THE SPONSOR WITHIN 24 HOURS OF
BECOMING AWARE OF THE EVENT
See SAER form for contact information.  
Further details are also available in the study team roster.  
For definit
ions and information on the assessment of these events, refer to the following: 
•Section
 6.13, Adverse Events Assessments
•Section 6.13.1, Performing Adverse Events Assessments
•Section 6.13.8, Serious Adverse Events 
6.13.9 Urgent S
afety Measures  
An urgent safety measure is an immediate action taken, which is not defined by the 
protocol, in order to protect patients participating in a clinical trial from immediate harm. 
Urgent safety measures may be taken by the sponsor or clinical investigator, and may include any of the following:  
•Immediate change in study design or study procedures
•Temporary or permanent halt of a given clinical trial or trials
•Any other immediate action taken in order to protect clinical trial participants
from immediate hazard to their health and safety .
The investigator may take appropriate urgent safety measures in order to protect patients 
against any immediate hazard to their health or safety. The measures should be taken 
immediately and may be taken without prior authorisation from the sponsor. In the event(s) of an apparent immediate hazard to the pat ient, the investigator will notify the 
sponsor immediately by phone and confirm notification to the sponsor in writing as soon as possible, but within 1 calendar day after the change is implemented. The i nvestigator 
will also ensure the responsible IRB/EC and national competent authority ( NCA) is 
notified of the urgent measures taken in such cases according to local regulations. The CRO should verify that the responsible IRB/EC and the sponsor (Baxter) have been informed of the event in an expedited manner as stated above.

  6.13.10 Untoward Medical Occurrences  
Untoward medical occurrences occurring before the first exposure to IP /control are not 
considered AEs; however, each serious untoward medical occurrence experienced before 
the first IP /control exposure (ie, from the time of signed IC F up to but not including the 
first IP /control exposure) will be described on the SAER form . 
6.13.11 Treatment -emergent Adverse Events  
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as any AE that occurs after the onset of study 
treatment administration  through the end of the study.  
6.14 Concomitant Medication Assessments  
Ongoing prior medications will be recorded as concomitant medication once the study treatment has been initiated. During treatment, concomitant medications and therapies (including dose, frequency, start and stop dates, and indication for use), will be recorded in the eCRF by study site personnel on a daily basis. 
6.15 Non-Medical Complaints  
A non- medical complaint (NMC) is any alleged product deficiency that relates to 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, and performance of the product but does 
not result in an AE. Non- medical complaints include but are not limited to the following:  
• A failure of a product to exhibit its expected pharmacological activity and/or 
design function (eg, r econstitution difficulty).  
• Missing components.  
• Damage to the product or unit carton.  
• A mislabelled  product (eg, potential counterfeiting/tampering).  
• A bacteriological, chemical, or physical change or deterioration of the product causing it to malfunction or to present a hazard or fail to meet label claims.  
 
Any NMCs of the product will be documented on an NMC form and reported to the 
sponsor within 1 business day. If requested, the defective product(s) will be returned to the sponsor for inspection and analysis according to procedures. 
6.16 Removal of Patient s from the Trial or Study Drug  
A patient is considered to have completed the study when he/she ceases active 
participation in the study because the patient has, or is presumed to have, completed all 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 48 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
 study procedure s accordi ng with the protocol (wi th or without protocol deviations). A ny 
other cas es are classified as dis continuation. 
Reas ons for completion/discontinuation wil l be reporte d on the 
Completion/Discontinuation eCRF, including : Completed, A E (eg, d eath), 
discontinuation b y patient (eg, los t to follow -up [defined a s 3 docum ented unsuccessful 
attempt s to contac t the patient], dropout), physician decision (eg, pregnancy , progressive 
disea
se, protoc ol violation[s], recovery), stud y terminated b y sponsor, o r other (reason to 
be specified b y the investigator [eg, t echnica l problems] ). Screening failures w ill be 
recorded
 on the Screening Fail ures form.  Regardless of the reason, all data av ailable for 
the patient up to the time of completion/discontinuation shoul d be recorde d on t he 
appropriate eCRF. 
Ever y eff
ort will be made to have discontinued patient s complet e the study 
completion/termination visit. If the completion/termination visit is done as an additional, 
unsc
hedule
d visit, t he assessme nt result s shall be r ecorded with t he 
completion/termination visit. If a p atient terminates participation in the study and does 
not return f or the completion/termination visit, his/her la st recorded asse ssments s hall 
remain recorde d with his/he r last visit. T he re ason for discontinuation wil l be recor ded 
and t he data collected up to t he time of discontinuation wil l be used in t he analysi s and 
included in t he clinica l study report . If additiona l asse ssment s are require d, the 
assessments shall 
be recorded separately. Assessments to be performed at the termination 
visit (including cases of withdraw or discontinuation) can be found in Appendix 2 
(Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments) and Appendix 4 (Cli nical Laboratory 
Assessments). 
In the event of patient discontinuation due to an AE, clinica l and/or laboratory 
investigati ons that are beyond t he scope of the required stud y obs ervations/assessments 
may be performed a s part of the eval uation of the event. Thes e investigation s will take 
place unde r the direction of the invest igator in consultation with t he sponsor, and the 
detail s of the outcome may be reported to t he appropr iate regulator y authoritie s by the 
sponsor.

 7.STUDY ACTIVITIES
7.1 Screening  and Study Visits  
The study site is responsible for maintaining an enrolment/screening log that includes all 
patients enrolled. The log will also serve to document the reason for screening failure.  
The overall study design is illustrated in  Appendix 1. Details on the procedures to be 
performed at each study visit, including screening, can be found in Appendix 2 (Schedule 
of Study Procedures and A ssessments) and  Appendix 4 (Clinical Laboratory 
Assessments).  
7.2 Pre-operative Screening Visit (Days -30 to -1) 
•Obtain IC.

  8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
8.1 Auditing  
The sponsor and/or sponsor’s representatives may conduct audits to evaluate study 
conduct and compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, other written instructions/agreements, International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) Good Clinical 
Practice ( GCP ), the IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory guidelines/requirements. The 
investigator will permit auditors to visit the study site, as described in the Clinical Study Agreement. Auditing processes specific to the study will be described in the auditing plan. 
8.2 Non-compliance with the Protocol  
The investigator may deviate from the protocol only to eliminate an apparent immediate 
hazard to the patient. In the event(s) of an apparent immediate hazard to the patient, the investigator will notify the CRO  immediately by phone and will confirm notification to 
the CRO in writing as soon as possible, but within 1 calendar day after the change is 
implemented. The investigator will also ensure the responsible IRB/EC /NCA is notified 
of the urgent measures taken in such cases according to local regulations.  
If monitoring and/or auditing identify serious and/or persistent non- compliance with the 
protocol, the CRO may terminate the investigator’s participation. The CRO will notify 
the IRB/EC and applicable regulatory authorities of any investigator termination.

 9.PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 General Considerations  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) is a separate document that will provide a more 
technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features stat ed in the protocol. Any 
deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final clinical 
trial report.  
9.2 Determination of Sample Size 
This study is designed to show non- inferiority  (NI)  of FS VH S/D 500 s- apr compared to 
DuraSeal Dural Sealant based on the primary composite efficacy endpoint. The proportion of patient s meeting the composite primary endpoint is assumed to be % for 
FS VH S/D 500 s -apr and % for DuraSeal. Using a non- inferiority margin of 10% 
(the largest clinically acceptable difference), a 1 -sided  Type 1 error rate (α) of 2.5%, a 
statistical power (1 -β) of 80%, that one interim analysis is performed after 50% of the 
patients complete the study , the sample size  estima tion results in 202 evaluable patients. 
Assuming a group sequential design utilis ing O’Brien -Fleming boundaries, the study may 
be stopped early for futility if a p- value >0. 2486 is observed at the interim. The 
estimation of sample size was performed using  software ( , 
).  
The primary analysis will be performed on the per protocol set (PPS). Assuming that the PPS is 10% less than the total number of randomis ed patient s, 112 patients per treatment 
group should be randomised, and there will be 224 patients in total.  
9.2.1 Justification of Non- Inferiority Margin 
The 10% NI margin is mainly based on literature review, the screening of multiple key 
opinion leaders ( clinical judgment),  and a previous clinical study for a comparable 
product that led to biologic license application ( BLA ) approval.  
•Literatur
e review (Weber 2012)8: In a retrospective analysis of 1395 cranial  
surgeries, post-operative CSF leaks occur in approximately 7.7%, across all types 
of cranial surgeries. However, tight dural sutures by inspection were followed by 
CSF leaks in 4.7%. Tight suturing of the dura mater with additional securing and/
or augmentation of the sutur e by a different technique ( covering with muscle or 
fascia flab, gelitta, fibrin glue, hydrogel gel, or others) is performed 68% of the 
time. The subgroups with different dural closure augmentation techniques

  (fleece-bound sealant, glue, dural- plasties, e tc.) were too small  to detect any 
statistically demonstrable effect on CSF leaks after cranial surgery.  
• Clinical judgment: Based upon discussion with clinicians (neurosurgeons) on the 
use of dural sealants as an adjunct to suture line, the consensus was that NI could be claimed if the maximum difference of success rate (ie, CSF leakage free) between the new treatment (Tisseel) and the current treatment (DuraSeal) is 10%, with the assumption that the proportion of patients meeting the composite primary endpoint is at least 85.0% for DuraSeal.   
• Previous clinical study: A 10% NI margin was used in a previous Phase III pivotal, NI study. In this study, a new dural sealant (Adherus) was compared to the same control (DuraSeal) and the study design including patient population, eligibility criteria, and the primary endpoint was very similar to the current Tisseel study .
29 Thus, the assumed proportion of 90.6% for DuraSeal in the 
current Tisseel study is based on results of this previous study evaluating Adherus and DuraSeal.  
 
9.3 Analysis Populations  
9.3.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
The patients who were randomised and treated with at least 1 dose of IP/control will be 
included in the Full Analysis Set ( FAS).   
9.3.2 Per Protocol Set (PPS)  
The p atients included in the FAS without any major protocol deviations, which could 
impact the primary endpoint assessment, will be included in the Per Protocol Set ( PPS). 
The PPS is  defined by the following :  
• Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria.  
• Patients who are randomised and treated according to the randomisation scheme.  
• Patients with  no major protocol deviations which could impact the primary 
endpoint assessment.  
• Availability of primary endpoint assessment.  
 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 56 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  Furthermore, any other major protocol violations, such as serious unforeseen violations 
deemed to invalidate the data and affect the conclusions of the study, will lead to the exclusion of patients from the PPS.  
9.3.3 Safety Analysis Set 
The patients who received at least 1 dose of IP
/control will be included in the Safety 
Analysis Set. Patients will be analysed as treated (in case of incorrect randomisations).  
9.4 Methods of Analysis 
The efficacy endpoints will be analysed for the FAS and the PPS, with the PPS being 
considered as primary and the FAS as supportive.   
The safety  endpoints will be analysed for the safety data using the safety analysis set .  
Categorical  data will be summarised using frequencies and percentages, while continuous 
data will be presented using descriptive summary statistics (the number of patients [N], mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum).  
No imputation of missing data will be performed, unless otherwise specified. All efficacy and safety endpoints will be listed in patient data listings.  
9.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics of demographics and other baseline characteristics will be presented 
for the FAS population by treatment group and total in order to assess the degree of 
similarity achieved.  
9.4.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who have neither of the 
following: 
• Intra -operative CSF leakage from dural repair after up to two  
FS VH S/D  500 s-apr/control applications during Valsalva manoeuver (25 cm 
H2O for up to 5 - 10 seconds)  
• Post-operative CSF leakage within 30 (+ 3) days post- operatively  
 
The specific hypotheses of the proportion difference to be tested are as follows:  
H0: PFS – P DS ≤ -0.10 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 57 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  Ha: PFS – P DS > -0.10 
where  
PFS = the proportion of patients not meeting the 2 criteria ( ie, no intra- operative CSF 
leakage and no post-operative CSF leakage) for the FS VH S/D 500 s- apr treatment 
group, and 
PDS = the proportion of patients not meeting the 2 criteria ( ie, no intra- operative CSF 
leakage and no post- operative CSF leakage) for the DuraSeal Dural Sealant treatment 
group. 
The primary composite efficacy endpoint, proportion of patients not meeting the 
2 criteria (ie, no intra -operative CSF leakage and no post- operative CSF leakage), will be 
investigated by a 2 -sided test for non- inferiority using logistic regression, taking into 
account the following covariates: study center and surgery region. Non- inferiority  of FS 
VH S/D 500 s -apr to DuraSeal Dural Sealant will be assessed using the confidence 
interval approach and a NI margin of 10%.  
9.4.3 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoint s 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are the following: 
• Incidence of intra- operative CSF leakage following final Valsalva manoeuver  
• Incidence of CSF leaks within 30 (+3) days post- operatively  
• Time in surgery (minutes)  
• Time from dural closure (application of IP) until end of surgery 
• Length of stay in hospital (days)  
 
The logistic regressio n approach used for the primary efficacy endpoint will also be used 
to calculate the proportions of patients with  incidence of intra- operative CSF leakage 
following final Valsalva man oeuver  and incidence of CSF leaks within 30 (+ 3) days 
post-operatively.  
The time in surgery, time from dural closure until end of surgery, and the length of stay 
in hospital will be compared between the 2 groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.  

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 58 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  9.4.4 Secondary  Safety Endpoint s 
The secondary  safety endpoints are the following: 
• Incidence of CSF leaks within 60 (+ 3) days post- operatively  
• Incidence of AEs up to 60 (+ 3) days post- operatively  
• Incidence of SSIs according to US NHSN within 30 (+ 3) days post- operatively  
• Number of unplanned interventions within 30 (+ 3) days post- operatively  
• Laboratory values and vital signs  (e.g., elevated WBC count, fever [temperature 
>100.7°F or 38.2°C], tachycardia [pulse >100], hypotension [mean arterial 
pressure <60]). 
 
The logistic regression  approach used for the primary efficacy endpoint will be u sed to 
calculate the proportions of patients with : incidence of CSF leaks within 60 (+3) days 
post-operatively, and  incidence of SSIs according to NHSN within 30 (+ 3) days post-
operatively . The duration and incidence of each laboratory and vital sign abnormality will 
be recorded.  Abnormal laboratory values will be observed, followed, and managed by the 
investigator for  a return to baseline, per standard of care.  
The number of unplanned interventions within 30 (+ 3) days post- operatively will be 
compared  between the 2 treatment groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
An AE overview summary table will be prepared including the number of patients 
reporting an AE, the percentage of patients (%) with an AE, and the number of events reported, for the following categories:  
1. Deaths.  
2. SAEs.  
3. AEs leading to withdrawal.  
4. Severe AEs.  
5. Related AEs.  
6. AEs of special interest . 
 
Adverse events will be tabulated by body system using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) . The table will display the total number of patients 
reporting an AE, the percentage of patients (%) with an AE, and the number of events 

FS VH S/D 500 s- apr Page 59 of 88 
3599- 001: Clinical Trial Protocol  Final Amendment 2, 06 Nov 2017  
  
 
   
  reported by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. In addition, tables will be 
summaris ed by SOC, preferred ter m, and severity.  
These tables will be produced for: 
• All AEs.  
• AEs with an incidence ≥5% of patients in any treatment arm. 
• Non-serious AEs with an incidence ≥5% of patients in any treatment arm. 
• AEs by causality (related/unrelated).  
• AEs leading to death.  
• AEs by severity.  
• SAEs.  
• AEs leading to withdrawal.  
 
Listings will be prepared for: 
• All AEs sorted by cent er and patient.  
• SAEs.  
• AEs leading to death.  
• AEs leading to withdrawal.  
• Laboratory results and vital signs. 
 
9.5 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted after the completion of 50% of patients. A group 
sequential design utilis ing O’Brien -Fleming boundaries will be carried out. Basic 
demographic tables will be produced during the interim analysis. The study may be 
stopped early for futility if a p -value >0. 2486 is observed. If the study is stopped early, a 
full analysis of all of the data will be produced.

Study Title  
A Phase I, Open -label, Fixed -sequence, Drug Interaction Study to Investigate the Effect of 
Single and Multiple Oral Doses of LOXO -305 on the Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Oral 
Doses of Digoxin (P- Glycoprotein Substrate) in Healthy Subjects  
Objective s 
The primary objectives of the study are: 
•to assess the effect of single and multiple oral doses of LOXO -305 on the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple oral doses of digoxin (P-gp substrate) in healthy
subjects.
•to assess the PK of LOXO -305 administered with multiple doses of digoxin at steady
state in healthy subjects.
The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of LOXO -305 when coadministered with multiple oral doses of digoxin. 
Study Desi gn  
This is a Phase 1, open-label, fixed-sequence drug-drug interaction study to investigate the effect of single and multiple oral doses of LOXO-305 on the PK of multiple oral doses of digoxin (P-gp substrate) in healthy subjects.  
On Day 1, subjects will be administered 0.25 mg digoxin twice daily (BID; loading dose), 
once in the morning and evening. Subjects will be fasted for at least 2 hours predose and 1-hour postdose for the morning and evening dose.
On Days 2 through 16, oral doses of 0.25 mg digoxin once daily (QD) will be administered 
(total of 17 consecutive doses) at the actual time of the Day 1 morning digoxin dose (± 1 hour). On Days 8 through 16 (9 consecutive doses), oral doses of 200 mg LOXO -305 
QD will be coadministered with 0.25  mg digoxin QD, at the actual time of the Day 1 morning 
digoxin dose (± 1 hour). LOXO-305 will be administered first, immediately followed by digoxin. On Days 2, 4 through 6, 9 through 11, 13, and 14, subjects will fast for at least 2 hours predose and 1-hour postdose. On Days 3, 12, and 15 where clinical laboratory evaluations are performed, subjects will fast for at least 8  hours predose and 1-hour postdose. 
On Days 7, 8, and 16, subjects will be fasted at least 10 hours predose and 2 hours postdose. Blood and urine samples for concentrations of digoxin in plasma and urine and

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 7 of 70 To a
ssess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28  days 
(Days  -29 to - 2) and be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day  -1 (Check- in). 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check- in (Day  -1) until End of 
Treatment (EOT) on Day  20 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early 
Termination (ET) if the subject discontinues. Dosing of digoxin will occur on Days 1 through 
16 and dosing of LOXO-305 will occur on Days 8 through 16. A follow-up phone call will occur for all subjects who received at least 1  dose of study drug (including subjects who are 
terminated early) 7  days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET.  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first subject who is enrolled in the study signs 
an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects who are assigned to receive a dose of study drug; this definition excludes screen failure subjects. Repl acement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by the Sponsor.  
In this study, physical examinations, 12- lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign 
measurements, How Do You Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation parameters, hematology panel, urinalysis ( Appendix 2), safety monitoring of serum  digoxin 
level s, and recording of concomitant medications will be performed at specified times during 
the study (for specific timepoints and de tails on each study variable, refer to Appendix 4).  
Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call) are to be reported. 
Study completion is defined as the time of the last subject’s follow -up phone call.

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 9 of 70 Planned Study Conduct Duration: Up to 58 days (Screening through follow-up call).  
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood and urine samples for concentrations of digoxin in plasma and urine and  
 
 Blood samples for concentrations of LOXO-305 and digoxin in plasma 
and  
 Urine samples for concentrations of digoxin and
 
Samples col lected for the analysis of plasma and urine concentrations of 
digoxin and plasma concentrations of LOXO-305 may be stored and analyzed  
 
The following PK parameters will be calculated, whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of digoxin and LOXO- 305: area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) 
from hour 0 to 24 hours postdose ( AUC 0-24), AUC from hour 0 to the last measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-t), AUC during a dosing interval (AUC tau), apparent systemic clearan ce 
(CL/F), maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), time to C max (tmax), and mean 
residence time (MRT).  
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the urine concentrations of digoxin: amount of drug excreted unchanged in urine (A
e), fraction of drug 
excreted unchanged in urine (F e), and renal clearance (CLr).  
Safety: 
Safety will be monitored with HDYF? inquiries, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign 
measurements, 12 -lead ECGs, physical examinations, and safety  mon itoring of serum 
digoxin levels . 
Statistical Methods  
Pharmacokinetics:  
The primary analysis planned for this study is a mixed effect model that includes treatment as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. The analysis will be performed on the natural log (ln)- transformed PK parameters (AUC
0-t, AUC 0-24, and C max) and include calculation of 
least squared (LS) means and the difference between treatment LS  means, as well as their 
corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs). The geometric mean ratios and their 90% CIs of the PK parameter for each treatment comparison will be constructed using the exponentiation of the difference and the CIs from the mixed effect model. The comparisons of interest will be as follows: 
• Multiple doses of digoxin coadministered with multiple doses of LOXO-305 versus multiple doses of digoxin alone.

Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed information concerning the avail able 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) profile 
of the investigational medicinal product, LOXO-305.1 
1.1. Background 
LOXO-305 (also known as LY3527727) i s a selective inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase ( BTK) being developed by Loxo Oncology. LOXO-305 is distinct from the approved 
BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib) in several important ways including on the basis of its selec tivity, favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion properties, and non-covalent binding mode.
2 These features enable LOXO -305 to 
achieve pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures that exceed the BTK concentration resulting in 90% inhibition (IC
90) at trough, and thus deliver tonic BTK target inh ibition throughout the dosing 
period, regardless of the intrinsic rate of BTK turnover. Moreover, the non-covalent binding mode of LOXO-305 is unaffected by BTK C481 substitutions, a common mechanism of drug resistance described for all available covalent inhibitors.
3,4,5,6,7 Finally, LOXO-305 is also a 
highly selective molecule that is more than 300-fold more selective for BTK versus 370 other kinases tested with no significant inhibition of non-kinase off- targets at 1 µM, thus limiting 
the potential for off-target mediated toxicities. Collectively, these unique properties of LOXO-305 are expected to deliver more potent, continuous, and selective inhibition of BTK in a variety of settin gs, potentially resulting in increased efficacy. Of note, the activity of 
LOXO-305 in diverse preclinical model systems supports this underlying hypothesis.

LOXO-305 is a small molecule that was designed to block the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the BTK kinase competitively. There is no evidence of irreversible binding. LOXO-305 has a molecular weight of approximately 500 g/mol. LOXO -305 will be supplied 
as an immediate -release tablet containing 100 mg of drug substance. 
1.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology Summary  
LOXO-305 had high permeability in vitro, but low aqueous solubility. To reduce the 
variability in oral absorption, a spray -dried dispersion (SDD) tablet formulation was 
developed that showed consistent oral bioavailability of approximately 50% in rats and 80% 
in dogs. The bioavailability of the SDD formulation was also not dependent on feeding state in dogs. 
As is common in rodents, oral exposure of LOXO-305 was consistently much higher in 
female rats than in males given the same dose of LOXO -305. The sex difference was also 
apparent after intravenous (IV) administration of LOXO -305. There was no difference in the 
PK of LOXO-305 between sexes of dog, and none is expected in other non- rodent species, 
including humans.  
The volume of distribution (V
z) of LOXO-305 ranged from approximately 2 L/kg in the dog 
to 5 L/kg in the male rat, which indicates that LOXO -305 distributes into tissues. LOXO-305 
had protein binding of approximately 95% in human plasma. A somewhat lower extent of 
binding (approximately 82% to 92%) was observed across mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog.

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 18 of 70 LOXO-305 was metabolized slowly by human microsomal fractions and hepatocytes. The 
low rates of metabolism in both these human in vitro systems suggest that LOXO- 305 will 
have low clearance in humans. In vitro data with clone expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4 is the primary CYP enzyme that metabolizes LOXO -305. It is also a substrate for direct glucuronidation. 
In long-term hepatocyte incubations, LOXO- 305 was metaboli zed by both oxidation and 
glucuronidation. Inhibition of oxidative metabolism by addition of the P450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole showed that oxidative metabolism is CYP dependent. All metabolites formed by human hepatocytes were also formed in rat and/or dog hepatocytes supporting the use of rat and dog for nonclinical safety assessment.  
Renal clearance of LOXO -305 in male and female rats was negligible. No data on renal 
clearance are available in other species; however, the renal excretion pathway is o ften 
conserved across species, and therefore no renal clearance would be expected in humans.  
In a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vitro assay for human ether-à-go-go- related gene 
(hERG) activity, the concentration resulting in 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
50) for the 
inhibitory effects of LOXO-305 on hERG potassium currents was  μM, which is approximately  higher than the maximum unbound concentration of LOXO-305 in patients treated with the dose of 200 mg once daily (QD). There were no LOXO -305- relate d 
changes in any cardiovascular endpoints including QTc at single doses up to 60 mg/kg in the GLP cardiovascular study in the conscious telemetry -instrumented dog. The maximum 
observed plasma concentration (C
max) for this dose was  ng/mL, which is 
approximately  above the predicted C max (  ng/mL) at the proposed clinical 
therapeutic dose of 200 mg QD. Furthermore, there were no LOXO-305- related 
abnormalities in rhythm or waveform morphology in the GLP 28- day repeated -dose toxicity 
study in dogs at the low and mid-dose groups based on comparison of predose and postdose electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. The high dose (90/60 mg/kg/dose twice daily [BID]) 
was not evaluated as animals in this group were moribund/debilitated and were terminated on Day 13. Mean QTc interval was statistically significantly prolonged (+6%; +15 msec) on Day 26 of the dosing phase in males administered 30/10 mg/kg/dose BID compared with 
controls. The prolongation in QTc for males was below the 10% increase or the threshold reported for canines exposed to therapeutic concentrations of drugs known to cause QT prolongation in humans.
8 Therefore, the QTc changes were considered physiologically 
unimportant, and thus not deemed to be adverse. Together, these data indicate that 
LOXO-305 has a low risk of inducing delayed ventricular repolarization, prolongation of the QTc interval , and unstable arrhythmias in patients. 
There were no LOXO -305-related findings on the central nervous system when evaluated in 
rat functional observational battery tests and locomotor activity assessments after 4 weeks of dosing or during recovery at doses of up to 500 mg/kg/dose BID in male rats and 175 mg/kg/dose BID in female rats as part of the GLP 28-day repeat- dose study.  
LOXO-305 had no effect on respiration rate in the dog at doses up to 10 mg/kg/dose BID. 
Targets of toxicity were characterized in  repeated -dose studies conducted in 2 relevant 
toxicity species. Certain targets (the hematopoietic and lymphoid systems) were found in both the rat and the dog. Rat- specific changes in the pancreas are species -specific and seen

contributing to moribundity in high-dose animals in the 28-day study. Doses evaluated in 
the 28-day dog study demonstrated a steep dose-response curve for toxicity and pronounced changes in hematologic parameters at high exposures. Additionally, in dogs treated for 3 months, 2 male dogs at 5 mg/kg BID (the highest dose tested) were observed to have eye lesions via both ophthalmic and microscopic examination. Findings were observed in both eyes of  these animals and consisted of very slight to slight multifocal or focal areas of corneal 
opacity in the center of the cornea along with constellation histopathological findings suggestive of minimal to mild corneal injury. The time of onset of these effects is unknown, as ophthalmic exams were only performed prior to the start of dosing and during the last week of the study; however, no eye effects were observed in the previous 28-day study. No ocular findings were observed in females. See the IB for addi tional details.

LOXO- 305 was not mutagenic in 2 bacterial reverse mutation assays and was negative in a 
non-GLP micronucleus assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells. LOXO -305 was positive for 
the induction of micronuclei via an aneugenic mechanism in the absence and presence of the 
exogenous metabolic activation system in a GLP in vitro micronucleus assay in human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, LOXO-305 was negative in a GLP in vivo micronucleus assay in rats at doses up to and including a dose of . The C

females.  
LOXO-305 was not found to be phototoxic when evaluated in an in vitro neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay. 
1.3. Potential for Drug -drug Interactions 
LOXO-305 showed no detectable inhibition (IC
50 > 60 µM) of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, and weak inhibition of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 in human 
liver microsomes. After pre -incub ation of microsomes with LOXO-305 and nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate prior to addition of CYP450 probe substrate, the CYP3A4 inhibitory potency of LOXO-305 was increased, suggesting the potential for time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Furthe r kinetic evaluation confirmed that LOXO -305 is a 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
In an in vitro hepatocyte assay, LOXO-305 induced messenger RNA (mRNA) for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19. For both CYP2B6 and CYP2C19, an increase in activity was seen. For CYP3A4, LOXO-305 did not cause an increase in activity, likely due to concurrent inhibition of CYP3A4 by LOXO-305. LOXO- 305 caused a decrease in mRNA for 
CYP1A2 but did not lead to a reduction of CYP1A2 activity. In the study, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9 mRNA were not induced. 
In vitro LOXO-305 inhibited P-glycoprotein (P- gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) 1, and MATE2K. LOXO-305 did not inhibit 
organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and weakly inhibited organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, OAT3, and bile salt exporter pump (BSEP).  
LOXO-305 is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. It is not a substrate of the hepatic transporters OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BSEP.

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 20 of 70 1.4. Summary of Clinical Experience  
LOXO-305 is currently being studied in an ongoing global Phase 1/2 first- in-human study, 
LOXO- BTK -18001 (the BRUIN Study), in patients with previously treated chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/ small lympho cytic lymphoma (SLL) or non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL). The starting dose of LOXO-305 was 25 mg QD.  
As of September 27, 2020, safety data were available from a total of 330 patients treated in 
the LOXO- BTK-18001 study. This includes 324 patients treated at doses ranging from 25 mg 
QD to  300 mg QD in Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, and 6 patients treated in Phase 1b 
Combination Arm A (LOXO-305 200 mg QD plus venetoclax 400 mg QD [after ramp -up] 
Section  1.4.1).  
As of September 30, 2020, PK data were available from 181 patients enrolled in the 
LOXO- BTK -18001 study ( Section  1.4.2).  
As of the date of this protocol, LOXO-305 had been recently investigated in 1 study in healthy volunteers (LOXO -BTK-20014), which was completed. LOXO- BTK-20014 was a 
pilot food-effect crossover study evaluating the effects of food and a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) on the PK of LOXO-305 where 10 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of 
LOXO-305 on 3 separate days, each followed by a washout period.  
As of the date of this protocol, 7 additional studies were ongoing in healthy volunteers and 
otherwise healthy volunteers with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (LOXO- BTK-20006, LOXO- BTK-20017, LOXO- BTK-20007, LOXO- BTK-20008, 
LOXO- BTK -20016, LOXO- BTK-20012, and LOXO- BTK-20011).

given 1 dose of 200 mg of LOXO -305, 12 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of 
LOXO-305 on 2 separate days (1 of which was co-administered with itraconazole), each followed by a washout period, and 12 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 
on 3 separate days (2 of which were co-administered with rifampin), each followed by a washout period.  
LOXO- BTK -20017 is a single ascending dose study evaluating the safety and tolerability of 
LOXO-305 at 300 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, and 900 mg doses, where, at the time of this

LOXO-305, 6 healthy volunteers were given a single dose of 600 mg LOXO -305, 6 healthy 
volunteers were given a single dose of 800 mg LOXO-305, and 6 healthy volunteers were 
given a single dose of 900 mg LOXO -305.  
LOXO- BTK -20007 is a 2-part study of the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and the 
absolute bioavailability of [
14C]-LOXO-305 where, at the time of this protocol’s 
development, 4 subjects were given a single oral dose of 200 mg of [14C]-LOXO-305 
(containing ~200 µCi) as an oral solution and 5 subjects were given a single oral dose of 
200 mg LOXO -305 as 2 × 100-mg tablets followed 2 hours later by a single dose of < 100 µg 
of [14C]-LOXO-305 (containing ~1  µCi of radioactivity [microtracer]) administered as an IV 
push over approximately 2 minutes.

1.4.1. Safety 
As of September 27, 2020, 330 patients were treated in the LOXO- BTK-18001 study and 
received LOXO -305. This includes 324 patients treated at doses ranging from 25 mg QD 
to 300 mg QD in Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, and 6 patients treated in Phase 1b 
Combination Arm A (LOXO-305 200 mg QD plus venetoclax 400 mg QD [after venetoclax ramp -up]). A full summary of treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for patients in the 
study is provided in the LOXO-305 IB and the Investigator is directed to the safety information described in that document.
1 A summary of safety for LOXO -305 given as 
monotherapy to patients in the LOXO- BTK-18001 study is provided below.  
• In the 324 patients in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, TEAEs reported in ≥ 10% of patients (n = 33 or more) were fatigue (20.1% total, 8.3% related), diarrhea (17.0% total, 8.6% related), and contusion (13.0% total, 9.0% related). Drug -related TEAEs 
were reported in 156 of 324 patients (48.1%) in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts. The most frequently reported drug- related TEAEs for LOXO -305 (those in >  5% of 
patients overall) were contusion (9.0%), diarrhea (8.6%), and fatigue (8.3%). All other drug- related TEAEs were reported in < 5% of patients (ie, <  17 patients each). 
Treatment -emergent AEs of severity Grade 3 or 4 were reported in 87 of 324 patients 
(26.9%) in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, with 41 (12.7%) of these Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported as related to study drug.  
On-study death (death within 28 days of the last dose of  study drug) due to a Grade 5 (fatal) 
AE was reported in 4 of 324 patients (1.2%) in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts . One 
Grade 5 AE, Enterococcus faecium- related septic shock, was considered to be related to 
study drug (further details are provided in the LOXO -305 IB

pleural effusion. 
Treatment -emerg ent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20014 study (headache, nausea, and vomiting), were all Grade 1 in 
severity and considered to be related to LOXO-305. All 3 events were reported by 1 subject 
and resolved within 1 to 1.5 days.  
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20006 study (intermittent belching, bloating, insect bite, aphthous ulcer, 
nausea, intermittent diarrhea [x2], muscle twitch),  were all Grade 1 in severity, and bloating, 
1 instance of intermittent diarrhea, and intermittent belching were considered to be related to 
LOXO-305 and rifampin. All 7 AEs were reported by 3 subjects and all events resolved prior to End of Treatment (EOT ; preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s 
development).  
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20017 study (headache [observed at the 300 mg LOXO -305 dose], and 
headache [x2] , intermittent headache, and petechial rash left thigh [observed at the 900 mg 
LOXO-305 dose]), were all Grade 1 in severity. One instance of headache observed at the 
300 mg LOXO -305 dose and 1 instance observed at the 900 mg LOXO -305 dose, the 
intermitten t headache, and the petechial rash left thigh were considered to be related to 
LOXO-305. All 5 AEs were reported by 4 subjects and resolved within 2 hours to 5 days of onset (preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s development).  
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in Part 1 of the LOXO- BTK -20007 study (bloody nose, headache, loose stool [x2], red 
bumps on left knee, small abrasion to right elbow), were all Grade 1 in severity and headache was considered to be related to LOXO -305. All 7 AEs were reported by 4 subjects and all 
events resolved within 1 to 2 days (preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s development).  
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in Part 2 of the LOXO- BTK -20007 study (tenderness at left venipuncture site [x2], bruising 
to left antecubital secondary to phlebotomy [x2], bruising to right antecubital secondary to 
phlebotomy, and allergic reaction), were all Grade 1 in severity and no events were considered to be related to LOXO-305. All 6 AEs were reported by 4 subjects and all events resolved within 1 to 2 days (preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s development).  
Treatment -emergent AEs rep orted following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20008 study (injection site pain, nasal congestion, flatulence, 
constipation, increased urinary frequency, facial rash, and sore right arm ), were all Grade 1 in 
severity, and flatulence, constipation, and increased urinary frequency were considered to be 
related to LOXO -305. All 7 AEs were reported by 3 subjects and all events resolved within 1 
to 8 days (preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s development).  
Adverse events reported following LOXO -305 administration in healthy volunteers in the 
LOXO- BTK -20016 study (petechiae [x4], back pain, nausea, constipation, bilateral leg 
cramps, facial acne, epigastric abdominal pain, and brain fog) were all Grade 1 in severit y,

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 23 of 70 and petechiae [x4], constipation, bilateral leg cramps, epigastric abdominal pain, and brain 
fog were considered to be related to LOXO -305. All 11 AEs were reported by 7 subjects and 
all events resolved within 1 to 11 days (preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s development). 
There have been no TEAEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy 
volunteers and volunteers with varying degrees of hepatic impairment in the LOXO- BTK -20012 study to date (preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s 
development). 
Adverse events reported following LOXO -305 administration in healthy volunteers in the 
LOXO- BTK -20011 study ( headache [ x4], dry mouth, rash [ various locations; x9], pyuria, 
bacteriuria,  intermittent left eye pain, lightheadedness, muscle twitch – right shoulder, 
diarrhea, slight tremor – left hand, constipation, and nausea) were all Grade 1 in severity. All 
23 TEAEs were reported by 10 subjects and all but 8 TEAEs of rash had resolved within 1 to 
9 days (preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s development).  
As part of each clinical trial conducted in patients or healthy volunteers, ECG and vital signs 
are performed at intervals specified by the protocol. For study LOXO -BTK -18001 conducted 
in patients, no clinically significant findings of QTc prolongation have been identified in 330 
patients as of September 27, 2020 (LOXO-305 IB
1). In addition, there have been no clinically 
significant abnormal findings in vital signs and ECG data in the studies investigating LOXO-305 conducted in healthy volunteers as of the date of this protocol (preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s development).  
1.4.2. Pharmacokinetics  
As of September 30, 2020, PK data were available from 181  patients enrolled in the 
LOXO- BTK -18001 study. Steady- state PK parameters of LOXO -305 in these cancer patients 
could be derived from data collected on Cycle 1 Day 8 ( Figure 1), and are shown in Table 1 . 
These data show that LOXO -305 is absorbed after oral administration with a median time to 
maximum observed plasma concentration (t
max) of approximately 2 hours and low clearance 
(Table 1 ). Due to the limited sampling interval (0 -8 hours), imputation for the 24-hour sample 
was made from Cycle 1 Day 8 predose sample, leading to an estimated plasma half -life of 
approximately 20 hours. Maximum observed plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) of LOXO-305 showed an increase proportional to dose 
(Figure 2 ). Following administration of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) 200 mg QD, 
mean trough plasma le vels of LOXO-305 exceeded the concentration required for 96% 
inhibition of BTK in vitro (IC
50 =  ng/mL, IC 96 =  ng/mL). Further details may be 
found in the IB.1 
Pharmacokinetic data following oral administration of a 200-mg dose of LOXO-305 in tablet 
form in healthy volunteers in the LOXO- BTK- 20014 study indicate that there was little effect 
of either a standard meal or the proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) on the PK of LOXO-305.

Preliminary and interim plasma concentration data from ongoing study LOXO- BTK-20008 
indicate that the dose of 200 mg QD in healthy volunteers produces a LOXO-305 steady- state 
geometric mean C max of  ng/mL and AUC from hour 0 to 24 hours postdose (AUC 0-24) 
of approximately  ng*h/mL. These results indicate that the dose of 200 mg QD in this 
study will provide exposure in the range of the RP2D of LOXO-305 seen in patients, while remaining well under the no observed adverse effect level C
max for genotoxicity of 
approximately  ng/mL.  
1.5. Study Rationale  
The objective of DDI studies is to determine whe ther potential interactions between an 
investigational drug and other drugs exist. Drug-drug interaction studies have an important role in drug development,
9 and this study is being perform ed as part of the development 
program for LOXO-305. 
In vitro LOXO-305 inhibited P- gp. LOXO -305 may have the potential to raise plasma 
concentrations of drugs that are substrates of P -gp. This study is designed to determine the 
effect of LOXO -305 on the PK of digoxin (P-gp substrate). Digoxin is a substrate for P-gp 
and P-gp efflux plays a major role in both the oral absorption and renal elimination of 
digoxin. Digoxin is commonly used as an index substrate for P-gp in DDI studies.9 
1.6. Risk Assessment  
Subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study. The risks of participation are primarily those  associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there may

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 27 of 70 also be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures. The 
dose of LOXO-305 administered in this study is not anticipated to induce any potential risk to subjects participating in this study as the dose does not exceed the highest dose safely administered in first -in-human study or healthy volunteer studies.

the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs associated with LOXO-305 may be found in the IB.

There is a potential risk that multiple doses of LOXO -305 may lead to decreases in white 
blood cells including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. Therefore, to mitigate any potential immunosuppressive risks during the ongoing SARS- CoV-2 
(COVID- 19) pandemic, subjects will remain in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for 
96 hours postdose (Day 20) to allow for LOXO-305 elimination. In addition, subject’s hematology laboratory results will be reviewed prior to discharge from the CRU. 
 
Digoxin is a natural cardiac glycoside indicated for the treatment of congestive heart failure that may also be used to treat atrial fibrillation. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window, 
and clinical toxicity can occur, particularly at plasma levels above the normal therapeutic 
range. Despite its narrow therapeutic range, digoxin is often used as a prob e substrate for 
P-gp in drug interaction studies as it is not metabolized by CYP450 enzymes; gut bacteria 
have been shown to inactivate digoxin.
10 Digoxin is a probe substrate for P-gp as listed by the 
FDA.11 The half-life of digoxin is approximately 1.5 to 2 days. The dose of digoxin chosen 
for this study, 0.25 mg, is well characterized. Adverse effects caused by digoxin toxicity are well characterized and easily monitored in the clinical setting, and these effects can be treated if required. To monitor for safety, serum digoxin levels will be measured daily  (Days 7 
through 15) in a clinical safety laboratory assay. These values are for safety only and will not 
be used to calculate the PK of digoxin. 
  
The safety monitoring practices employed will include AE reporting, vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examinations, and 
safety  monitoring of serum digoxin levels and are considered adequate to protect the 
subjects’ safety.

3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 1, open-label, fixed- sequence DDI study to investigate the effect of single and 
multiple oral doses of LOXO -305 on the PK of multiple oral doses of digoxin (P-gp 
substrate) in healthy subjects.  
On Day 1, subjects will be administered oral 0.25 mg digoxin BID (loading dose), once in the 
morning and evening. Subjects will be fasted for at least 2 hours predose and 1-hour postdose for the morning and evening dose.   
On Days 2 through 16, oral doses of 0.25 mg digoxin QD will be administered (total of 17 
consecutive doses) at the actual time of the Day 1 morning digoxin dose (± 1 hour). On 
Days  8 through 16 (9 consecutive doses), oral doses of 200 mg LOXO- 305 QD will be 
coadministered with 0.25 mg digoxin QD, at the actual time of the Day 1 morning digoxin dose (± 1 hour). LOXO-305 will be administered first, immediately followed by digoxin. On Days 2, 4 through 6, 9 through 11, 13, and 14, subjects will fast for at least 2 hours pre dose 
and 1-hour postdose. On Days 3, 12, and 15 where clinical laboratory evaluations are performed, subjects will fast for at least 8  hours predose and 1-hour postdose. On Days 7, 8, 
and 16, subjects will be fasted at least 10  hours predose and 2 hours postdose. Blood and 
urine samples for concentrations of digoxin in plasma and urine and
 
 Blood samples for concentrations of LOXO-305 and digoxin in plasma and  
 
 Urine samples for concentrations of digoxin and  
 
  Samples collected for the analysis of plasma and urine concentrations of digoxin 
and for analysis of LOXO-305 in plasma  may be stored and analyzed  
 
The schematic of the study design is displayed in Figure 3. The start of the study is defined as 
the date the first subject who is enrolled in the study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects who are assigned to receive a dose of 
study drug; this definition excludes screen failure subjects. Replacement subjects may be 
enrolled only if deemed necessary by the Sponsor. 
Subjects who are determined to be screen failures are permitted to be re -screened if the 
Investigator (or designee), with agreement from the Sponsor, feels that the subject may meet 
eligibility criteria upon re -screen. Re -screened subjects will be provided a new subject 
number. 
To assess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28  days 
(Days  -29 to -2) and be admitted to the CRU on Day -1 (Check- in). 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the ti me of Check -in (Day  -1) until EOT on 
Day 20 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early Termination (ET) if the 
subject discontinues. Dosing of digoxin will occur on Days 1 through 16 and dosing of 
LOXO-305 will occur on Days 8 through 16. A follow -up phone call will occur for all

early) 7  days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET. The duration of participation is expected to be 
approximately 58 days (Screening th rough follow-up phone call). 
Figure  3: Study Schematic  
 
In this study, physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, vital sign measurements, How Do You 
Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation parameters, hematology panel, urinalysis (UA; Appendix 2), safety  monitoring of serum digoxin levels , and recording 
of concomitant medications will be performed at specified times during the study (for specific timepoints and details on each study variable, refer to Appendix 4).  
Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow- up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as 
beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) 
or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration 
on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call) are to be reported. 
A Schedule of Assessments is presented in Appendix 4. Study completion is defined as the 
time of the last subject’s follow -up phone call.

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 31 of 70 3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
Metabolic routes of absorption or elimination, including most of thos e occurring through 
P-gp, can be inhibited or induced by concomitant drug treatment. Changes arising from 
metabolic DDI can be significant and contribute to increases or decreases in the blood and tissue concentrations of the parent drug or active metaboli te. Increased or decreased 
concentrations of a parent drug or its metabolites can alter the safety and efficacy profile of a drug.  
Digoxin is a well- established P -gp substrate and is used as a probe to assess the P -gp 
modulating potential of other drugs. The effect of LOXO -305 on the PK of digoxin will be 
assessed following multiple doses of digoxin due to the non-linearity of digoxin PK at single 
doses.  Urinary digoxin PK will also be assessed because P -gp is expressed in proximal 
tubular cells of the kidney, and any effect of LOXO-305 on P- gp may therefore influence the 
renal clearance of digoxin. The fixed single- sequence design used in this study is typical for 
drug interaction studies because it allows intra- subject comparisons. A single sequence will 
be used to avoid carry-over effects. This study will be open- label because the primary 
endpoints are not considered subjective. 
Conducting the study in healthy adult subjects mitigates the potential confounding effects of 
the disease state and concomitant medications. 
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
3.3.1. LOXO -305 
Multiple oral doses of 200 mg LOXO -305 QD will be administered on Days 8 through 
Day 16 to achieve LOXO- 305 steady state, ensuring the maximal effect of LOXO -305 when 
the effect on the PK of digoxin is determined on Day 16. While doses of 25 mg QD to 
300 mg QD have been evaluated, LOXO-305 200 mg given QD has been chosen as the RP2D for the ongoing global Phase 1/2 first -in-human study, LOXO- BTK -18001 in patients 
with previously treated CLL/SLL or NHL. T he available data demonstrate that LOXO -305 
appears safe and well tolerated at these doses. At all evaluated doses, no dose- limiting 
toxicities have been identified in humans.
1  
3.3.2. Digoxin 
The selected d ose of digoxin is based on typical doses for this drug when used as an index 
substrate in DDI studies and is considered to be high enough to provide sufficient plasma concentrations to achieve the objectives of the study.  Following the initial loading dose and 
given a t
1/2 of approximately 1.5 days, digoxin plasma concentrations would be expected to 
achieve steady -state by Day 7 in the absence of LOXO-305. Day 7 has therefore been 
selected for the steady -state digoxin PK sampling and Day 8 has been chosen f or the first 
LOXO-305 coadministration. Subjects may be withdrawn if their trough serum digoxin level 
exceeds 2.0 ng/mL and/or they exhibit clinically significant signs or symptoms of digoxin toxicity.

4.5. Subject Number and Identification 
Subject numbers will consist of 6 digits in which the first set of 3 digits will identify the site and the second set of 3 digits will identify the subject (eg, 001 -101).  
For subjects who are withdrawn by the Investigator (or designee) or voluntarily withdraw prematurely from the study, replacement subjects will be enrolled only if deemed necessary by the Sponsor.  
If necessary, as determined by the Sponsor, subjects who fail to complete the treatment or 
have insufficient PK data may be replaced. Replacement subjects will be assigned a subject number by adding 200 to the last 3 digits of the subject number for the subject they are replacing (eg, Subject Number 001-301 replaces Subject Number 001-101). 
Subjects who are determined to be screen failures are permitted to be re -screened if the 
Investigator (or designee), with agreement from the Sponsor, feels that the subject may meet 
eligibility criteria upon re -screen. Re -screened subjects will be provided a new subject 
number as defined above. 
4.6. Removal of Subjects from Study Participation  
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for 
any reason. The Investigator (or designee) may remove a subject from the study if, in the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) opinion, it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue the study. Subjects may be withdrawn because of the following:

additional 100 mL of water may be administered if needed.  
Each unit dose will be prepared by qualified CRU staff.  
Appropriate unit dose(s), as described above, will be administered to subjects. Although the 
timing of events requires that each subject will be administered the appropriate dose at a specific time, the exact dose time of subjects may be staggered to obviate the need to have all 
subjects on precisely the same study schedule. For each dose, the subject’s actual dose time will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed into the eCRF. 
Subjects will be instructed not to crush, split, or chew the study drugs. Subjects will not lay supine for 4 hours following LOXO-305 and digoxin dose 
administration, except as necessitated by the occurrence of an AE(s) and/or study procedure(s).

5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance: 
• All doses will be administered under the su pervision of suitably qualified CRU staff.  
• Immediately after oral dose administration, a visual inspection of the mouth and 
hands will be performed for each subject.  
• At each dose preparation occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of LOXO-305 
and digoxin will be performed.  
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The Investigator (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of LOXO -305 
and digoxin tablets received . In addition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, 
specifying the amount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensing. This drug accountability record will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original drug accountability record will be available for review by the Sponsor upon request.

7.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.1.1. Pharmacokinetic Blood Sample Collection and Processing  
Blood samples for PK analysis of digoxin, LOXO -305, and for future potential and/or 
exploratory analysis will be collected at the timepoints specified in Appendix 4. The exact 
time of the study drug administration and the actual time of blood sampling for PK and for 
future potential and/or exploratory analysis will be recorded on the eCRF. 
Processing, storage, and shipping instructions for these PK blood samples and for future 
potential and/or exploratory analysis will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual . The 
number of blood samples and total blood volume required for PK and for future potential 
and/or exploratory analysis testing is presented in Appendix 3. 
7.1.2. Pharmacokinetic Urine Sample Collection and Processing  
Urine samples for PK analysis of digoxin levels will be collected at the timepoints specified in Appendix 4. The exact time of the study drug a dministration and the actual time of urine 
sampling for PK analysis will be recorded on the eCRF. Samples collected for the analysis of urine concentrations of digoxin may be stored and analyzed for future exploratory analysis. 
Processing, storage, and shi pping instructions for these PK urine samples will be provided in 
a separate Laboratory Manual .  
7.1.3. Analytical Methodology 
Plasma concentrations of digoxin and LOXO-305 and urine concentrations of digoxin will be determined using validated bioanalytical methods. Specifics of the bioanalytical methods will be provided in a separate document. 
7.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety evaluations may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee) or 
Sponsor. 
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures in accordance with the 
nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, and any other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. The order of pri ority for 
scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in order of priority): 
• dosing 
• PK blood sampling 
• vital sign measurements*  
• 12-lead ECGs*  
• blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory evaluations 
• physical examination.

Covance Study: 8456071  Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20021 
Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 47 of 70 * When vital sign measurements and 12- lead ECGs are scheduled at the same time as PK 
blood sampling, the PK blood sampling will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the 
vital sign measurements followed by 12- lead ECGs will be obtained prior to and as close as 
possible to the sched uled PK blood sampling. 
7.2.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions; assignment of severity, causality, action taken, and outcome; and procedures for reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1. 
Subjects will be asked a non- leading HDYF? question such as “Have there been any changes 
in your health status since Screening/since you were last asked?” at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4 (ie, at Screening [after the ICF is signed], at Check -in [Day  -1], at each 
postdose vital sign measurement, and at an appropriate time for all other days). Subjects will also be encouraged to voluntarily report AEs occurring at any other time through the EOS. 
Adverse events, whether volunteered, i dentified by the subject’s responses to HDYF? 
inquiries, or noted on physical examination, ECG, vital sign measurements, or clinical 
laboratory evaluations, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until EOS [or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a 
follow-up phone call]), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. Al l SAEs that develop from the time of ICF 
signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call) are to be reported. 
Unless a subject withdraws consent or is withdrawn from the study and does not c omplete the 
follow-up phone call, all subjects must be followed until EOS. Subjects with AEs that are 
assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) which are ongoing at EOS may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by the Investigator (or designee) and confirmed by the Sponsor. The Investigator (or designee) should use appropriate judgment in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the resolution of events. The Sponsor may request that additional safety tests be performed.  
Subjects will receive a follow-up phone call 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET to determine 
if any SAE or drug- related AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit.  
At all times, a subject may b e required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of 
the Investigator (or designee).  
Any event that meets the criteria of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to CRU policy 
by the Investigator (or designee) and to regulatory authorities by the Sponsor (or Sponsor

day before EOT, subjects are not required to be fasted prior to clinical laboratory evaluations], coagulation parameters, hematology panel, TSH [Screening only], HbA1c [Screening only], eGFR [Screening and Check- in (Day -1)], and UA) will be collected at the 
timepoints specified in  Appendix 4. 
Screens for HCV antibody, HBsAg, HBV IgM core antibody, and HIV antibody will be performed at Screening.  
Testing for COVID -19 via PCR (or equivalent) will be performed at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4. Testing for COVID-19 may also be conducted periodically during the 
subject’s CRU confinement, at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee). Further details regarding COVID -19 testing (including procedures for subjects who test positive at any time 
throughout CRU confinement) are specifi ed in a separate document.  
A urine drug screen for selected drugs of abuse (including cotinine) and an alcohol screen (urine or breath) will be performed at Screening and repeated at Check -in (Day  -1) for all 
subjects. A serum qualitative or urine qualitat ive pregnancy test (female subjects only 
[quantitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin tests may be used for confirmation as needed and post -menopausal  subjects may be eligible for participation if the results of the 
qualitative serum pregnancy or quali tative urine pregnancy  test are positive but the 
quantitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin results are within the laboratory’s reference ranges for post -menopausal women]) and an FSH test (post- menopausal female 
subjects only) will be performed at th e timepoints specified in Appendix 4. 
The number of blood samples and total blood volume required for clinical laboratory evaluations are presented in Appendix 3. A list of the specific evaluations is in  Appendix 2. 
7.2.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements (including body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and supine BP and pulse rate) will be obtained at the timepoints speci fied in  Appendix 4. 
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be performed using the same arm for each reading and measurements should be taken after the subject has been resting in the supine position for a t least 5  minutes. 
When vital sign measurements are scheduled at the same time as PK blood draws, the PK blood draws will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital sign measurements will be obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled PK blood draw. 
7.2.4. 12-lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG (including HR, PR, RR, QRS, and QT interval parameters) will be obtained 
after the subject has been resting for at least 10  minutes in the supine position at the

(QTcF  = QT/[RR]1/3) formula.  
When 12- lead ECGs are scheduled at the same time as PK blood draws, the PK blood draws 
will be obtained at the scheduled timep oint, and the 12- lead ECGs will be obtained prior to 
and as close as possible to the scheduled PK blood draw.  
7.2.5. Physical Examination  
A complete or abbreviated physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4. Complete physical examinations will evaluate general appearance and the 
following body systems/organs: dermatological; head and eyes; ears, nose, mouth, and throat; pulmonary; cardiovascular; abdominal; lymphatic; musculoskeletal/extremities; and neurological. Weight and height will be reported (height only reported during Screening). Abbreviated physical examinations will evaluate general appearance and the following body systems/organs: dermatological; pulmonary; cardiovascular; ab dominal; and neurological. 
7.2.6. Safety Digoxin Monitoring  
Therapeutic drug monitoring of digoxin concentrations (trough levels) in serum will be 
performed before the digoxin dose  at the timepoints specified in Appendix 4. The results will 
be made available to the Investigator prior to digoxin dosing the following day. The Investigator must review the results prior to administration of the next digoxin dose.  
Additional serum digoxin samples for safety monitoring  may be col lected at the discretion of 
the Investigator. If a subject's trough serum digoxin level exceeds 2.0 ng/mL and/or they exhibit clinically  significant signs or symptoms of digoxin toxicity, that subject may be discontinued from the study. Results of the s erum digoxin samples collected for safety 
monitoring will not be included in the PK evaluation of digoxin. 
Any subject experiencing signs of acute severe digoxin toxicity will be managed appropriately, including, if indicated, urgent transport to a local eme rgency room.

Covance Study: 8456071  Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20021 
Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 51 of 70 Samples collected for the analysis of plasma and urine concentrations of digoxin and for 
analysis of LOXO-305 in plasma may be stored and analyzed for future exploratory analysis. 
Whenever possible, the following PK parameters for digoxin and LOXO-305 will be 
calculated for each subject based on the plasma concentrations (as appropriate):  
• area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from hour 0 to 24 hours postdose (AUC
0-24) 
• AUC from hour  0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0-t) 
• AUC during a dosing interval (AUC tau) 
• apparent systemic clearance (CL/F)  
• Cmax 
• mean residence time (MRT)  
• time to maximum observed plasma concentration (t max) 
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the urine concentrations of digoxin: 
• amount of drug excreted unchanged in urine (A
e) 
• fraction of drug excreted unchanged in urine (F e) 
• renal clearance (CLr)  
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed using commercial software such as Phoenix™ 
WinNonlin® Version  8.1 or higher (Certara USA Inc.).  
Other parameters may be added as appropriate. Final PK parameters reported will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as recorded on the eCRF. All statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS
 Version  9.4 or greater. More details on the analyses 
will be included in the SAP.  
8.3.1. Descriptive Analysis  
Plasma and urine concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics (number, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of varia tion [CV%], 
geometric mean, geometric CV%, median, minimum, and maximum). 
Individual and mean plasma and urine concentration- time curves (both linear and log linear) 
will be included in the final report.  
8.3.2. Statistical Methodology  
The primary analysis planned for this study is a mixed effect model that includes treatment as 
a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. The analysis will be performed on the natural 
log (ln)- transformed PK parameters (AUC 0-t, AUC 0-24, and C max) and include calculation of

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 52 of 70 least squared (LS) means and the difference between treatment LS  means, as well as their 
corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs). The geometric mean ratios and their 90% CIs 
of the PK parameter for each treatment comparison will be constructed using the exponentiation of the difference and the CIs from the mixed effect model. The comparisons of interest will be as follows: 
• Multiple doses of digoxin coadministered with multiple doses of LOXO-305 versus multiple doses of digoxin alone. 
• Multiple doses of digoxin coadministered with a single dose of LOXO-305 versus multiple doses of digoxin alone.
  
8.4. Safety Analysis 
All safety assessments, including AEs, SAEs, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory 
results, safety monitoring of serum digoxin levels, physical examination results, concomitant 
medications, and 12- lead ECGs, will be tabulated and summarized where possible, using 
descriptive methodology by treatment, as needed, by timepoint. Unless otherwise specified, 
baseline value is defined as the last non -missing measurement before administration of study 
drug on Day 1. No formal statistical analyses are planned for the safety data. All safety data will be listed by subject.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary (WHO Drug Global B3, September 2019). Adverse events will be coded using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA) Version 22.1 (or higher). The 
incidence of AEs will be presented by severity and by relationship to study drug as determ ined by the Investigator or designee ( Appendix 1 for AE reporting). All TEAEs will be 
summarized by system organ class and preferred term.  
8.5. Data Handling and Record Keeping  
Any changes to information in the trial pr ogress notes and other source documents will be 
initialed and dated on the day the change is made by a CRU staff member authorized to make the change. Changes will be made by striking a single line through erroneous data and clearly entering the correct da ta (eg, wrong data right data). If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written adjacent to the change by the CRU staff member.  
The Data Management Plan will be approved by the Sponsor. 
Data will be validate d during data entry by the CRU and verified by the Study Monitor. Data 
will then be reviewed by the data management group to resolve any outstanding issues. 
Listings will be generated after the database is cleaned by data management and will be reviewed by the Covance scientific team. The eCRF and ancillary data will be converted into final SAS
® datasets following Study Data Tabulation Model or Sponsor-provided 
specifications. The final datasets structure will be verified using Web Submission Data Manager
®, while the dataset content will be peer  reviewed by an independent programmer.

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 59 of 70 Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE; or adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
experienced by a patient or healthy adult subject, whether or not considered drug-related by the Investigator (or designee). A treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE that 
starts on or after the first administration of study drug. 
The following are all AEs: 
• unfavorable changes in general condition 
• subjective or objec tive signs/symptoms  
• concomitant diseases or accidents  
• clinically significant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject 
during a clinical study  
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective disease symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities that are deemed clinically significant by the Investigator [or designee]), and accidents observed in the context of a clinical trial, irrespective of a possible causal relationship with the administratio n of the trial substance. 
Categorization of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs will be categorized based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows: 
• Grade  1 Mild:  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade  2 Moderate:  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*  
• Grade  3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening:  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**  
• Grade  4 Life -threatening consequences:  An event that puts the subject at 
immediate risk of death  
• Grade  5: Death rela ted to AE  
Note: Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade selection. Grade 5 (death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries, or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden. 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8456071  Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20021 
Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 60 of 70 The Investigator (or des ignee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2-category system according to the following guidelines: 
• NOT RELATED = The time course between the administration of investigational 
product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) is suspected  
• RELATED = The time course between administration of investigational product and the occurrence or worsening of t he AE is consistent with a causal relationship 
and no other cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) can be identified  
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may h ave been caused by the drug. 
Pregnancy 
As information is available, a pregnancy (including pregnancy in female partners of male subjects) diagnosed through End of Study (EOS) or Early Termination (ET; if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call)
 and for up to 
90 days after study drug administration on Day 16 (or last administration of study drug if subject terminates from the study early) should be reported by the Investigator (or designee) via email to Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24 hours of being notified. Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will then forward the Pregnancy Form to the Investigator (or designee) for completion. 
email: SAEIntake@Covance.com 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the 
study and ET study procedures will be performed. The subject or partner should be followed by the Investigator (or designee) until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator (or designee) should notify Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator (or designee) will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious adverse event (SAE; ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator (or designee) should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
Male subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator (or designee) immediately if they 
discover their sexual partner is pregnant. In this instance, the partner must provide written consent before pregnancy information can be collected. When a Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU) becomes aware that the female partner of a male subject is pregnant, they are to contact the Investigator (or designee) immediately (within 24  hours of the CRU staff 
becoming aware of the event) in addition to notifying Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative via email.  
All pregnancies should be recorded on the AE electronic Case Report Form (eCRF; as appropriate), in addition to completion of the required pregnancy forms. If the Investigator (or designee) suspects that a pregnancy was the result of an interaction between the study

Protocol Version  1.0, 12 February 2021 Page 61 of 70 treatment and the contraceptive method, in addition to the pregnancy the drug interaction 
should also be captured as a separate AE.  
Defini tion of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience (ie, one that pl aces the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator [or designee], at immediate risk of death) 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• An import ant medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the above outcomes 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘u nexpected’ if the event is not listed 
in the Reference Safety Information section of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or if it is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed for an unapproved investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
Reporting 
The FDA -reportable AEs are AEs that are associated with the use of the drug and represent 
events that are assessed as serious, related, and unexpected. The FDA -reportable AEs will be 
reported by the CRU to the Sponsor and the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB). Final determination of whether an event represents a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) will be the responsibility of the Sponsor.  
Within 24 hours of when an AE that is potentially FDA- reportable is first recognized or 
reported, and within 24 hours of any SAE (regardless of whether the event is assessed as 
related or unrelated to study drug) being first recognized or reported, Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will be notified by the Investiga tor (or designee) in 
writing using the following email address: 
email: SAEIntake@Covance.com 
To report the SAE, the completed report form should be sent by email to Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24 hours of awareness. Incom ing reports are

Form are provided in the Study Manual. 
The IRB will be notified of any FDA- reportable AE within the timeframe required by the 
IRB. The IRB Serious a nd Unexpected Adverse Experience Submission Form will be 
completed and submitted with the copy of the written confirmation or summary of the AE.

a. For details on study procedures, see Section  7. 
b. Interim medical history only.  
c. Height collected at Screening only; BMI calculated based on Screening height . 
d. A complete physical examination will be performed at Check-in (Day -1). An abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Day 20 (EOT) or at ET.  
e. 12-lead ECGs will be obtained at Screening and Check -in (Day  -1), Day  1 (predose and 2 hours postdose), once daily on Days 2 to 7 (predose), Day  8 (predose and 2 hours postdose), 
Days  10, 12, and 15 (predose), Day 16 (predose and 2 hours postdose), Day 18, and Day 20 (96 hours postdose on Day 16 [EOT]) or ET. 12- lead ECGs will be collected after the subject has 
rested in the supine position for at least 10  minutes. When scheduled at the same time as PK blood draws, 12-lead ECGs will be obtained prior to and as  close as possible to having blood 
drawn. The allowed sampling window for 12- lead ECGs is ± 30 minutes from the nominal timepoint for all postdose 12-lead ECGs and no less than 10 minutes prior to dosing for predose 
12-lead ECGs.  
f. Vital sign measurements (supine BP and pulse rate) will be obtained at Screening, Check-in (Day  -1), Day  1 (predose and 2 hours postdose), once daily on Days 2 to 7 (predose), Day  8 
(predose and 2  hours postdose), Days 10, 12, and 15 (predose), Day 16 (predose and 2 hours postdose), Day 18, and Day 20 (96 hours postdose on Day 16 [EOT]) or ET. Blood pressure and 
pulse rate will be measured using the same arm for each reading after the subject has been supine for at least 5  minutes. When scheduled at the same time as PK blood draws, vital sign 
measurements should be carried out prior to and as close as possible to having blood drawn. The allowed sampling window for vital sign measurements is ±  30 minutes from the nominal 
timepoint for all postdose vital sign measurements and no less than 10 minutes prior to dosing for predose vital sign measurements.  
g. Respiratory rate and body temperature will be obtained at Screening, Check-in (Day -1), and Day 20 (96 hours postdose on Day 16 [EOT]) or ET. 
h. Oxygen saturation will be measured via pulse oximetry at Screening, Check-in (Day -1), predose on Day 1, and Day 20 (96  hours postdose on Day 16 [EOT]) or ET. The allowed sampling 
window for oxygen saturation measurements is ± 30 minutes from the nominal timepoint for all postdose oxygen saturation measurements and no less than 10  minutes prior to dosing for 
predose oxygen saturation measurements.  
i. A HDYF? inquiry will be performed at Screening (after the ICF is signed), at Check-in (Day -1), at each postdose vital sign measurement, and at an appropria te time for all other days.  
j. Adverse events and SAEs will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study  (ie, from signing of the ICF until EOS, or until ET if the 
subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the 
event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the 
ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed by the Investigator [or designee]) as related to study procedures, or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug are to be recorded. All SAEs that develop from 
the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up phone call) are to be reported.  
k. On Day  1, oral doses of 0.25  mg digoxin BID (loading dose) will be administered once in the morning and evening. Subjects will be fasted for at least 2 hours predose and 1-hour postdose 
for the morning and evening dose. Water will be restricted for 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing with the exception of water administered for dose admini stration. On Days 2 through 16, 
oral doses of 0.25 mg digoxin  QD will be administered at the actual time of the Day 1 morning digoxin dose (± 1 hour). On Days 8 through 16, oral doses of 200 mg LOXO-305 QD will be 
coadministered with oral doses of 0.25  mg digoxin QD, at the actual time of the Day 1 morning digoxin dose (± 1 hour). LOXO-305 will be administered first, immediately followed by 
digoxin. On Days 2 , 4 through 6, 9 through 11, 13, and 14, subjects will fast for at least 2  hours predose and 1 -hour postdose. On Days 3, 12, and 15 where clinical laboratory evaluations are

restricted for 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing with the exception of water administered for dose administration.  
l. On Day 8 through Day 16, oral doses of 200 mg LOXO-305 QD will be coadministered with oral doses of 0.25  mg digoxin QD  in the morning at the actual time of the Day 1 morning 
digoxin dose (±  1 hour). LOXO-305 will be administered first, immediately followed by digoxin. On Days 2 , 4 through 6, 9 through 11, 13, and 14 , subjects will fast for at least 2 hours 
predose and 1-hour postdose. On Days 3, 12, and 15 where clinical laboratory evaluations are performed, subjects will fast for at least 8 hours predose and 1-hour postdose. On Days 7, 8 and 
16, subjects will be fasted at least 10 hours predose and 2 hours postdose. Water will be restricted for 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing with the  exception of water administered for dose 
administration. 
p. Clin
ical chemistry panel (fasted for at least 8  hours), coagulation parameters, hematology panel, and UA will be performed  at Screening, Check -in (Day -1), Day 3 (48 hours postdose 
on Day 1), Day  7 (predose), Day 12 (predose), Day  15 (predose), and Day 19 (72  hours postdose on Day 16, if the subject completes the study [EOT]), or on the day of ET. At ET or the day 
before EOT (Day 19), subjects are not required to be fasted prior to clinical laboratory evaluations.  
q. Serum digoxin level  samples for safety monitoring will be collected predose on Days 7 through 15 and at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee).  
r. Testing for COVID-19 will be conducted at a minimum at Screen ing and Check -in (Day -1). Testing for COVID-19 may also be conducted periodically during the subject’s CRU 
confinement, at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee). Tests will be performed by rapid polymerase chain reaction or equivalent.  
s. Urine drug screen for selected drugs of abuse (including cotinine) and alcohol screen (urine or breath).  
t. Prior and concomitant medication administration will be recorded beginning at informed consent. In addition, all Investigator-approved prescription and over-the- counter medications taken 
by a subject within 14 days or 5 half -lives (if known), whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 will be recorded on the subject’s electronic CRF.  
u. Female subjects only. Performed at Screening, Check -in (Day -1), and Day 19 (72  hours postdose on Day 16), if the subject completes the study (EOT) or on the day of ET.  
v. Post-menopausal female subjects only.  
w. End of Treatment is defined as when the subject is released from the CRU following completion of all assessments through Day  20. Early Termination is defined as when the subject is 
released from the CRU if the subject terminates the study early. Vital sign measurements, ECG, and abbreviated physical examination results are to be available for review by the Investigator  
(or designee) prior to subject release from the CRU on Day 20 (EOT) or ET.  Clinical laboratory results (for clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and UA) and serum pregnancy test 
results (female subjects only) are to be available for review by the Investigator (or designee) prior to subject release from the CRU at the EOT visit and prior to subject release from the CRU 
at the ET visit if available.  
x. To be conducted 7 days (±  2 days) following EOT or ET. End of Study is defined as when the subject is contacted by the CRU for a follow -up phone call 7 days (±  2 days) after the EOT visit 
or ET visit to determine if any SAE or study drug-related AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit. All subjects who received LOXO -305 or digoxin (including subjects who are terminated 
early) will receive a follow -up phone call.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March  2022  7 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 1  SUMMARY OF CHANGES TABLE 
Amendment 1 (17 March  2022) 
This amendment is considered substantial / based on the criteria defined in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union because it significantly impacts the safety of participants or the 
scientific  value of the study . 
Overall rationale for the current Amendment:   
This protocol has been amended to reflect the following:  
• Following  review of data collected so far from the RSV MAT -009 study in pregnant 
women, safety signals have been identified. An imba lance in the proportion of 
preterm births and neonatal deaths have been observed in infants born to vaccinated 
mothers who received RSV maternal vaccine versus those who received a placebo. 
The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this ti me a cause has not 
been determined, based on the above observations, GSK has nevertheless decided to 
stop enrolment and vaccination for all actively enrolling RSV MAT studies.  
• There will be no new participants included in this study . However, safety monitoring 
of all 8 study participants  (of the planned 252 study participants)  enrolled and 
vaccinated  in RSV MAT -039 study in a study site in the US will continue  during the 
rest of the study period.  
• The vaccination planned at visit 2 is removed. Therefor e, Contact 2  at Day 38  and 
Visit 3 at Day 61 are not applicable anymore. Visit 4a (Day 181) and Visit 4b (Day 
211) are replaced by a telephone contact at Day 181 .  
• A blood sample for immunogenicity assessment in the study participants who 
received first dose of RSV Maternal vaccine will continue to be collected  at Visit 2 
only. No other blood samples will be collected.  
• All planned objectives will be analysed and reported in a descriptive manner for the 
8 enrolled participants .

17 March  2022  15 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  (Amended 17 March  2022) 
Rationale:   
GSK is developing an investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) maternal vaccine 
(RSVPreF3) against RSV disease in infants through maternal immunization . This study is 
a Phase 3 study to evaluate safety, reactogenicity , and immunogenicity  of RSV maternal 
vaccine in non -pregnant girls 9 to17 years of age ( YOA) (pediatric study group*) and in 
non-pregnant adult women 18 to 49 YOA (adult study group).   
* For purpose of this study we will classify all females between 9 -17 YOA as “girls” with 
the understanding that this age range includes children (9-11 year of age)  and 
adolescents: (12 to 18 [further dependent on the region]).  [ICH E11, 2017] 
Objectives and endpoints/estimands  of the RSV MAT -039 study are presented in  Table 3. 
1.2. Schema  (Amended 17 March  2022) 
This is a phase 3 study to evaluate safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity  of 
RSV maternal vaccine in healthy non -pregnant girls 9 -17 YOA (pediatri c study group) 
and in non-pregnant adult women 18 -49 YOA (adult study  group). 
A total of 252 participants  will be enrolled in the study (126 in each age group) . Each 
group will be further sub -divided into two  groups (63 each), of which one  will receive 
RSV maternal vaccine followed by  dTpa (Boostrix) vaccine 30 days later and the other 
subgroup will receive dTpa vaccine followed by RSV maternal vaccine 30 days later . The 
randomization will ensure the following : 
• Approximately 63, 9-17 YOA participants in the RSV_dTpa -P group 
• Approximately 63, 9-17 YOA participants in the dTpa_RSV -P group 
• Approximately 63, 18-49 YOA participants in the RSV_dTpa -A group 
• Approximately 63, 18-49 YOA participants  in the dTpa_RSV -A group 
Blood samples for humoral immunogenicity will be collected from all participants  prior 
to RSV maternal vaccine administration , Day 31 post RSV maternal vaccine 
administration , and Day 181 post RSV maternal vaccine administration . (See Section 4.1 
for details) . 
Based on all safety information  available from RSV MAT -009 study  (following  
administration of  RSV MAT vaccine ), there will be no further enrollment and 
vaccination of participants  in this study .  
There will be no more blood samples collected as part of this study , except the study 
participant s who has received RSV maternal vaccine at Visit 1 . A blood sample  will be 
collected and a urine pregnancy test  will continue to be performed  for them at Visit 2.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March  2022  16 Participants who are enrolled and are due to receive dTpa during their Visit 2 will no 
longer receive the dTpa as part of this study . However, as per the local standard of care 
and or immunization recommendation and after consultation with their attending 
physician ; the participant ca n always receive any commercially available dTpa vaccine . 
GSK will bear the cost of the vaccine.  
All participants who receive the first dose of  study intervention s (RSV maternal vaccine 
or dTpa) will be followed for safety and reactogenicity and evaluated for  both solicited 
administration site (local) and systemic events within 7 days of vaccination, unsolicited 
AEs within 30 days of vaccination,  SAEs and pregnancy outcomes throughout the study 
period (180 days after first dose of  study interventions ). 
All safety data will be reviewed by  a Safety Review Team (SRT) and  an independent data 
monitoring committee  (IDMC). (See Section 8.2.3 for more details)

2. INTRODUCTION  (AMENDED 17 MARCH  2022) 
2.1. Study rationale  
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA ( GSK) is developing an investigational respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) maternal vaccine (RSVPreF3) against RSV disease in infants 
through maternal immunization with the aim of preventing RSV -associated lower 
respiratory tract illnesses in their infants by transf er of maternal antibodies. The vaccine 
candidate is an engineered version of the RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein, stabilized 
in the pre -fusion conformation. This study will be a Phase 3 randomized, open  label, 
active vaccine -controlled crossover study to the evaluate safety, reactogenicity , and 
immunogenicity  of RSV maternal vaccine in healthy non -pregnant adolescent girls from 
9 to 17 years of age (YOA), and in non-pregnant adult women from 18 to 49 YOA.  The 
lower age cut -off is set as 9 years of age corresponding to the earliest onset of puberty in 
girls per ICH E11 guideline . 
The RSV maternal vaccine was being developed by GSK to be administered to pregnant 
women. By including pregnant adolescents in the target population for v accination, their 
infants were expected to be protected from RSV for first 6 months of life thus increasing 
the number of infants who can benefit from this vaccine. RSV prevention is even more 
crucial in this population as babies of adolescent mothers face  higher risks of low birth 
weight, preterm delivery , and severe neonatal conditions [WHO, 2016]. Hence these 
babies also have a higher risk of developing severe RSV disea se [CHMP, 2018] which 
justifies the need to vaccinate the pregnant adolescent population  with maternal RSV  
vaccine. 
Because it is not feasible to conduct a study including all age groups of pregnant 
adolescents due to the low occurrence of young adolescent pregnancies this study is 
conducted in non -pregnant girls including a direct comparison to non -pregnant adult 
women in terms of immunological non -inferiority. RS V MAT-039 is part of an approved 
Pediatric Investigation Plan in Europe.  
In the RSV maternal program to date, a Phase 1/2 study (RSV MAT -001; NCT 
03674177) in healthy non -pregnant women 18 -45 years of age to determine the safety 
and immunogenicity of 3 dos e levels of RSV (RSVPreF3) maternal vaccine (30, 60 and 
120 µg) compared to placebo has been completed. No safety concerns have been 
identified.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  21 Based on preliminary results of RSV MAT -001, the 60 and 120 µg dose -levels were 
selected for further evaluatio n in the following 2 additional studies, which are ongoing:  
• RSV-MAT 004 (NCT 04126213): A Phase II observer -blind study to assess safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals’ investigational RSV 
maternal unadjuvanted vaccine (GSK3888550A ), in healthy pregnant women and 
infants born to vaccinated mothers  
• RSV-MAT 011 (NCT 04138056): A Phase II study of 2 dose levels of an 
investigational RSV maternal vaccine, given alone or with dTpa, to healthy non -
pregnant wo men to assess safety, reactoge nicity, and immunogenicity.  
The 120-µg dose has demonstrated robust immunogenicity and there were no safety 
concerns. It was, therefore, selected for evaluation in the Phase 3 studies: the ongoing 
trial RSV MAT -009 (NCT 04605159)  which is a  Phase III doub le-blind study to assess 
safety and efficacy  of an RSV maternal unadjuvanted vaccine, in pregnant women and 
infants born to vaccinated mothers . Also ongoing is the RSV MAT -012 trial, that is 
designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity in the high-risk 
obstetric population.  
The objective of this  study is to evaluate the immunogenicity as well as safety and 
reactogenicity of RSV maternal vaccine in healthy non -pregnant girls 9 -17 YOA 
(pediatric study group*) and in non-pregnant adult women 18 -49 YOA (adult study ). 
* For purpose of this study we will classify all females between 9 -17 YOA as “girls” with 
the understanding that this age range includes children (9 -11 year of age) and 
adolescents: (12 to 18 [further dependent on the region]). [ICH E11, 2017] 
In this study, Boostrix will be used as an active vaccine. Two formulations of dTpa 
vaccine, each containing either 300 µg or 500 µg of Aluminum are licensed in the US 
and outside of the US (ex -US), respectively. Boostrix-US formulation (dTpa_300) will be 
administered to participant s in centers located in the US, while the Boostrix-ex-US 
formulation  (dTpa_500) will be administered to participant s in centers ex -US [Christy, 
1995]. Even though two different formulations for Boostrix are available , both have  a 
similar immunogenicity and safety profiles. [Theeten, 2005] 
Objectives and endpoints/estimands of the RSV MAT -039 study are presented in  Section 
3. 
• Following  review of data collected so far from the RSV MAT -009 study in 
pregnant women, safety signals have been identified. An imbalance in the 
proportion of preterm births and neonatal deaths have been observed in infants 
born to vaccinated mothers who received RSV maternal vaccine versus those who 
received a placebo. The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this 
time a cause has not been determined, based on the above observations, GSK has 
nevertheless decided to stop enrolment and vaccination for all actively enrolling 
RSV MAT studies.  
• There will be no new participants included in this study . However, safety  
monitoring of all 8 study participants (of the planned 252 study participants)

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  22 enrolled and vaccinated in RSV MAT -039 study in a study site in the US will 
continue during the rest of the study period.  
• The vaccination planned at visit 2 is removed. Therefo re, Contact 2 at Day 38 and 
Visit 3 at Day 61 are not applicable anymore. Visit 4a (Day 181) and Visit 4b (Day 
211) are replaced by a telephone contact at Day 181.  
•  A blood sample for immunogenicity assessment in the study participants who 
received first dose of RSV Maternal vaccine will  continue to  be collected at Visit 2 
only. No other blood samples will be collected.  
• All planned objectives will be analysed and reported in a descriptive manner for  
the 8 enrolled participants.  
2.2. Background  
Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for background information on 
RSV infection, the rationale for the maternal immunization approach described in this 
protocol, and information regarding pre -clinical and clinical studies of the RSV maternal 
vaccine and epidemiology studies of RSV infection . 
2.3. Benefit/Risk a ssessment  (Amended 17 March  2022) 
GSK has included provisions in this trial to ensure participant’s safety.  Safety monitoring 
has been and will be conducted throughout this study by an  unblinded Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC) and by  the Sponsor.  Measures to suspend the study 
should a potential safety issue be identified are described in Section  8.2.3. 
Following a recommendation from the IDMC, the Sponsor made the decision to pause 
the enrollment, randomization and vaccination of pregnant study participants in our 
active studies based on an  observation of imbalance of the proportion of preterm births 
between the vaccine group and the placebo group in the RSV MAT -009 study in 
pregnant women. This pause was to allow for an evaluation of the available data in 
RSV MAT -009 to better understand th e safety signal observed. Following a review of 
additional unblinded data from RSV MAT -009 trial in which a higher proportion of 
neonatal deaths reported in the treatment group compared to the placebo group was 
also observed, the Sponsor decided to STOP en rollment and vaccination in these 
studies.  
The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this time a cause has not 
been determined, as a precautionary measure GSK stopped active enrollment and 
further vaccination of participants in the RSV MA T studies enrolling both pregnant 
women on February 25, 2022 and non -pregnant women on March 1, 2022. The study 
remains ongoing for safety follow -up. Participants already vaccinated will continue to 
be monitored until the end of the study.

4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  
This study is part of a clinical development plan of the RSV maternal vaccine for the 
protection of infants from RSV lower respiratory tract infections through maternal 
immunization. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity  of 
the RSV maternal vaccine in non-pregnant girls from 9  to 17 YOA in order to s how that 
the humoral immunogenicity is non inferior to the immunogenicity , safety and 
reactogenicity  observed in non-pregnant adult women aged 18 to 49 YOA. 
Following the decision to stop all RSV maternal studies, this study will only explore 
immunogenicity and safety of RSV MAT vaccine in study participants  (who received 
fist dose at Visit 1)  9 to 17 years of age and 18 to 49 years of age  and non-inferiority 
between the groups will not be assessed.  
4.3. Justification for dose  
A single formulation of the investigational RSV maternal vaccine (containing 120 µg of 
the RSVPreF3 antigen) is proposed. Currently available data suggest that the 120 µg 
formulation has an acceptable safety profile and tends to elicit stronger immune 
responses in non -pregnant (RSV MAT -001 and RSV MAT -011) and pregnant (RSV 
MAT-004) women, which is likely to result in higher placental transfer of antibodies to 
the fetus than formulations containing 30 or 60 µg of the RSVPreF3 antigen. Available 
results from these studies are in cluded in the Investigator Brochure.  
It is assumed that nearly all human s are infected with RSV in their early life  and have 
pre-existing neutralizing antibody . Results of study RSV MAT -001 in non -pregnant 
women indicate that a single dose of the study vac cine is sufficient to boost the 
neutralizing antibodies induced by previous natural infections.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  33 Study participants must be observed closely for at least 30 minutes after the 
administration of the study intervention(s). Appropriate medical treatment must be 
readily available during the observation period in case of anaphylaxis, syncope .  
6.2. Preparation, handling, storage, and accountabilit y 
The study intervention(s) must be stored in a secured place  within the temperature range 
specified on the study intervention’s label. The storage temperature should be 
continuously monitored and recorded with a calibrated (if not validated) temperature 
monitoring device(s).  
Only authorized study personnel should be allowed access to the study intervention(s) . 
Storage conditions w ill be assessed by a sponsor study contact during pre -study activities. 
Refer to the Study Procedure s Manual (SPM) for more details on storage and handling of 
the study intervention(s)  
6.3. Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding 
(Amended 17 March  2022) 
6.3.1. Participant  identification  
Each participating country and site will have a range of participant identification number 
and enrolled subjects will be assigned to those numbers sequentially.  
6.3.2. Randomisation to study intervention  
A total of 252 participan ts will be enrolled evenly in 2 age groups, (9 -17 YOA and 18 -49 
YOA). Within each age group, approximately 126 participa nts will be 1:1 randomized 
either receiving RSV maternal vaccine followed by dTpa vaccine 30 days later or 
receiving dTpa vaccine follow ed by RSV maternal vaccine 30 days later.  Study is 
stopped after enrolling 8 subjects (7 adult and one adolescent) hence no more 
randomization and intervention will be applicable . 
6.3.3. Intervention allocation to the participant  
The randomization algorithm will use a stratification procedure accounting for 
participants age at the time of study intervention administration (9 -17 YOA, 18 -49 YOA) 
and a minimization procedure accounting for (a) Center and (b) Study. Minimization 
factors will have equal weight in the minimization algorithm . 
Once a participant identification number is allocated, the randomisation system will 
determine study group and  will provide the study intervention  number to be used for the 
first dose. The study inter vention number(s) to be used for subsequent dosing will be 
provided by the same automated Internet -based system  (SBIR) 
When an automated, Internet -based system (SBIR) is not available, please refer  to the 
SBIR user guide or SPM for specific instructions.  
Refer to the SPM for additional information about the study intervention number  
allocation.

6.3.5. Blinding and unblinding  
This is an open-label study; however, an electronic system will be used for alloc ation of 
treatment numbers. Potential bias will be reduced by the using the allocation system on 
the internet and adjudications  
The laboratory in charge of sample testing will be blinded to the study intervention 
assignment. Codes will be used to link the participant and study to each sample. There 
will be no link between the study intervention  groups and the identity of the participant.  
6.3.5.1. Emergency unblinding  
Not applicable since this is an unblinded study  
6.4. Study intervention compliance  
When the study intervention is administered at the site, participants will receive it directly 
from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date of administration 
of each study intervention dose in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents.  
The intervention number administered, and the administration date and time will be 
recorded in the source documents.

study intervention  until the end of the study .  
• All concomitant medication leading to discontinuation of the study intervention or 
elimination from the analysis, including products/vaccines . Please refer to the 
sections 5.2 and 9.2.1 for further details.  
• Any concomitant medications/products/vaccines listed in Section 5.2.2 during the 
period specified in that section.  
• All concomitant medication which may explain/cause/ be used to treat an SAE  
including vaccines/products, as defined in Sections 8.3.1 and 10.3.8. These must also 
be recorded in the Expedited Adverse Event report.  
• Prophylactic medication related to the effects (actual or anticipated) of study 
vaccine/product administration (e.g., medication administered either in the absence 
of ANY symptom and in anticipation of a reaction to the study vaccine, or to prevent 
re-occurrence of one or more post -vaccination AEs such as headache).  
The Local Medical Lead (LML) should be contacted if there are any q uestions regarding 
concomitant or prior therapy.  
7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION AN D 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of study intervention  
‘Discontinuation’ of study intervention refers to any participant who has not received all 
planned doses of study intervention. A participant who discontinued study intervention 
may continue other study procedures (e.g. safety or immunogenicity), planned in the 
study protocol at the discretion of the investigator.  
The primary reason for premature discontinuation of the study intervention  will be 
documented on the  eCRF as follows:  
• Adverse event requiring expedited reporting to GSK  
• Unsolicited non -serious adverse event  
• Solicited adverse event  
• Not willing to be vaccinated  
• Other (specify).  
7.1.1. Contraindications to subsequent study intervention(s) 
administration  
Contraindications of study interventions do not apply since this is a single  (experimental)  
dose study.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  36 7.2. Participant discontinuation /withdrawal f rom the study  
A participant is considered to have withdrawn from the study if no new study procedure 
has been performed or no new information has been collected for him/her since the date 
of withdrawal/last contact.  
From an analysis perspective, a study ‘w ithdrawal’ refers to any participant who did not 
return for the concluding visit planned in the protocol.  
Investigators will attempt to contact participants who do not return for scheduled visits or 
follow-up. 
All data and samples collected up to and incl uding the date of withdrawal of/last contact 
with the participant will be included in the study analyses.  
The primary reason for study withdrawal will be documented in the  eCRF, based on the 
list below:  
• Adverse events requiring expedited  reporting to GSK  
• Unsolicited non -serious adverse events  
• Solicited adverse event  
• Withdrawal by participant, not due to an adverse event*  
• Migrated/Moved from the study area  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor study termination  
• Other (specify)  
*If a participant is withdrawn from the study because  she/the participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s)  has withdrawn consent and the reason for withdrawal was provided, the 
investigator must document this reason in the  eCRF. 
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs/SAEs must be clearly  
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigator will 
follow participants who are withdrawn from the study due to an AE/SAE until the event 
is resolved (see Section 10.3.8.2). 
7.3. Lost to follow -up 
A participant will be considered ‘lost to follow -up’ if she fails to return for scheduled 
visits and cannot be contacted by the study site.  
Please refer to the SPM for a descript ion of actions to be taken before considering the 
participant lost to follow -up.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  37 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are only permitted when necessary for the management 
of immediate safety concerns for the participant.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor as soon as they occur or 
when the study team becomes aware of them. The purpose of this communication is to 
determine if the participant(s) should discontinue the study intervention.  
Study proc edures and their timing are summarised in the SoA (Section 1.3).  
All screening evaluations must be completed and the results reviewed before confirming 
that potenti al participants meet all eligibility criteria.  
The investigator will maintain a log of all participants screened. All relevant information, 
such as confirmation of eligibility and reasons for screening failure will be mentioned in 
this screening log.  
Procedures conducted as part of routine clinical management (e.g. hematologic profiles), 
and obtained before the participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) signed the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF), may be used for screening and/or for establishing a clinical bas eline 
(provided the procedure met protocol  specified criteria and was performed within the 
time frame defined in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
The SPM provides the investiga tor and site personnel with detailed administrative and 
technical information that does not impact participant safety.  
Study Procedures During Special Circumstances  
• During special circumstances (e.g., the COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance 
from loca l public health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be applied. Please refer to the SPM for details.  
For the duration of such special circumstances, the following measures may be 
implemented for enrolled participants:  
• Enrollment of additional participants may be placed on hold. Decisions on re -starting 
enrollment to  achieve the planned sample size will be made in a manner consistent 
with guidance from public health and other competent authorities.  
• The following measures may be implemented for enrolled participants:  
− If it is not possible to conduct a protocol -specified, scheduled or event -driven 
visit as described in Section  1.3 the visit may be replaced with a contact 
conducted by SMS, email, telephone, videotelephony or telemedicine. In such 
cases: 
− Protocol-specified clinical data that  
− cannot be collected by study staff during the contact (e.g., physical 
examinatio n results) BUT

medical records and can be obtained by site staff (as allowed by local 
law), may  be recorded in the participant’s source document and entered 
into the eCRF.  
− Whenever possible, as appropriate per the judgment of the investigator and as 
allowed by local law, arrangements should be made for qualified personnel to 
collect any protocol -specified safety data, safety assessment(s), and/or  biological 
samples at an alternate location* within the visit interval (Table 2). 
− Samples should not be collected if they cannot be processed in a timely 
manner and / or appropriately stored until the intended use.  
− Blood samples for central assessment must be collected using GSK -
provided supplies.  
− “Medically attended visits” will include instances where, due to the speci al 
circumstances, the participant cannot seek medical advice for symptoms/an 
illness by visiting a medical facility or arranging for a home visit, and seeks this 
advice instead via telephone, SMS, email, videotelephony or telemedicine, or 
other means.  
Additional details of how these visits can be conducted are outlined in the SPM.  
Impact on the analysis sets for immunogenicity will be determined on a case by case 
basis. 
*It is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an alternate location. The investig ator 
should ensure that this alternate location meets ICH GCP requirements, such as adequate 
facilities to perform study procedures, appropriate training of the staff and documented 
delegation of responsibilities in this location. This alternate location s hould be covered by 
proper insurance for the conduct of study on participants by investigator and staff at a site 
other than the designated study site.  
8.1. Immunogenicity assessments  
Biological samples will be used for research planned in the protocol and for purposes 
related to the improvement, development and quality assurance of the laboratory tests 
described in this protocol.  
Findings in this or future studies may make it desirable to use samples acquired in this 
study for research not planned in this protocol. In this case, all participants in countries 
where this is allowed will be asked to give consent to allow GSK or a cont racted partner, 
to use the samples for further research. The further research will be participant  to prior 
IEC/IRB approval, if required by local legislation.  
Information on further research and its rationale can be obtained from GSK.  
Sample testing will b e done in accordance with the recorded consent of the individual 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s).

period begins when the last participant performs the last stu dy visit. This timeline can be 
adapted based on local laws, regulations or guidelines requiring different timeframes or 
procedures. In all cases, the storage period should be aligned with participant’s consent. 
These additional requirements must be formall y communicated to, discussed and agreed 
with GSK.

An internal SRT and external IDMC  (external to GSK) will review the safety data on a 
regular basis throughout the study. Any potential safety concern identified will be 
escalated to the GSK Vaccine Safety Monitoring Board (VSMB).  
8.2.3.1. Safety evaluation by the Safety Review Team  
The SRT includes as core members the GSK’ Central Safety physician, Safety scientist, 
Clinical Research & Development Lead (CRDL), Epidemiologist, Global Regulatory 
Lead and Biostatistician of the project. The SRT is r esponsible for ongoing safety 
monitoring of the entire study , reviewing the unblinded safety data on a regular, ongoing 
basis. The SRT will inform the IDMC about any potential safety concern at any point 
during the study and may request ad -hoc safety evalu ations by the IDMC.  
8.2.3.2. Independent Data Monitoring Committee Evaluation  
An unblinded IDMC will be established by GSK. The IDMC will monitor the safety data 
and the scientific validity of the study. The IDMC and SRT will review safety data (as 
clean as possib le) on an ongoing basis. Additional details concerning the IDMC’s 
structure and processes will be provided in the IDMC charter.  
8.2.3.3. Study holding rules  
The safety holding rules are defined in  Table 9. Holding rules 1a -b will be assessed by 
the investigator on a continuous basis.  
Table 9 Study holding rules 
Holding 
Rule  Event  Number of 
participants  
1a Any death within 30 days from study dose administration of the interventio ns (RSV 
maternal vaccine  and dTpa ) that  cannot be reasonably attributed to a cause other 
than vaccination as per Investigator assessment  ≥ 1 
1b Any life -threatening SAE within 30 days from study dose administration of the 
interventio ns (RSV maternal vaccine  and dTpa ) that cannot be reasonably attributed 
to a cause other than vaccination as per Investigator assessment  ≥ 1 
The following communicati on sequence must be followed:  
If at any time, there is a safety concern identified by the SRT or if a holding rule is met, a 
hold on study dose administration can be implemented pending further investigation.  
Table 9 presents the safety holding rules 1 (a -b) to be assessed by the investigator on an 
ongoing basis. Meeting a holding rule will trigger a hold of study intervention 
administration irrespective o f number of participants enrolled and/or timing of the event 
relative to study dose administration.  While vaccinations are on hold, the investigator 
should not consent subjects into the study.

217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  43 If the investigator becomes aware of a holding rule being met, he/she must suspend 
administration of the study intervention and inform GSK immediately and enter the data 
in the electronic case report form (eCRF). (e.g. holding rules 1a -b). Refer to Table 12 for 
contact information. It is Sponsor’s responsibility to put the enrolment or the study 
intervention administration on hold at all centers.  The IDMC will be informed once a 
holding rule is met . 
GSK will inform all investigator s if holding rules 1a-b are met. 
Additional safety data, if required, will also be reviewed by the IDMC to allow for an 
overall assessment of the benefit/risk profile of vaccination. The IDMC may recommend 
that the study be placed on hold for reasons not covered by the holding rules if de emed 
necessary.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  44 The investigator or designee will record and immediately report all SAEs in enrolled 
participants to the sponsor or designee via the Expedited AE Reporting Form. Reporting 
should, under no circumstances, occur later than 24 hours after the investigator becomes 
aware of an SAE, as indicated in Section 10.3.10. The investigator will submit any 
updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.   
A post-study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting p eriods defined in Table 10. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs 
or SAEs from former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, 
including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and 
he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the 
investigator will promptly notify the study contact for reporti ng SAEs mentioned in the 
Table 12. 
8.3.2. Method of detecting AEs and SAEs, pregnancies and other 
events 
Detection and recording of AE/SAE /pregnancies are detailed in Section 10.3.8.  
Assessment of AE/SAE intensity, causality and outcome are described  in Section 10.3.9.  
Open-ended and non -leading verbal questioning of participants/participants’ 
parent(s)/LAR(s) is the preferred method of acquiring information related to an 
AE/SAE/pregnancy. 
8.3.3. Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs, pregnancies and 
other events  
Once an investigator (or designee) becomes aware that a study participant has 
experienced an SAE /pregnancy, it must be reported to GSK using the required 
documentation and within the timeframes mentioned in Table 11. This is essential for 
meeting GSK legal obligations and ethical responsibilities f or participant safety and the 
safety of a study intervention  under clinical investigation.  
For SAEs the investigator must always provide an assessment of causality at the time of 
the initial report, as de fined in the Section 10.3.9.2. 
Local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy for preparation of an investigator 
safety report of Suspected Unexpect ed Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) must be 
followed. These reports will be forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
The sponsor has the legal responsibility to notify local authorities/regulatory agencies 
about the safety of an investigational study inte rvention. The sponsor will comply with 
country-specific regulatory requirements related to safety reporting to the regulatory 
authority, IRB/IEC and investigators.  
Please refer to Section 10.3.10 for further details regarding the reporting of 
SAEs/pregnancies.

17 March 2022  52 10.1.3. Informed consent process  
The investigator or his/her representative must fully explain the nature of the study to the 
participant/participant’s parent(s) or his/her LAR(s) and answer all questions regarding 
the study.  
Participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s)  must be informed that their participation is 
voluntary.  
Freely given and written/witnessed/thumb printed  informed consent must be obtained 
from each participant and/or each participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)/ witness and participant 
informed assent, as appropriate, prior to participation in the study.  
The content of the informed consent form must meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50, 
local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  
(HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study centre.  
The medical record must include a statement that written or  witnessed/thumb printed 
informed consent was obtained before the participant was enrolled in the study and the 
date the co nsent was obtained. The authorised person obtaining the informed consent 
must also sign the ICF.  
Participants must be re -consented if a new version of the ICF(s) or an ICF addendum is 
released during their participation in the study.  
A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s).  
Re-consent must be obtained in accordance with local laws and regulations for 
participants who become legally emancipated during the study, i.e. reach the legal age of 
consent. The parti cipant can provide consent by signing/witnessing/thumb printing an 
ICF, similar to that provided to the parent(s)/LAR(s) at study start, which summarises the 
study and includes a consent statement and documents that the participant agrees to 
continue parti cipating in the study.  
The study investigator is encouraged to obtain assent from the minor in addition to the 
consent provided by the LAR(s) when a minor can assent to decisions about his/her 
participation in a study. The investigator is also accountable for determining a minor's 
capacity to assent to participation in a research study according to the local laws and 
regulations.  
10.1.4. Data protection  
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any participant records 
or datasets transferred  to the sponsor will contain only the identifier. Name and any other 
information which would identify the participant will not be transferred.

Safety overs ight will be provided by a n SRT composed of GSK RSV team members  and 
also by an IDMC.  
10.1.6. Dissemination of clinical study data  
The key design elements of this protocol and results summaries will be posted on 
www.ClinicalTrials.gov and/or GSK Clinical Study Register in compliance with 
applicable regulations/GSK policy. GSK will aim to register protocols summaries prior to 
study start and target results summaries submission within 12 months of primary/ study 
completion date. Where external regulations require earlier disclosure, GSK will follow 
those timelines.  
Where required by regulation, summaries will also be posted on applicabl e national or 
regional clinical study registers. 
Where required by applicable regulatory requirements, an investigator signatory will be 
identified for the approval of the study report, and provided reasonable access to 
statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports. GSK will also provide the investigator 
with the full summary of the study results. The investigator is encouraged to share the 
summary results with the study participants, as appropriate.  
GSK will provide the investigator with the randomization codes for their site only after 
completion of the full statistical analysis.  
GSK intends to make anonymized  patient-level data from this study available to external 
researchers for scientific analyses or to conduct further research that can help adv ance 
medical science or improve patient care. This helps ensure the data provided by study 
participants are used to maximum effect in the creation of knowledge and understanding.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  54 10.1.7. Data quality assurance  
The investigator should maintain a record of the locat ion(s) of their respective essential 
documents, including source documents. The document storage system used during the 
study and for archiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for 
document identification, version history, search, an d retrieval.  
Essential study documents may be added or removed where justified (in advance of study 
initiation) based on their importance and relevance to the study. When a copy is used to 
replace an original document (e.g. source documents, CRF), the cop y should fulfil the 
requirements for certified copies . 
All participant data related to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF 
unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (e.g. laboratory data). The 
investigator is responsi ble for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
physically or electronically signing the eCRF.  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source documents and study 
records that include all pertinent observations on each of the si te’s study participants  that 
supports information entered in the  eCRF.  
The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source documents or certified 
copies for s uch review and inspection.  
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the source data . 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
in the eCRF by authorized  site personnel are attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data must be traceable, not obscure 
the original entry, and be fully explained if necessary (e.g. via an audit trail). The safety 
and rights of participants must be protected, and the study conducted in accordance with 
the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
Quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be pre -defined in the Study Management Plan to 
identify systematic issues that can impact participant safety and/or the reliability of study 
results. These pre -defined parameters will be monitored during the study. Important 
deviations from the QTLs and remedial actions taken will be summarized  in the Clinical 
Study Report (CSR). 
Study records and source documents pertaining to the conduct of this study, including 
signed ICFs, must be retained by the investigator for 25 years from issuance of the final 
CSR/equivalent summary  unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer 
retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the 
written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or 
party without written notification to the  sponsor.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  55 10.1.8. Source documents  
Source documents provide evidence to establish the existence of the participant and 
substantiate the integrity of collected data. The investigator should maintain a record of 
the location(s) of their source documents.  
Data transcribed into the  eCRF from source documents must be consistent with those 
source documents; any discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to 
request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, 
current medica l records must be available.  
Definitions of what constitutes source data and documents can be found in the Glossary 
of terms. 
10.1.9. Study and site start  and closure  
First act of recruitment  
The study start date is the date on which the first subject is enrolled/ randomized and is 
considered the first act of enrollment.  
Study/Site termination   
GSK or its designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at its sole discretion, provided there is sufficient notice given to 
account for all participants safe exit from study.  
Regular closure of stu dy sites will occur upon study completion. A study site is 
considered closed when all required data/documents and study supplies have been 
collected and a study site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and enough notice in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include 
but are not limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with t he protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development  
• Total number of parti cipants included earlier than expected  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform 
the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research 
organisation(s) used in the study of the r eason for termination or suspension, as specified 
by the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the 
participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow -up.

10.1.10. Publication policy  
GSK aims to submit the results of the study for publication in searchable, peer reviewed 
scientific literature within 18 months from the Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV) for 
interventional studies and follows the guidance from the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).  
10.2. Appendix 2: Clinical laboratory tests  
10.2.1. Descriptions of the assays to be performed in the study 
Assay descriptions could be subject to change, due to assay re -development and/or 
qualification.  
RSV-A and RSV -B neutralization assays  
The RSV-A and RSV -B neutralization assays are functional assays that measure the 
ability of serum antibodies to ne utralize RSV entry and replication in a host cell line.  
Virus neutralization is performed by incubating a fixed amount of RSV  with serial 
dilutions of the test serum. Then, the serum -virus mixture is transferred onto a Vero cells 
culture and incubated for two days to allow infection of Vero cells . Thereafter, RSV-
infected cells are detected by the visualization of the number of plaques.  
RSVPreF3 IgG ELISA  
The ELISA assay is based on an indirect ELISA allowing the detection and the 
quantification of specific IgG antibodies directed against RSVPreF3 in human serum 
samples and related to reference standard . The optical density of each sample dilution is 
then interpolated on the reference standard. The corresponding antibody concentration, 
corrected for the dilution factor, is expressed in arbitrary ELISA Laboratory Units per 
milliliter (ELU/mL).

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  57 10.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: definitions and procedures for 
recording, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting  
10.3.1. Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any unt oward medical occurrence (an unfavourable/unintended sign - including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) in a clinical 
study participant that is temporally associated with the study intervention. The AE may or 
may not be considered related to the study intervention.  
10.3.1.1.  Events Meeting the AE Definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including eit her an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after administration of the study 
intervention even though they may have been present before study start.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug, disease or other 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either the 
study intervention or a concurrent medication.  
• Signs or symptoms temporally associated with administration of the study 
interventi on. 
• Signs, symptoms that require medical attention (e.g. hospital stays, physician visits 
and emergency room visits)  
• Significant failure of an expected pharmacologic or biological action.  
• Pre- or post- intervention events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of participant’s previous 
therapeutic regimen).  
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments 
that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following t he start of the study 
will also be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
• AEs to be recorded as solicited AEs are described in the Section 10.3.3. All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will 
be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  58 10.3.1.2.  Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the st udy that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a participant before 
the study intervention. These events will be recorded in the medical history section 
of the eCRF.  
• Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed before signing the informed consent) that did not worsen from baseline.  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments associated with the underlying disease, unless judged b y the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
10.3.2. Definition of an SAE 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life-threatening  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more 
severe. 
c. Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing  hospitalisation  
Note: In general, hospitali sation signifies that the participant has been admitted 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalisation are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitali sation or fulfils any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitali sation” occ urred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious . 
d. Results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental 
trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions 
but do not constitute a  substantial disruption . 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  59 f. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, f oetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  
g. Other situations  
Medical or scientific judgement must be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations. Important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may 
jeopardise the participant or requi re medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition should be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers; intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias; and 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation . 
10.3.3. Solicited events  
a. Solicited administration  site events  
The following administration site events will be solicited:  
Table 14 Solicited administration site  events 
All age groups  
Pain  
Redness   
Swelling  
b. Solicited systemic events 
The following systemic events  will be solicited:  
Table 15 Solicited systemic events 
Fever  
Headache  
GI Symptoms (Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Abdominal 
pain) *  
Fatigue  
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain are collected individually.  
Note: participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to measure and record 
the axillary or oral temperature  in the evening. If additional temperature measurements 
are taken at other times of the day, participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s)  will be 
instructed to record the highest temperature in the e-diary. 
10.3.4. Unsolicited  adverse events  
An unsolicited adverse event is an adverse  event that was not included in a list of 
solicited events using a Participant Diary. Unsolicited events must have been 
spontaneously communicated by a participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) who has 
signed the informed consent. Unsolicited AEs include both serious and non -serious AEs.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  60 Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e. symptoms or illnesses requiring 
a hospitalisation, or an emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider). The 
participants/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the site as soon as 
possible to report medically attended event(s), as well as any events that, though not 
medically attended, are of participant/parental/LAR’s concern. Detailed information 
about reported uns olicited AEs will be collected by qualified site personnel and 
documented in the participant’s records.  
Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended or perceived as a concern by the 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be collected during an interview with the 
participants/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  and by review of available medical records at 
the next visit.  
10.3.5. Adverse events of special interest  (AESIs) 
Not applicable  
10.3.6. Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying  as AEs or SAEs   
If the investigator considers it necessary to conduct laboratory tests  to rule out any 
SAE/Medically attended SAE during the participation in the study, those results should 
be shared with the central team.  
In the absence of a diagnosis, a bnormal laboratory findings assessments or other 
abnormal results the investigator considers clinically significant will be recorded as an 
AE or SAE, if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Sections 10.3.1 and 
10.3.2).  
The investigator must exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding, or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  
10.3.7. Events or outcomes not qualifying as AEs or SAEs  
10.3.7.1.  Pregnancy  
Female participants who become pregnant after administration of the study intervention 
may continue the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SA E, any abnormal pregnancy 
outcome or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will 
be recorded and reported as an SAE. Please refer to Section 10.3.2 for definition of SAE.

217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  61 10.3.8. Recording and follow -up of AEs, SAEs , and pregnancies  
The participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the 
investigator immediately should they  experience any signs or symptoms they perceive as 
serious.  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the investigator’s responsibility to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event. The investigator  will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE 
on the eCRF. The investigator may not send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to GSK instead of appropriately completing the eCRF.  
There may be instances when copies of medical r ecords for certain cases are requested by 
GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers will be blinded on copies of the medical 
records prior to submission to GSK.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event, based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE instead of individual signs/symptoms.  
An electronic Diary ( eDiary) will  be used in this study to capture solicited administration 
site or sys temic events. The participant should be trained on how and when to complete 
the eDiary. 
Anyone who measures administration site or systemic events and who will record the 
event in the eDiary should  be trained on using the eDiary. This training must be 
documented in the participant’s source record.  
Note: eDiary may be completed by a minor participant under the supervision of the 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  provided the minor is capable of assessing and reporting 
the information to be recorded on eDiary. The ultimate accountability for completion of 
the eDiary remains with the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s). The investigator should 
discuss this accountability with the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s). Please see SPM for 
more detail  
Collect and verify completed eDiary during discussions with the participant/participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) on Visit 2 (Day 31) and Visit 3 (Day 61) . 
Any unreturned  eDiary device will be sought from the participant/participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s)  through tel ephone call(s) or any other convenient procedure.   
Refer to the SPM for more information regarding the use of eDiary.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  62 10.3.8.1.  Time period for collecting and recording AEs, SAEs, and pregnancies  
All solicited events that occur for 7 days following administration of each dose  (RSV 
maternal vaccine  or dTpa) of study intervention  (Day 1 to Day 7) and (Day 31 to Day 38) 
must be recorded into  the eDiary, irrespective of intensity. All other AEs occurring 
within this time frame should be r ecorded into  the appropriate section of the eCRF , 
irrespective of their intensity or whether or not they are considered related to the study 
intervention.  
10.3.8.2.  Follow-up of AEs, SAEs, pregnancies or any other events of interest  
After the initial AE/SAE /pregnancy  or any other event of interest, the investigator is 
required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs  
will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilised, otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow-up. 
Other non -serious AEs  must be followed until the end of the study  or until the participant 
is lost to follow -up. 
10.3.8.2.1.  Follow-up during the study  
If a participant dies during their participation in the study or during a recognised follow -
up period,  GSK will be provided with any available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
10.3.8.2.2.  Follow-up after the participant is discharged from the study  
The investigator will provide any new or updated relevant information to GSK on a 
previously reported SAE  using a paper/electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report 
and/or pregnancy report as applicable. The investigator is obliged to perform or arrange 
for the conduct of supplemental clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the SAE as fully as possible.  
10.3.8.2.3.  Follow-up of pregnancies  
Pregnant participants will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. At the 
end of the pregnancy, whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the 
mother and c hild will be forwarded to GSK using the electronic pregnancy report and the 
Expedited Adverse Events Report if applicable. Generally, the follow -up period does not 
need to be longer than 6 to 8 weeks after the estimated date of delivery.  
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs in this study, if the pregnancy outcome is an 
SAE, it should always be reported as such.  
Furthermore, if the investigator becomes aware of any SAE occurring as a result of a 
post-study pregnancy AND it is considered by the investi gator to be reasonably related to 
the study intervention, he/she must report this information to GSK as described in the 
Section 10.3.10.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  63 10.3.8.3.  Updating of SA E and pregnancy information after removal of write 
access to the participant’s eCRF  
When additional SAE  or pregnancy information is received after write access to the 
participant’s eCRF is removed, new or updated information should be recorded on the 
appropriate paper report, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. The 
updated report should be faxed to the Study contact for reporting SAEs (refer to Section 
8.3.3.1 or to GSK VCSP department within the defined reporting timeframes specified in 
the Table 11). 
10.3.9. Assessment of intensity and toxicity  
10.3.9.1.  Assessment of intensity  
The intensity of the following solicited AEs will be assessed as described:  
Table 16 Intensity scales for solicited events in adults and children of 6 years 
of age or more  
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.

CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  64 The intensity should be assigned to 1 of the following categories:  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3  should not be confused with an SAE. Grade 3 
is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets 1 of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in the Section 10.3.2. 
10.3.9.2.  Assessment of causality  
The investigator must assess the relationship between study intervention  and the 
occurrence of each unsolicited AE/SAE using clinical judgement. Where several different 
interventions were administered, the investigator should specify, when possible, if the 
unsolicited AE/SAE could be causally related to a specific intervention.  When a causal 
relationship to a specific study intervention cannot be determined, the investigator should 
indicate the unsolicited AE/SAE to be related to all interventions.  
Alternative possible causes, such as the natural history of underlying disease, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study intervention  will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult 
the IB and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products  to assist in 
making his/her assessment.  
Causality should be assessed by the investigator using the following question:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the unsolicited AE may have been caused by the 
study intervention?  
YES : There is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention  contributed 
to the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study intervention. There are other, more likely 
causes and administration of the study intervention is not suspected to 
have contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined ‘serious’ (see Section 10.3.2), addition al 
examinations/tests will be performed by the investigator to determine ALL possible 
contributing factors for each SAE.

17 March 2022  65 Possible contributing factors include:  
• Medical history.  
• Other medication.  
• Protocol required procedure.  
• Other procedure not required by the protocol.  
• Lack of efficacy of the study intervention, if applicable.  
• An error in study intervention administration.  
• Other cause (specify).  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important to 
record an assessment of causality for every event before submitting the Expedited 
Adverse Events Report to GSK.  
The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality after receiving 
additional information and update the SAE information accordingly.  
10.3.9.3.  Medically attended visits  
For each solicited and unsolicited AE  the participant experiences, the 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked if she  received medical attention 
(defined as hospitalisation, or an otherwise unschedule d visit to or from medical 
personnel for any reason, including emergency room visits). Only serious medical 
attended visits will be recorded in the eCRF/ Expedited Adverse Events Report , and/if 
solicited in the eDiary.  
10.3.9.4.  Assessment of outcomes  
The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) 
recorded during the study as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Not recovered/not resolved  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae  
• Fatal (SAEs only).

17 March 2022  66 10.3.10. Reporting of SAE s, pregnancies and other events  
10.3.10.1.  Events requiring expedited reporting to GSK  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred  in enrolled participant , the 
investigator (or designee) must complete information in the electronic Expedited Adverse 
Events Report WITHIN 24 HOURS, even if the investigator does not have complete 
information on the SAE. It must be completed as thoroughly as possible, with all 
available details of the event.  
The SAE report must be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS of the receipt of u pdated 
information on the SAE. The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality 
at the time of the initial report.  
Refer to the Table 11 for the details on timeframes for reporting of SAEs /pregnancies.  
The investigator will be required to confirm the review of SAE causality by ticking the 
‘reviewed’ box in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 72 hours of 
submission of the  SAE. 
Refer to Section 10.3.10.2  for information on back up systems in case the electronic 
reporting system does not work.  
10.3.10.2.  Back up  system in case the electronic reporting system does not work  
If the electronic reporting system does not work, the investigator (or designee) must fax 
or email a completed, dated and signed paper Expedited Adverse Events Report to the 
study contact for reporting SAEs (refer to Sponsor Information ) or to GSK VCSP 
department within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE.  
Investigator (or designee) must complete the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report 
within 24 hours after the electronic reporting system is working again. The information 
reported through the electronic SAE reporting system will be considered valid for 
regulatory repo rting purposes.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  67 10.4.1.1.1.  Women not considered as women of childbearing potential  
• Premenarchal  
Menarche is the first onset of menses in a young female. Menarche is normally 
preceded by several changes associated with puberty including breast development 
and pubic hair gro wth.  
Additional evaluation should be considered if a participant’s fertility status is unclear 
(e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention.  
• Premenopausal female with ONE o f the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview . 
• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use a 
non-hormonal, highly effective contraception method if they wish to continue their 
HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation 
of postmenopausal status before study enrolment . 
10.4.2. Contraception g uidance  
• Female participants of childb earing potential are eligible to participate if they agree 
to use a highly effective contraceptive method consistently and correctly according 
to the methods listed in GSK’s list of highly effective contraceptive methods ( Table 
17).

Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomised partner  
(A vasectomised partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been conf irmed. If not, an additional highly 
effective method of contraception should be used.)  
Male partner sterilisation prior to the female participant’s entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that  
participant,  
(The information on the male  sterility can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records; medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview provided by her or her 
partner).  
Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence 
needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the  preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
participant.)

10.6.1. Definition of medical device AE and adverse device effect (ADE)  
• Medical device AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in a clinical study 
participant, users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention  whether considered related to a medical device or not. An AE can 
therefore be any unfav orable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of a medical device. This definition includes events related to the medical device 
or comparator and events r elated to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. This 
definition includes any AE resulting from:  
− insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user error), or  
− any malfunction of a medical device, or  
− intentional misuse of the medical device.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  70 10.6.2. Definition of medical device SAE, SADE and USADE  
A medical device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
a. Led to death   
b. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either  resulted in:  
− A life-threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the definition 
of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at 
the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically mi ght 
have caused death, if it were more severe.  
− A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
− Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization. Planned hospitalization for a pre -
existing condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, without ser ious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
− Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.  
c. Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnor mality or birth defect  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had not 
been taken or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE (USADE) definition  
• An USADE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by its nature, inciden ce, severity or outcome has 
not been identified in the current version of the IB.  
10.6.3. Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs, SADEs and 
USADE 
• Any device deficiency must be reported to GSK within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• Refer to paper ‘Medical device or combination product with device 
deficiency/incident report form’ for details on transmission of this information to the 
sponsor. 
• GSK will review all device deficiencies, d etermine and document in writing whether 
they could have led to an SAE. These device deficiencies will be reported to the 
regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs as required by national regulations.  
• If required or in case of any issues refer to the general sa fety contacts for SAE/AE 
reporting in Section 8.3.3.1

Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation participant, temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or  not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new 
or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, 
this also includes failure to produce expected benefits 
(i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Blinding:  A procedure in which 1 or more parties to the study are 
kept unaware of the intervention assign ment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the 
study, and only when the data are cleaned to an 
acceptable level of quality will appropriate personnel be 
unblinded or when require d in case of a serious adverse 
event  
In an open -label study, no blind is used. Both the 
investigator and the participant know the identity of the 
intervention assigned.  
Caregiver : A ‘caregiver’ is someone who  
− lives in the close surroundings of a participant 
and has a continuous caring role or  
− has substantial periods of contact with a 
participant and is engaged in his/her daily 
health care (e.g. a relative of the participant, a 
nurse who helps with daily activities in case of 
residence in a nursing  home).  
In the context of a clinical study, a caregiver could 
include an individual appointed to oversee and support 
the participant's compliance with protocol specified 
procedures.  
Certified copy:  A copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the 
original record that has been verified (i.e. by a dated 
signature or by generation through a validated process)

Section 1.2  Schema 
Based on all safety information  available from RSV MAT -009 study (following  
administration of RSV MAT vaccine), there will be no further enrollment and 
vaccination of participants in this study.  
There will be no more blood samples collected as part of this study , except the  study 
participant s who has received RSV  maternal vaccine at Visit 1 . A blood sample  will be 
collected and a urine pregnancy test will continue to be performed for them at Visit 2.  
Participants who are enrolled and are due to receive dTpa during their Visit 2 will no 
longer receive the dTpa as part of this study . However, as per the local standard of care 
and or immunization recommendation and after consultation with their attending 
physician ; the participant ca n always receive any commercially available dTpa vaccine . 
GSK will bear the cost of th e vaccine.  
All participants who receive the first dose of  study interventions ( RSV maternal vaccine  
or dTpa) will be followed for safety and reactogenicity and evaluated for  both solicited 
administration site (local) and systemic events within 7 days of va ccination, unsolicited 
AEs within 30 days of vaccination,  SAEs and pregnancy outcomes throughout the study 
period (180 days after first dose of  study interventions ). 
All safety data will be reviewed by  a Safety Review Team (SRT) and  an independent 
data monitoring committee  (IDMC). (See Section 8.2.3 for more details)

Section 2.1 Study Rationale  
• Following  review of data  collected so far from the RSV MAT -009 study in 
pregnant women, safety signals have been identified. An imbalance in the 
proportion of preterm births and neonatal deaths have been observed in infants 
born to vaccinated mothers who received RSV maternal vac cine versus those who 
received a placebo. The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this 
time a cause has not been determined, based on the above observations, GSK has 
nevertheless decided to stop enrolment and vaccination for all actively  enrolling 
RSV MAT studies.  
• There will be no new participants included in this study . However, safety 
monitoring of all 8 study participants (of the planned 252 study participants) 
enrolled and vaccinated in RSV MAT -039 study in a study site in the US will  
continue during the rest of the study period.  
• The vaccination planned at visit 2 is removed. Therefore, Contact 2 at Day 38 and 
Visit 3 at Day 61 are not applicable anymore. Visit 4a (Day 181) and Visit 4b (Day 
211) are replaced by a telephone contact at Day 181.  
•  A blood s ample for immunogenicity assessment in the study participants who 
received first dose of RSV Maternal vaccine will  continue to  be collected at Visit 2 
only. No other blood samples will be collected.  
• All planned objectives will be analysed and reported in a descriptive manner for  
the 8 enrolled participants.  
Section 2.3  Benefit/Risk assessment  
Following a recommendation from the IDMC, the Sponsor made the decision to pause 
the enrollment, randomization and vaccination of pregnant st udy participants in our 
active studies based on an observation of imbalance of the proportion of preterm births 
between the vaccine group and the placebo group in the RSV MAT -009 study in 
pregnant women. This pause was to allow for an evaluation of the ava ilable data in 
RSV MAT -009 to better understand the safety signal observed. Following a review of 
additional unblinded data from RSV MAT -009 trial in which a higher proportion of 
neonatal deaths reported in the treatment group compared to the placebo group  was 
also observed, the Sponsor decided to STOP enrollment and vaccination in these 
studies.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  80 The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this time a cause has not 
been determined, as a precautionary measure GSK stopped active enrollment and  
further vaccination of participants in the RSV MAT studies enrolling both pregnant 
women on February 25, 2022 and non -pregnant women on March 1, 2022. The study 
remains ongoing for safety follow -up. Participants already vaccinated will continue to 
be monitored until the end of the study.

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
BOTOX was first approved for aesthetic treatment of glabellar lines in 2001, lateral canthal lines (crow's 
feet lines) in 2013, and forehead lines in 2017.  BOTOX is one of the most common nonsurgical 
procedures in aesthetic medicine1.
 the medical literature has described the use of BOTOX to improve the 
appearance of th e lower face and neck .  Numerous publications specifically report the use of BOTOX to 
improve the appearance of the lower face by minimizing the effects of platysma muscle contra ction. 
The platysma muscle complex is composed of 2 separate, superficial muscle sheets that originate from 
the fascia of the upper thoracic region and pass upward over both sides of the neck, crossing over the 
mandibular border and inserting into the ove rlying skin of the neck and lower face.  When relaxed, the 
platysma muscle smoothly drapes the jawline, neck, and clavicle to create a firm, fitted, and uniform 
appearance ( Figure 1).

Sheets

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie. 
Allergan sponsored a Phase 2 study (1936 -201-008) designed to evaluate BOTOX for the treatment of 
platysma prominence.  This was a 4 -month, multicenter, ran domized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
dose -ranging study, comparing the efficacy and safety between a single treatment of BOTOX high dose 
 or BOTOX low dose  versus placebo in 171 subjects with moderate to severe 
platysma promi nence.
Subjects were adults ≥18 years old and moderate to severe 
platysma prominence, as rated at maximum contraction by both the investigator and subject using 
Allergan's platysma prominence scales.  Subjects were excluded from the study if 
had increased medical risk with exposure to BOTOX.  Subjects received a single treatment at baseline 
(Day 1) and were followed for approximately 120 days.
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, ≥ 1-grad e improvement from baseline in platysma 
prominence severity at Day 14, assessed independently by Clinician Allergan Platysma Prominence Scale
(C-APPS )and Participant Allergan Platysma Prominence Scale (P-APPS ), respectively, were achieved.  
Both high and low dose BOTOX results were statistically significant compared with placebo (p <0.0001).  
Similar results were observed with other study endpoints, which included patient reported outcome 
(PRO) measures , corroborati ng the C -APPS and P -APPS data.  
The safety profile observed was consistent with that reported in the medical literature and with the 
known pharmacological effects of BOTOX.  The most frequently reported AEs related to the study 
procedure were balanced acro ss all treatment groups and included injection site hemorrhage (6/169, 
3.6%) and injection site bruising (11/169, 6.5%).   
 
 
 
While AbbVie does not consider coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) to be a safety concern for BOTOX 
due to its mechanism of action and route of administration, the sponsor is monitoring COVID -19 events 
durin g the pandemic closely. A recent review of COVID -19 events for the periodic safety update report 
(PSUR)  did not identify any new or significant 
safety findings for the subjects receiving BOTOX treatment. Overall, the clinical course and presentation 
of patients with COVID -19 infection coincident with BOTOX is consistent with what has been described 
for the general population.
Considering the COVID -19 pandemic, based on the limited information to date, no additional risk to 
study participants is anticipated with the use of BOTOX.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current 
BOTOX Investigator's Brochure.

3.1 Objectives, Hypotheses , and Estimands
The study objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of BOTOX with placebo for the treatment of 
platysma prominence in adult subjects with moderate to severe platysma prominence at maximum 
contraction.
The clinical hypothesis is that B OTOX is a safe and effective treatment for the temporary improvement 
in the appearance associated with moderate tosevere platysma prominence in adults.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a 4 -month, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study designed to 
assess the safety and efficacy of BOTOX treatment in adult subjects with moderate to severe platysma 
prominence. 
To be eligible for enrollment, subjects must be at least 18 years of age,  
, and with either moderate (Grade 3) or severe 
(Grade 4) platysma prominence  
 
.  Eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive BOTOX or 
placebo.  
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized at up to 35 sites in the United States and Canada. 
. 
 
  
Seven scheduled visits are planned: screening (Day -14 to Day -7), randomization/study drug (Day 1), 
follow -up visits (Days 14, 30, 60, 90), and study exit (Day 120).  On Day 1, the study drug will be

5.3 Prohibited Medications and Therapy
The decision to administer a nyprohibited medication/treatment during the study period is done with 
the safety of the subject as the primary consideration.  Additionally, the medication/treatment listed 
below are prohibitive due to the potential c onfounding impact to efficacy assessment and not due to 
any potential safety risk to the subject.  When possible, the sponsor is to be notified before the 
prohibited medication/treatment is administered.
Prohibited treatments and procedures include, but ar e not limited to:
 
 
 
 
 
Site staff must notify the sponsor if a subject is administered or has taken any concomitant 
medications /procedures not permitted by the protocol.  
5.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine  
 that the subject is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the study 
must be recorded from 30 days prior to study drug administration through study exit.  See below fo r 
details on special handling for the COVID -19 vaccine.
The use of any medication during the study  
 is to be recorded on the subject's electronic case report form 
(eCRF) at each visit along with the reason the medication is taken, dates of use, and dosing regimen.

No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Concurrent procedures will also be collected at each visit.  Concomitant medications and concurrent 
procedures will be tabulated and listed.
Non -live vacc ines may be used during screening or treatment periods, if not contraindicated or 
medically inappropriate.   
 
Any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy should be raised to t he AbbVie nonemergency 
contact.  Information regarding potential drug interactions with BOTOX are in the BOTOX Investigator's 
Brochure.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Vaccination Guidance
Given the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, selected non -live vaccines (e.g., me ssenger RNA, non -replicating 
viral vector, protein subunit , etc. ) to prevent SARS -CoV-2 infection may be administered during 
screening , the treatment period, or follow -up,as long as components of the vaccine are not 
contraindicated.
The decision to receive a locally available vaccine should be based on local guidance and an individual 
discussion between the treating physician and the subject.
 
 
 
 
Any SARS -CoV-2 vaccine information must be documented on the COVID -19 vac cine eCRF.  Refer to the 
Operations Manual for instructions on reporting any AEs associated with the COVID -19 vaccine.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by the IRT at the screening visit.  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial screening visit shoul d be 
used.  The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group 
assignment according to the randomization schedule.
 
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team), t he investigator, study site personnel, and the 
subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the study.  The IRT will provide 
access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical emergency.
At each study site, designated staff member(s) will serve as the Independent Drug Reconstitutor ( IDR).  
This person will be unblinded and will be responsible for study drug preparation and documentation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of the clinical trial.  The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking 
instructions.   
 
 
the investigator is to make every effort to contact AbbVie prior to unblinding a subject's study drug 
assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the subject.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
 
 
 
Upon identification and aw areness of 1 or more of these events, the investigator must document and 
report the event by completing an AE eCRF, and must notify the AbbVie nonemergency contact and 
assigned clinical research associate by email or telephone call within 72 hours of aware ness (if 
non-serious).  The SAE form is not needed unless the AESI is serious.  If the AESI meets SAE criteria 
(which are listed above), it must be reported within 24 hours of awareness per the sponsor's SAE 
reporting requirements 
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AE is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.
Severe The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities 
and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
Page 33 of 71 

STUDY M21 -309  |  V ersion 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologi c 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after t he site 
becomes aware of the pregnancy.   
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is 
considered a nSAE and mu st be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.
Possible Distant Spread of Toxin
Possible distant spread of toxin (PDSOT) is defined as a possible pharmacologic effect of botulinum toxin 
at sites noncontiguous and distan t from the site of injection.  Utilizing a standardized methodology to 
assess for PDSOT, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities PTs that may be associated with 
botulinum toxin effects have been prospectively identified  
 
7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans

STUDY M21 -309  |  V ersion 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.For EU regulatory agencies only, baseline analyses and efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT 
population,  
. 
The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  All safety 
analyses will be performed with subjects analyzed by their actual treatment received.  The Safety 
Analysis Set will be used for all safety analyses.
7.3 Handling Potential Intercu rrent Events for the Primary and 
Secondary Endpoints
The primary composite endpoint for the FDA and the coprimary endpoint for the EU regulatory agencies 
(defined in Section 3.2) will be analyzed based on the ITT population and the mITT population, 
respectively, and the following methods will be used to address potential intercurrent events:
Subjects who did not receive any dose of study drug but are randomized will still be included in 
the ITT population.  
Subjects who are randomized but prematurely discontinued the study before assessment of the 
primary endpoints will be considered as part of the ITT population.  
 
Subjects who die bef ore assessment of the primary endpoint will count as though they 
hypothetically continued in the study.
Subjects who are lost to follow -up and are missing data for the primary endpoint will count as 
though they hypothetically continued in the study.
Subjec ts who are missing assessments or data due to the COVID -19 pandemic and are missing 
data for the primary composite or coprimary endpoints will count as though they hypothetically 
continued in the study.
Subjects who are missing data for any other reason fo r the primary endpoint will count as 
though they hypothetically continued in the study.
The efficacy analysis of secondary endpoints (defined in Section 3.3) will be analyzed based on the same 
populations as above with similar methods for addressing potential intercurrent events.
Missing values will be imputed per the below.
Missing data will be imputed using the following methods for the efficacy analyses:
Multiple Imputation:  The Multiple Imputation approach will be used as a primary analysis for 
the primary endpoint, as well as for all secondary endpoints.  For the primary endpoint (US: 
compos ite endpoint; EU: coprimary endpoints) and the primary measure through Day 120,

No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.EU regulatory agencies:  In addition, the coprimary responder endpoints for at least a 2 -grade 
improvement in the C -APPS and P -APPS separately will be analyzed using the CMH method  
. 
The evaluation of the equality of the proportions of responders for the primary endpoint at Day 14 will 
be based on the CMH test stratified by baseline C -APPS score on Day 1 and by investiga tor site.  A 2 -
sided p -value < 0.05 will be claimed as statistically significant.  
 The 95% CI for 
the treatment risk differences will be constructed using the normal approximation to the binary 
distribution.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variables will be performed t o establish their consistency and 
robustness as well as to further characterize the extent of subjects' responses. 
 
Summary and Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Analysis of the secondary endpoints will be conducted on the ITT population based on treatment as 
randomized for the US FDA analyses and on the mITT popula tion based on treatment as randomized for 
the EU regulatory agencies.
For the secondary endpoints, the proportion of responders will be analyzed using the CMH test  
  The continuous variables will be analyzed using analysis of 
covariance  
 
7.5 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population.  The safety parameters will include 
incidence of AEs and change from ba seline in vital signs.   
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as any AE with theonset that is after the first dose of study drug.   
An overview of AEs will be presented consisting of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
at least one event for each of the following AE categories:
Any TEAE
Any TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
Any TEAE related to study procedure according to the investigator
Any TEAE related to study drug according to the investigator

Any serious TEAE
Any TEAE leading to death
Any AESI
Any PDSOT A E
All deaths
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by system organ class ( SOC)and PT; by maximum 
relationship to study drug as assessed by the investigator (e.g., reasonable possibility or no reasonable 
possibility) and SOC and PT; by maximum severity and SOC and PT; and by subject number and SOC and 
PT.  Specific TEAEs will be counted once for each subject for calculating percentages, unless stated 
otherwise.  In addition, if the same AE occurs multiple times within a subject, the highest sev erity and 
level of relationship to investigational product will be reported.
 
 
  
Vital sign measurements will be summarized for changes from baseline at each assessment timepoint.
7.6 Interim Analysis
Interim analyses are not planned for this study .  
7.7 Overall Type I Error Control
Analyses will be conducted using a gated hierarchical testing procedure to preserve a familywise Type I 
error rate of α =0.05.  
To control the family -wise Type I error rate at 0.05 for multip licity across the primary and secondary 
analyses, a hierarchical testing strategy23will be used.

7.8 Sample Size Determination
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1 ratio yielding approximately 
200 subjects in the BOTOX group and 200 subjects in the placebo group in the treatment period.  
 
For the US FDA primary analysis, an estimated sample size of 360 subjects will give a power of greater 
than 99% to detect a difference in responder rates between the BOTOX and placebo groups, assum ing a 
10% dropout rate by Day 14. 
 
 
The primary analysis for EU regulatory agencies only will be perfor med on the mITT population,  
  
a sample size of 180 will 
result in a power of greater than 99% to detect a difference between BOTOX and placebo in the 
proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2 -grade improvement from baseline according to both 
investigator's assessment using C -APPS and subject's self- assessment using P -APPS at maximum 
contraction at Day 14 .   
 
All calculations are based on a 2 -sided Type I error rate of 0.05.  The power calculation is based on a 
2-sample test of independent proportions, as implemented in the commercial software nQuery 
version 7.0.

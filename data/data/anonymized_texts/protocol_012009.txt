 2. Abstract 
This is a non -randomized, non -interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE  initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women 's Hospital,  Harvard 
Medical School. It is intended to emulate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance  claims data, the SOUL trial described below. Although many features of the 
trial cannot be directly replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and inclusion/e xclusion criteria, were selected to proxy 
those feature s from the trial. Randomization cannot be achieved in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a st atistical balancing of measured covariates 
according to standard practice. Investigators assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment ef fect estimate a nd that failure to replicate RCT f indings 
is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims data for emulation for a range of possible reasons an d does not provide information on the validity of the 
original RCT finding.  
The SOUL trial, which is a superiority trial to evaluate  the effect of oral semaglutide versus placebo on MACE outcomes (CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) 
among individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or chr onic k idney disease (CKD).  
The database study designed to emulate SOUL will be  a new-user active comparative study, where we compare the effect of oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin on 
MACE outcome among patients with T2DM and with establish ed ASCVD and/or CKD.  Sitagliptin was selected to act as an active -comparator proxy for placebo. 
Sitagliptin and the class of dipeptidyl peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors have been demonstrated not to have an effect on MACE in a series of RCTs, and they are  used in 
similar stages  of disease/line of t herapy as semaglutide, as well as being similarly costly.  
The study will use three data sources: Optum  Clinformatics , Merative Marketscan, and Medicare.  
Optum: Study period between 20th Sept 2019 – 29th February 2024  
Marketscan: Study period between 20th Sept 2019 - 31st Dec 202 2 
Medicare: Study period between 20th Sept 2019 – 31st Dec 2020

7th December 
2024  3 6.4.3  Added Nursing home admission as 
one of the censoring reason . This censoring reason  was left 
out of the protocol in error, and 
we are amending it to be 
consistent with our other 
protocols  
16th December 
2024  3.1 Appendices  Added the  FDA protocol review dat es 
for the first and second feasibility  The protocol review dates by 
the FDA were not documented 
in the previous version.   
10th March 
2025  4 Appendices  Covariate code algorithms for Pap 
smear, COPD, pneumonia, and 
diabetic nephropathy were corrected.  Errors in the implementation of 
covariate code algorithms for 
Pap smear, COPD, pneumonia, 
and diabetic nephropathy were 
identified.  
17th April 2025  5 Negative control 
outcomes  Added Hernia and Lumbar 
radiculopathy  Given the ongoing discussion 
around semaglutide and its 
potential association with non -
arteritic anterior ischemic optic 
neuropathy (NAION)  as a 
negative control outcome , we 
5 
 wanted to include alternative 
negative control outcomes.  
  
4.  Rationale and background 
The purpose of this protocol is to specify  the emulation of the  SOUL trial  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Oral semaglutide  became available  on September 20th, 2019 .1 The 
trial enrolled  9,650  participants  between June 17, 2019 – March 24, 2021 . The trial design is event -driven with an expected 3.5 to 5 years follow -up period 
and an assumed outcome rate of 3.5% in the placebo arm. The trial uses 90% power with a 0.025 type 1 error rat e to confirm su periority.2,3 
5.  Research question and objectives 
Table 1 Primary and secondary research questions and objective  
A. Primary research question and objective 
Objective: To evaluate the comparative safety effect of oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin  (proxy for placebo)  on 
MACE outcomes (CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal strok e) in patients with diabetes  and established 
CV or kidney disease  
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that semaglutide will be superior to sitagliptin at preventing MACE  
Popu lation (mention key inclusion-exclusion 
criteria): The study population included p atients aged 50 years or older with type 2 diabetes (T2DM)  and 
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or chronic kidney dis ease (CKD).  
Patients were excluded if they had recent MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or transi ent 
ischemic attack, class IV heart fai lure, prior treatment with GLP -1, history of multiple endocrine 
neoplasia type 2,  medullary thyroid cancer , pancreatitis, bariatric surgery, current or recent 
pregnancy, history of non -melanoma skin cancer, dialysis of sever renal impairmen t, proliferative 
retinopathy or maculopathy requiring treatment, history of diabetic ke toacidosis.  
Exposur e: Oral semaglutide  
Com parator:  Sitagliptin  
Outcome: Major adverse cardiac event (MACE ), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all cause death  
6 
 Time (when follow up begins and ends): 1 days after cohort entry date until the first of outcome, disenrollment, end of study period, 365 days 
after cohort entry date, discontinuation (30 days grace and risk window), switch between the arms, 
start of any other GLP1 agonists (including injectable semaglutide)  
Setting: Patients may be treated in outpatient settings. The outcome will be measured from inpatient 
hospitalizations and/or death.  
Main measure of effect: Hazard ratio  
 
B. Secondary research question 1 and objective 
Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin on negative control 
outcome s, including  A. cataract surgery , B. hernia and C. lumbar radiculopathy  
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that semaglutide will not have a different effect from sitagliptin.  
Popu lation (mention key inclusion-exclusion criteria): The study population included p atients aged 50 years or older with type 2 diabetes 
(T2DM)  and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or chronic 
kidney disease (CKD).  
Patients were excluded if they had recent MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina 
or transient ischemic attack, class IV heart fai lure, prior treatment with GLP -1, history of 
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2,  medullary thyroid cancer , pancreatitis, bariatric 
surgery, current or recent pregnancy, history of non -melanoma skin cancer, dialysis of 
sever renal impairment, proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring treatment, 
history of diabetic ke toacidosis.  In addition, patients were excluded  for baseline hernia 
or lumbar radiculopathy  when  the negative outcome was hernia or lumbar 
radiculopathy  respectively.  
Exposur e: Oral semaglutide  
Com parator:  Sitagliptin  
Outcome: Separate analyses were run for c ataract surgery , hernia , and lumbar radiculopathy  
Time (when follow up begins and ends): 1 days after cohort entry date until the first of outcome, disenrollment, end of study 
period, death, 365 days after cohort entry date, discontinuation (30 days grace and risk 
window), switch between the arms, start of any other GLP1 agonists (including 
injectable semaglutide)  
7 
 Setting: Patients may be treated in outpatient settings. The outcome will be measured using 
procedure codes in an outpatient setting.  
Main measure of effect: Hazard ratio  
 
6.  Research methods 
6.1.  Study design 
Research design (e.g. cohort, case-control, etc.): New user active comparator cohort study  
Rationale for study design choice: The new user active comparator design is a powerful design that may be able to address confounding by 
indication. It accomplishes this, in large part, through judicious selection o f an appropriate active-comparator group.4,5 While selection of an 
appropriate comparator in the design phase is crucial, cohort studie s often require additional adjustment of measurable confounders. A common 
method for adjusting for confounding is via a propensity score (PS).

 6.2.  Study design diagram 
 
Note: The CV disease inclusion may include acute MI codes but any acute MI in the 60 days is excluded. History of heart failu re is an inclusion criterion, but heart failure class IV is excl uded.

 6.3.  Setting 
6.3.1 Context and rationale for definition of time 0 (and other primary time anchors) for entry to the stud y population  
Time 0 in the database study was defined to emulate randomization to oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin  in the clinical trial design. See appendix tables 1 and 2 a 
for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms . 
6.3.2 Context and rationale for stud y inclusion criteria:  
Study inclusion criteria were defined to emulate the inclusion criteria for the trial. See appendix tables 1 and 2 for operat ional definitions and d etailed code 
algorithms . See appendix tables 1 and 2b for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms . 
A flowchart of the study cohort assembly is provided in Appendix 3.  
6.3.3 Context and rationale for study exclusion criteria 
Study exclusion criteria were defined to emulate the exclusion criteria for the trial. See appendix tables 1 and 2 for operational definitions and d etailed code 
algorithms . See appendix tables 1 and 2c for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms . 
A flowchart of the study cohort assembly is provided in Appendix 3.  
6.4.  Variables 
6.4.1 Context and rationale for exposure(s) of interest 
The exposure and comparator were defined to emulate the agents compared  for the trial , oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin. See appendix tables 1 and 2 a for 
operational definitions and detailed code algorithms .  
Algorithm to define duration of exposur e effect:  
Assuming the effect of  the drug lasts for 30 days after the days’ supply, we allow 30 days gap between th e dispensation (grace period) and also add 30 days 
at the end of days’ supply of dispensation (exposure risk window) .  
6.4.2 Context and rationale for outcome(s) of interest 
The primary outcome for the database study was defined to emulate the primary outcome for the trial  of MACE . In the trial, this was a combination of myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. In our e mulation, due to inability to capture cause of death, o ur modified MACE  outcome was measured as inpatient 
myocardial infarction, inpatient stroke, and all-cause mortality. See appendix tables 1 and 2 d for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms . Optum 
includes  death  information from the inpatient discharged dead status, s ocial security death master file, and deaths scraped f rom obituaries or other sources.  
MarketScan includes information from the inpatient disc harged dead status up until 2016.  Medicare includes information from the inpatient discha rged dead 
10 
 status, NDI cause of death, and social security death master file.  The positive predictive value for the myocardial infarction outcome algorithm using ICD -9 codes 
was observed to be 88.4% and 94% in validation studies.6,7 The PPV for the ischemic stroke outcome algorithm was 88% and 95% in validation studies usin g ICD9 
codes.6,8 The ICD9 code algorithms were mapped to ICD10 codes and reviewed by a clinician, but the perform ance of the mapped codes was not further 
validated.  
 
Secondary outcomes from the trial that will be evaluated include  components of the MACE outcome including : 
1. Myocardial infarction  
2. Stroke  
3. All cause Death  
Control outcomes of interest include:  
1. Cataract surgery. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide versus sitagli ptin. 
2. Hernia. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide versus sitaglip tin. 
3. Lumbar radiculopathy. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide  versus sitagliptin.  
6.4.3 Context and rationale for follow up  
Both on -treatment (OT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted. Adherence in clinical practice databases is expected to be much worse than in th e trial, 
Therefore the  OT analysis will be the primary analysis . The OT analysis  targets the relative hazard of outcomes while on treatment and may more close ly emulate the 
effect observed in highly adherent trial participants.

6.4.4 Cont ext and rationale for covariates (confounding variables and effect modifiers, e.g. risk factors, comorbidities, comedications) 
We identified a series of covariates that were likely confounders d ue to being strong risk factors for the primary outcome that were associated with choice of 
treatment. These include demographics, disease severity related variables, como rbid conditions, comedications, frailty, healthcare utilization and markers of 
health  seeking behaviour.

 6.5.  Data anal ysis 
6.5.1 Context and rationale for anal ysis plan  
The study will use a propensity score (PS) 1:1 nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0.01 on the propensity sc ore scale . The PS will be estimated as the 
probability of initiating  oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin given the baseline patient characteristics using multivariable logistic regression models. As diagnostics for 
PS models, the study will evaluate covariate balance using standardized differences and c -statistics post -matching.  The study will estimate the hazard ratio for oral 
semaglutide versus sitagliptin on MACE outcome in the matched  population using a Cox proportional hazards model.  
Table 4. Primary, seconda ry, and subgroup analysis specification 
A. Primary anal ysis 
Hypothesis: Oral semaglutide might decrease risk of MACE outcome compared to sitagliptin in those with diabetes  and established CV 
disease  
Exposure contrast: Oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin  
Outcome: MACE  
Anal ytic software:  Aetion, STATA 17, SAS 9.4 , R.4.4.0  
Model(s): 
(provide details or code)  Outcome model: Cox proportional hazards  
Follow -up time*status(0) = exposure  
Conf oundi ng adjustment method   Name method and provide relevant details, e.g. bivariate, multivariable, propensity score matching (specify matching algorithm 
ratio and caliper), propensity score weighting (specify weight formula, trimming, truncation), propensity score stratification 
(specify strata definition), other.  
1:1 Propensity score  nearest -neighbor  matching with a caliper of 0.01 on the propensity sc ore scale.  
 
Missing data methods   Name method and provide relevant details, e.g. missing indicators, complete case, last value carried forward, multiple 
imputation (specify model/variables), other. 
     Assumption that if no relevant claims diagnoses/procedures are present, the condition is not present  
Subgroup Anal yses List all subgroups 
 n/a 
 
B. Secondary Analysis 1  
Hypothesis: Oral semaglutide has no effect on risk of negative control outcomes compared to sitagliptin. Negative control  outcomes 
include: A.  cataract surgery , B. hernia, C. lumbar radiculopathy  
Exposure contrast: Oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin  
Outcome: Separate analyses were run for each negative control outcome, including cataract surgery , hernia and lumbar

population 
distribution  We will re -weight the 
population distribution of the 
pooled database study 
cohorts to reflect that of the 
RCT if that information is 
made public prior to 
publication of our results.  We will learn about potential 
effect modification due to 
different distributions of key 
characteristics such as 
age/sex in the RCT versus the 
database study.  The population distributions will 
be more aligned.  The measurement of these 
population characteristics may be 
measured differently in the RCT vs 
database study, with different 
levels of specificity and sensitivity.  
Negative control 
outcomes, including 
cataract surgery , 
hernia, lumbar 
radiculopathy  We evaluate  negative control 
outcomes of cataract surgery,  
hernia, and lumbar 
radiculopathy , where no 
causal effect is expected from 
semaglutide  or sitagliptin  We will evaluate the potential 
impact of residual 
confounding on this outcome 
for which there is not 
expected to be a causal effect  The evaluates the robustness of 
the interpretation of the primary 
analysis by evaluating the 
potential magnitude of 
unmeasured confounding  This analysis assumes that the 
confounding structure is the same

outcome as the outcome of interest  
PS-adjustment 
method  Instead of 1:1 PS matching, 
we will use PS fine

Apply benchmark,

sensitivity and tipping 
point analysis  We will use the observed 
difference in result from 
emulation of SUSTAIN6 to 
recalibrate the result from the 
database study emulation of 
PIONEER6. We will conduct a 
tipping point analysis with a 
range of plausible estimates 
of the expected difference.  We expect to learn about the 
performance of BenchExCal in 
an example where we emulate 
an RCT for an expanded 
indication and an RCT result 
for the expanded indication is 
available.  The analysis will calibrate the 
primary result based on expected 
differences due to bias and/or 
design emulation differences and 
propagate uncertainty regarding 
the impact of these factors into 
the frequentist primary result  The ability to appropriately calibrate 
the result depends on how “close” 
the clinical context is between the 
initial and expanded indication. The 
approach assumes that the net 
effect of bias and design emulation 
differences is the similar.  
 
6.6.  Data sources 
6.6.1 Context and rationale for data sources 
Reas on for selection: The study will be conducted in 3  US health care claims databases: Optum  Clinformatics  (2019 -Feb 2024), Merative Marketscan (2019 -
2022) and Medicare ( a sample that includes all patients with diabetes or heart failure diagnosis, 2019 -2020) . 
Strengths of data source(s): Each data source contains deidentified, longitudinal, date -stamped information on patient enrollment , demographics, 
inpatient/outpatient diagnosis and procedures, admission a nd discharge dates,  and medication dispensation. The death data is captured in the Optum database 
from inpatient discharge status, social security death master file, and deaths scra ped from obituaries or other sources. The death data in MarketScan is captured 
from the social security death master file and inpatient discharge status. It is recognized that the social security death master file has hig h specificity and positive 
predictive value for deaths. While this data resource has under captured deaths since 2011, the captu re of deaths is not expected to be differential between 
compared exposure groups. The death data is captured in the Medicare database from inpatient discharge status,  and social security death master file.13-15  
Limitations of data source(s): Patient healthcare encounters are only observable when they are enrolled in an insurance plan that contributes to the databas e. 
Patients may change insurance plans for multiple reasons. Both Optum Clinformatics and Merative MarketScan are primarily empl oyer based insurance 
databases where patients may disenroll with job changes. Patients in Medicare may  move in and out of fee -for-service plans. We are excluding person -time in 
health maintenance organization (HMO) plans due to concerns about the c ompleteness of capture of diagnoses and procedures. This means that we require 
27 
 patients to be enrolled in Medicare parts AB and D during the baseline assessment window and censo r patients if they switch t o part C. In claims data, dispensing 
data for inpatient medication is unavailable. Diagnoses reflect billing practic es, therefore algorithms (preferably validated) are needed for accurate phenotyping  of 
patient conditions.  Services that are not covered by insurance do not appear in the data. The trial evaluated cardiovascular deaths, however we will evaluate all 
cause death in the em ulation because  most deaths in this cohort of patients at high cardi ovascular risk will be related to cardiovascular re asons, the cause of 
death is not recorded for databases not linked to NDI, and the performance of NDI at identifying cardiovascular causes of death may be suboptimal.15 
Data source provenanc e/curation:  
Information about Optum Clinformatics and Merative MarketScan can be found in data dictionaries and user guides that are provided to clients. I nforma tion about 
Medicare data provenance and curation can be found on the ResDac website .16

6.7.  Data manag ement 
Tracking data:  The Data Use Agreement (DUA) Custodian (Principal Investigator) and the Division Ope rations Manager (Winta Tekle) are respons ible for receiving 
and creating a record of new data associated with the given request. The Operations Manager is responsible for a ll indexing and archiving of documents and 
28 
 electronic media related to data that the Division receives  and will log data location, data contents, and associated DUA and Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
numbers in the Division’s centralized tracking system . 
Handling and storage: In-scope data will be stored utilizing Mass General Brigham approved information systems – i.e., Division servers and Mass General 
Brigham network storage.  
Archiving : Data retention and any removal will be executed by the Division Operations Manager (Winta Tekle) and Data Manager (Todd MacGarvey). The Divisi on 
follows Mass General Brigham enterprise record retention policies and follow the term s of the agreement through which the in -scope data was received.  
Information security: The Division follows Mass General Brigham’s Enterprise Information Security Program (EISP). The EISP h elps by providing assur ance that 
Mass General Brigham information and information systems  are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure , duplica tion, modification, or destruction in 
order to maintain their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. To th at end, the EISP policies, standards and procedure s create an information security framework 
that is aligned with the rec ommendations of the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) publication 27001 and the National Institute of St andards 
and Technology’s (NIST) publication 800 -53 Family of Controls and MGB regulatory and legal requirements (as a HIPAA covered  entity).  
 
Mass General Brigham workforce members are required to c omplete new workforce privacy and information security  training upon hire and annually thereafter. 
Refresh training is provided as appropriate. Mass General Brigham workforce m embers are required to review and sign a Confidentiality Agreement upon hire and 
annually thereafter. Additionally, we follow Enterprise Information Security and Privacy policies,  including Managing Workfor ce Members Information Security 
Responsibilities Policy, which was developed to help assure that Mass General Brigham workforce members are competent and eligible to support the informat ion 
security responsibilities associated with their role. Mass General Brigham workforce, including D ivision staff, are required to comply with Enterprise Information 
Security and Privacy Policies.  
 
Facilities:  The research team uses a highly secure, state -of-the-art, computing facility housed at Mass General Brigham’s Corporate Data Centers in Needham and 
Marlborough, Massachusetts  as well as Amazon Web Services (AWS).  We maintain redundant storage for maximal data integrity and high -speed data access.  
The Division uses Mass General Brigham corporate provisioned servers to analyze and store data in c onnection with this projec t. There are strict access controls 
enforced by technical means to ensure that only study staff who have been approved t o conduct d ata analyses and contracted data engineers are able to access 
data (e.g., Mass General Brigham Authentication (Active Directory) utilized; auditing, logging, and monitoring enabled; firew alls enabled; etc.). All Division servers 
used in this study are acce ssible to only authorized staff only through the MGB network and utilizing VPN as appropriate (i. e., users must be on the net work and 
logged into VPN to access). Mass General Brigham has a network info rmation security monitoring team and in -scope servers a re enrolled in enterprise security 
tools (e.g., vulnerability scanning service, antivirus, etc.).   
The Division also uses AWS. In -scope AWS services / resources have undergone review and assessment by Mass General Brigham’s Informatio n Security Risk 
Assessment Team/ InfoSec Risk Management Team as required and in alignment with NIST 800 -30: Guide for Co nducting Risk Assessments. In -scope AWS 
servers are for our exclusive use (reserved instances), are covered under our organization’ s Business Associate Agreement wit h AWS. In -scope servers are housed 
in anonymous facilities that are not branded as AWS fac ilities. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimet er and at building ingress points by 
professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means.  
Security attributes and controls for the Division’s use of in -scope AWS in connection with this project include: encryption at rest and in transit (industry standard 
AES-256 encryption, SSL/TSL), anti -malware, latest OS updates and patches as well as an ti-virus; multi -factor authentication (MFA), Identity and Access 
29 
 Management, including SSO; auditing and logging; princi ple of least privilege, including for traffic and po rts (e.g., deny al l default configurations), use of VPC 
enabled Step functions, etc.; separation between environments; minimum necessary (out of the box AWS roles are not used as they can be overly permissive); all 
data would reside in the US domestic regions – use only US east HIPAA compliant region; performance monitoring enabled and reviewed as per internal 
processes; passwords compliant with enterp rise password policy and, as appropriate, more protective password requirements; etc. Our Division’s AWS use is also 
subject to ongoing evaluation and monitoring as well – e.g., vulnerability scanning and management, access review, etc.  
A data file list will be maintained in Amazon S3 and tracked through Cloudtrail and Cloudwatch. Reporti ng of data file availa bility for any file stored in an S3 bucket 
will be controlled by MGB.  
Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC are integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS 
service in Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon EC2, Ama zon EBS, and Amazon VPC as events, including calls 
from the console and from code calls to the APIs. MGB IT/security staff have full access to Clou dTrail to ensure that CloudTr ail monitoring is available at all times. 
Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a ne ar-real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Amazon Cloud Trail can log, continuously 
monitor, and retain account activity related to acti ons across the MGB AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail pro vides event history of MGB AWS account activity. This 
event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting and complies with requirements to e nsure the data file inventory is 
controlled by MGB.  
Backups : Backups are created using industry recognized Cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., 256 -bit AES encryption) as appropriate and required. Data are backed 
up within the MGB network from the MGB Needham data center to the MGB Marlborough data center via replicatio n/mirroring and volume -level snapshots.  AWS 
Backup supports both instance -level backups as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and volume -level backups as separate snapshots based on the resource tags. 
AMIs allow MGB IT and security staff to create backup s of all S3 and EC2 instances. This backup approach allows elimination of EC2 instances when access to 
CMS data files is no longer needed. Use of temporary instances will allow highest security control to be applied regarding for whom and when CMS data fil es are 
accessible.  
In addition to the safeguards listed above, the Division follows enter prise privacy and information security policies and mai ntains internally procedures in 
connection with this project to safeguard the data in connection with this project as appropriate a nd required including: Physical Security and Environmental 
Controls for Electronic Information Policy; IT Access Control Standards for Users policy; Safeguarding Fax Copiers Printers T elephone Use and Pagers; Physical 
Removal and Transport of Protected Hea lth Information and Personal Information policy, etc.  
 
6.8.  Quality control 
Senior Programmers and Research Specialists perform QA/QC on raw or common data model converted data via SAS/R/Aetion software. The protocol will be 
iteratively developed and pre -specified data checks including feasibility counts and balance on baseline covariates will be cond ucted with outputs reviewed  by 
both MGB and FDA team members. Team members will review code lists to ensure fide lity to intended  algorithms.

 6.9.  Study size and feasibility 
First feasibility assessment: Details of power calculations after applying eligibility criteria and mat ching on ages, sex and comorbidity score are available in  appendix 
4. 
Second feasibility assessment: Details of power calculations after matching or weighting on all predefined propensity score variables  are available in appendix 5. 
Propensity score distribution plots with c -statistics are available in appendix 6. Table 1 showing prevalence of baseline characteristics and standardized differences in 
distribution are available in appendix 7.  
7.  Limitation of the methods 
As we are using secondary data and the data were not collected for research, some important variables may not be collected or will be measu red imperfectly. We 
have selected validated algorithms when possible and we have created proxies for important v ariables that are not directly ca ptured in the data to red uce 
confounding by unmeasured factors . One measurement difference is for the primary outcome, where for the RCT, MACE was def ined as stroke, myocardial infarction, 
and cardiovascular death, whereas in our database study, it is defined as stroke, myocardial  infarction, and all cause death.  
When comparing results from an RCT to a database study that emulates the design, we assume that the findings from the single RCT are internally valid which is not 
guaranteed.  
Although we plan to emulate the important features of each RCT as closely as possible in healthcare claims, t here may be some  elements of RCT design that are not 
emulable with a database study, which means that the RWE and RCT will address slightly different clinical questions.  For example, in routine clinical care, adherence 
to treatment is typically not as high as it is in an RCT with strong measures in  place to encourage adherence to the study pr otocol. This means that there is more 
discontinuation and s hort-term medication use in the patients identified in claims databases than trial participants.  
Apparent agreement between RCT and database study results could occur if the effects of multiple factors (chance, em ulation d ifferences, bias) cancel each other 
out.

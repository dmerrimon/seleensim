Title : A Phase 1/2 Multi -Center Study  Evaluating the Safety  and Efficacy  of 
KTE- X19 in Adult Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory  B-precursor
Acute Ly mphoblastic Leukemia (r/r ALL) (ZUMA -3)
Indication : The indication is for the treatment of adult subjects with B-precursor r/r 
ALL .
Study Design : ZUMA -3 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open- label study  evaluating the 
safet y and efficacy of KTE -X19 in adult subjects with relapsed or 
refractory  B-precursor ALL.  In this study , relapsed or refractory  is 
defined as one of the following: primary  refractory ;first relapse 
following a remission lasting ≤ 12 months; relapsed or refractory  after 
second -line or higher therapy ;relapsed or refractory  after allogenic 
SCT (provided the transplant occurred ≥100 day s prior to enrollment 
and that no immunosuppressive medications were taken ≤ 4 weeks 
prior to enrollment). 
Phase 1 Study
During Phase 1, approximately  3-12 subjects with high burden [M3 
marrow (>25% leukemic blasts) or ≥1000 blasts/mm3in the peripheral 
circulation] r/r ALL disease who are evaluable for D LT will be 
assessed to evaluate the safet y of KTE -X19.  A safety  review team 
(SRT) that is internal to the study  sponsor, and in collaboration with at 
least 1 study  investigator, will review safety  data and make 
recommendations regarding further enrollment in Phase 1 or 
proceeding to Phase 2 based on the incidence of DLTs and overall 
safet y profile of KTE
-X19.  Up to approximately  40 additional subjects 
with high or low burden disease may  be enrolled to further assess 
safet y (see Figure 1, Section 3.1and Section 9.6).  
Phase 2  Study
During Phase 2, approximately  50 subjects in the modified- intention to 
treat (mITT) set will be assessed to evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of 
KTE- X19.   
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review 
safet y data through one interim anal ysis during the Phase 2 portion of 
the study .  In this interim anal ysis, the DSMB will review safet y data 
after 20 Phase 2 subjects have been treated with KT E-X19 and had the 
opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after the KTE -X19 infusion.  
Each subject will provide consent and be evaluated for study 
participation.  Once deemed eligible and enrolled into the study , each 
subject will follow the same study  treatment schedule and procedural 
requirements, independent of the phase of the study , and proceed 
through the following study  periods:

Study Objectives : Phase 1 Study
The primary  objective of Phase 1 is to evaluate the safet y of KTE -X19.  
Phase 2 Study
The primary  objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the efficacy  of 
KTE- X19, as measured by the overall complete remission rate defined 
as complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete 
hematologic recovery  (CRi) in adult subjects with r/r ALL 
(Appendix 1).  Secondary objectives will include assessing the safet y 
and tolerability  of KTE -X19 and additional efficacy  endpoints.
Hypothesis: This study  is designed to differentiate between a treatment that has a 
true overall complete remission rate of 40% or less and a treatment 
with a true overall complete remission rate of 65 %or more. The 
hypothesis is that the overall complete remission ra te to KTE -X19 is 
significantl y greater than 40%.
Primary 
Endpoints :Phase 1: I ncidence of adverse events (AEs) defined as dose -
limiting toxicities (DL Ts) in the DLT evaluable set
Phase 2:  Overall complete remission rate (CR + CRi) per 
independent review (Appendix 1)
Secondary 
Endpoints :Overall complete remission rate (CR + CRi) per investigator 
assessment ( Appendix 1)
Duration of Remission (DOR)
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative rate
Allogeneic stem cell transplant (Allogeneic SCT) rate
Overall survival (OS)
Relapse -free Survival (RFS)

with high or low burden disease may  be enrolled to further assess 
safet y (see Figure 1, Section 3.1and Section 9.6).  
During Phase 2, approximately  50 subjects in the modified -intention to 
treat (mITT) set will be assessed to evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of 
KTE
-X19.   
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review 
safet y data through one interim anal ysis during the Phase 2 portion of 
the study .  In this interim anal ysis, the DSMB will review safet y data 
after 20 Phase 2 subjects have been treated with KT E-X19 and had the 
opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after the KTE -X19 infusion.  
Statistical 
ConsiderationsThe primary  endpoint for the Phase 2 study  is the overall complete 
remission rate (CR and CRi) per independent review ( Appendix 1).  
This endpoint will be based on a mITT population consisting of 
all 
Phase 2 subjects who receive KTE -X19 dose (see Section 10.5).  
This study  uses a single-arm design to test for an improvement in 
overall complete remission rate.  For the test of efficacy  this study  has 
approximately  93% power to distinguish between an active therapy  
with a 65 %true overall complete remission rate from a therapy  with an 
overall complete remission rate of 40% or less with a 1
-sided alpha 
level of 0.025.  
During Phase 1, the SRT will review safety  data after 3 subjects in t he 
DLT evaluable set (see Section 10.5) have had the opportunity  to be 
followed for 28 day s after the KTE -X19 infusion (see Section 9.6).  
During Phase 2, one interim and one primary  analy sis will be 
performed.  The interim anal ysis is for safety  only and will be 
performed b y the DSMB after 20 Phase 2 subjects have been treated 
with KTE -X19 and had the opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after 
the KTE -X19 infusion.  Additional interim analy ses for safet y ma
y be 
requested b y the DSMB.  
The primary  anal ysis will occur when the overall study  enrollment is 
complete and the last treated subject in the mITT set has had the 
opportunity  to complete the month 6 disease assessment.  
A secondary  endpoint, MRD -negative rate, will be tested against an 
MRD -negative rate of 30% if the testing of the prima ry endpoint is 
significant.

The primary  objective of Phase 1 is to evaluate the safet y of KTE -X19.  
The primary  objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the efficacy  of KTE -X19, as measured by  the 
overall complete remission rate defined as complete remission (CR) and complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic rec overy  (CRi) in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory  B-precursor 
acute l ymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL) .  Secondary  objectives will include assessing the safet y 
and tolerability  of KTE- X19,additional efficacy  endpoints, and change in EQ -5D scores .

2_ DISEASE BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.2. Diagnosis and Subtyping of ALL 
Diagnos is of A LL requires at least 20% l ymphoblasts in the bone man ow (Harris et al, 1999 ). 
ALL is then further classified into 1 of 3 m ajor subtypes by immun ophenotyp ing: B-precursor 
ALL (70%), mature B-cell ALL (Burki tt lymphoma; 5%), and T- cell ALL (25%) . B-cell ALLs 
are generally CDIO +, CD19+, and CD79a+, although precursor B-cell ALL s may be C D10 -. 
Mature B-cell ALLs additionally express surface immun oglobulin (lg). T-cell ALL s express 
T-cell markers such as CD3, C D4, and CD8. The 3 immun ophenotypic subtypes are assoc iated 
with no n-overlappin g prognoses and ti·eatments making the class ification clini cally rel evant 
(National Comp rehensi ve Cance r Netwo rk 2014). B-precursor ALL compri ses the m ajority of 
all adult ALL cases . 
2.3. Philadelphia Positive vs. Negative ALL 
Approximately 20-30% of adults and a sma ll percentage of childr en w ith ALL are Philadelphia 
chrom osome positive (Ph+), and the m ajority of Ph+ cases are of B-cell lineage (Lee et al, 2011). 
Ph+ status confers poor prognosis, with a 5- year event-free smv iv al (EFS) rate of 36% vs 16% 
and an OS rate of 41 % vs. 22% in Philadelphia chrom osome n egative (Ph-) vs. Ph+ patients 
(Moonnan et al, 2007 ). Ph+ status also allows for additional ti·eatment with Abl tyros ine kinase 
inhibitors (TKis) such as imatinib or dasat inib. 
2.4. Treatment and Progno sis 
Seve ral anti-n eoplastic agents are given in vaiying doses and schedules based on r egional 
preferences and patient tolerability in 3 distinct ph ases for 1st line ti·eatmen t: induction, 
intensified consolidation, and ma intenance. Centi· al ne1vous syste m (CNS) prophylaxis 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 100 31 October 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 18of 100 31October 2018accompanies induction and consolidation.  The goals of treatment are to reconstitute normal 
hematopoiesis, prevent emergence of resistant subclones, eliminate minimal residual disease, and
provide proph ylaxistosanctuary  sites.  Stem cell tra nsplant also play s a role in the management 
of ALL, and t yrosine kinase inhibitors are added to chemotherap y and transplant regimens in 
patients with Ph+disease.
2.4.1. First -line Treatment
Most first- line regimens are a variation of either the B erlin-Frankfurt -Münster /Children’s 
Oncology  Group (BFM/COG) regimens, which include a combination of vincristine, an 
anthracy cline, a corticosteroid, and L -asparaginase, or the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 
(CALGB )regimens, which include the 4 drug classes above plus cy clo phosphamide (Larson et 
al, 1995 ; Rowe et al, 2005).  A TKI such as imatinib is included in the treatment regimen for 
patients with Ph+disease.  Dexamethasone appears to decrease the risk of CNS relapse and 
improve EFS compared to prednisone, but at the risk of increased toxicity  and no OS advantage
(Mitchell C. D. et al, 2005 ; Pui 2006 ).  The hy per-CVAD regimen which has demonstrated 
efficacy  in ALL is a variation on the CAL GB regimen with alternating regimens of 
hyperfractionated cy clophosphamide, vincr istine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone with high-
dose methotrexate and cytarabine (Kantarjian et al, 2004 ).  First -line regimens y ield CR rates of 
80-90% in adults.  Despite the high CR rates and a median duration  of first remission of at least 
18 months, most patients eventuall y relapse. 
2.4.2. Second- line and Beyond Treatment
The salvage setting represents the area of greatest need in adult ALL given the poor outcomes 
achieved with chemotherapy  in adults who have relapsed or refractory  ALL.  Second -line 
chemotherap y yields remissions in about 20-40% of patients, with the remission rate being lower 
in patients who relapse within 12 months of an ini tial response (Table 1).  
In the third line and bey ond setting, complete remissions with chemotherapy  are seen in at most 
20% of patients, and the majority  of remissions are short lived (Thomas et al, 1999 ; Kantarjian et 
al, 2003 ; Fielding et al, 2007
; Tavernier et al, 2007 ; Faderl et al, 2011 ; O'Brien et al, 2013).  
Although long -term disease free survival ( DFS)rates of autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT)are superior to chemotherap y in the salvage setting (approximately 40% vs 20%), onl y 
30-40% of patients who achieve a second CR are eligible for SCT, and fewer than half of the 
patients who achieve a second CR have enough time prior to relapse to make it to transplant
(Herzig et al, 1987 ; Kolb et al, 2009 ; Terwey  et al, 2009 ), with rates as low as 5% in adults being 
reported in some series (Thomas et al, 1999 )
.  
In December 2014, the bispecific CD19 -directed CD3 T -cell engaging agent blinatumomab was 
granted accelerated approval in the US for the treatment of Ph-relapsed or refractory  B-cell 
precursor ALL (blinatumomab USPI ).  The approval was granted based primarily  on findings 
from a single -arm study  of 185 evaluable patients w ith r/rB-precurso r ALL (relapsed with first 
remission duration of ≤12 months in first salvage or relapsed or refractory  after first salvage 
therap y or relapsed within 12 months of SCT).  CR was achieved in 32% of patients, and an 
additional 9% had CR h.  The majority of responses (81%) occurred within cy cle 1 of treatment, 
75% of those with CR/CRh had an minimum residual disease ( MRD )
-negative response, and the 
SCT rate among those who achieved CR/CRh was 39%.  Duration of response/relapse -free 
survival in patients who had CR/CRh was 5.9 months.  Results from a second study  of

versus 1 of 4 s tandard of care (SOC) chem otherapy regiments, have also recently b een repo1 ied. 
A total of 405 patients were rando mized, and a pr especified interim analysis occuned after 
248 deaths. Med ian OS was 7.8 mon ths (95% CI: 5.7, 10.0) for blinatumomab and 4.0 months 
(95% CI: 2.9, 5.4) for SOC (p=.011; hazard ratio=0.71), sm pass ing the pr espec ified boundai y p 
value of 0.01 83. Based on th ese r esults, this study was terminated early upon the 
recommendation of the study's Data Safety Monitoring Boai· d (Topp and al 2016 ). No studies 
have yet repo1 ied the outco mes of patients in the post-blinatumomab setting.

Several studies have shown that the achievement of a minimum residual disease ( MRD )-negative 
response (<0.01% l ymphoblasts in the bone marrow) with ALL treatment is associated with 
prolonged leukemia remission in both pediatric and adult ALL patients (Campana 2010; 
Cazzaniga et al, 2011 ).  However, not all subjects who achieve a morphological complete 
remission achieve a MRD -negative remission.  I n a large study  by the Children’s Oncology  
Group randomizing p atients to different induction and maintenance regimens, 1788 o f
2422 
(74%) of subjects who had a remission (<10% bone marrow blasts) achieved MRD -negative 
status 
(Borowitz et al, 2015 ).  Treatment with the bispecific T cell engager blinatumomab 
produces a similar proportion of MRD-negative responses, 8 of 14 (53%) pediatric patients with 
a CR had an MRD -negative response {von Stackelberg 2016}.  Minimum residual disease-
negative rates are similar in adults.  With blinatumomab, 60 o f73 (82%) adult patients who 
achieved a CR or CRh had an MRD
-negative response.
2.5. Study Rationale
Most advanced cancers eventually  become refractory  to conventional therapies and new 
treatment modalities are needed.  Immunotherap y, which is based on the enhan cement of an 
immune response against the tumor, is a promising approach to treating many  cancer t ypes.  
Tcells play  an important role in destroy ing diseased cells throughout the body .  Studies with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors and tumor infiltrating l ymphocy tes have demonstrated the 
potential of T cells to treat cancer.  T cells need to possess the appropriate specificit y for a tumor, 
be present in sufficient numbers, and overcome any  local immunosuppressive factors to be 
effective.  Engineered T cells are a promising approach for cancer therap y (Kershaw et al, 2013
).
Engineered Autologous Cell Therap y (eACT ™) is a process b y which a patient’s own T cells are 
collected and subsequently  genetically  altered to recognize and target antigens expressed on the 
cell surface of specific malignancies (Kochenderfer et al, 2013 )
. The ability to geneticall y 
engineer human T cells and use them to mediate cancer regression in patients has been 
demonstrated in a number of studies (Davila et al, 2014 ; Maude et al, 2014 ; Lee et al, 2015 )and 
has opened possibilities for the treatment of patients with a wide vari ety of cancer t ypes 
including B-cellmalignancies expressing the CD19 antigen.
Given the poor outcomes which have been achieved to date in adults with r/rALL (Table 1 ), this 
trial will enroll adult s ubjects with r/rB-precursor ALL as evidenced b y failure to achieve or 
maintain a response to prior sy stemic therapy , or by  recurrence after allogeneic SCT.Patients 
with T -cell lineage ALL will not be enrolled since their malignancies are CD19-and will likely
not resp
ond to a CD19 directed agent.  
2.5.1. CD19 and E xpression
CD19 is a 95 kD transmembrane protein e xpressed only  in the B- celllineage. It is expressed in 
all norma l B cells starting at the pre -B cell stage until the final differentiation stage and is not 
expressed in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells or most plasma cells.  The pattern of CD19 
expression is maintained in B
-cellmalignanc ies including all subt ypes of B-cellnon-Hodgkin 
lymphoma ( NHL ), chronic ly mpho cytic leukemia (CLL), and non 
T-cellacute ly mpho blastic 
leukemia (ALL) (Blanc et al, 2011) with the exception of multiple my eloma.

3.1. General Study Design
ZUMA -3 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open- label study  evaluating the safet y and efficacy of 
KTE- X19 in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory  B-precursor ALL. In this study , relapsed 
or refractory  is defined as one of the following: primary  refractory ; first relapse following a 
remission lasting ≤ 12 months; relapsed or refractory  after second- line or higher 
therap y;relapsed or refractory  after allogenic SCT (provided the transplant occurred ≥ 100 day s 
prior to enrollment and that no immunosuppressive medications were taken ≤ 4 weeks prior to 
enrollment) . 
During Phase 1, approximately  3-12 subjects with high burden [M3 marrow (> 25% leukemic 
blasts) or 
≥1000 blasts/mm3in the peripheral circulation] r/r ALL disease who are evaluable for 
DLT will be assessed to evaluate the safet y of KTE -X19. A SRT that is internal to the study  
sponsor, and in collaboration with at least 1 study  investigator, will review safet y data and make 
recommendations regarding further enrollment in Phase 1 or proceeding to Phase 2 based on the 
incidence of DLTs and overall safety profile of KTE -X19.  Additional ly, approximately  
40
subjects with high or low b urden disease may  be enrolled to further assess safet y(see 
Figure 1and Section 9.6).  
During Phase 2, approximately  50 subjects in the mI TT set will be assessed to evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y of KTE -X19.  
In total, up to approximately  100 subjects may  be enrolled and treated with KTE -X19 in the 
study  in Phase 1 and 2 combined (see Section 9.6and Section 10.5).  
During Phase 2, oneinterim and one primary  analy sis will be performed.  The i nterim anal ysis is 
for safety  only and will be performed b y an independent DSMB after 20 Phase 2 subjects hav e 
been treated with KTE- X19 andhad the opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after the 
KTE- X19 infusion (see Section 10.7).  Additional interim a nalyses for safety  may  be requested 
by the DSMB.  
The primary  anal ysis will occur when the overall study  enrollment is complete and the last 
treated subject in the mITT set has had the opportunity  to complete the month 6 disease 
assessment (see Section 10.8).  
Each subject will provide consent and be evaluated for study participation. Once deemed 
eligible and enrolled into the study , each subject 
will follow the same study treatment schedule 
and procedural requirements, independent of the phase of the stud y, and proceed through the 
following stud y periods:
Screening period

3.4. Replacement of Subjects
Subjects will continue to be enrolled until the specified numbers of subjects are attained in the 
DLT evaluable ( Phase 1) and mITT sets ( Phase 2).
Subjects who have not received the required dose of KTE- X19 in order to be included in DLT 
evaluable set will be retained in the anal yses of disposition and safety , where appropriate (see 
Section 10.5). 
3.5. Study Duration
3.5.1. Study Duration for Individual S ubjects 
The duration of the stud y for individual subjects will vary . For a subject who completes the 
entire 
protocol from the date of in formed consent through the completion of the long term 
follow -up pe riod, the duration of the study  will t ake approximately  15 y earstocomplete.
However, individual study duration will vary  depending on a subject’s scree ning requirements, 
response to treatment and survival.
The need for prolonged follow -
up is based on the potential persistence of gene transfer vectors in 
treated subjects.
3.5.2. Completion of Study
Completion of the study  is defined as the time at which all enr olled subject scomplete the long 
term follow -up period visit, is considered lost to follow- up, withdra ws consent, or dies.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 26of 100 31October 20184. SUBJECT SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT
All subjects must sign and date the IRB/ IECapproved consent form before initiating any  study  
specific procedures or activities that are not part of a subject ’s routine care . Refer to Section 7
for details.
Each subject who enters the screening period will receive a unique subject identification number
at the time of consent [refer to the Investigational Product Manual (IPM)]. This number will be 
used to identify  the subject throughout the study  and must be used on all study  documentation 
related to the subject.
Furthermore, the subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire 
clinical study , it must not be changed after enrollment or if the subject is rescreened or r etreated
(see Section 7.11.10 for details regarding retreatment ).
Once a subject commences leukapheresis, the subject will be considered enrolled i nto the study .

6_ PROTOCOL TREATMENT 
6.1. Treatment Terminology 
The following te1ms will be used to describe and define protoco l treatment: 
• Bridging chem otherapy refers to treatment used to control a subject's disease prior to 
conditioning chemo therapy. 
• CSF prophylaxis will be admini stered prior to infusion of conditioning chem otherapy . 
• The Conditioning chem otherapy regimen used for this study will be fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide. 
• The investigational p roduct for this study is named KTE- X19. 
6.2. Leukapheresis (within approximately 5 days of eligibility confirmation) 
Before leukapher esis commences, the criteria out lined in Section 7 .11. 3 must be m et. 
Subjects will undergo leukapher esis to obtain leukocytes (white blood cells) for the manu facture 
of KTE- X19. Leukapheresed cells obtained from subj ects at paiiicipating centers will be 
shipped to th e Cell Process ing Facility (CPF) overnight as described in the 1PM. 
The leukapheresed cells ai· e then 
packaged for expe dited shipment to the C PF as described in the 1PM. 
See Section 6.8 for excluded medications prior to leukapheresis. 
6.3. Bridging Chemotherap y 
Bridging therap y may be admini stered after leukapheresis and prior to conditioning 
chemotherap y at the investigators discretion. Bridging chemo therapy is recollllllended for all 
subjects paii icul ai·ly those subjects with high di sease burden at baseline [M3 maITow (>25% 
leukemic blasts) or 1000 blasts/mm3 in the peripheral circulation]. If prescribed, bridging 
chemo therapy must be admini stered after leukapheresis and completed at least 7 days or 5 ha lf-
lives, whichever is sho1ier, prior to initiating conditioning chem otherapy .

a Use of a TKI in combina tion with any of the ab ove regimens is allowed for subjec ts with Ph+ ALL and Ph-like ALL 
6.4. CSF Prophylaxi s 
All subjects will receive CSF prophylaxis consisting of an intrathecal regime n according to 
institutio nal or national guidelines (eg, methoti·exate 12 to 15 mg, cytosine arabinoside 40 mg, or 
dexamethasone 4 mg or equivalent steroid dose). 
CSF prophylaxi s will be admin istered any time durin g screening ( eg, at time of screening lumbar 
punct ure) through 7 days prior to KTE-X19 infu sion. 
Subjects who are emolled with CNS -2 disease at baseline must receive CSF prophylax is after 
leukaphe resis and at least 7 days prior to KTE- X19 infusion, unless othe1 w i se approved by the 
Kite Medical Monitor. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 of 100 31 October 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 33of 100 31October 2018Multiple doses of CSF prophy laxis can be given per investigator discretion in accordance with 
institutional guidelines, but at least 7 day s must pass between the last dose of CSF proph ylaxis 
and KTE- X19 infusion.  
Additional CSF prophy laxis may  be given post -KTE -X19 infusion per investigator discretion in 
accordance with institutional guidelines, but should be avoided for at least 8 weeks after 
KTE- X19 infusion if possible.  
Should a subject have an Ommay a reservoir and there is no evidence of blockage of CSF flow 
from the spinal canal, administration of CSF prophy laxis through the reservoir is acceptable. 
6.5. Conditioning Chemotherapy
Conditioning chemotherapy refers to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide used for 
lymphodepletion prior to administration of KTE -X19.  Subjects will receive conditioning 
chemotherapy from Day - 4 through day -2.  
Conditioning chemotherapy will be supplied by the investigative site unless otherwise 
noted.
Refer to the current product label for guidance on packaging, storage, preparation, 
administration and toxicity management associated with the administration of 
chemotherapy agents.
The investigational medicinal product (KTE -X19) must be available before initiation of 
conditioning chemotherapy.
See Sec tion 7.11.6.1 for conditioning chemotherapy procedures. 
6.5.1. Fludarabine
Fludarabine phosphate is a sy nthetic purine nucleoside that differs from phy siologic nucleosides 
in that the sugar moiety  is arabinose instead of ribose or deoxy ribose.  Fludarabine is a purine 
antagonist antimetabolite.
6.5.2. Cyclophosphamide
Cyclophosphamide is a nitroge n mustard -derivative alky lating agent.  Following conversion to 
active metabolites in the liver, cy clophosphamide functions as an alk ylating agent; the drug also 
possesses potent immunosuppressive activit y.  The serum half -life after IV administration rang es 
from 3-12 hours; the drug and/or its metabolites can be detected in the serum for up to 72 hours 
after administration.  
6.5.3. Mesna
Mesna is a detoxify ing agent used to inhibit the hemorrhagic cy stitis induced by  chemotherapy .  
The active ingredient in mesna
is a s ynthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium-2-
mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C 2H5NaO 3S2.  Mesna will be administered 
around the cy clophosphamide dose according to institutional standards.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 34of 100 31October 20186.5.4. Rationale for Conditioning Chem otherapy Choice and Dose
The rationale for the conditioning chemotherap y regimen and dose selection is based on the 
Phase 1 study  conducted at the Pediatric Oncology Branch at the NCI (Lee et al, 2015 ).In this 
study , 21 subjects (20 with ALL) were treated and all received the same fluda rabine and 
cyclophosphamide schedule with a favorable benefit/risk profile. 
Consistent with the NCI  protocol (Lee et al, 2015 ), the KTE-X19- 103 study will use the same 
Conditioning chemotherapy  regimen consisting of fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m2/day IV over 
30 minutes on Day -4, Day  - 3, Day  -2 prior to KTE -X19 and cy clophosphamide at a dose of 
900mg/m2/day 
IV over 60 minutes on Day  -2 prior to KTE -X19. Day -1 will be a rest day .  The 
3-day conditioning chemotherap y regimen may be administered in an outpatient setting in 
accordance with the daily  dosing instructions outline din Section 7.11.6.2. 
Following completion of each subjects’ conditioning chemotherap y regimen, subjects will 
receive their respective KTE
-X19 infusion.  
6.6. KTE -X19
The IP for this study is KTE -X19.
Refer to the most current Investigator’s Brochure regarding KTE -X19 and clinical 
experience.   This section contains general information and is not intended to provide specific 
instructions.  Refer to the IPMfor details and instruction on storage and administration of 
KTE
-X19.  
KTE- X19 is supplied cr yopreserved in cry ostorage bags.   
  The cryostorage bags containing KTE -X19 arrive frozen in 
a liquid nitrogen dry  shipper.  The bags must be stored in vapor phase of liquid nitrogen and the 
product remains frozen until the subject is read y for treatment to assure viable live autologous 
cells are administered to the subject . Several inactive ingredients are added to the product to 
assure viability  and sta bility  of the live cells through the freezing, thawing, and infusion process.
KTE- X19 is a subject -specific product and the intended subject will be identified by  a unique 
subject ID number.  Upon receipt, verification that the product and subject -specific labels match 
the 
subject ’sinformation (eg, initials, subject ID number) is essential.  Do not infuse the product 
if the information on the subject- specific label does not match the intended subject.  The volume 
of 
KTE- X19 infused, the thaw start/stop time, and KTE- X19 infusion start /stop time, will be 
noted in the subject medical record. The product must not be thawed until the subject is ready  
for the infusion.  
To date , subjects have received doses of anti- CD19 CAR T cells ranging from 0.5 - 30 x 106
anti-CD19 
CAR T cells/kg.  There have been no instances of accidental overdose of subjects in 
this program.  In case of accidental overdose, treatment should be supportive.   Corticos teroid 
therap y ma y be considered if an y dose is associated with severe toxicity (see Section 6.8 for 
more information related to corticosteroid use).

6.6.1. Rationale for KTE-X19 Dose 
In the ZUMA -3 study , the initial 6 subjects were ti·eated at 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CART cell/kg , 
with a su bseq uent group of 14 subjects ti·eated at 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CART cell/kg . No DLTs 
were obse rved in the DLT evaluable set, no drop off was seen in efficacy betwee n the 2 x 106 
anti-CD19 CART cell/kg and 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cell/kg KTE-X19 doses and there was 
no clear diffe rence in the safe rofile Section 2.8· Shah et al 2016 
CAR T ce Wkg was considered the recommended Phase 2 dose. 
For subjects weig hing greate r than 100 kg, a maximum flat dose of 2 x 108 or 1 x 108 or 0.5 x 108 
anti-CD19 CART cells ma be admin istered. See Sections 9.6 for d etails.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 of 100 31 October 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 36of 100 31October 2018Investigators may  additionally  prescribe any  other concomitant medications or treatment deemed 
necessary  to provide adequate supportive care, including growth factor support (eg, G -CSF) and 
routine anti -emetic prophy laxis and treatment except those medications listed in the excluded 
medication Section 6.8.  
In subjects with Ph+disease and who achieve CR
, a TKI may  be resumed 2months after 
KTE
-X19 infusion at the investigator discretion and in accordance with institutional guidelines . 
See Section 3, Table 2for use of TKI’s during bridging chemotherap y.

6.8. Excluded Medications
Corticosteroid therap y at a pharmacologic dose (> 5 mg/day  of prednisone or equivalent doses of 
other corticosteroids) and other immunosuppressive drugs must be avoided for7 day s prior to 
leukapheresis and 5 day s prior to KTE- X19 infusion .  
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-103  Amendment 6 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 37of 100 31October 2018Systemic cort icosteroids should be avoided as premedication insubjects for whom CT scans 
with contrast are contraindicated (ie, subjects with contrast allergy  or impaired renal clearance).  
If possible, such subjects should undergo non -contrast CT scans or alternative imagine modality  
(such as MRI) instead. 
Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs should also be avoided for 3 months after 
KTE
-X19 infusion, unless used to manage KTE -X19 related toxicities ( Refer to the most 
current version of the IB; see Section 6.4).  Other medications which may  interfere with 
evaluation of KTE -X19, such as non -steroidal anti -inflammatory  agents should also be avoided 
for the same time period unless medically  necessary .  
Therapeutic doses of s ystemic anticoagulants, such as unfractionated heparin and low -molecular 
weight heparin, should be avoided anytimesubjects are at risk of bleeding due to 
thrombocy topenia when possible.  I f a subject requires the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulant 
doses prior to initiation of conditioning chemotherapy  or prior to KTE -X19 infusion, then 
conditioning chemotherapy /KTE- X19 infusion must be held and the case discussed with the Kite 
Medical Monitor.
Forsubjects with Ph+ALL, all TKIs must be stopped at least 1 week prior to KTE- X19 infusion, 
including but not limited to imatinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib.  I n subjects who achieve CR, a 
TKI may be resumed 2months after KTE -X19 infusion. See Section 6.3, Table 2for use of 
TKIs during bridging chemotherap y.
CSF prophy laxis may  be given post -KTE -X19 infusion per investigator discretion in accordance 
with institutional guidelines, but should be avoided for at least 8 weeks after KTE
-X19 infusion 
if possible.  
Treatment for the subject’s leukemia such as chemotherap y, immunotherapy, targeted agents, 
radiation, high dose corticosteroid, other than defined/allowed in this protocol, and other 
investigational agents are prohibited except as needed for treatment of dis ease progression after
KTE- X19 infusion. If permissibility  of a specific medication/treatment is in question, contact 
the Kite Pharma medical monitor.
Medications with sedative properties should be avoided if possible in the setting of neurologic 
events (refer to the KTE- X19 IB).
6.9. Subsequent Therapy 
Subsequent therap y administered after KTE- X19 infusion for a subject s’disease such as non-
study  specified chemotherap y, immunotherapy, targeted agents ,as well as stem cell transplant 
and radiation therap y will be recorded for all enrolled subjects until one of the following 
occur:   subject completes the long term follow up period, is considered lost to follow up, 
withdraws consent, or dies .  
For subjects who are enrolled, but do not receive KTE

Research staff should refer to the SOA for an outline of the procedures required. The visit 
schedule is calculated from KTE- X19 infusion on Day  0. 
An overview of study  assessments/procedures is outlined below. A description for each period
of the study  is provided in Section 7.11. Refer to the CRF completion guidelines for data 
collection requirements and documentation of study procedures.
7.1. Informed Consent
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study , the investigator is responsible for obtaining 
written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the study  design, 
anticipated benefits and the potential risks. Subjects should sign the most c urrent Institutional 
Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC )approved Informed Consent form 
(ICF)prior to any  study  specific activity  or procedure is performed.
Theconsent process and the subject’s agreement or refusal to participate in the study  is to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records. If the subject agrees to participate ,the ICF is to be 
signed and personally  dated by  the subject and by  the person who conducted the informe d 
consent discussion. The original signed ICF will be retained in accordance with institution 
policy  and IRB/IEC requirements with a cop y of the I CF provided to the subject.
All subjects who are enrolled into the study  should be re -consented with any upda ted version of 
the IRB/IEC approved ICF if relevant to their participation in the study .
7.2. Demographic Data
Demographic data will be collected per country and local regulations and guidelines.  Where 
applicable, demographic data will include sex,year of bir th, race, ethnicity and country  of 
enrollment to study  their possible association with subject saf ety and treatment effectiveness .
7.3. Medical and Treatment History
Relevant medical history prior to the start of adverse event reporting will be collected. Relevant 
medical history  is defined as data on the subject’s concurrent medical condition that would be 
typicall y share din a referral let ter. All findings will be recorded in the CRF s.
In addition to the medical history , all history  related to the subject’s disease, treatment and 
response to treatment will be collected and must date back to the original diagnosis.
For subjects who are being referred from another clinic or institution to the participating research 
center, copies from the subject ’s chart shoul dbe obtained.

Life-5 Dimensions (EQ -5D)
Physical exam
s will be performed during screening and a t times noted . Changes 
noted in subsequent exams when compared to the baseli ne exam will be reported as an adverse 
event. 
During KTE
-X19 infusion /hospitalization, vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, 
oxygen saturation, and temperature will be monitored before and after the KTE- X19 infusion and 
then routinely  (every  4-6 hours) while hospitalized . If the subject has a fever (temperature
38.3oCor greater ) at any  time during hospitalization, vital signs will be monitored more 
frequentl y as clinically indicated.
Performance status 
as measured b y the ECOG scale will be performed to qu antify  the subject’s 
general well -being and ability  to perform 
activities of daily  life.
The EQ -5D will be completed only  for subjects participating in phase 2.  The EQ -5D will be 
completed at the timepoints outlined in the SOA prior to other study  related procedures or 
assessments .  Subjects who are blind or illiterate may  have the EQ- 5D questions read to them by  
the study  staff.  The study staff, however, cannot interpret any  of the questions for the subject.  A 
subject may be exempt from completing the questionnaire if he or she is unable to read the 
questionnaire in one of the country  languages available.
The EQ -5D is a 2 page generic patient questionnaire for assessing the overall health status of a 
subject.  The EQ -5D consists of a 5 dimension descriptive sy stem including questions on 
mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/comfort, and anxiety /depression and a visual analogue 
scale (EQ VAS) which allows the respondent to record health on a vertical scale (eg ,best health 
to worst health) thus allowing a quantitative measure of health outcome.   
7.5. Neuro logical Assessment 
Subject’s neurological status should be evaluated at screening to establish a base line.  After 
enrollment, subjects should be evaluated for an y neu rological s ymptoms at each of the 
timepoints specified in the SOA.  During the hospitalization period, evaluations of neurological 
status may  need to be increased.   Changes in neurological status should be reported as an adverse 
event per Section 9.
7.6. Cardiac Function 
Each subject’s cardiac function as measured b y ECHO will be assessed during the screening 
period to confirm stud y eligibility . No evidence of pericardial effusion, as required b y 
eligibility ,
will also be confirmed by  ECHO.  
If the last chemotherap y regimen the subject received is not considered cardiotoxic , then an 
ECHO performed within 28 day s prior to signing the consent may be used for eligibility .

7.9.1. Bone Marrow Evaluation
Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies will be collected thr oughout the stud y
  
Screening bone marrow evaluation:
If available, archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) bone marrow block 
and/or slides used for the original diagnosis of ALL will be submitted to the central 
laboratory  along with the pathology  report.
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy  is required at screening and will be performed after 
the last dose of s ystemic chemotherap y and within approximately  14 day s before 
enrollment to establish baseline disease.   
■If there is a delay  between when the screening bone marrow is performed and the 
apheresis, contact the Kite Medical Monitor for guidance on whether or not bone 
marrow evaluation n
eeds to be repeated.   If a fresh bone marrow aspirate and biopsy  
was recentl y collected and properl y stored prior to consent, then contact the Kite 
Medical Monitor to confirm if this sample is adequate for screening.   
In subjects who receive bridging chemotherap y, an additional bone marrow sample is 
required between the end of bridging chemotherapy  and Day -4.  If bridging 
chemotherap y is not administered, then the 
additional bone marrow sample is not 
required , however, an assessment of peripheral circulat ing blasts is required (see 
Section 7.11.6.3 regarding requirement for peripheral blast count ).  
On study  bone marrow evaluations: 
A bone marrow aspirate will be required at all time points 
 to assess 
treatment response.  
■For subjects who undergo a SCT, bone marrow evaluations are not required during 
the first 100 day s post -SCT.  After 100 day s, bone marrow evaluations should be 
performed at the next per protocol time point per the SOA.  If a subject has a bone 
marrow evaluation earlier than the next per protocol time point, then the bone marrow 
samples should be processed and submitted to the central laboratory  per the central

performed if standard of care .  Note: Anytime the bone marrow aspirate is a dry  tap, then 
a bone marrow biops y is required.   In the case of a dry  tap, the bone marrow biopsy  will 
be used to determine disease burden by immunohistochemical (IHC) anal yses.  The 
following markers will be anal yzed by IHC: CD10, CD19, CD20, CD34, Pax5 and TdT. 
For subjects who sign the optional portion of the consent form, a Day 7bone marrow 
biopsy  and aspirate will be performed.   The optional day  7 bone marrow may  be 
performed between day  7 and 14.
Reminder
s: 
■For subjects with a CR, collection and anal ysis of CSF is required to confirm CR (see 
Section 7.7)
■For subjects with PD, a PBMC sample should be collected at time of progression and 
prior to starting subsequent anticancer therap y 
Locally  evaluated % blasts from the bone marrow evaluation and if available local MRD will be 
entered to the CRF.
Overall response will be assessed b y the investigator per Appendix 1.  If bone marrow blasts are 
≤ 5% and circulating blasts are ≥ 1%, then additional studies (
eg, flow cy tometry ) should be 
performed to quantify  the blasts.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy samples will be processed and submitted to the central 
laboratory  as outlined in the central laboratory  manual.   Refer to the laboratory  manual for 
collection, processing and shipment requirements ; note some samples, eg, MRD, must be 
shipped on the same day  of collection .  Below is a noverview of the sample ty pes that will be 
required.
Samples from bone marrow aspirate may include:
MRD assessment
Stained slide smears
The same slides used to evaluate ALL disease status (eg, % blasts) locally  will be 
submitted to the central laboratory  and will then be returned back to the investigative site 
after the review is completed.  If the same slides used to diagnose ALL cannot be 
submitted to the central laboratory  per institutional policy , then slides from the same 
procedure should be submitted.  See central la boratory  manual for details.

archival and on -study  bone marrow samples. 
7.9.2. Imaging Requirements (Only Applies to Subjects with Known Non -CNS 
Extramedullary Disease at Baseline)
Extramedull ary disease will be assessed prior to baseline with an imaging modality  
appropriate for the anatomical site and clinical scenario (eg, MRI for CNS lesion, ultrasound 
for testicular lesion, CT for intra- abdominal or thoracic lesion).  
For all subjects with known non -CNS extramedullary  disease, images must b e taken 
within 28 day s before conditioning chemotherap y.  In addition, for subjects receiving 
bridging chemotherap y, images must be taken after bridging chemotherap y has 
completed. 
Following KTE -X19 infusion , the first on study  images will occur at the ti me of first 
presumed response (ie, bone marrow blasts ≤ 5%)
Subsequent images will continue as per the SOA through Month 24 or disease progression, 
whichever occurs first.  If the subject’s disease has not progressed b y Month 24, then images 
will be perfor med per standard of care until disease progression.
All on -study  assessments of extramedullary  disease detected through imaging should be 
made with the same imaging modality  and of the same anatomical locations as imaged at 
baseline.  
Response is evaluate d by the investigator ( Appendix 1).  
For all subjects, images should be performed per standard of care 
anytime the s ubject
presents with sy mptoms suggestive of disease progression  
 
Images will be submitted to a central imaging vendor ; central imaging vendor manual to be

screening period will be allowed to rescreen. Subjects will retain the same subject 
indentifcation number assigned at the original screening.  If re screening occurs within 
28days of the signing of the original informed consent, the assessment or procedure that 
initially  resulted in the subject failing screening will be performed, including an y other 
procedures that fell outside of the designated scre ening window (ie ,lab assessments ); all other 
initial screening procedures/assessments do not need to be repeated.
7.11.3. Enrollment /Leukaph eresis
Before leukapheresis commences, the following criteria must be met:
In general, all eligibility  criteria confirmed d uring screening must not be known to be 
violated prior to leukapheresis.  Additionally , the investigator must review and confirm that 
the last CBC with differential and chemistry  panel drawn prior to the start of leukapheresis 
must meet the eligibility  criteria detailed in Inclusion criterion 105.  If any  screening 
assessments or procedures are repeated between screening and the start of leukapheresis and 
results are outside the eligibility  criteria ( Section 5), contact the Kite medical monitor before 
proceeding with leukapheresis.  
Subjects must have no evidence of clinically  significant infection prior to leukapheresis.  
Should a subject have cl inically  significant infection immediately  prior to leukapheresis, cell

Administration of KTE -X19 cells to subjects with ongoing infection or inflammation, even 
if such processes are asymptomatic, increases the risk of high grade and fatal toxicity.  All 
efforts should be made to rule out such conditions prior to cell infusion .  
Signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory results attributed to the malignancy ( elevated 
C-reactive protein [CRP]) are diagnoses of exclusion that require a documented workup to 
establish.  Conditioning chemotherapy and KTE- X19 infusion should only be ini tiated after 
it is reasonably assured that cell infusion can safely proceed.  
The investigational medicinal product (KTE -X19) must be available before initiation of 
conditioning chemotherapy.
Refer to Section 7.11.7.5 for Requirements to Work -up Potential Infectious and/or 
Inflammatory States.
7.11.6.1. Conditioning Chemotherapy Period
7.11.6.1.1. Requirements for Initiating Conditioning Chemotherapy      
If any of the f ollowing criteria are met prior to the initiation of conditioning chemotherapy, 
then the work -up listed in Section 7.11.7.5 must be performed to determine the potential 
cause if there is no identified source of infection.
Temperature > 38ºC within 72 hours before conditioning chemotherapy
CRP > 100 mg/L  any time between enrolment to start of conditioning chemotherapy
WBC count or WBC differential concerning for infectious process between enrollment to 
start of conditioning chemotherap y (eg, WBC > 20,000, rapidly increasing WBC, or 
differential with high percentage of segments/bands)
Additionally, 
If any screening assessments or procedures are repeated between confirmation of 
eligibility and the start of conditioning chemotherapy and results are outside the 
eligibility criteria listed in Section 5, then the condition must resolve prior to proceeding 
with conditioning chemotherapy.
Complete history and physical exam including HEENT, cardiac, vascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, integumentary, and neurological systems mu st not reveal evidence of 
infection/inflammation.
The subject must not have received systemic anti -
microbials for the treatment of a 
known or suspected infection within 48 hours before conditioning chemotherapy 
(prophylactic use of anti -microbials is allowed).

• Treatment course of any antimicrobials given for known or suspected antecedent 
infection should be complete as per infectiou s disease consult (if applicable) 
recommendation before stopping or switching to proph ylactic antimicrobial s. 
• If a subject is confirmed to have an infectiou s proces s for which antimicrobial s are not 
available (eg, viral pneumonia) , the infection must be clinicall y resolved as determined 
by the investigator in consultation with infectiou s disease service (if applicable ) 
• Most recentl y collected blood , urine, or other body fluid cultures must show no growth 
for at least 48 hour s, and any other infectiou s workup performed ( eg, bacterial, viral 
serologie s, PCR , stool studie s, imaging studie s) must be negative. If clinical suspicion is 
for an infection for which culture s are unlikel y to be positive within 48 hours ( eg, fungal 
infection) , adequate time must be allowed for cultures to become positive.

-Chemistiy Panel 
-CBC with diffe renti al 
Note: If subject did not have bridging therapy and hence bone manow is not 
collected betwee n the end of bridg ing chemot herapy and staii of Conditioning 
chemotherapy , then sites must assess perip heral blasts counts during this time period 
(eg, at Day -4). 
- Bl ood draw for PBMCs and cytokine levels 
• Bone manow evaluation (see Section 7.9.1 ) 
-In subjects who r eceive bridging chemot herapy, an addit ional bone manow sample is 
required between the end of bridging chemotherapy and Day -4. If bridging 
chemotherapy is not administered , then the additional bone manow sample is not 
required.

7.11.7. Investigational Product Treatment Period
7.11.7.1. Pre-KTE -X19 Infusion Criteria
If any of the following criteria are met prior to the initiation of KTE -X19, then the work -up 
listed in Section 7.11.7.5 must be performed to determine the potential cause if there is no 
identified source of infection.  
Temperature > 38°C within 72 hours of KTE -X19 infusion
CRP > 100 mg/L any time between en rollment to start of KTE -X19 infusion
WBC count or WBC differential concerning for infectious process between enrollment 
to start of KTE -X19infusion (eg, WBC > 20,000, rapidly increasing WBC, or 
differential with high percentage of segments/bands)
Addition ally:
All eligibility criteria of the protocol must be met.  If any screening assessments or 
procedures are repeated between confirmation of eligibility and the start of KTE -X19 
infusion and results are outside the eligibility criteria liste
d in Section 5, then the 
condition must resolve prior to proceeding with KTE
-X19 infusion (except for 
peripheral blood cell counts that have been impacted by conditioning chemotherapy).
Complete history and physical exam including HEENT, and cardiac, vascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, integumentary, and neurological systems must not reveal 
evidence of infection/inflammation.
The subject must not have rec eived systemic anti -microbials for the treatment of a 
known or suspected infection within 48 hours before KTE -X19 (prophylactic use of 
anti-microbials is allowed).  
Treatment course of any antimicrobials given for known or suspected antecedent 
infection s hould be complete as per infectious disease consult (if applicable) 
recommendation before stopping or switching to prophylactic antimicrobials.  
If a subject is confirmed to have an infectious process for which antimicrobials are not 
available (eg, viral pneumonia), the infection must be clinically resolved as determined 
by the investigator in consultation with infectious disease service (if applicable).
Most recently collected blood, urine, or other body fluid cultures must show no growth 
for at least 48 hours, and any other infectious workup performed (eg, bacterial, viral 
serologies, PCR, stool studies, imaging studies) must be negative.  If clinical suspicion is 
for an infection for which cultures are unlikely to be positive within 48 hours (eg, fungal 
infection), adequate time must be allowed for cultures to become positive.

Protocol KTE -C19-103  Amendment 6 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 56of 100 31October 2018Once the above criteria are met, then the subject can proceed with administration of 
KTE -X19.
If the KTE- X19 infusion is delayed > 2 weeks, protocol guidelines should be followed 
regarding the need for repeat conditioning chemotherapy. 
7.11.7.2. Hospitalization for KTE- X19 Infusion
Subjects will be hospitalized to receive infusion of KTE- X19 followed b y a minimum 7 day
observation period unless otherwise required by country regulatory agencie s (refer to 
Appendix 3for details).
Subjects will remain in the hospital through da y 7 post infusion of KTE- X19.  Subjects should 
not be discharged from the hospital until all KTE
-X19-related non- hematological to xicities 
return to grade ≤ 1 or return to baseline. Subjects may  be discharged with non -critical and 
clinically  stable or slowly  improving toxicities (eg, renal insufficiency ) even if > grade 1, if 
deemed appropriate by the investigator. Subjects should remain hospitalized for ongoing
KTE-X19- related fever, hy potension, hy poxia, or ongoing central neurological toxicity  
>grade 1, or if deemed necessary  by the treating investigator.
Given the possibility  that a subject could develop CRS or neurologic events in the outpatient 
setting after discharge, subjects and their family  members/caregivers should be educated on 
potential sy mptoms of these s yndromes such as fever, d yspnea, confusion, aphasia, dy sphasia, 
somnolence, encephalopathy , ataxia, or tremor. If subjects develop these symptoms, they should 
be instructed to immediately  contact the principal investigator or seek immediate medical 
attention. 
See Section 6.8for excluded medications prior to and after KTE- X19.
7.11.7.3. KTE- X19 Premedication Dosing
The following pre -KTE- X19 infusion medications should be administered approximately  1 hour 
prior to infusion.  Alternatives to the recommendations below should be discussed with the 
Kite medical monitor
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO or equivalent
Diphenhy dramine 12.5 mg administered either orally  or via IV or equivalent
7.11.7.4. KTE
-X19 Infusion (Day  0)
Central venous access, such as a port or a peripherally  inserted central catheter, is required for 
the administration of KTE -X19.  Catheter care, per institutional guidelines, should be followed.  
Materials and instructions for the thawing, timing, and administering of KTE -X19 are outlined in 
the IPM.  It is recommended that vital signs are recorded before KTE- X19 infusion and then 
routinely as clinically  indicated (eg, fever ≥38.3°C). 
The I PM must be reviewed prior to administration of KTE- X19.

Protocol KTE -C19-103  Amendment 6 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 57of 100 31October 2018Research sites should follow institutional guidelines for the infusion of cell products.
During this period, the following procedures will be completed at the time points outlined in the 
SOA:
Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oxy gen saturation, and temperature every
Q4-6 hours during hospitalization (see Section 7.4 for vital sign requirements during the 
initial hospitalization)
ECOG performance status
EQ-5D (Phase 2 subjects only ; see Section 7.4)
Neurological assessment (see Section 7.5)
Labs (before KTE -X19 infusion) (see Section 7.8)
Chemistry  Panel
CBC with differential
Blood draw for PBMCs and cy tokine levels (See SOA for frequency )
Recommended:  Monitoring of CRP, ferritin, and LDH (onl y if LDH is elevated at 
baseline ) levels may  assist with the diagnosis and define the clinical course in regards to 
CRS/ neurologic events .  It is, therefore, recommended that CRP, ferritin, and L DH (if 
elevated at baseline) be monitored daily  starting at Day  0 and continuing through 
hosp
italization. I n addition, lactate should be monitored as clinicall y indicated.   
Lumbar puncture for subjects with first onset grade ≥ 2 neurologic s ymptoms should be 
completed for examination of CSF (see Section 7.7)
As applicable, an additional cy tokine sample should be drawn at the first onset and first 
reoccurrence of an y ≥grade 2 CRS (per Lee 2014 criteria; Table 15) if not alread y collected 
on that day   
Bone marrow evaluation (see Section 
7.9)
For subjects who sign the option alconsent form, an additional bone marrow 
biopsy /aspirate wil l be collected day  7 post KTE- X19 infusion.  If sample cannot be 
collected on day 7, then sample can be collected between day  7 – 14. 
KTE
-X19 pre-medications (see Section 7.11.7.3)
Infusion of

Prior to KTE -X19 Infusion
In the absence of an identified source of infection (eg, line infection, pneumonia on chest 
x-ray), the minimum workup to be performed prior to administration of conditioning 
chemotherapy and/or KTE- X19 consist s of:
Call Kite medical monitor
Infectious disease service consult (if applicable)
CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast.  If there is a medical 
contraindication to contrast, then non -contrast CT is allowed.  
The following must be performed (prior to the initiation of anti -microbials if clinically 
feasible): 
Blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic x2 bottles each) and UA and urine culture.   
Deep/induced sputum culture if clinically indicated.
All indwelling lines, such as central ve nous catheters, should be examined for any 
signs of infection, and additional cultures should be drawn from the line.
Nasopharyngeal -throat (NPT) swab or equivalent assay for viral infection such as 
influenza A/B (including H1N1), parainfluenza 1/2/3, aden ovirus, respiratory 
syncytial virus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus
Collection of fungal cultures and markers as appropriate (eg, galactomannan, 
fungitell)
Collection of appropriate serum viral studies (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV])
If a central nervous system process is suspected, appropriate brain imaging and 
subsequent lumbar puncture with cytology, culture, Gram stain, and viral PCR should 
be performed.  
Any additional sign or symptom- directed investigation should be performed as 
clinically indicated.
Prior to proceeding with conditioning chemotherapy and/or KTE- X19 infusion, the above 
workup must not suggest the presence of an active infection, and all requirements for 
conditioning chemotherapy and/or KTE -X19 infusion must be satisfied.  If the KTE -X19 
infusion is delayed > 2 weeks following conditioning chemotherapy, protocol guidelines 
should be followed regarding the need for repeat conditioning chemotherapy. 
If the above workup was triggered due to CRP > 100 mg/L, CRP should be repeated, 
and if CRP cont inues to increase significantly, evaluation should be performed for any 
other potential infectious or inflammatory condition not previously evaluated.

• Su bject must not h ave had a grade~ 2 KTE-X19 -related imm ediate h ypersensitivity reaction 
• CD19 tumor expression in bone maiTow or peripheral blood must be documented after 
progressio n. If CD 19 expressio n is quantified, then there must be 90% CD 19 p ositive 
blasts. 
• Su bject did not expe rience grade 4 CRS, grade 4 neurologic events, or any grade of edema in 
the b rain with the first KTE- X19 infusion 
• Any CRS and neurologic events have fully resolved prior to th e retreatment 
• Any toxicity related to fludai·abine or cyclophosphami de should be resolved to ::; grade 1 or 
return to baseline, prior to re treatment, with the exce ption of clinically insignifi cant toxicities 
(eg, alop ecia). 
• The subject has not r eceived subsequent therapy for the treatment of leukemia 
• The subject does not h ave known anti-KTE- X19 antibodies 
• In consultation w ith the Kite Med ical Mo nitor there is agreement to give the additional 
KTE-X19 infusion 
If the rate of grade ~ 2 KTE- X19-related imm ediate hyperse nsitivi ty reaction to reinfusion of 
KTE-X19 is > 33% after a minimum of 6 subj ects, then no a dditional s ubjects will be pennitted 
to receive an additional dose ofKTE-X19. Incidences of grade~ 2 KTE- X19-related imm ediate 
hypersensitivi ty reaction w ill be mo nitored each time a subject is retreated. In the cases when 
2 or more s ubjects with grade ~ 2 KTE- X19-related imm ediate h ypersensitivi ty reaction have 
been observed before the subject is retrea ted, then no additional su bjects will be permitt ed to 
receive an additional dose of KTE- X19. 
A discussion r egarding bene fits and risks of any add itional K TE-X19 dose , including the 
potential need to undergo leukapheresis a second time for the manufac turin g ofKTE-X19, 
should occur with the s ubject prior to perfonnin g any study related proced ures or treatment. 
This conversation sho uld also be recorded in the subj ect's source document. 
Allowance for additional d oses is based on clinical expe rience reported in studies conducted at 
the pediatric (Lee et al, 2015 ) and S urge1 y Branch (K ochenderfer et al 2015 of the NCI where

1 Vital signs: Includes blood pressure , heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature . Height will be collected at screening. Vitals will be monitored before and after the KTE-X19 
infusion and then routinel y (every 4-6 hours) while hospitaliz ed. If the subjec t has a fever (temperature 38.3oC or greater) at any time during hospitalization , vital signs will be 
monitored more frequently as clinically indicated. 
2 Bone M arrow Evaluation (biopsy and aspirate) for Disease Assess ment (Section 7.9): For screening bone marrow evaluat ion see sectio n 7.9. 1. A bone marrow aspirate will be 
required at all timepoints per the SOA table above (Subj ects that recei ve an SCT, bone m arrow evaluati ons are not required for the first 100 days post SCT). In addition to the 
bone marrow aspirate , a bone marrow biopsy is required at Screening , Day -4 and Day 28. The Day -4 bone marrow biopsy is only required for subjects receiving bridging 
chemotherapy . A bone marrow biopsy at all other timepoints is recommended and should be performed if standard of care. Anytime the bone marrow aspirate is a dry tap, then a bone 
marrow biopsy is required . Disease status will be evaluated per institutional pract ices. A portion of the aspirate collected will be submitted to the central lab on the day of collection 
and analyzed for MRD; see the central laboratory manual for details. The optional day 7 bone marrow biopsy and aspirate may be performed between day 7 and 14. Overall response 
will be assessed by the invest igator per Append ix 1. If bone marrow blasts are~ S% and circulating blasts are,:: 1 %, then additional studies (eg, flow cytometry) should be performed 
to quantify the blasts . 
3 Extra medullary Imagi ng (Section 7.9.2 ): For subjects with known baseline extramedullary disease detected through imaging , baseline images appropriate for the anatomical location 
and clinical scenario will be performed. For subjects receiving bridging cliemotherapy , images will be performed after bridging chemotherapy and before conditioning chemotherapy. 
For subjects not receiving bridging chemotherapy , images will be performed within 28 days before conditioning cliemotherapy. On study images will be performed with the same

7 imaging modality and anatomica l location as imaged at baseline . Following KTE-X19 infusion , the first on study images will occur at the first occurrence of leukemia remission based 
on the bone marr ow evaluation . Subsequent images will continue as per the SOA through Month 24 or disease progression, whichever occurs first. If the subject 's disease has not 
progressed by Month 24, then images will be performed per standard of care until disease progression. For subjects with or without extramedullary disease , images should be performed 
per standard of care anytime the subject presents with symptoms suggestive of disease progression. 
Lumb ar Puncture (Section 7. 7): CSF samples will be analyzed locally for disease assessment and centrally for disease assessment and toxic ity evaluation at the following timepoints : 
1) Baseline - a CSF result obtained within 30 days before enrollment will be acceptable eligibility determination, 2) at the time ofCSF prophylaxis, 3) for subjects with baseline CNS-2 
disease , a CSF sample is required at the time of first presumed response based on bone marrow (bone marrow <5%), 4) first onse t of grade 2 or greater neurological symptoms or as 
medically indicated S) for subj ects with a CR, collection and analysis of CSF is required to confir m CR and 6) per institutional standard of care. Should a subject have an Ommaya 
reservoir and there is no evidence of blockage of CSF flow from the spinal canal, withdrawal of the CSF sample though the reservoir is acceptable . CSF samples (ie, collected on or 
after informed consent) will be submitted to the central laboratory. 
Leukapheresis (Sections 6.2 and 7.11.3) : All leukapheresis criteria must be met before leukapheresis commences . Vitals, weight, and laboratory sample draws may be 
da of 01· before leuka heresis , exc t wei t must be collected on da of leuka heresis . All laborato sam les should be drawn before the leuka heresis rocedure . 
(Section 6.3) will be administered after leukaphe resis and completed at least 7 days or 5 half-lives , whichever is shorter , prior to initiating 
con tiorung c emo erapy . CSF prophylaxis (Section 6.4) will be administered any time during screening through 7 days before the KTE-X19 infusion. Subjects who are enrolled 
with CNS-2 disease at baseline must receive CSF prophylaxis after leukapheresis and at least 7 days prior to KTE-X19 , unless otherwise approved by the Kite Medical Monitor . 
Multiple doses of CSF prophylaxis can be given per investigator discretion in accordance with institutional guidelines, but at least 7 days must pass between the last dose of CSF 
prophylaxis and KTE-X19 . Should a subjec t have an Ommaya reservoir and there is no evidence of blockage of CSF flow from the spina l canal , administration of CSF prophylaxis 
through the reservoir is acceptable . Conditioning ch emot herapy (Section 6.5) consisting offludarabine on Day-4, -3, -2 prior to KTE-X19 and cyclophosphamide on Day -2 prior to 
KTE-X19 will be administered. 
Vita ls, Chem panel, and CBC: collected each day prior to CSF prophylaxis and bridging chemotherapy (see Section 7.11.4 and 7.11.S ). CBC 5-part preferred, but 3-part will be 
acceptable. Pe1ipheral blood : Peripheral blood will be collected at screening , and if the subject did not have bridging the rapy than pe1ipheral blood will be collected during day 
-4 and submitted to the central lab. 
8 Neurological assess ment: Subjects neurological status should be evaluated at screening to establish a baseline. After enrollment , subjects should be evaluated for any neurological 
symptoms at each of the timepoints specified in the SOA. During the hospitalization period , evalua tions of neurological status may need to be increased . 
9 Scree ning proced ures (Sectio n 7.11.1): Procedures should be performed within 14 days of enrollment (unless otherwise specified). ECG: must be performed within 30 days prior to 
enrollment ; ECHO: If the last chemotherapy regimen the subject received is not considered cardiotoxic , then an ECHO perform ed within 28 days prior to signing the consen t may be 
used for eligibility. If the last chemotherapy regimen the subjec t received is considered cardiotoxic , then an ECHO performed following the subjects last chemotherapy treatment and 
within 28 days prior to signing the consen t may be used for confirmation of eligibility . CD19: Local CD19 immunophenotyping will be performed at screening on peripheral blood or 
bone marrow aspirate . Surface CD19 express ion should be measured by flow cytometry; IHC analysis is allowed if the bone marrow aspirate is a dry tap, inadequate or there were

Subjects have the right to withdraw from the stud yat an y time and for an y reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care b y the ph ysician or at the institution .
Subjects can decline to continue to receiv estudy  required treatment and/or other protocol 
required procedures at any time during the stud y but continue to participate in the st udy. This is 
referred to as partial withdrawal of consent.
If partial withdrawal of consent occurs, the investigator must discuss with the subject the 
appropriate process for discontinuation from investigational product , study  treatment or other 
protocol required therapies and must discuss options for continu ed participation, completion of 
procedures and the associated data collection as outlined in the SOA .The level of follow -up and 
method of communication should also be discussed between the research s taff and the subject 
anddocumented in the source documents.
Withdraw of full consent for a stud y means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol required therap y or undergo procedures and the subject does not wish to continue 
further stud y follow -
up. Subject data collected up to withdraw of consen t will be retained and
included in the anal ysis of the study , and where permitted by local regulations, publically
available data (death records) can be included after withdraw alof consent. The investigator is to 
discuss with the subject appropriate proc edures for withdrawal from the study .
As part of the stud y sites may be asked to conduct searches of public records, such as those 
establishing survival status, if available, to obtain survival data for any  subject for whom the 
survival status is not know n.Sites may  be also asked to also retrieve autopsy  reports to confirm 
status of disease at the time of death. 
The investigator a nd/or sponsor can also decide to withdraw a subject from the investigational 
product and/or other protocol- required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study  as a whole or 
at an y time prior to study completion.
8.1. Reasons for Removal from Treatment
Reasons for removal from protocol required investigational products or procedures include an y 
of the following:

9.1. Adverse Events
An adverse event is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject. The 
event does not necessarily  have a relationship with study  treatment. The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that an y adverse events observed b y the investigator or reported b y the 
subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. 
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical condition. 
Worsening indicates that t he pre -existing medical condition has increased in severit y, frequency, 
and/or duration or has an association with a worse outcome.  When recording such events, 
provide descriptions that the pre -existing condition has changed (eg, more frequent 
headaches f
or a subject with pre- existing headaches or blood pressure is now more 
increased in a subject with pre -existing hypertension) .  A pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a 
medical procedure while on study , is not considered an adverse event
.
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (such as elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before stud y participation are not considered adverse events.
Hospitalization for study  treatment infusions or precautionary  measures per institutional policy  
are not considered adverse events.
The term “disease progression” or an y relapse after a remission should not be reported as adverse 
events. Death due to disease progression in the absence of signs and s ymptoms of underlying 
disease should be reported as the primary tumor t ype (e g , B-cell ty pe acute leuke mia).
For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the disease under 
investigation report the signs and s ymptoms. Worsening of signs and s ymptoms of the 
malignancy  under stud y should also be reported as adverse events in the appropriate section of 
the CRF. 
The investigators clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is t o be removed from 
treatment due to an adverse event. In the event a subject requests to withdraw from protocol 
required therapies or the study  due to an adverse event, the subject should undergo the 
procedures outlined in the Month 3 visit of the SOA. 
9.1.1. Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
For adverse events, a diagnosis (if known) rather than individual signs and symptoms 
should be recorded on the AE form.  The exception is for CRS where both the diagnosis 
and signs and symptoms will be captured on the CRF AE form.  For signs and symptoms of 
the underlying cancer, the signs and symptoms should be captured.  However, on the AE 
form, the investigator should state that these signs and symptoms are due to the underlying 
disease.
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-103  Amendment 6 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 73of 100 31October 20189.1.2. Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not al l vital sign abnormalities qualify as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be 
reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of the following 
criteria:
Accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding if an isolated vital sign abn ormality should be 
classified as an adverse event.  However, if a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a 
sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (ie, 
hypertension) should be recorded on the CRF.
9.1.3. Reporting Abn ormal Laboratory Findings
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant 
change from the subject’s baseline values.  In gene ral, abnormal laboratory findings 
without clinical significance (based on the investigator’s judgment) are not to be recorded 
as AEs.  However, abnormal laboratory findings that result in new or worsening clinical 
sequelae or that require therapy or adjust ment in current therapy, are considered AEs.  
Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as 
the AE.
An abnormal laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it is a change 
from baseline and mee ts any of the following criteria:
Associated with clinical symptoms
Results in a medical intervention (eg, potassium supplementation for hypokalemia or 
iron replacement therapy for anemia) or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the in vestigator’s judgment 
9.2. Reporting of Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs observed b y the investigator or reported b y 
the subject as follows in Table 5:

See Section 9.5for reporting requirements.  
See Section 6.7for targeted concomitant medications and Section 9.5for targeted SAEs reporting requirements.
See Section 9.5for reporting requirement for non-serious CRS events Grade ≥ 3.
The investigator must address the below AEs: 
Adverse event diagnosis or sy ndrome (if not known, signs or s ymptoms)
Dates of onset and resolution
Severity
Assessment of relatedness to investigational product, chemotherap y or study procedures
Action taken
Adverse event grading scale used will be the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. A cop y of the grading scale can be downloaded from the CTEP 
home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).Cytokine Release S yndrome events will also be reported 
using the grading scale outlined in the KTE- X19 IB. 
In reviewing adverse events, investigators must ass ess whether the adverse event is possibly  
related to 1) leukapheresis, 2) bridging chemotherapy , 3) CSF prophy laxis, 4) Conditioning
chemotherap y, 5) the investigational product ( KTE -X19), or any  protocol required stud y 
procedure. The relationship is indi cated by  a yes or no response and entered into the CRF. A 
yes response should indicate that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study  treatment or procedure and the adverse event. Additional relevant data with respect to 
descri bing the adverse event will be collected in the CRFs.
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-103  Amendment 6 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 75of 100 31October 2018The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or re solution .  If 
a subject begins a new anti
-cancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non- SAEs ends at 
the time the new treatment is started.
9.3. Definition of Serious Adverse Events
A SAE is defined as an AE that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:
Fatal
Life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
An AE would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization” if the event necessitated an 
admission to a healthcare facility  (eg, overnight stay ). 
Events that require an escalation of care when the subject is a lread y hospitalized should 
be recorded as an SAE.  Examples of such events include movement from routine care in 
the hospital to the intensive care unit (ICU) or if that event resulted in a prolongation of 
the existing planned hospitalization. 
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Congenital anomal y/birth defect
Other medicall y important serious event
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any  of 
the serious criteria, the event could be c lassified as an SAE with the criterion of “other 
medically  important serious event.” 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity 
of an adverse event according to NCI CTCAE criteria; the event itself may be of 
relatively minor medical significance and, therefore, may not meet the seriousness 
criteria.  Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse 
event recorded on the CRF.
Progression of the malignancy  during the study  should not be r eported as a AE.However, 
signs and sympotms of disease progression may be recorded as AEs or SAEs and 
indicated as being due to disease progression in the CRF.  If the malignancy has a fatal 
outcome before the end of the SAE reporting period, the the eve nt leading to the death 
must be recorded as an SAE with the outcome of being fatal.

Protocol KTE -C19-103  Amendment 6 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 76of 100 31October 20189.3.1. Hospitalization and Prolonged Hospitalization
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a SAE as described in Section 9.5.  
The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be SAEs:
Hospitalization for palliative care or hospice care
Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (eg, for monitor ing of the subject or to 
perform an efficacy measurement for the study)
Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition
Hospitalization due to progression of the underlying cancer
9.4. Reporting Deaths
Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE rep orting period, irrespective of any 
intervening treatment.
Any death occurring after the first dose of chemotherapy, for the purpose of 
pre-conditioning, and within 3 months of KTE -X19 infusion , regardless of attribution to 
treatment, requires expedited rep orting within 24 hours.  Any death occurring after the 
SAE reporting period requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is considered 
related to treatment.  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period that are attribute d by 
the investigator solely to progression of underlying leukemia should be recorded as SAEs 
with the preferred term “chronic lymphocytic leukemia” and must be reported 
immediately to the sponsor.  
Death is an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded on the AE form.  Every effort should 
be made to capture the established cause of death, which may become available later on 
(eg, after autopsy).
9.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse E vents
The investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs observed b y the investigator or reported b y 
the subject.  Unless otherwise indicated in Table 6 below, all SAEs will be reported within 
24hours and recorded in the CRF.

See Section 6.8for concomitant medication and Section 9.2for targeted AE reporting requirements.
All SAEs must be submitted to Kite via email to  within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event and using a SA E report form.
Subsequently , all SAEs will be reported to the health authorities per local reporting guidelines.
9.6. Pregnancy and Lactation
There is no relevant clinical experience with KTE -X19 in pregnant or lactating women, and 
animal reproductive studies h ave not been performed.  Women of child bearing potential must 
have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment because of the potentially dangerous effects of 
the preparative chemotherap y on the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should be 
monitore d according to local and country -specific regulations.   This experimental therap y 
should not be administered to pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.
Female subjects and female partners of male subjects are recommended to use highly 
effective cont raception (method must achieve an annual failure rate of < 1%) for at least 
6months after conditioning chemotherapy dosing .  Male subjects are recommended to not
father a child for 6 months after the conditioning chemotherapy dosing.
If a pregnancy
 occurs in a female subject enrolled into the study , or a female partner of a male 
subject within 6 months of completing the KTE- X19 infusion, the pregnancy  must be reported to
the key  sponsor contact.  In formation regarding the pregnancy  and/or the outcome may  be 
requested b y the key  sponsor.

PPD
CONFIDENTIAL Page 78of 100 31October 2018In addition to reporting any  pregnancies occurring during the study , investigators should monitor 
for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of conditioning chemotherapy through 6 months 
for female subjects and for 6 months for the female partner of the male subjects.
The pregnancy  should be reported to the key  sponsor contact within 24 hours of the investigators 
knowledge of the pregnancy  event. 
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol required therapies report the 
lactation case to the key  sponsor contact.
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for 
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol required thera pies through 6months.
Any lactation case should be reported to the key  sponsor contact within 24 hours of the 
investi gator’s knowledge of the event.
9.7. Safety Review Team and Dose -limiting Toxicity
The SRT ,that is internal to the study  sponsor and in collaboration with at least one stud y 
investigator, will be specifically  chartered to review safet y data from the first 3-12subjects 
treated with KTE -X19 and make recommendations on further study  conduct and pr ogression of 
the study  based on the incidence of KTE- X19 DLT and review of serious adverse events.
Dose -limiting toxicity  is defined as the following KTE-X19- related events with onset within the 
first 28 days following KTE -X19 infusion:
Grade 4 hematologic toxicit y lasting more than 30 days (except ly mphopenia) if not 
attributable to underl ying disease
AllKTE-X19-related grade 3 non- hematologic toxicities lasting for > 7 days and all 
KTE-X19- related grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities regardless of duration are considered 
DLTs, with the exception of the following which are not considered DLTs:
Aphasia/d ysphasia or confusion/cognitive disturbance which resolves to at least grade 1
or baseline within 2 weeks and to 
at least baseline within 4 weeks.  
Fever gra de 3 or 4
Immediate h ypersensitivity  reactions occurring within 2 hours of KTE -X19 infusion 
(related to KTE -X19 infusion) that are reversible to a grade 2 or less within 24 hours of 
KTE -X19 infusion with standard therap y
Renal toxicity  which requires dialy sis for≤7 days
Intubation for airway  protection if ≤ 7 day s

Grade 3 transaminase, alkaline phosphatas e, bilirubin or other liver function test 
elevation, provided there is resolution to ≤ grade 2 within 14 days
Grade 4 transient serum hepatic enz yme abnormalities provided there is resolution to 
≤grade 3 within < 72 hours
Hypogammaglobulinemia grade 3 or 4
Grade 3 nausea and/or anorexia
CRS will be graded according to a revised grading s ystem ( Lee et al, 2014 ).  Adverse events 
attributed to CRS w ill be mapped to the overall CRS grading assessment for the determination of 
DLT.  Consistent with non- CRS toxicities, all occurrences of grade 3 CRS of duration > 7 day s
and all occurrences of grade 4 CRS are considered DL Ts, other than occurrences of CRS due to 
the exceptions listed above.
Three subjects will initially  be enrolled to evaluate the safet y of the KTE- X19 regimen.  Subjects 
will be evaluated for DLTs within the first 28 days following the completion of the KTE- X19
infusion.  The anal ysis of D LTs will be based on the DLT evaluable set as defined in 
Section 10.5.  The SRT will make recommendations based on the incidence of DLT and overall 
safet y profile of the 
KTE -X19 regimen as outlined below :
If the subject incidence of DLT is 0 of 3 subjects, the SRT may  recommend either
proceeding to Phase 2at 2 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg ; or 
accrual of additional subjects in Phase 1 to further characterize risk/benefit prior to 
Phase 2
If the subject incidence of DLT is 1 of 3 subjects, the SRT may  recommend either
accrual of an additional 3 subjects at the same cell dose with re -evaluation of the 
incidence of DLT after a total of 6 subjects in the DL T evaluable set have been assessed 
for DLT
.  In this case, the SRT may  recommend accrual to Phase 2 if the cumulative 
incidence of DLT in the 6 subjects is ≤1 of 6 subjects; or 
evaluation of a lower dose of 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg in an additional set of 
3-6subjects .  In this case, the SRT may  recommend accrual to Phase 2 if the cumulative 
incidence of DLT is < 33%.
If the subject incidence of DLT is ≥ 2 of 3 subjects, a lower dose of 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR
T cells/kg in an additional set of 3-6 subjects will be explored .  In this case, the SRT may  
recommend accrual to Phase 2 if the cumulative incidence of DLT is < 33%.
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-103  Amendment 6 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 80of 100 31October 2018If the conditioning chemotherap y regimen and KTE -X19 dose evaluated in Phase 1 is 
determined to be safe b ased on the incidence of DLT , up to approximately  40additional subjects 
(high and non -high burden disease) may be enrolled at 2 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg ,
1
x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg , or 0.5 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg prior to commencing 
Phase 2. The data from these additional subjects will be reviewed b y the SRT who will provide 
recommendations for dose for Phase 2.  Further details to be outlined in the SRT Charter.
Based on the review of all available safety and efficacy data, the benefit/risk  ratio was 
considered most favorable  at the dose of 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg, therefore the 
dose of 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg was considered the recommended Phase 2 dose. 
The final decision to commence Phase 2 and the dose selected for Phase 2 wasformall y 
communicated to participating sites in a separate communication.
9.8. Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be chartered to review safet y data 
to make trial conduct recommendations. The DSMB will review safet y data inaninterim 
analysis during the Phase 2 portion of the study .  For thisinterim analy sis, the D SMB will 
review safet y data after 20 Phase 2 subjects have been treated with KTE- X19 and had the 
opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after the KTE -X19 infusion.  During Phase 2, Kite 
Pharma or delegate will submit SAEs or suspected unexpected serious ad verse reactions 
(SUSARs) to the DSMB chair for risk benefit analy sis.The DSMB Chair will review reported 
SAEs at least monthly  and SUSARs as soon as received.  .  
9.9.
Criteria to Pause Enrollment
Study  enrollment will be paused in Phase 1 (DLT Evaluation Pe riod) following an y grade 5 
adverse event that occurs within 30 day s of KTE -X19 dosing regardless of attributions.   The 
DLT evaluation period is now complete (see Section 2.8).
As part of its oversight of the study , the DSMB also will assess criteria to pause enrollment in 
Phase 2after 10, 20, and 35 subjects enrolled in Phase 2have been treated with KTE
-X19 and
have had the opportunity  to be followed for 30days.  Enrollment will be paused if an y ofthe 
following is met:
Subject incidence of the following grade 4 KTE-X19- related adverse events lasting more than

10.1. Hypothesis
This study  is designed to differentiate between a treatment that has a true overall complete 
remission rate of 40% or less and a tr eatment with a true overall complete remission rate of 65% 
or more. The h ypothesis is that the overall complete remission rate to KTE- X19 is significantl y 
greater than 40%.
A secondary  endpoint, Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Rate, will be tested against 
a MRD- negative rate of 30% if the testing of the overall complete remission rate is significant.
The hy pothesis is that the MR D-negative rate to KTE -X19 is significantly  greater than 30%.
10.2. Study Endpoints
10.2.1. Primary
Phase 1: I ncidence of adverse events defined as dose -limiting toxicities (DLT)
Phase 2:  Overall complete remission rate (CR + CRi) per independent review (Appendix 1).  All 
subjects that do not meet the criteria for CR or CRiby the anal ysis data cutoff date will be 
considered non
-responders for the overall complete remission rate evaluation .
10.2.2. Secondary
Duration of Remission (DOR): for subjects who experience CR or CRi per independent
review , DOR is defined as the time between their first complete response per indepedent
review to relapse or any death in the absence of documented relapse.  Relapse is defined in 
Appendix 1.  Subjects who do not meet the criteria for relapse and who have not died will be 
censored at the last evaluable di sease assessment or disease status follow up assessment . A 
sensitivity  anal ysis will be conducted in which non
-disease mortalit y will be considered a 
competing risk.   Disease assessments obtained after new anti -cancer therapies (including 
allogeneic SCT )
will notcontribute to the derivation of duration of remission . The DOR for 
subjects that undergo allogeneic SCT while in remission is censored at the date of the 
allogeneic SCT; the DOR for subjects that undergo other new anti -cancer therapies in the 
absence of documented relapse is censored at the last evaluable disease assessment prior to 
the new anti -cancer therapies.  
In subjects who achieve CR, a TKI  may  be resumed 2 months after KTE -X19 infusion .  In 
such subjects who resume TKI therap y, disease assessments obtained after resumption of 
TKI therap y will contribute to the derivation of the duration of remission.  A sensitivity  
analysis will be conducted in which the duration of remission in such subjects is censored at 
the first date of th e resumption of TKI  therapy .

10.2.4. Covariates
The primary  endpoints and selected secondary  endpoints will be evaluated in subgroup anal ysis 
by subjects with or without prior blinatumomab , and by  subjects with or without prior 
inotuzumab. Such subgroup anal yses may  not be performed if too few (eg , n < 5) subjects in the 
mITT set have received prior blinatumomab or prior inotuzumab at the time of the analy sis. 
Additional covariates and subgroup anal yseswill be outlined in the St atistical Anal ysis Plan.
10.3. Sample Size Considerations
The anticipated enrollment in this study  is approximately  100 subjects.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint and all anal yses based on the response will be based on a mITT 
population consisting of all subjects who receive any dose of KTE -X19 in Phase 2.  
This study  uses a single
-arm design to test for an improvement in overall complete remission 
rate.  For the test of efficacy  this study  hasapproximately  93% power to distinguish between an 
active therap y with a 65% true overall complete remission rate from a therapy  with an overall 
complete remission rate of 40% or less with a 1- sided alpha level of 0.025. A step- down test of 
the secondary endpoint MRD -negative Rate will be performed against a MRD -negative rate of 
30% if the testing of the overall complete remission rate is significant. 
In Phase 1, the SRT wi ll review safet y data after 3 subjects in the DLT evaluable set (see 
Section 10.5) have had the opportunity  to be followed for 28 day s after the KTE -X19 infusion.  
If the conditioning regimen and KTE- X19 dose evaluated in Phase 1 is determined to be safe 
based on the incidence of DL T, up to approximately  30 additional subjects may  be enrolled to 
further evaluate safet y prior to commencing Phase 2. 
During Phase 2, one interim and one primary  analy ses will be performed.  The i nterim anal ysis is 
for safety  only and will occur after 20 subjects have been treated with KTE -X19 andhave had 
the opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after theKTE- X19 infusion.     The primary  anal ysis 
will occur when the overall study  enrollment is complete and all subject in the mI TT set have 
had the opportunity  to complete the month 6disease assessment. 65%
Approximately
100subjects may be enrolled into the entire study . At the time of the primary anal ysis, in the 
event that either less than or more than 50 subjects are eligible for the mITT set, all mI TT 
eligible subjects will be included in the analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 84of 100 31October 201810.4. Statistical Assumptions
This study  assumes that the underl yingoverall complete remission rate (in the absence of 
treatment with investigational therap y) is 40%. For MRD -rate, it is assumed that the underl ying 
response rate (in the absence of treatment with investigational ther apy) is 30%.
10.5. Analysis Subsets   
KTE
-X19 will be administered as a single infusion at a target dose of 2 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells/kg or 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg or 0.5 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg .  For 
subjects weighing greater than 100 kg, a maximum fla tdose of 2 x 108or 1 x 108or 0.5 x 108
anti-CD19 CAR T cells /kgmay be administered.  Full Anal ysis Set:  the full analy sis set will 
consist of all enrolled subjects and will be used for summaries of subject disposition.
Modified Intent ion-to-treat Set (mI TT):  the modified intent ion-to-treat set will consist of all 
subjects enrolled in Phase 2and treated with KTE -X19.  ThemITT analysis set will be used for 
all efficacy  analy sesunless otherwise specified
.
DLT-evaluable set: All Phase 1 subjects treated with the target KTE- X19 dose and followed for 
at least 28 day s, or received a dose of KTE- X19 lower than the target dose but experienced a 
DLT during the 28 day  post infusion period, up to the time at which a dose level has been 
evaluated for DLT and deemed safe.  Additional Phase 1 subjects enrolled and treated 
subsequently  for the purpose of assessment of the overall safety  in the same dose level or a lower 
dose level will not be considered as part of the DLT evaluable set, and DLT will not be a ssessed 
for such subjects.
Safety  analysis set:  the safet y set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of KTE- X19.
10.6. Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments
This is a single arm, open -label study  and subjects and investigators will be aware of treatment 
received. Data handling procedures will be devised to reduce potential sources of bias and 
maintain the validity  and credibility  of the study .These procedures will be outlined in the study  
statistical analy sis plan, DSMB c harter, and Trial I ntegrity  Document.
10.7. Interim Analysis
During Phase 1, t he SRT will review safety  data after 3 DLT evaluable subjects have had the 
opportunity  to be followed for 28 day s after the KTE -X19 infusion.  The SRT will review the 
safet y data and m ake recommendations on further study  conduct and progression of the study  as 
outlined in Section 9.6.
During Phase 2, the DSMB will review 
safet y data after 20 Phase 2 subjects have been treated 
and followed for 30 day s. The DSMB will also review SAEs on a monthly basis prior to the 
primary  analysis.The DSMB may  request additional safet y data or modifying the stud y conduct.
The sponsor may  request additional reviews by  the DSMB if safet y concerns are identified. Data 
submitted to the DSMB may not have undergone completion of data cleaning procedures in 
order to facilitate timelines for DSMB review .

CONFIDENTIAL Page 85of 100 31October 201810.8. Planned Method of Analysis
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be performed when all subject in the mITT set have had the 
opportunity  tocomplete the month 6 disease assessment .Additional analy ses may  occur after 
the primary  analy sis has been completed .  These additional analy ses will be descriptive and will 
occur after inferential testing has been performed.  The final analy sis will occur when all subjects 
have completed the stu
dy.  
10.8.1. Overall Complete Remission Rate
The incidence of response and exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated.  An 
exact binomial test will be used to compare the observed response rate to a response rate of 40%.
10.8.2. Duration of Re mission
Durati on of Remission (DOR): for subjects who experience CR or CRi per independent review, 
DOR is defined as the time between their first complete response per independent review to 
relapse or an y death in the absence of documented relapse.  Relapse is defined inAppendix 1.  
Subjects who do not meet the criteria for relapse and who have 
not died will be censored at the 
last evaluable disease assessment or di sease status follow up assessment. Disease assessments 
obtained after new anti- cancer therapies (including allogeneic SCT) will not contribute to the 
derivation of duration of remission. The DOR for subjects that undergo allogeneic SCT while in 
remission i s censored at the date of the allogeneic SCT; the DOR for subjects that undergo other 
new anti -cancer therapies in the absence of relapse is censored at the last evaluable disease 
assessment prior to the new anti -cancer therapies.  Kaplan -
Meier estimates and 2 -sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be generated for DOR.  Estimates of the proportion of subjects 
remained as in complete remission at 3 -month intervals will be provided.
A sensitivity  anal ysis of DOR will be conducted in which non- disease mortality will be 
considered a competing risk. A competing -risk analy sis method (Klein and Moeschberger 2005 ; 
Putter et al, 2007 ) will be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse.  The cumulative 
incidence of relapse in the presence non -disease related mortality  (the competing risk) will be 
estimated along with 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals at 3 -monthly  time intervals.  
10.8.3. MRD -negative rate
The incidence of MRD -
negative rate and exact 2- sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
generated.  If the statistical testing of the primary  endpoint (overall complete remission rate) is 
significant, an exact binomial test will be used to compare the observed MRD -negative rate to a 
rate of 30% at a one -sided alpha level of 0.025 .
10.8.4. CR Rate, CR
i Rate, and DOR to Treatment Among Subjects Retreated with 
KTE -X19 for Progressive D isease after 
Initial Remission
The incidence of CR rate, and CRi rate, and exact 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
generated.
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-103  Amendment 6 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 86of 100 31October 2018DOR to retreatment is defined only  for subjects who experience a CR or CRi to retreatment and 
is the time from the first complete remission after retreatment to relapse after retreatment or 
death due to disease relapse. The competing- risk anal ysis method will be used to estimate the 
cumulative incidence of relapse after retreat ment.
10.8.5. Overall Survival
Kaplan -Meier estimates and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated for OS.   
Estimates of the proportion of subjects alive at 3 -month intervals will be provided.
10.8.6. Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Rate
The incidence of Allogen eic SCT in the mI TT set and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
generated.
10.8.7. Safety
Subject incidence rates of adverse events including all, serious, fatal, CTCAE version 4 .03
grade 3 or higher and treatment related AEs reported throughout the conduct o f the study  will be 
tabulated b y preferred term and/or system organ class. CTCAE grade changes in safet y 
laboratory  values will be summarized with descriptive statistics. The incidence of c oncomitant 
medications willbesummarized.
Tables and/or narratives of deaths and treatment related SAEs will be provided.
10.8.8. Long -term Data Analysis
All subjects will be followed for survival for up to approximately  15 y ears after the last subject
receives their KTE -X19 infusion . No formal h ypothesis testing will be performed based on data 
obtained after the cutoff for the primary  anal ysis.Descriptive estimates of key  efficacy  and 
safet y analyses may be updated to assess the overall treatment profile.

FOLLOWING KTE -X19 INFUSION
The post -infusion monitoring of subjects, described in s ection 
7.11.7.2 in this protocol, will 
be extended by monitoring on Day 8, Day 9, and Day 10, according to procedures outlined 
in the Schedule of A ssessment Table, column “IP administration period, 1 -7”. The subject 
may stay hospitalized or return to the clinic daily for this extended monitoring at the 
discretion of the investigator.
The daily monitoring will include vital signs (see section 7.4), blood draw for chemistry 
panel with 
CRP, ferritin ( and LDH if indicated as per section 7.11.7.4) , blood draw for 
CBC w/differential, and neurological assessment (see section 7.5). Any observed toxicity 
will be managed according to section 6.10 of this protocol.

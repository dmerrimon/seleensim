3. To compare the trial participant satisfaction with each route of administration to improve  patient -based 
outcomes. This will be done by administering a satisfaction survey at the end of the trial. As participants will have study drug placed both buccally  and vaginally, they will be uniquely able to comment on comfort and 
preference for route of  delivery.

 Inclus ion/Exclusion Criteria  
 The following are inclusion criteria for the IMPROVE study.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
 
• A medical indication for induction of labor at a gestational age between 37 
0/7 and 38 6/7 weeks  OR an 
elective or medical indication for induction of labor at a gestational age ≥  39 0/7 completed weeks  
• Participant age ≥ 14 years old  
• Singleton pregnancy  
• Modified Bishop score ≤ 6  
• Vertex fetal presentation  by examination or ultrasound 
• Any membrane status  
Exclusion Criteria:  
 
• Elective inductions between 37 0/7 and 38 6/7 are specifically excluded  
• Known intrauterine fetal demise  
• Any uterine scar including prior cesarean section and myomectomy  
• Known major fetal congenital malformations that may impact neonatal health  
• Other evidence of fetal compromise  (such as  Category 2 or 3 tracing) before the induction begins  
• Prior induction/cervical ripening methods utilized  during this pregnancy  
• Allergy to misoprostol  
• Known u ntreated cervical infection (e.g. Gonorrhea, Chlamydia)  
• Planned cesarean section due to maternal or fetal condition  
• Any other contraindication to labor induction or misoprostol therapy

Stat
istical Considerations  
 
In our preliminary retrospective analysis of our institutional data over the last 1 -2 years, there was just over a 4 
hour difference in the time to delivery between the routes of administra tion.  This was confirmed using a 
survival estimate for the two groups, with buccal misoprostol having a median time to delivery of 16.95 hours and vaginal 12.78 hours. In order to demonstrate a significant difference in a non -inferiority test of two survival 
curves with a limit of 4.5 hours, we will need 143 women in each group (see table below). We will recruit 300 women total to accommodate up to 5% withdrawals. We do not anticipate loss to follow -up as once women 
begin an induction, it is extremely rare  that induction is terminated. Women remain admitted to labor and 
delivery until they are discharged after delivery .

We plan to analyze the primary outcome using survival curve analysis due  to the possibility of cesarean delivery 
truncating the time to delivery. All outcomes will be compared using an intent -to-treat methodology. Discreet 
outcomes will be compared using chi -square testing and continuous variables will use appropriate parametr ic 
and nonparametric tests.  PK analysis will follow standard  techniques for comparison of standard parameters and will be fitted to the most 
appropriate compartmental model. Our investigator team has the expertise to perform these analyses and has a large  body of experience with pregnancy pharmacology studies.

Study Title: A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of BBI608 in Combination with Temo zolomide for 
Adult Patients with Recurrent or Progressed Glioblastoma 
Study Number: BBI608-201GBM
Study Phase: Ib/II
Study Drug BBI608, a novel investigational small molecule anticancer drug that targets  
cancer stem cells 
Primary Objectives: The primary objective of this phase Ib/II study is to determine  t h e  s a f e t y ,  
tolerability, and preliminary anti -cancer activity of BBI608 in combination with
temozolomide (TMZ) in adult patients with recurrent or progress ive 
glioblastoma (GBM) who have not received prior treatment with b evacizumab. 
Patients who are eligible for further surgical resection will b e enrolled into Arm 
A.  Patients who are not eligible for further resection will be  enrolled into Arm 
B.
The primary efficacy endpoint will be progression -free survival at 6- months 
(PFS -6), defined as the proportion of patients who have survived without  
objective disease progression per RANO criteria for at least 6 months after 
enrollment. Secondary endpoints will include median progression  free survival 
(PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and o bjective response 
rate (ORR) (when applicable).
Secondary 
Objectives:To determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of BBI608 and of BBI60 8 plus TMZ 
when administered to this population.
To determine the pharmacodynamics (biomarkers) of BBI608 in res ected 
glioblastoma tissue (when applicable).
Study Design: This is an open-label, multi-center, phase Ib/II study of BBI608 a dministered in 
combination with TMZ to patients with recurrent or progressive GBM who have 
not received prior bevacizumab therapy.
ARM A: Patients who are candidates for surgical resection will receive BBI608 
asmonotherapy prior to resection, followed by post- operative BBI608 
administered in combination with TMZ.
BBI608 will be administered at a dose -level of 480 mg twice daily for 7 (±2)
days prior to a planned surgical resection or biopsy of recurre nt GBM.  BBI608 
will be discontinued immediately prior to the surgical procedur e and will remain 
discontinued pending clinical post -operative recovery of the patient.  
Upon the clinical recovery of the patient and at a time between 15- 28 days 
following surgery, BBI608 will be administered orally, daily, i n combination 
with temozolomide that is administered at 150 mg/m2for days 1 through 5 of 
each 28 day cycle The dose of temozolomide can be increased to 200 mg/m2as 
per standard TMZ dosing guidelines for patients who complete at lea st one cycle 
at 150 mg/m2.  The initial dose of BBI608 will be 480 mg twice daily. Dose 
adjustment is allowed.

BBI608 will be 
administered orally, daily, at a dose
-level of 480 mg 
twice daily for 7( ± 2 )  days
prior to a scheduled resection for recurrent GBM.    BBI608 will be administered orally, 
daily, at a dose -level of 480 mg twice 
daily in combination with TMZ 150 
mg/m2that is administered on days 1
through 5 of each 28 -day cycle. Cycles 
will repeat until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion is met.
Approximately 7( ± 2 )  days Begins between 15-28-days after surgery
ARM B: Patients who are not candidates for surgical resect ion will receive 
BBI608 administered orally, daily, in combination with temozolo mide 150 
mg/m2that is administered on days 1 through 5 of each 28-day cycle.  The dose 
of temozolomide can be increased to 200 mg/m2as per standard TMZ dosing 
guidelines for patients who complete at least one cycle at 150 mg/m2.  The 
initial dose of BBI608 will be 480 mg twice daily. Dose adjustm ent is allowed.
In the phase Ib/DLT cohort portion of this study, f or both Arms A and B, 
pharmacokinetics will be evaluated on Day 1 and Day 5 of combina tion therapy 
with BBI608 and TMZ.  Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated in all  patients 
who undergo surgical resection. 
For patients in Arm A during the run -in period with BBI608 monotherapy, the 
same DLT rules as for the combination t herapy will appl y.  Enrollment will be 
held if ≥2 patients are unable to undergo res ection due to DLTs. Enrollment will 
also be held if  ≥ 2 patients have an unexpected surgical complication.
Initial enrollment will be to a 6 -patient safety cohort in each arm.  These patients 
will be evaluated for the occurrence of DLT during the first 28  d a y s  o f  
combination treatment with BBI608 and TMZ.  If DLT is observed in ≥ 2 of 6 
patients evaluable for DLT, the initial dose of BBI608 for all patients in that arm
will be reduced to the next lower dose level of 240mg twice daily and an 
additional 6 -patient safety cohort will be enrolled at that dose- level and 
evaluated for DLT as above.  Enrollment will continue at a dose -level at which 
≤ 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT.   Dose modification is allowed according to 
the standard schedule for BBI608. 
It is e xpected that up to 30 patients (including those enrolled to the DLT 
evaluation cohorts) will be enrolled in each arm.
For all patients on study, tumor assessments will be performed at eight- week 
intervals or as clinically indicated.  Disease status will be assessed by  contrast-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. 
Progression Free Survival will be assessed from the date of enrollment until 
objective disease progression or death. Tumor response an d progression will be 
evaluated using RANO criter ia.  Patients who are enrolled in Arm A but who do 
not undergo surgical resection will be considered evaluable for  tumor response
utilizing the same assessment criteria as employed for patients in Arm B. All
patients will be followed for dise ase progression and included in time -to-event 
analyses.
Patients will continue treatment with BBI608 and TMZ until the investigator has 
determined that they are no longer clinically benefiting due to progression of

Confidential Page 4  disease, or unacceptable toxicity, or until another discontinuatio n criterion is 
met.  Treatment with BBI608 as monotherapy can continue if TMZ is 
discontinued for any reason. Also, the investigator may continu e BBI608 in 
combination with TMZ or BBI608 monotherapy after the initial de monstration 
of radiological progression and in the absence of intolerable t oxicities, 
performance status decline, worsening of disease related sympto ms, 
radiographical findings that would warrant acute intervention a nd no ongoing 
severe toxicities that may be related to BBI608.  The patient w ill also get repeat 
tumor assessments after 4 -6 weeks.  Treatment with BBI608 (with or without 
TMZ) will continue until unacceptable toxicity, further disease  p r o g r e s s i o n  
(clinical or radiologi cal), or another discontinuation criterion is met.
Safety will be evaluated for the duration of the study. Adverse  events will be 
documented using the current version of the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0).  
Study Populations: This study will enroll patients with histologically confirmed g lioblastoma 
(GBM) at first recurrence of disease following front -line therapy.
Patients must have received prior  treatment with standard first  line therapy for 
GBM , including maximal surgical resection and postoperative externa l-beam 
radiotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiation with TMZ is allowed but  n o t  
mandatory.
Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have unequivocal e vidence of tumor 
recurrence/progression by MRI a minimum of 12 weeks following c ompletion 
of radiation ther apy or TMZ-Radiotherapy . Patients who have received prior 
bevacizumab or other anti -VEGF agents are not eligible to enroll.  
Baseline MRI should be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment. 
Other key inclusion criteria include ECOG status of 0-1 (KPS ≥ 70%) and 
adequate bone marrow, hepatic , and renal function at baseline.
Test Product, Dose, 
and Mode of 
Administration: BBI608 will be administered orally, twice-daily, at an initial dos e-level of 480 
mg twice daily .  The first dose should be adminis tered in the morning and the 
second dose should be administered approximately 12 hours later.  The doses 
should be administered with fluids, one hour prior to or two hours after meals.
The BBI608 dose can be modified a ccording to the following sche dule:
Dosing Level Description
Initial Dose 480 mg twice daily   (960 mg total daily)
Modification Level –1 240 mg twice daily   (480 mg total daily)
Modification Level –2 80 mg twice daily     (160 mg total daily)
Modification Level –3 80 mg once daily (80 mg total daily)
TMZ will be administered orally, once daily, at a dose of 150 m g/m2daily on 
days 1 through 5 of each 28 -day study cycle. T he dose of temozolomide can be 
increased to 200 mg/m2as per standard TMZ dosing guidelines for patient s who 
complete at least one cycle at 150 mg/m2.
Duration of 
Treatment: For an individual patient, treatment with BBI608 and TMZ will c ontinue until 
unacceptable toxicity, disease p rogression (clinical or radiolo gical) ,or another 
discontinuation criterion is met.  Treatment with BBI608 as mon otherapy can 
continue if TMZ is discontinued for any reason.  Also, the inve stigator may 
continue BBI608 in combination with TMZ or BBI608 monotherapy a fter the 
initial demonstration of radiographic progression and in the ab sence of 
intolerable toxicities.  The patient will also get repeat tumor  assessments after 4-
6 weeks. Treatment with BBI608 (with or without TMZ) will conti nue until 
unacceptable toxicity, further disease progression (clinical or  radiological), or

Criteria for 
Determination of Dose
-Limiting 
Toxicity: A DLT is defined by the occurrence of any of the following toxi cities possibly, 
probably or definitely related to BBI608 or to BBI608 in combination with T MZ
during the first 28 days of combination treatment: 
xCTCAE Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant blee ding
xCTCAE Grade 4 hemato logical toxicity. 
xCTCAE Grade 3 non-hemato logical toxicity, except:
oGrade 3 nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarr hea or fatigue that 
persist <7 days with appropriate supportive care.
xCTCAE Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity
oBecause DVT and PE are common complications among GBM 
patients, the first occurrence of DVT or PE will not be 
considered a DLT. 
xToxicities le ading to delay of study treatment for ≥ 14 days
xDuring the post- surgical period and prior to initiation of combination 
therapy with BBI608 and TMZ, any grade 3 or greater hematologic al 
or non- hematological toxicity that cannot be attributed to the surgica l
procedure or to typical post-operative complications
xAny other toxicity that in the view of the Principal Investigat or represents 
a clinically significant hazard to the patient 
Whether a DLT has occurred will be assessed during the first 28  d a y s  o f  
comb ination therapy.  DLTs will be determined from adverse events, and 
changes from baseline in physical examination findings and in laboratory 
parameters.  Patients who do not complete 28 days of combinatio n therapy for 
reasons other than DLT may be replaced.
Adverse events considered related to TMZ only will not be consi dered DLTs for 
BBI608 in combination with TMZ. 
Pharmacokinetic 
and Pharmacodynamic Variables: Pharmacokinetic variables to be determined include maximum plas ma drug 
concentration (Cmax), area under the time- concentration curve (AUC), and 
terminal half -life. Blood samples for PK determination will be drawn over 12
h o u r s  o n  D a y  1  a n d  a g a i n  o n  D a y  5  o f  Cycle 1 of BBI608 and TMZ 
combination therapy. Archival tissue (15 -30 unstained slides or t issue block) 
from primary tumor resection will be collected from all patient s.  When 
possible, the following tissue will be collected from the repea t resection 
procedure: fresh frozen tissue and formalin fixed, paraffin -embedded, tissue. 
Archival samples will be used to examine potential predictive b iomarkers for 
therapeutic activity of BBI608 or of BBI608 plus TMZ, while samples obtained 
from the on -study resection procedure will be used to investigate evidence of 
BBI608 presence in resected tumor tissue and to evaluate pharmacodynamics. 
Statistical Methods: In general, categorical variables will be summarized as the num ber and 
percentage of patients in each category. Continuous variables w ill be 
summarized by the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, an d maximum.
The primary population for the efficacy endpoints will be the P er Protocol 
population defined as the population of patients who have been treated with at 
least 80% of 1 complete cycle of BBI608 and TMZ. Analyses will also be 
performed on the Intent-to- Treat (ITT) population in each arm. Analyses will 
also be performed on The primary endpoint is PFS- 6, defined as the proportion 
of patients with PFS (i.e. absence of documented objective prog ression or death) 
Boston Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 6  at 6 months after enrollment.
With a sample size of 30 patients, the lower bound of the two -sided 80% 
confidence interval, as estimated by the exact binomial method using a projected 
PFS-6 rate of 20%, will be greater than 10%, a nd provides meaningful 
information for further clinical evaluation.
The secondary endpoints will include OS (overall survival), def ined as the 
interval between the date of patient enrollment until death; PF S (progression 
free survival), defined as the interval between the date of patient enrollment and 
objective progression or death; ORR (objective response rate), the proportion of 
patients with a documented comp lete response or partial respons e according to 
the RANO criteria; and DCR (disease control rate), the proporti on of patients 
with documented stable disease, partial response, or complete r esponse 
according to RANO criteria. 
Safety analyses will include adverse events, SAEs, laboratory t ests, and physical 
examination changes from baseline.  All patients receiving at l east one daily 
dose of BBI608 will be considered evaluable for safety analyses .  In addition to 
the evaluation and categorization of adverse events, listings o f laboratory test 
results collected at baseline and during the study will be gene rated.  Descriptive 
statistics summarizing the changes in those laboratory tests ov er time will be 
presented.

1.1 Scientific Background of BBI608 
Recent studies have uncovered the presence of cancer stem cells  (CSCs, also called tumor 
initiating cells or cancer stem-like cells), which have self-re newal capability and are 
considered to be fundamentally responsible for malignant growth , relapse, and metastasis. 
Importantly, CSCs are inherently resistant to conventional ther apies. Therefore, a targeted 
agent with activity against cancer stem cells holds great promi se for cancer patients [Boman 
and Wicha, 2008; Clevers, 2011; Lobo et al., 2007; Magee et al., 2012; Singh and Settleman, 2010). Specifically in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), CSCs have been r eported to be 
responsible for both disease pathogenesis and resistance of GBM  to therapy  [Singh 2004, 
Chen 2012, Bao 2006, Beier 2008].
BBI608 is a small molecule that targets cancer by blocking self -renewal of and inducing 
apoptosis in cancer stem cells. While not a kinase inhibitor, B BI608 works by inhibiting the 
STAT3 pathway. With their proprietary target discovery technolo gy TPIV®, scientists at 
Boston Biomedical, Inc. have dis covered that STAT3 pathway acti vity is critical for the self-
renewal and survival of cancer stem cells in human cancer, incl uding GBM
.
1.2 Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) 
GBM is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In the U nited States, 3,336 new cases 
of GBM were estimated to occur in 2012, and 2,055 of these pati ents died from this disease 
[NCI SEER] . GBM accounts for approximately 50% of all primary brain tumors . 
Unfortunately, GBM patients have f ew treatment options: standar d of care consists of 
maximal resection of tumor followed by chemoradiotherapy with t emozolomide (TMZ), an 
oral alkylating agent, with additional TMZ chemotherapy until p rogression of disease, which 
is the unfortunate outcome in nearly all patients. Despite mult imodality treatment, prognosis 
with standard of care treatment remains poor, as median surviva l is 15-17 months [Stupp 
2005; Chinot 2014] .
A retrospective review of 168 recurrent-GBM patients from a sin gle center suggested that 
retreatment at relapse may lead to increase in progression free  survival (PFS) as well as in 
overall survival (OS) [Hau 2003] . Standard treatment for recurrent GBM includes 
chemotherapy, usually administered until evidence of further di sease progression, and 
possible tumor debulking in select patients. A randomized Phase  3 study comparing TMZ to 
nitrosoureas in chemotherapy-naïve patients with recurrent GBM reported no statistically 
significant difference between these two treatment arms. For th e TMZ arm, the study 
reported a median PFS of 5 months and a median OS of 8.5 months  [Brada 2010] . A Phase 
II study of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GBM followin g adjuvant first-line TMZ 
treatment resulted in an objective response rate of 28%, 6 mont h PFS of 43%, and a 
decreased need for steroids, but did not result in a prolonged OS [Cloughesy 2010] . Overall, 
there is a lack of standard sec ond-line therapy recommendations . Management of patients 
Boston Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 14  with recurrent GBM is difficult and no re-intervention has been  proven to lead to meaningful 
improvement in OS. 
At this time, treatment options for patients with recurrent GBM  are limited to therapy with 
TMZ or bevacizumab, possible repeat tumor debulking, considerat ion of non-conventional 
radiotherapy with no established guidelines thus far, investiga tional regimens, and best 
supportive care. Given the morbidity associated with this disea se, there is an urgent need to 
identify novel therapies that improve the outcome of patients w ith recurrent GBM. 
1.3 Cancer Stem Cells and GBM 
CSCs or cancer cells with stemness phenotypes are a sub-populat ion of cancer cells that have 
self-renewal capability, are highly malignant, and are consider ed to be fundamentally 
responsible for malignant growth, recurrence, drug-resistance, and metastasis. Moreover, 
CSCs are highly resistant to chemotherapies and current targete d agents. CSCs have been 
isolated from almost all major tumour types, including GBM. In fact, one of the pioneering 
studies on solid tumor CSCs reported that CD133 marks GBM stem cells [Singh 2004] .
Targeting stem cells, therefore, holds great promise for fundam entally advancing cancer 
treatment, including that for GBM.
Accumulating evidence indicates that CSCs play a key role in bo th the initiation of GBM 
[Singh 2004]  and in tumor recurrence (in the latter via its role in chemora diotherapy 
resistance) [Chen 2012, Bao 2006, Beier 2008] . Cancer stem cells have been isolated from 
human GBM using cell surface markers such as Lgr5 [Nakata 2013, Mao 2013]  and CD133 
[Singh 2004, Brescia 2013] . CSCs isolated from GBM patients display both tumor-initiating  
properties and resistance to chemotherapeutics. These findings suggest that the development 
of cancer stem cell inhibitors represents a novel and compellin g strategy for the treatment of 
GBM.
1.4 Mechanism of Action 
STAT3 is aberrantly activated in a wide variety of human cancer s, including GBM, all of the 
major carcinomas, and in some hematologic tumors. STAT3 is a ke y transcription factor that 
is activated in 50-80% of GBM, is associated with advanced tumo r grade, is involved in 
resistance to TMZ, and is correlated with worse outcome in both  animal models of human 
GBM and in human patients, regardless of MGMT status [Carro 2010, Kohsaka 2012, 
Stechishin 2013, Lo 2008] . Importantly, STAT3 is the master transcription factor underly ing 
the mesenchymal subtype of human glioma [Dunn 2012; Phillips 2006; Carr 2010] .
Inhibition of STAT3 in vitro potentiates TMZ efficacy in TMZ-re sistant GBM cell lines and 
data suggest that STAT3 mediates MGMT expression [Kohsaka 2012] . These data 
demonstrate that both GBM pathogenesis and chemoradioresistance  may be regulated by 
STAT3 and therefore establish a powerful rationale for the deve lopment of GBM cancer 
therapies based on inhibition of STAT3 activity. 
1.5 Preclinical Efficacy 
Boston Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 15  Cancer stem cells are intrinsically resistant (more than 5 to 1 0  fold) to chemotherapeutic 
drugs. BBI608 has potent activity (~100 to 500 nM) against canc er stem cells in vitro and in 
vivo, and moreover spares normal hematopoietic stem cells (IC50 not  reached at 30 ʛM);
these properties offer a wide therapeutic window. The dependenc e on STAT3 for aberrant 
activity is conserved in various non-stem cancer cells. BBI608 has demonstrated in vitro 
efficacy against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines de rived from both solid tumors 
and hematologic malignancies (IC50 ~100 nM to 500 nM). BBI608 m onotherapy has 
demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in vivo , and in the absence of adverse effects, in 
multiple murine xenograft models of human cancer, including tho se of brain, liver, head and 
neck, breast, prostate, colon, gastric and pancreatic cancers. Additionally, in vivo 
spontaneous metastasis mouse models have demonstrated that BBI6 08 monotherapy has anti-
metastatic activity.  
When administered in mouse xenograft models, many chemotherapeu tic agents increase 
pSTAT3 levels and enrich cancer stem cell abundance.  BBI608 is  able to significantly 
decrease pSTAT3 levels as well as deplete stem cell abundance, and to block the induction of 
pSTAT3 and the increase in cancer stem cells by chemotherapeutic  agents. In vitro , treatment 
of GBM cell lines with BBI608 in combination with TMZ results i n potent and synergistic 
spherogenesis inhibition. Additionally, combined treatment with  BBI608 and TMZ
suppresses levels of p-STAT3 and E-catenin, while monotherapy with TMZ leads to up-
regulation of these proteins. These data suggest broad therapeu tic potential of BBI608 in 
human GBM. 
1.6 GLP Toxicology  
GLP 28-day repeat dose toxicology studies were performed in bot h rats and dogs at doses of 
10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day of BBI608 by oral gavage.   
In the rat study, 100 mg/kg was not tolerated by the male rats.  Toxic observations include 
significant weight loss, soft feces and diarrhea, and decreased  food consumption, which led 
to early sacrifice. These symptoms recovered in the remaining m ale rats within 14 days after     
termination of dosing. Female rats receiving 100 mg/kg/day show ed weight loss during the 
first week of dosing; however, weight recovered during the cont inued dosing phase without 
significant abnormal clinical observations.  
In the rat study, abnormal laboratory findings (azotemia, hypon atremia, hypochloremia, 
hyperkalemia, polycythemia, neutrophilia, monocytosis, and lymp hopenia) were observed 
primarily in moribund male rats dosed at 100 mg/kg. These findi ngs are consistent with acute 
renal failure in the setting of dehydration and diarrhea. In ra ts dosed at 100 mg/kg for 28 
days, there was a mild decrease in sodium, chloride, and albumin levels and mild elevation of 
white blood cells, red blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes an d monocytes. No significant 
abnormal laboratory findings were seen in recovered rats, sugge sting that these abnormal 
laboratory findings are reversible. There were no abnormal labo ratory findings in rats dosed 
at 10 and 30 mg/kg.  
In the rat study, histopathological findings were noted in the rats dosed at 100 mg/kg, 
primarily in moribund male rats, including microscopic changes in the stomach and urinary 
bladder (focal or multifocal c hronic ulceration, epithelial hyp erplasia, chronic active

BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 16  inflammation or hemorrhagic changes), in lymphoid tissues (mild  to marked lymphoid 
atrophy with mild to moderate lymphocyte apoptosis in thymus, m ild to moderate lymphoid 
atrophy and mild to moderate mastocytosis in mesenteric lymph n odes, mild to moderate 
lymphoid atrophy in two moribund male rats dosed at 100 mg/kg, and some elevation of 
hemosiderosis in the spleen) and in adrenal glands (mild cortic al vacuolation). These findings 
were considered to be non-specific changes related to the test vehicle in the setting of 
dehydration and diarrhea. There were no significant histopathol ogical findings in recovered 
rats, suggesting that these histopathological changes are rever sible. There was no significant 
test vehicle related microscopic changes in rats dosed at 30 mg /kg and at 10 mg/kg.  
In the rat study, toxicokinetics showed that all dose groups in  rats achieved BBI608 exposure 
at a level well above the predicted exposure levels needed for efficacy, and exposure lasted 
beyond 10 hours.  
In the dog study, toxicity was observed in dogs receiving 100 m g/kg/day.  Toxic symptoms 
consisted of mild weight loss, emesis, diarrhea, and mucoid and  soft feces. These adverse 
effects were reversible within 14 days in the setting of contin ued dosing. No treatment-
related clinical pathological, gross pathological, or histopath ological effects were observed at 
any dose level. All dose groups achieved plasma levels of BBI60 8 above the predicted levels 
needed for efficacy, and exposure lasted beyond 10 hours.  
The no observable adverse effect level  (NOAEL, based on clinical observation, laboratory 
tests, gross and histopathological changes) for rats administer ed BBI608 daily orally over 28 
days was 30 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 180 mg/m2) and th e NOAEL in dogs 
administered BBI608 daily orally over 28 days was 30 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 
600 mg/m2). 
1.7 Safety and Encouraging Signs of Antitumor Activity in Phase I and II Studies 
In the Phase I dose escalation study of BBI608 monotherapy, 14 cohorts (N=41) were dosed 
from 20 mg to 2000 mg/day.  All of the patients in this study w ere in the last line of 
treatment setting. Eighteen (44%) of the patients had CRC, whic h was the most common type 
of cancer studied in this trial. Other types of cancers varied from 2-7% of the total, and 
included gastric/GEJ, pancreatic, NSCLC, prostate, head and nec k, melanoma and others.  
The vast majority of the patients (78%) in this study had progr essed on >3 prior regimens. 
Adverse events were generally mild, including grade 1-2 diarrhe a, nausea, anorexia and 
fatigue with a total of 4 grade 3 events (diarrhea and fatigue) . MTD was not reached. At 400 
mg/day, the plasma concentration of BBI608 was sustained at a c oncentration > 1.5 uM 
(several fold above the IC 50 [avg.~0.09 uM]) for >8 hours.  RP2D has been determined to be 
480 mg bid. Among those evaluable for tumor response (using REC IST 1.1 criteria), disease 
control (disease stabilization and regression) was observed in 65% of patients. Prolonged 
time to progression was observed in 46% of evaluable patients, including patients with CRC, 
head & neck, gastric, ovarian, melanoma, and breast cancers. In  the subset of patients with 
CRC (N=18), disease control was seen in 67% of those evaluable.   Median progression free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 14 and 47 weeks, re spectively, were observed in 
evaluable CRC patients.  Median OS for biomarker-positive (nucl ear E-catenin and high p-
STAT3) CRC patients was 53 weeks and 54 weeks, respectively.  I n this study, BBI608 has 
shown a favorable safety and PK profile, and encouraging signs of activity, particularly in 
CRC.  
Boston Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 17  In addition, BBI608 has been evaluated in combination therapy i n the Phase Ib/II studies. 
BBI608 has been safely combined at full dose with paclitaxel or  capecitabine (BBI608-201 
and BBI608-224, respectively), with a similar adverse event pro file compared to that of 
either BBI608 or paclitaxel monotherapy. The RP2D of BBI608 in combination with weekly 
paclitaxel or capecitabine has  been determined to be 480 mg twi ce daily.  
In a previously conducted subcohort of BBI608-201 with Budesoni de prophylaxis for GI 
symptoms, budesonide an oral topical corticosteroid led to mark ed decrease in the incidence 
and severity of gastrointestina l symptoms.  Budesonide decrease d the incidence and severity 
of diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue in pa tients who received oral 
Budesonide 9mg po QD when combined with BBI608 at 480mg either as monotherapy or 
combined with weekly Paclitaxel and at 240mg either as monother apy or combined with 
weekly Paclitaxel.  Plasma levels of BBI608 in subjects taking budesonide were similar to 
the ones that had not received budesonide prophylaxis at BBI608  doses of 240mg and 480mg 
bid, either with or without the addition of weekly Paclitaxel i nfusion. 
Given the clinical data thus far, and the encouraging in vitro  and in vivo  results seen with the 
combination of BBI608 with TMZ, further evaluation of BBI608 in  combination therapy to 
treat GBM is warranted.

Confidential Page 21  4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design 
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase Ib/II, study of BBI60 8 administered in combination 
with TMZ to patients with recurrent or progressive GBM who have  not received prior 
bevacizumab therapy. The study is designed to explore the safet y, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics of BBI608, and the preliminary anti-cancer act ivity of BBI608 in 
combination with TMZ, in adults with recurrent or progressive G BM who have not received 
prior treatment with bevacizumab and who may or may not be elig ible for further surgical 
resection. The primary efficacy endpoint will be PFS-6. Seconda ry efficacy endpoints will 
include median PFS, OS, DCR and ORR.  
Arm A  will include patients who are candidates for repeat surgical r esection. These patients 
will receive 7 (±2) days of BBI608 monotherapy at a dose level o f 480 mg twice daily (960 
mg total daily dose – Initial Dose) prior to resection. Following surgical clinical recovery, 
and on a date between 15-28 days following the date of surgery,  BBI608 (480 mg twice 
daily) will be restarted in combination with TMZ (150 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5 of each 
28-day cycle). If a patient does not recover from surgical rese ction sufficiently within 28 
days to resume oral therapy with BBI608 plus TMZ, the patient s hould be withdrawn from 
study. Combination therapy will continue until disease progress ion or another 
discontinuation criterion is met.  The dose of TMZ can be incre ased to 200 mg/m2 for those 
patients who complete at least one cycle at 150 mg/m2in combination with BBI608.   
Arm B  will include patients who are either not candidates for repeat  surgical resection or 
have undergone repeat surgical resection prior to enter the stu dy. These patients will receive 
BBI608 (480 mg twice daily) in combination with TMZ (150 mg/m2 administered for days 1 
through 5 of each 28 day cycle) and continue treatment until dis ease progression or another 
discontinuation criterion is met. The dose of TMZ can be increa sed to 200 mg/m2 for those 
patients who complete at least one cycle at 150 mg/m2 in combin ation with BBI608.   
Initially, 6 patients will be enrolled into a safety cohort for  each study arm. The 6-patient 
safety cohort will be evaluated for the occurrence of DLTs duri ng the first 28 days of 
combination treatment. For patient in Arm A during the run-in pe riod with BBI608 
monotherapy, the same DLT rules as for the combination therapy will apply.  Enrollment will 
be held if ≥ 2 patients are unable to undergo resection due to DLTs.  Enrollment will also be 
held if ≥ 2 patients have an unexpected surgical complication.
For a given arm, if > 2 out of 6 patients experience a DLT, then  the BBI608 dose will be 
reduced for all patients in that arm to the next lower dose leve l of 240mg twice daily. 
Furthermore, an additional 6-patient safety cohort in that stud y arm will be enrolled at the
reduced dose-level and evaluate d for DLT as described below.  
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) will be defined as the dose-lev el evaluated at which < 1
of 6 patients per cohort experiences a DLT.  
An additional 24 patients may be enrolled at RP2D in each arm. For both study arms, cycle length will be 28 days. Combination- therapy cycles will consist of 
BBI608 administration daily for 28 days and TMZ administration o n days 1-5 of each cycle.

therapy .
4.2 Rationale for Study Design  
Considerable data has been collected from the Phase I monothera py study of BBI608 as well 
as from phase 1b/II studies conducted in advanced oncology pati ents who have failed 
multiple previous regimens. BBI608 has shown a favorable safety  and PK profile and 
encouraging signs of activity. Combination of cancer stem cell therapeutics with 
chemotherapy would allow simultaneous inhibition of cancer stem  cells as well as non-stem 
tumor bulk cells. Given the clinical data thus far, and the enc ouraging in vitro  and in vivo
results seen with combination of BBI608 with TMZ, further evalu ation of BBI608 in 
combination therapy to treat GBM is warranted. 
4.3 Selection of Dose 
Dose escalation for BBI608 has be en successfully conducted from  20 to 2000 mg total daily 
dose. MTD was not reached and RP2 D was determined based on phar macokinetics. Adverse 
events observed in the BBl608 monotherapy phase I trial have be en generally mild (Grade 1-
2) with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, anorexia and fa tigue.  Grade 3 events 
include fatigue and diarrhea. No bone marrow suppression or neu ropathy was observed. 
In phase 1b/II studies, BBI608 has been successfully combined a t full dose (480 mg twice 
daily) with weekly paclitaxel or capecitabine, without any sign s of adverse effects that differ 
from those that occur when either agent is administered as monot herapy.  
Dosing of BBI608 in each combination arm of this trial will be initiated at 480 mg twice 
daily; this dose is the monotherapy RP2D for BBI608 and is also  the RP2D of BBI608 in 
combination with weekly paclitaxel or capecitabine.

period starts from the first administration of TMZ), or having h ad a protocol-defined DLT at 
any time within this period. Based on the tolerability and safe ty of evaluable patients, 
enrollment of additional patients  will occur according to crite ria described below:  
xIf <1 treated patients experien ce a BBI608-related DLT (defined  below) by Day 28 of 
Cycle 1 of combination therapy with TMZ, then additional patien ts will be enrolled at 
this BBI608 dose into the RP2D expansion cohort.
xIf >2 treated patients at a dose level experience a BBI608-rela ted DLT by Day 28 of 
Cycle 1, patient enrollment into this BBI608 dose level cohort will stop and the 
BBI608 dose will be reduced to the next lower  dose level of 24 0mg twice daily. An
additional 6-patient safety cohort will be enrolled at the redu ced dose-level and 
evaluated for DLT.  
xRP2D of BBI608 with TMZ will be defined as the dose level at wh ich no more than 
one patient with DLT is observed among six patients.
The BBI medical Monitor and Principal Investigator will review all significant BBI608-
related toxicities to determine whether the initial BBI608 dose  (480 mg twice daily) requires 
adjustment.  Lower BBI608 doses may be assigned after agreement  between the BBI Medical 
Monitor and the Principal Investigator.  
4.5 Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
A DLT is defined by the occurrence of any of the following toxi cities possibly, probably or 
definitely related to BBI608 or BBI608 in combination with TMZ during the first 28 days of 
combination treatment: 
xCTCAE Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant blee ding 
xCTCAE Grade 4 hematological toxicity.  
xCTCAE Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity, except: 
oGrade 3 nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea or fatigue that pe rsist <7 days 
with appropriate supportive care. 
xCTCAE Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity
oBecause DVT and PE are common complications among GBM patients,  the 
first occurrence of DVT or PE will not be considered a DLT.  
xToxicities leading to delay of study treatment for ≥ 14 days
xDuring the post-surgical period and prior to initiation of comb ination therapy with 
BBI608 and TMZ, any grade 3 or greater hematological or non-hem atological 
toxicity that cannot be attributed to the surgical procedure or  to typical post-operative 
complications 
xAny other toxicity that in the view of the Principal Investigat or represents a clinically 
significant hazard to the patient  
Boston Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 24  Whether a DLT has occurred will be assessed during the 28 days of the first cycle of 
combination treatment with TMZ and during the run in and post-o perative period of Arm A.  
DLT will be determined from adverse events and changes from bas eline in physical 
examination findings and in laboratory parameters. 
To be considered evaluable for DLT, compliance with the assigne d dose of BBI608 and 
TMZ must be ≥ 80%.  Patients who do not complete 28 days of combination therapy fo r 
reasons other than DLT or patients who are not eligible for DLT  assessment may be replaced.  
Adverse events considered related to TMZ only will not be consi dered DLTs for BBI608 in 
combination with TMZ.   
4.6 Study Duration  
Patients will receive treatment with BBI608 until progression o f disease (clinical or 
radiological), unacceptable toxicit y, or another discontinuatio n criterion is documented (see 
Section 5.7).   
5 STUDY VISITS 
5.1 Overview 
Study Visits will consist of a Pre-Study Evaluation, during whi ch the patient is evaluated to 
determine suitability for entry i nto the study; On-Treatment Ev aluations, during which the 
patient is regularly evaluated during the conduct of the study;  and an End-of-Study 
Evaluation (See APPENDIX A and APPENDIX B for schedules of Asse ssments). 
Following the Pre-Study Evaluation and a determination by a Pri ncipal Investigator that the 
patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and after the p atient signs the informed consent, 
the patient will be considered enrolled in the study.   
In general, unless otherwise noted, a window of ± 2 days is all owed when scheduling 
protocol visits and evaluations.  If, due to unforeseen circums tances, frame-shifting of a 
study cycle or patient visit schedule occurs beyond the allowab le window of ± 2 days, the 
medical monitor for the Sponsor should be notified of the alter nate schedule.  The protocol 
window of ± 2 days may then be applied to the frame-shifted sch edule.   
Unscheduled clinical assessments during a study cycle are allow ed, but should not replace a 
per-protocol study visit unless it is within the ± 2 day window .   
5.2 Informed Consent 
Patients who agree to participate will sign the approved inform ed consent and will be 
provided a copy of the signed document.   
Boston Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017

5.5 Tumor Evaluation Visits 
For patients in Arm A, an MRI will be performed within 48-72 ho urs of surgery and will be 
used as the baseline exam for the purposes of tumor response ev aluation in the patients who 
undergo surgical resection. 
In both study arms, disease status and tumor response will be a ssessed at eight-week intervals 
until objective disease progression, or as clinically indicated , beginning approximately 8 
weeks following initiation of combination therapy with BBI608 a nd TMZ.  Standard imaging 
studies will be performed accordi ng to institutional procedures .  Tumor response will be 
evaluated using the guidelines for Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (RANO)
Working Group criteria outlined in Section 9, and study Case Report Forms (CRFs) will 
include relevant lesion measurements as determined by the study  site. De-identified 
radiologic image dictation report as well as de-identified copi es of the radiologic images for 
independent review may be requested in cases where radiologic a ssessment is in question.    
Once clinical or radiological progression of disease during BBI 608 therapy is documented, 
patients may continue treatme nt with BBI608 at the discretion o f their treating physician. 
5.6 End of Study Evaluation 
All patients will be followed 14-30 days after the last dose of  B B I 6 0 8 .   I f  a  p a t i e n t  i s  
removed from the study due to drug-related adverse events, the patient will be followed to 
evaluate any drug-related AEs that occurred either during the s tudy or within 30 days of the 
last BBI608 dose.  The patient will be followed until resolutio n of the AE or for 30 days, 
whichever is longer.  In the presence of toxic effects, follow- up visits will be required every 
four weeks until all study related toxicities have resolved to baseline (or < CTCAE Grade 1), 
have stabilized, or are deemed irreversible.   
The following assessments will be made during the End of Study visit: 
xPhysical examination including a neurological examination  
xECOG performance status score 
xVital signs  (weight, temperature, blood pressure, respiration and pulse)

After BBI608 administration is dis continued and after the EOS s tudy visit has been 
completed, patients will be followed for important information and the occurrence of 
specified clinical endpoints: PFS and OS.  There are no further  visits required specifically for 
this study once the EOS visit has taken place.   
The clinical parameters and endpoints for follow-up are specifi ed below .  The intent is that 
the follow-up and collection of this information is accomplishe d through review of the local

xWithdrawal of consent 
xInvestigator decision 
xLost to Follow-up 
xDeath  
xClinically unacceptable toxicities despite optimal treatment or  dose reduction 
xPregnancy 
*RANO criteria serve to categorize clinical radiologic images.  Given a unique mechanism of 
action targeting cancer stem cells, BBI608 therapy may be conti nued in a patient who is 
clinically well, but who meets criteria for “Progressed Disease” per RANO criteria.  
Continuation of BBI608 protocol therapy in this context is allo wed provided no further 
standard, approved treatment options exist; and provided the in vestigator assess that the 
potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk a nd in the absence of intolerable 
toxicities, performance status decline, worsening of disease re lated symptoms, radiological 
findings that would warrant acute intervention and no ongoing s evere toxicities that may be 
related to BBI608.  The patient will also get repeat tumor asse ssments after 4-6 weeks.  
Treatment with BBI608 (with or without TMZ) will continue until  unacceptable toxicity, 
further disease progression (clinical or radiological), or anot her discontinuation criterion is 
met.
5.7.1 Dates Associated with Discontinuation from Study 
The following clarifies important dates at the end of study tre atment: 
Date of Last Dose: The date th at the last dose of BBI608 is taken.  The Date of Last 
Dose does not necessarily need to be the Date Off Active Study.
Date Off Active Study: The date when both the patient and the investigator/study team 
understand the patient to be off of active protocol treatment.  I n  
most cases, this will be the same as the Date of Last Dose ;
however, it does not need to be the case.  In addition, the Date Off 
Active Study may not coincide with a formal study visit.  
End of Study Visit: A formal study visit held 30 days after the Date of Last Dose .

6.5 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Pre-clinical and clinical studies conducted by BBI have identif ied several biomarkers in 
tumor tissues whose levels either increase or decrease upon exp osure to BBI608.  Archival 
tumor samples will be collected from patients in both study arm s. On-study tumor samples 
following 1 week of treatment with BBI608 monotherapy prior to surgical resection will be 
collected ONLY from patients enrolled into Arm A, as described below. The goal of the 
proposed biomarker study is to examine the response of biomarke rs in patients treated with 
BBI608 monotherapy. Subject tumor samples will be processed for  determination of 
pharmacodynamic markers in malignant tissue by histopathology a nd cancer stem cell (CSC) 
assays.

Confidential Page 34  6.6 Archival and On-Study Tumor Tissue Collection  
Archival formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples  from a previous resection 
or biopsy of the patient’s glioblastoma  should be collected from all patients enrolled in the 
clinical trial. 
For patients enrolled into Arm A, the archival tumor tissue wil l serve as a baseline  sample 
prior to starting treatment with BBI608.  An on-treatment  tumor sample will be collected 
during the surgical tumor resection, following completion of th e 1-week BBI608 
monotherapy treatment.  
Tumor samples that are obtained at the time of surgical resecti on and are labeled with study 
protocol identification number and patient identification numbe r will be sent to a regulatory 
authority-approved tumor bank affiliated with the study site, o r to the study site pathology 
department if the site does not have a regulatory authority-app roved tumor bank. 
Appropriately processed tumor specimens would be then forwarded  to the Sponsor or 
Sponsor CRO for analysis. Processing of all tumor tissue will i nclude creation of both fresh 
frozen samples for PK analysis as well as blocks of formalin fi xed paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE) samples for PD analysis.  
Collection, storage, and shipping of tissue samples will be per formed as described in the 
accompanying Laboratory Manual.  
Other investigations on tumor samples may be performed as deter mined by the study 
investigators and/or study sponsors.  If the patient grants per mission, tumor samples may be 
stored for additional future studies.   
Please see the Laboratory Manual for this study for more inform ation regarding collection, 
processing, storage and shipment of tumor sample tissue.

7.1.2 BBI608 Administration 
BBI608 will be administered continuously by mouth twice daily, with doses approximately 
12 hours apart.  BBI608 should be administered approximately on e hour prior to or two hours 
after meals, and the first dos e should be given in the morning.    
The dose of BBI608 to be administered depends on the dose level  to which the patient is 
enrolled.  See Section 4.1 for details. 
7.1.3 Temozolomide (TMZ) Administration 
Detailed instructions for the preparation, premedication, and a dministration of TMZ are 
provided in the Product Labels approved by Health Canada or US FDA. Temozolomide is a 
standard of care medication and will not be provided by the Spo nsor. 
TMZ 150 mg/m2 will be administered orally to patients enrolled into arms A a nd B, 
beginning on Day1 of Cycle 1 of combination treatment.  TMZ wil l be administered on days 
1 through 5 of each 28-day combination therapy cycle. In case o f toxicity, dose adjustment is 
permitted. If TMZ is tolerated at the 150 mg/m2 once daily dose, dosage may be increased to 
200 mg/m2once daily dose after the first cycle. 
A 3 hour interval between the first daily dose of BBI608 and th e initiation of TMZ is 
required on PK days (i.e. C1D1 and C1D5) during Cycle 1 only, i n order to standardize PK 
interpretation. On all other days, the first daily administrati on of BBI608 should precede the 
administration of TMZ by 0-4 hours. 
7.2 Dose Modifications 
7.2.1 BBI608 
For any suspected BBI608-related grade 3 or intolerable grade 2  adverse events that persist 
despite optimized medical management (see Table 1), a dose holid ay of 0.5-3 days followed 
by dose modification as outlined in the table below is recommen ded. Investigators should

be recorded on the appropriate CRF. 
7.6 Concomitant Medication 
7.6.1 Permitted Treatment 
All information regarding concomitant treatments (medications o r procedures) must be 
recorded o n the patient’s CRF (including the name of the medication or procedure and 
duration of treatment).  
Concurrent corticosteroid administration is permitted as specif ied in the inclusion criteria. 
Any corticosteroid administration must be recorded on the pati ent’s CRF.  Steroid dosing will 
be adjusted as clinically appropriate during therapy.
Palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms wil l be offered to all patients in

BBI608 was shown in vitro to inhibit individual CYP P450 isoforms 1A2, 2D6, 2C19, 3A4, 
and 2C9 with IC50’s of 0.25 μM, 0.25 μM, 2.5 μM, 5 μM, and 0.5 μM respectively, under 
serum-free conditions. Since BBI608 has shown the ability to in hibit these CYP P450 
isoforms in vitro , concomitant use of agents that are substrates of these CYP P4 50 enzymes 
should be used only if deemed medically necessary by the primar y investigator. Examples of 
commonly prescribed agents that are metabolized by these CYP P4 50 enzymes are: 
  NSAIDS: such as ibuprofen, naproxen 
Proton pump inhibitors: such as lansoprazole, omeprazole  
Oral hypoglycemic medications: sulfonylureas  Beta-blockers: metoprolol, carvedilol  Calcium channel blockers: amlodi pine, diltiazem, nefedipine, ve rapamil  
Antidepressants: paroxetine, i mipramine, amitriptyline  
Anti-epileptics: such as phenytoin, phenobarbitone  
Anti-psychotics: such as haloperidol, risperidone  
Antibiotics: such as clarithromycin, erythromycin

Confidential Page 41  HMG CoA reductase inhibitor: a torvastatin, lovastatin, simvasta tin  
Anesthetics: such as halothane, enflurane; HIV antivirals: such as saqui navir, indinavir, ritonavir  
Immunomodulators (immunosuppressives): such as cyclosporine, ta crolimus 
Steroids: such as hydrocortisone, estrodiol 
BBI608 is metabolized by the CYP P450 isoform 1A2. Therefore, c oncomitant use of drugs 
that inhibit or induce CYP1A2 should be avoided unless deemed m edically necessary by the 
primary investigator.   
Known drugs that inhibit CYP 1A2 include ciprofloxacin and othe r fluoroquinolones, 
Fluvoxamine Verapamil, amiodarone, interferon, methoxsalen, eno xacin, mexiletine, and 
ticlopidine.
Several common anti-epileptic drugs are known to induce CYP1A2 including 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. These enzyme-induci ng anti-epileptics 
(EIAEDs) should be avoided with concomitant BBI608 treatment, a nd a non-AEID 
alternative anti-convulsa nt should be used instead. 
Of note, no clinically apparent drug-drug interactions occurred  during phase I or phase Ib/II
studies conducted with BBI608 thus far. 
In addition, the following treatments are allowed: 
xStandard therapies for conc urrent medical conditions 
xEpoetin alfa (Epogen
®, Procrit®)
xHematopoietic growth factors, including filgrastim (Neupogen®), or other granulocyte 
colony stimulating factors (G-CSF), are permitted following doc umented and 
clinically significant neutropenia after the patient has comple ted at least one cycle of 
treatment with BBI608 
xProphylactic antiemetics may be administered according to stand ard practice  
xLow dose corticosteroids use d as an antiemetic regimen 
xMegestrol ace tate (Megace®)
7.6.2 Budesonide - Interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant oral administration of ketoconazole (a known inhibi tor of CYP3A4 activity in 
the liver and in the intestinal mucosa) caused an eight-fold in crease of the systemic exposure 
to oral budesonide. If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 acti vity (such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin) i s indicated, discontinuation of 
budesonide should be considered. After extensive intake of grap efruit juice (which inhibits 
CYP3A4 activity predominantly in the intestinal mucosa), the sy stemic exposure for oral 
budesonide increased about two times. Ingestion of grapefruit o r grapefruit juice should be 
avoided in connection with budesonide administration.

8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Adverse Events  
8.1.1 Assessments 
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of pa tients who have enrolled in the 
study. All AEs considered to be r elated to BBI608 occurring aft er any administration of the 
study drug will be followed until the event resolves. AEs will be evaluated using the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE, Version 4.0.
Investigators are required to document all AEs occurring during  the clinical trial, 
commencing with study enrollment and including the protocol-def ined post-treatment 
follow-up period (21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] §312.64[ b]) on designated CRF 
pages. It is also important to record all AEs that result in pe rmanent discontinuation of the 
investigational product being studied, whether serious or non-s erious. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs), as defined below, must be report ed to Boston Biomedical or 
its representative within 24 hours of knowledge of their occurr ence. 
8.1.2 Definitions 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurr ence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject that does not necessarily have a causal r elationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (inc luding an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to  the medicinal product. 
Laboratory data are to be collected as stipulated in this proto col, and toxicity trends will be 
analyzed utilizing objective toxicity criteria.  Clinical syndr omes associated with laboratory 
abnormalities are to be recorded as appropriate (e.g., diabetes  mellitus instead of 
hyperglycemia).   
Progression of disease is considered an efficacy outcome parame ter and should not be 
captured as an AE.  A non-serious AE is any untoward medical oc currence that does not 
meet any of the criteria for SAEs as defined below. 
Patients should be instructed to report any AE that they experi ence to the Investigator.  
Investigators should assess the patient for AEs at each visit.  AEs occurring during the 
clinical trial and the follow-up period should be recorded on t he appropriate AE CRF.  To

BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 43  capture the most potentially relevant safety information during  a clinical trial, it is important 
that investigators record accurate AE terms on CRFs. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the investigator and recorded on the CRF.  However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a compon ent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the investigator, it should be recorded as a separa te AE on the CRF. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
8.2.1 Definitions 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event occurring at  any dose that results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
xDeath 
xA life-threatening adverse drug experience 
xInpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitali zation   
xA persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events may be considered an SAE based upon ap propriate medical 
judgment.   
Under this protocol, scheduled hospitalizations or elective sur gical/medical procedures or 
elective hospitalization will not be considered SAEs.  Prolonga tion of a scheduled 
hospitalization can be considered an SAE.  Complications associ ated with scheduled 
procedures are considered an AE. 
8.2.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE, including death, due to any cause that occurs during t his investigation, whether or 
not related to the administration of study drug, must be report ed to the Sponsor immediately 
(not to exceed 24 hours) by telephone, secured email or facsimi l e .   T h e  r e a c t i o n  m u s t  b e

Confidential Page 44  9 ASSESSMENT OF ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY 
The following definitions and criteria (from Response Assessmen t in Neuro-Oncology 
[RANO Wen et al., 2010] Working Group criteria) should be used for the baseline 
evaluations of existing disease, and for the ongoing evaluation  of tumor responses. 
Measurable disease - presence of at least one measurable lesion.  
Measurable lesions  - lesions that are bidimensionally contrast-enhancing with cle arly 
defined margins by CT or MRI scan, with two perpendicular diame ters of at least 10 mm, 
visible on two or more axial slices that are preferably, at mos t, 5 mm apart with 0-mm skip. 
The size of a measurable lesion at baseline should be two times  the slice thickness. 
Non-measurable lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest perpendi cular 
diameters < 10 mm), unidimensionally measurable lesions, or mas ses with margins not 
clearly defined. 
xAll measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notatio n, using a 
ruler or calipers. 
xThe same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline an d during follow-
up.
xTumor surrounding a cyst or a surgical cavity should be conside red non-
measurable unless there is a nodular component measuring > 10 m m in 
diameter.  
9.1 Method of Measurement 
xMRI (T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images as well as T2-weighte d/FLAIR 
images) is the best currently available and reproducible method  to measure 
target lesions selected for res ponse assessment.  Conventional MRI should be 
performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness contiguo usly.   
xCT scan with contrast enhancement may be used for patients with  MRI non-
compatible devices. 
xAll imaging methods should be performed according to institutio nal standards 
with each patient having consistency of methods beginning from baseline 
through the course of the study. 
xIdeally patients should be imaged on the same MRI or CT (for pa tients with 
MRI non-compatible devices), or at least with the same magnet s trength, for 
the duration of the study to redu ce difficulties in interpretat ion of images. 
9.2 Baseline Documentation of “T arget” and “Non-Target” Lesions 
xIf there are multiple contrast-enhancing lesions, a minimum of two lesions up 
to a maximum of five lesions total should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline. 
Boston Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 45  xTarget lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (l esions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated m easurements 
(either by imaging techniques or clinical assessments). 
xOccasionally, the largest lesions may not allow reproducible re peated 
measurements, and the next largest lesions that can be measured  reproducibly 
should be selected. 
xA sum of the products of the perpendicular longest diameters (L D) for all 
target lesions  will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The 
baseline sum LD will be used as the reference by which to chara cterize the 
objective tumor response. 
xPatients with multiple lesions of which only 1 or 2 are increas ing in size, the 
enlarging lesions should be considered the target lesions  for evaluation of 
response. The other lesions will be considered non-target lesions  and should 
also be recorded.    
xThe cystic or surgical cavity should not be measured for respon se 
determination. 
xAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as  non-target lesions
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these  lesions are 
not required, but the presence or absence of each should be not ed throughout 
follow-up.
9.3 Response Criteria 
Radiographic response should be determined in comparison to the  tumor measurement 
obtained at pretreatment baseline for determination of response , and the smallest tumor 
measurement at either pretreatment baseline or after initiation  of therapy for determination of 
progression. For patients in Arm A who undergo surgical resecti on, the post-operative 
baseline scan (performed 48- 72 hours after surgery) should be u sed for response assessment. 
Response criteria are outlined below. In the event that the rad iographic changes are equivocal 
and it is unclear whether the patient is stable or has develope d progressive disease, it is 
permissible to continue treatment and observe the patient close ly, for example at 4-week 
intervals. If subsequent imaging studies demonstrate that progr ession has occurred, the date 
of progression should be the date of the scan at which progress ion was first suspected.  
Complete Response* 
Requires ALL of the following: 
1. Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-me asurable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks. 
2. No new lesions. 3. Stable or improved non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions. 4. Patients must be off corticos teroids (or on physiologic repla cement doses only). 
5. Patients must be stable or improved clinically.

Requires ALL of the following: 
1. Does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression. 
2. Stable non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR)  lesions on same or lower dose  of corticosteroids 
compared to baseline scan. IN the event that the corticosteroid  dose was increased for 
new symptoms and signs without confirmation of disease progress ion on 
neuroimaging, and subsequent follow-up imaging shows that this increase in 
corticosteroids was required be cause of disease progression, th e last scan considered 
to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corti costeroid use was 
equivalent to the baseline dose. 
3. Patients must be stable clinically.#
Progressive Disease 
Defined by ANY of the following: 
1. Greater than 25% increase in the sum of the products of perpe ndicular diameters of 
enhancing lesions compared to the smallest tumor measurement ob tained either at 
baseline (if no decrease) or be st response, on stable or increa sing doses of 
corticosteroids.** 
2. Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stab le or increasing doses 
of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response f ollowing initiation of 
therapy,* not due to co-morbid events (e.g. radiation therapy, demyelination, 
ischemic injury, infection, seizures, post-operative changes, o r other treatment 
effects).  
3. Any new lesion. 4. Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes  apart from the tumor (e.g. 
seizures, medication side effects, complications of therapy, ce rebrovascular events, 
infection, etc.) or changes in corticosteroid dose.
#
5. Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deterioratin g condition. 
6. Unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease. 
*Patients with non-measurable disease only cannot have a comple te or partial response. The 
best response possible is stable disease. 
**Stable doses of corticosteroids include patients not on corti costeroids.

Categorical variables will be su mmarized as the number and perc entage of patients in each 
category. Continuous variables will be summarized by the mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. 
The primary population for the effi cacy endpoints will be the P er Protocol population defined 
as the population of patients who have been treated with at lea st 80% of 1 complete cycle of
BBI608 and TMZ. Analyses will also be performed on   the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population 
in each arm. The primary endpoint is PFS-6, defined as the prop ortion of patients with PFS 
(i.e. absence of documented objective progression or death) at 6 months after enrollment.   
For each of the study arms, the secondary endpoints will includ e OS, defined as the interval 
between the date of patient enrollment until death; PFS, define d as the interval between the 
date of patient enrollment and objective disease progression or  death; ORR, the proportion of 
patients with a documented complete response or partial respons e according to the RANO 
criteria; and DCR, the proportion of patients with a documented  stable disease, partial 
response or complete response according to RANO criteria. 
10.2 Determination of Sample Size 
For each of the study arms, with the a sample size of 30, the l ower bound of the two-sided 
80% confidence interval, as estimated by the exact binomial met hod using a projected PFS-6 
of 20%, will be greater than 10%, and provides meaningful infor mation for further clinical 
evaluation. 
10.3 Analysis Populations 
All patients receiving at least one dose of BBI608 will be cons idered evaluable for safety 
analysis.  Adverse event incidence rates will be described by t he frequency of adverse events, 
categorized by NCI CTCAE version 4.0.  Listings of laboratory t est results collected at 
baseline and during the study will be generated.  Descriptive s tatistics summarizing the 
changes in those laboratory tests over time will be presented. 
For each of the study arms, the primary population for the effi cacy endpoints will be the Per 
Protocol population defined as the population of patients who h ave been treated with at least 
80% of 1 complete cycle of BBI608 and TMZ. Analyses will also b e  p e r f o r m e d  o n    t h e  
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population in each arm. The primary endpo int is PFS-6, defined as the 
proportion of patients with PFS (i.e. absence of documented obj ective progression or death) 
at 6 months after enrollment.   
10.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Patient characteristics will include a summary of the following :

xBaseline disease characteristics 
xPre-existing conditions 
xPrior therapies 
xConcomitant medications and treatments 
xMGMT methylation status 
Other patient characteristics wil l be summarized as appropriate  
10.5 Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Timed blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis will  be performed on Days 1 
and 5 of Cycle 1 of combination treatment with BBI608 and TMZ f or Phase Ib/DLT cohort 
patients in each study arms. 
Timed blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis will  additionally be performed 
for patients who experience a dosing regimen modification.   
These sample collections will  be according to the parameters ou tlined in Sections 6.4, and the 
accompanying study Laboratory Manual.
Bioanalytical analysis of patient samples will be conducted at a centralized laboratory using 
GLP-validated assays.  Plasma con centrations will be summarized  by descriptive statistics, 
including mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, m inimum, maximum, and 
median.
Concentration profiles will be an alyzed by non-compartmental an d/or non-linear least 
squares regression using WinNonLin.  Pharmacokinetic parameters , including C max, volume 
of distribution, distribution half-life, terminal half-life, an d AUC will be evaluated.  
10.6 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed by physical examination, and laboratory  assessments.  Weekly 
laboratory testing is required during the first 2 cycles of Pha se Ib. Adverse events will be 
graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0.  The incidence of DLTs will be evaluated 
for in all patients enrolled into a safety cohort for each of t he study arms.  The incidence of 
adverse events will be evaluated for all patients. All patients  will be followed for adverse 
events for at least 30 days after the last dose of BBI608, or u ntil recovery from all study drug 
related adverse events.  
11 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
The study will be initiated and conducted under the sponsorship  of Boston Biomedical.  
Study drug, clinical supplies, and CRFs will be supplied by Bos ton Biomedical, or its 
representative.  Representatives of Boston Biomedical will moni tor the study to verify study 
data, medical records, and CRFs in accordance with current ICH GCPs and other applicable 
regulations and guidelines.

1 Introduction  
Study title: Clinical feasibility study, implantable tibial nerve stimulator (ITNS); ITNS -01.  
Study sponsor : Nine Continents Medical, Inc., 302 Alden Lane, Livermore, CA 94 550 USA.  
Study objectives:  To report feasibility  data for safety and effectiveness of the study device.  
Study device: Nine Continents Medical implantable tibial nerve stimulator (ITNS) model 9C -680 
with programmer model 9C -580. 
Intended use:  The study device is intended for treatment of the symptoms of overactive bladder 
(OAB), including urinary urge incontinence and significant symptoms of urgency -frequency 
alone or in combination, in patients who have failed or could not tolerate more conservative 
treatments.  
2 Study design  
Type of design: Single -arm longitudinal design with no implanted comparator.  
Study sites: Single site, in the United States.  
Number of subjects:  The investigator will implant a study device in each of 10 subjects, to permit 
gathering  meaningful data for evaluating study endpoints while constraining the number of 
subjects exposed to residual risks . This sample size conforms to FDA recommendations (FDA, 
2013 -10-01). 
Study duration:  One year total, comprising six months for enrolling and  implanting 10 subjects, 
and 26 weeks for follow -up. The follow -up period allows  for biological stabilization at the 
implant site and for assessing the effect of neuromodulation therapy on OAB symptoms.  
To minimize or avoid bias : This protocol specifies in clusion and exclusion criteria and 
standardized methods and timing for assessing variables . It requires standardized case report 
forms for recording variables, and it specifies methods for analyzing variables.  
2.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
The target po pulation is the population indicated for third -line therapy for OAB . To avoid 
exposing subjects to risks in the absence of any anticipated benefit, exclusion criteria are 
intended to prevent implantation in subjects for whom success is unlikely due to gene ral health 
issues. Any exclusion criterion disqualifies a subject from further participation in the study.  
Although this is a feasibility study, it uses the same inclusion and exclusion criteria planned for a 
pivotal study . The purpose is to gain experienc e evaluating potential subjects with these criteria 
and to select a study population representative of the intended target population.

2.2 Medicare beneficiaries  
Medicare beneficiaries with symptoms of overactive bladder could benefit from the device if it 
performs as intended.  Prevalence of overactive bladder is approximately 30 % in the general 
populat ion 65 to 74 years old  (Stewart, et al., 2003) . Therefore a significant percentage of the 
population eligible for Medicare due to age has symptoms of overactive bladder. The percentage 
of the population eligible for Medicare due to disability, who also have symptoms of overactive 
bladder, is not known.  Criteria in §2.1 exclude individuals eligible for Medicare due to ESRD 
but do not ex clude those eligible due to ALS.  
2.3 Endpoints  
A clinical feasibility study  is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to capture 
preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near -final or final device design to 
adequately plan an appropriate p ivotal study (FDA, 2013 -10-01). A feasibility study does not 
collect definitive evidence; consequently it does not require statistical hypotheses or classifying 
objectives and endpoints as primary or secondary.  
Section 5 on page  15 provides rationales for endpoints.  
Type  of endpoints  List of endpoints  
Safety  Incidence, severity, and relatedness of all adverse events and device 
deficiencies . 
Stability of neuromodulation pulse amplitude required to evoke 
paresthesia or muscle response (“threshold”) .

3.2 Study devices and equipment   
Summary description: The study device is a miniaturized implantable pulse generator with an 
integrated electrode lead. The pulse generator is powered by a primary (non -rechargeable) 
lithium cell. It can be programmed non -invasively by timed applications of an external magnet, 
or it can be programmed and interrogated non -invasively by external programmer  model 9C -580. 
Device manufacturer:  Nine Continents  Medical, Inc., 302 Alden Lane, Livermore, CA 94550 
USA.  
Device identification:  Model number 9C -680. 
Device traceability:  Each device has a unique serial number.  
Device purpose: The pulse generator automatically provides stimulation at a pulse pattern and 
frequency preset to match those of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), without 
requiring clinic visits for the patient to receive therapy.  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 9 of 19 
 Materials in contact with tissues or body fluids: Refer to the drawing below. The study device 
does not con tain medicinal products, human or animal tissues or their derivatives, or other 
biologically active substances.  
 
Training and experience needed to use the device: This is a prescription device for implantation 
by a physician. The investigator will complet e study and device training before using the device.  
Medical or surgical procedures involved: The miniaturized pulse generator is permanently 
implanted via a percutaneous procedure. The implant site is subcutaneous in the medial lower 
calf, distal to the gastrocnemius muscle. The electrode -lead integrated with the pulse generator is 
advanced distally from the same incision with a marketed implant kit. The study device provides 
electrical pulses to the posterior tibial nerve at a point approximately 5 centi meters proximal to 
the medial malleolus, which is the same location where PTNS is applied.  
Background for study: Refer to sponsor’s report of prior investigations R -00105 for a detailed 
list of verification and validation studies successfully completed for  ITNS model 9C -680 and 
programmer model 9C -580. Briefly, ITNS validation studies included sterile packaging, 
sterilization, biocompatibility, and a six -month animal study with eight ITNS implanted in four 
sheep. ITNS verification studies included electroma gnetic compatibility; electrical specifications, 
safety, and reliability; mechanical specifications, safety, and reliability; and device longevity and 
lithium cell integrity. Programmer verification studies included electromagnetic compatibility 
and electr ical safety. ITNS and programmer software were validated. Risk analysis included 
system -level functions, RF wireless technology, and cybersecurity.  
3.3 Subjects  
Point of enrollment: The investigator will enroll study subjects at approved investigational sites  
after completing an investigator’s agreement and receiving notification from the sponsor that the 
study has started.  

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 10 of 19 
 Concomitant medication: Medication to be used during the study is at the investigator’s 
discretion, however any change in medication with urinary effects or side effects after the 
screening visit must be recorded as a protocol deviation.  
Replacement of subjects : This study has inclusion and exclusion criteria (§2.1 on page 3) 
intended to ensure that subjects complete the protocol after they receive the study de vice. 
Consequently this protocol has no provision for replacement of subjects after implantation.  
Efforts to minimize missed visits and drop -outs: The sponsor or sponsor’s designee will monitor 
the investigation as described in its established monitoring procedure and will promptly inform 
the investigator concerning missing data or missed visits. The investigator will remind subjects 
of scheduled visits by telephone or by E mail, and will document at least three (3) efforts to 
contact subjects who miss a visit (e.g. via registered mail, E mail, or telephone) . If a patient 
cannot be contacted, this becomes a withdrawal or discontinuation . 
Incentives for  subjects : The investigator  may provide special incentives to subjects for study  
compliance, but the compensation may not be so large as to unduly encourage the subjects to 
participate.  
Withdrawal or discontinuation : A subject may withdraw from the study at any time, for any 
reason, and without stating a reason.  Withdrawal or disconti nuation will not prejudice a subject’s 
future medical care by the investigation team or investigation site. Upon withdrawal or 
discontinuation a subject will have their ITNS explanted. An investigator may discontinue a 
subject’s participation for any of th e reasons below:  
 Any unanticipated adverse device effect ( see adverse event CRF ) which is, in the opinion 
of the investigator, related to the treatment and will endanger the well -being of the patient 
if treatment is continued;  
 Development of any concurren t illness, infection, or condition that might interfere with 
the investigation;  
 Non-compliance with the clinical investigation procedures deemed by the investigator to 
be sufficient to cause discontinuation; or  
 Any other problem deemed by the investigator  to be sufficient to cause discontinuation.  
Follow -up care:  Subjects who do not qualify as responders at the 26 -week visit will have their 
ITNS explanted. The investigator will provide medical care for the subjects after the clinical 
investigation has bee n completed, conforming to their standard practice.  
3.4 Procedure t iming  requirements  
Informed consent  must be signed befo re a subject undergoes any test or procedure  not required 
for routine  care outside the study. For example, the following tests may be performed before 
signed informed consent, provided they are necessary for a patient’ s routine  care: blood and 
urine analyses, physical examination, urodynamic s, cystoscopy, and pre -therapy diary. The study 
device must never  be used without prior signed in formed consent.  The investigator or an 
individual they designate must meet with each prospective subject to explain the study and 
alternatives  before requesting consent.  
The pre-therapy diary  provides a baseline for calculating symptom improvement after 
implantation of  the study device, consequently any improvement  of OAB symptoms in the pre -
therapy diary due to prior therapy and medications could mask the effectiveness of the study 
device. Investigational sites may use the study’s pre-therapy diary  form for routine care  outside 
the study . However, any pre -therapy diary used for the study must start : 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 11 of 19 
 1. At least 4 weeks after the most recent : 
 Use of any anti -muscarinics, beta -3 adrenergic agonists, or other OAB medications;  
 Dose change of any other medications with urinary side effects (e.g. Flomax, tri -
cyclic antidepressants, diuretics);  or 
 TENS use (back, pelvic, or legs).  
2. After sufficient time for symptoms to return to baseline levels of after stopping PTNS or 
Botox for OAB . Thi s time varies from subject to subject . 
When completing the  pre-screening , screening , and pre-implantation case report form s, the 
investigator may use results from tests performed for a patient’s routine care outside the study, 
provided that the results are documented in the patient’s medical record , and remain valid for the 
subject’s current medical condition in the investigator’s medical judgment. For example, this 
may include results from blood and urine analyses, physical examination, urodynamics , 
cystoscopy, and a pre -therapy diary  as described above.  Prior measurements of PTNS current 
required  for motor response or sensation  may be used.

3.5 Adverse events  and device deficiency definitions  
The investigator  will record and classify all adverse events and device deficiencies . They will 
record the onset and resolution times of each adverse event, noting the method of resolution.  
The investigator  will record all adverse events and classify them as:  
 Device -related, procedure -related, or non -related.  
 Serious or non -serious.  
 Unanticipated adverse device effects or other.  
An adverse event is any unfavorable medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
unfavorable clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), in a subject , whether device -
related, procedure -related, or non -related . It is also any such event, in a user or other person, if 
related to the study device.  
A device -related  adverse event is caused or contributed to by the study device . This definition 
includes adverse events involving insufficient or inadequate instructions for the study device, 
malfunction of  the study device, or use error or intentional misuse of the study device .  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 12 of 19 
 A procedure -related adverse event is caused or contributed to by a procedure required to use the 
study device .  
Because of the difficulty of determining the root cause of genitouri nary events, the investigator  
will categorize events conservatively as either device - or procedure -related unless there is clear 
evidence of other causation.  
A serious  adverse event is one that either:  
a) Led to death, or  
b) Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in:  
1) A life -threatening illness or injury, or 
2) A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
3) In-patient or prolonged hospitalization, or  
4) Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.  
Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the 
investigational plan, without serious deterioration in health, i s not considered a serious adverse 
event.  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is a serious adverse event that is device - or 
procedure -related, and is not identified in the protocol by its nature, incidence, severity, or 
outcome. The table below i dentifies potential serious adverse device effects:  
Nature  Incidence  Severity  Outcome  
Implant -procedure related 
complication: infection; damage to 
nerves, tissues, or vessels; 
migration; erosion or extrusion; 
pain at implant site.  < 40%, based on 
initial clinical 
experience of 
SNS Serious  Surgical revision 
including 
explant; intent -
to-treat failure.  
Increase in the pulse amplitude 
required for neuromodulation, 
beyond the range of the pulse 
generator.  < 15 % (one event 
maximum in an 
early feasibility 
trial) Serious  Surgical revision 
and/or loss of 
significant 
device function.  
Study device malfunction causing 
or contributing to failure to deliver 
neuromodulation therapy.  < 15 % (one event 
maximum in an 
early feasibility 
trial)  Serious  Surgical revision 
and/or loss of 
significant 
device function.  
Initial clinical experience of SNS: SNS studies reported frequent adverse events, including pain 
at the stimulator site (3.3 to 19.8% of patients), pain at the lead site (4.5 to 19.1% of patients), 
lead migration (2 .2 to 8.6% of patients), infection/irritation (2.2 to 14.30% of patients), electric 
shock (5.5 to 10.2 7.9% of patients) and need for surgical revision (6.25 to 39.5% of patients). In 
most studies, the need for surgical revision occurred in greater than 30 % of patients (Gormley, et 
al., 2014) . 
The investigator  will report all device deficiencies involving the study device, whether or not 
they involve adverse events . A device deficiency  is an inadequacy of a medical device with 
respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance . This includes 
malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 13 of 19 
 Timing: The investigator will report serious adverse events to the sponsor and IRB within 24 
hours . They will report other adverse events and device deficiencies to the sponsor within 30 
days.

The investigator will perform or supervise all required study procedures . The sponsor’s 
personnel may assist at study device implant, assessm ent of adverse events and device 
deficiencies, and measurement of response threshold .  
3.7 Investigator selection and training  
The sponsor will select a study site  and investigator capable of recruiting sufficient numbers of 
eligible subjects, representative of the target population for the study device.  
To help ensure the safe, proper, and consistent use of the investigational d evice , the sponsor will 
conduct a training program to educate  investigator s and their staff on the use of the study device. 
This trai ning will consist of didactic instruction, covering the device function s and principles of 
operation. Additionally, the training will highlight the important or unique aspects of the clinical 
study, such as screening, obtaining informed consent, the follow -up schedule, data collection 
methods, and adverse event reporting.  Finally, the training will include a cadaver study.  
4 Data management  
4.1 Case report forms (CRFs)  
Refer to § 3.1 on page 6.  
4.2 Procedures used for data review, database cleaning, and issuing and resolving data 
queries  
The sponsor will enter all CRF data into a central database . The sponsor will review all incoming 
data to identify inconsistent or missing data as well as any adverse events. The sponsor will 
promptly address any data issues with the investigator.  
4.3 Procedures for verification, validatio n and securing of electronic clinical data 
systems, if applicable.  
This clinical investigation will use paper CRFs rather than an electronic clinical data system.  
4.4 Procedures for data retention and specified retention period  
The sponsor and investigator wil l maintain the clinical investigation documents for a minimal 
period of five (5) years after the clinical investigation is completed, or longer depending on 
national requirements. They will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents and ensure these are filed in a secure place . Investigator or sponsor may transfer 
custody of records to another person or party and document the transfer at the investigation site, 
or at the sponsor's facility.  
The investigator will maintain  all source documents required by the protocol, including 
laboratory results, supporting medical records, and signed informed consent forms.  
4.5 Other aspects of clinical quality assurance, as appropriate  
The measures described in § 4.1 through § 4.4 provide appropriate clinical quality assurance fo r 
an early feasibility study.

5 Rationales for endpoints  
Safety endpoints: The adverse event endpoint in this study comes from FDA guidance (FDA, 
2011 -03-08) and is often u sed in medical -device studies . The neuromodulation pulse amplitude 
endpoint comes from the sponsor and is intended to detect functional changes in the interface 
between the stimulation electrode and the biological substrate it stimulates, analogous to paci ng 
thresholds measured in studies of cardiac electrode -leads.  
Effectiveness endpoints: OAB is a symptom complex with four factors: incontinence, frequency, 
nocturia, and urgency . For incontinence, objective endpoints for improvement and cure come 
from FDA guidance (FDA, 2011 -03-08). For the other OAB factors, objective endpoints for 
improvement are similarly defined as a 50  % reduction in pathological episodes: frequency 
(voids during waking hours exceeding 7), nocturia (voids aw akening from sleep), and urgency 
(voids with moderate to severe urgency) . Subjective endpoints (quality of life) are a 
questionnaire selected for  OAB symptoms including urinary incontinence and a global response 
assessment (Peters, et al., 2010) . 
5.1 Rationale for the criterion for improvement in frequency  
Frequency improvement is defined as a 50 % reduction from baseline of the number of voids 
during waking hours exceeding 7 . This criterion takes into account that traditionally up to 7 
micturition episodes during waking hours has been considered normal (Fitzgerald & Brubaker, 
2003) . This criterion is analogous to the criteria for improvement for the other three OAB 
components (incontinence, nocturia, and  urgency), all of which require a 50  % improvement in 
the number of pathological events . Seven or fewer daytime voids are not pathological . A 50  % 
improvement in daytime voids exceeding 7 is a 50  % improvement in pathological events . This 
same endpoint (50  % improvement in frequency exceeding normal) is currently used in an IDE 
trial for another OAB device, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  on clinicaltrials.gov.  
5.2 Rationale for the criterion for worsening  
Background:  
 In pre -IDE Q161967 the sponsor proposed defining a responder as a subject with significant 
improvement of at least one  OAB symptom  (e.g. 50 % better) . FDA provided feedback:  
“Patients would be considered ‘responders’ if they improve significantly by one of  those 
criteria but are overall worse in terms of their over active bladder (OAB) symptoms. Criteria 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 16 of 19 
 for ‘responder’ should depend upon the underlying diagnosis/diagnoses and require that the 
patient meet the elemen ts for all relevant diagnosis.” The sponso r was concerned that this 
required a subject to demonstrate significant improvement for every relevant  symptom to 
qualify as a responder, even though  improvement in a single symptom could have clinical 
significance.  
 Therefore i n Q161967/S001 the sponsor proposed defining a responder as a sub ject with 
significant improvement of at least one symptom  and no significant worsening of any othe r 
symptom (e.g. 50 % worse) . FDA provided feedback again:  “Worsening of incontinence 
episodes and the number of voids would be any increase over t he respective baseline number. 
A threshold of a 50% increase in order to be counted as worsening is arbitrary and lacks 
clinical meaning.”  The sponsor was concerned that with this definition,  a vanishingly small 
worsening  of one symptom could classify a subject as a non -responder , despite a significant 
improvement of one or more other symptoms.  
To address FDA’s and sponsor’s concerns , this protocol defines a responder as a subject 
demonstrating significant improvement of at least one relevant OAB symptom  (e.g. 50 % better) , 
and no worsening of their relevant  symptoms  overall  (worsening would be any increase overall) . 
Here “relevant” means meeting the  inclusi on criterion for a symptom at baseline , and “overall” 
means average of changes  over all relevant symptoms .  
For example, a subject with a baseline diary showing daily averages of 9 voids during waking 
hours, 3 interrupting sleep, 5 with urgency, and 0.3 wi th incontinence would meet the  study’s  
inclusion criteria in §2.1 for nocturia and urgency  (i.e. the subject would have two relevant 
symptoms) . If their therapy diary showed  daily averages of 1 void interrupting sleep and 6 with 
urgency, that would correspond to a  -67 % change (improvement) in nocturia but a +20 % 
change (worsening) in urgency, or an overall change of -44% (improvement). That  subject  would 
qualify as a responder.  
5.3 Dichotomous and continuous criteria  
This study requires a dichotomous  “responder” criterion for an individual subject, to inform a 
decision about allowing the subject to keep the study device after the 26 -week follow -up visit . 
As discussed above, FDA guidance also recommends dichotomous “improvement” criteria for 
individual subjects, e.g. 50 % symptom improvement.  
As a feasibility study, this protocol does not establish prospective criteria for effectiveness for all 
subjects a s a group. A pivotal study would establish hypothesis testing for statistics such as 
percentage s of subjects meeting a dichotomous criterion, and averages over subjects of a 
continuous parameter . To inform the design of the pivotal study , this feasibility study will report 
descriptive statistics ( including average , median, minimum, maximum,  and standard deviation) 
for all effectiveness endpoints, and will employ graphical displays such as spaghetti plots to 
represent individual changes.  
5.4 Effectiveness data f rom prior studies  
Many prior studies of PTNS have presented mean or median improvements, or responder 
percentages for subjective endpoints, but only a limited number have provided responder 
percentages for objective endpoints . The available studies show positive responses to PTNS, 
which are perhaps comparable to responses to SNS, although inclusion criteria and responder 
definitions varied across studies:  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 17 of 19 
  In a study of subject s with urge incontinence, 18 were treated with 12 PTNS sessions, and 17 
were tre ated with stimulation sessions in the medial part of the gastrocnemius muscle as 
controls (Finazzi -Agro, et al., 2010) . A responder was defined as a subject  showing >  50 % 
reduction in urge incontinence episodes . There were 71 % responders in the PTNS group and 
0 % in the control group (p < 0.001).  
 In a study of subject s with OAB  (defined as clinical complaints of urinary frequency, 
nocturia, and/or urgency incontinence),  8 were treated for 12 weeks with PTNS (Souto, Reis, 
Palma, Palma, & Denardi, 2013) . The percentage with urinary incontinence (any involuntary 
leakage of urine) decreased from 94  % to 11 % . The percentage with nocturia (waking one or 
more times at night to void) also decreased from 94  % to 11 %.  
 In a study of subject s with OAB  (defined as > 7 voids or > 2 urge incontinence episodes per 
24 hours)  who had previously demonstrated a reduction of more than 50  % in incontinence 
episodes or voids with PTNS, 8 had their PTNS treatment stopped  for at least 3 months and 
then were treated for 12 months with an implanted PTNS device (van der Pal, van Balken, 
Heesakkers, F.M.J., & Bemelmans, 2006) . Defining a responder as a subject with > 50 % 
improvement in an endpoint  and no increase in the other two endpoints, the table below 
shows percentages of responders (from 24 -hour voiding diaries):  
Responders  Baseline to month 3  Baseline to month 6  Baseline to month 12  
Voids  13% 25% 25% 
Nocturia  38% 50% 25% 
Incontinence  88% 63% 50% 
 In a study of subject s with OAB  (defined as > 8 voids per 24 h, or > 3 urge urinary 
incontinence episodes per week, or nocturia; and phasic detrusor contractions in the filling 
phase of saline cystometry) , 43 were treated for 6 weeks with PTNS (Yoong, Ridout, 
Damodaram, & Dadswell, 2010) . A positive response was defined as: (i) OAB symptoms no 
longer being bothersome; (ii) reduction by half in frequency episodes and (iii) reduction by 
25% in IIQ -7 outcomes . A positive re sponse rate of 69.7  % was found.  Yoong, et al., did not 
specify whether “frequency episodes” meant episodes per 24 hours or episodes exceeding 8 
per 24 hours.  
SNS studies showed comparable results  (Medtronic, Inc., 2011) : 
 For subject s with urge incontinence, 61 % of those undergoing SNS test procedures (naïve to 
SNS) experienced > 50 % improvement in leaking episodes . Of those who went on to a 
permanent implant, 75 % remained improved at six months .  
 For subject s with urgency -frequency, 36 % of those undergoing SNS test procedures 
experienced >  50 % improvement in urgency -frequency parameters (decrease in voids/day or 
increase in volume/void) . Of those who went on to a permanent implant, 34  % remained 
improved with a > 50 % decr ease in voids/day, and 54  % remained improved with > 50 % 
increase in volume/void.  
6 Rationale for type of design  
This clinical feasibility study has a si ngle-arm longitudinal design with no implanted comparator.  
The study’s small sample size, selected to l imit exposure to unforeseen risks during this first 
human use of the study device, does not provide sufficient power to test effectiveness changes 
versus  a concurrent control group.  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 18 of 19 
 This feasibility study has effectiveness endpoints for two other reasons: (a) to gain experience 
with the effectiveness assessments planned for a pivotal study; and (b) to assess an individual 
subject’s symptom improvement  with device use, to inform a decision about continued use after 
26 weeks.  
7 Future pivotal study  
If there is a successful  completion of this clinical feasibility study, the sponsor will propose a 
pivotal study to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for regulatory approval. If the feasibility 
study proceeds as planned, the pivotal study will be based on  the same procedures and endpoints , 
together with the additional information gained about effectively conducting a study in the target 
population.  
8 Deviations from clinical protocol  
Prior approval: The investigator will obtain prior written approval of a request for deviation 
from the protocol, from the investigator’s IRB, if the deviation affects subject’s rights, safety, 
and well -being, or the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation .  
Emergency: Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the protocol to protect the rights, 
safety and well -being of human subjects may proceed without prior app roval of the sponsor and 
the IRB . Such deviations shall be documented and reported to the sponsor and the IRB as soon as 
possible.  
Records: The investigator will us e the protocol deviation CRF listed in § 3.1 on page 6 for 
recording and reporting protocol deviations to the sponsor, and to the IRB or EC if required 
above .  
Corrective and preventive actions: The sponsor will review all reported deviations, and will 
cooperate with the investigator to implement corrective and preventive actions where 
appropriate . If necessary the sponsor may take additional action including terminating the 
investigator’s participation in the investigation.  
9 Suspension or premature termination of the clinical investigation  
Criteria: In respo nse to a concern about the rights, safety, or well -being of subjects, or about the 
scientific soundness of the study, which cannot be resolved by other means:  
 An investigator may suspend or prematurely terminate the study at his or her 
investigational site , after consultation with the sponsor .  
 The sponsor may suspend or prematurely terminate the study at one, several, or all 
investigational sites, after consultation with the investigator(s) concerned.  
Follow -up: During suspension the investigator  will cont inue scheduled follow -up, provided this 
does not adversely affect the rights, safety, or well -being of subjects . After premature or 
scheduled termination of the clinical study, the investigator  will provide medical care for the 
subjects after the clinical investigation has been completed, conforming to their standard 
practice.  
10 Amendments  
The sponsor and investigator will record approval and justification for any amendment to an 
approved protocol . If changes affect the scientific soundness of the clinical in vestigation, or 
affect the health, welfare, safety and rights of patients, the investigator and/or sponsor will obtain 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Nine Continents Medical,  Inc Revision date 2020 -05-21 Page 19 of 19 
 written approval by the investigator’s institutional review board (IRB) and FDA before 
implementing changes. If changes are merely admini strative in nature, the investigator will 
notify their site’s IRB.  
11 Device accountability  
The s ponsor will ship or convey investigational devices only to a qualified investigator s 
participating in  this clinical investigation. The s ponsor will not ship or c onvey investigational 
devices to any site until evidence of IRB approval has been provided to the sponsor or sponsor’s 
designee.  
Investigator s will control access to investigational devices, and will only use investigational 
devices in the clinical invest igation and according to the protocol.  
The s ponsor will keep records to document the physical location of each investigational device . 
Record(s) will include information documenting devices shipped or conveyed, devices at 
investigation sites, devices disp osed of, and devices returned.  
The i nvestigator will keep records documenting the receipt, use, return and disposal of the 
investigational devices, which will include:  
 Date of receipt,  
 Identification of each investigational device (serial number or uniq ue code),  
 Use-before date, if applicable,  
 Date or dates of use,  
 Subject identification,  
 Date on which the investigational device was returned, or explanted from subject, if 
applicable, and  
 Date of return of unused, expired or malfunctioning investigational devices, if applicable.  
12 Statements of compliance  
The investigator will conduct the clinical investigation in accordance with this protocol and an 
investigator agreement executed before beginning the study .  
The sponsor will provide clinical investigation insurance for subjects.  This will continue to cover 
direct costs associated with any device deficiencies after the subject exits from the study.  
The clinical investigation will be conduc ted in compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (“21 CFR”), Parts:  
 50, Protection of Human Subjects.  
 54, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators.  
 56, Institutional Review Boards.  
 812, Investigational Device Exemptions.  
13 Publication  policy  
For this clinical  feasibility study, the investigator agree s to maintain confidentiality and refrain 
from publication without the sponsor’s prior written approval.

Study ID: [REMOVED] Document date: 1/6/2025 
The objective of this study was to see whether autistic and non -autistic children comprehend  
verbs  and pronouns when the y are presented as  relevant to the child (e.g., addressed to them) 
or neutral (e.g.,  overheard) . For verbs, t he method was a behavioral experiment in which 
children’s learning was measured by their eye gaze to the intended target verb meaning. For 
pronouns, pronouns were presented as part of a game in which the child was either the 
addressee of the pronoun or was not, and the child’s comprehension was tested.  The method 
was a behavioral experiment in which children played a game live with two experimenters  who 
either addressed the child or each other with the pronouns  to refer to an object that belonged to 
one of the three players . Children’s selection of an object was the measure of pronoun 
comprehension. 
 For verbs: 
The primary dependent variable reported here for verbs is the proportion of time children spend 
looking at the target object in each conditio n. Track loss data points (that is, data points on 
which the child’s gaze could not be ascertained) are removed from analysis.  
 
The primary statistical test for this data is a one- sample t- test of the mean target looking by 
participant after children hear the verb .  
 For pronouns:  
The primary dependent variable reported here for pronouns is the first object children select  by 
touching or pointing it. Trials on which children did not respond are removed from analysis.  
 The primary statistical test for this data is a one -sample t- test of the mean target selection by 
participant after children hear the pronoun.

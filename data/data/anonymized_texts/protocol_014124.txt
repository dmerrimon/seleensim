Background   
Racial disparities in health outcomes are a major policy concern in the United States. Across all 
population subgroups, black men experience earlier morbidity and mortality from preventable or 
manageable conditions. On average, black males live 4.2 fewer y ears relative to white males.1 
One potential solution to this problem is increasing minority representation in the health  care 
workforce. Another is using financial incentives to encourage uptake of appropriate health care 
services. This research project h as two main components — to examine the impact of patient -
provider concordance and  of financial incentives on the take -up of preventive health services by 
black men in the U.S.  
Registration Timeline  
The study was registered with the American Economic Ass ociation (AEA) on 7th October 2017 . 
The trial entry can be found here:  https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/2497 . On 21 
March 2018  the PI uploaded a pre -analysis plan (PAP) that ou tlines the main hypotheses. At the 
time of submission,  the project was transitioning all data from a secure cloud to a secure server 
and continuing data entry. The PI did not perform any analyses prior to the PAP being uploaded . 
Fieldwork recruitment commenced on 7th October 2017 with the clinic opening on  14th October 
2017 . The last day of the experiment was 20th January 2018 . IRB clearance has been obtained 
from Stanford (#36255) and Berkeley  (# 2016 -02-8435 ) for this trial.  
Experimental Design   
The experimental design was as follows:  
(1) Recruitment: Adult men who self -identified as African American were recruited at 
community sites in the Oakland, CA area. Most recruitment sites were black -owned barber 
shops , though some men were recruited from flea markets, churches and schools . Thos e who 
chose to enroll in the study complete d a baseline survey regarding demographics, health status, 
history of health care utilization and trust. Survey completion was incentivized by haircut 
vouchers at the barbershop s or $10–$20 in cash, depending on the venue . The participants 
received coupons for free  cardiovascular  health screening s to redeem at a clinic that was run on

 Saturdays specifically for the purposes of the study. It was emphasized that the doctors would 
not be able to address other health concerns. Uber donated ride -sharing services to transport 
individuals to and from the clinic .  
(2) Presentation and ex -ante demand: Subjects who presented at t he clinic  were randomized to a 
male study doctor and  an incentive amount . After check -in, the subject was placed in a private 
patient room . At that point, the subject was given an unconditional cash payment for presentation 
at the clinic ($50). Afterwards, the subject was introduced to their assigned doctor  through a 
tablet device , which included a generic description of the doctor’s background and his actual 
photo . Subjects were then asked to select which of five preventative health care services they 
would like to receive from their assigned doctor. One of the services — a flu shot — was a 
surprise service the subjects learned about on presentation, at which point they were randomly 
offered a financial incentive ($0, $5, $10) conditional on selecting to receive the vaccination .  
(3) Ex -post demand: After selecting the desired services , the assigned doctor met with the 
subject. Study doctors were provided with a list of each subject’s ex -ante demand; however, they 
were instructed to encourage participants to obtain all of the services . The doctors were informed 
that, due to restrictions  on the malpractice coverage purchased for the study, they were not able 
to provide services outside those in the screening. The ex -post demand (the demand after 
interacting with the assigned doctor) was also recorded. Subjects were asked to fill out a 
satisfaction survey after the encounter.  
Specific Aims/Hypotheses Tested  
The specific aims of the study are as follows : 
H1.) To determine whether ex-ante demand for preventive health screening services, including 
an unanticipated influenza vaccination, is  higher among black male subjects  randomized to a 
racially concordant doctor .  
H2.) To determine whether ex-post demand for preventive health screening services, including 
an unanticipated influenza vaccination, is higher among black male subjects  randomized to a 
concordant doctor .  
H3.) To determine whether subjects revise their choices after meeting with a concordant doctor 
(i.e. the difference between ex -post and ex -ante demand).  
H4.) To assess whether the impact of having a concordant doctor and/or subsidy on the ex-ante 
take-up, ex-post take-up, and delta between ex -ante and ex -post take-up is greater among various 
groups  with like characteristics . Potential heterogeneous effects are as follows :  
A) The effects may differ for those who are more mistrustful of the me dical system at 
baseline. T his will be proxied for by baseline scores on medical mistrust questions.  
B) The effects may differ for those already engaged with  health  care and/or thos e with 
major medical conditions versus those who are les s engaged .  
C) The effects may differ for those who have different demographic backgrounds, 
such as age, education, income and marital status.  
D) The effects may differ for those who experienced greater hassle costs during the 
choice process (ex ante or ex post) — such as longer wait times  or clinic 
 
3 
 encounters at certain  times of day, which may  impact outcomes  due to fatigue or 
hunger.2    
E) The effects may differ  for those who were recruited from certain locations, and for 
those who were told to come to recruitment venues through social networks vs. 
those who naturally encountered enumerators in the field . 
H5.) To determine whether financial incentives increase ta ke-up of the flu shot, and to assess 
whether incentives function as substitutes or complements to concordance in influencing demand 
for the flu shot. 
H6.) To assess whether subjects report higher satisfaction when assigned to a concordant doctor  
or when assigned to a higher financial incentive . 
H7.) To assess whether doctors spend a longer time  with or field more questions from 
concordant patients.  
H8.) To assess whether more nuanced categorizations of race and its construct s influence subject 
take-up.  
A) To assess whether  there are differential effects on take -up when  black doctors are 
compared to different types of non -black doctors .3   
B) To assess whether perceived race vs. self -reported race by doctors has differential effects 
on take -up.4  
Because we are testing multiple hypotheses , we will use techniques that limit the false discovery 
rate.5  
Econometric Specifications  
Our main sample of interest will be the subject s who self-identify as black men, visit the clinic 
and meet with a study doctor  (i.e. subjects that complete the Informed Consent, Baseline Field 
Survey, Clinic Tablet Survey, and the Clinic Encounter Form) .6 The primary test of interest  is 
evaluating the effects of concordance between patient and physician on preventative health  care 
choices. Our core specification evaluates treatment effects for H1 and H2 as follows:

3 In pilot focus group work , black men ranked doctors (based on photos) they w ould be most likely to trust with a 
clear preference for concordant doctors, yet some other race/eth nicity groups ranked higher than others.

photos of the study doctors .

6 If a subject changes identify (race/gend er/ethnicity) after enrollment (i.e. they no longer self -identify as a black 
male ) they will be excluded from the analysis.

 𝑌𝑖=𝛼+𝛽𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖𝑗+∑𝛾𝑘𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑘
𝑘+𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑐′𝛺+𝜀𝑖,        Equation (1) 
where 𝑖 is subject , 𝑗 is doctor  and 𝑐 is clinic . 𝑌 is a measure of the choice of preventative 
services (see the “Outcome Measures” tab of the spreadsheet for further details ). 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒  
measure s whether the race of the doctor matches the race of the subject (i .e. black). E xtensions 
of this definition use multi -dimensional measures of concordance combining race, age and 
education (see the “Concordance Measures” tab for further details). 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒  is an indicator 
variable for the $5 or $10 amounts — the $0 category will be omitted. 𝑋, included in some 
specifications, will be a set of background characteristics on the subject  as well as details on the 
clinic such as time of day , date, waiting room congestion, staff characteristics , and seasonality 
since all can influence the subject ’s clinical experience and potentially the return for some of the 
preventative care services .7 Including these variables in the analysis could increase  the precision  
of our treatment effect estimates .  
To test H3, the difference s in ex ante and ex post demand will be assessed according to the 
following specification:  
∆𝑌𝑖=𝛼+𝛽𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖𝑗+∑𝛾𝑘𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑘
𝑘+𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑐′𝛺+𝜀𝑖,     Equation (2) 
All variables are defined as in Equation (1) except the outcome of interest is now the difference 
between choices made in  the ex ante and ex post period s.  
To evaluate H4, 𝑋 will be augmented to include interactions between the 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒  measure 
and/or the 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒  measure and baseli ne covariates obtained from subject surveys performed 
in the field . This modification tests whether effects are stronger for certain subgroups of the 
population. Alsan’s prior work on the historical effect of the Tuskegee experiment suggests  that 
the treatment might have a larger effect for groups that have lower education, lower income or 
higher mistrust at baseline.8 For a complete list of heterogeneous effects  and their particular pre -
specified coding , please see the spreadsheet tab entitled “Hetero geneity .” As noted in H4D , wait 
times could influence subject’s engagement with the choices and the experiment overall . The 
study will collect various wait times in the clinical setting. The first wait time is from check -in at 
the door to check -in at the front desk  (WT1) . The second wait time will be from check -in at the 
desk to entry into a patient room (WT2). There will be a final time recorded when the subject 
exits the patient room after visiting with the doctor. The sum of the first two wait times measures 
time in the lobby. Wait times will be instrumented for by using the number of subjects who have 
checked into the clinic within a given time frame (i.e. 3 hours) and the number of doctors 
available at that clinic day. In addition to wait time from con gestion , doctors vary in their time 
per patient. This can be instrumented for using the leave -one-out average wait time for a given 
                                                        
7 Seasonality will influence flu since the flu shot might become less valuable over time as individuals have other 
opportunities to become vaccinated. On the other hand , if the flu season is particularly bad and is covered a lot in the 
media,  demand  could also increase  over time .

 doctor (omitting the index subject). Both wait times measure s will be controlled for explicitly 
and interacted with the main treatment effects to assess how they influence take -up decisions.   
To test H5, the incentive indicators will be interacted with concordance measures. If the  
marginal effect of incentives interacted with concordance is positive, this implies  that incentives 
and concordance are complements. If, on the other hand, concordance interacted with incentives 
is negative and statistically significant, then that implies  the two interventions are substitutes.  
 
The s pecification to test H6 is a modification of Equation (1) with the 𝑌 encompassing responses 
from the questionnaire that subjects completed after the visit with the study doctor. Similarly, H7 
replaces outcome measures with information collected by the doctor during the screening — 
including information on whether the subject asked them additional health questions and how 
long they spent with the subject. For H8, black doctors will be coded as an indicator separately 
from an indicator for white  doctors  and from  an indicator specifically for Asian doctors. This 
will afford an examination of whether take -up differs across all three groups. Using a separate 
survey instrument on a sample of men who share study characteristics  with the sample recruited 
from Oakland, perceptions of study doctors based on their photos will be collected. These  data 
will allow for a test on whether self-assessed or perceived race matter more for the primary 
outcomes in H1 and H2.  
 
Additional Quality Checks  
In addition to the evaluation plan detailed above and in the accompanying excel file, a series of 
standard quality checks will be performed on the data to ensure fidelity of the randomization and 
integrity of the design. First, a balance te st will be performed to confirm that treatment 
(concordance or incentive amounts) does not predict baseline socio -demographic features of the 
subjects . Second, differential attrition  across study arms  will be assessed. A ttrition in this context 
is defined as when subjects initiate a  check -in at the clinic (and thus are randomized) but do not 
complete the study visit. Assuming that there is no differential attrition across arms, the main 
analytical sample will be those subjects who both came to the c linic and completed the visit with 
a study doctor. If there is evidence of selective attrition , then bounds will be used and/or the 
sample including those who attritted will be used as an alternative . Third, JPAL’s replication 
service will be used prior to publication and pending IRB approval for the replication service  to 
access the data.

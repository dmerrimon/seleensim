  3. Study Design 
 
3.1 Study Type  
 
This is a randomized, paired- comparisons design where each subject receives two of 
the planned treatments.

3.2 Primary Endpoint /Analysis 
 The study will be analyzed per the standards of the 1994 Tentative Final Monograph 
(TFM) for Effectiveness Testing of a Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation (FR 59:116, 17 June 94, pp. 31450- 31452) , as updated by recent recommendations by 
the FDA on responder rates .  The primary efficacy criteria will be assessed based on 
log
10 CFU/cm2 reduction s at the 10- minute sampling time. The TFM indicates log 10 
CFU/cm2 reductions as the primary efficacy measure while the Proposed 
Amendment of the Tentative Final Monograph (FR 80:84, 01 May 2015)  indicates 
responder rates as the primary efficacy requirement . This study will use responder 
rate at 10 minutes post -prep as the primary measure of efficacy but will also 
calculate and show log 10 CFU/cm2 reductions from baseline.

MicroBioTest - Confidential  
  The primary measure of antimicrobial efficacy is the reduction of skin flora on the 
abdominal and groin sites at 10  minutes following application of the study treatments 
relative to the Treatment Day baseline counts.  
The reduction will be calculated by a perc ent successes approach (i.e. percent of 
subjects meeting required reductions = responder rate ).  A site is considered a 
responder for the treatment  at the indicated time point  if the criteria in the following 
table are met:   
Table 3.2 :  Minimum  and Maximum  Treatment Day Baseline and Expected Mean Log 10 
Reduction per Anatomical Site  
Anatomical Site  Minimum  and Maximum  
Treatment Day Baseline*  Expected Mean Log 10 
Reduction  
Abdomen 1.0 x 103 – 3.2 x 105 CFU/cm2
  
(3.0 Log 10 – 5.5 Log 10) 2.0 log 10 @ 10 -minutes  
Groin  1.0 x 105 – 3.2 x 107 CFU/cm2
  
(5.0 Log 10 – 7.5 Log 10) 3.0 log 10 @ 10 minutes 
*Note: For the Screening Day b aseline, the maximum upper limit does not apply.  Only the 
minimum criteria must be met.  
  
Responder status will be  calculated separately for the abdomen and groin, for each 
test substance, for each post -treatment sample time, and for each subject. The 
individual responses will then be grouped to generate an overall responder rate for 
each anatomical area, for each test substance, and for each post -treatment time . 
The primary efficacy goal for active products is to have the lower bound of the 95% 
confidence interval for the responder rates at 10 minutes  to be greater than or equal 
to 70%.   
 
Secondary Endpoint s/Analysis 
 Responder rates at 30 seconds will be calculated identically to the 10 minute rates. 
At 6 hours a site is considered a responder if it is below baseline; otherwise, 6- hour 
responder rates will be calculated identically to the 10-minute responder rates. The 
secondary efficacy goals are to have the 95% confidence intervals for the responder 
rates to be greater than or equal to 70% . Log
10 CFU reductions from baseline will 
also be calculated for all post -prep samples.  
 
Study Validity  
 
For a valid study, the active control must make the same objectives that the test article does and both the test article and the active control should be superior to the 
inactive control for the primary endpoint . The responder rates for both active and 
inactive treatments at 6 hours are near 100%. Therefore, comparison of responder 
rates at 6 hours is unlikely to show any difference. Differences in log
10 CFU/cm2 
reductions from baseline will be used at 6 hours in order to show that the active 
treatments are more effective than the inactive control.

3.3 Randomization and Blinding  
 
Subjects will be randomized before treatment , after screening eligibility is 
determined.  Subjects will be randomized to treatme nt using the following block 
design:  
 
Treatment Balance 
Each subject will receive two different treatments, one on the right side of the body and one on the left.    The treatment assignments will be balanced such that the number of readings per anatomical site matches  the calculated requirements.  
 
Left/Right Balance  
The application will be randomized so that each treatment is used on an equal 
number of left and right sides of the body . 
 
Site and Sample Time Balance 
Within each anatomical site, sampling order will be randomized for baseline, 30 second, 10 minute, and 6 hour  samples based on the statistical consultant’s 
randomization plan. 
 The randomization plan has been updated  
  
 
. 
 The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the randomi zation is followed. A 
basic outline of a randomization schedule for the abdominal  and groin sites is 
provided in Appendix 14.4. The final randomization schedule will be prepared before the initial treatment.  The test and control articles  will be labeled with the appropriate 
codes as designated by the study randomization.   
 Subjects will be identified by their initials, a screening ID number, and a subject 
number corresponding to each body region in the study for which they qualify.  
Subject numbers will not be assigned until a subject has passed the screening 
criteria, including baseline bacterial counts (at least 1.0 x 10
5 CFU/cm2 in the groin 
and at least 1. 0 x 103 CFU/cm2 on the abdomen) . Subjects whose abdominal and 
groin regions qual ify will be assigned the subject number. Therefore, for each of the  
participating subject will be assigned two identification numbers .

  • Screening subjects will be assigned numbers ranging from 9001 to 9999.  
 
• Subjects to be treated (including treatment day baseline collection) will be  
assigned sequential numbers ranging from 0001 up to the total number of 
test subjects treated.  
 
The study materials will not be blinded from the Investigator or other study staff 
performi ng the study material application or bacterial sample collections. The staff 
member(s) performing bacterial enumeration will be blinded from the identification of treatment assignment.  The study staff performing the bacterial enumeration will not be involved in the study material application or the collection of samples. The Raw Data Sheet sections of the case report form will be maintained separately (from the pages within the case report form which include study treatment identifications) during the conduct phase of the study. The study staff performing the bacterial enumeration will record counts directly onto the Raw Data Sheet pages of the case report form without accessing the subject study documentation folder containing the other case report form pages. The Raw Data Sheets will be compiled with the entire case report form after all data recording has been completed. The CRF will serve as 
the source document.

3.5 Study Duration  
 
The expected duration of this study for each subject is up to 3- 4 weeks.  Subjects will 
undergo at least a 14 -day washout period followed by a qualification screening 
baseline visit. Subjects whose screening baseline samples meet the minimum values described in the Inclusion Criteria (Section 4.1) will be notified and invited to participate in the treatment phase of the study. The treatment phase will be scheduled no sooner than 72 hours from the screening baseline collection.     
3.6 Study Termination/Subject Discontinuation or Withdrawal/Subject Revocation 
of Authorization  
 
3.6.1  Study Termination  
 
Zurex Pharma, Inc.  or the Investigator has the right to discontinue the study 
at any time for medical and/or administrative reasons.  As far as possible, this should occur after mutual consultation.  
3.6.2  Subject Discontinuation and Withdrawal  
 The Investigator may discontinue individual subjects from the study at any time.  Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time without reason or consequence. The subject will be asked to report the reason for withdrawal. The Investigator will provide a written report on the appropriate 
case report form (CRF) including the date and reason for discontinuance.  Subjects who qualify on Screening Day and begin the treatment phase may not be re -entered into the study, regardless of whether or not they completed 
the study.

Any enrolled subject will be discontinued for the following reasons:  
 
1. A skin irritation rating of 3 for any individual skin condition at any 
evaluation following the application of study treatment. (A skin irritation rating of 2 for any individual skin condition at any evaluation following the application of study material may also be the cause for 
subject discontinuation at the discretion of the Investigator.) 
2. Experiencing a serious protocol deviation that compromises the data 
results, for example, using a topical antibiotic at a test site during the study.  
 
See section 8. 5 for handling of  withdrawn subject data.  
 
3.6.3  Subject Revocation of Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information  
 
In order to implement a valid revocation of authorization, the subject or their representative must make the request in writing to MicroBioTest ,  
 The revocation cannot stop the use or 
disclosure of information that has been collected prior to the revocation, or is needed to ensure complete and accurate study results, and/or is required by law or government regulation (e.g., reporting adverse events, etc.).  Revocation of an authorization may not be used to withhold normal medical care from the subject, but may [or will] make the subject ineligible to receive the study treatment or care.  
  
3.7 Treatment Material Accountability  
 Zurex Pharma, Inc.  requires Investigators to maintain accountability and adequate 
inventory security of the study material at all times. The Investigator or designee will:  
 
• complete the Confirmation of Release and Receipt of Study Materials  form 
(Appendix 14.8) upon receipt  of the shipment and maintain and account for 
inventory on the Study Material Disposition form (Appendix 14.9).  
• keep study materials in a secure storage area, accessible only to authorized 
individuals.  
• dispense study material only to subjects properly enrolled into the study.  
• return all unused study materials to Zurex Pharma, Inc.  at the end of the study or 
dispose of unused study materials as agreed upon.

•  
 
4. Subject Selection  
 
Healthy volunteers with no dermatological conditions or known history of sensitivity to 
natural rubber latex, adhesive skin products (e.g., Band -Aids, medical tapes),  isopropyl 
alcohol, citric acid, methylene blue, methylparaben, propylparaben,  or chlorhexidine 
gluconate will be enrolled into this study. A sufficient number of volunteers will be enrolled 
in the screening phase such that the total number of abdominal regions and the total number of groin regions meets  or exceeds the number determined for the study ( 320 
abdominal regions and 320 groin regions  for the test article and reference article; and 64  
abdominal regions and 64  groin regions for the negative control).  Subjects must satisfy all 
Screening Day and Treatment Day Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria prior to screening sample collection and Treatment Day procedures. V olunteers will be recruited and treated in 
blocks until the count of results in the mITT population meets or exceeds the required test 
material/region counts . 
 A subject must qualify  for both the abdominal portion and the groin portion of the study. 
The right and left sides of the abdomen and groin must meet the minimum baseline values 
stated in the Inclusion Criteria.  
 
Subjects who are treated but discovered to have Treatment Day baseline counts below the minimum values  or above the maximum values  stated in Table 3.2 will not be included in 
the primary efficacy analysis  based on the body site(s) that did not qualify  due to not 
meeting the treatment day baseline inclusion criteria - see section 4.1 . 
 Subjects will be identified at screening by their initials  and a screening ID number. Subject 
numbers will not be assigned until a subject has passed the screening criteria, including baseline bacterial counts.  All volunteers will be given verbal and written information about the study procedures, and Subject Instructions (Appendix 14.6) will be provided to each subject for the pretreatment

4.3 Subject Consent  
 The Investigator or designated sub- investigators trained by the Investigator must 
ensure that written informed consent to participate in the investigation is obtained before including any individual as a subject in the investigation. The Invest igator or 
designated sub- investigators trained by the Investigator must provide the prospective 
subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate, and minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The process 
is designed to 1) give the subject all the information needed, 2) ensure that the subject understands the information, and 3) give the subject a chance to consider study participation. The process should permit the subject to ask questions and exchange information freely.  
 Specifically, the Investigator or designated sub- investigators trained by the 
Investigator is to explain to each subject all elements of informed consent as specified in 21 CFR 50.25 (Appendix 14.5). After the explanation, subjects or their representative will voluntarily sign and date the consent form if they wish to participate in the study.  A copy of the consent form must be provided to the subject. A signed 
and dated consent form must be maintained in the Investigator s tudy documentation 
file at all times.  
 
4.4 Subject Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information  
 
The Investigator or designated sub- investigators trained by the Investigator must 
ensure that written authorization for use and disclosure of Protected Health 
Information (PHI) is obtained before including any individual as a subject in the investigation.  
 Specifically, the Investigator or designated sub- investigators trained by the 
Investigator is to explain to each subject all elements of authorization as specified in 
45 CFR 164.508. After the explanation, subjects or their representative must

The Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria will be reviewed with each subject 
to ensure eligibility for the study.  If these criteria are satisfied, subjects will sign the consent form and HIPAA Authorization Form 
before screening phase study procedures begin. Prior to the 
scheduled Screening Day, subjects will undergo a minimum 14 -
day washout period. The subjects will be instructed to avoid 
contact with any topical or systemic antimicrobial products for the duration of their involvement in the study as written in the Subject Instructions (Appendix 14.6). If it becomes necessary to take systemic antibiotics or to apply topical medications to the test areas within this pretreatment period, the subject must contact the Investigator as soon as reasonably possible so that ano ther 
volunteer may be recruited.  
 Restrictions include, but are not limited to: 
• Use of antimicrobial soaps, shampoos, lotions, perfumes, after 
shaves, colognes, antiperspirants, deodorants  
• Contact with materials such as acids, bases, solvents  
• Swimming in chemically treated pools and bathing in hot tubs, spas and/or whirlpools

  • Use of tanning beds, hot waxes or depilatories (including 
shaving)  
 
Subjects will be provided a kit with non- antimicrobial personal care 
products for exclusive use during the study.  Subjects will also be 
provided with written instructions regarding the use of these products (Appendix 14.6).  
 A visual skin assessment of the test areas will be performed. If subjects require hair removal to facilitate sample collection, the 
subject will be asked to return to the test facility at least 48 hours 
before the Screening Day.  
 Subjects will be required to refrain from bathing or showering for 72 hours prior to both the Screening Day and Treatment Day.  
 Sponge bathing will be allowed, however, the subject must avoid the lower abdomen and upper thigh region.  
 
5.1.1.2  Screening Day (Qualification Baseline Sampling)  
 
Subjects will be required to refrain from bathing or showering 72 
hours prior to Treatment Day and hair will be clipped at least 48 hours prior  to Screening Day.  
 After the washout period and at least 3- days before Treatment 
Day, the Investigator or a designated assistant will complete the Screening Day Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria page in each subject’s CRF.   
 
Prior to performing the Screening Day baseline sample collection, 
a skin irritation assessment will be performed  
 
If an irritation score of 1 for any  individual skin condition at the 
Screening Day baseline is assigned, the subject will be excluded from the study.    A baseline screening sample will be collected from each test area using the Williamson- Kligman scrub cup technique
3. Baseline 
samples will be taken from the center of each contra lateral  test 
area within each anatomical region.  Samples from both the left 
and right sides of a body region must meet the minimum value indicated in the Inclusion Criteria for the subject to be enrolled into the treatment phase of the study for that region. Subjects must

 Subjects who qualify for the study will be notified and will continue 
to follow the subject instructions until completion of the scheduled Treatment Day.  
 
Subjects will again be required to refrain from bathing or 
showering 72 hours prior to Treatment Day and hair will be clipped 
at least 48 hours prior to Treatment Day.  
 
5.1.2  Treatment Phase Study Procedures  
 A sufficient number of subjects who meet the entrance criteria will be enrolled into the treatment phase of the study for each region, such that the total number of abdominal regions and the total number of groin regions meets or exceeds the number required ( 320 abdominal regions and 320 groin regions  
for the test article and reference article; and 64  abdominal regions and 64  
groin regions for the negative control) . The randomization schedule will 
designate the treatment to each side of the abdomen and groin.  
 The Treatment Day Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria CRF will be completed. If 
these criteria are satisfied, a visual skin assessment will be perf ormed to 
evaluate the condition of each test area.  
5.1.2.1  Preparation of Test Areas on Treatment Day  
 
A Test Site Diagram for the abdominal  and groin test areas is 
shown in Appendix 14.3.  Note: skin irritation will be assessed for 
all assigned test areas prior to treatment of any test area.   
  
5.1.2.1.1  Preparation of Abdominal Test Area  
 
The test site within the abdominal region (abdominal test area) is defined as the area below the umbilicus and above the groin. Using a 5” x 5” sterile template, the corners of each abdominal test area will be marked directly on the skin using a non- toxic skin marker. Four 
sampling sites will be numbered within each abdominal test area, on each side of the abdominal  region. The 
positioning and numbering of the abdominal sampling sites are standard for all subjects. Sampling sites on the contra -lateral side of the abdomen will be 
numbered in a mirror -image orientation. The four

  sampling sites within each abdominal  test area 
represen t one baseline (pre- prep) site, and one post -
prep sampling site for each of three sampling times  (30 
seconds, 10 minutes , and 6 hour s).   
 
Prior to performing the Treatment Day baseline sample collection, a skin irritation assessment will be 
performed.  
 
If an irritation score of 1 for any individual skin condition at the Treatment Day baseline is assigned, the subject will be excluded from the treatment phase of the study. After abdominal test areas are marked and sample sites numbered, baseline samples will be collected from the appropriate site per the randomization schedule (Appendix 14.4) in each test area using the scrub cup tec hnique.  
 
5.1.2.1.2  Preparation of Groin Test Area  
 The test site within the groin region (groin test area) is defined as the inner aspect of the upper thigh within and parallel to the inguinal crease below the groin.  Using a 1.5” x 5”  sterile template, the corners of each 
groin test area will be marked directly on the skin using a non- toxic skin marker. Four sampling sites will be 
numbered within each groin test area, on each side of the groin region. The positioning and numbering of t he 
groin sampling sites are standard for all subjects.  Sampling sites on the contra -lateral side of the groin 
will be numbered in a mirror -image orientation. The 
four sampling sites within each groin  test area 
represent one baseline (pre- prep) site, and one post -
prep sampling site for each of three sampling times ( 30 
seconds, 10 minutes, and 6 hour s).   
 Prior to performing the Treatment Day baseline sample collection, a skin irritation assessment will be performed.  
 If an irritation score of 1 for any individual skin condition at the Treatment Day baseline is assigned, the subject will be excluded from the treatment phase of the study. After groin test areas are marked and

paper towel.  
 
5.2 Microbiological Methods 
 
5.2.1  Microbial Sample Collection / Scrub Cup Technique  
 
Quantitative cultures (screening baselines, treatment baselines and post 
treatment application) will be obtained by a modification of the cylinder sampling technique of Williamson -Kligman scrub cup technique.  To collect 
the samples, a sterile scrub cup  will be placed on the site and 
held firmly to the skin. Sampling solution (SS) ( ) will be pipetted into 
the cup and the skin will be scrubbed in a circular motion with moderate pressure for 1 minute using a sterile rubber policeman. Using a sterile 
transfer pipette, the SS will be removed and placed in a sterile test tube.  An 
additional  of fresh sampling solution will be pipetted into the cup and 
the scrub procedure will be repeated. This solution will be pooled with the first 
solution collected.   
 
5.2.2  Sampling Solution  (SS) 
 The SS consists of sterile [75mM phosphate buffer (  
 containing  l
 ecithin,  Tween® 
80, and  Tamol, ]2 (SS). 
 
5.2.3  Bacterial Enumeration Methods  
 
Following sample collection, 10-fold serial dilutions (1 mL sample + 9 mL 
PBW) will be prepared using Butterfield’s phosphate buffered water with 
neutralizers (PBW ). One mL aliquots of appropriate dilutions will be pour -
plated in duplicate using trypticase soy agar containing neutralizers (TSA+N).  
Samples must be plated within 3 0 minutes of collection. After 72 ± 4 hours of 
aerobic incubation at 30 ± 2C, colonies will be counted and viable cells in the 
original sample will be calculated according to Standard Operating Procedures. After incubation, plates may be refrigerated up to 48 hours prior to counting.   
 Raw colony counts from each dilution will be recorded on the appropriate 
CRFs for each subject. The average number of microorganisms recovered 
(CFU/cm
2) of skin for the screening and treatment day baseline samples will 
be calculated using the following formul a to convert the plate CFU values into  
CFU/cm2 of skin:

For each batch of plating medium, TSA+N, fewer than 100 CFU of 
 will be inoculated in a single plate 
pour plate. A  aged culture of  will be 
serially diluted in dilution fluid. The CFU added will be confirmed using 
duplicate trypticase soy agar (TSA) spread plates. The plates will be 
incubated for 72 ±  4 hours of aerobic incubation at 30 ± 2C. 
 
5.2.5  Neutralizer Validation  
 The effectiveness of the neutralizer system must be validated prior to the study start date to demonstrate that the antimicrobial is effectively neutralized and there is no effect on the growth of microorganisms. A procedure that will include in- vivo sampling will be combined with an in- vitro evaluation using 
procedures in accordance with ASTM E1054- 08
4. The procedure is attached 
as Appendix 14.10. These data must be provided in the final report.  
 
5.3 Medication(s)/Treatment(s) Not Permitted  
 Topical or systemic antimicrobial exposure is not permitted within 14 days prior to the day of Screening Day, and during the study.  Restrictions include, but are not limited to antimicrobial soaps, antiperspirants/deodorants, shampoos, lotions, perfumes, after shaves, colognes, and topical or systemic antibiotics.

  5.4   Subject Compliance 
 
Answers to the inclusion/exclusion questions (Inclusion/Exclusion CRFs) asked at 
the beginning of the screening and treatment phases will determine compliance to the Subject Instructions (Appendix 14.6) provided to each subject upon study participation. Documentation of the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria shall serve as confirmation of subject compliance with the Subject Instructions.  
 
6. Assessment of Efficacy 
 
6.1 Efficacy Parameters  
 
The primary measure of antimicrobial efficacy is the reduction of skin flora on the 
abdominal and groin sites 10 minutes following application of the study treatments 
relative to the Treatment Day baseline counts. 
 
The reduction will  first be calculated as log
10 CFU/cm2 changes from baseline, then 
the percentage of successes will be calculated from the log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction s 
(i.e. percent of subjects meeting required reductions = responder rate). A site is 
considered a responder for the treatment at 10 minutes if it achieves ≥ 2.0 log 10 
CFU/cm2 reduction on the abdomen or ≥ 3.0 log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction on the groin.  
 
Responder status will be calculated separately for the abdomen and groin, for each 
test substance, for each post -treatment sample time,  and for each subject. The 
individual responses will then be grouped to generate an overall responder rate for 
each anatomical area , for each test substance, and for each post -treatment sample 
time. The efficacy goal for active products is to have the lower bound of the 95% 
confidence interval for the responder rate to be greater than or equal to 70%.  
 Secondary Endpoint s/Analysis 
 
Responder rates at 30 seconds will be calculated identically to the 10 minute rates. 
At 6 hours a site is considered a responder if it is below baseline; otherwise, 6- hour 
responder rates will be calculated identically to the 10-minute responder rates. The 
secondary efficacy goals are to have the 95% confidence intervals for the responder rates to be greater than or equal to 70% . Log
10 CFU reductions from baseline will 
also be calculated for all post -prep samples.  
 
Study Validity  
 
For a valid study, the active control must make the same objectives that the test article does and both the test article and the active control should be superior to the 
inactive control at the primary endpoint . The responder rates for both active and 
inactive treatments at 6 hours are near 100%. Therefore, comparison of responder 
rates at 6 hours is unlikely to show any difference. Differences in log
10 CFU/cm2 
reductions from baseline will be calculated for 6 hours in order to show that the active treatments are more effective than the inactive control.

6.2 Assessment Methods  
 
Efficacy will be assessed by sampling the skin using the cup scrub method described in Section 5.2.  See Section 8.0 for analysis methods. 
 
7. Assessment of Safety  
 7.1 Safety Parameters  
 
The principal measures of safety will be the recording of skin irritation scores and the incidence of adverse events reported during the study.  
 
7.2 Assessment Methods for Skin Irritation  
 After the washout period, the Investigator or designated sub -investigators trained by 
the Investigator will assess the subject’s skin condition and assign a skin irritation rating score (see Appendix 14.11).  A skin irritation score will be recorded at both the screening and treatment phases prior to baseline sample collections and prior to 
each post treatment application sample collection (30 seconds, 10 minutes, and 6 
hours).  
   
A corresponding rating score for each individual skin condition, for each site will be recorded in the subject’s CRF. (See Appendix 14.11, which includes the following four independent evaluation categories:  Erythema, Edema, Rash, and Dryness).  
If an irritation score of 1 or greater for any individual skin condition prior to the baseline sample collection (at either the screening or treatment day phases) is 
assigned, the subject will be excluded from the study (no study treatment will be applied).  
 If an irritation score of 3 for any individual skin condition at any observation period is assigned,  the subject will be discontinued from the study and an adverse event will 
be recorded. See Section 7.3 (Adverse Events).  
7.3 Adverse Events  
 
 The Investigator is responsible for identifying adverse events that occur to each subject throughout the study and follow -up period. An adverse event can occur at 
any time during the conduct of the study. Adverse events will be captured for all subjects from the time of screening baselines are taken until the time of discharge from the study. An adverse event  can be identified by the Investigator or reported by 
the subject.

  8. Statistics  
 
8.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all subjects who pass the pre- test 
period prior to baseline screening and are assigned a subject number for treatment. 
The ITT population (all randomized subjects) will be used for the safety analysis.  
 
 
a Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT)  
Population will be used for analysis and consist of all subjects who have at least one 
site (left or right for abdominal or inguinal) that  passed the treatment day baseline 
and has CFU results for any other sample time for that site. Body sites will be 
included in the mITT population if and only if they meet the treatment day baseline 
criteria. The mITT  data set will be evaluated for efficac y. 
 
8.2 Statistical Methods  
 
8.2.1  Efficacy Analyses  
 
CFU values will be calculated as per the Bacterial Enumeration methods above. 
Individual plate CFU counts that are zero will be treated as 0.5 for further 
calculations. Changes from baseline will be  calculated separately for each subject 
and for each of the three non- baseline sites by taking the baseline log 10 CFU/cm2 
values and then subtracting the log 10 CFU/cm2 values for the samples taken after the 
baseline. Therefore, a subject who completes all treatments and passes all baseline 
requirements will have 4 (sites) * 3 (post -application samples per site) = 12 changes 
from baseline reported.  Responder status will be calculated for each reported log 10 
CFU/cm2 reduction. The sites will be considered responders based on the sample 
time and body area:  
 
For the groin at 30 seconds or 10 minutes, a log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction ≥ 3.0 is 
considered a responder. 
 
For the abdomen at 30 seconds or 10 minutes, a log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction ≥ 
2.0 is considered a responder. 
 
For either the groin or the abdomen at 6 hours, a log 10 CFU/cm2 value less 
than baseline (i.e., a log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction > 0)  is considered a responder. 
 
Responder statuses will be grouped by body area, sample time, and test substance. 
Exact confidence intervals will be calculated for responder rates.  The primary 
efficacy goal is to have the 95% confidence intervals for the responder rate at 10

  minutes  to be ≥ 70%. The secondary efficacy goals are to have the 30 second and 6 
hour 95% confidence intervals for the responder rates to be ≥ 70%.  
 
Differences in responder rates between treatments and their confidence intervals will 
be calculated using asymptotic (approximate) methods. If differences in responder 
rates are not reliable based on approximate methods, which happens when rates are 
near either 100% or 0%, log 10 CFU/cm2 confidence intervals for the differences will 
be used for comparison instead.  
 
Two-sided confidence intervals for log 10 CFU/cm2 changes from baseline will also be 
calculated. These calculations will use an ANOVA model with subject as a random 
variable and test substance as a fixed variable. Body area (abdomen or groin) will be 
a fixed variable. Sample times (30 seconds, 10 minutes, or 6 hours)  will be 
calculated separately using identical models . Differences in log 10 CFU/cm2 
reductions will be calculated based on the same model.  
 
8.2.2  Safety Analysis  
 
All treated subjects will be considered evaluable for safety. Skin irritation 
scores assessed in accordance with Appendix 14.11 will be reported for any subject who is scored with a 1 or more at any observation [baseline (screening day and treatment day), post -application/prior to 30 second , 10 
minute, or 6 hour  sampling procedures], in any category for any site.    
 Adverse events (including post treatment skin irritation scores of 3 in accordance with Appendix 14.11, will also be summarized. Summary tables 
will present incidence rates of adverse events by treatment group for all 
subjects who enter the treatment period. Listings of adverse events will be 
provided.  
 The statistical significance of differences in skin irritation between the three  
treatments will be evaluated using Fisher’s exact test on skin irritation data summarized as follows: any reaction above zero (no reaction) on the skin irritation rating scale for any category (erythema, edema, rash, and dryness) will be considered a positive signal for that substance. If Fisher’s exact test shows statistically significant skin irritation between the three treatments, a 
secondary analysis will be conducted to determine how the reactions differ.  
 
8.3 Sample Size Justification  
 
The number of subjects for the active treatments  (ZuraPrepTM and the active 
comparator) is based off of the following assumptions: the primary efficacy 
parameters are as defined above; the power is 80%; and the minimum responder 
rate for active substances is 77.8% . Using  for a single

  proportion method, this requires 267 subjects per active treatment. The number 320  
was used to make randomization blocking easier  and to be conservative. 
 
The numbers required for the inactive/negative control  group were based on results 
from . The sample size is designed to be sufficient to show there is 
a significant difference in responder rates between the active substances and 
inactive control at 30 seconds and 10 minutes  and a significant difference in log 10 
CFU/cm2 reductions from baseline at 6 hours. Based on these assumptions, the 
sample size should be at least 40. A sample size of 64 was chosen for easier 
balance of factors during randomization.    
  
 
8.4 Subject Discontinuation Criteria  
 
The Investigator may discontinue individual subjects from the study at any time.  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time. The Investigator will 
provide a written report on the appropriate CRF including the date and reason for discontinuation.     
8.5 Procedures for Accounting for Missing Data  and Protocol Deviations  
 
Missing microbiologic al data at 30 seconds, 10 minutes , or 6 hour s will be reported 
as missing ; if the entire sample is missing the site will be treated as a nonresponder 
for that sample time. These subjects will be included in the mITT  data set based on 
the criteria defined above. Details of any other missing data handling w ill be specified 
in the statistical  analysis.

  14.10  Procedure for Neutralization Validation  
 
1. Background  
 
The sampling solution, SS, sterile [75mM phosphate buffer (  
) containing  lec i thin,  Tween® 80, and 
 Tamol, ]2 is a buffered detergent solution that is commonly used in 
studies where microbial sampling of skin is conducted. Neutralizers have been added 
to inactivate the antimicrobial, isopropyl alcohol and chlorhexidine gluconate, present in test treatments. The effectiveness and toxicity of this neutralizer system must be 
assessed to demonstrate that there is no effect on the growth of microorganisms and 
that the active ingredient is inactivated.  The density of normal human skin flora generally ranges from 10
2 to 105 CFU/cm2 
depending on the body site.  However, since significant neutralizer or toxic effects are more easily detected at a lower cell density, the efficacy and toxicity of this neutralizer system will be assessed against a lower bacterial concentration.  
 This is a test where the study materials are applied to the abdomen and the treated areas will be sampled. After sampling, , a selected 
representative of normal skin flora will be added into a portion of each sample. Each sample will then be processed using procedures in accordance with ASTM E1054- 08.  
  
2. Objective  
 
This control assay will determine the ability of the SS to completely neutralize the active ingredients in the test treatments when applied to the abdomen by recovering and quantifying microorganism populations on agar media and is appropriate for antimicrobial agents that can be chemically inactivated or diluted to sub- inhibitory 
levels.   
 
3. Subject Entry Criteria  
 
subjects will be used for the neutralization validation required for this study.  Each 
subject must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 except for the baseline bacterial count, the 72-hour exclusion from 
showering/bathing and the length of the washout period. No minimum bacterial count is required and the washout period is only necessary for 7 days (not 14 days). The subjects will be asked to provide information on demographics and inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign the Consent and Authorization Forms before beginning the 7 -day 
washout period. When the subjects return to begin their participation in the study they will again be asked to provide information relative to inclusion/exclusion criteria.  If they

  meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may be enrolled. The subjects will be 
identified by the letter “N” for neutralization and a subject number of . 
 
The test, vehicle and reference control articles will be applied to the abdomen regions 
using bila teral applications so that  applications are performed for each treatment 
using bilateral application (a total of  subjects). One area will be located on one 
side of the body and the remaining area on the other side.  
 The treatments per subject will  be randomized. The randomization scheme will be 
generated before the test.  
 
4. Test Organisms  
 
The test organism s for this study are : 
 a.   
b.   
  
5. Treatment Materials  
 
a. ZuraPrep™  (containing 70% v/v Isopropyl Alcohol)  
b. ChloraPrep®  (Scrub Teal® Tint) (containing 2% chlorhexidine 
gluconate)  
c. ZuraPrep Vehicle (negative control)   
6. Materials, Supplies and Equipment  
 
See section 3.4.3 of the MBT 865-105 Protocol. In addition, 70% isopropyl alcohol 
swabs.  
 
7. In-vivo Test Procedures (collection of samples) 
 
Preparation of Test Area and Post -Prep Sampling: Neutralization samples will be 
taken from the abdomen. The subject number, location of the prep application, location of the sites sampled within the prep area, and the time of sample collection will be documented on the CRF. The subject will be treated with the study materials based on the following.  
 
• For each side of the body, mark the abdominal test areas using a sterile 2” x 
5” template. The 2” x 5” areas will be delineated with each containing one 1” x 
1” sampling site.  
• After the test areas are marked, each area will be processed using three 70% 
isopropyl alcohol swabs  for a total of one minute to prepare the site; the areas

• Prep the test areas with the appropriate treatment according to the instructions 
provided in Appendix 14.7, MBT  865-105 Protocol  for groin. 
• Using the scrub cup technique at approximately 30 seconds post-prep, begin 
collecting samples from each site using SS. This technique is described in 
Section 5.2.1 of the MBT 865-105 Protocol.  
 
8. In-vitro Test Procedures (performed using the collected samples in accordance with 
ASTM E1054 -08) 
 8.1. Inoculum Preparation:  For each test organism, the organism will be prepared 
from and overnight broth culture (24 ± 4 hours) grown in TSB at 35 ± 2C to yield a concentration of approximately   CFU/mL.  The culture will be diluted 
using PBW in a m
anner such that  CFU/mL will be delivered into the 
neutralizer tube (a  aliquot of the collected SS sample will be used).   
 8.2 Test: 
(note – the reference to test article applies to test article, the vehicle  and the reference  
control article; all procedures outlined, where applicab le will employ all articles.)  
 
 8.2.1    Neutralizer effectiveness (Test 1) : 
 
a. Out of the  aliquot of sampling solution taken from the volunteer,  
will be transferred to a new sterile tube and inoculated with the challenge 
microorganism so that the final concentration will equal  colony -
forming units (CFU) / mL of the challenge microorganism (the prepared inoculum will b e diluted using PBW to achieve the desired concentration, a 
 aliquot from the  dilution will be used). 
b. Within one min after 
 the addition of the challenge microorganism, the 
microorganisms will be enumerated by standard microbiological methods extant in the laboratory.  
c. Duplicate   aliquots will be removed and plated using TSA+N pour 
plates.  
d. After 30 minutes, the microorganisms will be enumerated a second time using the same procedures.  
e. Duplicate   aliquots will be removed and plated usi ng TSA+N pour 
plates.  
8.2.2   Neutralizer toxicity (Test 2) : 
 
a. A  aliquot of sampling solution will be inoculated with the challenge 
microorganism so that the final concentration will equal  colony -
forming units (CFU) / mL of the challenge microorganism in the same manner

b. Within one min after the addition of the challenge microorganism, the 
microorganisms will be enumerated by standard microbiological methods 
extant in the laboratory.  
c. Duplicate   aliquots will be removed and plated using TSA+N   pour 
plates.  
d. After 30 minutes, the microorganisms will be enumerated a second time using the same procedures.  
e. Duplicate   aliquots will be removed and plated using TSA+N pour 
plates.  
f. This procedure will be repeated two times for a total  of three replicates.  
 
8.2.3  Test microorganism viability control (Test 3) : 
 
a. A  aliquot of PBW will be inoculated with a volume of the challenge 
microorganism so that the resulting suspension contains  CFU/mL in 
the same manner as Test 1.  
b. Within one min the microorganisms will be enumerated (in triplicate) by 
standard microbiological methods extant in the laboratory.  
c. Duplicate   aliquots will be removed and plated using TSA pour plates.  
d. After 30 minutes, the microorganisms will be enumerated a second time 
using the same procedures.  
e. Duplicate   aliquots will be removed and plated using TSA pour plates.  
f. This procedure will be repeated two times for a total of three replicates.  
 
8.2.4  Test article control (Test 4) : 
 
a. A  aliquot of the test or control article will be inoculated with a volume of the challenge microorganism so that the resulting suspension contains  
CFU/mL in the same manner as Test 1.  
b. Within one min the microorganisms will be enumerated (in triplicate ) by 
standard microbiological methods extant in the laboratory.  
c. Duplicate   aliquots   will be removed and plated using TSA pour plates.  
d. After 30 minutes, the microorganisms will be enumerated a second time using the same procedures.  
e. Duplicate   aliquots   will be removed and plated using TSA pour plates.  
f. This procedure will be repeated two times for a total of three replicates.

  8.3.  Incubation:  
 
 All plates for Tests 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be incubated for 48±2 hours at 35° ±2°C. 
 
8.4. Interpretation of data:  
 
a. The number of surviving challenge microorganisms for each replicate from each 
test will be average count of the three plates.    
b. The number of survivor values will be transformed to log 10. 
c. The number of survivors (log 10) from each test (1, 2, and 4) will be compared to 
the test microorganism viability population (test 3).  
d.  Neutralization aspects of the sampling solution will be considered adequate if the 
mean log 10 CFU/mL of Test 1 is not more than 0.20 log 10 less than the mean 
log 10 CFU/mL of Test 3 (Mean l og10 CFU/mL from Test 3 – Mean log 10 CFU/mL 
from Test 1 using corresponding time points). 
e. The sampling solution will be considered non- toxic if the mean log 10 CFU/mL of 
Test 2 is not more than 0.20 log 10 less than the mean log 10 CFU/mL of Test 3 
(Mean l og10 CFU/mL from Test 3 − Mean log 10 CFU/mL from Test 2 using 
corresponding time points). 
f. The mean log 10 CFU/mL from Test 4 must be at least 0.20 log 10 less than the 
mean log 10 CFU/mL of Test 3.  
g. The amount of CFU added for each aspect must be confirmed to yield a  final 
suspension containing /mL (validated in test 3).  
h. The sterility controls must be negative for growth.  
  
 
8.5. Controls:  
 
8.5.1  Sterility control: 
 
Triplicate  plates of TSA and TSA+N used will be incubated with the test. In 
addition, triplicate   aliquots of sampling solution and PBW will be plated 
using TSA pour plates used for a particular test date. All plates will be incubated 
with the test.  
 
8.5.2   Challenge microorganism confirmation:  
 
In order to confirm growth consistent with the challenge microorganism, Gram stains will be performed from a representative colony from a test plate. The colony morphology will be noted as well.

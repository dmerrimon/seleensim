2011N118599_01 2012 -JAN-09Amendment No. 1
Amendment 1 applies to all study  sites.  Modifications include updated medical 
monito ring information due to a personnel change on the GSK team. In addition, the 
following review of the protocol by  the FDA, the following changes are made: For Part 1, 
the starting dose of GSK525762 is reduced from 5 mg/day  to 2 mg/day . Cardiac troponin 
T level assessments are required as a part of the inclusion criteria and thereafter.   An 
observation of CTCAE Grade 2 drug related toxicity , including grade 2 troponin T 
elevation, in one subject will end accelerated dose titration in Part 1.  Subjects with a
history  of gastrointestinal bleeding or active bleeding (positive guaiac fecal occult blood 
monitoring) will be excluded.  In addition, wording for dose escalation decisions has 
been modified to state that no more than a 2 -fold increase in dose will occur between 
successive cohorts.  A staggered dosing approach will be implemented in the 3+3 dosing 
design to minimize potential for toxicity  in multiple subjects. Alternative dosing 
regimens will not be implemented without consultation with FDA and a protocol
amendment.  For Part 2 of the trial, stopping rules based on lack of efficacy and the 
futility  rule have been modified. Additionally  the disease assessment scans may  be 
reviewed retrospectivel y by an independent radiologist.  Finall y, multiple Time and 
Event Tables have been revised for consistency  across Part 1 and Part 2 of the protocol.
2011N118599_02 2012- AUG -29Amendment No. 2
Amendment 02 applies to all study  sites.  Changes via Amendment 02 include the 
addition of subjects with tumor ty pes other t han NMC [including multiple my eloma 
(MM), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), and 
any solid tumor that demonstrates N -Myc amplification or over expression (such as 
NSCL C with N -myc amplification)] and associated chan ges in the study  design and 
inclusion criteria; definition of adult subjects as those 16 and older; addition of pediatric 
subjects 1
2 to ≤15 y ears old; modification of the initial staggered dosing schedule to 
shorten the dose escalation period from 6 weeks to 4 weeks; allowance for treatment 
beyond tumor progression (decision made in consultation with GSK Medical Monitor); 
minor clarif ications to the Risk Assessment section; updates to Exploratory 
Objectives/Endpoints to ensure adequate assessment of the effect of drug on tumor 
biology ; and addition of drug preparation guidelines for GSK525762 administered via an 
enteral feeding tube.
2011N118599_03 2014 -FEB-04Amendment No. 03

Amendment 4 applies to all study  sites and includes the addition of subjects with the 
following solid tumor types: castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative 
breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (ER positive), and non -
small cell lung cancer (NSCL C).  Multiple m yeloma (MM), a haematological malignancy 
previously  included in the trial, is now remove d from this trial as it is included in a 
separate trial open for hematologic malignancies with dose escalation to better define the 
benefit/risk balance. Additional details of twice daily  (BID) dosing during dose escalation 
have been included. A Besy late S ub-Study  has been added to determine the relative 
bioavailability  (BA), food effect, and dose proportionality  of the bes ylate formulation of 
GSK525762 at or near the MTD. An update to inclusion criteria has been made to allow 
subjects with evaluable diseas e to be enrolled in the NMC PD cohort. An updated 
imaging schedule for NMC subjects has been included.
2011N118599_05 2015- MAR - 24 Amendment No. 5
Amendment 5 applies to all study  sites and includes the following additional expansion 
cohorts for Part 2 of the trial: castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative 
breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (ER positive) and small 
cell lung cancer (SCLC). An update was included regarding the Bes ylate Sub- Study  to 
clarify  that this sub -study would only  be conducted at centers in the United States. The

19STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION : This study is divided into 2 parts: 
Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and select a recommended dose for Part 2 or a 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on the safet y, pharmacokinetic, 
and pharmacod ynamic profiles observed after oral administration of 
GSK525762. Eligible subjects with NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), small 
cell lung cancer (SCL C), non -small cell lung cancer (NSCL C), colorectal 
cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive 
(ER positive) breast cancer, and an y other MYCN -amplified solid tumor will
be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until a maximum toler ated dose (MTD) is 
established. Subjects with NMC will also be enrolled in a pharmacod ynamic 
dose e xpansion cohort during Part 1. Subjects may continue treatment in the 
study  until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal of 
consent.   
Part 1 besy late sub -study will explore the relative bioavailability, food effect 
and dose proportionalit y of bes ylate formulation. The sub- study  will be 
conducted at active centers in the United States in subjects eligible for Part 1 
at the MTD or a dose near the MTD or RP2D. This will be an open -label, 
randomized, single dose, four period, cross over sub- study  to investigate the 
relative bioavailabilit y of the besylate tablet compared to the amorphous f ree-
base tablet, the effect of high -fat high -calorie meal on the bioavailability  of 
the besy late tablet and the dose proportionalit y of two doses of GSK525762 
administered as bes ylate tablets.
Part 2 is an expansion cohort planned to further explore clinic al activity  at the 
MTD in NMC, SCL C, CRPC, TN BC, ER positive BC and GI ST subjects.
Duration of stud y will depend on recruitment rates, and timing of subjects’ 
duration on study  (withdrawal rates due to toxicity  or progression).
SUBJECT SAMPLE : Worldwide ap proximately  110 subjects will be enrolled 
in Part 1, and approximately  170 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. 
DOSAGE/DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE AND DOSE REGIMEN : Starting dose 
will be 2 mg, orall y (tablets), once a day. Dose escalations will be performed in 
Part 1 and dose adjustments are allowed to address tolerability  and safet y issues. 
Alternate dosing schedules (BID or intermittent dosing) may  be used based on 
PK and safet y. 
PHARMACOKINETIC/PHARMACODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS : 
There is extensive pharmacokinetic (P K) sampling in Part 1 and limited PK 
sampling in Part 2 for this study . Single safet y PK blood draws may  be collected 
for subjects with severe adverse events or adverse events of concern. Blood 
samples will be collected for anal ysis of protein biomarkers ( cytokines and acute 
phase proteins) and mRNA. Ex -vivo L PS induction of cy tokines in whole blood 
will be assessed. In addition, pre
-treatment and post -treatment tumor samples 
will also be collected from selected subjects to be evaluated for target 
engagement and effects of GSK525762 on tumor biology . 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
20EFFICACY MEASUREMENTS : Response Rate (RR), Disease Control Rate 
(DCR), PSA50 response rate, Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall 
Survival (OS), time to response and duration of response. 
SAFETY MEASUREM ENTS : Routine phy sical examinations, vital sign 
measurements, echocardiograms, and monitoring of adverse events. Cardiac 
safet y monitoring will be required, consisting of triplicate 12-lead ECGs in Part 
1 prior to dosing on selected day s and prior to drawi ng PK samples on serial PK 
sampling day s (overnight stay s in research facility  may  be necessary  in Part 1) . 
Extensive laboratory  testing includes, in addition to standard hematology , 
clinical chemistry , pancreatic, coagulation, and liver chemistry  panels, 
testing 
for troponin, c -peptide, 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5 AG), HbA1c, and thy roid 
monitoring. Additional safet y assessments may be necessary if a combination 
treatment regimen is administered to address specific safet y concerns with the 
other agent(s) being administered.
DATA ANALYSIS : Subject demographic and safety  data will be collected on 
electronic case report forms (eCRFs). All data will be pooled and descriptive 
safet y analyses summarized and listed by cohort at conclusion of Part 2 
expansion cohorts. Additional anal yses may  occur between Part 1 and Part 2 and 
details will be included in the Reporting Anal ysis Plan (RAP). Part 2 of the 
study  is powered to test overall Response Rate (RR). A futility  assessment will 
be conducted after data are available from the first 10 subjects in each expansion 
cohort in Part 2.

211. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Bromodomains : Bromodomains ( BRDs) are small protein domains found in a variet yof 
proteins that recognize and bind to acet ylated histone tails. This binding affects 
chromatin structure, and thereby  regulates epigenetically  controlled processes including 
gene transcription and mRNA elongation [ Nicodeme , 2010; French , 2008]. The 
bromodomain extr a-terminal (BET) famil y of bromodomain proteins includes the BRD2, 
BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT [testes] proteins. 
Investigational Product : GSK525762 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that is a 
potent inhibitor of the binding of BET proteins to acet ylated histones. Binding of 
GSK525762 induces squamous differentiation and inhibits proliferation of patient -
derived NMC cell lines both in culture and in murine xenografts. The phenoty pic changes 
induced in vitro (flattening, keratin production, and the loss of p roliferation markers) 
persist for more than 2 weeks after washout of GSK525762.
Nonclinical data suggest a narrow therapeutic window relative to reproductive, cardiac, 
and gastrointestinal toxicities which may  be observed clinically  with GSK525762 (see 
Section 1.5). However, the major cardiac and gastrointestinal toxicities observed in the 
animal studies can be clinically  monitored and are largel y reversible.
1.2. Stud y Population Rationale
1.2.1. NUT midline carcinoma
Nucle ar protein in testis (NUT) midline carcinoma (NMC) is a newl y described 
aggressive carcinoma that arises from a NUT gene translocation that generates a fusion 
protein with BRD proteins (BRD4 or BRD3) that is retained strictl y in the cell nucleus 
via intera ctions with chromatin [ Stelow , 2008; 
French , 2004]. NMC is a poorly  
differentiated malignant neoplasm, often with squamous differentiation, without 
pathognomonic features. As a n ewly described disease, and without specific histology , it 
is not surprising that NMC is often not diagnosed, or mistaken for other entities, 
including th ymic carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, lung 
carcinoma, and Ewing sarcoma. NMCs are invariably  lethal and despite aggressive 
chemotherapeutic regimens, subjects have a median life expectancy  of onl y 6.7 months 
(N=63 patients) [ Bauer , 2012].
Functional studies in subject- derived NMC cell lines have validated the essential role of 
the BRD4 –NUT oncoprotein in maintaining the characteristic proliferation advantage and 
differentiation block of this uniformly  fatal malignancy . The siRNA -mediated BRD 
knockdown arrests the proliferation and prompts termina l squamous differentiation in 
subject -derived NMC cells [ French , 2008]. Additionally , BET inhibitors induce 
differentiation and growth arrest in NMC, and possess anti
-tumor activity in NMC mouse 
xenograft models [ Filippakopoulos, 2010].
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
22NMC tumors may  occur in multiple organ sites and are histologicall y indistinguishable 
from other undifferentiated squamous cell carcinomas. Subjects for the study  will be 
selected based on the ectopic expression of NUT protein by  Immunohistochemistry  
(IHC) [ Haack , 2009] rather than on tumor histopathology  or organ site. Fluorescence in 
situ hy bridization (FISH) can also be used as a method to detect the pre sence of BRD -
NUT fusion protein in NMC diagnosis. However, due to the fast progression of NMC, 
there is a practical limitation to the extent of FI SH testing that can be completed, 
especiall y for delineating cry ptic BRD rearrangements, prior to patient incl usion. 
Recent studies have delineated the NUT variant sub population (n=4) through bespoke 
FISH experiments to, in all but one case, a cryptic rearrangement of the BRD3 locus. 
Retrospective analy sis of the survival data observed in the NUT variant sub-pop ulation 
has indicated there is no apparent difference in progression free or overall survival based 
on this variant diagnosis compared to BRD4 or BRD3.
NMC is extremely  rare with approximately  20 cases being reported in the United States 
annually , however due to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis, the exact incidence and 
frequency  of NMC are not well established (http://www.nmcregistry .org/). NMC may  
affect subjects of all ages (age range 0 -78 yrs). The only  known long
-term survivor had a 
complete tumor resecti on. Therefore, patients with this rare tumor have a significant 
unmet medical need for more effective therap y.
1.2.2. Other tumor types
Recently  published data as well as data generated internally  at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) 
and by  collaborators have demonstrated th e potential application of BRD extra -terminal
(BET) inhibitors in tumor ty pes other than NMC, including small cell lung cancer 
(SCL C), non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), castration 
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC);  estrogen 
receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer, neuroblastoma (NB), acute leukemias, 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GI ST), and other N -Myc driven tumors. Studies in 
leukemia and 
Multiple Myeloma (MM) have shown that small molecule inhibition of 
BET protein binding to chromatin can directly  block both c -Myc expression and its 
downstream transcriptional functions, resulting in significant anti -tumor effects 
[Delmore , 2011; Mertz , 2011]. My c famil y proteins play a central role in the regulation 
of gene expression and cell cy cle control. Their enhanced expression has been implicated 
in all aspects of tumor cell biology  [Adhikary , 2005]. 
Based on the preclinical findings within GSK and with collaborators, subjects with small 
cell lung cancer, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, castration 
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor 
positive (ER positive) breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and N- Myc amplified solid tumors 
will be enrolled to the dose finding part of the study . In addition, Part 2 expansion cohorts 
will enrol subjects with NMC, SCL C, CRPC, TNBC, ER+BC and GIST.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
GSK525762 was found to inhibit growth in a subset of SCL C cell lines, with 46% (18 of 
39) of cell lines possessing a gI C50< 1 µM. I t was confirmed in several of the cell lines 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
23that apoptosis (assessed by  caspas e cleavage) is induced at concentrations above the 
gIC 100.  Additionally , significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in a subset of cell 
line and patient -derived subcutaneous xenograft models of SCL C. 
No correlation between status of c -Myc or L -Myc and sensitivity  was found. N -Myc 
amplified cell lines were found to be sensitive, though the low number (N=2) of lines 
tested with this amplification does not allow for a firm conclusion to be drawn. Although 
no predictive marker of GSK525762 sensitivity  in SCL C has been identified and 
considering the high percentage of cell lines that are sensitive, enrolment will be opened 
to all relapsed refractory  SCL C patients in the dose escalation part of the study  while 
collecting data retrospectively  on potential predictive biomarkers from the available 
tissues.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
GSK525762 inhibited cell growth in a subset of NSCL
C cell lines, with 46% (33/72) of 
cell lines tested exhibiting a gI C50 <1µM. Median gIC 50 across the NSCL C cell line panel 
was 1. 1µM. MYCN amplified cell lines and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma 
(LCNEC) cell lines were among the most sensitive to GSK525762, with a median gI C50 
of 0.17
µM and 0.24µM (n=4 for each sub -type). A subset of NSCL C cell lines, including 
MYCN -amplified a nd LCNEC lines, exhibited a cy totoxic response to GSK525762. 
Given the broad sensitivity  of NSCL C cell lines to GSK525762, a selection marker will 
not be used for entry  into the dose escalation part of the study .
Colorectal Cancer
In colorectal cell lines, initial data using the same criterion of sensitivity  indicates that 
GSK525762 inhibits growth in a high percentage of lines tested (58%, 25/43 with gIC 50< 
1µM). No markers of sensitivity  in these lines has been identified yet and, as with SCL C, 
enrolment will be opened to all relapsed refractory CRC patients without a selection 
marker in an initial clinical trial.
Neuroblastoma
NB cell lines are sensitive to GSK525762, with 83% of cell lines tested (15/18) 
exhibiting a gIC 50< 1µM. Median gIC 50 across th e NB cell line panel was 0.48 µM, with a 
subset of cell lines exhibiting a cy
totoxic response to GSK525762. The agent is sensitive 
in MYCN amplified cell lines, as 10 of the 15 sensitive cell lines possess the co py number 
increase. As with SCL C, NSCL C, and CRC, a selection marker will not be used in NB 
patients for entry  into the dose escalation part of the study .
Castration -Resistant Prostate Cancer
A subset of prostate cancer cell lines were found to be sensitive to GSK525762, with 
57% (4/7) of cell lines exhibiting a gIC 50 <1µM. Apoptosis was observed in a subset of 
prostate cancer cell lines as measured b y poly ADP ribose poly merase (PARP) cleavage 
and accumulation of cells in sub
-G1 phase of cell cy cle. Prostate cancer lines cell lines, 
including models of CRPC, with high androgen receptor (AR) and high c- Myc protein 
expression were found to be the most sensitive (lowest gI C50) to GSK525762A. 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
24Consistent with in vitro observations, significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in 
a subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft model of CRPC expressing high levels of AR
and MYC . In contrast, no significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in a second 
model expressing low levels of ARand MYC . Given the limited availability  of pre -
clinical prostate models and the broad sensitivity  of prostate cancer cell lines to 
GSK525762, no selection marker will be used for entry  into the dose escalation part of 
the study .
Triple Negative and ER -positive Breast Cancer
A subset of breast cancer cell lines representing the ER-positive and triple negative sub -
types were found to be sensitive to GSK525762, with 55% (17/31) cell lines tested 
exhibiting a gIC 50< 1µM. Median gIC 50 across the breast cancer cell line panel was 
980nM, with a subset of cell lines exhibiting a cy totoxic response to GSK525762. 
The activity  observed with GSK525762 in ER+ breast cancer cell lines is consistent with 
data reported in two recent publications using the tool BET inh
ibitor JQ1 [ Feng Q, 2014; 
Nagarajan, 2014]. Given the broad activity  of BET inhibitors across the ER+ and triple 
negative subty pes, no selection marker will be used for entry  into the dose escalation part 
of the study  for ER -positive and TNBC patients.
N-Myc amplified solid tumors
A large majorit y of N -Myc amplified cell lines from various tumor ty pes, including 
SCLC, NSCL C, and neuroblastoma, are highl y sensitive to GSK525762. Across the three 
tumor ty pes, 16 of 19 (84%) MYCN -amplified cell lines poss ess a gI C50< 1µM, and 11 of 
19 (58%) exhibit a cy totoxic response to GSK525762. Expression of MYCN was 
suppressed b y GSK525762 in SCL C and NB cell lines, which is consistent with 
published reports [ Puissant , 2013; 
Wyce, 2013]. 
Given the high percentage of responsive cell lines in small cell lung cancer, non -small 
cell lung cancer, colorectal, castration -resistant prostate cancer, triple -negative breast 
cancer, ER -positive breast cancer, and neuroblastoma it is appropriate to include 
refractory  patients who have failed prior treatments regimens into the dose escalation 
phase of this study  where this medicine may  prolong survival. In addition subjects with 
any solid tumor that demo nstrates N -Myc amplification will be eligible for the dose 
escalation phase of the study .
GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor )
The super -
enhancer profiling of sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines identified 
conserved super -enhancer program in GIST tumors. Some of the genes associated with 
super -enhancers in GIST tumors include well -established drivers, such as KITand 
PDGFRA, but also potential novel targets, such as ETV1 and HAND1. GIST -specific KIT
super -enhancer regulating KITgene activity  is remarkabl y sensitive to bromodomain 
inhibition. KIT -dependent GI ST cell lines have an IC50 to the protot ypical bromodomain 
inhibitor, JQ1, ranging from 150 – 470nM (Matthew Hemming, personal communication, 
December 2016) . Other bromodomain inhibitors, including GSK525762, demonstrate 
similar selective toxicity  in KI T
-dependent GIST cell lines. At the gene and protein

25expression levels, BET bromodomain inhibitors attenuate the expression of genes, 
associated with superenhancers, such as KIT, ETV1 and HAND1, suggesting that BET 
proteins are required for the maintenance of GI ST super -enhancer associated 
transcriptional program and are critical regulators of GI ST growth and survival. I n 
support of this mechanism, uncoupling KITexpression from its native super- enhancer 
leads to resistance to bromodomain inhibition. I n KIT -dependent GIST cells, 
bromodomain inhibition shows sy nergistic toxicity  with KIT -inhibition, further 
suggesting an independent and complimentary  mechanism of action in GIST (Matthew 
Hemming, personal com munication, December 2016) .These evolving data have driven 
strong enthusiasm in developing bromodomain inhibitors in GI ST. 
1.3. Dose Rationale
1.3.1. Human Pharmacokinetics
Whole blood human clearance was predicted from three species (mouse, rat and dog) 
using simpl e power -law allometry  (in the absence of detectable in vitro metabolism) to be 
2.8 mL /min/kg. Volume of distribution was predicted from Gastroplus to be 2.6 L /kg and 
half-life 10 hours (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2010N108204_00 , 2011). As the 
in vitro blood to plasma ratio was 0.86, a 70 kg adult therefore had a predicted total 
clearance of 10.1 L/hr and a total plasma volume of distribution of 157 L .
Information on t he pharmacokinetics of GSK525762 in humans can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure ( GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 
2011N113741_05, 2016). 
In summary , GSK525762 pharmacokinetics are characterized by  a rapid absorption with 
maximum concentration occurring mostly  within the first hour after dosing. GSK525762 
is eliminated rapidly  with an average terminal phase half -life of 3 to 7 hours, leading to a 
lack of accumulation following once dail
y oral administration. Following single oral 
administration and repeated once d aily administration of 2 mg to 100 mg of GSK525762, 
Maximum observed concentrations (Cmax)and Area under concentration -time curve
(AUC) tended to increase in a dose proportional fashion with a 
large overlap for 
individual AUC between 30 , 60, 80 and 100 mgcohorts. 
1.3.2. Starting dose
Four approaches have been considered to establish the starting dose for GSK525762:
One tenth of the rat 10% mortality  over the duration of the study  (STD) 10 as per 
International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirement s for 
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S9 guidance
For GSK525762, the STD10 was defined as 30 mg/kg in the rat following ICH S9 
guidelines. 1/10 rat STD10 is 18 mg/m2; this dose is not severel y toxic to dogs; therefore 
starting dose is 1 /10 rat STD10 which translates to a starting dose in man of 30 mg, 
assuming a 70 kg adult and adult surface area of 1.7 m2. 
One sixth of the dog Highest non
-severel y toxic dose ( HNSTD) as per ICH S9 
guidance
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
26Based on tolerability  and QT prolongation, the HNSTD was defined as 0.3 mg/kg in the 
dog. 1/6 dog HNSTD is 1 mg/m2which translates to a starting dose in man of 1.7 mg 
(rounded to a starting dose of 2 mg based on tablet strength), assuming a 70 kg adult and 
adult surface area of 1.7 m2.
Average exposur e at the QTc NOEL in the dog 
Average exposure at the QTc NOEL (0.3 mg/kg) was as follows: AUC 642 ng.hr/ml 
(total), 167 ng.hr/ml (free), Cmax 80 ng/ml (total), 20.8 ng/ml (free). Extrapolating the 
AUC to humans, the dose required for parity  is given by  Dose = AUC x CL/Fu, where Fu 
is fraction unbound in humans (22%). Using this expression, the predicted starting dose 
would be 167 ng.hr/ml x 11.8 (L /hr)/0.22 = 9 mg, assuming 100% absolute 
bioavailability . Using an absorption rate of 1/hr predicted from Gast roplus, the predicted 
free drug Cmax is 8.2 ng/ml.
The dose predicted to deliver a Cmax of less than the I C20 for the most sensitive 
known human pharmacology  (Minimum anticipated biological effect level
[MABEL ] dose)
The most sensitive human pharmacology  is defined as the inhibition of growth in patient 
derived NMC cells. Free drug IC50 is approximately  40 ng/ml with maximal inhibition at 
1000 ng/ml. I C20 for this pharmacology , defined as MABEL, is 10 ng/ml. The dose to 
achieve this MABEL concentration at C max is 11mg (MABEL dose).
Taking all four approaches into consideration, a starting dose of 2 mg is proposed. This 
dose will provide a 5 -fold safet y margin to the QTc prolongation observed on repeat 
dosing in the dog. Table 1provides the predicted safet y cover for the proposed 2 mg 
starting dose.

281.3.3. Predicted therapeutic dose range
The potential therapeutic dose for GSK525762 in human was derived using available 
preclinical PK, in vitro data, and efficacy  data f rom several tumor xenograft studies. 
Based on modeling, maximal efficacy  of GSK525762 may  require ≥ 50% target 
inhibition. The predicted human effective daily dose is 25 to 100 mg assuming 50 to 
100% oral bioavailability.
1.3.4. Dose escalation steps
Human PK predictions suggest t hat exceeding the sy stemic exposure of the preclinical 
4week MTD (1 mg/kg in dogs and 10 mg/kg in rats) may  be required to achieve ≥ 50% 
target inhibition in the majority  of subjects. The start of the predicted therapeutic range in 
humans is at parity  with the 4 week MTD exposure range in preclinical species. The 
toxicities observed at exposures greater than the preclinical MTD are clinically  
monitorable and largely  reversible (excluding testicular effects), therefore semi -semi -log 
(≤ 2-fold) dose escalation above this preclinical MTD, conditional on acceptable 
tolerability , is permitted until the clinical MTD is established. 
1.3.5. BID Dose Cohort
1.3.5.1. Preclinical Rationale
Pre-clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynam ic data suggests a potential benefit of a 
BID do sing regimen compared to QD dosing. In mice, GSK525762 has a short half -life 
of about 1.5 hours. Single dose pharmacod ynamic experiments were performed in three 
SCLC and one CRC mouse xenograft model. Dose -dependent changes in gene expression 
were observed in all models at earl y time points post -dose; however, expression returned 
to pre -treatment levels within 8 -12 hours. Additionally, in a subcutaneous multiple 
myeloma cell line xenograft study , c-Myc protein levels were significantl y reduced 2 and 
5 hours post-dose, and returned to baseline b y 8 hours. The transient effects on gene 
expression observed in these studies with QD dosing highlights the potential benefit of 
BID dosing b y extending the duration of gene silencing within a 24 hour period.
QD and BID dosing have been further explored in efficacy  studies in the above -
mentioned SCL C and CRC xenograft models. In a subcutaneous, patient- derived model 
of SCL C, BID dosing at 12.5mg/kg resulted in improved tumor growth inhibition 
compared to 25 mg/kg QD (74 % versus 60%, respectivel y).  Improved efficacy with BID 
dosing was also observed in the cell line xenograft model of CRC. BID dosing at 
12.5 mg/kg resulted in 48% tumor growth inhibition, whereas 25 mg/kg QD dosing 
resulted in 34% inhibition.  I n a third model, a cell line xenograft of SCL C, there was no 
significant difference in tumor growth inhibition resulting from 12.5mg/kg BID versus 
25mg/kg QD dosing. Thus, we observed equivalent or improved efficacy  with BID 
dosing in all xenograft models tested.
1.3.5.2. Clinical Rationale
Based on the pharmacokinetics of GSK525762 observed to date, with  the short half -life 
of about 5 hours, it is predicted that even 100 mg QD doses would result in the trough 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
29concentrations falling below the average in vitro IC50 (0.08 uM t o 1.3 uM) for the tumor 
types selected for this study . Dividing the dail y dose into two doses administered about 
12 hours apart would maintain the concentrations above the lower in vitro IC50 for doses 
around 30 mg BID.  
1.3.6. Doses for Besy late Bioavailability /Food Effect/Dose 
Proportionality  Sub -Study
A dose at or near the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended Phase 2 dose will be 
used to evaluate the relative bioavailability  of the besy late salt tablet compared to the 
amorphous free -base tablet.
As GSK525762 is a compound with high solubility  but low permeability , it is expected 
that administration with food will have no effect or possibly  a negative effect on its 
absorption [ C-H Gu , 2007] and a dose at or near the MTD or RP2D will be used to 
evaluate the effect of food on the relative BA of GSK525762 administered as the bes ylate 
salt tablet.  
In addition, to evaluate the dose proportionalit y of the PK of GSK525762 after fasted 
administration as besy late salt tablet, a lo wer dose of half to one -third of the MTD or 
RP2D will be evaluated. 
1.4. Rationale for Study  and Endpoints
Safety  and efficacy  (RR) are being assessed to address the primary  objectives of the 
study . The safet y assessments along with the PK will be important fo r determining the 
MTD of once daily  and/or twice dail y dosing. The pharmacod ynamic assessments will 
further support the recommended Phase II doses (RP2D) and expand the understanding 
regarding mechanism of action. The response rate hurdle of 20% in NMC was
determined based on 3 parameters: NMC is a rare population, there is currently  no 
standard of care therap y for NMC, and NMC carries a poor prognosis (median survival of 
6.7 months [ Bauer, 2012].
Given the poor prognosis and high unmet medical need of NMC, as well as in other 
tumor ty pes such as relapsed/refractory  SCL C, NSCL C,CRC, CRPC, TN and ER+ BC, 
GIST, NB and N-Myc amplified tumors and the exceptional drug- to- target alignment of 
GSK525762, a combined Phase I/II study (BET115521) is proposed. The BET115521 
study  comprises an accelerated dose titration (Part 1), which will include subjects with 
NMC and other tumor types that are predicted to be responsive to GSK525762, to 
determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The besy late sub -study  will be an open -
label, randomized, single dose, four period, crossover sub -study  to investigate the relative 
bioavailability  of the besy late salt tablet compared to the amorphous free -base tablet at a 
dose at or near the MTD or RP2D, t he effect of high -fat high- calorie meal on the 
bioavailability  of the besylate salt tablet at or near the MTD or RP2D and the dose 
proportionality  of two doses of GSK525762 administered as bes ylate salt tablets. Results 
of the bes ylate sub- study  will enabl e the use of the besy late salt tablet formulation later in 
this study  and provide recommendation around the need for fasting status when 
administering GSK525762. The bes ylate sub- study  will be conducted at centers in the 
United States.  
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
30The recommended ph ase II dose (RP2D) of GSK525762 with possible adjustment based 
on the relative bioavailability  of the bes ylate salt formulation, will be studied in the 
cohort expansion (Part 2) to determine efficacy , safety  and tolerability  in NMC and other 
tumor ty pesincluding SCL C, CRPC, TNBC, ER+BC and GI ST.
1.5. Risk Assessment
Toxicology  studies performed in dogs, rats and mice suggest that the primary  toxicities of 
GSK525762 are gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pancreatic, hematologic and 
reproductive (see GlaxoSmithKli neDocument Number 2011N113741_05, 2016 , Section 
3.4). These toxicities are addressed below, together with the proposed safety  monitoring 
and risk mitigation activities that are included in the planned study .
Gastrointestinal: Evidence of degeneration/regeneration and/or erosion/ulceration in the 
gastrointestinal tract was seen at non -tolerated doses in 7 and 14 day  studies in rat and 
dog, respectivel y.  Microscopic examination included degenerative changes in the 
esophagus, st omach, small and large intestine, including erosion or ulceration, mucosal 
congestion, hemorrhage and edema, cry pt dilatation and focal inflammatory  cell 
infiltration in the toxicology studies of up to 3 month duration in the dog and rat. 
Recovery  was evident after a minimum of 3 weeks off dose . During clinical studies, 
medical history , phy sical examination (including weight) and clinical laboratory  
assessments will be used to identify  and assess toxicity  in the GI tract.  Supportive 
therap y will be provided as per standard medical practice.  In the event of clinically  
significant toxicity , treatment will be withheld and supportive therap y provided according 
to standard medical practice.
Cardio- vascular:  Although there were minimal effects of GSK525762 on current 
density  and no effects on trafficking in HEK- 293 cells or on ECG rhy thms or arrh ythmias 
in the ex vivo rabbit wedge assay , QT and QTc prolongation (maximum 41 milliseconds 
at 3 mg/kg for 12 day s) was seen 
in dogs after a single oral dose of 30 mg/k g or repeat 
dosing at  1mg/kg/day in toxicology  studies of up to 3 month duration.  No effect was 
seen in the dog at 0.3 mg/kg (6 mg/m2) where exposure is estimated to be approximately  
equivalent to that achieved by  a 10 mg dose in humans if 100% bioavail ability  is 
assumed.  However, the starting dose in this First time in humans (FTIH) study is 2 mg.  
Increases in biomarkers of cardiac damage (cardiac troponin I and T, m yosin light chain
and NT- proANP ) were also seen in the rat and cardiac troponin I in the dog.  Despite 
these QTc and cardiac biomarker changes, there was no evidence of compound -related 
myocardial necrosis or other histopathological changes in cardiac tissue of either species.  
No significant arrh ythmias were detected in preclinical studies . 
Given the risks of long QTc associated arrh ythmias, and of compound associated 
cardiom yopath y, subjects will be monitored closely for changes in QTc with triplicate 
12-lead ECGand for elevations in plasma Troponin.  I npatient 48 -hour telemetry  was 
origi nally required for all subjects following the first dose of study drug, as part of the 
cardiac monitoring. Evaluation of cardiac safet y data from subjects treated up to the 100 
mg QD cohort b y the cut -off date of May  15, 2015 demonstrated no significant Q Tc 
prolongation after single and repeat dose administration. Therefore, the 48 -hour telemetry  
requirement was removed and the frequency
 of Holter monitoring was reduced with 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
31Protocol Amendment 6 and upon further review of the totality  of data, Holter monit oring 
was removed in Amendment 9. Specific stopping criteria and management guidelines are 
provided for cardiac toxicities.
Electrol ytes, including potassium and magnesium will be checked at baseline and at 
regular intervals or when clinically  indicated. Appropriate medical management will be 
instituted to assure that electrol ytes are kept within the normal range.
Safety ECGs
Safety  ECGs will be performed at the time points specified in Time and Events Tables 
using a standard 12 -lead ECG machine that automatically  calculates the HR and 
measures PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals. The mean from triplicate ECGs (when 
indicated) will be evaluated at each time point. Safety  ECGs will be reviewed by  the 
investigator and a Cardiologist on an ongoing basis for safety purposes and will be over -
read at a central site (eRT). The dosing for each new week in the first cy cle should not 
begin until the safet y ECG has been reviewed and no significant abnormalities have been 
detected.
Serum Markers 
In addition to the safet y ECGs performed during the study , laboratory evaluations for 
cardiac troponins and electroly tes will be performed and NT
-pro-brain natriuretic peptide 
(BNP) will be checked at baseline, regular intervals (as specified in the Time and E vents
Tables), and when clinically  warranted during the study  treatment.  Troponin I  or T 
(based on availability ) levels will be tested by  a local laboratory and monitoring for 
troponin T at a central laboratory .  Appropriate medical therapy  will be provided by  the 
investigator for any  clinically  significant increase in troponins including withholding or 
discontinuing the study  medication.
Pancreatic:  Islet cell fibrosis/fibroplasias and peri -islet hemorrhage, pigmented 
macrophages and inflammation were seen at 30 mg/kg in male rats and acinar cell 
apoptosis, vacuolation and/or degranulation were seen at 3 mg/kg in female dogs. 
Glucose (serum and urine), insulin, 1,5- AG and c -peptide will be monitored clinically  for 
changes associated with islet cell toxicity  and signs of gastric distress or abdominal pain 
that may  serve as a sign and/or sy mptom of acinar cell dy sfunction.  In addition, amy lase 
and lipase levels will be obtained.  Subjects will be monitored for clinical signs of 
malabsorption.
Hematologic and lymphoid:  Lymphoid t oxicity  was observed in rats and dogs 
manifested b y bone marrow hypo -cellularit y and variable and inconsistent changes in 
total white cell ly mphocyte and decreased platelet counts.  There were variable and 
inconsistent changes in multiple red blood cell parameters and reticulocy tes in the 
periphery , and decreased organ weight, thy mus, spleen, and l ymphnode h ypocellularity.  
Higher a ctivate d partial thromboplastin time (a PTT) and increased fibrinogen were seen 
at 3 mg/kg in dogs indicative of abnormal clott ing.  I n clinical studies, the complete 
blood count (CBC) and coagulation factors (INR, prothrombin time [PT], aPTT) will be 
measured frequently  to monitor for these toxicities.  Supportive therapy  will be provided 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
32according to standard medical practice, a nd treatment will be held for clinically  
significant toxicity .
Pulmonary: Aggregates of foam y macrophages in peri -bronchiolar areas were evident in 
rats given ≥10 mg/kg/day for 28 day s. Following the 3 week off -dose period, these 
changes were decreased in incidence. This effect may  be a result of unintended lung 
exposure due to the dosing procedure and an exacerbation of the finding b y GSK525762. 
This finding is unlikely  to affect pulmonary  function; no effects were observed in the 3 
month studies in rats a nd dogs .
In the stud y, patients will have pulmonary  function assessments at baseline and as 
clinically  appropriate. In addition, a chest x -ray will be obtained at baseline along with 
physical exams that will be performed throughout the study  (see Section 5).
Hepatic Toxicity : Non- adverse liver changes were observed in rats and dogs including 
increases in bilirubin levels and transient increases in AST in rats . Necrosis was observed 
in one rat at 30 mg/kg/day  in the 4 week stud y. GSK525762 has been demonstrated to 
undergo bioactivation in vitro which indicates potential fo r idiosy ncratic hep atotoxicity . 
The precursor metabolite has been observed in clinical plasma samples.
The BET115521 protocol includes frequent m onitoring of liver biochemistry  along with 
stopping criteria for dose limiting toxicity  (DLT), liver monitoring guidelines and 
management (see Section 3.2.3, Section 7.7.2, and Appendix 3).
Reproductive and Developmental: In toxicology studies of up to 3 month duration
, 
bilateral sperm retention, germ cell degeneration and tubular vacuolization, and depletion 
of testicular germina l epithelium occurred in male dogs receiving ≥ 0.
01mg/kg and male 
rats receiving ≥ 10 mg/kg doses of GSK525762.  Exposures associated with reproductive 
toxicity  in male dogs overlap with the proposed 5 mg starting dose in this FTIH 
study . These changes we re accompanied in rats and dogs b y changes in sperm 
morphology , motility  and number and hormonal changes (decreased testosterone and 
Inhibin B in rats and increased FSH in rats and dogs).  Reduced prostate weight and 
secretory  content was also evident in t he rat.  An effect on spermatogenesis is anticipated. 
Full or partial reversibility of the testicular effects was observed in the 3 month rat and 
dogs studies following a 17 week off dose period.
GSK525762 at 0, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day  (total dose; doses expressed as parent 
compound) was given orally  by gavage BID (doses given 6 hours apart) to pregnant rats 
on Day s 0 through 17 post -coitus. Dose- dependent maternal toxicity  (reduced body  
weight gain and reduced food consumption) was evident at ≥10 mg/kg/d ay. Embry o-fetal 
toxicity  was evident as both pre -implantation loss and increased fetal resorptions leading 
to complete loss of litters at 30 mg/kg/day , and dose -
dependent increased fetal 
resorptions at doses ≥1mg/kg/day . Developmental toxicity  was evident as decreased fetal 
weights at 10 mg/kg/day  and fetal malformations and/or variations at all doses 
(membranous ventricular septal defects in the heart ≥1 mg/kg/day ; great vessel, heart, 
kidney , ovary , uterus, and ureter malformations and/or variations at 10 mg/kg/day ). The 
AUC0 -t and Cmax at 1 mg/kg/day  (the lowest dose tested) in non-mated female rats after 
5 doses were 54 ng.h/mL and 18 ng/mL, respectively .
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
33No ovarian histologic changes were observed in the 4 week toxicology  studies, however 
female ferti lity (disrupted estrous cy clicit y, delays to mating and/or reduced fertility 
index) was affected in rats given 30 mg/kg/day  GSK525762 for 15 day s prior to mating 
and 15 day s prior to mating through to Day 6 post coitus (pc). Systemic exposure in rats 
was approximately  2-fold higher than current exposure in late stage cancer patients (at 60 
mg/day ).No fertility  effects were observed when 30 mg/kg/day  was given for 6 weeks 
followed b y 6 weeks off -dose prior to mating.
Reproductive and developmental toxicit y (decreased fetal bod y weight, fetal 
malformations or variations and / or pre -and post -implantation loss) occurred in rats 
given GSK525762 
≥1mg/kg/day  from conception through gestation day  17 (of 21 day s) 
and when dosed at ≥10 mg/kg/day  for 14 day s and d osing stopped prior to mating or 
continued until Day 6 pc. Systemic exposure in rats was approximately  80-fold lower 
than current exposure in late stage cancer patients (at 60 mg/day ).These results are 
consistent with observations that BRD2, BRD3, BRD4
and BRDT have crucial roles in 
reproducti on and development [see the GSK 525762 IB , GlaxoSmithKline Document 
Number 2011N113741_05, 2016]] for references.
Based on the findings in these reproductive and developmental toxicity  studies in rats 
with GSK525762, there is a substantiated risk for adverse effects on embryofetal 
development and impacts on female fertility .
In the BET11521 stud y, specific contraceptive guidelines and precautions for males and 
females are provided in the p rotocol.  In addition, the informed consent will include 
potential reproductive risks and precautions in addition to recommendations for the 
preservation of reproductive capacity .
Potential drug- drug interactions based on nonclinical studies: There is low potential 
for GSK525762 to induce or inhibit cy tochrome P450 (CYP) enzy mes or to inhibit Pgp 
or BCRP.  Use of concurrent drugs with potential to prolong QTcF will be used with 
extreme caution or prohibited (as outlined in Section 8.2.2 of the protocol).  Regarding 
drugs for h yperemesis, p alonosetron (administered per the prescribing information) and 
ondansetron (at a maximum oral dose of 8 mg TID) will be the only  allowed serotonin 5-
HT3 receptor antagonist drugs.

342. OBJECTIVES, ENDPOINT S, HYPOTHESES FOLLOW ING 
QD A ND/OR BID DOSING SCHEDULES
Primary
Objective  To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
GSK525762 in subjects 16 years or older following QD and/or BID dosing 
schedules.
 Toevaluate the clinical activity of GSK525762 in NMC and other solid tumors.
 To evaluate, after single dose administration, the relative bioavailability of the 
GSK525762 besylate tablet compared to the amorphous free-base tablet, the 
effect of high -fat high -calorie meal on the bioavailability of the besylate tablet 
and the dose proportionality of two doses of GSK525762 administered as the 
besylate tablets.
Endpoints  AEs, SAEs, dose reductions or delays, withdrawals due to toxicities and 
changes in safety as sessments (e.g., laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG, 
cardiotoxicity, gastrointestinal, etc.) to determine the MTD in subjects 16 years 
or older
 Assess overall response rate (RR) using RECIST 1.1 in NMC and other solid 
tumors or PSA50 response rate using PCWG2 guidelines in CRPC or DCR
(CR+PR+SD ≥ 16 weeks in duration) in GIST . 
 PK parameter values for GSK525762 following single oral administration as 
amorphous free -base or besylate tablet .
Hypothesis  No formal statistical hypotheses will be tested in Part 1. Analysis will be 
descriptive and exploratory. 
 The primary goal of Part 2 is to demonstrate a clinically meaningful response, 
defined as follows: 
NMC: this will be determined by testing the null hypothesis that the 
response rate is ≤5%, with about 80% power when the true response rate 
is 20%.

363. INVESTIGA TIONAL PLA N
3.1. Stud y Design/Schematic
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Therefore, adherence to the study  desig n 
requirements, including those specified in the Time and Events Tables, is essential.
This is an open -label, single and repeat dose, 2- part study  to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK5 25762 given 
once- daily orally. Twice daily  dosing may  also be explored upon evaluation of safet y, 
PK, and PD data from once -daily dosing.  Part 1 will be conducted in adult subjects with 
NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non -small cell lung cancer (NSCL C), colorectal 
cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer, 
and MYCN  driven solid tumors.  During the dose escalation of Part 1, additional 
sub
jects with NMC will be enrolled in a Pharmacody namic (PD) Expansion Cohort to 
evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of GSK525762 at lower doses that have been 
previously  cleared during dose escalation.  This will enable collection of 
pharmacod ynamic data ac ross the predicted efficacious dose range and contribute to the 
evaluation of a biologically  efficacious dose.  A sub-study  will be opened to 
approximately  10 to 12 subjects in the United States to investigate the relative 
bioavailability  of the besy late t ablet compared to the amorphous free -base tablet at the 
MTD or RP2D, the effect of high -fat high -calorie meal on the bioavailability  of the 
besylate tablet at the MTD or RP2D and the dose proportionality  of two doses of 
GSK525762 administered as bes ylate tablet. This sub -study  will also use a stable isotope 
of GSK525762 in order to reduce the variability  in the measurement of drug exposure 
caused b y day
-to-day biologic variations. Expansion cohorts (Part 2) are planned to 
further explore clinical activity  of GSK525762 in subjects with NMC, SCLC, CRPC, 
TNBC , ER+BC and GIST as shown in Figure 1. The expansion cohorts will enroll adult 
(16 y ears old and above) subjects at the appropriate R2PD dose. 
In Part 1, an accele rated dose titration will be employ ed with one subject per dose level 
until the first instance of a Grade 2 drug related toxicity  occurs. Thereafter, subjects will 
be enrolled in a standard 3+3 design. 
After the MTD has been determined in Part 1, Part 2 will be opened for the SCL C, 
TNBC, ER+BC and CRPC expansion cohorts. The NMC expansion cohort will be 
opened with the pivotal besy late tablet after results from the bes ylate stud y are available.
The GIST expansion cohort is being added in Amendment 9 due to pre-clinical evidence 
for bromodomain inhibition in GI ST.
In Part 1, all subjects will be evaluated for s ystemic and ex -vivo on- target BET inhibitory  
effects in blood. I n addition, pre -treatment and post -treatment tumor samples will be 
collected from sel ected subjects to be evaluated for target engagement and effects of 
GSK525762 on tumor biology .

After completion of either sequence all subjects enrolled in the sub- study  will be allowed 
to continue in the study  with a continuous daily  schedule. 
3.2. Discussion of Design
3.2.1. Part 1 Dose Escalation
Part 1 will start with an accelerated dose escalation schema in subjects ≥16 y ears ol d with 
one subject per dose level.  Accelerated dose titration will stop once a single Grade 2 or 
higher drug -related adverse event is observed in onesubject, at which point a standard 
3+3 dose escalation design will be implemented to define the MTD.  The details of these 
2 dose escalation strategies are in Figure 2.
In the accelerated dose escalation cohorts and the 3+3 dose escalation cohorts, the dose 
will be escalated based on all available data, including PK d ata and the safety  profile of 
prior cohorts, as well as the recommended dose from the Neuenschwander -Continuous 
Reassessment Method (N -CRM) design [Neuenschwander , 2009].  N -CRM design is a 
type of Bay esian a daptive dose escalation scheme.  The method is fully  adaptive and 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
38makes use of all the Dose L imiting Toxicity  (DLT) information available at the time of 
each dose assignment.  The DLT information of all subjects enrolled in the trial are used 
to update the dose-toxicity  relationship and provide supportive information in addition to 
3+3 design in the next escalation/de- escalation decision.
Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is determined or until a dose of 200mg per 
day is reached.

3.2.2. Dose Escalation and Schedule
In Part 1, subjects will dose once or twice dail y, depending on the cohort . Alternative 
dosing regimens and/or schedule may  be implemented based on emerging PK and safet y 
data.
Monitori ngfor cardiac safety  signals will be performed, with triplicate 12- lead ECGs to 
be performed on the day s indicated in the Time and Events Tables. 
Subjects will be evaluated for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 4 weeks of 
treatment (Sectio n 3.2.3).
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
393.2.2.1. Accelerated Dose Escalation in Part 1
One subject per dose level in the accelerated dose escalation schema will be treated to 
minimize suboptimal drug exposures, starting with Dose Level 1 ( Table 2) and 
continuing until 
one subject experiences a Grade 2 or higher (based on CTCAE v. 4.0) 
drug related adverse event or a DLT. Once this occurs, the accelerated dose escalation 
will terminate, and subjects will be enrolled under a standard 3+3 design (i.e., 3 subject 
cohorts) (Section 3.2.2.2).
Table 2 Accelerated Dose Escalation Procedures in Part 1

NOTE: Route/Administrat ion/Duration: Oral QD or BID (specific dosing instructions will be provided to each 
subject).
3.2.2.2. 3+3 Dose Escalation in Part 1
Two additional subjects will be enrolled to the dose level at which accelerated dose 
titration ends, for a total of at least 3 subjects at that dose level. If no DLTs are observed 
in any  of the 3 patients then dosing will proceed to the next higher dose level ( ≤2 fold 
increase in dose). Subjects will be entered in a staggered approach with at least 3 day s 
between each subject to minimi ze the risk of inadvertently  exceeding the maximum 
tolerated dose in multiple subjects. Dose escalation decisions will be made as outlined in 
Table 3. Escalation to the next dose level will not increase greater tha n 2 fold from the 
previous dose level. If 2 or more DLTs are observed at an y dose level, the MTD will 
have been exceeded.
Once the MTD 
is reached, up to 20 additional subjects may  be enrolled at the MTD to 
further evaluate safet y and tumor PD. Up to an additional 6 subjects may  be enrolled at 
any dose level below the MTD in order to obtain additional dose/response information 
related to tumor PD.  Additional cohorts (with daily  exposure not exceeding QD MTD 
exposure) may  also be initiated to explore alterna tive dosing schedules to optimize the 
PK, safet y and tolerability profile (see Section 3.2.2.4 ).  The enrolment of additional 
subjects as described could be in parallel with Part 2 enrolment.

3.2.2.3. Biopsy  and PET Cohorts during Dose Escalation Phase
During the accelerated dose escalation phase 18FDG -PET and biops y assessments will be 
optional until the standard 3+3 design is implemented. At this point, the sites wi ll be 
required to obtain biopsies (when accessible) and required to perform 18FDG -PET 
assessments when appropriate.  Additional details on biopsy  collection are provided in 
Section 6.8.1.
3.2.2.4. Alteration of Schedule
Alterations may  be made to the schedule of administration and/or PK/PD sampling 
schedule based on the results of emerging PK and safet y data.
Schedules that incorporate a recovery  period may  be explored (e.g. every  other day  or 
two weeks on treatment follo
wed by  one week off). This approach will be considered if 
the safet y and PK data suggest that a therapeutic exposure cannot be achieved using the 
initial schedule without excessive toxicity . The starting dose for the alternate schedule 
will be the highest completed dose level (at or below MTD) with the initial schedule. 
Escalation can then proceed as described using 3 + 3 dose escalation.  If alternative 
dosing schedules are explored, PK sampling times and other safet y assessments may be 
modified to reflect the new dosing schedule. 
On completion of the besylate sub -study  for relative bioavailability of bes ylate 
formulation in tablet form, and having determined a dose for Part 2, all subjects in Part 1 
daily  dosing cohorts and in Part 2 will be administered the bes ylate tablets at the 
recommended Part 2 dose of 75 mg once daily . Those subjects in Part 1 daily  dosing 
cohort who were on amorphous tablet dosing before availabilit y of bes ylate tablets, they  
will be switched to the equivalent besy late tablet dose and will have limited PK samples 
drawn after start on bes ylate tablets.
In Part 2, subjects approved to alter their current dose level with either a dose reduction 
or dose escalation may  require additional limited PK sampling , after discussion with the 
GSK Medical Monitor.
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
413.2.2.5. BID Dosing Cohort
BID dosing will be explored, based on the short half-life.  The initial dose level for BID 
will be 20mg BID or “x”mg BID (where 2x is equivalent to the last once daily  dose 
cleared for dose escalation in Part 1) –which ever is lower.  Dosing will be separated b y 
approximately  12 hours (± 1 hr). Escalation can then proceed as described using the 3 + 3 
dose escalation. Additional blood samples will be collected for
 PK, PD, and safet y as 
described in Table 7. 
Subjects may  need to undergo dose modification(s) to manage toxicities.  A dose 
adjustment (e.g., BID dose level with a minimum 25% reduction in total daily  dosing or 
QD at the same or lower dose level) may  be explored after co
nsultation with GSK 
Medical Monitor. The investigator should use clinical judgment to determine whether the 
dosing scheduling may  be contributing to an y potential toxicity  necessitating dose 
adjustment, and make the appropriate change after consultation wi th the GSK Medical 
Monitor.
3.2.2.6. Intra -Subject Dose Escalation
Intra -subject dose escalations may  be considered on a case -by-case basis, provided that 
the subject has not experienced an y Grade 2 or higher drug related toxicity during the 
first 4 weeks of invest igational therap y in the accelerated dose escalation phase or a DLT 
in the 3+3 dose escalation phase and contingent upon one of the following:
If additional subject(s) have been enrolled at a higher dose in the dose escalation 
phase and at least one subjec t has completed 4 weeks of dosing on that regimen 
without a DL T, and after review of all safet y data and approval b y a GSK Medical 
Monitor, a subject on a lower dose level may  be increased up to the highest dose 
level tested.  In this case the subject may  begin daily  dosing at the higher dose level 
as it will have alread y been demonstrated to be tolerable.
If no further subjects have been identified for a subsequent higher dose level and 
after a subject has completed 4 weeks of dosing on that regimen withou t a DL T, that 
subject may  be escalated to the next higher dose level after an additional 4 weeks of 
dosing (total of 8 weeks of dosing), review of all safet y data and approval by  a GSK 
Medical Monitor. In this case the subject must follow the dosing/monito ring 
schedule for the first 4 -weeks as 
outlined in the Time and Events Tables , ashe/she 
will be the first subject exposed to the higher dose. 
In Part 1, s ubjects approved for intra -subject dose escalation will require additional 
limited PK sampling (pre -dose, 0.5, 3 and 6 -8 hours) at the higher dose, as determined by  
GSK Clinical Pharmacology .  Additional safet y assessments such as insulin/glucose or 
cardiac monitoring may  be specified at the time of dose escalation or schedule 
modification based on the s afety profile in previous subjects at the higher dose level. 
Intra -subject dose escalations or schedule modification will be discussed with 
investigators and approved by  the GSK Medical Monitor and safet y monitoring required 
will be specified in writing.

BET115521
423.2.3. Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
An event will be considered a DLT if it occurs within the first 4 weeks of therap y and 
meets one of the following criteria:
Neutropenia:
- Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 7day s.
- Febrile neutropenia: as defined b y CTCAE version 4.0 lasting for >24 hours despite 
adequate treatment.
Grade 4 thrombocy topenia.
Drug related Grade 3 or 4 non
-hematologic toxicity  (including QTcF) as described in 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 (excluding 
abnormalities of alanine a minotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) (see criteria below). In addition, the DLT exceptions include: rash, diarrhea, 
fatigue, mucositis, nausea, and vomiting that do respond to standard medical care 
within 72 hours or for electroly te disturbances within 24 hours). 
Drug related Grade 2 non -hematological toxicity  (at any  time during treatment) that 
in the judgment of the investigator and GSK Medical Monitor is dose -limiting.
Grade 2 Troponin T elevation (central laboratory  >Upper limit of normal [ULN]),
measured on two separate occasions within 48 hours in order to confirm elevation 
andwith other clinical signs, symptoms, laboratory tests consistent with cardiac
toxicity .(In the event a troponin T (central laboratory  assessment) is not performed 
or a laboratory  error occurs, considerations for a DLT criteria will involve review of 
two separate local troponin (I  or T) assay s done within 48 hours at a local 
investigator site. Troponin I  or T elevations greater than the upper limit of norm al, 
and > 10% coefficient of variance (CV) for that assay  will be considered as a grade 2 
elevation.)
Treatment delay  of 14 day s or greater due to unresolved drug -related toxicity .
ALT 3x ULN + bilirubin  2xUL N (>35% direct) or ALT between 3- 5 X ULN with 
bilirubin < 2xUL N but with hepatitis sy mptoms or rash or ALT 5xULN.
3.2.4. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 
Dose (RP2D)
The MTD will be exceeded if 2 or more subjects in a cohort of up to 6 subjects 
experience a DLT.
The recommended Phase 2 (Part 2) dose (RP2D) will be determined based on the MTD 
or biologicall y active dose (example: clinical response), the safet y profile and available 
pharmacod ynamic data generated from all subjects in Parts 1. The MTD will be the 
RP2D for Part 2 of the study unless there is a lower dose that provides a more favorable 
safet y/tolerability  profile while providing adequate exposure, biomarker inhibition or 
clinical activity . If necessary , alternate schedules can be explored to determine additional 
biologicall y active doses even after a RP2D is defined.

433.2.5. Part 1
3.2.5.1. NMC Pharmacody namic Expansion Cohort
In the event there are no available enrollment slots during 3+3 dose escalation, eligible 
subjects with NMC (Section 6.2) may  be enrolled in a Pharmacody namic (PD) Expansion 
Cohort to evaluate the pharmacod ynamics of GSK525762 at doses that have previousl y 
been cleared during 3+3 dose escalation.  Three subjects with NMC will be allowed to 
enroll at the last cleared dose level on ly if subjects with NMC or other solid tumor ty pes 
(Section 4.2.1 Inclusion Criteria) have alread y enrolled in 3+3 dose escalation. 
Enrollment in the PD Expansion Cohort will continue until either 12 subjects wi th NMC 
are enrolled in the PD Expansion Cohort, or until the RP2D is determined in Part 1, 
whichever occurs first.  Eligibility  criteria for subjects diagnosed with NMC to enroll in 
this cohort are described in Section 4.2(Part 1). NMC subjects with non
-measurable 
disease by RECI ST 1.1 but clinically  evaluable for progression or response may  be 
considered for enrollment after discussion with the GSK Medical Monitor.  Biopsy 
collection will be mandatory  as descri bed in Section 3.2.2.3 , unless a waiver is granted b y 
the GSK medical monitor.  18FDG -PET will be required for all subjects in this cohort.
Subjects in the 
NMC PD Expansion Cohort will start with same dosing sch edule 
described in Section 3.2.2 ; Monitoring for cardiac safet y signals will be performed as 
required in Part 1 with triplicate 12- lead ECGs to be performed on the day s indicated in 
the Time and Events Table.  All safet y and PK evaluations will be performed as outlined 
in the Time and Events Tables for Part 1 (Section 5).  Safet y data from subjects in the 
NMC PD Expansion Cohort will be reviewed on an ongoing basis b
ythe GSK medical 
monitor, GSK Safety  Review Team, and investigators for consideration during 3+3 dose 
escalation decisions.  
Subjects will be eligible for intra-subject dose escalation to a higher approved dose as 
described in Section 3.2.2.6 , upon completion of the 4 week observation period, tumor 
biopsy  collection, and approval by the investigator and GSK medical monitor in 
consultation with the GSK study  team.  Subjects approved for intra -subject dose 
escalat ion will require additional limited PK sampling (pre-dose, 0.5, 3 and 6 -8 hours) at 
the higher dose, as determined by  GSK Clinical Pharmacology . Subjects may  continue on 
daily  administration of GSK525762 until permanent discontinuation or completion of the
study  as described in Section 4.2.4.1.
3.2.6. Bioavailability , Food Effect, and Dose Proportionality  Besy late 
Sub-Study
Part 1 will include a bes ylate sub -study  that will be an open
-label, randomized, single 
dose, four period, cross over study  to investigate the relative bioavailability of the 
besylate salt tablet compared to the amorphous free -base tablet at or near the MTD or 
RP2D, the effect of high -fat high -calorie meal on the bioavailability  of the besy late salt 
tablet at or near the MTD or RP2D and the dose proportionality  of two doses of 
GSK525762 administered as bes ylate salt tablets. GSK525762 dosing will be separated 
by at least 48 hours.  Up to 12 subjects in the United States may  be enrolled in besy late 
sub-study . A subject requiring dose reduction or discontinuation from study before 
completion of the Besy late Sub -Study  will be replaced b y a new enrollment. All subjects 
enrolled to the Bes ylate Sub -Study , on completion of their participation in this segment 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
44of the study , will continue on a dail y dosing schedule till disease progression or 
discontinuation due to investigational agent related toxicity  or withdrawal of informed 
consent.  The high- fat (approximately  50% of the total caloric content of the meal), high-
calorie mea l (approximately  800 to 1000 calories) will be the representative example 
given b y the 2002 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance [FDA , 2002]. I t 
includes the following: two eggs fried in butter, two strips of b acon, two slices of toast 
with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes and eight ounces of whole milk.
In order to reduce variability  in measurement of drug exposure caused by  day-to-day 
biologic variation, a small (<10% of total dose) liquid dose of a stable, non- radioactive 
13C isotope labeled version of GSK525762 bes ylate salt, will be coadministered orally  
with each fasted treatment in besy late sub- study  to serve as an internal standard for 
quantitation purposes (Refer to Section 7.1for additional information). Use of this stable 
isotope approach will allow better characterization of the impact of the besylate salt and 
dose on GSK525762 bioavailability , if an y (Parr, 2012).

3.2.7. Part 2 Expansion Cohort
Based on the anal ysis and evaluation of the safet y profile and available 
pharmacod ynamic, pharmacokinetic and efficacy data generated from all subje cts 
enrolled in Part 1 as of January  28, 2016, including the anal ysis of subjects enrolled in the 
Besylate Sub- Study , the final dose and regimen for Part 2 is determined to be 75 mg once 
daily . The bes ylate salt tablets will be the formulation used for sub jects enrolled in Part 2 
(and potentially for ongoing or newl y enrolled subjects in Part 1). Additional details and 
supporting information are provided under separate cover in a companion document and 
dose decision memo. Approximately  170 subjects with NMC , SCL C, CRPC, TNBC , 
ER+BC and GI STwill be enrolled in expansion cohort at the RP2D to gather more safet y 
data and to further assess anti
-tumor activity . 
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
45Subjects in Part 2 will start with a continuous daily dosing schedule unless safet y, PK or 
PD data ne cessitate a different dosing schedule. 
The statistical design and number of subjects to be enrolled in a cohort is based on the 
predictive probability  of success if enrollment continues until all planned subjects are 
recruited [ Lee, 2008]. The predictive probability  design allows for evaluation of stopping 
rules after each subject once a minimum number of subjects are evaluable. In this 
particular stud y, we will stop only  for futility . Final decisions on stopping enrollm ent will 
depend on the totality  of the data collected.
For NMC, to test for 20% ORR relative to a 5% ORR suggesting no activity with 0.1 
type I error and 80% power, first interim look may be conducted once 10 evaluable 
subjects have been enrolled into t he expansion cohort or treated at the same dose level to 
examine safet y and efficacy ;if 0 responses are observed, further enrolment into this 
cohort may  be terminated. The number of observed confirmed responses will guide 
further enrolment according to th e rules summarized in Figure 3. A maximum of 25 
subjects in this cohort will be enrolled at the RP2D.  All available data will be considered 
in making enrollment decisions.

514. STUDY POPULA TION
4.1. Number of Subjects
The number of dose levels and the level at which the MTD will be reached cannot be 
determined in advance. An adequate number of subjects will be enrolled into the study  to 
establish a re commended dose(s) and schedule(s) of GSK525762 for further study . To 
complete Part 1, it is estimated 90 to 110evaluable subjects will be enrolled. The 
besylate sub -study  will enroll approximately  10 to 12 subjects in the United States only . 
Part 2 will enroll approximately  170 subjects.
If a subject discontinues the study  before completing Week 4 during Part 1 due to reasons 
other than toxicity , additional subjects may  be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor in 
consultation with the investigator to e nsure adequate population for DLT and MTD 
evaluations.
If subjects discontinue the study  before completing Week 8 during Part 2, additional 
subjects may  be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor in consultation with the 
investigator to ensure adequate p opulation for determination of response within NMC
and other expansion cohorts.
4.2. Eligibilit y Criteria
4.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
Deviations from inclusion criteria are not allowed because they  can potentially  jeopardize

4.2.3. Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical trial but 
are never subsequently  dosed with study  treatment .
4.2.4. Permanent Discontinuation from Study Treatment and Subject 
Completion Criteria
4.2.4.1. Permanent Discontinuation from Study  Treatment
Subjects will receive study  treatment until disease progression, death or unacceptable 
adverse event, including meeting stopping criteria for liver chemistry  defined in 
Appendix 3 or for hematologic and other non -hematologic toxicity . After disease 
progression, subjects may be allowed to continue treatment with study  drug if the 
Investigator strongly believes, and the Sponsor Medic al Monitor concurs, that the subject 
could continue to receive benefit (for example in cases of an isolated new lesion, with the 
majority  of the disease still under control).
In addition study  treatment may  be permanently  discontinued for any  of the follow ing 
reasons:
deviation(s) from the protocol
request of the subject or proxy
investigator’s discretion
subject is lost to follow -up
study  is closed or terminated.
The primary  reason study  treatment was permanently  discontinued must be documented 
in the subj ect’s medical records and case report form (CRF). 
If the subject voluntaril y discontinues from treatment due to toxicity , ‘adverse event’ will 
be recorded as the primary reason for permanently discontinuation on the CRF.  
Once a subject has permanently  discontinued from study  treatment, the subject will not 
be allowed to be retreated. 
All subjects who discontinue from stud y treatment will have safet y assessments at the 
time of discontinuation and during post stud y treatment 
(End of Treatment) as specifie d 
in Time and Events Tables. 
All subjects who permanently  discontinue study  treatment without disease progression 
will be followed for progression according to the protocol schedule until:
progression
2011N1185 99_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
58death, or
subject has been followed for 2 years after stopping treatment. 
All subjects who permanently  discontinue study  treatment for any  reason will be 
followed for survival and new anti
-cancer therapy  [including radiotherap y] every  6 
months until death or until the subject has been followed for 2 years. R eporting of an y 
pregnancies in female subjects and/or female partners of male subjects will also be 
collected until 7 months after the last dose of study  drug. If subjects are unable or 
unwilling to attend clinic visits during follow-up, contact to assess survival may  be made 
via another form of communication (e.g., telephone, email, etc.).
4.2.4.2. Subject and Study  Completion
In Part 1, a subject will be considered to have completed the study  if:
they complete screening assessments, the 28
-day DLT observation peri od,and the 
end-of-treatment follow -up visit,
they progress or die while receiving study  treatment, or
are receiving ongoing study  treatment at the time of the Sponsor’s decision to 
close the study .
In Part 2, 
asubject will be considered to have completed the study  if:
they progressed or die while receiving study  treatment, or
are receiving ongoing study  treatment at the time of the
Sponsor’s decision to 
close the study .
Subjects who have not died, and are no longer being followed for survival are consider ed 
to have discontinued the study.  The End of Study eCRF should only  be completed when 
a subject is no longer being followed.  The stud y may be considered completed for 
purposes of a final anal ysiswhen 70% of subject senrolled 
at part 2 have progressed or 
died.  If available, subject scontinuing on treatment at the time of final analysis may  be 
offered the option to continue in a rollover trial.

A signed, written informed consent form must be obtained from the subject prior to an y 
study -specific procedures or assessments.
Refer to the Time and Events Tables for the timing of all assessments (Section 5). 
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing Study  Procedures Manual (SPM). The SPM will provide 
the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not 
impact subject safet y.
Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s routine clinical managemen t (e.g., blood 
count, imaging stud y) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized 
for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined 
criteria and has been performed in the timeframe of the study .
Inves tigators may  be requested to perform additional safet y tests during the course of the 
study  based on newl y available data to ensure appropriate safet y monitoring. Appropriate 
local regulatory and ethical approvals should be obtained before any  additional t esting is 
performed.

861, the investigator will review the ECG data manually , and should not rely  solely  on the 
automatic readings of the equipment, when making decisions regarding dosing of 
subjects.
During Part 1, a triplicate 12-lead ECG should be performed at Screening and at all 
other time points.  Triplicate ECGs should be done for all time points on Serial 
Pharmacokinetic sampling days. 
During Part 2, single 12 -lead ECGs should be performed at the time points indicated 
in the Time and Events Tables. Standard 12 -lead ECGs (Safet y ECGs) will be 
performed as part of the real- time assessment of subjects and may  not be included in 
the primary  QT anal ysis. Safety  ECGs should be reviewed by  the investigator on an 
ongo ing basis for safet y purposes. The dosing for each new week in the first cy cle 
should not begin until the safet y ECG has been reviewed and no significant 
abnormalities have been detected
If a subject meets the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration criteria below, study  
treatment(s) will be withheld.
QTc interval ≥ 500 msec OR interval increase from baseline  60 msec: I P 
will be discontinued unless the benefits of therap y outweigh the risk of 
rechallenge in the opinion of the Investigator, the GSK Medical Mo nitor, as 
well as the GSK medical governance. In this situation, rechallenge may  be 
permitted (see Table 24for rechallenge guidelines).
NOTE: QT interval duration criteria should be based on the average QTc value of 
triplicate el ectrocardiograms (ECGs) to include manual over -read. For example, if an 
ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, obtain 2 additional ECGs over a brief period 
(e.g., within approximately  10 minutes of the abnormal ECG, if possible, and 
approximately  10 mi nutes apart from each other), and then use the averaged QTc values 
of the 3 ECGs to determine whether the subjects should have study  treatment 
discontinued.
The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula 
(QTcF). 
For eligibility  and withdrawal, QTcF will be used for all subjects. 
For purposes of data analy sis, QTcF will be used.
Baseline results are defined by the nearest timepoint prior to first dose. For this trial , 
when triplicate ECGs are indicated at baseline, the baseline QTcF value is determined b y 
the mean of the triplicate W1D 1 pre-dose QTcF results. If these results are not available, 
then the mean QTcF of the screening triplicate ECG results would be used.
Abnormal ECGs should be evaluated manuall y prior to final decision making. ECG data 
may be transferred and reviewed by  an independent central reviewer.

876.4.6. Clinical Laboratory  Assessments
All protocol required safety  laboratory  assessments, as defined in Table 19 , are 
performed at the institution’s local laboratory . All non- safet y assessments (example: 
pharmacokinetic samples, biopsy , translational samples) will be assessed by  a central 
laboratory . Please refer to the Study  Procedures Manual (SPM) for appropriate 
processing and handling of samples to avoid duplicate and/or additional blood draws.
Some laboratory  assessments can vary  throughout the day  such as testosterone.  I t is 
recommended but not mandated that laboratory  assessments are collected at 
approximately  the same time on each clinic day . If abnormal testosterone levels are 
observed, repeat measurements should occur at the approximate baseline timing to ensure 
this is a trend and not a single outl ying event.

88Subjects should be instructed to fast (no food and only  water allowed) for 10 hours prior 
to any  fasting laboratory  assessments (example: fasting glucose, fasting lipid panel, etc). 
Abnormal laboratory  results that are considered by  the investigator to be clinically  
significant should be recorded on the eCRF as AEs. I n addition, these clinically  
significant abnormal laboratory  results should be followed until the abnormality  resolves 
or is determined to be stable.
6.4.6.1. Troponin
Two samples for troponin will be collected at each time -point as outlined in Time and 
Events Table s. Troponin T will be assessed at a central laboratory  as a means of 
consistent evaluation across a ll subjects. A second sample will be assessed at a local 
laboratory  for purposes of subject management. Whenever possible, troponin T will be 
assay ed by the local laboratory . However, either troponin I  or troponin T may  be assessed 
at a local laboratory . The same local laboratory  test (troponin I  or troponin T) should be 
used consistently  for an individual subject throughout the study . 
6.4.6.2. Clinical Laboratory  Assessments Required Prior to Scheduled 
Surgeries
Subjects must have a platelet count of ≥75,000/mm3and a PT, I NR and aPTT that are 
within normal limits within 48 hours prior to the post- dose biopsy  and any  scheduled 
surgical procedures.
6.5. Efficacy
6.5.1. Disease A ssessment
Tumor response will be assessed as outlined in Time an d Event Tables by the investigator 
using RECI ST 1.1 ( Appendix 6 ) or the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) 
guidelines 
[Scher , 2008] and documented in the eCRF as: progressive disease (PD), 
stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR).  For subjects 
with NB the appropriate tests and criteria will be followed (See Time and Events Tables , 
Appendix 6 ). See the SPM for additional instr uctions.
GSK requires sites to provide electronic copies (upload digital images or images on CD) 
of scans for all subjects for central storage which may  be transferred to a central 
independent imaging center. This includes baseline scans and all scans perf ormed during 
the course of the study . GSK may  request an independent review of scans. See SPM for 
additional details.  
6.6. Pharmacokinetics
6.6.1. Blood Sample Collection
Blood samples to enable quantification of GSK525762 in plasma will be collected at the 
time poi nts indicated in Time and Events Tables. The actual date and time of each blood 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
89sample collection will be recorded. The timing of PK samples may  be altered and/or PK 
samples may  be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring. 
Detai ls of PK sample collection, processing, storage and shipping procedures are 
provided in the Study Procedures Manual (SPM). 
6.6.2. Plasma Sample A nalysis
Plasma analy sis will be performed under the management of Worldwide Bioanal ysis, 
Drug Metabolism and Pharmaco kinetics (DMPK), GlaxoSmithKline. Concentrations of 
GSK525762 will be determined in plasma samples using the currentl y approved 
analytical methodology . In addition, selected metabolites of GSK525762 may  also be 
quantified using approved anal ytical methodol ogy. Raw data will be stored in the GL P 
Archives, GlaxoSmithKline. 
In addition, plasma may  be anal yzed qualitativel y for other circulating compound -related 
material and the results will be reported under a separate DMPK protocol.
6.6.3. Urine Collection
Urine sa mples for quantitative anal ysis of GSK525762 may be collected at the time
points noted in the Time and Events Table s for Part 1 of the study  (these samples are 
optional as of Amendment 9) . 
Selected urine samples may  be analy zed qualitatively  and/or quanti tativel y for 
GSK525762 metabolites and the results will be reported under a separate DMPK 
protocol.
Details of urine sample collection, processing, storage and shipping procedures are 
provided in the SPM.
6.6.4. Caffeine, A lcohol, and Tobacco
During serial PK sam pling day s (as outlined in Section 5), subjects will abstain from 
ingesting alcohol, tobacco products, caffeine -or xanthine -
containing products (e.g. 
coffee, tea, cola drinks, chocolate) for 24 hours prior to the start of dosing until collection 
of the final pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacod ynamic sample during each session. 
6.6.5. Activity
Subjects will abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours prior to each blood collection 
for clinical laboratory  tests. 
6.7. Pharmacody namics
6.7.1. Rationale for 18FDG -PET
The inclusion of 18F-FDG PET is based on the limited past experience with this modality  
of imaging in NUT Midline Carcinoma. In an small study  (n=1) conducted at the Dana 
Farber Cancer Institute, an intolerable dose of Vorinostat demonstrated marked reduction 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
90in glucose uptake in a 28 day  period, which correlated with a smaller reduction in tumor 
volume by  CT. On this basis, it would appear that at least in this case NMC is highly  
metabolically  active, and thus glucose uptak e may be a sensitive surrogate marker of 
tumor inhibition. 
6.7.2. Assessments for PET
During the dose escalation phase in Part 1,18F-FDG PET assessments will be optional 
until the standard 3+3 design is implemented. At this point, the sites will be required to 
perform 18F-FDG PET assessments for all NMC subjects and other solid tumors as 
appropriate.
During Part 2 , PET (FDG or fluoride) scans should be performed at baseline, with follow 
up scans conducted as clinically  appropriate (as outlined in the T&E Table 16).
Additional details will be provided in the SPM . 
Additional analy sis may  be conducted b y a
nindependent central reviewer. Instructions 
for submission of data are provided in the SPM. 
6.8. Translational Research
Blood and/or tumor tissue specimens will be collected at various times throughout the 
study  in order to support research aimed at identify ing indicators of sensitivity/resistance 
to GSK525762, understanding the biological effect of GSK525762 and BET inhibition, 
and also to support diagnostic assay  development for NMC. 
Toward that end the successful collection of quality tumor specimens will be critical to 
furthering our understanding of BET biology  and identify ingthe best way  to treat 
patients with a BET inhibitor. Specific ally, the evaluation of responders, responders at 
relapse, and non -responders for gene mutation status and/or pathway  activation may  lead 
to the discovery  of potential new diagnostic markers or novel combinations. Similarly , 
pre-and post -dose tumor specim ens will be evaluated for markers of target engagement, 
tumor response, and/or evaluated for changes in gene expression; thus supporting 
identification of a biologically  effective dose and furthering our mechanistic 
understanding of BET inhibition in these settings. 
The biopsies will be assessed for transcripts or proteins that reflect BET target 
engagement and/or tumor biology  (For NMC, markers of cell proliferation and/or cell 
differentiation (e.g., Ki67 and cytokeratin [ Schwartz , 2011]) will be analy zed.  Biopsies 
may also be assessed for Deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA), Ribonucleic acid (RNA) or 
proteins which may  be potential predictors of sensitivity  or resistance to BET inhibition 
based on emerging data.
6.8.1. Tumor Tis sue Collection
NMC patients in Part 1 
will be required to submit a fresh or archival tumor specimen for 
retrospective diagnostic confirmation. NMC patients in Part 2 will be required to submit 
a fresh or archival tumor specimen to the central laboratory  for diagnosis. Due to the 
timely  need to determine NMC status by  NUT IHC testing, a pre -screen informed 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
91consent may  be offered to expedite obtaining the tissue in Part 2. These specimens may  
also be evaluated retrospectivel y for exploratory research as desc ribed above. 
All non-NMC patients will also be asked to submit an archival tumor specimen for 
retrospective testing for potential markers of sensitivity  and/or resistance, e .g., N- Myc 
amplification; however ,this will not be an eligibility  requirement.
During the accelerated dose escalation phase (Part 1), fresh pre -and post -dose biopsy  
collections will be optional until the standard 3+3 design is implemented.  During the 3+3 
dose escalation phase in Part 1, and during Part 2, pre-and post -treatment biop sies are 
collected as outlined in the Time and Events Tables and are mandatory . Archival tissue 
may be accepted as a pre -treatment specimen if the subject is treatment naïve. For 
subjects in Part 1 and 2, if tumor tissue is not accessible, discussion with the GSK 
medical monitor is required. 
Subjects must have a platelet count of 
≥75,000/mm3and a PT, INR and aPTT that are 
WNL within 48 hours prior to the post -dose biopsy .If study  medication is held prior to 
the post -dose biopsy , dosing must be re- started and subjects should receive 4 consecutive 
days of dosing prior to collection of the biopsy . Specific timing of post -dose sample 
collection is defined in the T&E table. See Stud y Procedures Manual (SPM) and central 
lab manual for additional details.
6.8.2. Whole 
blood LPS -induced IL- 6, Plasma Cytokines, and Plasma 
Protein Biomarkers
6.8.2.1. LPS-induced (Stimulated) Whole Blood Ex Vivo
GSK525762 has consistently  shown inhibition of LPS induced IL -6 across different 
human cell populations and in different species. The actio n of the compound is through 
inhibition of the assembly of transcriptional complexes required to express the protein. 
Pre-clinical studies demonstrate that blood concentration of drug correlates to the degree 
of inhibition of L PS induced IL -6 in ex vivo wh ole blood samples. Therefore, this 
biomarker will be used as an indication of pharmacology  and will be aligned with PK 
sampling. Since inhibition of BET family  proteins is known to inhibit a range of pro-
inflammatory  mediators and acute phase proteins, a n umber of additional proteins (46) 
will also be measured from these ex vivo samples.
6.8.2.2. Systemic (Unstimulated) Plasma for Cy tokines, Chemokines, and A cute 
Phase Proteins
The set of analy tes identical to that used in the whole blood ex vivo assay  (including for 
example, MCP -1, MI P1-βIL-8) will also be measured in plasma samples taken during 
PK sampling. This will assess sy stemic inflammatory  response in the subject using 
biomarkers such as pro -inflammatory  cytokines and acute phase proteins and correlate 
the sy stemic response to drug with that in stimulated and unstimulated blood. These 
biomarkers are expected to change over day s rather than hours, based on the plasma half 
lives and pre -clinical data, such that sampling will also be performed after repeat dosing.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
926.8.2.3. Whole Blood mRNA
GSK 525762 has been shown to modulate the expression of a number of different genes in 
unstimulated whole blood between 1 h and 6 h. The mRNA levels of 31 such genes form 
a ‘signature’ panel which will also be used as a biomarker of engagement of 
pharmacology  and will be measured using mRNA isolated from whole blood. The 
modulation of a number of these genes will also be measured as changes in sy stemic 
proteins as well as in the anal ysis of the ex vivo assay  blood samples (e.g. CCL2 and IL -
8) thus relating mRNA and protein expression with drug concentration.  Other 
translational research studies, such as transcriptomics profiling, will also be performed 
using whole blood mRNA from selected patients.
Until preliminary  subject data are generated for these biomarke rs, it will be necessary
 to 
monitor frequentl y. Pleas e refer to the Time and Events T ables for specific details on 
timing of samples. Further details regarding the sampling procedure and how to process 
the blood samples will be provided in the SPM.
6.8.3. Biomark er Blood Sample Timing and Schedule
A change in frequency  of blood biomarker sampling times may  be implemented based on 
emerging data. This would be determined during dose escalation decision meetings and 
communicated to the sites in the meeting minutes fo r implementation.
6.8.4. Exploratory  Safety  Biomarker Blood Samples
Unscheduled biomarker sample(s) may  be collected based on emerging safety . One to 
three samples may  be collected in a day  to address specific safet y concerns. Each sample 
would be up to 10mL  of w hole blood to look at cytokines, gene signature (mRNA) or 
other plasma proteins. The timing of the samples will be based on emerging safet y data 
and would be discussed and determined b y GSK medical monitor and study team review.
6.9. Adverse Events (AE) and Serious A dverse Events (SA E)
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as outlined in Section 6.9.1 and Section 
6.9.2.
6.9.1. Definition of an A E
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicina l product.
Note: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, thi s 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits, abuse, or misuse. Examples of events 
meeting the definition of an AE include:
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
93Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or grade of t he condition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinica l sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE). 
“Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se is not to be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, an y signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from “lack of efficacy ” will be reported as an AE or SAE, if they  fulfill the 
definition of an AE or SAE. 
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgical proce dure (e.g., endoscopy , appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the su bject’s 
condition. 
6.9.2. Definition of a SA E
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence that, at any  dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which 
the subj ect was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
NOTE: In general, hospitalization s ignifies that the subject has been detained (usuall y 
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency  ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or out 
subject setting. Complicatio ns that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE 
should be considered seri ous.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
94Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , or
NOTE: The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduc t 
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may  interfere or prevent 
every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect. 
f.Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definition. These sho uld also be considered 
serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of 
drug dependency  or drug abuse
g.Protocol -Specific SAEs are as follows:
All events of possible drug -induced liver injury  with hy perbilirubinaemia defined as 
ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xUL N (>35% direct) (or ALT 3xULN and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured) or terme d ‘Hy ’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply  to subjects receiving 
anticoagulants).
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, 
record presence of dete ctable urinary  bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin 
elevations and suggesting liver injury . If testing is unavailable and a subject meets the 
criterion of total bilirubin 2xUL N, then the event is still reported as an SAE. If INR is 
obtained, include values on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.5 suggest severe liver 
injury  
Any new primary  cancers
Significant Cardiac d ysfunction 
Grade 4 laboratory  abnormalities (not disease related)
Drug related hepatobiliary event leading to permanent discontin uation of study  
treatment
6.9.3. Laboratory  and Other Safety  Assessment A bnormalities 
Reported as A Es and SA Es
Any abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis), or 
other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements) 
including those that worsen from baseline, that are judged b y the investigator to be 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
95clinically  significant are to be recorded as an AE or SAE, in accordance with the 
definitions provided. The investigator will exercise his or her me dical and scientific 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clinically  significant.
In addition, an associated AE or SAE is to be recorded for an y laboratory  test result or 
other safet y assessment that l ed to an intervention, including permanent discontinuation 
of study  treatment, dose reduction, and/or dose interruption/delay . 
Any new primary  cancer must be reported as an SAE. 
However, an y clinicall y significant safet y assessments that are associated w ith the 
underly ing disease, unless judged by  the investigator to be more severe than expected for 
the subject's condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs. 
6.9.4. Time Period and Frequency  of Detecting AEs and SA Es
The investigator or site staff is respons ible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 
AEs will be collected from the time the first dose of study  treatment is administered until 
28 day s following discontinuation of study  treatment regardless of initiation of a new 
cancer therap y or transfer to hospice. 
SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs. In addition, 
any SAE assessed as related to study  participation (e.g., protocol- mandated procedures, 
invasive tests, or cha nge in existing therapy ), study  treatment or GSK concomitant 
medication must be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study  
up to and including an y follow - up contact. All SAEs will be reported to GSK within 24 
hours, as indicated in Section 6.9.5.
After discontinuation of study  treatment, the investigator will monitor all AEs/SAEs that 
are ongoing until resolution or stabilization of the event or until the subject is lost to 
follow -
up. A t any time after 28 days the investigator may report an y adverse event that 
they believe possibly  related to study  treatment.  
6.9.5. Prompt Reporting of SA Es and Other Events to GSK
SAEs, pregnancies, and liver function abnormalities and an y other events meetin g pre -
defined criteria will be reported promptly  by the investigator to GSK as described in 
Table 20 once the investigator determines the event meets the protocol definition for that 
event.

provided in the SPM.
6.9.6. Regulatory  reporting requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification of SAEs by  the investigator to GSK is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towa rds the safet y of subjects are met.
GSK has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authorit y and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will 
comply  with country  specific regulatory  requ irements relating to safet y reporting to the 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
97regulatory  authorit y, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and investigators.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory  requirements and GSK policy  and are forwarded 
to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other 
specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with 
the IB and will notify  the I RB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
6.10. Pregnancy
6.10.1. Time period for collecting pregnancy  information
Reporting of an y pregnancies in female subjects and/or female partners of male subjects 
will b e collected after the start of dosing and until 7 months after the last dose of study  
drug.
6.10.2. Action to be taken if pregnancy  occurs
The investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any  female subject, who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this s tudy. The investigator will record pregnancy  
information on the appropriate form and submit it to GSK within 24 hours of learning of 
a subject's pregnancy . The subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy . Information on the stat us of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK. 
Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  
date. An y premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, an y pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded 
as an AE or SAE.
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. 
Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -study  pregnancy  and is considered 
reasonabl y related to the study  treatment by  the investigator, will be reported to GSK as 
described in Section 6.9.5 . While the investigator is not obligated to actively  seek this 
information in former study  participants, he or she may  learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.
Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will be withdrawn from 
the study .
6.10.3. Action to be taken if pregnancy  occur s in a female partner of a 
male study  subject
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  female partner of a 
male study  subject who becomes pregnant while participating in this study . The 
investigator will record pregnancy  inform ation on the appropriate form and submit it to 
GSK within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy . The partner will also be 
followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . Information on the status of the 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
98mother and child will be forwarded to G SK. Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 
6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  date. Any  premature termination of the 
pregnancy  will be reported.
Procedures for pregnancy report will be located in the SPM.
6.11. Pharmacogenetics
An important objec tive of the clinical study  is PGx research. Participation in PGx is 
optional but all subjects who are eligible for the clinical study  will be given the 
opportunity  to participate. Subjects may  decline participation without effect on their 
medical care or c are during the clinical study . A separate consent signature is required for 
PGx research.
Subjects who provide consent will have a blood sample taken for anal ysis. The 
presence/absence of genetic variations in host DNA from blood will be analy sed to 
determ ine their relationship with response (safet y, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
efficacy ) to treatment with GSK525762. 
Information regarding pharmacogenetic research is included in Appendix 1. In approving 
the clini cal protocol the IEC/I RB and, where required, the applicable regulatory  agency  
also approve the PGx assessments (i.e., approval of Appendix 1), unless otherwise 
indicated. Where permitted by  regulatory  authorities, approval of the PGx assessments 
can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the study . If so, then the written 
approval will clearl
y indicate approval of the PGx assessments is being deferred and the 
study , except for PGx assessments, can be initiated. When PGx assessments are not 
approved, then the approval for the rest of the study  will clearl y indicate this and 
therefore, PGx assessments will not be conducted.
7. STUDY TREA TMENTS
The term ‘stud y treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe a ny combination 
of products received b y the subject as per the protocol design. Stud y treatment may 
therefore refer to the individual study  treatments or the combination of those study  
treatments.
7.1. GSK525762 Investigational Product Dosage/A dministration
GSK5 25762 Tablets will be provided to sites by GSK. The contents of the label will be in 
accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements. An amorphous, free -base 
formulation of GSK525762 will be used in Part 1 (Table 21) and a cry stalline, bes ylate 
formulation ( Table 
22) will be introduced in the besy late sub -study  in Part 1 (US sites 
only) and the Part 2 expansion cohorts. After completion of the bes ylate sub -study  and 
introduction of besy late material for Part 2, remaining subjects ongoing in Part 1 were
required to change from the amorphous free -base formulation to the besy late formulation 
(at the equivalent dose) based on the amorphous supply  availability .
Under normal conditions of handling and administration, investigational product is not 
expected to pose significant safet y risks to site staff. A Material Safet y Data Sheet 
(MSDS) describing the occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions will 
be provide d to site staff if required b
y local laws or will otherwise be available from GSK 
upon request.

Sample accountability , return or destruction per institutions’ guidelines will be addr ess in 
the SPM. 
7.3. Meals and Dietary  Restrictions
During Part 1 ,
subjects will fast for at least one hour prior to each dose of study  drug. 
After dosing, subjects will be asked to fast for an additional two hours. On serial PK 
sampling day s (Week 1, Day  1 an d Week 3, Day  4), subjects should fast overnight (i.e., 
at least 8 hours). These fasting requirements have been implemented in the protocol and 
informed consents to minimize pharmacokinetic variability . 
During Bes ylate Sub -Study , subjects will be asked to fast overnight (at least 8 hours) and 
continue fasting for 4 hours post- dose administration except for the fed administration 
where subject will be requested to ingest a high -fat high- calorie meal within 30 minutes 
prior to administration ( FDA ,2002).
If a subject vomits after taking stud y drug, the subject should be instructed not to retake 
the dose and should take the next scheduled dose. Should a twice daily  regimen be 
required, additional consideration will be paid to fasting requirement sonce the escalation 
period is past.
In Part 2, based on the results of the besy late sub -study  showing a lack of effect of a 
high-fat high -calorie breakfast on the overall exposure (i.e. AUC) to GSK525762 
administered as bes ylate coa ted tablets, the fasting requirement is being lifted, except on 
Serial PK sampling day sin Part 2 (Week 1 and Week 4). On these day s,subjects should 
fast over night (i.e., at least 8 hours). After dosing, subjects will be asked to fast for an 
additional tw o hours. 
These fasting requirements have been implemented in the protocol 
and informed consents to minimize PK variability .
Fasting will consist of avoiding the oral ingestion of calorie –containing products; 
however, ingestion of water is permitted. 
Subjects should abstain from consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit, grapefruit 
hybrids or grapefruit juice and/or pomelos, exotic citrus fruits, from one day  prior to the 
first dose of study  treatment until the last dose of study  drug.
7.4. Treatment A ssignm ent
This is an open -labeled study .
Subjects will be identified by  a unique subject number that will remain consistent for the 
duration of the study . Subjects in Bes ylate Sub- Study  will be assigned to a treatment

102sequence (see Table 4) in accordance with the randomization schedule generated b y 
Discovery  Biometrics, using a validated software.
Upon completion of all the required screening assessments, eligible subjects will be 
registered into RAMOS (Registration and M edication Ordering Sy
stem), the GSK 
interactive voice response sy stem (IVRS) RAMOS, by  the investigator or authorized site 
staff. 
7.5. Product A ccountability
In accordance with local regulatory  requirements, the investigator, designated site staff, 
or head of the medical institution (where applicable) must document the amount of 
investigational product dispensed and/or administered to study  subjects, the amount 
returned b y stud y subjects, and the amount received from and returned to GSK, when 
applicable. Produc t accountability  records must be maintained throughout the course of 
the study . Refer to the SPM for further detailed instructions on product accountability .
7.6. Treatment Compliance
At each visit, an evaluation of subject compliance with taken medication will be 
performed. The investigator will make every  effort to bring non- compliant subjects into 
compliance. 
Compliance with GSK525762 will be assessed through query ing the subject during the 
site visits and documented in the source documents and CRF. 
A recor d of the number of GSK525762 tablets dispensed to and taken b y each subject 
must be maintained and reconciled with stud y treatment and compliance records. 
Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delay s and/or dose 
reductions will also be recorded in the CRF.
7.7. Dose Modifications
7.7.1. Dose and Safety  Management Guidelines
The following dose modification criteria should provide guidance for, but not act as a 
replacement for sound clinical judgment. The investigator should use clinical judgment to 
determine which drug may  be contributing to the toxicity  necessitating dose adjustment, 
and make the appropriate change for that drug. Further details are provided in the 
Appendix 3 .
Dose reductions for individual s ubjects may  be required, based on toxicity  observed 
during the stud y. Table 24describes the guidance for dose level reductions. All dose 
reductions should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor.

pharmacokinetics data and the safet y profile of prior cohorts, and will occur follo wing 
review of these data b y the investigator(s), GSK medical monitor, pharmacokineticist, 
and statistician. The decision and rationale will be documented in written format and 
distributed to the investigator(s), GSK medical monitor, pharmacokineticist, an d 
statistician. 
The dosing schedule may also be adjusted to expand a dosing cohort to further evaluate 
[safety , pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacody namic] findings at a given dose level, or to 
add cohorts to evaluate additional dose levels. The study  procedu res for these additional 
subject(s) or cohort(s) will be the same as that described for other stud y subjects.

THERA PIES
Subjects will be instructed to inform the investigator prior to starting an y new 
medications from t he Screening Visit until the end of the study  (Final Study Visit). Any  
concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations during the stud y will be 
recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement is that drug name, route of 
administration, dose and freq uency  of dosing, along with start and stop dates of 
administration should be recorded. Additionally , a complete list of all prior cancer 
therapies will be recorded in the eCRF.
If future changes are made to the list of permitted/prohibited medications, for mal 
documentation will be provided by  GSK and stored in the study  file. An y such changes 
will be communicated to the investigative sites in the form of a letter. 
8.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies
Subjects should receive full supportive care dur ing the stud y, including transfusions of 
blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and 
analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
110institutional guidelines. The only  caveat is that subjects should not receive those 
medications listed as prohibited in Section 8.2. 
Bisphosphonates will be allowed if subjects have been on a stable dose for at least three 
months.
Supportive measures including ery thropoi
etin, blood transfusions, and hematopoietic 
colony  stimulating factors for treatment of cy topenias are permitted. Ery thropoiesis-
stimulating agents and colony -stimulating factors like filgrastim and pegfilgrastim may  
be used as clinically indicated.
Drugs with a low risk of causing QTc prolongation (e.g., aprepitant) may  be used without 
restriction.
8.2. Prohibited Medications and Non-Drug Therapies
8.2.1. Prohibited Medications
Subjects should not receive other anti- cancer therapy  [including chemotherapy , radiation 
therapy, immunotherap y, biologic therap y, investigational therap y, hormonal therap y 
(other than leuprolide or other GnRH agonists), surgery  or tumor embolization] while on 
treatment in this study . Other anti -cancer therap y should not be administered unless o ne 
of the following occurs: documented disease progression; unacceptable or unmanageable 
toxicity ; subject is withdrawn from the stud y at the investigator’s discretion or consent is 
withdrawn; or no further clinical benefit is anticipated which requires pe rmanent 
discontinuation of study  drug. Note, palliative radiation and/or surgical intervention may  
be permitted (for example to address pain management) and should be discussed with the 
GSK medical monitor prior to invention to determine appropriate dosing and schedule. 
Subjects may  continue to use aspirin, but doses are not allowed to be greater than 100 mg 
per day . The use of non- steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) will be excluded, 
except for when NSAIDs will provide benefit over other analgesics and then to be used 
with caution ,including concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors .Subjects taking 
enzy me-inducing antiepileptic agents or other potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 
enzy mes should be transitioned to another agent at least 14 day s (or 5 half -lives, 
whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study  agents.
Anticoagulants at therapeutic doses (e.g., warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors, etc) are 
PROHIBITED from seven day s prior to the first dose of study
 drug through completion 
of the Final Study  Visit. Low dose (prophy lactic) anticoagulants are permitted provided 
that subject’s PT/PTT meet entry  criteria.  
If a subject requires medication for h yperemesis, due to the potential of serotonin 5- HT3 
receptor antagonists to increase QTcF, palonosetron (administered per the prescribing 
information) and ondansetron (at a maximum oral dose of 8 mg TID )are the only  
allowed drugs in this class (i.e. dolasetron and granisetron are not permitted)
.
Co-administration of the medications listed in Table 26 are prohibited for 5 half- lives (or 
at least 14 day s, whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study  drug until

the exceptio n of amiodarone, which is prohibited beginning 6 months prior to screening 
through d iscontinuation from the study ; however, there may  be situations when the 
subject is on study  and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACL S) requires the use of 
amiodarone, which should be used a s per local clinical guidelines). If a prohibited 
medication is required for single use (such as for a procedure) while stud y treatment(s) is 
held, the GSK Medical Monitor can approve such use.

1. The above table is not exhaustive and these drugs are defined by the online version at the time of screening of 
the subject
After starting cautionary  medications such as in Table 27, it is recommended that ECGs 
are implemented daily  until the steady  state. If there are abnormalities, implement 
additional cardi
otoxicity  monitoring as addressed in Table 24, Section 7.7.
GSK525762 is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Medications that have a narrow therapeutic 
index and that are substrates of CYP3A4 should be administered with caution, as their 
metabolism may  be affected by  co-administration with GSK525762 and result in 
decreased exposure. These include alfentanil, cy closporine, dihy droergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentan yl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, ta crolimus, and theophy lline. 
GSK525762 is a substrate for breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP )and P
-glycoprotein 
(Pgp)transporters. Therefore, potent inhibitors of these transporters, such as 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or ketoconazole, should be avoide d.
GSK525762 in as inhibitor of organic anion transporter 1A1 (OAT1) and organic anion 
transporter 3 (OAT3) in vitro. Substrates of these transporters include agents such as 
methotrexate, penicillin G, and indomethacin. While co-administration of these age nts 
with GSK525762 is not prohibited, they  should be used with caution and additional 
monitoring for adverse effects should be utilized.

113Higher doses of oral steroids can cause enzy me induction.  As such, oral steroids should 
be used with caution (and disc ussed with the GSK Medical Monitor).  NOTE:  Topical or 
inhaled steroids are permitted. 
Questions regarding concomitant medications should be directed to the GSK Medical 
Monitor for clarification.
8.3. Treatment after Discontinuation of Study  Treatment or 
Withdraw al from/Completion of Study
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given for the 
post-study  care of the subject’s medical condition whether or not GSK is providing 
specific post -study  treatment.
Refer to Section 4.2.4.1 and Section 5for follow -up assessment of subjects who are to be 
followed up for disease progression and/or survival after permanentl y discontinue from 
study  treatm ent.
8.4. Treatment of Study  Treatment Overdose
In the event of a study  drug overdose (defined as administration of more than the 
protocol -specified dose), the investigator should contact the GSK Medical Monitor 
immediately  and closel y monitor the subject for A Es/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities. 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by  the investigator 
in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the 
subject.
A plasma or urine sample for PK an alysis may  be requested by  the GSK Medical Monitor 
on a case -by-case basis. This plasma or urine sample should be collected as soon as 
possible, but within 3 day s from the date of the last dose of on- study  dosing. 
Information regarding the quantity  of the excess dose as well as the duration of the 
overdosing should be documented in the CRF.
9. LIFESTYLE REQUIREMEN TS (CONTRA CEPTION)
9.1. Female Subjects
Female subjects of childbearing potential must not become pregnant during the trial and 
for 7 months after stoppi ng stud y medication and so must be sexually  inactive by  
abstinence or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of ≤ 1%.
Abstinence
Sexual inactivity  by abstinence must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifesty le 
of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of co ntraception. 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
114Contraceptive Methods with a Failure Rate of 1%
Non-hormonal i ntrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine s ystem (IUS) that meets the 
≤1% failure rate as stated in the product label
Male partner sterilization (vasectom y with documentation of a zoospermia) prior to 
the female subject's entry into the study , and this male is the sole partner for that 
subject. For this definition, “documented” refers to the outcome of the 
investigator's/designee’s medical examination of the subject or review of the
subject's medical history  for study  eligibility , as obtained via a verbal interview with 
the subject or from the subject’s medical records.
These allowed methods of contraception are only  effective when used consistently , 
correctly  and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for 
ensuring subjects understand how to properl y use these methods of contraception.
All h ormonal means of birth control such as oral, injectable, dermal, subdermal or topical
contraceptives are NOT accept able forms of birth control given that their efficacy  has not 
been evaluated when given in combination with the investigational drugs.
9.2. Male Subjects
This list does not apply  to male subjects with a female partner of child bearing potential 
who are and will continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term 
and persistent basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifesty le. Periodic abstinence 
(e.g. calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are 
NOT ac ceptable methods of contraception.
Male subjects with female partners of child -bearing potential must use one of the 
following contraceptive methods after the first dose of study  treatment and until 16 weeks 
after the last dose of study  drug(s).
Vasectom ywith documentation of azoospermia. The documentation on male sterility  
can come from the site personnel’s: review of subject’s medical records, medical 
examination and/or semen anal ysis, or medical history  interview , OR
Condom use PL US partner use of a hi ghly effective contraceptive (
≤1% rate of 
failure per year) such as  intrauterine device or s ystem, or hormonal birth control 
such as contraceptive subdermal implant, combined estrogen and progestogen oral 
contraceptive, injectable progestogen, contraceptive vaginal ring, or percutaneo us 
contraceptive patches .
Male subjects whose partners are or become pregnant must continue to use condoms for 
16 weeks after after the last dose of study  medication. Male subjects should be advised 
not to donate sperm while on study  and for 16 weeks afte r the last dose of study  
medication .

11510. DATA MANAG EMENT
Subject data will be collected using defined electronic case report forms (eCRFs), 
transmitted electronically to GSK and combined with data provided from other sources in 
a validated data s ystem. 
In all cases, subject initials will not be collected or transmitted to GSK according to GSK 
policy .
11. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERA TIONS
11.1. Sample Size Assumptions
11.1.1. Part 1
The total number of subjects to be enrolled into Part 1will depend on the number of do se 
escalations required to establish the maximum tolerated dose of GSK525762; they  are not 
driven by  statistical considerations. To complete Part 1, it is estimated that 90to 110
evaluable subjects will be enrolled. 
Doses to be studied in Part 1 will be guided b y calculating the posterior probability  that  
the DLT rate falls within an acceptable range for each subsequent dose after each dose 
cohort observation period.  The N-CRM method will be used to calculate posterior 
probabilities utilizing a pre- specified prior distribution.
11.1.2. Besy late Sub -Study
At least 8 and up to 12 US subjects will participate in Bes ylate Sub -Study .  
Approximately  12 subjects will participate in the assessment to get at least 8 evaluable 
patients completing.  A subject is considere d a completer if they  have PK assessments 
from all treatment periods.
Based on a within -subject coefficient of variance for AUC of 50%, a correlation of 0.95 
between the enriched (liquid dose of GSK525762 added) and non- enriched PK, and 8 
subjects completi ng in Besy late Sub -Study , it is estimated that the half -width of the 90% 
CI for the ratio of the geometric means (bes ylate salt tablet compared to the amorphous 
free-base tablet) will be approximately  0.20.  Hence, if the ratio estimate is equal to 1, the 
90% CI  will be 0.80 to 1.25.
11.1.3. Part 2
The primary  goal of Part 2 is to evaluate disease -specific efficacy  in subjects with NMC, 
SCLC, CRPC, TNBC , ER+BC and GIST .
For NMC, efficacy  is defined as a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined as 
the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR or PR) of 20% relative to a 5% 
response rate suggesting no activity
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
116For CRPC and SCL C, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate 
(defined as a percentage of subjects that have achieved as CR or PR; for CRPC 
subjects, defined as a percentage of subjects have PSA50 response ) of 30% 
relative to a 10% response rate suggesting no activity .
For TNBC, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined as 
a percentage of subjects that have a chieved as CR or PR) of 25% relative to a 
10% response rate suggesting no activity
.
For ER+BC, efficacy  is defined as a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined 
as a percentage of subjects that have achieved as CR or PR) of 30% relative to a 
15% respon se rate suggesting no activity .
For GIST , efficacy  is defined as a disease control rate (defined as a percentage of 
subjects that have achieved a CR or PR or SD that has lasted at least 16 weeks) of 
40% relative to a 15 % disease control rate suggesting no activity .
Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the predictive probability  that the 
response rate is greater than the historic response rate at interim anal yses using a 
weak/non -informative prior. A Bay esian analy sis expresses uncertaint y about a parameter 
in terms of probability .  A prior distribution is defined to characterize the level of 
knowledge about a parameter before the data are collected.  Once the data are collected, a 
posterior distribution is formed using the prior distribution and the observed data.  A very  
weak prior Beta distribution with a mean response rate equal to the target response rate is 
assumed.  Thus, the posterior distribution for the response rate will be primarily driven b y 
the data and can be derived as follows:
Letp denote the response rate, the number of responses in the current n subjects, x, 
follows a binomial distribution, Binomial (n, p).  Taking the Bay esian method and 
combining the prior distribution and the observed data x, the posterior distribution of the
response rate follows a beta distribution, i.e.
In the following case, 30% is the target response rate.
p Beta (0.03 + x, 0.07 + n- x) with the posterior mean (0.03+ x)/(0.07 + n).
Futility  anal ysis for each disease cohort will begin when response data i s available for at 
least 10 subjects. Each disease cohort may  be stopped earl y for futility  if the predictive 
probability  of success ( response rate ≥ historical response rate) is less than 1%.  Futility  
stopping rules are defined for each cohort in Section 3.2.7.
The following table describes for each disease cohort the null and alternative hypotheses 
that will be tested, maximum sample size and design characteristics.  Each maximum 
sample size was calculated to ensure that at least 80% power and a maximum ty pe 1 error 
rate of 10% is maintained.

11.1.5. Sample Size Re -estimation
No sample size re -estimation will be performed.
11.1.6. Subset A nalysis for NMC Population
An exploratory  review for NMC molecular subt ype (e.g. NUT -BRD3, N UT-BRD4, and 
NUT -NSD3) will be conducted.
11.2. Analysis Populations
All Treated Subjects (Safety and Clinical Activity) Population: This will consist of all 
subjects that received at least one dose of study  treatment. Safet y and clinical activity 
data will be e valuated based on this population.
The PK Population: This will consist of those subjects in All Subjects Population and 
for whom a PK sample is obtained and analy zed.
Pharmacodynamic Population: The PD Population is defined as subjects in the All 
Treated Subjects Population for whom a tumor biopsy  or tissue was obtained and 
analysed for biomarkers.

BET115521
11811.3. Data Analysis Considerations
Data will be listed and summarized according to the GSK reportin g standards, where 
applicable. Complete details will be documented in the RAP. Any deviations from, or 
additions to, the original anal ysis plan described in this protocol will be documented in 
the RAP and final study  report.
As it is anticipated that accru al will be spread thinly  across centers and summaries of data 
by center would be unlikely  to be informative, data from all participating centers will be 
pooled prior to anal ysis. 
All data up to the time of study  completion/withdrawal from study  will be in cluded in the 
analysis, regardless of duration of treatment. 
As the duration of treatment for a given subject will depend on efficacy  and tolerability , 
the duration of follow -up will vary  between subjects. Consequently  there will be no 
imputation for miss ing data. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized.
11.3.1. Interim A nalysis
An interim anal ysis of the key  parameters may be carried- out before the conclusion of the 
study .
Full details of procedures and of the anal yses planned at the interim analysis will 
be provided in the Reporting and Anal ysis Plan ( RAP ).
The study  will not utilize an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).
11.3.2. Final A nalyses
Final anal ysis on Part 1 may  be conducted when 
Part 1 is completed 
or at least 70% of subject senrolled in every  dose group at Part 1 are completed or 
progressed or died.
Final anal yses will be carried -out following the DBF (data base frozen) after all the data 
queries has been resolved .
11.3.3. Analysis Datasets
The construction of analy sis data sets wil l be performed in accordance with all applicable 
GlaxoSmithKline standards and procedures.
11.3.4. Withdrawal
Reason for subject withdrawal will be listed.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
11911.3.5. Missing Data
Missing data will not be imputed. Where appropriate, available data will be summarized 
over spe cified intervals (e.g., from start of treatment until withdrawal from study ) using 
suitable summary  statistics.
11.3.6. Derived and Transformed Data
The PK parameters, AUC, Cmax, and terminal half -life will be log -transformed prior to 
analysis.
11.3.7. Assessment Windows
Safety  assessments that occur prior to the administration of study  drug will be considered 
screening assessments. Safet y assessments that occur after dosing has begun will be 
considered as having occurred while on treatment.
Disease assessments will be distinguished as belonging to either screening, continued 
therap y or post -study  phases of the study .
11.3.8. Other Issues
Data from participating centers will be pooled b y tumor cohort prior to analysis. It is 
anticipated that subject accrual may  be limited across ce nters and summaries of data b y 
center would likel y not be informative. Therefore, these summaries will not be provided.
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized.
For PK analy ses, assay  values below the quantitative limit (BQL) will be ha ndled as 
described in the GSK 
Creatine phosphokinase (CPK)/M &S PK Methods.
There will be no adjustments for multiplicity .
11.4. Efficacy  Analyses
11.4.1. Primary  Analysis
For Part 1, anti -tumor activities will be evaluated based on clinical evidence and response 
criteri a. If the data warrant, the response data will be summarized by dose level.
The primary  aim of Part 2 is to demonstrate clinically  meaningful response rates in each 
of the disease cohorts separatel y. 
Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of s ubjects who achieved CR or PR 
among subjects who received at least one dose of treatment. Overall response rate and the 
associated 2-sided 95% exact confidence limits will be provided separatel y for each 
disease cohort.
PSA 50 R esponse rate (RR) is defined as the response rate that a PSA reduction from 
baseline ≥50% is observed at 12 weeks and bey ond(must be confirmed b y a second 
value). RR will be reported for CRPC cohort along with the exact 95% confidence 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
120interval. Waterfall plots will be presented that show the maximum percentage of change 
in PSA reduction from baseline.
Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the percentag e of subjects who achieved CR, 
PR or SD 
(defined as ≥ 16 weeks in duration) among subjects who received at least one 
dose of treatment. Disease control rate and the associated 2 -sided 95% exact confidence 
limits will be provided separatel y for GISTcohort .
11.4.2. Secondary  Analyses
For the anal ysis of PFS, if the subject received subsequent anti -cancer therapy  prior to the 
date of documented events, PFS will be censored at the last adequa te assessment (e.g. 
assessment where visit level response is CR, PR, or SD) prior to the initiation of therap y. 
Otherwise, if the subject does not have a documented date of events, PFS will be 
censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. For the a nalysis of overall survival 
(OS), the last date of known contact will be used for those subjects who have not died at 
the time of anal ysis; such subjects will be considered censored. Further details on rules 
for censoring will be provided in the RAP. Sensi tivity  anal yses of PFS and further details 
on censoring rules will be provided in the RAP.  Progression free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier method.
The duration of response is defined for the subject or subjects with a confirmed CR or 
PR, as the time from the first documented evidence of a CR or PR until the first 
documented disease progression or death due to any  cause. Censoring rules for duration 
of response will be outlined in detail in the RAP.
Time to Re sponse is defined, for subjects with a confirmed CR or PR, as the time from 
first dose to the first documented evidence of CR or PR.
If sample size permits, duration of response and time to response will be summarized 
descriptivel y using Kaplan- Meier media ns and quartiles. Only  the subset of subjects who 
show a confirmed complete or partial tumor response will be included. Censoring rules 
for duration of response will follow the rules for PFS outlined in detail in the RAP.
11.5. Safet y Analyses
Safety endpoints a re described in Section 2. 
The All Subject population will consist of all subjects receiving at least one dose of stud y 
drug and will be used for the anal ysis of safety  data. Complete details of the safet y 
analyses will be provided in the RAP.
A listing by  subject including treatment administered, and compliance, will be generated 
with dates and times of treatment administered. The number of subjects exposed to study  
drug will be tabulated for Part 1 (for each d ose cohort) and Part 2.
Adverse events will be coded and grouped b y system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
(coded) term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
system for adverse event coding. AEs will be graded according to th e National Cancer

Clinical laboratory  evaluations will be performed on the day s specified in the Time and 
Events Table s. Clinical chemistry , coagulation, hematology  and urinaly sis values and 
change from baseline values will be listed for each subject and flagged high or low 
relative to their normal ranges, where applicable. The toxicity  grade for laboratory  data 
will be calculated using NCI  CTCAE Version 4. The lab data will then be summarized 
according to the subject’s baseline grade and maximum grade for each cy cle of therapy . 
A listing of subjects with potentially  clinicall y important lab abnormalities will also be 
produced. A summary  of lab values and ch ange from (baseline) may  be done for Part 1 
(for each dose cohort) and Part 2.
Vital signs and ECG data will be listed and summarized for Part 1(for each dose cohort)

All other relevant safet y data will be listed and summarized according to the GSK IDSL 
standards as well.
All data will be listed. Further details will b e provided in the RAP.
11.5.1. Extent of Exposure
Extent of exposure of GSK525762 will depend on tolerability of the subjects to the doses 
administered and the course of their disease. The number of subjects exposed to 
GSK525762 will be summarized for each dose le vel administered.
11.5.2. Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GlaxoSmithKline Medical 
Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) and grouped by  system organ class. AEs 
will be graded b y the investigator according to the NCI -CTCA E (version 4.0). 
Events will be summarized by  frequency  and proportion of total subjects, by  system 
organ class and preferred term. Separate summaries will be given for all AEs, drug -
related AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of study  treatment.
If the AE is listed in the NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) table, the maximum grade will be 
summarized.

11.5.3. Clinical Laboratory  Eval uations
Hematology  and clinical chemistry  data will be summarized at each scheduled 
assessment according to NCI  CTCAE grade (version 4.0). The proportion of values l ying 
outside the reference range will also be presented for laboratory  tests that are not g raded 
because there are no associated NCI CTCAE criteria. Summaries will include data from 
scheduled assessments only , and all data will be reported according to the nominal visit 
date for which it was recorded (i.e. no visit windows will be applied). Unscheduled data 
will be included in “overall” and “an y post -screening” summaries which will capture a 
worst case across all scheduled and unscheduled visits post first dose of study  treatment. 
Further details will be provided in the RAP.
11.6. Pharmacokinetic Analy ses
11.6.1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters
PK analy ses will be the responsibility  of Clinical Pharmacokinetics/Modelling & 
Simulation, GSK. Plasma GSK525762 and relevant metabolites, as appropriate, 
concentration -time data from dose escalation (Part 1) will be anal yzed by non-
compartmental methods with WinNonlin.
From the plasma concentration -time data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters will 
be determined, as data permit: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to 
Cmax (tmax), area under the plasma co ncentration -time curve (AUC(0-t) and AUC(0- ∞) 
Week1 Day 1 onl y) and apparent terminal phase half -life (t½). Trough concentration (C ) 
samples collected on the specified day s will be used to assess attainment of steady  state. 
To estimate the extent of accumu lation after repeat dosing, the observed accumulation 
ratio (Ro) may  be determined. The ratio of AUC(0 -) on Week 3 / AUC(0-∞ ) on Week 1 
will be calculated to assess time invariance. GSK525762 concentrations will be 
determined in urine samples to determine urinary  recovery  of unchanged drug and renal 
clearance.
11.6.2. Statistical analy sis of pharmacokinetic parameters
Statistical analy ses of the PK parameters data will be conducted by  Discovery  
Biometrics, GSK. Plasma concentration -time data will be listed by  dose , age group, and 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) 
by planned relative assessment time. Mean and/ or median values will be plotted over 
time. I ndividual plasma and urinary  (if available) pharmacokinetic parameters values as 
well as a descriptive summary  (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, 
geometric mean, and the standard deviation, CV% and 95% confidence interval of log -
transformed parameters (if applicable)) b y dose cohort and age group will be reported. 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
123Dose proportionality 
Cmax and AUC (AUC(0- ∞), single dose, and AUC(0 -), stead y state) from Part 1 will be 
plotted as a function of the dose administered. If more than 2 dose cohorts are required to 
reach MTD (or the recommended dose based on available safet y, PK and response d ata), 
dose proportionality  of AUC and Cmax for GSK525762 following single dose 
administration and AUC(0- ) and Cmax following repeat dose administration will be 
assessed graphically and using the power model as described below:
log (pharmacokinetic parameter) = a + b * log(dose)
where a is the intercept and b is the slope.
The power model will be fitted by  restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using SAS 
Proc Mixed.  Both the intercept and slope will be fitted as fixed effects.  If there is 
sufficient data, t he model may  also be fit with the intercept and/or slope as random 
effects depending on the ability  of the model to converge and on estimation of variance-
covariance matrix.  The mean slope and corresponding 90% confidence interval will be 
estimated from the power model.  
Separate models will be evaluated for amorphous tablet and bes ylate salt.
Relative bioavailability of the besylate salt tablet to the amorphous tablet ( Besylate 
Sub-Study)
Based on the US FDA guidance on relative bioavailability  studies, two formulations will 
be considered bioequivalent if the 90% CI of the ratio for Cmax and AUC, based on log -
transformed data, is within the 80 to 125% equivalence limit. Recommendation on the 
dose amount impact of a deviation from bioequivalence with the besylate salt will be 
based on the magnitude of the change.
Food effect with besylate salt tablet (Besylate Sub -Study)
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters AUC(0 -∞), and Cmax will be loge -transformed and 
analyzed using a mixed-effects model with and without food will be anal yzed separately  
with fixed -effect terms for fed status (fed or fasted), and subject as a random effect. P oint 
estimates and their associated 90% CIs will be constructed for the differences between 
fed and in fasted state. The point estimates and their associated 90% CIs were then 
backtransformed to provide point estimates and 90% CIs for the ratios of fed/fasted.
Non-parametric methods such as the Hodges and Lehmann estimator will be used to
estimate the median differences between the fed treatments and the fasted state
treatments for tmax. An associated 90% CI for the median differences will be 
constructed.
Based on the US FDA guidance on food -effect bioavailability  studies, the absence of a
food-effect will be established if the 90% CI of the ratio for Cmax and AUC, based on
log-transformed data, is within the 80 to 125% equivalence limit. Recommendation on
the clinical significance of the effect of food will be based on the magnitude of the 
change and our understanding of the exposure -clinical response relationship.

BET115521
124For the evaluation of food effect, tmax at fed and fasted status will be presented b y 
subjec t and dose cohort in tabular and graphical form.
11.6.3. Population Pharmacokinetic A nalysis
Plasma concentration-time data from parts 1 and 2 will be combined and may  be 
combined with data from other studies 
and further anal yzed using a population approach. 
A no nlinear mixed effects model will be used to determine population pharmacokinetic 
parameters (absorption rate, Ka, apparent clearance, CL /F and volume of distribution, 
V/F) and summary  exposure measures (Cmax, AUC and Cav = AUC/ ) and identify  
important covariates (e.g., age, weight, or disease related covariates).
11.7. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacody namic Analy ses
Observed (Part 1) or predicted concentrations (Part 2) will be combined with safet y and 
efficacy  pharmacod ynamic measures of interest to examine potential exposure response 
relationships.
The relationship between QTcF and concentration expressed as Cmax, Cav, and/or 
instantaneous time -matched concentration will be evaluated. A linear or non- linear mixed 
effects anal ysis of the relationship between  QTcF adju sted for baseline and –
concentration with a possible incorporation of time will be evaluated as a means of 
estimating QTcF effect in lieu of a thorough QT study .
Other quantitative safet y parameters and biomarkers of interest will be plotted 
graphicall y against summary  exposure measures (eg; Cmax, Ctrough, and Cav). Where 
evidence of a signal is seen, linear and non -linear mixed effect models will be fitted to 
the data to estimate PKPD parameters of interest; slope, baseline (E0), concentration for 
50% of m aximum effect (EC50) and maximum effect (Emax).
Overall efficacy  data, as assessed by  conventional RECI ST 1.1 criteria (best confirmed 
response) and overall tumor burden, may  be described using ordered categorical model 
and continuous models with summary  exposure parameters (eg; Cmax, Ctrough, and 
Cav) as covariates derived from the population PK anal ysis. Further model details will be 
provided in the Reporting and Anal ysis Plan [RAP].
11.8. Translational Research A nalyses
Exploratory  anal ysis may be performed to examine potential relationships between 
anticancer activity  and changes in markers of BET target inhibition or tumor biology  (e.g. 
cytokines, acute phase proteins, relevant transcripts and/or proteins) or between 
anticancer activity  and potential markers of sensitivity .
The results of translational research investigations may  be reported separately  from the 
main clinical study  report or as an amendment. All endpoints of interest from all 
comparisons will be descriptively  and/or graphically  summarized as ap propriate to the 
data. Further details on the translational research anal yses will be addressed in the RAP.

2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
12612.4. Qualit y Control (Study  Monitoring)
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures, the site will be 
contacted prior to the start of the study  to review with the site staff the protocol, study  
requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory , ethical, and GSK 
requirements. When reviewing data collection proce dures, the discussion will include 
identification, agreement and documentation of data items for which the CRF will serve 
as the source document.
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate their time and 
the time to their staff to monitor to discuss findings and an y issues.
Monitoring visits will be conducted in a manner to ensure that the:
Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected.
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol and any  other 
study  agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory  requirements.
12.5. Qualit y Assurance
To ensure compliance with I CH GCP and al l applicable regulatory  requirements, GSK 
may conduct qualit y assurance audits of the site. Regulatory agencies may conduct a 
regulatory  inspection at any  time during or after completion of the study . In the event of 
an audit or inspection, the investigator (and institution) must agree to grant the auditor(s) 
and inspector(s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate their time and the 
time of their staff to discuss any  findings/relevant issues.
12.6. Stud y and Site Closure
The end of the stud y date is defined as last subject last visit (contact). 
Upon completion or termination of the study , the monitor will conduct site closure 
activities with the investigator or site staff (as appropriate), in accordance with applicable 
regulations, I CH GCP, and G SK Standard Operating Procedures.
GSK reserves the right to temporaril y suspend or terminate the stud y at an y time for 
reasons including (but not limited to) safety  issues, ethical issues, or severe 
noncompliance. If GSK determines that such action is requ ired, GSK will discuss the 
reasons for taking such action with the investigator or head of the medical institution 
(where applicable). When feasible, GSK will provide advance notice to the investigator 
or head of the medical institution of the impending ac tion.
If a stud y is suspended or terminated for safet y reasons, GSK will promptly  inform all 
investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where applicable),and/or institutions 
conducting the study . GSK will also promptly  inform the relevant regulatory authorities 
of the suspension/termination along with the reasons for such action. Where required b y 
applicable regulations, the investigator or head of the medical institution must inform the 
IRB/IEC promptly  and provide the reason(s) for the suspension/t ermination.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
127GSK may  close sites which fail to recruit within a predefined timeframe, as defined 
within the Study  Procedures Manual.
12.7. Records Retention
Following closure of the study , the investigator or head of the medical institution (where 
applicable) must maintain all site study  records (except for those required by  local 
regulations to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and secure location. The records must 
be easil y accessible when needed (e.g., for a GSK audit or regulatory inspection) and 
must be avai lable for review in conjunction with assessment of the facility , supporting 
systems, and relevant site staff.
Where permitted b y local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of the 
records may  be maintained in a format other than hard copy  (e.g., microfiche, scanned, 
electronic); however, caution must be exercised before such action is taken. The 
investigator must ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate 
copy  of the original. In addition, they  must meet accessibil ity and retrieval standards, 
including regeneration of a hard cop y, if required. The investigator must also ensure that 
an acceptable back -up of the reproductions exists and that there is an acceptable quality  
control procedure in place for creating the re productions.
GSK will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining the site records in order 
to comply  with all applicable regulatory  requirements. The minimum retention time will 
meet the strictest standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated b y local 
laws/regulations, GSK standard operating procedures, and/or institutional requirements.
The investigator must notify  GSK of any  changes in the archival arrangements, including, 
but not limited to archival of records at an off- site facilit y or transfer of ownership of the 
records in the event that the investigator is no longer associated with the site.
12.8. Provision of Study  Results to Investigators, Posting to the 
Clinical Trials Register and Publication
Where required b y applicable regulatory requirements, an investigator signatory  will be 
identified for the approval of the clinical study  report. The investigator will be provided 
reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the 
opportunity  to review the complete study  results at a GSK site or other mutually -
agreeable location.
GSK will also provide the investigator with the full summary  of the stud y results. The 
investigator is encouraged to share the summary  results with the study  subjects, as 
appropriat e.

13214. APPENDICES
14.1. Appendix 1 : Pharmacogenetic Research
Pharmacogenetics –Background
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is the study  of variabili ty in drug response due to hereditary  
factors in populations. There is increasing evidence that an individual's genetic 
background (i.e., genot ype) may  impact the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, elimination), pharmacod ynamics (relat ionship between concentrations and 
pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) and/or clinical 
outcome (in terms of efficacy  and/or safety  and tolerability ). Some reported examples of 
PGx associations with safety /adverse events inclu de:
PGx A ssociations with Safety  Events
Drug Disease Gene Outcome
Abacavir HIV 
[Hetherington ,2002; 
Mallal , 2002]HLA-B 
(Human 
Leukocyte 
Antigen B)Carriage of the HLA -B*5701 variant has 
been shown to increase a patient's risk for 
experiencing hypersensitivity to abacavir. 
Prospective HLA -B*5701 screening and 
exclusion of HLA -B*5701 positive patients 
from abacavir treatment significantly 
decreased the incidence of abacavir 
hypersensitivity. Treatment guidelines and 
abacavir product labeling in the United 
States and Europe now recommend (US) 
or require (EU) prospective HLA- B*5701 
screening prior to initiation of abacavir to 
reduce the incidence of abacavir 
hypersensitivity. H LA-B*5701 screening 
should supplement but must never replace 
clinical risk management strategies for 
abacavir hypersensitivity.
Carbamazepine Seizure, Bipolar 
disorders & 
Analgesia
[Chung , 2010]HLA-
B*1502Independen t studies indicated that patients 
carrying HLA -B*1502 are at higher risk of 
Stevens -Johnson Syndrome and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis and that this marker is 
prevalent in some populations, particularly 
with Asian ancestry. Regulators, including 
the US FDA an d the Taiwanese TFDA, 
have updated the carbamazepine drug 
label to indicate that screening is justified in 
patients with ancestry in populations in 
which HLA -B*1502 may be present.

BET115521
133Drug Disease Gene Outcome
Irinotecan Cancer [ Innocenti , 
2004; Liu, 2008]UGT1A1 Variations in the UGT1A1 gene can 
influence a patient’s ability to break down 
irinotecan, which can lead to increased 
blood levels of the drug and a higher risk of 
side effects. A dose of irinotecan that is 
safe for one patient with a particular 
UGT1A1 gene variation might be too high 
for another patient without this variation, 
raising the risk of certain side -effects, that 
include neutropenia following initiation of 
Irinotecan treatment. The irinote can drug 
label indicates that individuals who are 
homozygous for UGT1A1*28 allele are at 
increased risk of neutropenia A genetic 
blood test (Invader UGT1A1 molecular 
assay) is available that can detect 
variations in the gene.  
A key  component to success ful PGx research is the collection of samples during the 
conduct of clinical studies.
Collection of whole blood samples, even when no a priori hy pothesis has been identified, 
may enable PGx anal ysis to be conducted if at any time it appears that there is a potential 
unexpected or unexplained variation in handling or response to GSK525762.
Pharmacogenetic Research Objectives
The objective of the PGx research (if there is a potential unexpected or unexplained 
variation) is to investigate a possible genetic re lationship to handling or response to 
GSK525762.  If at an y time it appears there is potential variability  in response in this 
clinical study  or in a series of clinical studies with GSK525762 that may  be attributable 
to genetic variations of subjects, the following objectives may  be investigated – the 
relationship between genetic variants and stud y treatment with respect to:
Pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacod ynamics of study  treatment,
Safety  and/or tolerability, and
Efficacy .
Study Population
Any subject wh o is enrolled in the clinical study  can participate in the PGx research. Any  
subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from 
the PGx research.
Subject participation in the PGx research is voluntary  and refusal to participate will not 
indicate withdrawal from the clinical study . Refusal to participate will involve no penalt y 
or loss of benefits to which the subject would otherwise be entitled.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
134Study Assessments and Procedures
In addition to any  blood samples taken for the clinical study , a whole blood sample 
(~10mL) will be collected for the PGx research using a tube containing EDTA. I t is 
recommended that the blood sample be taken at the first opportunity  after a subject has 
been randomized and provided informed consent for PGx research, but may be taken at 
any time while the subject is participating in the clinical study .
The PGx sample is labelled (or “coded”) with a study  specific number that can be traced 
or linked back to the subject b y the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry  
personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). The blood sample is taken 
on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to inability  to utilize the 
original sample. 
The DNA extracted from the blood sample may  be subjected to sample quality  control 
analysis. This anal ysis will involve the genot yping of several genetic markers to confirm 
the integrit y of individual samples. If inconsistencies are noted in the anal ysis, then those 
samples may
 be destr oyed. 
The need to conduct PGx anal ysis may  be identified after a study  (or set of studies) of 
GSK525762 has been completed and the study data reviewed. In some cases, the samples 
may not be studied. e.g., no questions are raised about how people respond t o 
GSK525762. 
Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject 
completes the study  or GSK may  destro y the samples sooner. GSK or those working with 
GSK (for example, other researchers) will use samples collected fro m the study  for the 
purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. 
Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any  time.
Subject Withdrawal from Study
If a subject who has consented to participate in PGx research and has a samp le taken for 
PGx research withdraws from the clinical study  for any  reason other than lost to follow -
up, the subject will be given the following options:
The sample is retained for PGx research.
Any PGx sample is destroy ed.
If a subject withdraws consent f rom the PGx research or requests sample destruction for 
any reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request 
sample destruction within the timeframe specified by  GSK and maintain the 
documentation in the site study  records. In either case, GSK will only  keep study  
information collected/generated up to that point.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
135Screen and Baseline Failures
If a blood sample for PGx research has been collected and it is determined that the 
subject does not meet the entry  criteria for particip ation in the clinical study, then the 
investigator should instruct the participant that their PGx sample will be discarded. No 
forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent 
and sample reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be 
available to include in the site files.
Pharmacogenetics A nalyses
1.Specific genes may  be studied that encode the drug targets, or mechanism pathways, 
drug metabolizing enzy mes, or which may  underpin advers e events, disease risk or 
drug response. These candidate genes may  include a common set of ADME 
(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) genes that are studied to 
determine the relationship between gene variants and treatment response and/or 
tolerance. 
In addition, continuing research may  identify  other enzy mes, transporters, proteins or 
receptors that may  be involved in response to GSK525762. The genes that may  code for 
these proteins may  also be studied.
2.Genome -wide scans involving a large number of poly morphic markers (e.g., single 
nucleotide poly morphisms) at defined locations in the genome, often correlated with 
a candidate gene, may  be studied to determine the relationship between genetic 
variants and treatment response or tolerance. This approach is often employ ed when 
a definitive candidate gene(s) does not exist and/or the potential genetic effects are 
not well understood. 
If applicable and PGx research is conducted, appropriate statistical anal ysis methods will 
be used to evaluate phar macogenetic data in the context of the other clinical data. Results 
of PGx investigations will be reported either as part of the main clinical study  report or as 
a separate report. Endpoints of interest from all comparisons will be descriptively  and/or 
graphicall y summarized as appropriate to the data. A detailed description of the anal ysis 
to be performed will be documented in the study  reporting and anal ysis plan (RAP) or in 
a separate pharmacogenetics RAP, as appropriate. 
Informed Consent
Subjects who d o not wish to participate in the PGx research may  still participate in the 
clinical study . PGx informed consent must be obtained prior to an y blood being taken for 
PGx research.

136Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality  of Subject’s PGx Data
GSK may  summarize the cumulative the PGx research results in the clinical study  report 
or may  publish the results in scientific journals.

13714.2. Appendix 2 : Cockcroft-Gault Formula
The Cockcroft -Gault formula is a commonly -used surrogate marker for actual creatinine 
clearance (CrCl) and employ s creatinine measurements and a subject's weight (kg) to 
predict the clearance. 
If the subject is obese (>30% over ideal body weight ), use ideal bod y weight in 
calculation of estimate CrCl.
If the subject is below ideal body weight, use actual body  weight in calculation of 
estimate CrCl.
Cockcroft -Gault Formula for serum creatinine in mmol/L
CrCl (mL/min)= Q X (140 -age [years]) X actual body weight (kg)a
48816 X serum creatinine (mmol/L)
Q=0.85 for females
Q=1.0 for males
OR
a. Calculation of Ideal Body  Weight Using the Devine Formula [ Devine , 1974]
Male subjects:
50.0 kg + (2.3 kg X each inch over 5 feet)
or
50.0 kg + (0.906 kg X each cm over 152.4 cm)
Female subjects:
45.5 kg + (2.3 kg X each inch over 5 feet)
or
45.5 kg + (0.906 kg X each cm over 152.4 cm) 4 cm)
Cockcroft -Gault Formula for serum cr eatinine in mg/dL
For example:
For a male subject with actual body weight = 90.0 kg and height = 68 inches, the 
calculation would be as follows:
Ideal bod y weight= 50.0 + (2.3) (68 -60) = 68.4 kg
This subject’s actual body weight is >30% over ideal body weight. In this case, the 
subject’s ideal body weight of 68.4 kg should be used in calculating estimated creatinine 
clearance.

14114.3.2.1. Rechallenge Following Liver Stopping Events that are Possibly  Related 
to Study  Treatment
Following drug -induced liver injury , drug rechallenge is associated w ith a 13% 
mortality across all drugs in prospective studies [Andrade , 2009]. Clinical outcomes 
vary by drug, with nearl y 50% fatalit y with halothane readministered within one month 
of initial injury . However, some dr ugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatalit y. 
Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include:
hypersensitivity  with initial liver injury  (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia) 
[Andrade ,2009] 
jaundi ce or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury  (direct bilirubin >35% of 
total)
subject currently exhibits severe liver injury  defined by : ALT 3xUL N, 
bilirubin 2xUL N (direct bilirubin >35% of total), or INR1.5
serious adverse event or fatality  has ear lier been observed with drug 
rechallenges [ Papay , 2009]
evidence of drug- related preclinical liability  (e.g. reactive metabolites; 
mitochondrial impairment [ Hunt , 2010])
Rechallenge refers to resuming study  treatment following drug induced liver injury  
(DILI). Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI this should only  be 
considered for a subject for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical 
or lif e-saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a 
benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favourable.
Approval b y GSK for rechallenge with study treatment can be considered where:
Investigator requests conside ration of rechallenge with study  treatment for a subject 
who is receiving compelling benefit with study  treatment that exceeds risk, and no 
effective alternative therapy  is available. 
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval for rechallenge with study  
treatment must be obtained, as required.  
If the rechallenge is approved by GSK Medical Governance in writing, the subject 
must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of study  
treatment administration, includin g the possibility  of recurrent, more severe liver 
injury  or death. 
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the 
rechallenge with study  treatment. Documentation of informed consent must be 
recorded in the study  chart. 
Study  treatment must be administered at the dose specified b y GSK.
Subjects approved b y GS K Medical Governance for rechallenge with stud y 
treatment must return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry  tests until stable 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
142liver chemistries have been demonstra ted and then standard laboratory  monitoring 
may resume as per protocol.
If after study treatment rechallenge, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistry  
stopping criteria, study  treatment should be permanently  discontinued. 
Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board as 
required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following stud y treatment 
rechallenge. 
GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section 6.9.
14.3.2.2. Restart Following Transie nt Resolving Liver Stopping Events NOT 
Related to Study  Treatment
Restart refers to resuming stud y treatment following liver stopping events in which there 
is a clear underl ying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary  obstruction, 
pancreat ic events, hy potension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there should be no 
evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hy persensitivity, and the study  treatment should not be 
associated with HLA markers of liver injury
.
Approval b y GSK for study treatment rest art can be considered where:
Investigator requests consideration for stud y treatment restart if liver chemistries 
have a clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary  obstruction, hy potension and liver 
chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T 
<3xUL N).
Restart risk factors (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hy persensitivity , alcoholic 
hepatitis, possible study  treatment -induced liver injury  or study  treatment has an 
HLA genetic marker associated with liver injury  (e.g. lapatinib, aba cavir, 
amoxicillin/clavulanate) are reviewed and excluded
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of study  treatment restart 
must be obtained, as required.
If restart of stud y treatment is approved b y GSK Medical Governance in writing, the 
subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of 
study  treatment administration, including the possibility  of recurrent, more severe 
liver injury  or death. 
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specif ically for the study  
treatment restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study  
chart. 
Study  treatment must be administered at the dose specified by  GSK.
Subjects approved b y GS K Medical Governance for restarting stud y treatment mu st 
return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries 
have been demonstrated and then laboratory  monitoring may  resume as per protocol.

143If after study  treatment re -start, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistr y 
stopping criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions.
Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as 
required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following stud y treatment 
restart. 
GSK, or designee, to be notified of an y adverse events, as per Section 6.9.

14514.5. Appendix 5: RECIST 1.1
I. Efficacy  Assessment
Disease progression and response evaluations will be determined according to the 
definitions established in the Response Evaluatio n Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST 
1.1) [ Chung , 2010; Eisenhauer , 2009].
See the Time and Events Table sfor the schedule of efficacy  assessments. Assessments 
must be performed on a calendar schedule and should not be affected by  dose 
interruptions/delay s. For post baseline assessments, a window of 14 day s is permitted to 
allow for flexible scheduling.
The following are required at baseline: CT for Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis or MRI  for 
Abdomen/Pelvis and clinical disease assessment for palpable lesions, brain scan and 
bone scan. At each post baseline assessment, evaluations of the sites of disease 
identified by  these scans are required except for brain scan and bone scans. Brain and 
Bone scans should be performed as clinically indicated.
Confirmation of CR and PR are required per protocol. Confirmation assessments must be 
performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response have initially  been met and 
may be performed at the next protocol scheduled assessment. If a confirmation 
assessment is performed prior to the next protocol schedule assessment, the next protocol 
scheduled evaluation is still required (e.g. evaluations must occur at each protocol 
scheduled timepoint regardl ess of unscheduled assessments).
A baseline bone scan is required for all subjects. For subjects without bone disease at 
baseline, subsequent bone scans should onl y be performed as clinicall y indicated (e.g. 
presentation of bone pain). For subjects with bone disease at baseline, a bone scan is 
required as clinicall y indicated. In addition, in order to assign a response of CR in a 
subject with bone disease at baseline, a bone scan must be performed within the 
timeframe of 1 week prior to the first of images showing CR to 4 weeks after the next 
protocol specified assessment.
A baseline brain scan is required for all subjects. For subjects without CNS disease at 
baseline, subsequent brain scans should only  be performed as clinicall y indicated (e.g. 
symptoms suggestive of CNS progression). For subjects with CNS disease at baseline, a 
brain scan is required as clinically  indicated. In addition, in order to confirm a CR in a 
subject with brain disease at baseline, a brain scan must be performed 1 week prior to the 
1st set of images showing CR to 4 weeks after the next protocol specified assessment.
Ia. Baseline documentation o f target and non -target lesions
All baseline lesion assessments must be performed within 28 day s of 
randomizations. 
Lym ph nodes that have a short axis of <10mm are considered non -pathological and 
should not be recorded or followed.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
146Pathological l ymph nodes with <15mm and but  10mm short axis are considered 
non measurable.
Pathological l ymph nodes with  15mm short axis are considered measurable and can 
be selected as target lesions, however l ymph nodes should not be selected as target 
lesions when other suitable target lesions are available. 
Measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all i nvolved organs, should be identified as target lesions, and 
recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability  for accurate 
repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinicall y). 
Note : Cystic lesions thought to represent cy stic metastases should not be selected as 
target lesions when other suitable target lesions are available.
Note : Measurable lesions that have been previously  irradiated and have not been shown 
to be progressing following irradiation should not be considered as target lesions. 
Lytic bone lesions or mixed ly tic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated b y CT or MRI can be considered measu rable.  
Bone scans, FDG -PET scans or X -rays are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesions.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions will be group b y organ. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each 
should be noted throughout follow-up. 
Ib. A ssessment Guidelines
Please note the following:
The same diagnostic method, including use of contrast when ap plicable, must be 
used throughout the study to evaluate a lesion.
All measurements should be taken and recorded in millimeters (mm), using a ruler or 
calipers.
Ultrasound is not a suitable modality  of disease assessment. If new lesions are 
identified by  ultrasound, confirmation by  CT or MRI  is required.
Fluorodeox yglucose (FDG) -PET is generally  not suitable for ongoing assessments of 
disease. However FDG -PET can be useful in confirming new sites of disease where 
a positive FDG -PET scans correlates with the new site of disease present on CT/MRI  
or when a baseline FDG -PET was previousl y negative for the site of the new lesion. 
FDG -PET may  also be used in lieu of a standard bone scan providing coverage 
allows interrogation of all likely  sites of bone disease an d FDG -PET is performed at 
all assessments.
If PET/CT is performed then the CT component can only  be used for standard 
response assessments if performed to diagnostic quality , which includes the required 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
147anatomical coverage and prescribed use of contrast. T he method of assessment 
should be noted as CT on the CRF.
Clinical Examination : Clinically  detected lesions will only  be considered measurable 
when they  are superficial (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by color photography , including a ruler/callipers to measure the size of the lesion, is 
required. [ Chung , 2010; Eisenhauer , 2009]. 
CT and MRI: Contrast enhanced CT with 5mm contiguous slices is recommended.
Minimum size of a measurable baseline lesion should be twice the slice thickness, with a 
minimum lesion size of 10 mm when the slice thickness is 5 mm. MRI  is acceptable, but 
when used, the technical specification of the scanning sequences shoul d be optimised for 
the evaluation of the t ype and site of disease and lesions must be measured in the same 
anatomic plane b y use of the same imaging examinations. Whenever possible the sa me 
scanner should be used. [ Chung , 2010; Eisenhauer , 2009].
X-ray: In general, X -ray should not be used for target lesion measurements owing to 
poor lesion definition. Lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they  are 
clearl y defi ned and surrounded by  aerated lung; however chest CT is preferred over chest 
X-ray [Chung , 2010; Eisenhauer , 2009].
Brain Scan : Baseline brain scans are required, then contras t enhanced MRI is preferable 
to contrast enhanced CT.
Bone Scan (typically bone scintigraphy) : If a bone scan is performed and a new 
lesion(s) is equivocal, then correlative imaging (i.e.X- ray, CT, or MRI) is required to 
demonstrate malignant characteristics of the lesion(s). 
Note: PET [FDG or fluoride] may  be used in lieu of a standard bone scan providing 
coverage allows interrogation of all likely  sites of bone disease and PET is performed at 
all assessments.
Ic. Follow -up A ssessments for Subjects Perman ently  Discontinued from 
Study Treatment
Refer to Section 4.2.4.1 and the Time and Events Tables found in the protocol for follow-
up assessment of subjects who are to be followed up for disease progression and/or
survival after permanently discontinue from study  treatment
Id. A ssessment of Subject Completion
If the last radiographic assessment was more than 8 weeks prior to withdrawal from stud y 
and progressive disease has not been documented, a disease assessment should be 
obtained at the time of withdrawal from stud y.

148II. Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease
IIa. Measurable and Non- measurable Definitions
Measurable lesion:
A non nodal lesion that can be accuratel y measured in at least one dimension (longest 
dime nsion) of
  10 mm with MRI  or CT when the scan slice thickness is no greater than 5mm. I f 
the slice thickness is greater than 5mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion 
must be at least double the slice thickness (e.g., if the slice thickness is 10 mm, a 
measurable lesion must be 20 mm).
  10 mm calliper/ruler measurement by  clinical exam or medical photography . 
  20 mm by  chest x -ray.
Additionally  lymph nodes can be considered pathologicall y enlarged and measurable if
  15mm in the short axis when assesse d by CT or MRI  (slice thickness recommended 
to be no more than 5mm). At baseline and follow -up, only  the short axis will be 
measured [ Chung , 2010; Eisenhauer , 2009].
Non-measu rable lesion:
All other lesions including lesions too small to be considered measurable (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological l ymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm and <15 mm short axis) as 
well as truly  non-measurable lesions, which include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusions, inflammatory  breast disease, l ymphangitic involvement 
of the skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegal y identified by ph ysical 
exam that is not measurable by  reproducible imaging techniques [ Eisenhauer , 2009].
Measurable disease : The presence of at least one measurable lesion. Palpable lesions 
that are not measurable by radiologic or photographic evaluations may  not be utilized as 
the only  measurable lesion.
Non
-Measurable only disease : The presence of only  non- measurable lesions. 
III. Response Criteria
IIIa. Evaluation of target lesions
Definitions for assessment of response for target lesion(s) are as follows:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all targ et lesions. An y pathological 
lymph nodes must be <10mm in the short axis.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum of the diameters (e.g. percent change 
from basel
ine).
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
149Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify  for progressive disease.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as a reference, th e smallest sum of diameters recorded since the 
treatment started (e.g. percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the 
smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must 
have an absolute increase from nadir of 5mm .
Not Applicable (NA): No target lesions at baseline.
Not Evaluable (NE): Cannot be classified b y one of the five preceding definitions.
Note:
If lymph nodes are documented as target lesions the short axis is added into the sum 
of the diameters (e.g. sum o f diameters is the sum of the longest diameters for non-
nodal lesions and the short axis for nodal lesions). When ly mph nodes decrease to 
non-pathological size (short axis <10mm) they  should still have a measurement 
reported in order not to overstate progr
ession.
If at a given assessment time point all target lesions identified at baseline are not 
assessed, sum of the diameters cannot be calculated for purposes of assessing CR, 
PR, or SD, or for use as the nadir for future assessments. However, the sum of t he 
diameters of the assessed lesions and the percent change from nadir should be 
calculated to ensure that progression has not been documented. If an assessment of 
PD cannot be made, the response assessment should be NE.
All lesions (nodal and non -nodal) s hould have their measurements recorded even 
when very  small (e.g 2 mm). If lesions are present but too small to measure, 5 mm 
should be recorded and should contribute to the sum of the diameters, unless it is 
likely  that the lesion has disappeared in which case 0 mm should be reported.
If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time point it should continue to 
be measured. The response at the time when the lesion reappears will depend upon 
the status of the other lesions. For example, if the disea se had reached a CR status 
then PD would be documented at the time of reappearance. However, if the response 
status was PR or SD, the diameter of the reappearing lesion should be added to the 
remaining diameters and response determined based on percent cha nge from baseline 
and percent change from nadir.
IIIb. Evaluation of non -target lesions
Definitions for assessment of response for non-target lesions are as follows:
Complete Response (CR): The disappearance of all non- target lesions. All lymph 
nodes ident ified as a site of disease at baseline must be non- pathological (e.g. <10 
mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: The persistence of 1 or more non -target lesion(s) or ly mph nodes 
identified as a site of disease at baseline ≥ 10 mm short axis.
Progressive Disease (P D): Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
150Not Applicable (NA): No non- target lesions at baseline.
Not Evaluable (NE): Cannot be classified by one of the four preceding definitions.
Note:
In the presence of measurable disease, progression on the basis of solely  non-target 
disease requires substantial worsening such that even in the presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficientl y to merit 
discontinuation of therapy .
Sites of non- target lesions, which are not assessed at a particular timepoint based on 
the assessment schedule, should be excluded from the response determination (e.g. 
non-target response does not have to be "Not Evaluable"). 
IIIc. New lesions
New malignancies denoting disease progres sion must be unequivocal. Lesions identified 
in follow -
up in an anatomical location not scanned at baseline are considered new 
lesions.
Any equivocal new lesions should continue to be followed. Treatment can continue at the 
discretion of the investigator u ntil the next scheduled assessment. If at the next 
assessment the new lesion is considered to be unequivocal, progression should be 
documented.
IIId. Evaluation of overall response
The table below presents the overall response at an individual time point f or all possible 
combinations of tumor responses in target and non -target lesions with or without the 
appearance of new lesions for subjects with measurable disease at baseline.

BET115521
151Note :
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evide nce of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having "s ymptomatic deterioration." Objective response status is 
determined b y evaluations of disease burden. Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after disco ntinuation of treatment. 
In some circumstances, it may  be difficult to distinguish residual disease from 
normal tissue. When the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspira te/biopsy ) to 
confirm the CR.
The dosing schedule, dosing interruptions and design (see Time a nd Events Tables) 
should be considered when assessing tumor response. Thus, subjects with PD before 
the Week 9 visit , but without rapid clinical deterioration, ma y continue planned 
dosing schedule to allow detection of antitumor response. I t is recommended that 
subjects who experience investigator -determined PD at the Week 9 visit , at the 
discretion of the investigator, may  receive additional tumor assessment befor e the 
initiation of alternative anticancer therap y. 
During Part 1 or Part 2, is recommended that subjects who experience investigator -
determined PD at an y time, at the discretion of the investigator, may  receive 
additional tumor assessment before the init iation of alternative anticancer therap y.
IIIe. Evaluation of best overall response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence and will be determined programmatically  by GSK 
based on the investigators assessment of response at each time point. 
To be assigned a status of SD, follow- up disease assessment must have met the SD 
criteria at least once after first dose at a minimum interval of 4 weeks.
If the minimum time for SD is not met, best response will depend on the subsequent 
assessments. For example if an assessment of PD follows the assessment of SD and 
SD does not meet the minimum time requirement the best response will be PD. 
Alternative subjects lost to follow- up after a n SD assessment not meeting the 
minimum time criteria will be considered not evaluable.
IIIf. Confirmation Criteria (recommended):
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory  disease assessment should be 
performed no less than 4 weeks (28 day s) aft er the criteria for response are first met.
IIIg. Independent Review
Disease progression and response evaluations will be collected centrally  during the study  
and may  be reviewed or anal yzed by an independent central reviewer. Details will be 
provided in t he SPM.

15214.6. Appendix 6: Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma
Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Measurable Disease (using CT 
or MRI as per RECIST)
Follow standard RECIST criteria.
Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with MIBG Positive Le sions
MIBG Positive Lesions
Patients who have a positive MIBG scan at the start of therap y will be evaluable for 
MIBG response. The use of 123I for MIBG imaging is recommended for all scans. If the 
patient has only  one MIBG positive lesion and that lesion was radiated, a biopsy  must be 
done at least 28 day s after radiation was completed and must show viable neuroblastoma.
The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response:
Complete response : Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions
Partial Response : Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with persistence 
of other MIBG positive lesions
Stable disease : No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions
Progressive disease : Development of new MIBG positive lesions
The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed o using the Curie scale as outlined below. 
The body  is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary  lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for an y extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan. I n each 
region, the l esions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded as: 
0 = no site per segment, 
1 = 1 site per segment, 
2 = more than one site per segment, 
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment). 
The absolute score is obtained by  adding the score of all the segments. See diagram of 
sectors below:
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
153
The relative score is calculated by  dividing the absolute score at each time point by  the 
corresponding pre -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each patient is 
calculated at each respon se assessment compared to baseline and classified as below:
1.Complete response : all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completel y resolved. If 
morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biops y or aspiration is 
present at enrollment, no tumor cells can b e detected by  routine morphology  on two 
subsequent bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least 21 days apart 
to be considered a Complete Response.
2.Partial response: Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 (lesions 
strongl yreduced).
3.Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly  but significantl y reduced) to 1.0 
(lesions not reduced).
4.Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.
Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement
Bone Marrow Involvement 
Bone marrow obtained within 28 day s prior to study  enrollment with tumor cells seen on 
routine morphology  (not by  immunohistochemical staining only ) of bilateral aspirate or 
biopsy  on one bone marrow sample.
Bone Marrow responses are determined by H&E Staining of bilateral bone marrow 
biopsies and aspirates.
Complete Response : No tumor cells detectable by  routine morphology  on 2 consecutive 
bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed at least 21 day s apart. 
Normalization of urinary ca techolamines or other tumor markers if elevated at study  
enrollment.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
154Progressive Disease : In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone marrow b y 
morphology  have progressive disease if there is a doubling in the amount of tumor in the 
marrow AND a min imum of 25% tumor in bone marrow b y morphology . (For example, a 
patient entering with 5% tumor in marrow b y morphology  must increase to ≥ 25% tumor 
to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 30% tumor must increase to > 60%).
In patients who enro ll without evidence of neuroblastoma in bone marrow will be defined 
as progressive disease if tumor is detected in 2 consecutive bone marrow biopsies or 
aspirations done at least 21 day s apart.
Stable Disease : Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet the criteria for 
either complete response or progressive disease.

15514.7. Appendix 7: NYHA  Functional Classification Sy stem for 
Heart Failure
The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification [ NYHA , 1994]
provides a simple way  of classify ing the extent of heart failure. It places subjects in one 
of four categories based on the level of limitation experienced during ph ysical activity :
Class Symptoms
Class I
(Mild)No limitation of physical activity. Ordina ry physical activity does not cause 
undue fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class II
(Mild)Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical 
activity results in fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea.
Class III
(Moderate)Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than 
ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea.
Class IV
(Severe)Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of 
cardiac insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is 
increased.

AMENDMENT 1
Protocol Amendment 1 applies to all site(s) participating in the conduct of the study
Amendment 1 summary:
Amendment No.1: Amendment 1 applies to all study  sites.  Modifications include 
updated medical monitoring information due to a personnel change on th e GSK team. In 
addition, the following review of the protocol b y the FDA, the following changes are 
made: For Part 1, the starting dose of GSK525762 is reduced from 5 mg/day  to 2 mg/day . 
Cardiac troponin T level assessments are required as a part of the in clusion criteria and 
thereafter.   An observation of CTCAE Grade 2 drug related toxicity , including grade 2 
troponin T elevation, in one subject will end accelerated dose titration in Part 1.  Subjects 
with a history  of gastrointestinal bleeding or active bleeding (positive guaiac fecal occult 
blood monitoring) will be excluded.  In addition, wording for dose escalation decisions 
has been modified to state that no more than a 2 -fold increase in dose will occur between 
successive cohorts.  A staggered dosing approach will be implemented in the 3+3 dosing 
design to minimize potential for toxicity  in multiple subjects. Alternative dosing 
regimens will not be implemented without consultation with FDA and a protocol 
amendment.  For Part 2 of the trial, stopping r ules based on lack of efficacy and the 
futility  rule have been modified. Additionally  the disease assessment scans may  be 
reviewed retrospectivel y by an independent radiologist.  Finall y, multiple Time and 
Event Tables have been revised for consistency  across Part 1 and Part 2 of the protocol.
List of Specific Changes
Rationale Change 1:
The sponsor and medical monitoring information has been updated based on internal 
GSK team personnel changes.

161PREVIOUS TEXT, Section 1.2.2.2 Starting dose 
Based on to lerability , the HNSTD was defined as 1mg/kg in the dog. 1/6 dog HNSTD is 
3.33 mg/m2which translates to a starting dose in man of 5.7 mg, assuming a 70 kg adult 
and adult surface area of 1.7 m2.
REVISED TEXT, Section 1.2.2.2 Starting dose 
Based on tolerability  and QT prolongation tolerability , the HNSTD was defined as 
0.31mg/kg in the dog. 1/6 dog HNSTD is 13.33 mg/m2which translates to a starting dose 
in man of 1.7 5.7 mg (rounded to a starting dose of 2 mg based on tablet strength) , 
assuming a 70 kg adul t and adult surface area of 1.7 m2. 
PREVIOUS TEXT. Section 1.2.2.2 Starting dose 
Taking all four approaches into consideration, a starting dose of 5 mg is proposed. This 
dose will provide a suitable safet y margin to the QTc prolongation observed on repea t 
dosing in the dog (given that a 10 mg clinical dose is equivalent to 6 mg/m2, and has been 
shown to be equivalent to the QTc NOEL in the dog 4 week stud y).
REVISED TEXT, Section 1.2.2.2 Starting dose 
Taking all four approaches into consideration, a star ting dose of 52mg is proposed. This

An accelerated dose titration schema with one subject per dose level will be used i nitially  
to minimize suboptimal drug exposures. Sequential subjects will follow an accelerated

REVISED TEXT, Section 3.2.1.1, Accelerated Dose Titration
An accelerated dose titration schema with one subject per dose level will be used initially  
to minimize suboptimal drug exposures. Sequential su bjects will follow an accelerated 
dose escalation as described in below . Accelerated dose titration will continue until a ≥ 
Grade 2 drug -related adverse event or a DLT is observed in one subject (see Table 3) .
This would end the accelerated dose escalation and would lead to the enrollment of a 
total of 3 subjects initially at this dose level. This may  occur with a doubling of dose until 
one of the subjects experiences a DLT or the second subject experiences a ≥ Grade 2 
drug-related adverse event as determined by  CTCAE v. 4.0 (Table 3). See Alternative 
dosing Section 3.2.1.6. Subsequent subjects will follow a 3+3 dose escalation schema as 
described below (see Table 4). If no more than one DL T is observed in these 3 subjects 
then an additional 3 subjects will be added as described in Table 4 (3+3 Dose Escalation 
Decision Process).  If two or more DLTs are observed at an y dose l evel, the MTD will 
have been exceeded.

A dose escalation schema has been included to d escribe Accelerated Dose escalation 
transition to a traditional 3+3 design.  In addition, a staggered dosing approach will be 
implemented to minimize the risk of exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in multiple 
subjects.  New wording has been added that an y alternative dosing regimens will not be 
implemented without consultation with FDA and a protocol amendment.  Finally , the 
timing of intra -subject dose escalation has been modified to lengthen the time period 
before a subject can dose escalate.

subjects would enter the cohort. Dose escalation decisions as shown in Dose Escalation 
Decision Process
Once a standard 3+3 dose escalation design is implemented the subjects will be entered in 
a staggered approach with at least 3 day s between each subject to minimize the risk of 
inadvertentl y exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in multiple subjects.
As not ed in Table 4, the escalation to the next dose level will not increase greater than 2 
fold from the previous dose level.

Troponin T assessment will be required in the in clusion criteria and for dose limiting 
toxicity  (DLT) determination. At some sites, troponin T is not available and a central 
laboratory  has been established.  Therefore, troponin (I  or T) checked locally  and 
troponin T levels will be anal yzed centrally  toprovide consistent monitoring of troponin 
T across the study.  This will allow the sites a real -time monitoring for cardiac toxicity  
and provide consistent monitoring of troponin T across the study .  In addition, the dose 
limiting toxicity  definition has been clarified to exclude fatigue and mucosis which are 
common non-drug related events associated with disease.

Footnote 1: L PS and PD whole blood timing may  be adjusted based on pharmacokinetic profile observed in the patient cohorts. T he 
timing adjustment may  shift to be closer to Tmax. For example, L PS samples could be 1hr 5 mins, 2hr -10mins and 4 hrs 15 mins. 
The shift in timing would be determined during a dose escalation meeting or safet y review meeting and circulated in the minutes to the 
investigators to address the new timings.

STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION : This study is divided into 2 parts; Part 1 
of the study  is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended dose for Part 2 
based on the safet y, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles observed 
after oral administration of GSK525762. Eligible subjects with NUT midline 
carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, neuroblastomaand any 
other MYCN -amplified solid tumor will be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established.  Subjec ts may  continue 
treatment in the study  until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , 
withdrawal of consent, or commercial suppl y of GSK525762 becomes available 
to the subject. An expansion cohort is planned to further explore clinical activity  
at the MTD in NMC (Part 2). Duration of stud y will depend on recruitment 
rates, and timing of subjects’ duration on study  (withdrawal rates due to toxicity  
or progression).
PHARMACOKINETIC/PHARMACODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS : 
There is serial pharmacokinetic (PK) samplin g for this study . Single safet y PK 
blood draws may  be collected for subjects with severe adverse events or adverse 
events of concern.  Blood samples will be collected for anal ysis of protein 
biomarkers (cy tokines and acute phase proteins) and mRNA. L PS ind uction of 
cytokines in whole blood will be assessed. In addition, pre -treatment and post -
treatment tumor samples will be collected from selected subjects to be evaluated 
for target engagement and effects of GSK525762 on tumor biology .

subjects.  Dose escalation in Part 1B will begin at 25% of the adult MTD 
and dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design.  Pediatric subjects 12 to ≤ 15 
years old may be enro lled in Part 2 once the MTD has been determined in 
Part 1B. An expansion cohort is planned to further explore clinical activity  at

235PHARMACOKINETIC/PHARMACODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS : 
There is extensive serial pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling in Part 1 and limited 
PK sampling in Part 2 for this study . Single safety  PK blood draws may  be 
collected fo r subjects with severe adverse events or adverse events of concern.  
Blood samples will be collected for anal ysis of protein biomarkers (cy tokines 
and acute phase proteins) and mRNA. L PS induction of cy tokines in whole 
blood will be assessed. In addition, pre -treatment and post- treatment tumor 
samples will be collected from selected subjects to be evaluated for target 
engagement and effects of GSK525762 on tumor biology .
Rationale for Change:
The study  design was updated with the addition of the NMC PD Expa nsion Cohort to 
evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of GSK525762 at doses that have been cleared 
during 3+3 dose escalation during Part 1A.  The study  design was also clarified in this 
section to reference the pediatric cohort in Part1B.  The duration of exposure on the study  
was updated in accordance with the Commission Directive 2005/28/EC such that 
availability  of commercial drug suppl y was not included in duration of treatment on 
study .  The collection of PK during Part 1 and Part were clarified.

Reproductive: In 4-week toxicology  studies, bilateral sperm retention, germ cell 
degeneration and tubular vacuolization, and depletion of testicular germinal epithelium 
occurred in male dogs receiving ≥ 0.3 mg/kg and male rats receiving ≥ 10mg/kg doses of 
GSK525762.  Exposures associated with reproductive toxicity  in male dogs overlap with 
the proposed 5 mg starting dose in this FTIH study .In the BET11521 study, specific 
contraceptive guidelines and precautions f or males and females are provided in the 
protocol.  In addition, subjects will be informed of potential reproductive risks and 
precautions in the informed consent.
Potential drug- drug interactions based on nonclinical studies: There is low potential 
for G SK525762 to induce or inhibit cy tochrome P450 (CYP) enzy mes or to inhibit Pgp 
or BCRP.  Use of concurrent drugs with potential to prolonged QTcF will be used with 
extreme caution or prohibited (as outlined in Section 7.1 of the protocol).  Regarding 
drugs for hyperemesis, p alonosetron and ondansetron at a maximum dose of 8 mg TID 
will be the only  allowed serotonin 5- HT3 receptor antagonist drugs.

3.1Study Design/Schematic
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Therefore, adherence to the study  design 
requirements, including those specified in the Time and Events Tables, are essential.
This is an open -label, single and repeat dose, 2- part stud y to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given 
once -daily orally. (Part 1A ) will be conducted in adult subjects with NMC, small cell 
lung cancer (SCL C), colorectal cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB ), MYCN  driven solid 
tumors [including non -small cell lung cancer (NSCL C) with MYCN amplification].   
Once the MTD is determined in adult subjects, a pediatric cohort of subjects 12 to ≤15 
years of age with solid tumors will be opened (Part 1B) to evaluate MTD in this age 
group. An expansion cohort (Part 2) is planned to further explore clinical activity of 
GSK525762 in subjects with NMC as shown in Figure 1. The expansion cohort will 
enroll both adult (16 y ears old and above) and pediatric (12 to 
≤15 y ears) subjects at their 
appropriate R2PD doses.

237In Part 1A, an accelerated dose titration will be employ ed with one subject per dose level 
until the first instance of a Grade 2 drug related toxicity  occurs. Thereafter, subjects will 
be enrolled in a standard 3+3 design. 
After the MTD has been determined in Part 1A, Part 1B and Part 2 will be opened. Dose 
titration in the pediatric subjects in Part 1B will start at 25% of the MTD determined in 
Part 1A and will follow a standard 3+3 design. Pediatric subjects will be entered to Part 2 
upon completion of Part 1B.
In both Parts 1 and 2, all subjects will be eval uated for s ystemic and ex -vivo on- target 
BET inhibitory  effects in blood. I n addition, pre -treatment and post- treatment tumor 
samples will be collected from selected subjects to be evaluated for target engagement 
and effects of GSK525762 on tumor biology .

During the dose escalation of Part 1A, additional subjects with NMC will be 
enrolled in a Pharmacodynamic (PD) Expansion Cohort to evaluate the 
pharmacodynamic effects of GSK525762 at lower doses that have been previously 
cleared during dose escalation. This will enable collection of pharmacodynamic 
data across the predicted efficacious dose range and contribute to the evaluation of 
a biologically efficacious dose. Once the MTD RP2D is determined in adult subjects, a
Part 1B will be opened to enroll pediatric cohort of subjects 12 to ≤15 y ears of age with 
solid tumors will be opened (Part 1B) to determine the MTD RP2D in this age group. 
Dose escalation in Part 1B will begin at 25% of the adult MTD and dose escalation 
will follow a 3+3 design.   An expansion cohort (Part 2) is planned to further explore 
clinical activity  of GSK525762 in subjects with NMC as shown in Figure 1. The

Part 1B will be initiated after the MTD is reached in Part 1A and will start at 25% of the 
MTD determined in Part 1A. Part 1B will follow a standard 3+3 design.
In the accelerated dose escalation cohorts and the 3+3 dose escalation cohorts, the 
dose will be escalated based on all available data, including PK data and the safety 
profile of prior cohorts, as well as the predicted dose from the Neuenschwander-
Continuous Reassessment Method (N -CRM) design 
[Neuenschwander Neuenschwander , 2009].  N -CRM design is a type of Bayesian 
adaptive dose escalation scheme.  The method is fully adaptive and makes use of all 
theDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) information available at the time of each dose 
assignment.  The DLT information of all subjects enrolled in the trial are used to 
update the dose -toxicity relationship and provide supportive information in addition 
to 3+3 desi gn in the next escalation/de- escalation decision.
Rationale for Change:
Dose escalation follows the 3+3 design and the protocol was updated to clarify  that dose 
escalation decisions includes evaluation of all safety data from prior dose cohorts, PK/PD 
data, and supportive information that results from the CRM.

3.2.2.6 Intra -Subject Dose Escalation
Intra -subject dose escalations may  be considered on a case -by-case basis, provided that 
the subject has not experienced an y Grade 2 or higher drug related toxicity during the 
first4 weeks of investigational therap y in the accelerated dose escalation phase or a DLT 
in the 3+3 dose escalation phase and contingent upon one of the following:
If additional subject(s) have been enrolled at a higher dose in the dose escalation 
phase and a t least one subject has completed 4 weeks of dosing on that regimen 
without a DL T, and after review of all safet y data and approval b y a GSK Medical 
Monitor, a subject on a lower dose level may  be increased up to the highest dose 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
241level tested.  In this cas e the subject may  begin daily  dosing at the higher dose level 
as it will have alread y been demonstrated to be tolerable.
If no further subjects have been identified for a subsequent higher dose level and 
after a subject has completed 4 weeks of dosing on t hat regimen without a DL T, that 
subject may  be escalated to the next higher dose level after an additional 4 weeks of 
dosing (total of 8 weeks of dosing), review of all safet y data and approval by  a GSK 
Medical Monitor. In this case the subject must follow the staggered dosing schedule 
outlined in Table 2, as he/she will be the first subject exposed to the higher dose. 
Additional safet y assessments such as insulin/glucose or cardiac monitoring may be 
specified at the time of dose escalation or schedule mod ification based on the safet y 
profile in previous subjects at the higher dose level. I ntra-subject dose escalations or 
schedule modification will be discussed with investigators and approved b y the GSK 
Medical Monitor and safety  monitoring required will be specified in writing.

Intra -subject dose escalations may  be considered on a case -by-case basis, provided that 
the subject has not experienced an y Grade 2 or higher drug related toxicity during the 
first4 weeks of investigational therap y in the accelerated dose escalation phase or a DLT 
in the 3+3 dose escalation phase and contingent upon one of the following:
If additional subject(s) have been enrolled at a higher dose in the dose escalation 
phase and a t least one subject has completed 4 weeks of dosing on that regimen 
without a DL T, and after review of all safet y data and approval b y a GSK Medical 
Monitor, a subject on a lower dose level may  be increased up to the highest dose 
level tested.  In this cas e the subject may  begin daily  dosing at the higher dose level 
as it will have alread y been demonstrated to be tolerable.
If no further subjects have been identified for a subsequent higher dose level and 
after a subject has completed 4 weeks of dosing on t hat regimen without a DL T, that 
subject may  be escalated to the next higher dose level after an additional 4 weeks of 
dosing (total of 8 weeks of dosing), review of all safet y data and approval by  a GSK 
Medical Monitor. In this case the subject must follow the staggered dosing schedule 
outlined in Table 
2, as he/she will be the first subject exposed to the higher dose. 
Subjects approved for intra -subject dose escalation will require additional limited 
PK sampling at the higher dose (pre -dose, 0.5, 3 and 6 -8 hours), as determined by 
GSK Clinical Pharmacology.   Additional safety  assessments such as insulin/glucose or 
cardiac monitoring may  be specified at the time of dose escalation or schedule 
modification based on the safety profile in previous subjects at the higher dose level. 
Intra -subject dose escalations or schedule modification will be discussed with 
investigators and approved by  the GSK Medical Monitor and safet y monitoring required 
will be specified in writing.
Rationale for Change:

242Subjects who are approved for intra -subject dose escalation will require PK sampling at 
the higher approved dose in order to evaluate PK parameters at the higher dose level.

3.2.5 Part 1 NMC Pharmacodynamic Expansion Cohort
In the event there are no avail able enrollment slots during 3+3 dose escalation, 
eligible subjects with NMC (Section 6.2) may be enrolled in a Pharmacodynamic 
(PD) Expansion Cohort to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of GSK525762 at doses 
that have previously been cleared during 3+3 dose e scalation.  Three subjects with 
NMC will be allowed to enroll at the last cleared dose level only if subjects with 
NMC or other solid tumor types (Section 4.2.1 Inclusion Criteria) have already 
enrolled in 3+3 dose escalation. Enrollment in the PD Expansion Cohort will 
continue until either 12 subjects with NMC are enrolled in the PD Expansion 
Cohort, or until the RP2D is determined in Part 1A, whichever occurs first.  
Eligibility criteria for subjects diagnosed with NMC to enroll in this cohort are 
describ ed in Section 4.2 (Part 1A).   Biopsy collection will be mandatory as 
described in Section 3.2.2.4, unless a waiver is granted by the GSK medical monitor.  
18FDG -PET will be required for all subjects in this cohort.
Subjects in the PD Dose Expansion Cohort will start with same staggered dosing 
during the first two weeks as described in Section 3.2.2 (Table 2); subjects will begin 
continuous dosing in Week 3.  Extensive monitoring for cardiac safety signals will 
be performed as required in Part 1A, with trip licate 12- lead ECGs, 48 -hour 
telemetry, and 24 -hour Holter monitoring to be performed on the days indicated in 
Table 2.  All safety and PK evaluations will be performed as outlined in the Time 
and Events Tables for Part 1A (Section 5).  Safety data from su bjects in the NMC 
PD Expansion Cohort will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the GSK medical 
monitor, GSK Safety Review Team, and investigators for consideration during 3+3 
dose escalation decisions.  
Subjects will be eligible for intra- subject dose escalation to a higher approved dose 
as described in Section 3.2.2.6, upon completion of the 4 week observation period, 
tumor biopsy collection, and approval by the investigator and GSK medical monitor 
in consultation with the GSK study team.  Subjects approve d for intra- subject dose 
escalation will require additional limited PK sampling ( pre-dose, 0.5, 3 and 6 -8 
hours) at the higher dose, as determined by GSK Clinical Pharmacology. Subjects 
may continue on daily administration of GSK525762 until permanent 
discontinuation or completion of the study as described in Section 4.2.3.

243Rationale for additional text:
The study  design was updated with the addition of the NMC PD Expansion Cohort to 
evaluate the pharmacod ynamics of GSK525762 at doses that have been cleare d during 
3+3 dose escalation during Part 1A.

Rationale for Change:
Flexibility  was added to allow for the collection of blood samples for PK analy sis at the earlier time points indicated.  Ur ine samples are 
not required from the NMC PD Expansion Cohort for quantitative metabolite analy sis of GSK525762 since samples will be collect ed in

Protocol Amendment 4 applies to all site(s) participating in the conduct of the study
Amendment 04 summary: Amendment 04 includes the addition of subjects with the 
following solid tumor types: castration -resistant prostate ca ncer (CRPC), triple negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (ER positive), and non -
small cell lung cancer (NSCL C). Multiple m yeloma (MM), a haematological malignancy 
previously  included in the trial, is now removed from this trial as it is included in a 
separate trial open for hematologic malignancies with dose escalation to better define the 
benefit/risk balance. Additional details of twice daily  (BID) dosing during dose escalation 
have been included. A Besy late Sub -Study  hasbeen added to determine the relative 
bioavailability  (BA), food effect, and dose proportionality  of the bes ylate formulation of 
GSK525762 at or near the MTD. An update to inclusion criteria has been made to allow 
subjects with evaluable disease to be enro lled in the NMC PD cohort. An updated 
imaging schedule for NMC subjects has been included.

Study Design And Duration
Rationale for Change : The study  design was updated to include“recommended phase 2 
dose (RP2D)” in addition to recommended dose for Part 2” to better summarize the long -
term goal of determining the MTD which will aim t o expand bey ond Part 2 of the trial. 
The study  design was also updated to include the additional tumor ty pes allowed with this 
amendment and multiple my eloma subjects were removed. The rationale for including 
additional solid tumors is included as part of the overall Study  Population Rationale 
(Section 1.2). Multiple my eloma subjects will now be excluded from further enrolment in 
this solid tumor trial, as there is now a separate phase 1 dose escalation trial open in for 
hematologic malignancies to better define the benefit/risk balance. It has been difficult to 
enrol MM patients to this trial (1 out of 18 subjects over 2 y ears) and the higher doses 
alread y reached with solid tumors pose additional risk to MM patients.
Revised Text:
This study  is divided in to 2 parts: 
Part 1A of the stud y is a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and select the arecommended dose for Part 2 or a 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on the safet y, pharmacokinetic, 
and pharmacod ynamic profiles observed after oral administration of 
GSK525762. Eligible subjects with NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) , small 
cell lung cancer (SCL C), non -small cell lung cancer (NSCL C), colorectal 
cancer (CRC) , neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC) , triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive 
(ER positive) breast cancer, multiple my eloma and any  other MYCN -
amplified solid tumor will be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until a maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) is established.  Subjects with NMC will also be 
enrolled in a pharmacod ynamic dose expansion cohort during Part 1A.

BET115521
272Subjects may  continue treatment in the study  until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal of consent. Once the MTD is 
determined in adult subjects ,  
Part 1A  bes ylate sub- study   will explore the relative bioavailability , food 
effect and dose proportionality  of bes ylate formulation. The sub- study  will be 
conducted in subjects eligible for Part 1A at the MTD or a dose near the 
MTD or RP2D. This will be an open- label, randomized, single dose, four 
period, cross over sub- study  to investigate the relative bioavailability  of the 
besylate tablet compared to the amorphous free -base tablet, the effect of 
high-fat high -calorie meal on the bioavailability  of the besylate tablet and the 
dose proportionality  of two doses of GSK525762 administered as bes ylate 
tablets.
Part 1B will be opened to enroll pediatric subjects 12 to ≤15 y ears of age with 
solid tumors to determine the MTD in pediatric subjects.  Dose escalation in 
Part 1B will begin at 25% of the adult MTD and dose escalation will follow a 
3+3 design.  Pediatric subjects 12 to ≤ 15 years old may  be enrolled in Part 2 
once the MTD has been determined in Part 1B. An
Part 2 is an expansion cohort is planned to further explore clinical activity  at 
the MTD in NMC (Part 2) subjects .   
Duration of stud y will depend on recruitment rates, and timing of subjects’ 
duration on study  (withdrawal rates due to toxicity  or progression).

274more sensitive in a subset of SCL C cell lines, with 46% (18 of 39) of cell lines possessing 
a gIC50< 1 µM . It was confirmed in sever al of the cell lines that apoptosis (assessed b y 
caspase cleavage) is induced at concentrations above the gIC 100.  In the 14 most sensitive 
cell lines, the median gIC 50= 0.53 µM and the median gIC 100= 2.2 µM. For comparison, 
GSK525762 has been tested in two cultured lines from NUT -midline carcinoma with an 
average gIC 50= 0.12 µM and average gI C100= 0.32 µM Additionally , significant tumor 
growth inhibition was observed in a subset of cell line and patient -derived subcutaneous 
xenograft models of SCLC . 
No correlation between status of c -Myc or L -Myc and sensitivity  was found. N -Myc 
amplified celllines were found to be sensitive, though the low number (N=2) of lines 
tested with this amplification does not allow for a firm conclusion to be drawn. Although 
no predictive marker of GSK525762 sensitivity  in SCL C has been identified and 
considering the high percentage of cell lines that are sensitive, we would enroll all 
relapsed refractory  SCLC patients in the dose escalation part of the study  while collecting 
data retrospectivel y on potential predictive biomarkers from the available tissues.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
GSK525762 inhibited cell growth in a high percentage of NSCL C cell lines, with 73% 
(19/26) of cell lines tested exhibiting a gIC 50 <1µM. Median g IC50 across the NSCL C cell 
line panel was 0.61 µM. MYCN amplified cell lines were among the most sensitive 
NSCL C cell lines to GSK525762, with a median gIC 50 of 0.17µM and gIC 100 of 3.6µM 
(n=4). A subset of NSCLC cell lines, including the MYCN -amplified li nes, exhibited a 
cytotoxic response to GSK525762. Given the broad sensitivity  of NSCL C cell lines to 
GSK525762, a selection marker will not be used for entry  into the dose escalation part of 
the study .
Colorectal Cancer 
In colorectal cell lines, initial d ata using the same criterion of sensitivity indicates that 
GSK525762 is cy totoxic inhibits growth in a high percentage of lines tested ( 54%, 
7/1358%, 25/43 with gIC 100< 10 µM). I n the 7 sensitive cell lines, the median gIC 50= 
0.18 µM and the median gIC 100=2.2 µM. Also, GSK525762 was found to be sensitive in 
KRAS -mutant colorectal lines, as 5/7 sensitive lines possess this mutation < 1µM). No 
markers of sensitivity  in these lines has been identified y et and, as with SCLC, we 
recommend dosing of all rel apsed refractory  CRC without a selection marker in an initial 
clinical trial.
Neuroblastoma
AllNB cell lines are sensitive to GSK525762, with 83% of cell lines tested to date (n = 
6) were found to be sensitive to GSK525762, with an average (15/18) exhibit ing a gIC 50
= 0.43 µM (n=6) and average gIC 100= 2.3 µM (n=4). The agent is sensitive in MYCN -
amplified lines, as 3 of the 4 lines < 1µM. Median gIC 50 across the NB cell line panel was 
0.48 µM, with a subset of cell lines exhibiting a cytotoxic response to GSK525762. The 
agent is sensitive in MYCN amplified cell lines, as 10 of the 15 sensitive cell lines possess 
the cop y number increase. As with MM, CRC, and SCLC, subjects with NB may  be 
eligible without regard to N -myc status .

275N-Myc amplified solid tumors
N-Myc driven solid tumors from different sources have shown to be sensitive to 
GSK525762. GSK525762 was tested in a panel of NSCL C lines , and N -Myc 
amplification was found to be CRC , a selection marker of sensitivity .  One hundred 
percent (5/5) of N -Myc amplified lines were highly  sensitive while onl y 8.3% (1/12) of 
non N -Myc amplified lines were highl y sensitive.  GSK525762 possesses a median 
gIC50 = 0.37 µM (n=5), gIC100 = 4.7 µM (n=4), in N -Myc amplified cell lines will not 
be used in NB patients for en try into the dose escalation part of the study .
Castration -Resistant Prostate Cancer
A subset of protate cancer cell lines were found to be sensitive to GSK525762, with 57% 
(4/7) of cell lines exhibiting a gIC 50 <1µM. Apoptosis was observed in a subset of 
prostate cancer cell lines as measured b y poly ADP ribose poly merase (PARP) cleavage 
and accumulation of cells in sub- G1 phase of cell cy cle. Prostate cancer lines cell lines, 
including models of CRPC, with high androgen receptor (AR) and high c -Myc protei n 
expression were found to be the most sensitive (lowest gI C50) to GSK525762A. 
Consistent with in vitro observations, significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in 
a subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft model of CRPC expressing high levels of AR 
and MYC. In contrast, no significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in a 
second model expressing low levels of AR and MYC. Given the limited availability  of 
pre-clinical prostate models and the broad sensitivity  of prostate cancer cell lines to 
GSK5 25762, we recommend that no selection marker be used for entry  into the dose 
escalation part of the study .
Triple Negative and ER -positive Breast Cancer
A subset of breast cancer cell lines representing the ER -positive and triple negative sub -
types were found to be sensitive to GSK525762, with 55% (17/31) cell lines tested 
exhibiting a gIC 50< 1µM. Median gIC 50 across the breast cancer cell line panel was 
980nM, with a subset of cell lines exhibiting a cy totoxic response to GSK525762. 
The activity  observed with GSK525762 in ER+ breast cancer cell lines is consistent with 
data reported in two recent publications using the tool BET inhibitor JQ1 [Feng Q, 2014; 
Nagarajan, 2014]. Given the broad activity  of BET inhibitors across the ER+ and triple 
negative subt ypes, we recommend that no selection marker be used for entry into the 
dose escalation part of the study  for ER -positive and TNBC patients.
N-Myc amplified solid tumors
A large majorit y of N -Myc amplified cell lines from various tumor ty pes, including 
SCLC, NSCL C, and neuroblastoma, are highl y sensitive to GSK525762. Across the three 
tumor ty pes, 16 of 19 (84%) MYCN -amplified cell lines possess a gIC 50< 1µM, and 11 of 
19 (58%) exhibit a cy totoxic response to GSK525762. Expression of MYCN was 
suppressed b y GSK525762 in SCL C and NB cell lines, which is consistent with 
published reports [Puissant 2013; Wy ce 2013].

276Given the high percentage of responsive cell lines in multiple my eloma, small cell lung 
cancer, non- small cell lung cancer , colorectal , castration -resistant prostate cancer, triple-
negative breast cancer, ER -positive breast cancer , and neuroblastoma it is appropriate to 
include refractory  patients who have failed prior treatments regimens into the dose 
escalation phase of this study  where this medicine may  prolong survival. In addition 
subjects with any  solid tumor that demonstrates N -myc amplification (e.g., NSCL
C with 
N-Myc amplification )will be eligible for the dose escalation phase of the study .
Section 1.3 Dose Rationale
Rationale for Change : Upd ated with clinical pharmaocokinetic data from subjects

1.3.1 Human Pharmacokinetic extrapolation Pharmacokinetics
Whole blood human clearance was predicted from three species (mouse, rat and dog) 
using simple power -law allometry  (in the absence of detectable in vitro metabolism) to be 
2.8 ml/min/kg. Volume of distribution was predicted from Gastroplus to be 2.6 L /kg and 
half-life 10 hours (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2010N108204_00 , 2011). As the 
in vitro blood to plasma ration was 0.86, a 70 kg adult ther efore has predicted total 
clearance of 10.1 L/hr and a total plasma volume of distribution of 157 L . Bioavailability  
is predicted to be high given GSK525762 is a Bio -pharmaceutics Classification Sy stem 
(BCS) Class 1 molecule, and assumed to fall in the ran ge 50 -100%.
As of 23 -July-2014, the pharmacokinetics of GSK525762 has been evaluated in 19 
subjects following single and repeated dail y administration of 2 mg to 60 mg of 
GSK525762. The summary  statistics of the preliminary  PK parameters are summarized in 
Table 1 and Table 2 after single and repeat dail y oral administration, respectively . 
GSK525762 pharmacokinetics are characterized by a rapid absorption with maximum 
concentration occurring mostly  within the first hour after dosing. GSK525762 is 
eliminated rapidly  with an average terminal phase half -life of 3 to 7 hours, leading to a 
lack of accumulation following once daily oral administration. Following single oral 
administration and repeated once daily  administration of 2 mg to 60 mg of GSK525762, 
Cmaxand AUC tended to increase in a dose proportional fashion.

1.3.5. BID Dose Cohort 
1.3.5.1.  Preclinical Rationale
Pre-clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynam ic data suggests a potential benefit of a 
BID dosing regimen compared to QD dosing. In mice, GSK525762 has a short half -life 
of about 1.5 hours. Single dose pharmacod ynamic experiments were performed in three 
SCLC and one CRC mouse xenograft model. Dose -dependent changes in gene expression 
were observed in all models at earl y time points post -dose; however, expression returned 
to pre -treatment levels within 8 -12 hours. Additionally , in a subcutaneous multiple 
myeloma cell line xenograft study , c-Myc protein levels were significantl y reduced 2 and 
5 hours post -dose, and returned to baseline b y 8 hours.The transient effects on gene 
expression observed in these studies with QD dosing highlights the potent ial benefit of 
BID dosing b y extending the duration of gene silencing within a 24 hour period.
QD and BID dosing have been further explored in efficacy  studies in the above -
mentioned SCL C and CRC xenograft models. In a subcutaneous, patient- derived model 
of SCL C, BID dosing at 12.5mg/kg resulted in improved tumor growth inhibition 
compared to 25 mg/kg QD (74% versus 60%, respectivel y).  Improved efficacy with BID 
dosing was also observed in the cell line xenograft model of CRC. BID dosing at 
12.5mg/kg resul ted in 48% tumor growth inhibition, whereas 25mg/kg QD dosing 
resulted in 34% inhibition.  I n a third model, a cell line xenograft of SCL C, there was no 
significant difference in tumor growth inhibition resulting from 12.5mg/kg BID versus 
25mg/kg QD dosing . Thus, we observed equivalent or improved efficacy  with BID 
dosing in all xenograft models tested.
1.3.5.2.  Clinical Rationale
Based on the pharmacokinetics of GSK525762 observed to date, with  the short half -life 
of about 5 hours, it is predicted that even 100 mg QD doses would result in the trough 
concentrations falling below the average in vitro IC50 (0.08 uM to 1.3 uM) for the tumor 
types selected for this study . Dividing the dail y dose into two doses administered about 
12 hours apart would maintain t he concentrations above the lower in vitro IC50 for doses 
around 30 mg BID.  
1.3.6. Doses for Besylate Bioavailability/Food Effect/Dose Proportionality Sub -
Study
A dose at or near the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended Phase 2 dose will be 
used to evaluate the relative bioavailability  of the besy late salt tablet compared to the 
amorphous free -base tablet, as this dose would be the dose level used in Part 2. 
As GSK525762 is a compound with high solubility but low permeability , it is expected 
that a dministration with food will have no effect or possibly a negative effect on its 
absorption [Gu, 2007] Pharm Res 2007, and a dose at or near the MTD or RP2D will be 
used to evaluate the effect of food on the relative BA of GSK525762 administered as the 
besylate salt tablet.  
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
279In addition, to evaluate the dose proportionalit y of the PK of GSK525762 after fasted 
administration as besy late salt tablet, a lower dose of half to one -third of the MTD or 
RP2D will be evaluated.
Section 1.4 Rationale for Study  and E ndpoints
Rationale for Change : Updated this section to include additional solid tumors and the 
besylate sub -study  and to removemultiple my eloma.
Study  schema was replaced to provide additional clarification and to include the Bes ylate 
sub-study . A separate schema was included to illustrate the bes ylate sub -study .
Revised Text:
Safety  and efficacy  (RR) are being assessed to address the primary  objectives of the 
study . The safet y assessments along with the PK will be important for determining the 
MTD of once daily  and/or twice dail y dosing . The pharmacod ynamic assessments will 
further support the recommended Phase II doses (RP2D) and expand the understanding 
regarding mechanism of action. The response rate hurdle of 20% in NMC was 
determined based on 3 parame ters: NMC is a rare population, there is currently  no 
standard of care therap y for NMC, and NMC carries a poor prognosis (median survival of 
9.56.7months [French, 2010] [Bauer, 2012] ).
Given the poor prognosis and high unmet medical need of NMC, as well a s in other 
tumor ty pes such as relapsed/refractory  SCL C, NSCL C,CRC, MM, NB CRPC, TN and 
ER+ BC, NB and N-Myc amplified tumors and the exceptional drug- to-target alignment 
of GSK525762, a combined Phase I/II stud y (BET115521) is proposed. The BET115521 
study comprises an accelerated dose titration (Part 1), which will include subjects with 
NMC and other tumor types that are predicted to be responsive to GSK525762, to 
determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The besy late sub -study  will be an open -
label, randomized, single dose, four period, crossover sub- study  to investigate the relative 
bioavailability  of the besy late salt tablet compared to the amorphous free -base tablet at a 
dose at or near the MTD or RP2D, the effect of high -fat high- calorie meal on the 
bioavailability  of the besylate salt tablet at or near the MTD or RP2D and the dose 
proportionality  of two doses of GSK525762 administered as bes ylate salt tablets. Results 
of the bes ylate sub- study  will enable the use of the besy late salt tablet formulatio n later in 
this study  and provide recommendation around the need for fasting status when 
administering GSK525762.
The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of GSK525762 with possible adjustment based 
on the relative bioavailability  of the bes ylate salt formulat ion, will be studied in the 
cohort expansion (Part 2) to determine efficacy , safety  and tolerability  in NMC patients.

280Section 1.5. Risk A ssessment
Rationale for Change : Minor updates for clarification are included in this section. The 
risk assessment was a lso updated to include reproductive risks based on emerging 
preclinical data. 
Revised Text:
Paragraph 1 :
However, toxicology Toxicology studies performed in dogs, rats and mice suggest that the 
primary  toxicities of GSK525762 are gastrointestinal, cardiova scular, pancreatic, 
hematologic and reproductive (see Clinical Investigational Brochure, Section 3.4).
Paragraph  7 ( Telemetry ):
Continuous telemetric in -patient monitoring for potential adverse arrh ythmias will be 
performed for at least 48 hours from the startadministration of each the first dose.
Paragraph  8 Heading :
Holter Monitoring and Serum Markers
Paragraph  11 ( Cytokines ):
In vitro incubation of human whole blood for 24 hours with GSK525762 resulted in a 
time and concentration -dependent inductio n of IL -1β.The maximum effect was variable 
between donors (34 to 3986 pg/mL, mean 1238 pg/mL  from 16 donors); however, the 
concentration required to drive this effect was consistent across the donors (pEC 506.0, 
0.42ug/mL). This effect was not observed in whole blood from other species (rat and 
dog) or in preparations of human PBMCs or neutrophils.  A human Cmax of 0.42 ug/mL 
would only  be anticipated above the preclinical MTD (human doses 75 -100mg).  Parit y 
at Cmax for the EC20 from the most sensitive donor in these studies (pEC20 6.16, 0.29 
ug/mL) is predicted to correspond to ~50 mg of a dose in humans. Special note is made 
for the occurrence of fever which could be s ymptomatic of cy tokine level elevation 
during dosing of the compound (see protocol Se ction 7.7,  Table 28 “Fever”), and close 
monitoring of cy tokine levels will be instigated at this point.

Section 3.1. Study Design/Schematic
Rationale for Change : Updated this section to include additional solid tumors and the 
besylate sub -study  and to removemultiple my eloma.
Revised Text:
Paragraph 2:
This is an open -label, single and repeat dose, 2 -part study  to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given 
once -daily orally. Twice daily  dosing may  also be explored upon evaluation of safet y, 
PK, and PD data from once -daily dosing . (Part 1A) will be conducted in adult subjects 
with NMC, multiple my eloma (MM), small cell lung cancer (SCL C), non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive 
(ER positive) breast cancer, and MYCN  driven solid tumors [including non -small cell 
lung cancer (NSCL C) with MYCN amplification] .  During the dose escalation of Part 
1A, additional subjects with NMC will be enrolled i n a Pharmacod ynamic (PD) 
Expansion Cohort to evaluate the pharmacod ynam ic effects of GSK525762 at lower 
doses that have been previously  cleared during dose escalation.  This will enable 
collection of pharmacodynamic data across the predicted efficacious do se range and 
contribute to the evaluation of a biologically  efficacious dose.  Once the RP2D is 
determined in adult subjects, Part 1B will be opened to enroll pediatric subjects 12 to ≤15 
years of age with solid tumors to determine the RP2D in this age gro up. Once the RP2D 
is determined in Part 1A, a bes ylate sub-study  will be opened to approximately  10 
subjects to investigate the relative bioavailability  of the bes ylate tablet compared to the 
amorphous free -base tablet at the MTD or RP2D, the effect of hig h-fat high -calorie meal 
on the bioavailability  of the bes ylate tablet at the MTD or RP2D and the dose 
proportionality  of two doses of GSK525762 administered as bes ylate tablet. This sub -

283study  will also use a stable isotope of GSK525762 in order to reduce t he variability  in the 
measurement of drug exposure caused b y day-to-day biologic variations. After Part 1A is 
complete and the relative BA of the formulation for Part 2 is confirmed, an Dose 
escalation in Part 1B will begin at 25% of the adult MTD and dose escalation will follow 
a 3+3 design.  An expansion cohort (Part 2) is planned to further explore clinical activity  
of GSK525762 in subjects with NMC as shown in Figure 1. The expansion cohort will 
enroll both adult (16 y ears old and above) and pediatric ( 12 to ≤15 y ears) subjects at their 
appropriate R2PD doses. After the MTD is determined in adult subjects, Part 1B is 
planned for enrollment of pediatric subjects 12 to ≤15 y ears of age with solid tumors to 
determine the RP2D in this age group. Dose escalat ion in Part 1B will begin at 25% of 
the adult MTD and dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design.
Paragraph 4:
After the MTD has been determined in Part 1A, and the bes ylate sub- study has 
completed, Part 1B and Part 2 will be opened. Dose titration in the pe diatric subjects in 
Part 1B will start at 25% of the MTD determined in Part 1A and will follow a standard 
3+3 design. Pediatric subjects 12 to 15 y ears of age will be entered allowed to enroll in
Part 2 upon completion of once the MTD has been determined in Part 1B.

BID dosing , may  also be explored. This approach will be considered if explored, based on 
the safet y and PK data suggest that a sufficient therapeutic exposure cannot be achieved 
using the initial schedule. If a shorter recovery  period is used, the short half life.  The 
initial dose level will be 50% of the highest completed dose level (at or below MTD) 
with the initial schedule for BID will be 20mg BID or “x”mg BID (where 2x is equivalent 
to the last once dail y dose cleared for dose escalation in P art 1A) –whichever is lower. 
Dosing will be separated by  approximately  12 hours (± 1 hr). Escalation can then proceed 
as described using the 3 + 3 dose escalation. Alternative schedules with intense 
supportive care Additional blood samples will be collecte d for PK, PD, and safet y as 
described in Table 11.
Subjects may  need to undergo dose modification(s) to manage toxicities.  A dose 
adjustment (e.g., BID dose level with a minimum 25% reduction in total daily  dosing or 
QD at the same or lower dose level) may alsobe explored after consultation with GSK 
Medical Monitor. The investigator should use clinical judgment to determine whether the 
dosing scheduling may  be contributing to an y potential toxicity  necessitating dose 
adjustment, and make the appropriate c hange after consultation with the GSK Medical 
Monitor .

Added Text:
3.2.6. Bioavailability, Food Effect, and Dose Proportionality Besylate Sub -Study
Part 1A will include a besy late sub -study that will be an open- label, randomized, single 
dose, four period, cross over study to investigate the relative bioavailability of the 
besylate salt tablet compared to the amorphous free -base tablet at or near the MTD or 
RP2D, the effect of high -fat hig h-calorie meal on the bioavailability  of the besy late salt 
tablet at or near the MTD or RP2D and the dose proportionality  of two doses of 
GSK525762 administered as bes ylate salt tablets. GSK525762 dosing will be separated 
by at least 48 hours.  Up to 12 su bjects may  be enrolled in besy late sub -study . A subject 
requiring dose reduction or discontinuation from study  before completion of the Bes ylate 
Sub-Study  will be replaced by  a new enrollment. All subjects enrolled to the Bes ylate 
Sub-Study , on completion of their participation in this segment of the study , will continue 
on a daily  dosing schedule till disease progression or discontinuation due to 
investigational agent related toxicity  or withdrawal of informed consent.
The high -fat (approximately  50% of th e total caloric content of the meal), high -calorie 
meal (approximately  800 to 1000 calories) will be the representative example given by  
the 2002 US FDA guidance [FDA,2002]. It includes the following: two eggs fried in 
butter, two strips of bacon, two slic es of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown 
potatoes and eight ounces of whole milk.
In order to reduce variability  in measurement of drug exposure caused by  day-to-day 
biologic variation, a small (<10% of total dose) liquid dose of GSK525762, a sta ble, non -
radioactive 13C isotope labeled version of GSK525762 besy late salt, will be 
coadministered orally with each fasted treatment in besy late sub -study  to serve as an 
internal standard for quantitation purposes (Refer to Section 7.1 for additional 
information). Use of this stable isotope approach will allow better characterization of the 
impact of the bes ylate salt and dose on GSK525762 bioavailability , if an y (Parr, 2012).

Rationale for change: A window for visits in the besy late sub -study  was included.
Added Text, Paragraph 9:
Besylate Sub -Study -+1 day  window is allowed as long as there are at least 48 hours 
between the single doses.
Section 6.2 .Baseline A ssessment for NMC Subjects
Rationale for change: Clarification was included for baseline assessments for NMC 
subjects.
Revised Text, Paragraph 2:
Further retrospective FISH testing will be undertaken for all enrolled NMC subjects in 
order to id entify characterize the BRD3 or BRD 4NUT gene fusion partner and to support 
exploratory  anal ysis of differential outcomes based on the NUT fusion partner. The cut -
off for FISH positivity  has not been robustly  established but will be assessed during 
develop ment. The IHC and FISH analy ses will be performed at a central laboratory .
Section 6.3. Baseline A ssessment for Non- NMC Subjects
Rationale for change(s): Additional tumor ty pes were added and MM removed from this 
section.
Revised Text, Paragraph 1:
Subjec ts diagnosed with SCL C, CRC , NB, CRPC, TNBC, ER+BC or NSCLC or MM
[based on standard diagnostic criteria, such as histology , cytology  (including bone 
marrow evaluation)] or serological criteria (such as serum M -protein) will be considered 
eligible for Part 1 of the study .  In instances where a solid tumor subject’s MYCN 
amplification status is known, then that subject will be co nsidered eligible.  N -Myc copy  
number gain of ≥5 will be considered positive for MYCN amplification. N -Myc testing 
may be performed using any  method.
Table 23   QT Withdrawal Criteria
Rationale for change: Lowered QTcF withdrawal upper limit from 500 to 48 0 to be 
consistent with GSK QT withdrawal criteria.Removed reference to subjects with 
underly ing bundle branch block, as these subjects are exluded from trial. Baseline QT 
results was defined.

If QTcF > 500480msec, or uncorrected QT > 600 ms ec (Grade 3 or 4), or any change from 
*baseline of ≥60 msec even if not exceeding 500480msec, (all measurements based on an 
averaged manual overread of three ECGs over at least 15 minutes) permanently discontinue study 
medications and notify the GSK Medical Monitor.
For subjects with underlyin g bundle branch block, follow the criteria below: *Baseline results are 
defined by the nearest timepoint prior to first dose. For this trial the Baseline QTcF value is 
determined by the mean of the triplicate W1D1 predose QTcF results. If these results ar e not 
available, then the mean QTcF of the screening triplicate ECG results would be used.

Section 6.4.7. Telemetry
Rationale for change: Flexible language to allow removal of telemetry  requirement after 
all data is collected up to MTD and anal yzed for QT safet y and reviewed b y our safet y 
board was included.
Revised Text:
ToIn Part 1 to complement real -time ECG assessemen tsassessments, monitoring for 
potential adverse arrh ythmias will be conducted utilizing continuous telemetry  will be 
performed monitoring as outlined in the Time and Events Tables for at least 48 hours 
from the start of dose. If clinically  indicated, telem etry may  be extended past 48 hours. 
Participating sites will have trained staff capable of monitoring and responding in real 
time to any  potential cardiac adverse event detected by  telemetry . In addition, emergency  
resuscitation equipment including appropr iate pharmacological agents will also be 
immediately  accessible.
At the end of Part 1, an analy sis of data collected on the QT interval up to, and including, 
the MTD expansion will be carried out. If the analysis b y the GSK Cardiac Safety Panel 
of internal and external experts indicates that telemetry  is no longer required for 
monitoring the QT interval, then the study  can progress to the next stage without 
telemetry . 
Removal of the telemetry requirement will be convey ed to the sites in the first instance 
through a separate document (or “note to file”) that will note - i) a summary  of the 
analysis, and ii) the decision to proceed without telemetry  monitoring in the next stage of 
this study . This will allow the sites to submit the necessary documentation to the 
IECs/IRBs for approval and to start the next stage of this study  without telemetry . 
However, this process will be permitted only  if there are no other cardiac monitoring 
changes to be implemented. If additional cardiac monitoring changes are required, a 
protocol amendment will be necessary  before the next stage of the study  can start.

Section 6.5.1.  Disease A ssessmen t
Rationale for change: Disease assessment updated to include PCWG2 guidelines for 
CRPC subjects.
Revised Text , Paragraph 1:
Tumor response will be assessed as outlined in Time and Event Schedule by the 
investigator using RECI ST 1.1 (Appendix 4) or the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 
(PCWG2) guidelines and documented in the eCRF as: progressive disease (PD), stable 
disease (SD), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR).  For subjects with MM 
orNB the appropriate tests and criteria will be followed (See Time and Events Schedule, 
Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 ). See the SPM for additional instructions.
Section 6.6.3.  Urine Collection
Rationale for change: Pooled urine sample collection timepoints was adjusted to reflect 
sample collections for both QD and BID dosing cohorts.
Revised Text, Paragraph 1:
Urine samples for quantitative anal ysis of GSK525762 will be collected over 24 a dosing 
interval hours in two samples (sample collected 0 -2hr and second sample collected 2 -
24hrend of dosing interval hr ) immedi ately following dosing on Week 1 Day  1 and in 
Week 3. Urine samples will be collected in subjects in Part 1A (with the exclusion of 
besylate sub -study ) once the 3+3 dose escalation has been reached. Additional sampling 
may be instituted based on emerging data.  
Section 6.8. Translational Research
Rationale for change: Minor updates were made to this section to clarify that pre- and 
post-treatment biopsy  collections are mandated during the 3+3 design (when there is 
accessible tumor tissue).
Revised Text, Paragraph 2 and 3:
NMC patients will be required to submit a fresh or archival tumor specimen for diagnosis 
or diagnostic confirmation. These archival specimens may  also be evaluated 
retrospectivel y for exploratory  research. Selected During the 3+3 design NMC patients 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
303will also be required to supply  fresh pre and post- treatment biopsies to test for relevant 
markers of tumor PD and/or biological effect and to support identification of a 
biologicall y effective dose.
Non-NMC patients will also be asked to submit an archival tumor specimen for 
retrospective testing for potential markers of sensitivity  and/or resistance, eg. N -Myc 
amplification; however this will not be an eligibility  requirement. Furthermore, as for 
NMC patients, selected during the 3+3 design non-NMC patients will be required to 
supply  fresh pre and post- treatment biopsies for tumor PD. 
Section 6.8.1.  Tumor Tissue Collection
Rationale for change: This section was updated to reflect exploratory  analy sis planned 
and to remove reference to multiple myeloma.
Revised Text, Paragraph 5:
The biopsies will be assessed for transcripts or proteins that reflect BET target 
engagement and/or tumor biology  (e.g., c -Myc protein level changes in multiple 
myeloma; changes in expression of genes important in SCL C tumorigenesis such as 
CCND1, SRC, NMYC and ML KL; changes in NMYC expression and protein in 
neuroblastoma) .  For NMC, markers of cell proliferation and/or cell differentiation (e.g., 
Ki67 and cy tokeratin [Schwartz, 2011]) will be analy zed.  Biopsies may  also be assessed 
for DNA, RNA or proteins which may  be potential predictors of sensitivity  or resistance 
to BET inhibition based on emerging data.
Section 6.8.2.3.  Whole Blood mRNA
Rationale for change: This section was updated to reflect current exploratory  analysis 
planned for mRNA samples.
Revised Text, Paragraph 1:
GSK525762 has been shown to modulate the expression of a number of different genes in 
unstimulated whole blood between 1 h and 6 h. The mRNA levels of 31 such genes form 
a ‘signature’ panel whic h will also be used as a biomarker of engagement of 
pharmacology . Aand will be measured using mRNA isolated from whole blood. The 
modulation of a number of these genes will also be measured as changes in sy stemic 
proteins as well as in the analytes from analysis of the ex vivo assay  blood samples (e.g. 
CCL2 and IL -8) thus relating mRNA and protein expression with drug concentration.  
Other translational research studies, such as transcriptomics profiling, will also be 
performed using whole blood mRNA from selected patients.

GSK525762 Tablets are to be stored at up to 30°C (86°F ).) and protected from light and 
moisture.
Section 7.3. Meals and Dietary  Restrictions
Rationale for change: Instructions for meals and dietary restrictions were updated with 
information for bes ylate sub -study .
Revised Text, Paragraph 1:
Subjects will fast for at least one hour prior to each dose of study  drug. After dosing, 
subjects will be asked to fast for an additional two hours.  These fasting requirements 
have been implemented in the protocol and informed consents to minimize 
pharmacokinetic variability . During Bes yalte Sub -Study , subjects will be asked to fast 
overnight (at least 8 hours) and continue fasting for 4 hours post dose administration 
except for the fed administration where subject will be requested to ingest a high -fat 
high-calorie meal within 30 minutes prior to administration (FDA 2002).

Section 11.1.  Sample Size A ssumptions
Rationale for change:
Revised Text: Updates were made to sample size assumptions to include rationale f or 
sample size for bes ylate sub -study .
Section 11.1.1.   Part 1
The total number of subjects to be enrolled into Part 1 1A and Part 1B will depend on the 
number of dose escalations required to establish the maximum tolerated dose of 
GSK525762; they  are not driven by  statistical considerations. To complete Part 1, it is 
estimated that 3050to 5070evaluable subjects will be enrolled. 
Section 11.1.2.   Part 1A Besylate Sub- Study
At least 8 and up to 12 subjects will participate in Bes ylate Sub- Study .  
Approx imately  12 subjects will participate in the assessment to get at least 8 evaluable 
patients completing.  A subject is considered a completer if they  have PK assessments 
from all treatment periods.
Based on a within -subject coefficient of variance for AUC o f 50%, a correlation of 0.95 
between the enriched (liquid dose of GSK525762 added) and non- enriched PK, and 8 
subjects completing in Besy late Sub -Study , it is estimated that the half -width of the 90% 
CI for the ratio of the geometric means (bes ylate salt t ablet compared to the amorphous 
free-base tablet) will be approximately  0.20.  Hence, if the ratio estimate is equal to 1, the 
90% CI  will be 0.80 to 1.25.

Assay Validation Pharmacodynamic Population :Due to the rarity  of NMC disease, 
the Assay  Validation population The PD Population is defined as all subjects who were 
consented, screened in the All Treated Subjects Population for the study  (regardless if the 
subject met eligibility  requirements for s tudy enrollment) and whose whom a tumor

Section 11.7. Pharmacokinetic A nalyses
Rationale for chan ge:This section was updated to further define subjects included in the 
PK population and to include plans for analy ses for the bes ylate sub- study .
Revised Text:
11.7.1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters
PK analy ses will be the responsibility  of Clinical Pharmaco kinetics/Modelling & 
Simulation, GSK. Plasma GSK525762 concentration- time data from dose escalation (Part 
1) will be anal yzed by non -compartmental methods with WinNonlin.
From the plasma concentration -time data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters wil l 
be determined, as data permit: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to 
Cmax (tmax), area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC(0-t) and AUC(0- ∞) 
Week1 Day 1 onl y) and apparent terminal phase half -life (t½). Trough concentration (C )
samples collected on the specified day s will be used to assess attainment of steady  state. 
To estimate the extent of accumulation after repeat dosing, the observed accumulation 
ratio (Ro) may  be determined. The ratio of AUC(0 -) on Week 3 AUC(0 -) / Week 1 
AUC(0 -) will be calculated to assess time invariance. GSK525762 concentrations will 
be determined in urine samples to determine urinary  recovery  of unchanged drug and 
renal clearance.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
31211.7.2. Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters
Statistica l analy ses of the PK parameters data will be conducted by  Discovery  
Biometrics, GSK. Plasma concentration- time data will be listed by  dose, age group, and 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) 
by planned relativ e assessment time. Mean and/ or median values will be plotted over 
time. I ndividual plasma and urinary  (if available) pharmacokinetic parameters values as 
well as a descriptive summary  (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, 
geometric mean, an d the standard deviation, CV% and 95% confidence interval of log -
transformed parameters (if applicable)) b y dose cohort and age group will be reported. 
Dose proportionality 
Cmax and AUC (AUC(0- ∞), single dose, and AUC(0 -), stead y state) from Part 1 willbe 
plotted as a function of the dose administered. If more than 2 dose cohorts are required to 
reach MTD (or the recommended dose based on available safet y, PK and response data), 
dose proportionality  of AUC and Cmax for GSK525762 following single dose 
administration and AUC(0 -) and Cmax following repeat dose administration will be 
assessed graphicall y and using the power model (details will be provided in the Reporting 
and Anal ysis Plan [RAP]). as described below:
log (pharmacokinetic parameter) = a + b * log(dose)
where a is the intercept and b is the slope.
The power model will be fitted by  restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using SAS 
Proc Mixed.  Both the intercept and slope will be fitted as fixed effects.  If there is 
sufficient data, the model may also be fit with the intercept and/or slope as random 
effects depending on the ability  of the model to converge and on estimation of variance-
covariance matrix.  The mean slope and corresponding 90% confidence interval will be 
estimated from the power mod el.  
Separate models will be evaluated for amorphous tablet and bes ylate salt. 
Relative bioavailability of the besylate salt tablet to the amorphous tablet ( Besylate 
Sub-Study)
Based on the US FDA guidance on relative bioavailability  studies, two formul ations will 
be considered bioequivalent if the 90% CI of the ratio for Cmax and AUC, based on
log-transformed data, is within the 80 to 125% equivalence limit. Recommendation on
the dose amount impact of a deviation from bioequivalence with the besy late sa lt will be 
based on the magnitude of the change.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
313Food effect with besylate salt tablet (Besylate Sub -Study)
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters AUC(0 -∞), and Cmax will be loge -transformed and 
analyzed using a mixed- effects model with and without food will be a nalyzed separately  
with fixed -effect terms for fed status (fed or fasted), and subject as a random effect. Point 
estimates and their associated 90% CIs will be constructed for the differences between 
fed and in fasted state. The point estimates and their associated 90% CIs were then 
backtransformed to provide point estimates and 90% CI s for the ratios of fed/fasted. Non-
parametric methods such as the Hodges and Lehmann estimator will be used to estimate 
the median differences between the fed treatments and the fasted state treatments for 
tmax. An associated 90% CI  for the median differences will be constructed.
Based on the US FDA guidance on food -effect bioavailability  studies, the absence of a 
food-effect will be established if the 90% CI of the ratio for Cmax and AUC, based on 
log-transformed data, is within the 80 to 125% equivalence limit. Recommendation on 
the clinical significance of the effect of food will be based on the magnitude of the 
change and our understanding of the exposure -clinical response relationship.
For the evaluation of food effect, tmax at fed and fasted status will be presented b y 
subject and dose cohort in tabular and graphical form.
Section 11.7.3. Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Section 11.8. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacody namic A nalyses
Rationale for change: Minor updates were included to further clarify  plans for PK/PD 
analyses.
Revised Text, Paragraph 2, 3 and 4:
The relationship between QTcF and concentration expressed as Cmax, Cav, and /or
instantaneous time -matched concentration will be plotted graphicall y.evaluated. A linear 
or non- linear mixed effects analy sis of the slope of the relationship between QTcF
adjusted for baseline and –concentration responses adjusting for baseline with a possible 
incorporation of time will be ev aluated as a means of estimating QTcF effect in lieu of a 
thorough QT stud y.
Other quantitative safet y parameters and biomarkers of interest including changes in 
tropinin, insulin and blood glucose levels will be plotted graphicall y against summary 
exposur e measures (eg; Cmax, Ctrough, and Cav). Where evidence of a signal is seen, 
linear and non -linear mixed effect models will be fitted to the data to estimate PKPD 
parameters of interest; slope, baseline (E0), location concentration for 50% of maximum 
effect (EC50) and maximum effect (Emax).
Overall efficacy  data, as assessed by  conventional RECI ST 1.1 criteria (best confirmed 
response) and overall tumor burden, will may be described using ordered categorical 
model and continuous models with summary  exposure parameters (eg; Cmax, Ctrough, 
and Cav) as covariates derived from the population PK analy sis. Further model details 
will be provided in the Reporting and Anal ysis Plan [RAP].

normal free light chain (FL C) ratio and
absence of clonal cells in bone marrow b y immunohistochemistry  or 2-4 color 
flow cy tometry  
CR (complete response) :
Negative serum and urine immunofixation, and
Disappearance of an y soft tissue plasmacy tomas, and
5% plasma cells in bone marrow 
VGPR (very good partial response):
Serum and urine M -component detectable b y immunofixation but not on 
electrophoresis  OR
90% or greater reduction in serum M -component plus urine M -component < 
100mg/24h
PR (partial response):
50% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 hour urinary  M-protein 
by 90% or to < 200mg/24h, and 
If the serum and urine M -protein are not m easurable, a 50% decrease in the 
difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain levels is required in 
place of the M -protein criteria.  If serum and urine M -protein are not 
measurable, and serum free light chain assay  is also not measurable, 50% 
reduction in bone marrow plasma cells is required in place of M -protein, 
provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was 30%, and
In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a 50% reduction 
in the size of the soft tissue plasmacy tomas is also required.

316MR (minimal response):
25% but 49% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 hour urinary  
M-protein b y 50% to 89%, AND
If present at baseline, 25% to 49% reduction in the size of soft tissue 
plasmacy tomas is also required.
No increase in size or number of l ytic bone lesions (development of 
compression fracture does not exclude response).
SD (stable disease):
Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, MR or PD
PD (progressive disease): 
Requires an y one or more of the following
Increase of 25% from lowest response value in any  one or more of the following: 
serum M -component (absolute increase must be 0.5 g/dl), or 
urine M -component (absolute increase must be 200 mg/24h), or
the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain levels (absolute 
increase must be > 10mg/dl): only  for patients without measurable serum and 
urine M -protein levels,  or 
bone marrow plasma cell percentage (the absolute % must be 10%) –only for 
patients without measurabl e serum and urine M -protein levels and without 
measurable disease b y FLC level
definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or 
definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacy tomas
development of h ypercalcemia (corrected calcium > 11.5 mg/dl or 2.65 mmol/l) 
that can be attributed solely  to the plasma cell proliferative disorder
a.All response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, PR,MR and PD) require two consecutive 
assessments made at an y time before the instituti on of an y new therap y; CR, sCR, 
VGPR, PR, MR, and SD categories also require no known evidence of progressive or 
new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. VGPR and CR categories 
require serum and urine studies regardless of whether disease a t baseline was 
measurable on serum, urine, both, or neither. Radiographic studies are not required to 
satisfy  these response requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed. 
For PD, serum M -component increases of more than or equal to 1 g/dL ar e sufficient 
to define relapse if starting M -component is ≥ 5 g/dL .
b.Clarifications to I MWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in whom the 
only measurable disease is by  serum FLC levels: CR in such patients indicates a 
normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1 .65 in addition to CR criteria listed above. VGPR in such 
patients requires a > 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved 
FLC levels. 
c.Clarifications to I MWG criteria for coding PD: Bone marrow criteria for PD are to be 
used only  in pa tients without measurable disease by  M protein and by  FLC levels;

Study Design And Duration: 
Rationale for Change : This section was updated to include the additional expansion 
cohorts for Part 2 (CRPC, TNBC, ER positive and SCL C), to clarify  that the sub -study  
would be conducted in the US only  and remove reference of the pediatric cohort (Part 
1B).
Revised Text:
This study  is divided into 2 parts: 
Part 1A 1 of the stud y is a dos e escalation phase to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and select a recommended dose for Part 2 or a 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on the safet y, pharmacokinetic, 
and pharmacod ynamic profiles observed after oral administration of 
GSK525762. Eligible subjects with NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), small 
cell lung cancer (SCL C), non -small cell lung cancer (NSCL C), colorectal 
cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrog en receptor positive 
(ER positive) breast cancer, and an y other MYCN -amplified solid tumor will 
be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is 
established.  Subjects with NMC will also be enrolled in a pharmacod ynamic 
dose expansion cohort during Part 1A1.  Subjects may  continue treatment in 
the study  until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal of 
consent.   
Part 1A 1besylate sub- study  will explore the relative bioavailability , food 
effect and dose proportion ality of bes ylate formulation. The sub- study  will be 
conducted at active centers in the United States in subjects eligible for Part 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L

3221A1 at the MTD or a dose near the MTD or RP2D. This will be an open -
label, randomized, single dose, four period, cross over sub-study  to 
investigate the relative bioavailability  of the bes ylate tablet compared to the 
amorphous free -base tablet, the effect of high -fat high- calorie meal on the 
bioavailability  of the besy late tablet and the dose proportionality  of two doses 
of GSK 525762 administered as bes ylate tablets.
Part 1B will be opened to enroll pediatric subjects 12 to ≤15 y ears of age with 
solid tumors to determine the MTD in pediatric subjects.  Dose escalation in 
Part 1B will begin at 25% of the adult MTD and dose escala tion will follow a 
3+3 design.  Pediatric subjects 12 to ≤15 years old may  be enrolled in Part 2 
once the MTD has been determined in Part 1B.
Part 2 is an expansion cohort planned to further explore clinical activity  at the 
MTD in NMC , SCL C, CRPC, and TN and ER positive BC subjects  
Duration of stud y will depend on recruitment rates, and timing of subjects’ 
duration on study  (withdrawal rates due to toxicity  or progression).
Subject Sample
Rationale for Change : The overall subject numbers were increased to accommodate 
enrolment into additional expansion cohorts added to Part 2 (CRPC, TNBC, ER+BC and 
SCLC).
Revised Text:
Approximately  70-100 subjects worldwide. Worldwide approximately  60 subjects will be 
enrolled in Part 1, and approximately 150 subjects wi ll be enrolled in Part 2.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Measurements: 
Rationale for Change : Minor updates were made to this section to provide further 
clarification on planned cytokine testing.
Revised Text:
There is extensive pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling in Part 1 and limited PK sampling in 
Part 2 for this study . Single safet y PK blood draws may be collected for subjects with 
severe adverse events oradverse events of concern.  Blood samples will be collected for 
analysis of protein biomarkers (cy tokines and acute phase proteins) and mRNA. Ex-vivo
LPS induction of cy tokines in whole blood will be assessed. In addition, pre- treatment 
and post -treatment tumor samples will alsobe collected from selected subjects to be 
evaluated for target engagement and effects of GSK525762 on tumor biology . 
Data Analysis
Rationale for Change : Minor updates were made to this section to clarify and reflect 
that futility  assessments would be conducted for each expansion cohort, now that 
additional cohorts have been added to Part 2.

Paragraph 5 :
NMC is extremely  rare (fewer than 100 cases have been identified globall y to date), 
andwith approximately  20 cases being reported in the United States annually , however 
due to misdiagnosis or underd iagnosis, the exact incidence and frequency  of NMC are 
not well established (http://www.nmcregistry .org/). NMC may affect subjects of all ages 
(age range 0- 78 yrs). The only  known long -term survivor had a complete tumor resection. 
Therefore, patients with this rare tumor have a significant unmet medical need for more 
effective therap y.

Section 1.3.1 Human Pharmacokinetics
Rationale for Change: Updates wer e made to this section based on emerging data.
Revised Text
Whole blood human clearance was predicted from three species (mouse, rat and dog) 
using simple power -law allometry  (in the absence of detectable in vitro metabolism) to be 
2.8 ml/min/kg. Volume of distribution was predicted from Gastroplus to be 2.6 L /kg and 
half-life 10 hours (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2010N108204_00, 2011). As the 
in vitro blood to plasma ration was 0.86, a 70 kg adult therefore hashad a predicted total 
clearance of 10.1 L/ hr and a total plasma volume of distribution of 157 L . Bioavailability  
is predicted to be high given GSK525762 is a Bio -pharmaceutics Classification Sy stem 
(BCS) Class 1 molecule, and assumed to fall in the range 50 -100% .
As of 23 -July-2014 of 06 -February -2015, the pharmacokinetics of GSK525762 has been 
evaluated in 19 23subjects following single and repeated dail y administration of 2 mg to 
60 mg of GSK525762 in the BET115521 trial . The summary  statistics of the preliminary  
PK parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 after single and repeat dail y oral

325administration, respectively . GSK525762 pharmacokinetics are characterized by  a rapid 
absorption with maximum concentration occurring mostly  within the first hour after 
dosing. GSK525762 is eliminated ra pidly  with an average terminal phase half -life of 3 to 
7 hours, leading to a lack of accumulation following once dail y oral administration. 
Following single oral administration and repeated once dail y administration of 2 mg to 60 
mg of GSK525762, C maxand AUC tended to increase in a dose proportional fashion with 
a full overlap for individual AUC between 30 and 60 mg cohorts.

tumor ty pes such as relapsed/refractory  SCL C, NSCL C,CRC, MM, CRPC, TN and ER+ 
BC, NB and N- Myc amplified tumors and the exceptional drug- to- target alignment of 
GSK525762, a combined Phase I/II stud y (BET115521) is propose d. The BET115521 
study  comprises an accelerated dose titration (Part 1), which will include subjects with 
NMC and other tumor types that are predicted to be responsive to GSK525762, to 
determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The besy late sub -study  will b e an open -

334Section 3.2.7 Part 2 Expansion Cohort
Rationale for Change: The overall enrolment num bers were updated to accommodate 
enrolment of additional subjects into the supplementary  expansion cohorts now included 
with this amendment. This section also includes information on the predictive probability  
design and the futility  assessments planned for each cohort in Part 2.
Revised Text
Up to 40 Approximately  150 subjects with NMC may, SCLC, CRPC, TNBC and ER+BC 
willbe enrolled in anexpansion cohort at the RP2D (appropriate to each age group) to 
gather more safet y data and to further assess anti -tumo r activity .  Pediatric subjects 12 to 
≤15 y ears old may  be enrolled in Part 2 once the MTD has been determined in Part 1B.
Subjects in Part 2 will start with a continuous daily dosing schedule unless safet y, PK or 
PD data necessitate a different dosing sch edule. The final dose and regimen for Part 2 
will be decided upon completion of dose escalation in Part 1A and Part 1B for the 
respective age groups 1.
For purposes of assessing activity , it will be assumed that the maximum response rate for 
an ineffective drug is 0.05 and the minimum response rate for an effective drug is 0.20. 
Futility  assessment will be conducted after data are available from the first 20 subjects. 
Safety  from all prior subjects, will be reviewed along with this response data (and PK/PD 
and biomarker data when available) for consideration regarding expansion cohorts.
The statistical design and number of subjects to be enrolled in a cohort is based on the 
predictive probability  of success if enrollment continues until all planned subjects a re 
recruited [Lee, 2008]. The predictive probability  design allows for evaluation of stopping 
rules after each subject once a minimum number of subjects are evaluable.   I n this 
particular stud y, we will stop only  for futility . Final decisions on stopping enrollment will 
depend on the totality  of the data collected.
For NMC, once 10 subjects have been enrolled into the expansion cohort to examine 
safet y and efficacy, if 0 responses are observed, further enrolment into this cohort may  be 
terminated. The n umber of observed confirmed responses will guide further enrolment 
according to the rules summarized in Figure 3 . A maximum of 40 subjects in this cohort 
will be enrolled at the RP2D.  All available data will be considered in making enrollment 
decisions.

For SCL Cand CRPC, once 10 subjects have been enrolled in the cohort to examine 
safet y and efficacy, if 0 responses are observed in either cohort, further enrolment into 
this cohort may  be terminated. The number of observed confirmed responses will guide 
further e nrolment according to the rules summarized in Figure 4. A maximum of 22

enrollment decisions.

Section 4.1 Number of Subjects
Rationale for Change: Overall enrolment numbers were updated in this section.
Revised Text
Paragraph 1 :
The number of dose levels and the level at which the MTD will be reached cannot be 
determined in advance. An adequa te number of subjects will be enrolled into the study  to 
establish a recommended dose(s) and schedule(s) of GSK525762 for further study . To 
complete Part 1A and Part 1B 1, it is estimated 30 to 50 60 evaluable subjects will be 
enrolled. The besy late sub -study will enroll approximately  10 to 12 evaluable subjects in 
the United States only .  Part 2 will enroll approximately  40 NMC 150 subjects.

Section 6.4.5 Safety  Electrocardiograms
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to ensure consistency  with new QTc 
management guidelines.
Revised Text
Paragraph 2 onwards :
In addition to the S afety ECGs performed during the study , continuous 12 -lead Holter 
ECGs (obtained via a Holter monitor) will be acquired while subjects are at the site. Dual 
snap electrodes will be utilized to enable simultaneous collection of Holter and safet y 
ECG data.
All ECGs must include QTcF measurements. Those values greater than 480 msec as 
calculated b y the machine must be confirmed manually using Fridericia’s formula given 
below:
The Fridericia’s formula is: QTcF=QT x (1/[RR/1000])1/3
If there are an y clinicall y significant abnormalities including but not limited to a 
QTcF >480 msec, confirm with two additional ECGs taken at least 5 minutes apart.
Table 23 QT Withdrawal Criteria
If QTcF > 480 msec, or uncorrected QT > 600 msec (Grade 3 or 4), or any change from *bas eline 
of ≥60 msec even if not exceeding 480 msec, (all measurements based on an averaged manual 
overread of three ECGs over at least 15 minutes) permanently discontinue study medications and 
notify the GSK Medical Monitor.
*Baseline results are defined by the nearest timepoint prior to first dose. For this trial the Baseline 
QTcF value is determined by the mean of the triplicate W1D1 predose QTcF results. If these 
results are not available, then the mean QTcF of the screening triplicate ECG results would be 
used.
If a subject meets the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration criteria below, study  
treatment(s) will be withheld.
QTc interval ≥ 500 msec OR interval increase from baseline  60 msec: I P 
will be discontinued unless the benefits of therap y outweigh the risk of

354rechallenge in the opinion of the Investigator, the GSK Medical Monitor, as 
well as the GSK medical governance . In this situation, rechallenge may  be 
permitted (see Table 25 for rechallenge guidelines).
NOTE: QT interval duration criteria should be based on the average QTc value of 
triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) to include manual over- read. For example, if an 
ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, obtain 2 additional ECGs over a brief period 
(e.g., within approximately  10 minutes of the abnormal ECG, if possible, and 
approximately  10 minutes apart from each other), and then use the averaged QTc values 
of the 3 ECGs to determine whether the subjects should have study  treatment 
discontinued.
The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula 
(QTcF). 
For eligibility  and withdrawal, QTcF will be used for all subjects. 
For p urposes of data analy sis, QTcF will be used.
Baseline results are defined by the nearest timepoint prior to first dose. For this trial the 
Baseline QTcF value is determined b y the mean of the triplicate W1D1 predose QTcF 
results. If these results are not available, then the mean QTcF of the screening triplicate 
ECG results would be used.
Abnormal ECGs should be evaluated manuall y prior to final decision making. ECG data 
may be transferred and reviewed by  an independent central reviewer. Instructions for 
submission of qualify ing ECHOs scans are provided in the SPM. 
Table 21  Clinical Laboratory  Tests
Rationale for Change: The requirement for stool guaiac testing (fecal occult blood 
testing) was eliminated after discussion with the clinical and safet y teams to achieve 
alignment across all GSK BET inhibitor protocols. Any recent evidence of overt 
gastrointestinal bleeding will remain exclusionary .

Urine samples f or quantitative anal ysis of GSK525762 will be collected at pre -dose and 
over a dosing interval hours in two samples (sample collected 0 -2hr and second sample 
collected 2 -end of dosing intervalhr) immediatel y following dosing on Week 1 Day  1 and 
in Week 3. Urine samples will be collected in subjects in Part 1A1(with the exclusion of 
besylate sub -study ) once the 3+3 dose escalation has been reached. Additional sampling 
may be instituted based on emerging data.  
Section 6.8 Translational Research
Rationale f or Change: This section was revised and reworded to provide additional 
rationale, details and clarification on the translational research strategy  for this study .
Revised Text
Blood and/or tumor tissue specimens will be collected at various times throughou t the 
study  in order to support research aimed at identify ing indicators of sensitivity/resistance 
to GSK525762 and, understanding the biological effect of GSK525762 and BET 
inhibition , and also to support diagnostic assay development for NMC . 
Toward that end the successful collection of quality  tumor specimens will be critical to 
furthering our understanding of BET biology  and indentify ing the best way  to treat 
patients with a BET inhibitor. Specificall y, the evaluation of responders, responders at 
relaps e, and non -responders for gene mutation status and/or pathway  activation may  lead 
to the discovery  of potential new diagnostic markers or novel combinations. Similarly , 
pre-and post -dose tumor specimens will be evaluated for markers of target engagement, 
tumor response, and/or evaluated for changes in gene expression; thus supporting 
identification of a biologically  effective dose and furthering our mechanistic 
understanding of BET inhibition in these settings. 
The biopsies will be assessed for transcripts or proteins that reflect BET target 
engagement and/or tumor biology  (For NMC, markers of cell proliferation and/or cell 
differentiation (e.g., Ki67 and cy tokeratin [Schwartz, 2011]) will be analyzed. Biopsies 
may also be assessed for DNA, RNA or proteins which may  be potential predictors of 
sensitivity  or resistance to BET inhibition based on emerging data.
6.8.1 Tumor Tissue Collection
NMC patients will be required to submit a fresh or archival tumor specimen for diagnosis 
or diagnostic confirmation. The se archival specimens may  also be evaluated 
retrospectivel y for exploratory  research . During the 3+3 design NMC patients will also 
be required to supply  fresh pre and post -treatment biopsies to test for relevant markers of 
tumor PD and/or biological effect and to support identification of a biologically  effective 
dose.as described above . 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
356NonAll non -NMC patients will also be asked to submit an archival tumor specimen for 
retrospective testing for potential markers of sensitivity  and/or resistance, eg. N -Myc 
amplification; however this will not be an eligibility  requirement. Furthermore, as for 
NMC patients, during the 3+3 design non-NMC patients will be required to supply  fresh 
pre and post -treatment biopsies for tumor PD. 
During the accelerated dose escal ation phase (Part 1), fresh pre -and post -dose biopsy  
collections will be optional until the standard 3+3 design is implemented.  During the 3+3 
dose escalation phase in Part 1, and during Part 2, pre- and post -treatment biopsies are 
mandatory . For subject s in Part 1 and 2, if tumor tissue is not accessible, discussion with 
the GSK medical monitor is required. 
Archival tissue may  be accepted as a pre -treatment specimen if the subject is treatment 
naïve. Specific timing of post -treatment sample collection i s defined in the T&E table. 
See Study  Procedures Manual (SPM) and central lab manual for additional details.
Blood samples collected at time points described in the Time and Events tables for PK 
and PD testing will be required for all subjects.
6.8.1 Tumor Tissue Collection
During the accelerated dose escalation phase (Part 1A), biopsy  assessments will be 
optional until the standard 3+3 design is implemented.  Once the 3+3 design is 
implemented in Part 1A, sites will be required to obtain pre -and post -treatment biopsies 
(when tumor tissue is accessible). 
Up to 6 additional subjects per dose level may be enrolled and required to consent to pre 
and post treatment biopsies during the 3+3 dose escalation, for a maximum of 9 subjects 
per cohort until MTD is rea ched. Up to12 additional subjects may  be enrolled and 
required to consent to pre and post treatment biopsies at the MTD for a maximum of 18 
subjects (tumor tissue may be collected from one or more histological subtypes). 
Additional biopsy  patients will hel p determine biologically effective dose(s) and provide 
additional safet y data. The goal is to obtain evaluable tissue biopsies from approximately  
8-10 subjects at MTD and 4 -6 subjects at lower dose levels. This may  occur in -stream 
before reaching MTD based upon adverse events or response profile. The tumor ty pes 
appropriate for biops y and pharmacod ynamic evaluation may  be restricted to a few 
specific tumor types/subtypes based on emerging pre -clinical data. Depending upon the 
emerging safety  profile, Part 2 of the study  may  begin after enrollment of 6 subjects at 
the MTD or after determination of a biologically  effective dose. Tumor biopsies will be 
optional for subjects below age 16 in either Part 1B or Part 2.
Archival tissue may  be accepted as a pre -treatment specimen if the subject is treatment 
naïve.   Specific timing of post -treatment sample collection will be based upon tumor ty pe 
and emergent data.  See Study  Procedures Manual (SPM) for details.
For subjects with accessible tumor and who have signed th e appropriate consent form the 
procedure will consist of approximately  3 core needle biopsies of the same accessible 
target tumor at the designated pre and post treatment time points.  Where feasible, 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L

357biopsies are requested at time of progression. Further details regarding the biopsy  
procedure and how to process the tumor samples will be provided in the SPM.
The biopsies will be assessed for transcripts or proteins that reflect BET target 
engagement and/or tumor biology  (For NMC, markers of cell proliferati on and/or cell 
differentiation (e.g., Ki67 and cy tokeratin [Schwartz, 2011]) will be analyzed.  Biopsies 
may also be assessed for DNA, RNA or proteins which may  be potential predictors of 
sensitivity  or resistance to BET inhibition based on emerging data.

11.1.1 Part 1
The total number of subjects to be enrolled into Part 1A and Part 1B will 1will depend on 
the number of dose esca lations required to establish the maximum tolerated dose of 
GSK525762; they  are not driven by  statistical considerations. To complete Part 1, it is 
estimated that 50 to 70 evaluable subjects will be enrolled.
11.1.2 Part 1A Besylate Sub -Study
Doses to be s tudied in Part 1 will be guided b y calculating the posterior probability  that  
the DLT rate falls within an acceptable range for each subsequent dose after each dose 
cohort observation period.  The N-CRM method will be used to calculate posterior 
probabili ties utilizing a pre- specified prior distribution.
11.1.2 Besylate Sub -Study
Paragraph 1:
At least 8 and up to 12 USsubjects will participate in Bes ylate Sub -Study .  
11.1.3 Part 2
UpThe primary  goal of Part 2 is to 40 evaluate disease -specific efficacy  in subjects in 
with NMC, SCL C, CRPC, TNBC and ER+BC. .
For NMC, efficacy  is defined as a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined as 
the NMC expansion percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR or PR) of 20% 
relative to a 5% response rate suggesting no activity
For CRPC and SCL C, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate 
(defined as a percentage of subjects that have achieved as CR or PR) of 30% 
relative to a 10% response rate suggesting no activity .
For TNBC, efficacy  is defined a s a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined as 
a percentage of subjects that have achieved as CR or PR) of 25% relative to a 
10% response rate suggesting no activity.
For ER+BC, efficacy  is defined as a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined 
as a percentage of subjects that have achieved as CR or PR) of 30% relative to a 
15% response rate suggesting no activity.
Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the predictive probability  that the 
response rate is greater than the historic respons e rate at interim anal yses using a 
weak/non -informative prior. A Bay esian analy sis expresses uncertaint y about a parameter 
in terms of probability .  A prior distribution is defined to characterize the level of 
knowledge about a parameter before the data ar e collected.  Once the data are collected, a 
posterior distribution is formed using the prior distribution and the observed data.  A very  
weak prior Beta distribution with a mean response rate equal to the target response rate is 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
363assumed.  Thus, the poster ior distribution for the response rate will be primarily  driven by  
the data and can be derived as follows:
Let p denote the response rate, the number of responses in the current n subjects, x, 
follows a binomial distribution, Binomial (n, p).  Taking the B ayesian method and 
combining the prior distribution and the observed data x, the posterior distribution of the 
response rate follows a beta distribution, i.e.
In the following case, 30% is the target response rate.
p Beta (0.03 + x, 0.07 + n- x) with the posterior mean (0.03+ x)/(0.07 + n).
Futility  anal ysis for each disease cohort will begin when response data is available for at 
least 10 subjects. Each disease cohort may  be enrolled. With a sample size of 
approximately  40 subjects, the study  will have 90 % statistical power to test stopped earl y 
for futility  if the predictive probability  of success ( response rate ≥ historical response 
rate) is less than 1%.  Futility  stopping rules are defined for each cohort in Section 3.2.7.

11.2 Stopping Rule for Futility (Interim Analysis)
An interim anal ysis will be conducted for Part 2 of th is study  in order to assess futility  
after response data are available for the first 20 subjects based on the overall best 
response rate.  If 0 responses are observed, then Part 2 of trial will be terminated with no 
further enrolment.  
If at least 1 respo nse occurs then an additional 20 subjects with NMC may  be enrolled.   
Emerging safet y data will also be reviewed.  Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing 
basis and after the first 20 patients to ensure the safet y profile supports continued 
enrolment.  If there is sufficient sample size an exploratory  anal ysis will be undertaken to 
evaluate whether response rates differ between molecular subt ypes (e.g. NUT -BRD3, 
NUT -BRD4, NUT -variant).
There is a 1% probability of stopping for futility  under the alternat ive h ypothesis (i.e 
incorrectly  stopping at the interim when in drug is efficacious) and a 36% probability  of 
stopping for futility  under the null hy pothesis (i.e. correctly  stopping at the interim when 
the drug is not efficacious).
At final anal ysis, if > =5 responses are observed then we reject the null hy pothesis and 
accept the alternative h ypothesis that there is at least a 20% response rate in NMC 
following dosing with GSK525762.
Section 11.4.1 Primary  Analysis
Rationale for Change: The anal ysis section was updated to include additional tumor 
types in Part 2 now included with this protocol amendment.

365Revised Text
For Part 1, anti -tumor activities will be evaluated based on clinical evidence and response 
criteria. If the data warrant, the response data wi ll be summarized by  dose level.
The primary  aim of Part 2 is to demonstrate a clinically  meaningful response raterates in 
each of 20% relative to a 5% response rate suggesting no activity the disease cohorts 
separately . 
The overall Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects with a 
confirmed complete response ( who achieved CR) or a partial response ( PR) at any  time 
as per RECI ST 1.1 criteria. Subjects with unknown or missing response will be treated as 
non responders, i.e., these among subjects will be included in the denominator when 
calculating the percentage. Exact methods for calculated who received at least one dose of 
treatment. Overall response rate and the associated 2- sided 95% exact confidence 
intervals limits will be in the RAP. 
The number and t ypes of responses, as outlined in RECI ST 1.1, will be listed and 
summarized, as appropriate, for the NMC provided separately  for each disease cohort in 
Part 2.
NMC is an extremely  rare cancer and there is no known response to chemotherap y. This 
cancer has an extremely  poor survival rate of 6.7 months (median). Based on dialog 
between investigators and GSK, it is estimated that a RR of 20% would be the lowest 
threshold which is of clinical relevance. The study is based on the assumption that t he 
maximum response rate for an ineffective drug is 0.05 and the minimum response rate for 
an effective drug is 0.20. A futility  assessment will be conducted after data is available 
from the first 20 subjects. If 0 responses are observed among the 20 subje cts at interim, 
then in conjunction with a thorough review of additional data, that cohort may  be closed 
for further enrollment. If one or more subjects respond, then an additional 20 subjects 
may be enrolled to more accuratel y define the true response rat e.
At final anal ysis, if 5 responses are observed then the null hy pothesis will be rejected 
and the alternative h ypothesis that there is at least a 20% response rate in NMC following 
dosing with GSK525762 will be accepted .

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
Rationale for Change: After an internal QTc analy sis and evaluation of cardiac safet y 
data collected from all subjects up to the 100 mg QD cohort available by  May  15 2015, 
the 48- hour telemetry  requirement was removed for all parts of the study  and the 
frequency  of Holter Monitoring was decreased in Part 1. There was no GSK525762 
related QTc prolongation observed within the first 48 hours of treatment.Therefore the 
inpatient telemetry  on W1D1 and W1D2 was discontinued. Although the presence of a 
slight delay ed QT prolonging effect was noted, this did not lead to any  marked 
prolongation (no individual subjects with delta >60ms or QTc >500ms). The frequency  
of Holter monitoring in Part 1 was also reduced from 6 timepoints to 4 timepoints, as the 
ECG time -points currently  included in the required assessments provide adequate cardiac 
safet y assessments of any potential QT-prolonging effect (including potential delay ed 
effects). All Holter monitoring will continue to be reviewed at a central lab for 
arrhythmia assessment. The overnight stay s previously  mandated as part of the 48
-hour 
in-patient telemetry  will only  be required on serial ECG/PK day s at sites that are unable 
to collect after -hours PK timepoints as outpatient.

safet y monitoring will be required, consisting of at least 48 hours of telemetry  following 
the first dose (overnight stay s in research facility  necessary ), 24 hours of Holter 
monitoring at Screening and in Week 1, Week 2 , and Week 4 , and Week 9 , and triplicate
12-lead ECGs prior to dosing on selected day s and prior to drawing PK samples on serial 
PK sampling day s (overnight stay s in research facility  may  be necessary  in Part 1). ). 
Extensive laboratory  testing includes, in addition to standard hema tology , clinical 
chemistry , pancreatic, coagulation, and liver chemistry  panels, testing for troponin, c -
peptide, 1,5 AG, HBA1c, and thy roid monitoring. Additional safet y assessments may be 
necessary  if a combination treatment regimen is administered to ad dress specific safety  
concerns with the other agent(s) being administered.
Section 1.5 Risk A ssessment
Rationale for Change: The Telemetry  was removed from the Risk Assessment section 
after an internal QTc analy sis and evaluation of cardiac safet y data col lected from all 
subjects up to the 100 mg QD cohort available b y May 15 2015, the 48 -hour telemetry  
requirement was removed for all parts of the study  and the frequency  of Holter 
Monitoring was decreased in Part 1. There was no GSK525762 related QTc prolo ngation 
observed within the first 48 hours of treatment. Therefore the inpatient telemetry  on 
W1D1 and W1D2 was discontinued. Although the presence of a slight delayed QT 
prolonging effect was noted, this did not lead to any  marked prolongation (no individual 
subjects with delta >60ms or QTc >500ms). The frequency  of Holter monitoring in Part 
1 was also reduced from 6 timepoints to 4 timepoints, as the ECG time -points currentl y 
included in the required assessments provide adequate cardiac safet y assessment s of an y 
potential QT -prolonging effect (including potential delay ed effects). All Holter 
monitoring will continue to be reviewed at a central lab for arrh ythmia assessment. 
The Reproductive Risk section was also updated after new findings related to 
GSK5 25762 in a rat female fertility  study  in which adverse reproductive findings in 
pregnant rats (maternal and embry o-fetal) were observed. This section was updated with 
a summary  of those findings.

Cardio- vascular: (Paragraph 2)   
Given the ris
ks of long QTc associated arrh ythmias, and of compound associated 
cardiom yopath y, subjects will be monitored closely for changes in QTc with triplicate 
12-lead ECG, Holter monitoring, telemetry , and for elevations in plasma Troponin. 
Inpatient 48 -hour tele metry  was originall y required for all subjects following the first 
dose of study  drug, as part of the cardiac monitoring. Evaluation of cardiac safet y data 
from subjects treated up to the 100 mg QD cohort by  the cut -off date of May  15, 2015 
demonstrated n o significant QTc prolongation after single and repeat dose administration. 
Therefore, the 48 -hour telemetry  requirement was removed and the frequency  of Holter 
monitoring was reduced with Protocol Amendment 6.

Reproductive and Developmental :In 4-week toxi cology studies, bilateral sperm 
retention, germ cell degeneration and tubular vacuolization, and depletion of testicular 
germinal epithelium occurred in male dogs receiving ≥ 0.3 mg/kg and male rats receiving 
≥ 10 mg/kg doses of GSK525762.  Exposures assoc iated with reproductive toxicity  in 
male dogs overlap with the proposed 5 mg starting dose in this FTIH study .
Preliminary  rat embry o fetal development 
GSK525762 at 0, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day  (total dose; doses expressed as parent 
compound) was given or ally by gavage BID (doses given 6 hours apart) to pregnant rats 
on Day s 0 through 17 post -coitus. Dose- dependent maternal toxicity  (reduced body  
weight gain and reduced food consumption) was evident at ≥10 mg/kg/day . Embry o-fetal 
toxicity  was evident as bo
th pre -implantation loss and increased fetal resorptions leading 
to complete loss of litters at 30 mg/kg/day , and dose -dependent increased fetal 
resorptions at doses ≥1mg/kg/day . Developmental toxicity  was evident as decreased fetal 
weights at 10 mg/kg/da y and fetal malformations and/or variations at all doses 
(membranous ventricular septal defects in the heart ≥1 mg/kg/day ; great vessel, heart, 
kidney , ovary , uterus, and ureter malformations and/or variations at 10 mg/kg/day ). The 
AUC0 -t and Cmax at 1 mg/ kg/day  (the lowest dose tested) in non-mated female rats after 
5 doses were 54 ng.h/mL and 18 ng/mL, respectively .
No ovarian histologic changes were observed in the 4 week toxicology  studies, however 
female fertility  (disrupted estrous cy clicit y, delays t o mating and/or reduced fertility  
index) was affected in rats given 30 mg/kg/day  GSK525762 for 15 day s prior to mating 
and 15 day s prior to mating through to Day 6 post coitus (pc). Systemic exposure in rats 
was approximately  2-fold higher than current exposure in late stage cancer patients (at 60 
mg/day ).No fertility  effects were observed when 30 mg/kg/day  was given for 6 weeks 
followed b y 6 weeks off -dose prior to mating.
Reproductive and developmental toxicity  ( decreased fetal bod y weight, fetal 
malformations or variations and / or pre -and post -implantation loss) occurred in rats 
given GSK525762 ≥ 1mg/kg/day  from conception through gestation day  17 (of 21 day s)

370and when dosed at ≥10 mg/kg/day  for 14 day s and dosing stopped prior to mating or 
continue d until Day 6 pc. Systemic exposure in rats was approximately  80-fold lower 
than current exposure in late stage cancer patients (at 60 mg/day ).These results are 
consistent with observations that BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT have crucial roles in 
reproducti on and development [see the GSK 525762 IB [GlaxoSmithKline Document 
Number 2011N113741_03] for references.
Based on the findings in these reproductive and developmental toxicity  studies in rats 
with GSK525762, there is a substantiated risk for adverse effe cts on embryofetal 
development and impacts on female fertility .
In the BET11521 stud y, specific contraceptive guidelines and precautions for males and 
females are provided in the protocol.  In addition, the informed consent will include 
potential reproduct ive risks and precautions in addition to recommendations for the 
preservation of reproductive capacity .
Section 3.2.2. Dose Escalation and Schedule
Rationale for Change: The original staggered dosing schedule (1,3,5,7) was designed to 
include dosing breaks over the course of the first two weeks to monitor for any  potential 
immediate toxicities before moving into continuous daily  dosing in the third week. As 
included in the rationale for removal of 48 -hour telemetry  and reduction of holter 
monitoring frequen cy, after an internal QTc anal ysis and evaluation of cardiac safety data 
collected from all subjects up to the 100 mg QD cohort available by  May  15 2015, 
evidence of a slight delayed QT prolonging effect was noted, however this did not lead to 
any marked p rolongation and there were no individual subjects with delta >60ms or QTc 
>500ms. 
In an effort to achieve an optimal dosing schedule and further explore alternate dosing 
schedules (i.e.; two weeks of dosing, followed b y one week off stud y drug), the 
intermittent dosing was modified to allow subjects to begin continuous daily  dosing on 
Day 1. 
Revised Text:
A unique, staggered dosing schedule will be implemented to monitor for safet y (Table 4). 
This approach allows repeat dosing in a step -wise fashion to d etect changes in safet y, 
such as cardiotoxicity . Alternative dosing regimens and/or schedule may  be implemented 
based on emerging PK and safet y data.
In Part 1, subjects will follow the dose schedule outlined in Table 4. Alternative dosing 
regimens and/or schedule may  be implemented based on emerging PK and safet y 
data. Specifically , in Week 1 subjects will receive a single dose of study  drug on Day  1, 
rest on Day 2, receive study  drug on Day  3, Day  4, and Day  5, and rest again on Day  6 
and Day 7. In Week 2, subjects will receive study  drug on Day  1 through Day  5, and rest 
Day 6 and Day  7. From Week 3 the subject will start daily  dosing which will continue 
until study  completion.

ECGs, 48 -hour telemetry, and 24- hour Holter monitoring to be performed on the day s 
indicated in Table 4. 
Subjects will be evaluated for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 4 weeks of 
treatment (Section 3.2.3).
Table 4 Dosing Sched ule and Cardiac Monitoring for Part 1
Section 3.2.2.4. Alteration of Schedule
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to include a statement that PK 
sampling and other assessments may  be modified if alternate dosing schedules are 
explored to refle ct the new dosing schedule. This was to allow PK and/or other safet y 
assessments to be collected during dosing day s, and also to exempt subjects from having 
these assessments if they  fell on a non -dosing day  under a revised altered schedule.
Revised Text:
Alterations may  be made to the schedule of administration and/or PK/PD sampling 
schedule based on the results of emerging PK and safet y data.
Schedules that incorporate a recovery  period may  be explored (e.g. every  other day or 
two weeks on treatment followed by  one week off ). This approach will be considered if 
the safet y and PK data suggest that a therapeutic exposure cannot be achieved using the 
initial schedule without excessive toxicity . The starting dose for the alternate schedule 
will be the highest completed dose level (at or below MTD) with the initial schedule. 
Escalation can then proceed as described using 3 + 3 dose escalation.  If alternative 
dosing schedules are explored, PK sampling times and other safet y assessments may be 
modified to reflect the new dosing schedule.

Revised Text
Paragraph 1, Bullet point no 2 :
If no further subjects have been identified for a subsequent higher dose level and after a 
subject has completed 4 weeks of dosing on tha t regimen without a DLT, that subject 
may be escalated to the next higher dose level after an additional 4 weeks of dosing (total 
of 8 weeks of dosing), review of all safety  data and approval by  a GSK Medical Monitor. 
In this case the subject must follow t he staggered dosing /monitoring schedule for the first 
4-weeks as outlined in Table 4, as he/she will be the first subject exposed to the higher 
dose.

Paragraph 2 :
Subjects in the NMC PD Expansion Cohort will start with same staggere d dosing 
schedule during the first two weeks as described in Section 3.2.2 (Table 4); subjects will 
begin continuous dosing in Week 3 .  Extensive monitoring for cardiac safety  signals will 
be performed as required in Part 1, with triplicate 12- lead ECGs, 4 8-hour telemetry , and 
24-hour Holter monitoring to be performed on the day s indicated in Table 4.  All safet y 
and PK evaluations will be performed as outlined in the Time and Events Tables for Part

373Section 3.2.7. Part 2 Expansion Cohort
Rationale for Change:
Revised Text This section was up dated to clarify  that during the futility  assessment for 
individual cohorts in Part 2, if stopping criteria were met, further enrolment into that 
specific cohort would cease, but would not require stopping enrolment in other cohorts.
Paragraph 1 :
Approxima tely 150 subjects with NMC, SCL C, CRPC, TNBC and ER+BC will be 
enrolled in expansion cohort at the RP2D (appropriate to each age group) to gather more 
safet y data and to further assess anti -tumor activity .
Footnote for Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figu re 6:
The shaded regions are the specific regions for stopping the study enrollment for futility .
For instance, if there is no response in 10 subjects, then the predictive probability  for 
success will be 10% or less (the futility  criterion) and further en rollment the study into 
this cohort will be stopped.
Section 4.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
Rationale for Change: Based on emerging data from pre -clinical fetal and embry o 
toxicity  studies, the inclusion criteria specifying contraception requirements were update d 
to extend the length of time for contraception use for subjects. A summary of the findings 
from these preclinical studies may  be found in the body  of the protocol under 
Reproductive Risks in Section 1.5.
Revised Text
Inclusion criteria no 9, Bullet point no 2:
Child -bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods (described in 
Section 9.1) for an appropriate period of time (as determined b y the product label or 
investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently  minimize the ri sk of pregnancy  at 
that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at least 7 months 4 weeks 
after the last dose of study  medication.
Inclusion criteria no 10:
Male subjects must agree to use one of the methods of contraception specified. This 
method must be used from the time of the first dose of study  medication until least 16 
weeks after the last dose of study  medication. In addition, male subjects whose partners 
are or become pregnant while on study  medication must continue to use condo ms for 7 
days after stopping study medications.

382Section 6.4.4. Echocardiogram (ECHO)
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to clarify  that GSK is receiving all
ECHOs, not just those with a >10% LVEF decrease from baseline. 
Revised Text:
For all subjects, ECHOs will be performed at screening and at assessment times as 
outlined in Section 5. ECHOs should b e evaluated and compared to baseline by the same 
reader. Copies of all ECHO scans performed on subjects who experience an absolute 
decrease >10% in LVEF compared to baseline concurrent with LVEF < LLN will be 
required b y GSK for review. 
ECHO data may  willbe transferred and reviewed by  an independent cardiologist. 
Instructions for submission of qualify ing ECHO scans are provided in the SPM.
Section 6.4.6. Holter Monitoring
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to reflect the actual analy sis of the
Holter Monitoring at the central cardiac monitoring lab and clarify  that ECGs are not 
being extracted from the 24- hour holter; however arrh ythmia assessments will continue at 
the central cardiac monitoring lab for the holter monitoring.
Revised Text
Paragraph 3, 4 and 5 :
Analy sis of intervals and morphology  from the continuous digital ECG data will be 
acquired and stored electronically
 and manuall y over -read b y an external central 
validated ECG laboratory . Around each of the designated time points, 3 ECGs will be 
selected approximately  2 minutes apart. In order to increase consistency  of ECG 
interpretation, a limited number of central ECG over -readers will be used throughout the 
study . All ECGs for a given subject will be over -read by  the same reader from t he central 
validated ECG laboratory. The central reader will be blinded to subject identifiers (e.g., 
subject number, age, and sex), treatment assignment, and study  day when Holter ECGs 
data were was collected. The final intervals and morphology  anal yses entered into the 
database will be those generated b y the central ECG laboratory.
Baseline QT/QTcF values will be determined on Study  Day  -1 using time matched ECGs 
obtained from the Holter monitor at approximately  the same time points as planned for: 
Week 1 Day 1 to 2; Week 2 Day  3 to 4, Week 3 Day  5 to 6 and Week 4 Day  7 to Week 5 
Day 1. The mean from triplicate ECGs will be evaluated at each time point. For a given 
time point, the mean QTcF from 3 separate beats should be anal yzed on each ECG. 
Analy sis of Lead II will be conducted with V5 as back -up and one of the remaining 
precordial leads as an alternative when T waves are not well defined in Leads II or V5. 
QTcF for an individual beat will be calculated from the preceding RR interval since using 
the aver age heart rate (RR) intervals from the ECG could result in inaccurate QTcF 
calculations due to beat to beat variations in the RR intervals. 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET11 5521
383QT values should not be reported when the rh ythm is other than sinus rhy thm (sinus 
rhythm with normal respiratory  variation is acceptable), and in intraventricular 
conduction delay s (IVCD, QRS >120 msec). The other ECG information (including the 
rhythm and presence of IVCD) should be reported. The choice of the 3 consecutive beats 
to be measured should avoid ectopic be ats and the first beat after an ectopic beat. If 
IVCD occur, these should be reported. 
Section 6.4.7. Telemetry
Rationale for Change: The rationale for removing the 48 -hour telemetry  is explained 
above and all sections containing language around the origi nal telemetry  requirements 
were updated throughout the protocol.
Revised Text
In Part 1 As part of the original cardiac monitoring plan, and to complement real -time 
ECG assessments, monitoring for potential adverse arrh ythmias will be wasconducted 
utilizing continuous telemetry  monitoring. as outlined in the Time and Events Tables for 
at least 48 hours from the start of dose. If clinically  indicated, telemetry  may  be extended 
past 48 hours. Participating sites will have trained staff capable of monitoring an d 
responding in real time to any  potential cardiac adverse event detected by  telemetry . In 
addition, emergency  resuscitation equipment including appropriate pharmacological 
agents will also be immediately  accessible throughout the study . 
At the end of Par t 1, an analy sis of data collected on the QT interval up to, and including, 
the MTD expansion will be carried out. If the analysis b y the GSK Cardiac Safety Panel 
of internal and external experts indicates that telemetry  is no longer required for 
monitorin g the QT interval, then the study can progress to the next stage without 
telemetry . After internal QTc anal ysis and evaluation of cardiac safet y data collected 
from subjects up to the 100 mg QD cohort b y the cut -off date of May  15, 2015, The GSK 
Cardiac Sa fety Panel approved the removal of the 48 -hour telemetry  requirement was 
removed from all parts of the study in Protocol Amendment 6.
Removal of the telemetry requirement will be convey ed to the sites in the first 
instance through a separate document (or “ note to file”) that will note -i) a summary  of 
the anal ysis, and ii) the decision to proceed without telemetry  monitoring in the next 
stage of this study . This will allow the sites to submit the necessary  documentation to the 
IECs/IRBs for approval and to start the next stage of this study without telemetry . 
However, this process will be permitted only  if there are no other cardiac monitoring 
changes to be implemented. If additional cardiac monitoring changes are required, a 
protocol amendment will be nece ssary  before the next stage of the study  can start.

Section 8.2.2. Potential Drug Interactions with GSK525762
Rationale for Change: This section was updated with emerging metabolite data from the 
ongoing clinical studies with GSK525762.
Revised Text
Paragraph 1 :
The precise in vivo metabolic liability  for GSK525762 has y et to be assessed. In vitro 
data suggests that GSK525762 is only  metabolized by  CYP3A4 and thus 
coadministration of inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided during the 
course of the stud y where possible as they  may  respectively  decrease or increase 
exposure to GSK525762. has a negligible turnover and GSK525762 has low potential to 
inhibit the major human CYP i soforms (I C50’s ≥ 33 µM) or major transporters. There is
with no evidence for time dependent inhibition of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4. These results 
suggest a low risk for therapeutic drug interactions although inducers and inhibitors of 
both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 shoul d be avoided during the course of the study  where 
possible. Potential interactions with other Cy tochrome P450 metabolized drugs or effects 
on transporters have not been assessed.
Section 8.3. Prohibited Medications

Revised Text
Paragraph 1 :
Female subjects of childbearing potential must not become pregnant during the trial and 
for 7 months after stopping stud y medication and so must be sexually  inactive by  
abstinence or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1%.
Paragraph 3 :

389Section 9.2. Male Subjects
Rationale for Change: The additional guidance for condom use specific to males with a 
pregnant partner were in cluded as there is not y et sufficient evidence to rule out the 
potential of 762 being transferred to a developing embry o or fetus via the semen.
Added Text:
In addition, male subjects whose partners are or become pregnant while on study  
medication must con tinue to use condoms for 7 day s after stopping study  medications.
Section 11.6.1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters
Rationale for Change: A minor change was made to this section to correct a previous 
error.
Revised Text
Paragraph 2 :
From the plasma concentration -time data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters will 
be determined, as data permit: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to 
Cmax (tmax), area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC(0-t) and AUC(0- ∞) 
Week1 Day 1 onl y) and apparent t erminal phase half -life (t½). Trough concentration (C ) 
samples collected on the specified day s will be used to assess attainment of steady  state. 
To estimate the extent of accumulation after repeat dosing, the observed accumulation 
ratio (Ro) may  be deter mined. The ratio of AUC(0 -) on Week 3 / AUC(0- ∞)on Week 1
AUC(0 -) / Week 1 AUC(0 -)will be calculated to assess time invariance. GSK525762 
concentrations will be determined in urine samples to determine urinary  recovery  of 
unchanged drug and renal clearance.

DATA ANALYSIS : Subject demographic and sa fety data will be collected on electronic 
case report forms (eCRFs). All data will be pooled and descriptive safet y analyses 
summarized and listed by  cohort at study conclusion of Part 2 expansion cohorts . 
Additional analy ses may  occur between Part 1 and P art 2 and details will be included in 
the Reporting Anal ysis Plan (RAP). Part 2 of the study  is powered to test overall 
Response Rate (RR). A futility  assessment will be conducted after data are available from 
the first 10 subjects in each expansion cohort in Part 2.
Section 1.3.1. Human Pharmacokinetics
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to include reference to the latest 
Investigator Brochure, rather than include a summary  of the pharmacokinetic data 
collected to date in this section, as study is ongoing and data is continuously  emerging .
Revised Text:
Second paragraph
As of 06 -February -2015, the pharmacokinetics of GSK525762 has been evaluated in 23 
subjects following single and repeated dail y administration of 2 mg to 60 mg of 
GSK525762 in th e BET115521 trial. The summary statistics of the preliminary  PK 
parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 after single and repeat daily  oral 
administration, respectively .Information on the pharmacokinetics of GSK525762 in 
humans can be found in the Investigator’s B rochure ( 2011N113741_04) . In summary ,
GSK525762 pharmacokinetics are characterized by a rapid absorption with maximum 
concentration occurring mostly  within the first hour after dosing. GSK525762 is 
eliminated rapidly  with an average termin al phase half -life of 3 to 7 hours, leading to a 
lack of accumulation following once daily oral administration. Following single oral 
administration and repeated once daily administration of 2 mg to 60100 mg of 
GSK525762, Maximum observed concentrations ( Cmax)and Area under concentration-
time curve (AUC )tended to increase in a dose proportional fashion with a large full
overlap for individual AUC between 30 , 60, 80 and 100 and 60 mg cohorts.

Section 3.2.2.2. 3+3 Dose Escalation in Part 1
Rationale for Change: Minor grammatical error corrected in this section.
Revised Text:
Second paragraph
Once the MTD is reached, up to 12 additional subjects may be enrolled at the MTD to 
further evaluat e safet y and tumor PD. Up to an additional 6 subjects may  be enrolled at 
any dose level below the MTD in toorder to obtain additional dose/response information 
related to tumor PD.  Additional cohorts (with daily  exposure not exceeding QD MTD 
exposure) may also be initiated to explore alternative dosing schedules to optimize the 
PK, safet y and tolerability profile (see Section 3.2.2.4).  The enrolment of additional 
subjects as described could be in parallel with Part 2 enrolment.

393Section 3.2.2.4. Alteration of Schedule
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to include the final dose and regimen 
for Part 2 and to allow for the introduction of the besy late tablets to Part 1 subjects based 
on emerging data from Part 1 and Bes ylate Sub- Study.
Revised Text:
New text added after second paragraph:
On completion of the besylate sub -study  for relative bioavailabilty  of bes ylate 
formulation in tablet form, and having determined a dose for Part 2, all subjects in Part 1 
daily  dosing cohorts and in Part 2 will b e administered the bes ylate tablets at the 
recommended Part 2 dose of 75 mg once daily . Those subjects in Part 1 daily  dosing 
cohort who were on amorphous tablet dosing before availabilit y of bes ylate tablets, they  
will be switched to the equivalent besy late tablet dose and will have limited PK samples 
drawn after start on bes ylate tablets.
In Part 2, subjects approved to alter their current dose level with either a dose reduction 
or dose escalation may  require additional limited PK sampling (pre -dose, 0.5, and 3 
hours) at the new dose level, after 4 -7 day s at the adjusted dose level.
Section 3.2.2.6. Intra -Subject Dose Escalation
Rationale for Change: Minor clarification made in this section to clarify  intra -subject 
dose escalation was relevant to Part 1 su bjects only.
Revised Text:
Second paragraph
In Part 1, Subjects approved for intra -subject dose escalation will require additional 
limited PK sampling (pre -dose, 0.5, 3 and 6 -8 hours) at the higher dose, as determined by  
GSK Clinical Pharmacology .  Additional safet y assessments such as insulin/glucose or 
cardiac monitoring may  be specified at the time of dose escalation or schedule 
modification based on the safet y profile in previous subjects at the higher dose level. 
Intra -subject dose escalations or schedule modification will be discussed with 
investigators and approved by  the GSK Medical Monitor and safet y monitoring required 
will be specified in writing.

Additional text added to further clarify  statistical design and observed response data that 
will guide futility  assessments and further enrolment decisions for e ach expansion cohort 
in Part 2.
Revised Text:
First and second paragraph
Based on the anal ysis and evaluation of the safet y profile and available 
pharmacod ynamic, pharmacokinetic and efficacy data generated from all subjects 
enrolled in Part 1 as of Januar y 28, 2016, including the anal ysis of subjects enrolled in the 
Besylate Sub- Study , the final dose and regimen for Part 2 is determined to be 75 mg once 
daily . The bes ylate salt tablets will be the formulation used for subjects enrolled in Part 2 
(and potentially  for ongoing or newl y enrolled subjects in Part 1). Additional details and 
supporting information are provided under separate cover in a companion document and 
dose decision memo. Approximately  150 subjects with NMC, SCL C, CRPC, TNBC and 
ER+BC will b e enrolled in expansion cohort at the RP2D to gather more safety  data and 
to further assess anti -tumor activity . 
Subjects in Part 2 will start with a continuous daily dosing schedule unless safet y, PK or 
PD data necessitate a different dosing schedule. The final dose and regimen for Part 2 
will be decided upon completion of dose escalation in Part 1.

Section 4.1. Number of Subjects
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to increase the total number of subjects 
tobe enrolled in the Part 1 based on actual recruitment.
Revised Text:
First paragraph :
The number of dose levels and the level at which the MTD will be reached cannot be 
determined in advance. An adequate number of subjects will be enrolled into the study  to 
establish a recommended dose(s) and schedule(s) of GSK525762 for further study . To 
complete Part 1, it is estimated
3060to 6090evaluable subjects will be enrolled. The 
besylate sub -study  will enroll approximately  10 to 12 evaluable subjects in the Uni ted 
States only .  Part 2 will enroll approximately  150 subjects.

4.2.3.2. Subject and Study Completion
A subject will be considered to have completed the study  2 years after the last treatment 
or if the subject dies or is still in follow -up at the time the study is closed or terminated, 
whichever is sooner. Document the cause of death in the CRF. A subject will be 
considered to have withdrawn from the study  if the subject has not died and is lost to 
follow -up, has withdrawn consent, or at the investigator’s discretion is no longer being 
followed.
In Part 1, a subject will be considered to have completed the study  if:
they complete screening assessments, the 28- day DLT observation period, and the 
end-of-treatment follow -up visit,
they progress or die while receiving stud y treatment, or
are receiving ongoing study  treatment at the time of th e Sponsor’s decision to 
close the study .
In Part 2, a subject will be considered to have completed the study  if:
they progressed or die while receiving study  treatment, or
are receiving ongoing study  treatment at the time of the Sponsor’s decision to 
close the study .
Subjects who have not died, and are no longer being followed for survival are considered 
to have discontinued the study.  The End of Study eCRF should only  be completed when 
a subject is no longer being followed.  The stud y may be considered co mpleted for 
purposes of a final anal ysis when 70% of subjects enrolled at part 2 have progressed or 
died.  If available, subjects continuing on treatment at the time of final analysis may  be 
offered the option to continue in a rollover trial.

First and second paragraph:
During the dose escalation phase in Part 118F-FDG PET assessments will be optional 
until the standard 3+3 design is implemented. At this point, the sites will be required to 
perform 18F-FDG PET assessments for all NMC subject s and other solid tumors as 
appropriate.
At selected sites, subjects 18F-FDG PET avid tumors are eligible for pre -dose and post -
dose (baseline and on treatment) 18F-FDG PET assessments. The initial assessment 
should be performed as close to Tmax as possibl e and pharmacokinetics sampling will be 
performed as outlined in Time and Events Table to pair with 18F-FDG PET assessments. 
Additional scans may  be performed at different timepoints based on emerging data during 
the study . 
During Part 2 PET (FDG or fluor ide) scans should be performed at baseline, with follow 
up scans conducted as clinically  appropriate (as outlined in the T&E Table 16).
Section 6.8.1. Tumor Tissue Collection
Rationale for Change: Further clarification added to this section to the requirem ents for 
tumor tissue collection in Part 1 and Part 2.
Language was also included to allow for theintroduction of a pre -screen consent to 
subjects in order to facilitate collection of tumor tissue. 
Revised Text:
First paragraph :
NMC patients in Part 1 will be required to submit a fresh or archival tumor specimen for 
diagnosis or retrospective diagnostic confirmation.  NMC patients in Part 2 will be 
required to submit a fresh or archival tumor specimen to the central laboratory  during the 
14 day  screening period for diagnosis. Due to the timely  need to determine NMC status 
by NUT IHC testing, a pre -screen informed consent may  be offered to expedite obtaining 
the archival tissue in Part 2. These specimens may also be evaluated retrospectivel y for 
exploratory research as described above. 
Third Paragraph :
During the accelerated dose escalation phase (Part 1), fresh pre -and post -dose biopsy  
collections will be optional until the standard 3+3 design is implemented.  During the 3+3 
dose escalation phase in Part 1, and during Part 2, pre-and post -treatment biopsies 
collected between W2D1 – W3D1 (4- 6 hrs post -dose) are mandatory . For subjects in Part 
1and 2, if tumor tissue is not accessible, discussion with the GSK medical monitor is 
required.

408Section 6.8.2.2. Systemic (Unstimulated) Plasma for Cy tokines, 
Chemokines, and A cute Phase Proteins
Rationale for Change: A minor correction was made to the list of possible anal ytes 
being measured in plasma samples to change MI P1-α to MI P1-β.
Revised Text:
The set of anal ytes identical to that used in the whole blood ex vivo assay  (including for 
example, MCP -1, MI P1-βα, IL-8) will also be measured in plasma samples taken during 
PK sampling and at the time of an y Grade 2 fever or sy mptoms of a cy tokine storm. This 
will asse ss sy stemic inflammatory  response in the subject using biomarkers such as pro-
inflammatory  cytokines and acute phase proteins and correlate the s ystemic response to 
drug with that in stimulated and unstimulated blood. These biomarkers are expected to 
chang e over day s rather than hours, based on the plasma half lives and pre -clinical data, 
such that sampling will also be performed after repeat dosing.
Section 7.1. GSK525762 Investigational Product Dosage/A dministration
Rationale for Change: This section was updated following results from the bes ylate sub-
study , showing the bes ylate salt coated tablet is bioequivalent to the amorphous free -base 
uncoated tablet. In addition there is a lack of effect of a high -fat high- calorie breakfast on 
the overall exposure ( i.e. AUC) to GSK525762 administered as bes ylate coated tablets 
while administration with food tended to slightl y decrease Cmax. The fasting requirement 
is thus no longer necessary  in subjects taking the besy late formulation in Part 2.
Therefore, language was added to allow for the introduction of the bes ylate tablets to Part 
1 subjects. The dose administration section was also updated to allow study drug to be 
taken an y time of day as long as taken at the same time each day  (Part 1 and Part 2) and 
to be ta ken with or without food (Part 2 subjects only ).
Revised Text:
First paragraph:
GSK525762 Tablets will be provided to sites by GSK. The contents of the label will be in 
accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements. An amorphous, free -base 
formula tion of GSK525762 will be used in Part 1 ( Table 23) and a cry stalline, bes ylate 
formulation ( Table 24) will be introduced in the besy late sub -study  in Part 1 (US sites 
only) and the Part 2 expansion cohorts. After completion of the bes ylate sub -study  and 
introduction of besy late material for Part 2, remaining subjects ongoing in Part 1 may  be 
required to change from the amorphous free -base formulation to the besy late formulation 
(at the equivalent dose) based on the amorphous supply  availability .

Section 7.2. Handling and Storage of Study  Treatment
Rationale for Change: Updated storage requirements were included in this section for 
the besy late tablets.
Revised Text:
Third and fourth paragraph:
GSK525762 Amorphous Free -base Tablets are to be stored at up to 30°C (86°F) and 
protected from light and moisture.
GSK525762 Bes ylate Tablets are to be stored at up to 30°C (86°F) and protected from

Section 7.3. Meals and Di etary  Restrictions
Rationale for Change:  This section was updated based on the results of the bes ylate 
sub-study  showing a lack of effect of a high -fat high- calorie breakfast on the overall 
exposure (i.e. AUC) to GSK525762 administered as bes ylate coated tablets, to clarify  
thatthe fasting requirement is being lifted in Part 2; however, on Serial PK sampling day s
in Part 2 (Week 1 and Week 4) s ubjects will still be required to fast overnight (i.e., at 
least 8 hours) . 
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
410Revised Text:
First three paragraph:
Subjects During Part 1 subjects will fast for at least one hour prior to each dose of study  
drug. After dosing, subjects will be asked to fast for an additional two hours.  These 
fasting requirements have been implemented in the protocol and informed conse nts to 
minimize pharmacokinetic variability . During Besy lteBesylateSub-Study , subjects will 
be asked to fast overnight (at least 8 hours) and continue fasting for 4 hours post dose 
administration except for the fed administration where subject will be req uested to ingest 
a high -fat high- calorie meal within 30 minutes prior to administration ( FDA , 2002). 
If a subject vomits after taking stud y drug, the subject should be instructed not to retake 
the dose and should take the next scheduled dose. Requirements for fasting before and 
after dosing may  be modified based on emerging pharmacokinetic, pharmacody namic, 
and safet y data. An y change in fasting requirements will be communicated to each 
investigator and site staff in future protocol amendment. Should a twi ce daily regimen be 
required, additional consideration will be paid to this requirement fasting requirements
once the escalation period is past.
In Part 2 based on the results of the besy late sub -study  showing a lack of effect of a high-
fat high -calorie br eakfast on the overall exposure (i.e. AUC) to GSK525762 administered 
as bes ylate coated tablets, the fasting requirement is being lifted , except on Serial PK 
sampling day s in Part 2 (Week 1 and Week 4). On these days, subjects should fast 
overnight (i.e., at least 8 hours). After dosing, subjects will be asked to fast for an 
additional two hours. These fasting requirements have been implemented in the protocol 
and informed consents to minimize PK variability .

411Section 8.2.2. Potential Drug Interactions with GSK525762
Rationale for Change: This DDI section was updated based on emerging metabolite 
data.
Revised Text:
The precise in vivo metabolic liability  for GSK525762 has y et to be assessed. In vitro 
data suggests that GSK525762 is only  metabolized by  CYP3A4 and thus 
coadministration of inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided during the 
course of the stud y where possible as they  may  respectively  decrease or incre ase 
exposure to GSK525762. GSK525762 has low potential to inhibit the major human CYP 
isoforms (I C50’s ≥ 33 µM) or major transporters. There is no evidence for time 
dependent inhibition of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4. GSK525762 is considered to have a low 
risk of causing clinicall y relevant perpetrator drug interactions with CYP3A4, CYP2B6 
and CYP2C8 enzy mes and/or PgP, BCRP, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2 -
K, BSEP or MRP2 transporters either via direct or metabolism- dependent inhibition.
GSK525762 was shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3 in vitro, however, the 
clinical impact of this inhibition is only  deemed a concern for sensitive substrates of 
OATP1B1 or OAT3 (e.g. methotrexate).
Potential interactions with other Cy tochrome P450 metabolized drugs have no t been 
assessed.

Objective & Endpoint
Primary  endpoint, Point 2
Rationale for Change: Include PSA50 criteria and GI ST endpoints with addition of 
GIST cohort .
Revised Text:
 Assess overall resp onse rate (RR) using byRECIST 1.1 in NMC and other solid tumors or 
PSA50 response rate using PCWG2 guidelines in CRPC or DCR (CR+PR+ SD ≥ 16 weeks 
in duration) in GIST.
Primary  Hypothesis
Rationale for Change: Include GIST information with addition of GI ST cohort.
Revised Text:
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): this will be determined by testing the null hypothesis that the 
disease control rate is ≤15%, with about 80%  power when the true disease control rate is 40%.
SUBJECT SA MPLE :
Rationale for Cha nge: Update number of subjects to allow for additional subjects to be 
enrolled in Part 1 at the MTD and the addition of the GI ST cohort in Part 2.

SAFETY ME ASUREMENTS: 
Rationale for Change: After an internal evaluation of cardiac safet y data collected from 
all subjects available b y 20Dec 2016, the Holter Monitoring was removed, as the ECG 
time-points currentl y included in the required assessments provide adequate cardiac 
safet y assessments of any potential QT -prolonging effect (including potential delay ed 
effects).
Revised Text:
Routine phy sical examinations, vital sign measurements, echocardiograms, and 
monitoring of adverse events. Cardiac safet y monitoring will be required, consisting of 
24 hours of Holter monitoring at Screening and in Week 1 and Week 4, and triplicate 12-

Rationale for Change: Addition of GI ST cohort and rational to support using a BET 
inhibitor in this tumor ty pe. 
Revised Text:
First paragraph first sentence :
acute leukemias, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GI ST), and other N -Myc driven tumors.
Second paragraph
Based on the preclinical findings within GSK and with col laborators , subjects with small 
cell lung cancer, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, castration 
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor 
positive (ER positive) breast cancer, neuroblastom a, and N -Myc amplified solid tumors 
will be enrolled to the dose finding part of the study . In addition, Part 2 expansion cohorts 
will enrol subjects with NMC, SCL C, CRPC, TNBC, ER+BC and GIST.
Last Paragraph, GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor) point added
GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor)
The super -enhancer profiling of sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines identified 
conserved super -enhancer program in GIST tumors. Some of the genes associated with 
super -enhancers in GIST tumors include well -establi shed drivers, such as KITand 
PDGFRA, but also potential novel targets, such as ETV1 and HAND1. GIST -specific KIT
super -enhancer regulating KITgene activity  is remarkabl y sensitive to bromodomain 
inhibition. KIT -dependent GI ST cell lines have an IC50 to t he protot ypical bromodomain 
inhibitor, JQ1, ranging from 150 –470nM (Matthew Hemming, personal communication, 
December 2016). Other bromodomain inhibitors, including GSK525762, demonstrate 
similar selective toxicity  in KI T-dependent GIST cell lines. At th e gene and protein 
expression levels, BET bromodomain inhibitors attenuate the expression of genes, 
associated with superenhancers, such as KIT, ETV1 and HAND1, suggesting that BET 
proteins are required for the maintenance of GI ST super -enhancer associated
transcriptional program and are critical regulators of GI ST growth and survival. I n 
support of this mechanism, uncoupling KITexpression from its native super- enhancer 
leads to resistance to bromodomain inhibition. I n KIT -dependent GIST cells, 
bromodomain inhibition shows synergistic toxicity  with KIT -inhibition, further

Hemming, personal communication, December 2016). These evolving data have driven

431Secondparagrap h first sentence
Given the poor prognosis and high unmet medical need of NMC, as well as in other 
tumor ty pes such as relapsed/refractory  SCL C, NSCL C,CRC, CRPC, TN and ER+ BC, 
GIST,NB and N-Myc amplified tumors and the exceptional drug- to-target alignme nt of 
GSK525762, a combined Phase I/II stud y (BET115521) is proposed.
Third paragraph first sentence 
The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of GSK525762 with possible adjustment based 
on the relative bioavailability  of the bes ylate salt formulation, will be studied in the 
cohort expansion (Part 2) to determine efficacy , safety  and tolerability  in NMC 
patients and other tumor ty pes including SCL C, CRPC, TNBC, ER+BC and GI ST.
Section 1.5. Risk A ssessment
Rationale for Change: Risk assessment section changed to be in line with changes 
throughout the protocol (e.g. removal of Holter monitoring, will no longer collect 
cytokines in event of fever) and updated section with most current pre -clinical data.

Gastrointestinal: Second and Third Sentence
Micr oscopic examination included degenerative changes in the esophagus, stomach, 
small and large intestine, including erosion or ulceration, mucosal congestion, 
hemorrhage and edema, cry pt dilatation and focal inflammatory  cell infiltration in the 28
daytoxico logy studies of up to 3 month duration yin the dog and rat. Recovery  was 
evident after a minimum of 3 weeks off dose. 
Cardio -vascular:  
First Paragraph first sentence
Although there were minimal effects of GSK525762 on current density  and no effects on
trafficking in HEK -293 cells or on ECG rhy thms or arrhy thmias in the ex vivo rabbit 
wedge assay , QT and QTc prolongation (maximum 41 milliseconds at 3 mg/kg for 12 
days) was seen in dogs after a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg or repeat dosing at 
1mg/kg/da yin 4 week toxicology  studies of up to 3 month duration.   
First Paragraph fourth sentence
Increases in biomarkers of cardiac damage (cardiac troponin I and T, m yosin light chain
and NT- proANP ) were also seen in the rat and cardiac troponin I in th e dog. 
Second Paragraph first sentence
Given the risks of long QTc associated arrh ythmias, and of compound associated 
cardiom yopath y, subjects will be monitored closely for changes in QTc with triplicate 
12-lead ECG , Holter monitoring, and for elevations in plas ma Troponin.

First Paragraph second sentence
The mean from triplicate ECGs (when indicated) will be evaluated at each time point.
Subpoint  Serum Markers 
Holter Monitoring and Serum Markers 
Heading of subsection and first sentence
In addition to the Safet y ECGs performed during the study , continuous 12 -lead Digital 
Holter ECGs will be acquired at baseline and at selected time points during therap y for 
accurate retrospective analy sis of QTcF variation.  L aboratory laboratory evaluations f or 
cardiac troponins and electroly tes will be performed and NT- pro-brain natriuretic peptide 
(BNP) will be checked at baseline, regular intervals (as specified in the Time and E vents
table sof the protocol), and when clinicall y warranted during the stud y treatment.  
Hematologic and lymphoid:  
First Two Sentence
Lym phoid toxicity  was observed in rats and dogs manifested by  bone marrow hy po-
cellularity  and variable and inconsistent changes in decreased total white cell ly mphocy te 
and decreased platelet coun ts.  There were variable and inconsistent changes in multiple
red blood cell parameters sand reticulocy tes in the periphery , and decreased organ 
weight, th ymus, spleen, and ly mph node h ypocellularity.  
Deleted text 
Cytokines: In vitro incubation of human whole blood for 24 hours with GSK525762 
resulted in a time and concentration -dependent induction of IL -1β.  The maximum effect 
was variable between donors (34 to 3986 pg/mL, mean 1238 pg/mL  from 16 donors); 
however, the concentration required to drive this effect was consistent across the donors 
(pEC50 6.0, 0.42ug/mL).  This effect was not o bserved in whole blood from other species 
(rat and dog) or in preparations of human PBMCs or neutrophils.  Special note is made 
for the occurrence of fever which could be s ymptomatic of cy tokine level elevation 
during dosing of the compound (see protocol S ection 7.7, Table 23“Fever”), and close 
monitoring of cy tokine levels will be instigated at this point.
Pulmonary: 
First paragraph first sentence

BET115521
433Aggregates of foam y macrophages in peri -bronchiolar areas were evident in rats given 
≥10 mg/kg/day for 28 day s.
First paragraph fourth sentence
This finding is unlikely  to affect pulmonary  function; no effects were observed in the 3 
month studies in rats and dogs. however the effect of dosing beyond 4 weeks is unknown. 
Hepatic Toxicity : 
Non-adverse liver changes were observed in rats and dogs including increases in bilirubin 
levels and transient increases in AST in rats. Necrosis was observed in one rat a t 30 
mg/kg/day  in the 4 week study . GSK525762 has been demonstrated to undergo 
bioactivation in vitro which indicates potential for idiosy ncratic heptotoxicity . The 
precursor metabolite has been observed in clinical plasma samples.
The BET115521 protocol i ncludes frequent monitoring of liver biochemistry  along with 
stopping criteria for dose limiting toxicity  (DLT), liver monitoring guidelines and 
management (see Section 3.2.3, Section 7.7.2, and Appendix 3).
Reproductive and Developmental:
First Paragraph first sentence
In 4-week toxicology  studies of up to 3 month duration , bilateral sperm retention, germ 
cell degeneration and tubular vacuolization, and depletion of testicular germinal 
epithelium occurred in male dogs receiving ≥ 0.3 01mg/kg and male rats receiving ≥ 10 
mg/kg doses of GSK525762.  Exposures associated with reproductive toxicity  in male 
dogs overlap with the proposed 5 mg starting dose in this FTIH study .
First Paragraph third sentence
These changes were accompanied in rats and dogs by  changes in sperm morphology , 
motility  and number and hormonal changes (decreased testosterone and Inhibin B in rats 
and increased FSH in rats and dogs).  Reduced prostate weight and secretory  content was 
also evident in the rat.  An effect on spermatogenesis is anticipated. Full or partial 
reversibility  of the testicular effects was observed in the 3 month rat and dogs studies 
following a 17 week off dose period .

avoid confusion of required tests.
Deleted Text :
Section 6.4.6. Holter Monitoring
Digital Holter ECG data will be obtained from 12 -lead continuous Holter monitoring 
device supplied b y the Sponsor. ECG acquisition via the Holter monitoring device will be 
performed at planned time points indicated in the Time and Events and should be 
obtained prior to phlebotomy  and vital sign time points. Collection of critical ECG data 
shortly  after meals or during sleep should be avoided since QT prolongation occurs at 
these times and a change in the QT -RR relationship occurs during sleep. Meals should be 
administered according to the guidelines provided in Section 7.3 and in the SPM as meal 
and snack times will need to be adjusted accordingl y on dosing and ECG sampling days. 
Analy sis of intervals and morphology  from t he continuous digital ECG data will be 
acquired and stored electronically and manuall y over -read b y an external central 
validated ECG laboratory . In order to increase consistency  of ECG interpretation, a 
limited number of central ECG over -readers will be u sed throughout the study . All ECGs 
for a given subject will be over -read b y the same reader from the central validated ECG 
laboratory . The central reader will be blinded to subject identifiers (e.g., subject number, 
age, and sex), treatment assignment, and study  day when Holter data was collected. The 
final intervals and morphology  analy ses entered into the database will be those generated 
by the central ECG laboratory . 
6.4.7. Telemetry
As part of the original cardiac monitoring plan, and to complement rea l-time ECG 
assessments, monitoring for potential adverse arrhy thmias was conducted utilizing 
continuous telemetry  monitoring. In addition, emergency  resuscitation equipment 
including appropriate pharmacological agents will also be immediately  accessible 
throughout the stud y.

First paragraph
Urine samples for quantitative anal ysis of GSK525762 will may be collected at pre -dose 
and over a dosing interval immediately  following dosing on Week 1 Day  1 and in Week 
3at the time points noted in the Time and Events Tables for Part 1 of the study  (these 
samples are optional as of Amendment 9). Urine samples will be collected in subjects in
Part 1 (with the exclusion of bes ylate sub -study ) once the 3+3 dose escalation has been 
reached. Additional sampling may  be instituted based on emerging data.  
Section 6.8.1. Tumor Tissue Collection
Rationale for Change: Removal of 14 day  window for collection of tissue for NMC 
subjects in Part 2 for the diagnostic testing. Pre -screen consents will be allowed for 
archival or fresh tissue biopsy  in Part 2 NMC subjects. Addition of language regarding 
the required laboratory  values prior to post -dose biopsy .
Revised Text:
First paragraph second and third sentence
NMC patients in Part 2 will be required to submit a fresh or archival tumor specimen to 
the central laboratory  during the 14 day  screening period for diagnosis. Due to the timely  
need to determine NM C status by  NUT IHC testing, a pre -screen informed consent may  
be offered to expedite obtaining the archival tissue in Part 2.
Third paragraph onwards
During the accelerated dose escalation phase (Part 1), fresh pre -and post -dose biopsy  
collections will b e optional until the standard 3+3 design is implemented.  During the 3+3 
dose escalation phase in Part 1, and during Part 2, pre- and post -treatment biopsies are 
collected as outlined in collected between W2D1 –W3D1 (4 -6 hrs post -dose) the Time 
and Events Tables and are mandatory . Archival tissue may  be accepted as a pre -treatment 
specimen if the subject is treatment naïve. For subjects in Part 1 and 2, if tumor tissue is 
not accessible, discussion with the GSK medical monitor is required.
Archival tissue m ay be accepted as a pre -treatment specimen if the subject is treatment 
naïve . Subjects must have a platelet count of ≥75,000/mm3and a PT, I NR and aPTT that 
are WNL within 48 hours prior to the post- dose biopsy . If study  medication is held prior 
to the post- dose biopsy , dosing must be re- started and subjects should receive 4 
consecutive day s of dosing prior to collection of the biopsy .Specific timing of post-
treatment dose sample collection is defined in the T&E table. See Study  Procedures 
Manual (SPM) and central lab manual for additional details.

Deleted se ction 6.9.4. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related 
Outcomes Not Qualifying as SA Es
Rationale for Change: Removal of section as there have been no pre -defined disease -
related events.
Deleted Text:
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under stud y (i.e., disease 
progression or hospitalization due to disease progression) does not need to be reported as 
an SAE. Death due to disease under stud y is to be recorded on the Death CRF form. 
However, if the underly ing disease (i.e., progr ession) is greater than that which would 
normally  be expected for the subject, or if the investigator considers that there was a 
causal relationship between treatment with stud y medication(s) or protocol 
design/procedures and the disease progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.

Section7.7.
GSK525762 is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Medications that have a narrow therapeutic 
index and that are substrates of CYP3A4 should be administered with caution, as their 
metabolism may  be affected by  co-administration with GSK525762 and result in 
decreased exposure. These include alfentanil, cy closporine, dihy droergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentan yl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and theophy lline. 
GSK525762 is a substrate for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P -glycoprotein 
(Pgp) transporters. Therefore, potent inhibitors of these transporters, such as 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or ketoconazole, should be avoided.
GSK525762 in as inhibitor of organic anion transporter 1A1 (OAT1) and organic anion 
transporter 3 (OAT3 ) in vitro. Substrates of these transporters include agents such as 
methotrexate, penicillin G, and indomethacin. While co-administration of these agents 
with GSK525762 is not prohibited, they  should be used with caution and additional 
monitoring for adver se effects should be utilized.
Higher doses of oral steroids can cause enzy me induction.  As such, oral steroids should 
be used with caution (and discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor).  NOTE:  Topical or 
inhaled steroids are permitted. 
Questions regardi ng concomitant medications should be directed to the GSK Medical 
Monitor for clarification.
Section 8.2.2. Potential Drug Interactions with GSK525762
The precise in vivo metabolic liability  for GSK525762 has y et to be assessed. In vitro 
data suggests that GSK525762 is only  metabolized by  CYP3A4 and thus 
coadministration of inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided during the 
course of the stud y where possible as they  may  respectively  decrease or increase 
exposure to GSK525762. GSK525762 is consider ed to have a low risk of causing 
clinically  relevant perpetrator drug interactions with CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 
enzy mes and/or PgP, BCRP, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2 -K, BSEP or 
MRP2 transporters either via direct or metabolism -dependent inhibition.
GSK525762 was shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3 in vitro, however, the 
clinical impact of this inhibition is only  deemed a concern for sensitive substrates of 
OATP1B1 or OAT3 (e.g. methotrexate).
Potential interactions with other Cy tochrome P 450 metabolized drugs have not been 
assessed.
Higher doses of oral steroids can cause enzy me induction.  As such, oral steroids should 
be used with caution (and discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor).  NOTE:  Topical or 
inhaled steroids are permitted.

Revised Text:
First paragraph first sentence onwards
The primary  goal of Part 2 is to evaluate disease -specific efficacy  in subjects with NMC, 
SCLC, CRPC, TNBC ,  andER+BC and GI ST.
For NMC, efficacy  is defined as a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined as 
the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR or PR) of 20% relative to a 5% 
response rate suggesting no activity
For CRPC and SCL C, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate 
(defined as a percentage of subjects that have achieved as CR or PR; for CRPC 
subjects, defined as a percentage of subjects have PSA50 response ) of 30% 
relative to a 10% response rate suggesting no activity .
For TNBC, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined as 
a percentage of subjects that have achieved as CR or PR) of 25% relative to a 
10% response rate suggesting n o activity .
For ER+BC, efficacy  is defined as a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined 
as a percentage of subjects that have achieved as CR or PR) of 30% relative to a 
15% response rate suggesting no activity.
For GIST , efficacy  is defined as a disea se control rate (defined as a percentage of 
subjects that have achieved a CR or PR or SD that has lasted at least 16 weeks) of

Care Liver Events
Section 14.3.
Revised Text:
Subpoints I and II under section 14.3 is delete d
I.Fever
Safety  monitoring cy tokine blood samples may  be collected (based on Table 23 of the 
protocol). These samples include (but not limited to) assessments for TNF -alpha, IL -1,IL-
6, IL -10 as outlined in the SPM. 
Assess or inquire if the subject is exp eriencing in combination with fever: swelling, 
redness, extreme fatigue or nausea. 
II.Diarrhea
General considerations for diarrhea management
Rule out other or concomitant causes . These include medications (e.g., stool softeners, 
laxatives, antacids, etc) , infection by C. difficile or Candida species, partial bowel 
obstruction, malabsorption/lactose intolerance, fecal impaction, diets high in fiber or 
lactose.
For uncomplicated Grade 1 to 2 diarrhea (i.e., mild to moderate and defined as 
CTCAE Grade 1 -2 with no complicating signs or sy mptoms):
Dietary  modifications: stop all lactose containing products and eat small meals. A 
BRAT (banana, rice, apples, toast) diet can be helpful.
Hydration: drink 8 -10 large glasses of clear liquids per day (e.g., Gatorade o r broth)
Consider administration of standard dose of loperamide (subjects should have 
loperamide available in order to start at the first signs of diarrhea):
Initial dose of 4 mg followed b y 2 mg every  four hours or after every  unformed 
stool; maximum 16 m g/day.
Continuation of loperamide is suggested until diarrhea free for 12 hours
Consider a temporary  investigational drug dose interruption until sy mptoms have 
resolved to baseline or Grade 1. Re -treatment with GSK525762 may  then be 
resumed at 100%. Please refer to for additional guidance.
If mild to moderate diarrhea persists for more than 24 hours, administer loperamide 2 
mg every  two hours; maximum 16 mg/day . Consider adding oral antibiotics.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
489If mild to moderate diarrhea persists after 48 hours total tre atment with loperamide, 
start second -line agents (otreotide, budesonide or tincture of opium). Consider 
adding oral antibiotics.
For Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea or complicated Grade 1 to 2 diarrhea (i.e., cramping,
nausea/vomiting ≥ Grade 2, decreased performance status, fever, sepsis, Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia, frank bleeding, deh ydration):
The subject must call the investigator immediatel y for an y complicated severe 
diarrhea event.
Discontinue GSK1120212 treatment and hold until sy mptoms resolve to Grade 1 or 
baseline. Consider re -starting therap y at a reduced dose.
If loperamide has not been initiated, initiate loperamide immediately . Initial dose 4 
mg followed b y 2 mg every  two hours or after every  unformed stool; maximum 16 
mg/day .
For deh ydration, use intravenous fluids as appropriate; if severe dehy dration, 
administer octreotide.
Administer antibiotics as needed (e.g., fluoroquinolones), especially  if diarrhea is 
persistent bey ond 24 hours or there is fever or G rade 3 to 4 neutropenia.
Intervention should be continued until the subject is diarrhea free for at least 24 
hours.
Intervention may  require hospitalization for subjects most at risk for life -threatening 
complications.
III.Hepatobiliary  Events
Monitoring, Interruption, and Stopping Criteria for Hepatobiliary Events
Liver chemistry stopping criteria are defined as follows: 
ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xUL N (>35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT 3xULN and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured)
*serum bilirubin fractionation shoul d be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, 
withdraw subject (if ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin 2xUL N) and measure urinary  
bilirubin via dipstick
** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply  to 
subjects recei ving anticoagulants
ALT 5xULN.
ALT 3xULN if associated with sy mptoms (new or worsening) believed to be related to 
hepatitis (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness or 
jaundice) or h ypersensitivity  (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia)
ALT 3xULN persists for 4 weeks.
2011N118599_09 CONFIDENTIA L
BET115521
490ALT 3xULN and cannot be monitored weekl y for 4 weeks.
Subjects with AL T 3xULN and< 5xULN andbilirubin < 2xULN, who do not exhibit 
hepatitis sy mptoms or rash, can continue study  treatment as long as th ey can be 
monitored weekl y for 4 weeks. 
Refer to the diagram in Figure 7 for a visual presentation of the procedures listed 
below. When any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria is met, do the following:
Immediately discontinue subject from stud y treat ment 
Notify  the GSK Medical Monitor within 24 hours of learning of the abnormality  to 
confirm the subject’s study  treatment cessation and follow -up
Complete the liver event case report forms. If the event also meets the criteria of an 
SAE (see Section 6.9.2of the protocol), the SAE data collection tool will be 
completed separatel y with the relevant details
All events of ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) (or 
ALT3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured; INR measurement is not required 
and t he threshold value stated will not apply  to subjects receiving 
anticoagulants), termed ‘Hy ’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE (excluding 
studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis).
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediatel y available, and i f 
ALT≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xUL N, discontinue subject from study  treatment. 
Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If 
testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on 
dipstick , indicating dire ct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury
Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy  CRFs if these tests are performed
Perform liver event follow up assessments as outlined below, and monitor the subject 
until liver chemistries resolve, stabi lize, or return to baseline values as described 
below
For studies where survival or progression is an endpoint, follow -up for overall 
survival or progression is required following discontinuation from study  treatment. 
Do not restart investigational produc t unless written approval is granted by GSK 
Medical Governance, whereupon the subject continues in the study  after completion 
of the liver chemistry  monitoring. See Section IIIcof Appendix 3 for drug 
restart/rechallenge process.
In addition, for subjects meeting liver stopping criterion 1: 
Make every  reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24 hours for 
repeat liver chemistries, liver event follow up assessments (refer to Section IIIa of 
Appendix 3 ), and close monitoring
A specialist or hepatology  consultation is recommended
Monitor subjects twice weekl y until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values.

If subject meets liver chemistry  stopping criteria do not restart/rechallenge subject with 
study  treatment unless:
GSK Medical Governance approval is granted (as described below),
Ethics and/or I RB approval is obtained, if required, and
Separate consent for treatment restart/rechallenge is signed b y the subject

BET115521
496If GSK Medical Governance approval to restart/rechallenge subject with study  treatment 
is not granted , then subject must permanentl y discontinue study  treatment and may  
continue in the study  for protocol -specified follow up assessments
14.3.2.1 Rechallenge Following Liver Stopping Events that are Possibly Related to 
Study Treatment
Following drug -induced liver injury , drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% 
mortality across all drugs in prospect ive studies [Andarde , 2009]. Clinical outcomes 
vary by drug, with nearl y 50% fatalit y with halothane readministered within one month 
of initial injury . However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatalit y. 
Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include:
hypersensitivity  with initial liver injury  (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia) 
[Andarde ,2009] 
jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury  (direct bilirubin >35% of 
total)
subject currently  exhibits severe liver injury defined by : ALT 3xUL N, 
bilirubin 2xUL N (direct bilirubin >35% of total), or INR 1.5
serious adverse event or fatality  has earlier been observed with drug 
rechallenges [ Papay , 2009]
evidence of drug- related preclinical liability  (e.g. reactive metabolite s; 
mitochondrial impairment [ Hunt , 2010])
Rechallenge refers to resuming study  treatment following drug induced liver injury  
(DILI). Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI this should only  be 
considered for a subject for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical 
or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a 
benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favourable.
Approval b y GSK for rechallenge with study treatment c an be considered where:
Investigator requests consideration of rechallenge with study  treatment for a subject 
who is receiving compelling benefit with study  treatment that exceeds risk, and no 
effective alternative therapy  is available. 
Ethics Committee o r Institutional Review Board approval for rechallenge with study  
treatment must be obtained, as required.  
If the rechallenge is approved by GSK Medical Governance in writing, the subject 
must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of study  
treatment administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver 
injury  or death. 
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the 
rechallenge with study  treatment. Documentation of informed consent must be 
recorded in the study  chart.

Subjects approved b y GS K Medical Governance for rechallenge with stud y 
treatment must return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry  tests until stable 
liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then standard laboratory  monitoring 
may resume as per protocol.
If after study treatment rechallenge, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistry  
stopping criteria, study  treatment should be permanently  discontinued. 
Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as

14.3.2.2. Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Stopping Events 
NOT Related to Study Treatment
Restart refers to resuming stud y treatment following liver stopping events in which there 
is a clear underl ying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary  obstruction, 
pancreatic events, hy potension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there should be no 
evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hy persensitivity, and the study  treatment should not be 
associated with HLA markers of liver injury.
Appro val by GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where:
Investigator requests consideration for stud y treatment restart if liver chemistries 
have a clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary  obstruction, hy potension and liver 
chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T 
<3xUL N).
Restart risk factors (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hy persensitivity , alcoholic 
hepatitis, possible study  treatment -induced liver injury  or study  treatment has an 
HLA genetic marker associated with liver injury  (e.g. lapatinib, abacavir, 
amoxicillin/clavulanate) are reviewed and excluded
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of study  treatment restart 
must be obtained, as required.
If restart of stud y treatment is approved b y GSK Medical Governance in writing, the 
subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of 
study  treatment administration, including the possibility  of recurrent, more severe 
liver injury  or death. 
The subject must also pro vide signed informed consent specificall y for the study  
treatment restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study  
chart. 
Study  treatment must be administered at the dose specified by  GSK.

498Subjects approved b y GS K Medical Governanc e for restarting stud y treatment must 
return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries 
have been demonstrated and then laboratory  monitoring may  resume as per protocol. 
If after study  treatment re -start, subject me ets protocol -defined liver chemistry  
stopping criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions.
Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as 
required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following stud y treatment 
restart. 
GSK, or designee, to be notified of an y adverse events, as per Section 6.9.

Background Information on Drug Restart/Rechallenge
Following drug -induced liver injury , drug restart or rechallenge is associated with a 
13% mortality across all drugs in prospective studies (Expert Opin Drug Saf 
2009;8:709 -714). Clinical ou tcomes vary  by drug, with nearl y 50% fatality with 
halothane readministered in one month of initial injury. However, some drugs seldom 
result in recurrent liver injury  or fatalit y. Risk factors for a fatal drug restart/rechallenge 
outcome include: h ypersen sitivity1with initial liver injury  (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia), 
jaundice or bilirubin>2xULN or INR>1.5 suggesting severe liver injury , prior I P-related 
severe or fatal drug restart/rechallenge ( Papay , 2009; Hunt , 2010) or evidence of drug -
related pre clinical liability  / mitochondrial impairment (Hunt , 2010).

If GSK provides written approval for restart/rechallenge following the above review, the 
Principal I nvestigator (PI) must ensure t he following:
The PI  is to obtain Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board review of 
drug reinitiation, as required. 
PI must discuss the possible benefits and risks of drug reinitiation with the 
subject.
The subject must sign informed consent with a clear description of possible 
benefits and risks of drug administration, including recurrent liver injury  or 
death. Consent specifically  for the IP restart must be recorded in the study  chart.

501In addition, in order to assign a response of CR in a subject with bone disease at baseline, 
a bone scan must be performed within the timeframe of 1 week prior to the first of 
images showing CR to 4 weeks after the next protocol specif ied assessment.
II. Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease
Non-Measurable only disease : The presence of only  non- measurable lesions. Note: non -
measurable onl y disease is not allowed per protocol.
IIId. Evaluation of overall response
Note Bullet point 3
The d osing schedule, dosing interruptions and design (see Table 2 of the protocol 
Time and Events Tables ) should be considered when assessing tumor response. 
Thus, subjects with PD before the Week 9 visit 8, but without rapid clinical 
deterioration, may  continue planned dosing schedule to allow detection of antitumor 
response. It is recommended that subjects who experience investigator -determined 
PD at the w Week 9visit8, at the discretion of the investigator, may  receive 
additional tumor assessment before the initiation of alternative anticancer therap y.

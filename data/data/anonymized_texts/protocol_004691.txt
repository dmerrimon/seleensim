Number  MEN1611-02 
Title Open-label, Multicentre, Phase Ib/II Study of MEN1611, a PI3K Inhibitor, and Cetuximab in Patients with PIK3CA  Mutated 
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Failing Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin, 5 -FU 
and Anti-EGFR Containin
g Regimens 
Acronym C-PRECISE-01 
Phase Ib/II 
Indication Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide gen e 
(PIK3CA ) mutated, N-K-RAS and BRAF  wild type, metastatic 
colorectal cancer, in patients failing irinotecan, oxaliplatin,  5-FU 
and anti- epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing re
gimens. 
Number of Sites and Countries Approx. 29 sites in Europe and US. 
Investigational Medicinal Product, Treatment Regimen (including route of administration) MEN1611, oral capsule: 16 mg capsules to be administered twice 
daily (BID) for a continuous 28-da y cycle. Patients will receiv e 
MEN1611 either 48 mg or 32 mg  BID (as 3 or 2 capsules, 
respectively), for a total daily  dose of 96 mg or 64 mg, respec tively. 
MEN1611 should be taken with a glass of water in fasting condition, i.e. at least 2 hours af ter the patient’s meal and a t least 
1 hour before the next mealPatients should take capsules at approximately the s ame time each day. 
Cetuximab, solution for infusion: A loading intravenous (IV) dose 
of 400 mg/m2 of cetuximab is adminis tered as a 120 minutes 
infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed by weekly IV infusion (60 minutes) of 250 mg/m
2 maintenance doses starting from Day 8 
of Cycle 1. Premedication with a c orticosteroid and a histamine -1 
(H1) receptor antagonist (e. g. d-chlorpheniramine or 
diphenhydramine) is required prior to cetuximab administration. 
Infusion reactions due to cetuximab are to be managed according to Section 8.4.5 .

MEN1611 will be given in combination with weekly IV infusion of  
cetuximab until objective disease  progression is documented or 
another criterion for disconti nuation is met. If cetuximab need s to 
be discontinued due to toxicity, patients may stay on study to 
receive MEN1611 as monotherap y. 
Design  This is an open-label, dose-confirmation and cohort expansion, multicentre, Phase Ib/II study. Step 1 (Confirmation of Dose for Cohort Expansion) :

Study Duration The overall study duration will depend on the completion of the  
dose levels/cohorts, the number of patients to be treated per e ach 
dose-cohort and the completion of Step 2 up to a total of 40 
evaluable patients for efficacy. All patients pre-screened for the PIK3CA  mutation will undergo a 
maximum 4 weeks Screening Period.  Each treatment cycle will last 28 days.  Individual study duration will depend on the duration of the st udy 
treatment which continues up to disease progression or study discontinuation for other reasons. The End of Study Visit will be p erformed 4 weeks after the last  dose 
of MEN1611.  Survival Follow-up: After the End of Study Visit, all patients evaluable for effica cy will 
be followed for survival status according to local practice (a visit or 
a telephone call) every 1 2 weeks up to the End of Study.  
 End of Study: The study ends with the End of Study Visit of the last patient who 
discontinues the study treatment. For safety monitoring, all serious  adverse events (SAEs) with a  
suspected causal relationship to the study treatment that occur  after 
the End of Stud
y must be recorded and notified to the Sponsor.

Study Procedures and 
Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Safety Assessments 
(see also flow chart)  Pre-screening Period: At the Pre-screening Visit, all pre-screening eligible patients  will 
perform mutational analysis for PIK3CA , BRAF  and N-K-RAS  in 
plasma (ctDNA centrally analysed) following provision of the written pre-screening informed con sent. Inclusion into the stud y 
will be done based on the results of the ctDNA.  Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1): During the 28 days prior to the first dose of MEN1611 and following provision of written informed consent, each patient w ill 
be screened for eligibility. Pati ents entering the screening pe riod 
with pre-screening ctDNA test older than 3 months need to be centrally re-tested for PIK3CA , N-K-RAS and BRAF  in plasma. 
The following procedures will be  performed at Screening: 
 Check of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 Recording of demographic data. 
 Standard medical, surgic al and medica tion history. 
 Assessment of ECOG PS. 
 Smoking history and current  smoking status. 
 Physical examination including vital signs (i.e. BP, heart rate, respiratory r ate, body temperature) and weight.

HBcAg antibodies, anti-HBsAg antibodies, HBsAg, HBV-DNA 
and HCV-RNA.  Urinalysis: Urinalysis will be performed at the local laboratory and will include: pH, density, proteins , glucose, ketones, and nitrite.  
Microscopy will be performed when required (i.e., RBC, WBC, epithelial cells, casts, bacteria, 
yeast and cr ystals).  
Study Endpoints Primary: 
Step 1 (Identification of Dose for Cohort Expansion): 
 Identification of the dose for the Cohort Expansion, defined as the highest dose level (maximum dose tested 48 mg BID, minimal dose tested 32 mg BID) at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT during the DLT assessment window (see DLT definition).  
Step 2 (Cohort Expansion Phase): 
 Best overall response rate (ORR) defined according to RECIST v1.1 assessment locally performed using CT scan or MRI of the chest and a bdomen (including pelvis and 
adrenal glands). Any other ar eas of disease involvement 
should be additionally invest igated based on signs and 
symptoms of the individual patient. 
Secondary: 
 Safety and tolerability:  
- Incidence, severity as per CTCAE version 5.0 grading, seriousness and treatment-causality of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 
- Frequency of clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, safety la boratory tests, urinalysis, 
vital signs and 12-lead ECG. 
 PK profile: MEN1611 plasma con centration-time data will 
be anal ysed usin g a population P K approach. A nonlinear

mixed effects model will be used to determine population 
PK parameters and their as sociated variabilities (e.g. 
apparent systemic clearance [CL/F], [V/F], [Ka]). Individual PK parameters (e.g. area under the concentration time curve [AUC], maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax]) will be estimated using a post hoc analysis. 
 Disease Control Rate (DCR) defined as percentage of patients whose disease shrink s or remains stable over a 
certain time period. DCR is the sum of the complete, partial and stable disease rates acco rding to local assessment.  
 Duration of response defined as time from confirmation of a PR, complete response (CR)  or SD as locally assessed, 
until the disease has been shown to progress following treatment.  
 Progression-free survival (PFS): Defined as the number of days between the first study tr eatment administration to the 
date of first documented disease progression as per local assessment, relapse or death from any cause. Responding patients and patients who are lo st to follow-up are censored 
at their last tumour assessment date. 
 Overall Survival (OS): Defined as the number of days between the first study treatme nt administration and death 
from any cause. 
For the baseline assessment, CT scan or MRI should be performed  
no more than 4 weeks before the start of study treatment. Follo w-up 
assessment will be performed every 2 cycles during study treatm ent 
starting from Day 1 Cycle 3 (wit hin a window of 7 days before t he 
visit date) until objective disease progression as defined by R ECIST 
v1.1 or at the End of Study Visit. Any other site at which a ne w 
disease is suspected should be  appropriately imaged. If an 
unscheduled assessment is perfor med and the disease has not 
progressed, subsequent assessments should be performed at their  
scheduled visits.

All patients receiving at least 80% of MEN1611 and 75% of 
cetuximab during Cycle  1 with a Safety Follow-up of 28 days aft er 
the first administration of the study treatment. Any patient wh o 
experiences a DLT will also be considered evaluable, regardless  of 
the dose of MEN1611 received.  Patients enrolled in the Dose-c onfirmation Phase (Step 1), who are 
not DLT evaluable, will be replaced. Safety population: All patients receiving a t least 1 dose of MEN1611. 
Efficacy population: All eligible patients who receive at least 2 complete treatment  
cycles and have at least 1 disease assessment are to be conside red 
evaluable for efficacy. PK population: All patients receiving the study treatment and for whom a PK sample is obtained and anal
ysed. 
Statistical Analysis All study variables (with the exception of PK variables) will b e 
presented by dose cohort and o verall, using the appropriate 
descriptive statistics according to the variable nature, unless  
otherwise specified: 
 Continuous variables:  Number of non-missing 
observations, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum. 
 Categorical variables: Number of non-missing observations and column  percentages (N, %). 
 Time to event variables:  Number of non-missing 
observations, number and percentage of censored observations, 1
st quartile, median (a nd its 95% confidence 
interval [CI]), 3rd quartile, Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
and event rate every 28 days. 
The behaviour over time of study variables will be summarised b y

5 ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS 
5.1 General Aspects 
This study will be carried out in compliance with the study pro tocol, the recommendations on biomedical 
research on human patients of the Declaration of Helsinki, Inte rnational Council for Harmonisation – 
Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Guidelines, European Union (EU ) Directive 2001/20 April 04, 2001 
as amended and national requirements of the participating count ries. 
The Sponsor has contracted the C ontract Research Organisation ( CRO), to perform some of the 
Sponsor’s study-related duties and functions (e.g. study initia tion, clinical conduct, monitoring and 
termination as well as project management). The Sponsor will pe rform study planning and preparation, 
medical monitoring and safety management, medical writing and q uality management data management 
and statistical analysis. The ultimate responsibility for the q uality and the integrity of the study resides 
with the Sponsor. The study will be conducted in agreement with  Sponsor’s or CRO’s Standard 
Operating Procedures’ (SOP ) requirements  as agreed. 
All clinical work cond ucted under this protocol is subject to G CP rules. This includes audits/inspections 
by the Sponsor and/or its delegate (e.g. CRO) and/or by national/international Health Authority 
representatives at any time. All Investigators must agree to the audits/inspection of the study site, 
facilities and of study-related records by the Health Authority  representatives and/or by the Sponsor 
and/or its delegates, which must be performed in accordance wit h national laws concerning personal data 
protection. 
5.2 Independent Ethics Committee and Legal Requirements 
Before starting the study at a study site, the study protocol a nd relevant documentation must be submitted 
to and approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent E thics Committees (IRB/IEC) and the 
Competent Authorities (CAs) of  the participating countries. 
In addition, all local national le gal requirements for the cond uct of a clinical study have to be followed 
prior to the start of the study. The CAs and IRB/IECs of the pa rticipating countries will be informed 
about any changes in the study protocol, the end of the study, or the premature study termination as 
appropriate and within the requested time period.  
5.3 Patient Information and Declaration of Consent 
Before any study-related procedures may be performed, informed consent must be obtained from the 
patient by means of a signed declaration. The Informed Consent Form (ICF) must be approved in the corresp onding local language and in 
accordance with local laws and re gulations by the IRB/IEC prior  to being s ubmitted to the patient.

I n  t h e  p a t i e n t  i n f o r m a tion leaflet, patient s will be given info rmation and a fully comprehensive 
explanation in easily understandable terms of the study procedu res, regarding the benefits, discomforts 
and risks in taking part in the study, the properties of the st udy treatment, the method of assignment to 
treatments and any med ically accepted and readily available tre atment other than the study treatment. 
Patients will also be informed a bout the measures taken to ensu re their confidentiality according to the 
pertinent legislation.  
After being duly informed and interviewed by the Investigator, the patient has to freely date (including 
time) and sign the ICF in duplicat e before being enrolled into the study and before u ndergoing any study 
procedure. The Investigator must store one original of the sign ed ICF in the Investigator’s File and the 
patient will be provided with the other one. The process of obt aining the ICF has to be documented in 
the source documents. If a protocol amendment would affect the terms of the ICF, it w ill be revised to reflect the protocol 
change and submitted to IRB/IEC for approval. The Investigator will ensure that this new ICF is signed 
by all patients subsequently entered in the study and those cur rently in the study, before the changes take 
effect on their participation in  the study. Patients who do not  sign the new ICF need to be terminated 
from the study participation. 
5.4 Patient Insurance 
For patients participating in the  study, the Spon sor, Menarini Ricerche S.p.A. has stipulated an insurance 
policy in accordance with local regulatory requirements. Details on the insurance company, the insurance number and cond itions will be made available to 
patients in the ICF and/or provided as a separate document, in accordance with national requirements. 
A copy of the insurance certificate will be provided to each In vestigator and will be filed in the 
Investigator’s File at the sites and in the study’s Trial Maste r File (TMF). 
5.5 Documentation of Study-related  Data and Record Retention 
It is the responsibility of the I nvestigator to document all st udy-related data for each patient in a case 
report form (CRF). For this study, an electronic CRF (eCRF) wil l be used. The Investigator has to 
guarantee the accuracy of the documented data and has to commen t on any missing or spurious data. 
In addition to the eCRF, the In vestigator will maintain adequat e records that fully document the 
participation of the patient in the clinical study, including t he study assessments (patient source data 
documentation). Details on the source data documentation are pr ovided in Section 10.3.  
Requirements for record retention are specified in Section 5.11.5 .

No study documents should be destroyed without prior written ag reement between the Sponsor and 
Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to move the study re cord to another location, he/she must 
notify the Sponsor in writing. 
5.6 Confidentiality 
By signing the study protocol, the Investigator affirms that an y information provided  by the Sponsor will 
be maintained in conf idence and that such information will be d ivulged to IRB/IECs or CAs only under 
an appropriate understanding of confidentiality with such a com mittee or institution. 
In order to maintain the patient ’s confidentiality, all data co llected by the Investigator will be recorded 
pseudonymously in the eCRF. Patie nt’s data will be identified b y a unique patient number. The 
Investigator must agree that within national regulatory restric tions and ethical considerations, 
representatives of the Sponsor, any regulatory agency and IRB/I EC may consult study source documents 
in order to verify data in the eCRF. Patient medical records pe rtinent to the study will be reviewed by 
the Study Monitor to ensure adequate source documentation, accu racy and completeness of eCRFs. The 
review will be conducted in accordance with relevant SOPs and w ith strict adherence to professional 
standards of confidentiality, GCP and the relevant data protect ion legislation. 
5.7 Protocol/Protocol Modifications 
The protocol must be read thoroughly by everyone, the informati on therein, concerns and the instructions 
must be exactly followed. 
Changes in the study protocol will require a protocol amendment . Such amendments will be agreed upon 
and approved in writing by all signatories of the protocol. If amendments are substantial, i.e. they are

on personal data protection such as the EU General Data Protect ion Regulation 679/2016 and the EU 
Regulation on clinical trials on medicinal products for human u se 536/2014. 
This section defines the appropriate technical and organisation al measures that shall be implemented 
to protect information and person al data processed against unau thorised or unlawful access, 
disclosure, dissemination, altera tion, or destruction or accidental loss as well as to assure the 
fulfilment of patient s’ privacy rights. 
5.11.2  Acknowledgment 
The Site, the Principal Investigator, the Central Laboratories,  the CRO as well as their appointed staff 
and service providers  acknowledge that:  
(a) The performance of the study will imply processing of sensi tive personal data; 
(b) Personal data processing is regulated by the applicable Eur opean (i.e. the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation 679/2016 and the EU Regulation on clinical trials on medicinal 
products for human use 536/2014) and local laws (i.e. the laws of the country where the study 
is conducted) as well as by the Sp onsor’s national legislation.  In particular, it is hereby 
acknowledged that bein g the Sponsor a company incorporated unde r Italian law, it has to 
mandatorily comply with Italian legal provisions on data protec tion: therefore, the Site, the 
Principal Investigator, the Central Laboratories, the CRO shall  cooperate with the Sponsor to 
allow the fulfilment of such obligations; 
(c) Strict compliance with the a pplicable data protection laws and this section of the protocol is 
deemed by the Sponsor as an essential condition of collaboration with the Site, the Principal Investigator, the Central Laboratories, and the CRO.

instruments (e.g. if pursuant to the local laws the site is a d ata processor of the Sponsor, a Data 
Processing Agreement will be finalised; if pursuant to the loca l laws Sponsor and site are join 
controllers, a Joint Controller ship Agreement will be finalised ). 
5.11.4  Duties of the Parties involved in the Performance of the Study 
Collection and use of patients' personal data (i.e. patients' d ata), including their biological samples, 
will be carried out in full respect of the provisions of the in formation notices submitted to patients, 
as well as the privacy rights, the fundamental freedoms and the  dignity of data subjects. All the parties 
involved in this study undertake to adopt adequate measures to warrant that data will always be 
processed securely and in com pliance with privacy laws. 
The site, the Principal Investigator, the Sponsor, the CRO and the central laboratories as well as their 
appointed staff and service providers, each in its respective remit and within the limits of their specific role in the study shall implement the following safety measures  (physical, logical,  organizational, 
technical, electronic, IT etc.) to ensure adequate protection o f the personal data of the patients 
involved in the st udy. In particular: 
(i) DATA SAFETY.  The site and/or the Principal Investigator shall adopt all the  necessary measures 
to prevent or minimise the ris ks of theft, fire, flooding, part ial or total loss, accidental disclosure or 
illegal/unauthorised access to pat ient’s data or Sponsor’s prop rietary confidential information; to this 
extent, before the beginning of the study, the site and/or the Principal Investigator shall ensure that 
the actual measures they have implemented are fit-for-purpose a nd law-compliant, and in particular: 
 In order to minimise the risk of  unauthorized access and theft,  the hardware on which patients’ 
personal data are stored shall be placed in a restricted-access  area, accessible only to those 
individuals who need to retrieve  the patients’ personal data in cluded in the database for 
professional purposes; the same s afeguards shall be put in plac e for non-electronic databases; 
 Any electronic database containi ng the patients’ personal data shall be password-protected by 
means of a strong password. System s shall be set so that passwo rds must be updated at least 
every three months and feature at least 8 characters, with uppe r-case and lower-case 
recognition, containing at least three "special" characters, su ch as upper case letters [A-Z], 
lower case letters [a-z], numbers [0-9], symbols [!, #, $, etc. ] or other special characters [Á, ë, 
ö, etc.]. Passwords shall not include elements which may easily  be associated with the assignee 
or information regarding him/her,  such as name and year of birt h [e.g. “johnbrown80”] or easily 
predictable strings of charact ers [e.g. “qwerty”, “12345”, “adm in”, “user”, etc.]);

 Adequate cryptographic protection measures shall be put in plac e for data “at rest” and “in 
transit” (these include, for example, file system or database c ryptography, or any other 
equivalent IT measure which re nders data unintelligible to thos e who are not authorised to 
access them);  
 High level security measures shall be implemented also on the f iles or databases which contain 
the “key” to match the patients’ personal data (i.e. name, surn ame, etc.) with their respective 
“Patient IDs” (as defined at point (iv) below); 
 Backup processes and other measures that ensure rapid restoration of business critical systems 
shall be implemented; 
 Updated antivirus and firewall programs shall be installed on the IT devices. 
The site shall regularly test and update the measures listed ab ove.  
The site shall, upon request from the Sponsor and/or the CRO, p rovide detailed written information 
about the measures listed above.  The CRO shall ensure that the selected sites for the study have  implemented the above listed 
measures.  (ii) TRANSMISSION OF DATA . All the parties that transfer data through internet and/or to  the 
centralised database(s) used to  process study’s data or to gene rate statistical analyses shall implement 
secure protocols based on cryptog raphic standards which make da ta unintelligible  to unauthorized 
individuals. (iii) SECURITY OF THE CENTRALISED DATA BASE . The centralised database held by the 
Sponsor shall have the follo wing safeguards in place:  
 Appropriate authentication method s, which differentiate between  different users according to 
their respective roles so as to  ensure that access to a specifi c set of patients' data is permitted 
exclusively to those for whom access to such data is essential in the context of their work for 
the study; 
 Appropriate measures to ensure that the authentication credenti als are periodically updated (i.e. 
password change); 
(iv) PSEUDONYMISATION . All personal data that may allow identification of the patients 
involved in the study shall be adequately dissociated from the other data pertaining to the study 
(“pseudo-anonymisation” process). The Principal Investigator sh all adequately dissociate the 
identification data of patients from the data pertaining to the  study by linking results to a an 
alphanumerical code “Patient Identification (ID)”, whose format  shall not make it possible to identify

the patient directly or indirec tly, so as to ensure that only a nonymous data are transmitted to the 
Sponsor, the central laboratories and /or the CRO. The site/Pri ncipal Investigator shall securely store 
a separate list (e.g. identification log) with the identification code, together with a ll signed informed 
consents, in accordance with the security measures as defined a bove.  
As outlined below, samples shall only be stored for as long as s t r i c t l y  n e c e s s a r y  f o r  t h e  s t u d y ’ s  
performance and will be stored for up to 10 years after the end  of the clinical study. Biological 
samples and any other examination (e.g. X-ra y, electrocardiogram [ECG]) shall bear Patient ID, and 
in no case will they bear other information that may lead to th e direct or indirect i dentification of the 
patient, especially when, in accordance with this protocol, sam ples shall be forwarded and shared 
outside the clinical site (e.g. in case of centralized reading or local laborat ory analysis).  
(v) TRAINING . The parties shall ensure that any personnel involved in the study have received 
proper training on data protection issues. 
All actions related to the implementation of the afore mentione d measures shall be provided by the 
Sponsor, the site and/or the CRO to the CAs (including data pro tection authorities) and IRB/IECs if 
and when requested. If such authorities or the Sponsor consider the implementation of the afore mentioned measures insufficient to guarantee an adequate level of protection of the patients’ personal 
data, the site, the Principal Investigator, the CRO and the cen tral laboratories undertake to adopt all 
the necessary activities to overcome such remarks to assure the full compliance with the data protection laws. 
5.11.5  Archiving of the Clinical Trial Master File and Patients’ Perso nal Data 
Unless other countries laws require archiving for a longer peri od, the Sponsor, the site and the 
Principal Investigator shall archive the content of the clinica l trial master file, including the relevant 
patients’ personal data, for at least 25 years after the end of  the clinical study. However, medical 
records shall be archived in accordance with the national laws of the country where the study is 
performed. The patient code pairing list (i.e. the list that wh ere the Patient ID is linked to the patients’ 
identification data such as name a nd surname), shall be archive d care of the Principal Investigator. 
The content of the clinical TMF shall be archived in a way that  ensures that it is readily available and 
accessible, upon request, to the CAs. Any transfer of ownership of the  content of the clinical TMF sh all be documented. The new owner 
shall undertake the responsibil ities set out in t his protocol. 
The Sponsor appoints the study mana ger or delegates as responsi ble person/s for archives. Access to 
archives shall be restric ted to those individuals.

5.11.6  Data Breach  
Data Breach  is an incident regarding personal data security and leading to  the accidental or unlawful 
destruction, loss, alteration, una uthorised disclosure of, or a ccess to, personal data transmitted, stored 
or otherwise processed. In parti cular: Destruction of personal data is where the da ta no longer exists, 
or no longer exists in a form that is of any use to the site, S ponsor, CRO, Principal Investigator etc.; 
data loss is when the data may still exist, but the site, Spons or, CRO, Principal Investigator etc. has 
lost control or access to it, or no longer has it in its posses sion; damage is where personal data has 
been altered, corrupted, or is no longer complete; data unavail ability is where, following a data 
incident (such as a network outage, a natural or man-made disas ter, etc.), personal data become 
temporarily inaccessible to the site, Sponsor, CRO, Principal I nvestigator etc.  
Anomalous Event  is an event that is not part of the standard operational scope  of an infrastructure, 
network or service and which aff ects, or is likely to affect, p ersonal data; this may include theft or 
loss of IT devices and other physical events (e.g. an unauthori sed access to a locked storage room 
containing paper files with personal data), and/or electronic/I T anomalies (e.g. cyber-attacks, default 
or hacking of cloud services), which may in any way entail loss, unavailability, alteration, theft, copy 
or dissemination of p ersonal data.  
Whoever becomes aware in any way of an anomalous event and/or o f a data breach (see definitions 
above) affecting the patients’ pe rsonal data and/or personal da ta collected in the context of the study, 
shall, as appropriate, immediately (and in any case no later th an 24 hours from the knowledge of an 
anomalous event and/or of a data breach) inform the Study Manag er, the Sponsor’s Data Protection 
Officer (DPO), who may be contacted at dpo@menarini.com or dpo. germany@berlin-chemie.de, the 
site and the CRO [

6 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
6.1 Colorectal Cancer 
Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed c ancer worldwide and a leading 
cause of death. In the year 2012, the death toll was above 693 000 and there have been 1.4 million 
newly diagnosed cases worldwide ( 1-5). Up to 50% of these newly diagnosed patients have metastatic 
disease ( 2-3). These patients have an overall survival (OS) reported to be about 30 months in average. 
While this is a great improvement  to the state 20 years ago (OS  = 6 months), the prognosis for patients 
with metastatic CRC (mCRC) remains poor ( 1-3, 5 ). Besides a selected number of local therapies the 
vast majority of patients with m CRC receive systemic treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such 
as irinotecan, oxaliplatin, flur opyrimidines, in combination wi th targeted monoclonal antibodies, such 
as cetuximab, bevacizumab, panitu mumab, aflibercept, and ramuci rumab considered to be the 
currently accepted standard of care for first or second line tr eatment. Regorafenib and TAS-102 are 
currently indicated as monothera py in the refractory setting. Pembrolizumab, nivolumab and 
ipilimumab are further options i n patients with metastatic mism atch repair deficient CRC. 
However, the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen beyond second lin e treatment remains unclear and 
more than 30% of mCRC patients re ceive 3 or more lines of thera py (2-5). 
6.2 Cetuximab in Colorectal Cancer 
Cetuximab is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody (moAbs) direct e d  a g a i n s t  t h e  e x t r a c e l l u l a r  
domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The EGFR is a member of the tyrosine kinase 
family of growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity . It possesses an extracellular domain, 
which offers a ligand-binding site  for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and for transforming growth 
factor alpha (TGF ), a transmembrane domain and an  intracellular protein tyrosine  kinase element. 
The intracellular domain of EGFR is activated u pon ligand bindi ng, which triggers the EGF-mediated 
tyrosine kinase signal transducti on pathway and promotes cellul ar growth, division and survival. 
EGFR antibodies block the ligand-binding site to prevent its li nkage with TGF  and EGF resulting 
in interruption of this pathway i n order to reduce cellular pro liferation ( 6). 
Cetuximab revealed in numerous Pha se II and III clinical studie s a significant improvement in terms 
of progression-free survival (PFS), OS, response rate (RR), and quality of life (QoL), among different 
lines of treatment, both alone and i n combination with chemothe rapy ( 1). 
Expression or up-regulation of the EGFR gene happen in around 80% of colorectal cancers and are connected with metastatic risk. Nevertheless, the presence of an EGFR mutation is not linked to the efficacy of EGFR inhibition. In the last years, several finding s directed to the identification of other

predictive biomarkers: Initially KRAS , then NRAS and HRAS  as genes that might affect the efficacy 
of EGFR moAbs. 
The CRYSTAL study was the first one to evaluate the combination  of cetuximab and folinic acid, 
fluorouracil and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as first line treatment i n metastatic CRC: Patients with an 
EGFR positive tumour, were randomized to receive cetuximab plus  FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone. The 
combination showed an improvement in PFS (8.9 months vs 8.0 mon ths; hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.99; p=0.0048). In terms of RR, cetuximab plus FOLFIRI reached a significant advantage in compari son to FOLFIRI alone (RR 46.9% vs 38.7; P=0.004). There was no 
significant difference in OS  between the two groups: 19.9 month s vs 18.6 months. The retrospective 
subgroup analysis according to KRAS mutational status indicated t hat benefit of cetuximab was 
limited to patients with KRAS wild-type tumours: Median PFS (mPFS) with cetuximab-FOLFIRI an d 
FOLFIRI alone were 9.9 months and 8.7 months, respectively, in the wild type-KRAS population and 
7.6 and 8.1 months, respectively, in the mutant- KRAS population (HR 0.68, p=0.017). In patients with 
wild type KRAS tumours, the RR in the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group was 59.3% and i n the FOLFIRI 
group 43.2% (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.93). In mutated- KRAS tumours, RR was 36.2% in the 
cetuximab–FOLFIRI group and 40.2%  in the FOLFIRI group (OR, 0.8 0; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.45) (7-
8). When cetuximab is used as single agent in unselected patients w ith chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, 
it achieved a RR of only 10% ( 9-10). As reported by Karapetis et al. in patients with wild-type KRAS  
tumours, treatment with cetuximab significantly improved median  OS (mOS) (9.5 vs. 4.8 months; 
HR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.74; P<0.001) and mPFS (3.7 months vs. 1.9 months; HR 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.54; P<0.001) when compared to supportive care alone. In the cetuximab group, the RR 
among patients with wild-type KRAS tumours was 12.8%, only one patient with a mutated KRAS 
tumour (1.2%) had a response ( 11). 
All reported findings from post- hoc, retrospective and meta-ana lyses for anti-EGFR, confirmed a 
negative predictive value of KRAS exon 2 mutations ( 12). 
Furthermore, a new confirmation from the PRIME study with panit umumab indicated that mutations 
(other than those in KRAS exon 2) in exons 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2, 3 and 4 of NRAS (expanded 
RAS analysis) predict a lack of response to EGFR-monoclonal antibo dies ( 13). In a retrospective 
analysis of the FIRE-3 study, additional RAS mutations were detected, ob serving an improvement in 
mOS (33.1 versus 28.7 months) in patients with expanded RAS wild-type 
 tumours treated with 
cetuximab compared with those with KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumours treated with cetuximab ( 14). 
KRAS and NRAS mutations have been identified as biomarkers of resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies 
and cetuximab and panitumumab ar e currently recommended for mCR C patients expressing wild-

type RAS representing a standard of care in the first-line setting with  a particular benefit for patients 
with left-sided tumours ( 1). 
Cetuximab has also an important role in second or later-line of  t r e a t m e n t  a s  s i n g l e  a g e n t  o r  i n  
combination with irinotecan after progression to a previous che motherapy. In third line and beyond, 
refractory patients are also usually treated with available age nts that offer very limited opportunities 
of clinical efficacy. 
Recent findings express that particular patients cannot be cons idered lastingly resistant to biologic 
and cytotoxic agents and conversel y some tumours m ay maintain s ensitivity to cetuximab or recover 
sensitivity after a treatme nt break from this drug ( 5). 
Based on these observations, clinical studies have been conduct ed to investigate the role of 
rechallenge as new therapy choice for refractory metastatic col orectal cancer. 
In a multicentre retrospective analysis conducted by Santini et  al. 39 patients, previously progressed 
on cetuximab plus irinotecan-based therapy, were rechallenged w ith cetuximab plus irinotecan after 
a treatment pause during which they were treated with non-irino tecan-based chemotherapy. The 
mPFS was 6.6 months (95% CI, 4.1%-9.1%). Overall RR (ORR) with cetuximab plus irinotecan 
rechallenge was 53.8% (95% CI, 39.1%-63.7%) and included ninete en partial responses (48.7%) and 
two complete responses (5.1%). Stable disease was reached in 35 .9% of patients, for a total disease 
control rate of 89.7% ( 15). 
Similarly, in the E-Rechalle nge study, 33 patients with KRAS wild-type (WT) mCRC, refractory to 
previous fluoropyrimidines, oxali platin, irinotecan, cetuximab,  and bevacizumab and in whom 
previous treatment with cetuximab was effective in any earlier line, were rechallenged with cetuximab and oxaliplatin. Over all, 15.6% (95% CI, 5.3%-32.7%) of the patients had a partial 
response, 40.6% (95% CI, 23.6%-57.6%) had stable disease, and 43.8% (95% CI, 26.4%-62.3%) had a progressive disease. The mPFS was 88 days and OS was 262 days ( 16). 
In the recent prospective Phase II CRICKET study (Cetuximab Rechallenge in Irinotecan-pretreated 
mCRC, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF Wild-type Treated in 1st Line With An ti-EGFR Therapy), 28 
patients with KRAS WT metastatic colon cancer were rechallenged with third-line ce tuximab and 
irinotecan. ORR was 23% (95% CI,  10%-40%) with disease control rate of 54% (95% CI, 36%-70%) 
and the study met its primary end point. Patients with RAS WT circulating tumour deoxyribonucleic 
acid (ctDNA) had significantly longer PFS than those with RAS mutated ctDNA (4.0 vs 1.9 months; 
HR 0.44; 95% CI, 0.18-0.98) ( 17). 
In all these studies, findings suggest a clinical benefit and n o signal for increased toxicity. The 
selection may be improved by r echallenging patients who do not develop KRAS mutations ( 17). 
For this reason, retesting RAS status beyond progression to firs t-line cetuximab plus chemotherapy 
may be 
a useful approach to better identify candidates for cetu ximab rechallenge. Liquid biopsy offers

6.3 PI3K Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy 
Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) belonging to the family of h eterodimeric lipid kinases and 
consisting of a regulatory and a catalytic subunit control most  key regulatory factors in many cellular 
processes including cell cycle, s urvival, proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, motility, 
migration and genomic instability ( 18-21 ). 
PI3K is activated by EGFR, insulin growth factor (IGF-1R), several receptor tyrosine kinases, human 
EGFR 2 (HER2), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR). Once  activated PI3K mediates signals 
to a multitude of downstream effe ctors such as v-akt murine thy moma viral oncogene homolog 
(AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as well as promo ting additional cancer-
benefitting factors such as recruitment of inflammatory cells a nd angiogenesis. In most cases of 
cancer PI3K shows mutations that lead to hyperactivity, even if  not the case the downstream effector 
phosphatidylinositol-3,4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP 3) is constitutively elevated. Mutations in the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, cat alytic, alpha polypeptide gen e (PIK3CA ) encoding the catalytic 
isoform p110α of PI3K are frequen tly observed in several cancer types. These cancer types are breast, 
glioblastoma, gastric, ovary, lung and CRC, where it can be det ected in 10–20% of CRC patients. 
Most of these mutations (80%) ar e restricted to hot spots in exon 9 and exon 20 of PIK3CA . In 
addition to this activating mutation of PI3K another often obse rved oncogenic mutation is that of 
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homo log deleted from chromosome 10 ). PTEN encodes the major 
PIP 3 phosphatase which is the most important antagonistic factor in  the PI3K signalling cascade and 
correlates with a poor outcome in CRC patients. The PI3K pathway is also upregulated in cancer cells that show no genomic alterations i n PI3K and PTEN as other lesi ons are present activating the PI3K 
pathway such as activated tyrosine kinases, RAS, AKT; loss of L KB1 (STK11), INPP4B or TSC ( 18-
21). The combination of PIK3CA  mutation and RAS wild-type CRC has been reported to correlate with a 
negative prediction of response to anti-EGFR treatment (21 ).

6.4 PI3K Inhibitor and Cetuximab 
Preclinical data suggested that co mbination therapies directed against both PI3K and EGFR pathways 
might improve responses in head and neck squamous cell carcinom a (HNSCC) ( 22-24). Given these 
promising data, several clinical studies assessing cetuximab in  combination with inhibitors of PI3K 
have been opened in HNSCC. 
In a Phase I, dose-finding study,  eleven patients were enrolled  to determine the safety, maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and antitumour activity of PX-866, a 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in hibitor, combined with cetuxima b in patients with advanced CRC or 
HNSCC. The RP2D was 8 mg, the sa me as the single-agent PX-866 M TD. No dose limiting toxicities 
were observed. Best responses in 9 evaluable patients were: 4 p artial responses (44.4%), 4 stable 
disease (44.4%), and 1 disease progression (11.1%). The mPFS wa s 106 days ( 25). Unfortunately, a 
Phase II study, combining PX-866 with cetuximab failed to achie ve improved PFS or OS compared 
to cetuximab alone, suggesting th at a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action 
that drive response to PI3K and E GFR therapies is essential ( 26). 
6.5 Study Rationale 
CRC is a heterogeneous disease in which genomic analysis provid es data on the presence of activating 
mutations in the KRAS, NRAS and others genes. This approach offers criteria for the select ion of 
patients for the anti-EGFR therapy. KRAS and NRAS mutations have been identified as biomarkers 
of resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies and they are currently recommended for mCRC patients expressing WT RAS ( 1). However, only a small percentage of mCRC patients are sensit ive to anti-
EGFR therapy and even the subgroup of patients who initially re spond, finally become refractory in 
around 3-18 months (secondary resistance). Primary and acquired resistance has been shown to be the princi pal cause of the failure of anti-EGFR 
drugs: RAS mutations only account for nearly 35%-50% of non-responsive pa tients. Recent studies 
have detected mutations in several genes in the EGFR signalling  pathway, such as BRAF , PIK3CA  
and PTEN ( 27-28). 
Mutations of PIK3CA  are described in around 10-18% o f mCRC patients and can coexis t with both 
RAS (concomitant KRAS  mutation about 50%) and BRAF  mutations (29 ). Their prevalence in CRC 
increases continuously from the rectum to the cecum, according the colorectal continuum model. 
More than 80% of PIK3CA  mutations occur in exon 9 or exon 20 and patients who present double 
mutations have a worse prognosis. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/ AKT/PTEN signalling 
pathways are strictly connected. EGFR in fact, also triggers th e PIK3CA/PTEN signalling cascade 
and both can be blocked by EGFR in hibitors, causing tumour cell apoptosis.

In mCRC, clinical and preclinical studies have tried to identif y PIK3CA  mutations as a predictor of 
lack of response to anti-EGFR therapy. Biochemical studies showed that exon 9 mutations induces 
gain of function through RAS-GTP  binding, while exon 20 mutatio ns seems to act independently by 
RAS-GTP interaction ( 30-31). In a retrospective analysis o f 110 mCRC patients treated wit h 
cetuximab or panitumumab, a statistically significant associati on between PIK3CA  mutations and 
primary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies was found in the population with KRAS WT tumours ( 32). 
A large retrospective analysis conducted by the European consortium investigated the effect of PIK3CA  mutations on the response to cetuximab: In the KRAS WT population, carriers of PIK3CA  
exon 20 mutations showed significantly lower response rates tha n carriers of WT PIK3CA . Exon 9 
mutations revealed no significant effect and this result sugges ts its secondary role on cetuximab 
efficacy (27 ). Two additional meta-analyses have highlighted that only PIK3CA  exon 20 mutations 
were associated with a lack of response to anti-EGFR moAbs in t erms of ORR, PFS, and OS in WT 
KRAS mCRC population (33-34). Overall, it appears clear that PIK3CA  exon 9 and exon 20 mutations 
differ in their predictive role. In summary, over the past few year s clinical studies have showe d that aberrant biomarkers, other than 
RAS mutations, such as BRAF  mutations, PIK3CA  mutations, PTEN loss and others, result in 
resistance to anti-EGFR therapy mainly through constitutive act ivation of EGFR downstream 
signalling pathways, irrespectiv e of EGFR blockade. These findi ngs have led to target BRAF  mutant, 
HER2-amplified and microsatellite-unstable CRCs, demonstrating important benefit ( 35). Due to the 
presence of oncogenic activation of the PI3K/AKT/PTEN cascade i n several cancers and its relevance 
in crucial cellular functions, it is reasonable to assume that hitting the PI3K pathw ay might represent 
a strategic focus for the treatm ent of mCRC. Currently, there are no definite therapies for PIK3CA  
mutated metastatic colorectal cancer patients and this populati on is treated with available anticancer 
agents. PIK3CA  mutations have also been identified as mechanisms of secondary resistance in tumour 
samples from patients relapsing after EGFR-targeted therapies b ut in general, the acquisition of 
secondary mutations has not an est ablished role in resistance t o anti-EGFRs in mCRC.  
WT RAS tumours at baseline, after an in itial response, can develop res istance to anti-EGFR drugs 
shifting to mutated status and resulting in progression disease. This is due to the intratumoural heterogeneity that 
determines a  reduction or destruction of WT cells and a progressive proliferation 
of RAS-mutant clones. After a further line without anti-EGFR drugs, cells may regain sensitivity to 
cetuximab.  Based on these biological evidences some recent studies (such a s Cricket, E-Rechallenge and Santini 
studies) suggest that the reuse of cetuximab as continuation or  rechallenge, after progression to a

previous anti-EGFR containing regi men should be considered an e ffective and tolerable option in 
patients with a good performance st atus, in later line treatmen t (15-17, 36 ). 
The current study is designed in light of the fact that rationa l combination of cetuximab and the PI3K 
inhibitor MEN1611, in the setting described above should block each possible signalling cascade and 
represent an optimal approac h to overcome anti-EGFR therapy res istance. 
6.6 Investigational Medici nal Product: MEN1611 
6.6.1 Physical, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulatio n 
MEN1611 or 5-(7-Methylsulfonyl-2-m orpholin-4-yl-6,7-dihydro 5Hp yrrolo[2,3d]pyrimidin-4-
yl)pyrimidin-2-ylamine methanesulfonate ( molecular weight 473.5 3 g.mol-1) is a potent and 
selective Class I PI3K inhibitor with a novel structure. In par ticular, it has potent inhibitory activities 
against Class I PI3Kα. 
MEN1611 is yellow to greenish yellow powder or powder with lump s, stable in the solid state.  
The MEN1611 drug product is a hard capsule for oral administrat ion.  
6.6.2 Non-Clinical Data 
6.6.2.1 Non Clinical Pharmacology 
MEN1611 is a potent, selective Cl ass I PI3K inhibitor with a no vel structure. In cell-free assays, 
MEN1611 selectively inhibited Class I PI3Ks but showed less inhibition of Class II PI3Ks (C2α and C2β), Class III PI3K (Vps34) and PI3K-related protein kinases ( deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]-PK 
and mTOR). In in vitro anti-proliferation assays, MEN1611 exhib ited cell growth inhibition against 
a wide variety of cancer cells t hat are addicted to PI3K/AKT pa thway activation. Consistent with the 
in vitro anti-proliferation ac tivity, MEN1611 exhibited potent anti-tumour efficacy in a variety of 
human xenograft models with PI3K/ AKT pathway-activated tumours with daily oral administration. 
In the grafted tumours, a pharmacodynamic response was confirme d by the reduction of 
phosphorylated-v-akt (p-AKT). Moreover, in combination with cu rrent standard therapies, MEN16 11 showed significant 
enhancement of anti-tumour efficacy with good tolerability. The  potential combination agents with 
good compatibility include not only molecular targeted agents ( e.g. trastuzumab, erlotinib and 
bevacizumab) but also cytotoxic agents (e.g. cisplatin, temozolomide and paclitaxel). 
Moreover, the rat and cynomolgus monkey were chosen for in vivo  safety studies based on their 
similarity to human regarding th eir drug metabolism pattern in vitro and suitable kinetic data, 
including good oral bioavailabil ity and demonstration of pharma cological activity.

6.6.2.1.1 Mechanism of Action – in vitro 
In cell-free enzyme assays, MEN 1611 inhibited Class I PI3Ks, pa rticularly, PI3Kα and its mutants, 
with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 14 nmol/L (α), 6.7 nmol/L (α, E542K), 
6.7 nmol/L (α, E545K) and 5.6 nmol/L (α, H1047R). The effects o f MEN1611 on proliferation of 
cancer cells with activated PI3K/AKT pathways were investigated  demonstrating that MEN1611 
potently inhibited proliferation of cancer cells with PI3Kα mut ations at each of 3 hot spots, E542, 
E545 and H1047 and with PTEN gene tic inactivation. In agreement , MEN1611 significantly reduced 
phosphorylation of AKT, a key downstream mediator of PI3K, at t he T308 and S473 residues, in a 
dose-dependent manner. In addition, phosphorylation of downstre am factors, including proline rich 
AKT substrate 40, p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase , S6, GSK3β and FoxO1/3a, was also suppressed 
in MEN1611-treated cells, suggesting significant inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway by MEN1611. 
6.6.2.1.2 In vivo Studies 
Consistent with in vitro observations, MEN1611 also demonstrated potent anti-tumour efficacy in 
PI3K/AKT pathway-activated xenograft models. Daily oral adminis tration of MEN1611 significantly 
reduced volume of the grafted tum ours of a variety of tumour types with activated PI3K/AKT 
pathway including breast, ovaria n, prostate, endometrial and gastric cancers. 
Moreover, the therapeutic poten tial of MEN1611 in combination w ith current standar d therapeutics, 
including molecular targeted agents and cytotoxics was demonstr ated in the NCI-H292 (non-small 
cell lung cancer in combination wi th erlotinib), in the HCT116 model of colon cancer in combination 
with bevacizumab and in the SK- OV-3 ovarian cancer model in combination with paclitaxel.  
The antitumour efficacy of MEN1 611 in combination with cetuxima b was investigated in two 
xenografts models WT for KRAS and mutated in BRAF  (p.V600E), harboring mutations in the 
PIK3CA . MEN1611 alone and in combination with cetuximab showed a sign ificant tumour volume 
inhibition. The combination show ed significant tumour growth de lay. No toxic effects were observed 
in terms of body weight change and clinical signs.  The effect of MEN1611in CRC was further evaluated in a KRAS and PIK3CA  genetic background 
using two patient-derived x enografts, both harbouring a PIK3CA  mutation and a p.Q61H or p.G12D 
mutation in the KRAS gene. MEN1611 in combination with bevacizumab showed no synerg istic 
activity. The combination showed  growth delay only and no evide nce of long lasting anti-tumour 
activity.

6.6.2.3 Toxicology and Safety Studies 
Single-dose toxicity was evaluated in the safety pharmacology s tudies in rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys, and the in vivo micronucleus test in rats. Only slight  toxic effects on digestive system (loose 
stool and vomiting) were observe d at highest doses in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. 
In a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), 4-week, oral, repeat-dose toxicity study (dose levels: 0, 0.05, 
0.25, 1.25 and 6.25 mg/kg/day) in mature rats (14 weeks old at dose initiation), the key toxicological 
findings are classified into the following six groups: (1) Hype rglycaemia-related changes includes 
increases in glucose (blood and/or urinary glucose with and wit hout blood insulin) and hypertrophy 
of islet cells in the pancreas; (2) Effects on the lymphoid/hem atopoietic system, suc h as decreases in 
reticulocytes, lymphocytes and bone  marrow cells; (3) Effect on th e p i t u ita ry  g lan d ,  su ch  as  lo w  
pituitary weight and/or atrophy of the anterior lobe in the pit uitary gland; (4) Effects on the 
epithelium, such as thinning of  the epithelium in the tongue, e sophagus or cornea; (5) Effects on the 
reproductive organs, such as atrophy; (6) Inhibitory effects on  angiogenesis in the bone marrow, bone 
and ovaries. All the changes showed partial to complete recover y at the end of the 4-week Recovery 
Period. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was below 0.05 mg/kg/day and the MTD was 
6.25 mg/kg/day in the 4-week GLP study. 
In a GLP, 12-week, oral intermittent dose toxicity study (4 cycles; 2-weeks on followed by 1-week off/cycle, dose levels: 0, 0.05, 0.25, 1.25 and 6.25 mg/kg/day)  in mature rats (14 weeks old at dose 
initiation), the key findings mai nly reflected those described previously in the 4-week GLP study.  
The incidence/degree was lower compared with those observed in the 4-week GLP study. 
Additionally, there was an increase in incidence/degree of spontaneous inflammatory changes (mononuclear cell infiltration a nd inflammation, these changes were noted in the control group also) 
in the joint, lung, pancreas, harderian glands, tongue, large i ntestine and/or skin (mouth). The NOAEL 
was 0.05 mg/kg/day, and the MTD was 6.25 mg/kg/day in the 12-we ek intermittent dose GLP study.  
In a GLP 13-week oral repeat-dose toxicity study (dose levels: 0, 0.05, 0.25, and 1.25 m g/kg/day) in 
mature rats (14 weeks old at dos e initiation) study, the toxico logical profile was esse ntially similar to 
those of the 4-week and 12- week intermittent dose GLP studies in rats. The key findings mainly 
reflected those described as (1), (2), (3) and (6) in the 4-wee k GLP study. These adverse effects were 
partially or completely reversible at the end of the 4-week rec overy period, and therefore these 
findings were considered to be non-severe. The NOAEL was 0.05 mg/kg/day, and the MTD was 1.25 
mg/kg/day in the 13- week GLP study.

Repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys 
In a GLP, 4-week, oral repeat-dose toxicity study (dose levels:  0, 0.032, 0.16, 0.8 and 4/2 mg/kg/day) 
in mature cynomolgus monkeys (4 to  6 years old at dose initiati on), 4 animals receiving 4 mg/kg/day 
(2 of each sex) were sacrificed in extremis (on Days 15, 18, 21  and 28 respectively). As a result, the 
highest dose of 4 mg/kg/day was  reduced to 2 mg/kg/day from the  3rd week of the dosing period. The 
key findings observed in this study mainly reflected those desc ribed 4-week GLP rat study. Additional 
changes seen in cynomolgus monkeys were atrophy of the gastric gland. All the changes showed 
complete recovery at the end of  the 4-week recovery period. The  NOAEL was 0.16 mg/kg/day and 
the MTD was 0.8 mg/kg/day in the 4-week GLP study. 
In a GLP, 12-week, oral intermittent dose toxicity study (4 cycles; 2-weeks on followed by 1-week off/cycle, dose levels: 0, 0.12, 0.6 and 3/1.5 mg/kg/day) in ma ture cynomolgus monkeys (4 to 7 years 
old at dose initiation), marked  body weight loss was observed i n the highest dose gr oup. As a result, 
the highest dose of 3 mg/kg/da y was reduced to 1.5 mg/kg/day fr om the 3rd-cycle. The key findings 
observed in this study mainly reflected those described as (1),  (2) and (5) in the 4-week GLP rat study. 
The incidence of these findings i n the 12-week intermittent dos e GLP study was lower compared with 
those observed in the 4-week GLP study. The NOAEL was 0.12 mg/kg/day and t he MTD was 1.5 mg/kg/day in the 12-week intermittent dose 
GLP study. There was no evidence of genotoxic liability for MEN 1611 in the Ames, chromosome 
aberration, or in vivo rat micronucleus tests.  
There were no effects on the cen tral nervous and respiratory sy stems in safety pharmacology studies 
in rats up to 45 mg/kg, by the oral route. The cardiovascular s afety pharmacology studies, including 
in vitro human Ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay and an i n vivo telemetry study in 
cynomolgus monkeys, indicated no QT prolongation risk up to 10 μmol/L (the hERG assay) and up 
to 9 mg/kg (the initial monkey telemetry study by the oral rout e). However, transient hypertension 
(approximately 20 mmHg increase compared to the predose values)  was observed at 0.5 mg/kg and 
above in the monkey telemetry study by the oral route. However,  transient hypertension (approx. 
20 mmHg increase compared to the pre-dose values) was observed at 0.5 mg/Kg and above in the 
monkey telemetry study by the oral route. In a further telemetr y study with 2-week repeat dose oral 
administration at 1.5 mg/kg/day, similar transi ent hypertension  was observed, but, these findings did 
not worsen with repeated adminis tration. In order to achieve hi gh systemic exposure, a telemetry 
study in cynomolgus monkey was conducted using the intravenous (IV) route, and this confirmed 
similar transient hypertension at 1 and 3 mg/kg; however, this IV study confirmed that no QT 
prolongation up to 10 mg/kg. Potential effects of MEN1611 on reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been evaluated 
in a standard reproductive toxicity study. However, it is consi dered that the atrophic changes in the

reproductive organs in both species used in the repeat dose tox icity studies are indicative of possible 
effects on reproductive and de velopmental toxicity. 
As the observed adverse effects following repeated administrati on were completely or partially 
reversible, they were not considered to pose a significant risk  to human patients receiving oral 
administration in a well-controlled and a well-monitored clinic al setting. The effects of MEN1611 on 
pregnancy and embryo-fetal devel opment in the rat following ora l administration were investigated 
in a preliminary non-GLP study. Six females/group were dosed fr om Day 6 until Day 17 post-coitum 
at dose levels of 0.25, 1.25 and 6.25 mg/kg/day. The dose level of 6.25 mg/kg/day presented signs of 
maternal, fetal, and embryo-toxicity. Females treated at dose l evels of 0.25 mg/kg/day and 1.25 
mg/kg/day did not show any cha nge both during the pregnancy and  at post mortem examination. No 
external alterations were observe d also on fetuses. However, ev en if maternal toxicity has not been 
observed at these lower dose levels, a possible teratogenic eff ect cannot be excluded since no visceral 
and skeletal examinations of fetuses was performed. 
6.6.3 Clinical Experience 
In the PA-001 EU dose-escalation first-in-human (FIH) study, co nducted by Chugai Pharmaceutical, 
MEN1611 was administered to patients with advanced solid tumour s for which there was no standard 
treatment available. The study w as conducted in 4 clinical cent res from August 2010 until 
December 2012.  Of the 39 patients enrolled in PA-001 EU study, 38 patients wer e included in the safety population. 
MEN1611 was generally well tolerated and the majority of adverse events (AEs) and drug-related AEs were Grade 1 or 2 and reversible. The most common drug-rela ted AEs (≥20% in total) were 
diarrhoea (34%), nausea (32%),  fatigue (29%), stomatitis (26%) and decreased appetite (21%). The 
commonly reported Grade ≥3 AEs (≥10% in total) were anaemia (21 %), diarrhoea (16%) and 
hyperglycaemia (13%). These events were restored when MEN1611 d ose was decreased and/or 
discontinued. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported in 1/7 patients in the 48 mg twice daily (BID) cohort 
( a s p a r t a t e  a m i n o t r a n s f e r a s e  [ A S T ]  i n c r e a s e d ) ,  2 / 3  p a t i e n t s  i n  t he 72 mg BID cohort (fatigue and 
encephalopathy) and 2/5 patients in the 56 mg BID cohort (diarr hoea and mucosal inflammation). 
MEN1611 was well tolerated up to total daily doses of 96 mg whe n administrated once daily (QD) 
or BID. The MTD of MEN1611 was determined to be 48 mg BID. No d eaths due to AEs were 
reported in this study. AEs leadin g to discontinuation of study  treatment and AEs leading to 
modification of study treatme nt were reported in 8/38 and 13/38  patients, respectively.  
At single and repeated doses, MEN1611 was absorbed and eliminat ed rapidly, with a low contribution 
of renal excretion on its total elimination. MEN1611 exposure A UC and C
max was subject to large

variability. In QD cohorts there was no clear evidence of accum ulation, whereas a potential for 
MEN1611 accumulation was observed in the BID regimen. After QD administration, saturation of 
exposure was observed in 56 to 96 mg dose range at single dose and 32 to 96 mg dose range at repeat 
dose, suggesting that MEN1611 exhibits non-linear PK at these d oses.  
Decreases in percent change from baseline for p-AKT in platelet -rich plasma (PRP), as a proof of 
mechanism for MEN1611, were obser ved for daily doses greater th an 32 mg, after both single and 
repeat dose administration. The temporal relationship between reduction in phosphorylation of AKT 
and dosing administration suggested  target engagement for less than 24 hours, indic ating the need to 
increase dosing frequency to BID. Inhibition of p-AKT was also observed in 2 of the 3 tumour biopsy 
samples obtained in the study: D ecreases of p-AKT from baseline  was observed in one patient both 
in the 96 mg QD cohort (-81%) and in the 56 mg BID cohort (-48. 5%) while one patient in the 56 mg 
QD cohort had an increased p-AKT compared to baseline (+37.0%).  
No patients had the best overall r esponse of complete response (CR) or partial res ponse (PR). Stable 
disease (SD) was reported in 8/ 33 (24.2%) patients in total. Al though there were no patients who 
showed CR or PR, ≥ 30% decreases of standardised uptake value w ere reported in 4/23 patients in 
the 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose- positron emission tomography ima ging after 1 week of treatment 
(Cycle 1, Day 8). One patient with mCRC treated at 96 mg dose, had a SD for more than 16 weeks.  MEN1611-01 (B-PRECISE-01) is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib dose escalation study of 
MEN1611 combined with trastuzumab +/-fulvestrant, in patients wi th PIK3CA mutated HER2-
positive locally recurrent unresectable (advanced) or metastati c (a/m) breast cancer progressed to 
anti-HER2 based therapy. The study involves patients pre-treate d with at least 2 lines of anti HER2 
based therapy. The study is aime d to determine the MTD and RP2D  of MEN1611 (at three ascending 
doses 16mg, 32mg and 48mg) when ad ministered in combination wit h trastuzumab+/-fulvestrant. 
After completing the dose escalation phase, the 48 mg BID dose had been selected as RP2D and 
subsequently, the cohort expansion phase has been opened in two groups of patients: 1) MEN1611 plus trastuzumab and fulvestrant in HER2, hormone receptor posi tive postmenopausal women and 2) 
MEN1611 plus trastuzumab in HER2 positive patients, hormone rec eptor negative men and women 
and premenopausal women. The study recruitment started in July 2018 (first patient pre-s creened) and was closed in December 
2021. A total of 62 patients have been treated in the study, 56  of them at the RP2D of 48 mg BID: 31 
in the triple and 25 in the double combo arms with MEN1611 bein g well tolerated. As of 15 May2023, 
three patients continue on tre atment and are under follow up fo r safety and efficacy.

6.7 Risk Benefit Assessment 
Treatment options for patients with RAS WT, PI3K mutated mCRC after progression with standard 
chemo- and targeted therapy including anti-EGFR containing regimens remain poor. The 
PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR signalling pathway, which cont rols numerous cellular 
functions, is frequently dere gulated in these tumours. 
Hyperactivation of the PI3K cascade is one of the principal mec hanisms of resistance involved in the 
lack of response to a nti-EGFR antibodies. 
Because PI3K is the most proximal component of the pathway, tar geting PI3K itself rather than AKT 
or mTOR might induce a pronounced inhibition of the downstream components and reverse eventual 
resistance to previous treatment s. A number of PI3K inhibitors are under clinical investigation in 
different type of tumours, incl uding pan-PI3K inhibitors target ing all four isoforms of class I PI3K 
(e.g. buparlisib, pictilisib), as well as isoform-selective inh ibitors, especially PI3Kα inhibitors, such 
as taselisib and alpelisib. Cons idering the high frequency of t oxicity of pan-PI3K i nhibitors, some of 
them have been discontinued desp ite the evidence of clinical ac tivity, mostly in combination (i.e. 
buparlisib).  MEN1611 is a potent, selective class I PI3K inhibitor with a strong inhibitory activity against PI3Kα which has shown cytotoxic activity in in vitro and in vivo mode ls as single agent and in combination. 
Moreover, in the FIH study conducted by Chugai Pharmaceutical, MEN1611 has shown a good safety 
profile, in line with the class of agent, furthermore an encour aging anti-tumour activity, resulting in 
disease stabilization in 24% of treated patients, has been obse rved (PA-001 EU Clinical Study 
Report). Therefore, given the lack  of standard therapeutic opti ons for the selected patient population, 
the pharmacological properties and acceptable toxicological pro file shown in preclinical and clinical 
studies, the risk-benefit assessm ent is considered favourable i n the context of the clinical study.  
Considering the above, the intent  is exploring th e safety and activity of MEN1611 plus cetuximab in 
patients with PIK3CA  mutated, RAS WT mCRC progressed over at least two previous lines of 
irinotecan, oxaliplatin, 5-FU and anti-EGFR antibodies-containing regimens. If this study demonstrates an efficacy signal, MEN1611 could offer a new ther apeutic approach in the treatment 
of this setting.  In this study, MEN1611 treatment will be continued until object ive disease progression is 
documented or another criterion for discontinuation (e.g. unacc eptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent) is met, for patients affected by mCRC. To mitigate the  risk of the administration of the study 
treatment and to guarantee the patients’ safety during the stud y participation, the following measures 
have been applied in accordance with European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines ( 37):

1) It was decided to consider a sta rting dose of 48 mg BID according to the data inc luded in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB), it being the MTD in the FIH study . The 48 mg given BID offered 
a good safety profile, as MEN1611 was well tolerated and succes sfully inhibited the PI3K 
pathway.  
2) Although MEN1611 did not show to induce any mood disorder in th e clinical studies up to 
date, patients having any serious  and/or unstable pre-existing psychiatric or neurologic illness 
or other conditions that could in terfere with patient's safety are to be excluded, considering 
the toxicity profile of the class of drug (i.e. buparlisib).  
3) MEN1611 as other PI3K inhibitors  are reported to cause hypergly caemia; for this reason, 
patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (glycated haemoglo bin [HbA1c] > 7%) and 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 126 mg/dL will not be included i n the study; a strict 
monitoring of safety laboratory te sts including blood sugar lev els as well as recording of any 
AEs will be done at each visit a nd appropriate therapy will be started immediately at 
occurrence. 
4) Pre-clinical study showed effects on the lymphoid/hematopoietic  system, such as decreases 
in reticulocytes, lymphocytes and bone marrow cells; for this r eason, a strict monitoring of 
safety laboratory test includi ng haematology as well as recordi ng of any AEs will be done at 
each visit and appropriate supportiv e care will be started imme diately. In the B-PRECISE-01 
(as of 30 January 2023) at the 48 mg BID dose (n=58), 20 (35.71 %) patients had TEAEs in 
the SOC Blood and Lymphatic Syst em Disorders (regardless of cau sality): 19 (33.9%) 
anaemia, 18 (32.14%) leukopenia, 5 (8.93%) neutropenia, 5 (8.93%) thrombocytopenia, and 
2 (3.57%) lymphopenia. Out of them, 6 (10.71%) were of CTCAE (v 4.03) ≥ grade 3 severity, 
4 (7.14%) anaemia, with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurring to one patient (1.79 %) 
each.  
5) Diarrhoea is a class toxi city of PI3K inhibitors ( 38). In the FIH Chugai Pharmaceutical study 
(PA-001EU), one of the most common side effects was gastrointes tinal disorders. In the B-
PRECISE-01 (as of 30 January 2023) at the 48 mg BID dose, 37 (6 6.1%) patients had 
diarrhoea (regardless of causa lity), it was of CTCAE (v4.03) ≥ grade 3 severity in 6 (10.7%) 
patients. Furthermore, diarrhoea is associated with the use of cetuximab and itis a frequent 
symptom associated with tumour. We have clearly stated in the e xclusion criteria that National

v5.0) Grade ≥ 2 diarrhoea, which is not resolved in the week pr ior to the start of treatment, 
will be considered an exclusion criterion. Physical examination  and laboratory tests will be 
performed at each visit and appropriate supportive care will be  started immediately at 
occurrence as per investigator judgement. 
6) Considering the toxicity profile of the class of PI3K inhibitors, preliminary data from B-
PRECISE-01 study (as of 30 January 2023) at the 48 mg BID dose,  shows 32 (57.14%) 
patients had TEAEs in the SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (regardless of causality), it was of CTCAE (v4.03) ≥ grade 3 severity in 2 (3. 6%) patients. Based on that, 
the combination of MEN1611 with cetuximab, cutaneous reaction is considered a potential 
risk for the patients.  The most frequent cutaneous toxic  effects reported in clinical studies with PI3K inhibitors 
have been maculopapular eruption, pruritus, and dry skin. In th e B-PRECISE-01 study the 
most common TEAEs were rash in 15 (26.8%) and pruritus in 6 (10 .71%) patients. For this 
reason a complete clinical examination including skin will be p erformed at screening and 
throughout the study at each study visit.  In addition, due to the known cet uximab skin toxicity, patients  will receive general 
educational and prophylactic measures (see Section 8.4.6). Consultation with a dermatologist 
shall be performed in case skin toxicity Grade ≥ 3 is assessed (the AE has to be followed until 
resolution to Grade 1). The frequency of dermatological visits can be increased upon 
Investigator’s judgement. 
7) As highlighted above, no AE due to drug phototoxicity was repor ted in the FIH study. In the 
B-PRECISE-01 study (as of 30 January 2023) at the 48 mg BID dos e, 10 (17.9%) patients 
had TEAEs in the SOC Eye Disord ers, all of them were CTCAE v4.03 grade 1 or 2 severity, 
the most common were : dry eye in 4 (7.1%%),  blepharitis in 3 (5 .4%) and vision blurred in 2 
(3.6%). Considering the eye toxi city associated with cetuximab,  we want to exclude any 
potential risk for the patients under treatment with the combin ation. Patients will receive 
complete physical examination at  each cycle including eyes. Oph thalmic visits shall be 
performed for any Grade ≥ 2 eye disorder and repeated bi-weekly  until resolution to Grade 1 
(the frequency can be increase d upon Investigator’s judgement).

8) Respiratory disorders including fatal cases have been reported in patients treated within the 
EGFR-pathway (both cetuxima b and PI3K inhibitors) ( 38). Confounding or contributing 
factors, such as concomitant chemotherapy known to be associate d with interstitial lung 
disease (ILD), and pre-existing pulmonary diseases were frequen t in fatal cases. Patients with 
known active or uncontrolled pulmonary dysfunction are excluded  from this study. Patients 
enrolled will be regularly questioned about pulmonary symptoms during the study. Should 
pulmonary symptoms appear during or after cetuximab treatment, a detailed description is 
required and investigators shoul d use their discretion in order ing such diagnostic procedures 
as are necessary to elicit an accurate diagnosis. If pneumonitis/ILD is diagnosed, cetuximab 
and MEN1611 must be discontinued and the patient be treated app ropriately. 
9) MEN1611 affected the blood pressu re (BP), with transient hypertension (approx. 20 mmHg 
compared to the pre-dose values) in telemetered cynomolgus monk eys from 2 to 6 hours after 
dosing at 0.5, 1.5, 3.7 and 9 mg/kg, but with no effects on other parameters of the 
cardiovascular system. In the B-P RECISE-01 study, (as of 30 January 2023) at the 48 mg BID 
dose, 5 (8.9%) patients had hypertension (regardless of causali ty), most of them were CTCAE 
v4.03 grade 1 or 2 severity, and 1 of them of grade 3. A strict monitoring of safety includes vital sign and BP measurement. Therefore, to prevent such poten tial risks, patients with 
uncontrolled hypertension (define d as persistent BP of ≥ 150/90  mmHg despite treatment, 
measured on at least 2 separate  occasions) will be not included  in the study.  
10) As far as treatment with cetuximab is concerned, in order to mi tigate the potential risk of 
severe and infusion reactions, for the first administration, pa tients will be monitored during 
cetuximab infusion and for at least 1 hour after end of the inf usion. In order to mitigate the 
potential risk of severe and fast progressing infusion reaction s, premedication including a 
corticosteroid and a histamine-1 (H1) receptor antagonist (e.g.  d-chlorpheniramine or 
diphenhydramine) is recommended. Availability of resuscitation equipment must be ensured. 
In addition, patients will be in formed about the possibility of  such a late onset and instructed 
to contact the physician if symptoms or signs of an infusion-re lated reaction occur (see Section 
8.4.5). 
11) The potential for DDI between MEN1611 and cetuximab is relative ly low; indeed, 
considering the pathways involved in the elimination of a small  molecule (e.g. renal and

metabolism, immunog enicity, Fc receptors, target mediated clear ance), most of the possible 
DDI mechanisms can be ruled out in the case of MEN1611 and cetu ximab. Nevertheless, 
MEN1611 PK will be characterized i n combination with cetuximab and compared with 
MEN1611 PK as single agent, to assess any potential interaction . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
6.7.1 Risk Benefit Assessment for COVID-19 Pandemic 
There is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel 
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that was first detected in Wuhan City, H ubei Province, China in 2019. This 
new virus has rapidly spread acr oss the globe causing the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
declare a pandemic situation on March 12, 2020. In response to the pandemic, the health authorities 
have issued recommendations on the further conduct of clinical studies. Accordingly, risk 
assessments of involvement in the trial with added challenges d ue to COVID-19 and mitigation 
measures need to be taken into consideration in all clinical studies to protect patients, site staff and the society as a whole. This is a phase Ib/II clinical trial for heavily pre-treated pa tients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
with few tolerable and efficacious  therapeutic available option s as per standard of care. The eligibility 
of patients to the study will be evaluated by the treating phys ician/PI/sub-investigator after individual 
assessment that the clinical benefit of the investigational products will outweigh the risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 infec tion without compromising the s afety of the patients and care 
providers. Measures to mitigate the additional risks caused by COVID-19 ar e:

 Current national laws and local  recommendations for prevention of pandemic will be strictly 
adhered. 
 Patients will be encouraged to fo llow strictly local mitigation  recommendations when 
ambulatory (e.g. social dist ancing, use of m ask, etc.). 
 Access to Clinical site will be  as per local COVID-19 control m easures. 
 Based on the local circumsta nces, to be reassessed on an ongoin g basis, additional measures 
will be considered for imp lementation including: 
o Interruption or slowing down of recruitment of new trial partic ipants;  
o Postponement of activation of sites  that have not yet been init iated; 
o Transfer of trial participants to investigational sites away from risk zones, or closer to 
their home; 
o re-distribution among sites, i n case of shortage of study drug; 
o Increase of IMP kits dispensati on during the site visits to cover longer periods of time 
and/or distribution of IMP t o study participant’s home; 
o Cetuximab administration to be pe rformed at local outpatient fa cilities closer to 
participants’ home, in case the trial participants cannot reach  the site; 
o Safety laboratory tests to be performed at local laboratory or participant’s home, in case the trial participants cannot reach the site; 
o Remote consent could be collected  (when applicable as per site policy).

also be discontinued from the study treatment at the Investigat or’s discretion or at specific Sponsor’s 
request at any time. 
8.2.3.1 Withdrawal from the Study 
The reasons for protocol-specified patient withdrawal are liste d below: 
 Informed consent withdrawn or the  patient requests discontinuation from the study. 
 Any medical condition or personal circumstance which, in the op inion of the Investigator or 
the Sponsor, exposes the patient to risk by continuing in the s tudy or does not allow the patient 
to adhere to the requirements of the protocol. 
 Death. 
8.2.3.2 Withdrawal from the Study Treatment 
Patients will be withdrawn from the study treatment if they exp erience: 
 Any protocol deviation which in the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor exposes the 
patient to risk by contin uing the treatment. 
 Any medical condition or personal circumstance or AE with a pos sible, probable or certain 
drug-causality as per Investigator’s judgement which exposes the patient to risk by continuing the treatment. 
 Disease progression. 
 Delay in scheduled treatment exceeding 21 days due to study dru g related toxicity. 
 Occurrence of pregnancy. 
 Patient’s request. 
All patients shall undergo the End of Study Visit at the time o f study withdrawal or discontinuation 
of the study treatment. Unschedul ed assessments showing disease  progression and leading to patient’s 
withdrawal can replace the End of Study Visit provided that all assessments/procedures scheduled for this visit are completed.  
If a patient prematurely terminates the study as per patient’s request, data already collected will be 
used and analysed for the purpose  of the study, as per local re gulation.

with cetuximab will represent the toxic dose level for this com bination, a lower dose level of 32 mg 
BID will be tested in cohort 2. 
In this Phase, MEN1611 will be administered as below: 
 Cohort 1: MEN1611 48 mg (3 × 16 mg) capsules BID over 28-days’ cycle.  
 Cohort 2: MEN1611 32 mg (2 × 16 mg) capsules BID over 28-days’ cycle.  
 Step 2 (Cohort-expansion Phase):  MEN1611 as oral capsules will be orally administered BID for a 
continuous 28-days’ cycle at the  RP2D as established in Step 1.  
MEN1611 capsules should be taken with a glass of water in fasti ng condition, i.e. at least 2 hours 
after a meal and at least 1 hour before the next meal. Patient should take capsules at approximately the same time each day. At Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 4 of Cycl e 1, and at each following visits, 
MEN1611 will be administered at si te using the new boxes dispen sed at each visit.  
8.4.2 Cetuximab 
In both Step 1 and Step 2, cetuximab will be administered IV we ekly on Day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of every 
28-day cycle according to institutional standards.  The initial cetuximab dose is 400 mg/m
2 administered as a 120 minutes infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 
followed by a weekly 250 mg/m2 dose administered as  a 60-minute IV infusion. Premedication wi th 
a H1 receptor antagonist (e.g. d-chlorpheniramine or diphenhydr amine) and a corticosteroid is 
required prior to cetuximab a dministration (see Section 8.4.8 ). Management of infusion reactions due 
to cetuximab are to be managed according to Section 8.4.5. 
MEN1611 will be given in combination with weekly IV infusion of  cetuximab until objective disease 
progression is documented or anot her criterion for discontinuat ion is met. If cetuximab needs to be 
discontinued due to toxicity, continuation with MEN1611 as mono therapy should be considered and 
discussed with the Sponsor.

8.4.5 Management of Infusion-Related  Reactions due to Cetuximab 
One of the main undesirable effe cts of cetuximab are infusion-r elated reactions, which occur with 
mild to moderate symptoms in more than 10% of patients and with  severe symptoms in more than 
1% of patients. 
Prophylaxis of Infusion-Related Reactions: 
At least 1 hour prior to the first infusion of cetuximab, the p atient must receive a premedication 
consisting of a corticosteroid and a H1 receptor antagonist.  This premedication is strongly recommended prior to all subsequ ent infusions. 
As dexamethasone and prednisone are known to be inducers of iso zyme CYP3A4, its administration 
during the study is allowed only prior to cetuximab infusions. In case the patient was receiving dexamethasone/prednisone befor e the study, the treatment should  be stopped within a period 
corresponding to five times the ha lf-life of the drug prior to the first MEN1611 ad ministration (see 
Section 8.4.8 ). 
Cetuximab must be administered u nder the supervis ion of a physi cian experienced in the use of 
antineoplastic medicinal products. The infusion rate should be consistent with the local label but 
should not exceed 10 mg/min. Close monitoring is required durin g the infusion and for at least one 
hour after end of the infusion. If an infusion reaction occurs while cetuximab is being administered, 
the infusion should be stopped im mediately, and the patients should be closely monitored and treated 
in line with institutional standards. Availability of resuscita tion equipment must be ensured. 
Symptoms may occur during the fi rst infusion and for up to several hours afterwards or with 
subsequent infusions. It is reco mmended to inform patients of t he possibility of such a late onset and 
inform them to contact the inves tigator if symptoms or signs of  an infusion-related reaction occur. 
Occurrence of a severe infusion-related reaction requires immed iate and permanent discontinuation 
of cetuximab therapy and may nece ssitate emergency treatment. 
If during the first i nfusion, an infusion-related reaction occu rs within the first 15 minutes, the infusion 
should be stopped. If an infusion-related reaction develops lat er during the infusion or at a subsequent 
infusion further management will depend on its severity:

d. Decrease cetuximab in fusion rate by 50% and 
monitor closely for any wo rsening. All subsequent 
infusions must also be admin istered at the reduced 
rate. 
Grade 2: Therapy or infusion int erruption indicated 
but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g. antihis tamines, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for <=24 hrs. Stop cetuximab infusion. A dminister symptomatic 
treatment as medically indicated. Restart and complete the infusion at the discretion of the investigator. The infusi on must be resumed at 
reduced rate (once resolv ed or decreased to Grade 1). 
Additional premedications such as antihistamines or low-dose systemic corticosteroids may be administered when the infusion is restarted and monitored closely for any w orsening. All subsequent 
infusions must also be admin istered at the reduced 
rate. 
Grade 3:  Prolonged (e.g. not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infus ion); recurrence of 
symptoms following i nitial improvement; 
hospitalisation indicated for clinical sequelae. Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicate
d. Stop infusion immediate ly, treat symptoms 
vigorously (e.g. adminis ter epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, intravenous fluids, vasopressor agents, oxygen etc., as medical indicated). Permanently discontinue cetuximab. 
Once a cetuximab infusion rate has been decreased due to an inf usion reaction, it will be administered 
at the reduced rate for all subs equent infusions. Any rechallen ge with cetuximab following an infusion 
reaction should be discussed with the Sponsor.

8.4.6 Management of Skin Toxici ties due to Cetuximab 
The main undesirable effects of c etuximab are skin reactions, which occur in more than 80% of patients. Clinical judgement and  experience of the 
investigator should guide the management plan of each patient.  
General educational and prophylactic measures: Washing with luk ewarm water, use shower oil or soap with neutral pH, use only p erfume free cream, 
sunlight protection factor (SPF) ≥25, wearing sun-protective clo thes, application of topical agents (e. g. sunscreen, vitK1, em ollient creams, topical 
steroids) in some areas such as face, scalp, neck, upper chest and upper back. Prophylactic recommendations should follow the clinical practice and 
local regulations for cetuximab administration. 
In symptomatic patients who develop skin toxicity it is recommended to receive antihistamine for pruritic lesions, silver nitr ate or zinc oxide cream 
for fissuring and emollie nts for desquamation.

If a patient experiences Grade 3 skin toxicity, cetuximab therapy may be deferred, without changing 
the dose level. If the toxicity resolves to Grade 2 or less by the following treatment period, the 
treatment may resume. With the s econd or third recurrences of G rade 3 skin toxicity, cetuximab 
therapy may again be deferred with concomitant dose reduction t o 200 mg/m2 and 150 mg/m2, 
respectively. Cetuximab dose redu ctions are permanent. Patients  should discontinue cetuximab if not 
resolved to Grade 2 or a fourth occurrence of Grade 3 skin toxicity occurs despite an appropriate dose 
reduction. 
8.4.7 Management of Other Cetuximab-Related Adverse Events 
Diarrhoea 
Patients and patient’s caregivers should be carefully informed of possible severe toxic effects such as 
diarrhoea and abdomin al cramps. Each patient should be instruct ed to have loperamide readily 
available and to begin treatment at the first episode of poorly  formed or loose stools or the earliest 
onset of bowel movements more f requent than normally expected. The patient should be also 
instructed to notify the Inves tigator if diarrhoea or abdominal  c r a m p s  o c c u r .  P a t i e n t s  s h o u l d  b e  
supported as clinically indicated a nd treated for diarrhoea as per institutional guidelines, and/or as 
indicated in the locally approved prescribing information. 
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
Respiratory disorders, cases of ILD, including fatal cases, hav e been reported in patients treated with 
the EGFR-pathway. C onfounding or contributin g factors, such as concomitant chemotherapy known 
to be associated with ILD, and pre-existing pulmonary diseases were frequent in fatal cases. Patients 
with known active or u ncontrolled pulmonary dysfunction are excluded from the stu dy. Patients will 
be regularly questioned about pu lmonary symptoms during the stu dy. Should pulmonary symptoms 
appear during or after cetuximab treatment, a detailed description is required and investigators should 
use their discretion in orderin g such diagnostic procedures as are necessary to elicit an accurate 
diagnosis. If ILD/ pneumonitis is  diagnosed, cetuximab and MEN1 611 must be discontinued and the 
patient be treated appropriately. 
Electrolyte Disturbances 
Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels occur frequentl y and may lead to severe 
hypomagnesaemia in some patients.  Hypomagnesaemia is reversible  following discontinuation of 
cetuximab. If hypomagnesaemia is present, replacement should be  m a n a g e d  w i t h  e i t h e r  o r a l  o r  
parental replacement or both, according to institutional practi ce. It is recommended that patient’s 
serum magnesium leve l should be maintained within the normal ra nge during study treatment.

I n  a d d i t i o n ,  a  p a t i e n t ’ s  s e r u m  p o t assium and calcium (adjusted for albumin) parameters are 
recommended to be maintained as p er local medi cal practice. 
Eye disorders 
Cetuximab should be used with cau tion in patients with a histor y of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis or 
severe dry eye. Being a risk factor for keratitis and ulceratio n, the use of contact lens should be 
avoided. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute or 
worsening: Eye inflammation, la crimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye 
should be referred promptly to an ophthalmology specialist. Any  ocular disorder Grade ≥2 will be 
referred to an ophthalmology specialist until resolution to Gra de 1 (or even more frequently, if 
indicated). If a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed , treatment with cetuximab should be 
interrupted or discontinued. If keratitis is diagnosed, the ben efits and risks of continuing treatment 
should be considered according investigator and sponsor judgement.  All other cetuximab-related AEs will be managed according to in formation provided in the SmPC 
and local hospital guidelines. 
8.4.8 Prohibited and Concomitant Medications 
During the study patients are not allowed to receive any chroni c treatment with steroids or another 
immunosuppressive agent. Premedi cation using a corticosteroid a nd a H1 receptor antagonist 
(including but not limited to d-c hlorpheniramine or diphenhydra mine) is allowed. Corticosteroids can 
be used only as premedication. Any chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic treatme nt, and endocrine therapy are not 
allowed during the study and with in 28 days or within five time s the half-life of the investigational 
agent, whichever is longer of the first administration of any s tudy treatment (Day 1 of Cycle 1). 
Patients may receive palliative radiotherapy for painful bone m etastases, as long as ≤ 25% of the bone 
marrow was irradiated and does  not affect target and non-target  lesions being assessed. Patients may 
also receive bisphosphonates for the treatment of bone metastas es.  
 
  
  
Within 28 days or within five times the half-life of the invest igational agent, whichever is longer prior 
to Screening Visit no other inve stigational agent is allowed to  be taken. 
Concomitant and prior (i.e. within  28 days before Screening) me dications shall be carefully checked 
since the use of the above reported medications may represent a n exclusion criterion making the patient

medication has to be recorded starting from Scr eening until the  End of Study Visit. 
8.4.9 Dietary and Lifestyle Restrictions 
No food and drink containing grapefruit and quinine-containing products (e.g. tonic water) may be 
consumed from at least 2 weeks before the first administration of MEN1611, throughout the study and 
until the End of Study Visit.  Alcohol consumption must be avoi ded from 48 hours before and du ring any study visit. Patients should 
not consume more than 3 units per day during the off-site days during the study (1 unit = 200 mL beer 
or 100 mL wine or 25 m L distilled spirits). 
8.5 Study Procedures and Assessments 
8.5.1 Study Procedures 
The study procedures are depicte d in the study flow chart (see Section 2.2) and summarised below by 
Pre-screening Period, Screening Period, and 28-day treatment cy cles, each requiring 4-weekly study 
visits until the End of Study Vis it. After the End of Study Vis it, all patients evaluable for efficacy will 
be followed for survival status according to local practice (a visit or a telephone ca ll) every 12 weeks up 
to the end of study. 
Pre-screening Period: 
At the Pre-screening Visit, all pre-screening eligible patients  will perform mutational analysis for 
PIK3CA , BRAF  and N-K-RAS in plasma (ctDNA centrally analysed) following provision of th e 
written pre-screening informed consent. Inclusion into the study will be done based on the results of the ctDNA.  
Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1): 
During the 28 days prior to the first dose of MEN1611 and follo wing provision of written informed 
consent, each patient will be  screened for eligibility. 
Patients entering the screening period with pre-screening ctDNA test older than 3 months need 
to be centrally re-tested for PIK3CA, N-K-RAS  and BRAF in plasma.  
 The following procedures will be  performed at Screening: 
 Check of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 Recording of demographic data. 
 Standard medical, surgic al and medica tion history.

8.5.2 Sample Handling and Shipping Management  
In order to perform PK, genetic, exploratory  
 and 
safety analyses, a whole blood volume ranging between 15 and 44  mL, with a maxi mum amount of 
approximately 62 mL (only at Visit 1 of Cycle 3), needs to be c ollected per visit. 
Other than safety samples that w ill be locally analysed, biolog ical samples will be processed at site and 
analysed centrally. All biological samples except safety blood samples collected along the study will 
be stored for a maximum of 10 ye ars from the date of the Last P atient Last Visit. After 10 years, the 
samples will be destroyed (for further details, please refer to  the Laboratory Manual). 
8.5.3  
MEN1611 plasma concentration-time data 
will be analysed using a  population PK approach. A 
nonlinear mixed effects model will be used to determine populat ion PK parameters and their 
associated variabilities (e.g. apparent systemic clearance [CL/ F], V/F, Ka).

Individual PK parameters (e.g. AUC, C max) will be estimated usi ng a post hoc analysis. 
The modelling strategy is detaile d in the PK Data Analysis Plan  (DAP). 
Leftover PK sample aliquots could be analysed to further elucid ate in-vivo metabolic 
biotransformation of MEN1611. 
8.5.4 Safety Assessment 
Safety and tolerabilit y endpoints will be derived from the foll owing measurements/evaluations: 
 Incidence, severity as per CTCAE v5.0 grading, seriousness and treatment-causality of 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs). 
 Frequency of clinically significant abnormalities in: 
- Physical examination and vital signs. 
- Safety laboratory tests. 
- 12-lead ECG record. 
- Urinalysis. 
8.5.4.1 Medical History 
Complete medical history will be collected during the Screening  Period in order to obtain all 
information necessary to conf irm the study inclusion and exclus ion criteria. 
General medical history shall include all the diseases (excludi ng CRC) and conditions, either chronic 
or not, which are needed to assess the compliance with inclusio n/exclusion criteri a and those which 
are relevant according to the Investigator. 
The CRC specific medical history will include: date of onset of  primary tumour, sidedness, histology, 
date of diagnosis of metastatic disease, histology of the metas tasis if available, number and type of 
previous treatments and duration of the response to the last tr eatment. 
General medical histo ry shall be collecte d starting from 28 days prior to Screening. 
CRC specific medical history shall be collected starting from t he primary CRC onset date. 
8.5.4.2 Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
A complete physical examination (including also neurological ex amination) will be performed at 
Screening and throughout the study at each study visit; it will  include a general appearance observation 
and a complete examination of th e following body systems/areas:  Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat 
(HEENT)/Neck, Lymph Nodes, Thyro id, Abdomen, Skin, Cardiovascul ar, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, 
Neurological and  Musculoskeletal/Extremities.

Vital signs will be recorded throughout the  study at each study  visit from Screening to End of Study 
Visit. The following param eters will be measured: 
 Heart rate; beats/minute. 
 BP; systolic and diastolic, mmHg. 
 Respiratory rate; breaths/minute. 
 Body temperature; T, °C or °F. 
8.5.4.3 Weight measurement 
Body weight (to the nearest 0.1 ki logram in indoor clothing, bu t without shoes) will be measured 
during the Screening Period and at any study treatment administration visits.  
8.5.4.4 Body Surface Area 
For cetuximab treatment dose, patient’s BSA will be calculated before each administration using the 
most recent patient weight available. If the patient's weight a t the beginning of each cycle varies > 10% 
from the last cycle, the dose must be recalculated. The height will be measured at Visit 1 Cycle 1 and 
serves as basis for the calculation of BSA ensuring the correct  dose adjustment for cetuximab. Any of 
the established formulas may be used to calculate BSA according  ASCO guidelines ( 40). 
8.5.4.5 Performance Status Evaluation 
PS evaluation will be performed a t each study visit from Screen ing to End of Study Visit using the 
ECOG status.

8.5.4.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Safety laboratory assessments wi ll be performed in fasting condition as reported in Sections 2.2  
and 2.3. Beta human chorionic gonadotropi n (β-HCG) pregnancy test will  be performed in serum, if 
applicable, during the Screening Period, at Visit 1 of each cyc le and at the End of Study Visit. 
Urinalysis will be assessed at Screening, at Visit 1 of each cy cle, and at the End of Study Visit. The 
assessment of anti-HIV antibodi es, anti-HBcAg antibodies, anti-HBsAg antibodies, HBV-DNA, 
HCV-RNA will be perfor med ONLY during the Screening Period. Saf ety tests will be performed by 
the local laboratory of participating sites in order to ensure prompt patient management. For the same 
reason, tests for anti-HIV anti bodies, anti-HBcAg antibodies, a nti-HBsAg antibodies, HBV-DNA, 
HCV-RNA will be performed by local laboratory of participating sites according to local standard 
procedures. In case the laboratory tests for anti-HIV antibodie s, anti-HBcAg antibodies, anti-HBsAg 
antibodies, HBV-DNA, and HCV-RNA have been performed within 3 m onths prior to Screening 
Period in the context of the standard patient’s management (eit her in the local lab or in a different 
lab, provided that they comply with local standard procedures),  they can be reported in the eCRF 
under Screening Period procedures and in the patient file as a source document, and these tests will 
not be repeated. 
Laboratory values have to be transcribed into the eCRF, except for urinalysis for which, only the 
judgement has to be reported in the eCRF; the Sponsor will be p rovided with the currently valid 
version of the respective normal ranges by the site laboratories (any update of reference ranges needs to be notified on an ongoing basis). The lab print-outs should be iden tified with the patient number. All print-outs should be dated and 
signed by the Investigator and stored in the patient’s record. Any out of range value shall be clinically 
assessed by the Investigator. The volume of blood to be drawn for each set of safety lab test s will amount to a maximum of 15 mL. 
The following tests w ill be performed ( Table 8-8 ).

8.5.5.1 Primary Endpoints 
Step 1 (Identification of Dose for Cohort Expansion): 
 Identification of the dose for the Cohort Expansion, defined as  the highest dose level 
(maximum dose tested 48 mg BID, minimal dose tested 32 mg BID) at which no more than 
1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT (see DLT definition) during t he DLT assessment window 
(28 days) or the maximum dose j udged to be tolerable by the DSC . 
 The DSC will review and evaluate all the available safety data,  any DLTs and PK data 
collected during Step 1, in orde r to confirm the RP2D to be tested in Step 2 (s ee also Section 
8.7). 
Step 2 (Cohort Expansion Phase): 
 Best ORR defined according to RECIST v1.1 assessment locally pe rformed using CT scan or 
MRI of the chest and abdomen (in cluding pelvis and adrenal glan ds). Any other areas of 
disease involvement should be additionally investigated based o n signs and symptoms of the 
individual patient.

remains stable over a certain ti me period. DCR is the sum of the complete, partial and stable 
disease rates according to local assessment.  
 Duration of response defined as t ime from confirmation of a PR,  CR or SD as locally assessed, 
until the disease has been shown to progress following treatmen t.  
 PFS: Defined as the number of days between the first study trea tment administration to the 
date of first documented disease progression as per local asses sment, relapse or death from 
any cause. Responding patients and patients who are lost to fol low-up are censored at their 
last tumour assessment date. 
 OS: Defined as the number of day s between the first study treat ment administration and death 
from any cause. 
For the baseline assessment, CT  scan or MRI should be performed  no more than 4 weeks before the 
start of study treatment. Follow-up assessment will be performe d every 2 cycles during study 
treatment starting from Day 1 Cy cle 3 (within a window of 7 day s before the visit date) until objective 
disease progression as define d by RECIST v1.1 or at the End of Study Visit. Any other site at which 
a new disease is suspected should be appropriately imaged. If a n unscheduled assessment is 
performed and the disease has not progressed, subsequent assess ments should be performed at their 
scheduled visits.

8.6 Adverse Event Definitions, Monitoring/Recording and Management 
8.6.1 Definitions 
8.6.1.1 Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a medicinal 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationsh ip with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavo urable and unintended sign (in cluding an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease te mporally associated with the us e of a medicinal product, whether or 
not considered related to the medicinal product. 
8.6.1.2 Drug Relationship 
The relationship between an AE a nd study treatments will be judged according to the following 
categories: 
1. Certainly related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) has a plausible  time 
relationship to the drug intake a nd it cannot be explained by a  concurrent disease or other drugs. 
The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be plausible (pharmacologically, 
pathologically). The event must be definitive phar macologically  or phenomenologically (i.e. an 
objective and specific medical disorder or a recognised pharmac ological phenomenon), using a 
satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. 
2. Probably related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) with reasonable time 
relationship to the drug intake, it is unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other drugs

and it follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal ( dechallenge). Rechallenge (AE 
reappearance after drug reintrodu ction) is not required to fulf il this definition.  
3. Possibly related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) has a reasonable time 
relationship to the drug intake, but it could also be explained  by disease or other drugs. 
Information on drug withdrawal (dechallenge) may be lacking or unclear. 
4. Unassessable/Unclassifiable : The relationship cannot be judged, because of the information  is 
insufficient or contradictory an d data cannot be supplemented or verified. 
5. Unlikely related : The event or laboratory test a bnormality (AE), with a time to  drug intake that 
makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible). Disease or other drugs provide plausible 
explanations. 
6. Not Related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE), with a time to  drug intake with an 
unreasonable relationship and o r non-plausibility and/or the ex istence of a clear alternative 
explanation.  
8.6.1.3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
AEs will be categorized as TEAE or Non-TEAE. If an AE occurs fo r the first time or if it worsens in 
terms of seriousness or severity after the first study treatmen t intake, it will be classified as TEAE, 
otherwise it will be classified as non-TEAE. 
8.6.1.4 Adverse Drug Reactions 
Any untoward and unintended res ponses to an investigational med icinal product related to any dose 
administered. The defin ition covers also me dication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the 
protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product. 
The definition implies a reasonab le possibility of a causal rel ationship between the event and MEN1611, 
cetuximab or both given in combination. This means that there a re facts (evidence) or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship. 
ADRs are considered all AEs for which the relationship with any of the IMPs is considered as: 
1. Certainly related 
2. Probably related 
3. Possibly related 
4. Unassessable/Unclassifiable 
AEs are not considered as ADRs when the relationship is judged as:

8.6.1.5 Seriousness 
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death; 
 Is life-threatening; 
 Requires in-patient hospitalisa tion or prolongatio n of existing  hospitalisation; 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 Results in congenital an omaly/birth defect; 
 Is other medically important c ondition that may jeopardise the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above.  
Note-1:  These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at th e time the event occurs. For 
example, regarding a life-threatening event, this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event w hich hypothetically mi ght have caused death 
if it had been more severe.  
Any other AE/ADR which is not in cluded in the above definitions  will be considered as non-serious. 
Note-2: Hospitalisation lasting less tha n 24 hours or pre-planned hospi talisation for medical intervention, 
such as study treatment adminis tration or PK sampling time-poin ts, shall not qualify as SAE/Adverse 
Drug Reaction Intensity (Severity). Each event will be graded for severity using the classifications of NCI CTCAE v5.0. For events not addressed in the NCI CTCAE v5.0 classification, the following g rading will apply:  
 Mild (Grade 1) - Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; interventi on not indicated. 
 Moderate (Grade 2) - Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive i ntervention indicated; 
limiting age-appropriate instrum ental activity of daily living.  
 Severe (Grade 3) - Severe or medically significant but not imme diately life-threatening; 
hospitalisation or prolongation of  hospitalisation indicated; d isabling; limiting self-care 
activity of daily living. 
 Life-threatening (Grade 4) - Lif e-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Death (Grade 5) - Relat ed to adverse event.

8.6.1.6 Adverse Drug Reaction Expectedness 
An ADR is considered unexpected when its nature, intensity, or outcome is not consistent with the 
applicable product information provided in the Reference Safety  Information document (MEN1611 IB, 
version in force and cetuximab SmPC). 
8.6.1.7 Serious Unexpected Adverse Reaction 
Any SAE judged by the Investigator  or the Sponsor as drug-related (see Section 8.6.1.2 ) and considered 
as unexpected is qualified as a Suspected Unexpected Serious Ad verse Reaction (SUSAR). 
SUSARs are subject to expedited reporting, as specified in Sect ion 8.6.3.2 , as having a “Reasonable 
Possibility” of relationship with the study trea tment (MEN1611,  cetuximab or thei r combination). 
8.6.2 Monitoring and Recording of Adverse Events 
At each visit the Investigator will assess any occurred subjective or objective AE, starting from the date 
of screening informed consent si gnature to the End of Study Visit. 
The Investigator should manage a s AE any laboratory test abnorm ality (newly occurring after the 
IMP administration or worsening of previously known abnormaliti es) considered as clinically 
significant as per Investigator’s judgement: i.e. values signif icantly above or under normal range or 
which require an intervention or diagnostic tests, or may resul t in the IMP discontinuation. The 
Investigator shall record on the respective eCRF-AE pages any A E, serious or non-serious, whether 
or not thought to be drug-relate d, observed in or reported by t he patient (or relatives/delegates), 
specifying the judgement on the causal relationship with the st udy treatment. When the investigator 
confirms that all the collected information on any Individual C ase Safety Report (ICSR; serious or 
not, related or not) has been entered in the eCRF, an email not ification is automatically sent to the 
Sponsor. 
AEs communicated by the patient or by the patient’s relatives o r delegates through phone calls, letters

8.6.3 Management of Serious Adverse Events 
8.6.3.1 Reporting Duties of the Investigator 
The Investigator must record and save all the available informa tion on any ICSR with at least one SAE 
(whether or not deemed related to any of the study treatments) by completing the eCRF-AE pages. 
He/she must also ensur e that any con cerned eCRF pages containin g all the available information at that 
time are updated no later than 24 hours after the first knowledge of the occurrence of the case. 
When the site personnel enter a new SAE/case in the eCRF, an au tomatic alert notification will be 
generated and sent to the Sponsor ’s Study Drug Safety Manager ( SDSM).  
The Investigator will be provided with the paper CRF-SAE form to be used only in case of 
breakdown/non availability of the eCRF System. In such case, the Investigator will be responsible for 
sending the paper CRF-SAE form to the SDSM no later than 24 hours  after the first knowledge and 
subsequently inserting the data i n eCRF as soon as the system works again.  
Whenever the paper CRF -SAE form is used, i t must be submitted b y email to the Sponsor’s SDSM:  
Sponsor’s SDSM contact details : 
 
Alfons XII, 587 08918 Badalona (Barcelona), Spain Phone:  
Mobile:  
Email:  
For the initial SAE notificat ion, the Investigator should enter  at least the following data: 
 AE medical term. 
 Seriousness criteria. 
 Causality assessment.  
 Patient ID (when the paper CRF-SAE forms are used). 
 Reporter’s name and telephone number for clarification (when th e paper CRF-SAE forms are 
used). 
If not already reported, the full description of the event and outcome must follow w ithin 1 working day. 
The Sponsor’s confirmation of reception of the SAE report must be kept in the patient’s records at 
the site.  Any questions arising during the processing and medical review of the SAE will be managed by 
means of electronic queries (i.e.  queries in the eCRF). In case  of a breakdown of the eCRF System, 
queries will be sent by email.

Any information provided by the Investigator as a query reply or as a follow-up SAE report will be 
processed in the same way as the initial SAE report within the required timeframe.  
When relevant, the eCRF pages concerning medical history, concomitant medication and laboratory 
tests will also be retriev ed by the Sponsor’s SDSM. 
Any further significant informa tion and supporting documentatio n that becomes available (such as 
copies of laboratory reports, tests, procedures, autopsy eviden ce of the cause of death, etc.) shall be 
provided to the Sponsor’s SDSM, preferably by entering it in th e eCRF or by email (in case of eCRF 
unavailability), no later tha n 24 hours after they become known  by the Investigator. 
The Investigator must also compl y with the local applicable obl igation(s) on the reporting of ADRs 
to the local concerned CA /Ethics Committees (ECs) /IRBs if req uired according to the specific 
country requirements.  
8.6.3.2 Reporting Duties of the Sponsor 
The Sponsor has appointed a centralized Study Drug Safety Unit (SDSU) team, that will be 
responsible for the management of AEs from all the sites in com pliance with the applicable regulatory 
requirements (including SAEs and SUSARs management), as well as for all safety communications 
s u b m i t t e d  t o  t h e  s i t e s ,  C A s  a n d  E C s / I R B s  a c c o r d i n g l y  t o  t h e  p r o cedures described in the 
corresponding study Safety Management Plan (SMP). 
 Particularly, the Sponsor’s SDSU shall ensure that all relevant  information about any SUSAR is 
expeditiously reported to the CAs and ECs/IRBs (following general and local rules and procedures), with the below applicable dead lines after the first knowledge (Day 0), intended as the day when the 
Sponsor’s receives the notifica tion of the SUSAR or the monitor  is aware of it: 
 Fatal and life-threatening une xpected cases, no later than 7 da ys; 
 Other unexpected serious cases, no later than 15 days. 
The Sponsor shall ensure that al l relevant new information and supporting documentation that 
subsequently become available is also expeditiously reported as  follow-up information no later than 
15 days after the first knowledge for all cases. The following safety issues will be subjected to expedited mana gement for the identification of 
possible necessary actions: 
 SAEs associated with the study procedures; 
 Potential clinically significan t findings emerging from non-cli nical studies; 
 An anticipated end or suspension for safety reasons of another study with the same study 
treatment.

When appropriate and applicable as per local regulatory require ments, the Sponsor will circulate the 
relevant new information al so to the Investigators.  The Sponsor (through the SDSU) will distribute 
the validated Council for International Organization of Medical  Sciences (CIOMS) I form  or 
MedWatch form + AOSE (Analysis of Similar Events) (for USA) to the investigators (via e-mail) 
with a safety letter, if req uired by local regulations. 
 
Note-1:  For SUSARs occurred in other ongoing studies with MEN1611, if any, the Sponsor will 
comply with the expedited reporting obligations to the ECs, CAs  and Investigators involved in 
MEN1611-02 study. 
 
Note-2:  The Sponsor will be responsible for expeditiously reporting SUSAR cases attributable to 
cetuximab, following the procedure described in the SMP, and in forming the corresponding 
Marketing Authorization Holder (as per SmPC details) of the cas e and expedited reporting done.            
For SUSARs occurred with non-IMP (e.g. concomitant medication) the post-marketing 
pharmacovigilance rules should be  followed according to the requirements of the country of 
occurrence.  
8.6.4 Management of Non-Serious Advers e Events and/or Laboratory 
Abnormalities 
The Investigator must record all the available information conc erning any non-serious AE (whether 
or not deemed related to MEN1611, to cetuximab or to their comb ination) in the corresponding 
section of the eCRF, eCRF-AE pages, within 5 calendar days  a f t e r  t h e  f i r s t  k n o w l e d g e  o f  t h e  
occurrence of the event. When the site personnel enter a new AE/case in the eCRF, an aut omatic alert notification will be 
generated and sent to the Sponsor’s SDSM.  If relevant, all eCRF pages concer ning medical history, concomi tant medication, laboratory tests and 
any other relevant information will also be retrieved by the Sp onsor’s SDSM and saved in the safety 
master file. Any further significant informa tion and supporting documentatio n that become available (such as 
copies of laboratory tests, procedures, etc.) shall also be pro vided by the Investigator through the 
eCRF or by e-mail in case of eCRF unavailability to the Sponsor ’s SDSM. 
In addition, during the clinical s tudy, abnormalities in labora tory analyses, physical examination, 
urinalysis, vital signs and 12-lead ECG (newly occurring after ICF signature or worsening of previously known abnormalities), which are considered clinicall y relevant by the Principal 
Investigator (such as values significantly above or under norma l range or which require an

intervention or diagnostic tests,  or may result in the disconti nuation of the study treatment), should 
be reported as AEs. All clini cally significant abnormalities in  laboratory values, physical 
examination, urinalysis, vital signs and 12-lead ECG will be co llected and reviewed by the Sponsor 
on a bi-monthly basis.  
8.6.5 Management of Pregnancy Exposure Cases 
The Investigator is expected to record in a dedicated “Pregnanc y Exposure Report Form” any case of 
pregnancy exposure occurring in a  female patient or in the fema le partner of a patient enrolled on the 
study and while participating in  the study (occurring during th e treatment and follow-up periods). 
The “Pregnancy Exposure Report Form” is distribut ed to the site s to be used for this purpose. 
In case of pregnancy, the patient will be withdrawn from the st udy treatment. The Investigator is 
requested to follow each case of pregnancy until the outcome, p rovided that the female patient or the 
female partner of a male patie nt enrolled in the study has signed the related pregnancy ICF. 
The form will be sent to the S ponsor’s SDSM by email within 5 d ays after the Investigator becomes 
aware of the pregnancy and it is to be fully completed and sent  again within 5 days after the outcome 
is known, if it is normal (healthy newborn). If the pregnancy r esults in an abnormal outcome, this will 
be recorded in the eCRF as an SAE and managed as described in Section 8.6.3.1. In case the eCRF is 
no more available, it will be ma naged through the paper CRF-SAE  form and sent to the Sponsor by 
email. 
8.6.6 Management of Misuse and Overdose Cases 
Although study drug misuse and overdose are not considered AEs per se, both issues should be 
reported to the Sponsor’s SDSU, even if they may not result in an adverse outcome. In the event of 
overdose, the patient should be observed closely for signs of t oxicity. Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provide d if clinically indicated. 
For the purpose of this protocol, an overdose is any dose of th e investigational drugs (MEN1611 or 
cetuximab) which is more than th e assigned dose level for that patient. The corresponding information 
should be entered in the AE page in the eCRF no later than 24 h ours since awareness by the site. Once 
the page is completed and saved by the staff involved in the st udy, an alert notification will be 
automatically sent to the Sponsor.  ONLY if the eCRF system does not work or if the eCRF is not 
available, the paper SAE report form shall be used and sent to the Sponsor by email. 
In addition, if an AE (serious or non-serious) is associated with an overdose, it will be recorded in the AE page in the e-CRF, recordi ng the overdose details. 
If the pharmacy service detects or suspects that an overdose has or may have been administered, they should immediately contact the I nvestigator and the Sponsor (or  their delegate) and let them know.

8.6.7 Periodic Safety Reporting 
8.6.7.1 Annual Safety Reporting (DSUR or IND Annual Report) 
Once a year throughout th e clinical study, the Development Safe ty Update Report (DSUR) will be 
submitted by the Sponsor to the concerned CAs (including Food a nd Drug Administration [FDA]) 
and ECs, taking into account all ne w safety information received during the reporting period. 
In Europe, the DSUR will be submitted to CAs and ECs by the SDSU within 60 calendar days after 
the Data Lock Point (DLP). In US, the DSUR will be submitted to the US Agent within 50 calendar days after the DLP, who will subsequently submit it to the FDA within 60 calendar days after the 
Data Lock Point (DLP) 
8.6.7.2 Periodic Line-listing s Safety Reporting 
All SUSARs occurred in the MEN1611-02 study and/or in any other  ongoing trial using MEN1611 
and conducted by Menarini, either in the European Community or in a third country, will be recorded 
in a line - listing prepared by t he SDSU (every 6 months).  
The final line-listing will be sent to the Investigators and EC , as required per country regulations. All 
Investigators are required to acknowledge their correct recepti on and reading of this information to 
the Sponsor by e-mail.  Note:  In case that no SUSARs occur, the line-listing will not be necessary. 
8.6.8 Safety Issues other than SUSARs 
During the present clinical trial, it may occur that events whi ch do not fall within the definition of 
SUSAR and, thus, are not subject to the reporting requirements for SUSARs, are considered relevant in terms of patient safety. In ge neral, it could be the case of new events related t o the conduct of this 
or other trials with MEN1611 to b e likely to affect the safety of patients (e.g.: an SAE which could 
be associated with the trial pro cedures and which could modify the conduct of the trial, major safety 
findings from newly completed an imal studies, such as carcinoge nicity, or non-serious AEs of special 
interest as per DSC indication). In such cases, appropriate act ions are to be immediately taken (e.g. 
urgent measures and their notific ation to the authorities, a su bstantial amendment to the protocol or 
the early termination of the tri al if necessary). In any case t he Sponsor shall inform the National 
Competent Authority as well as th e concerned ECs and participating investigators of any safety issues 
which might materially alter the current benefit-risk assessmen t of the study IMP.

8.6.9 Breaking of the Randomisation Code 
Breaking of the Randomisation Code  procedure is not applicable to this study. 
8.6.10  Serious and Non-Serious Ad verse Events Follow-up 
After the End of Study Visit, the Investigator is not requested  to actively follow-up the patient unless 
ongoing SAEs or non-serious AEs of special interest (as per the  DSC) are present. However, if after 
the end of the study, the Investigator becomes aware of any SAE s with a suspected causal relationship 
to the study treatment, they should be duly reported to the Sponsor. These SAEs should be recorded 
in the eCRF if it is available. If the eCRF is not available, t he paper CRF-SAE form will be used as 
a backup.  Patients who discontinued the tr eatment for safety reasons will  be followed-up until the event 
disappears, the patient’s condition stabilises, or until recovery from all toxic effects and longer in case of expected delayed toxicity. 
8.7 Data Safety Committee and Safety Monitoring 
In conjunction with the investig ators, the Sponsor will constan tly monitor the incoming safety data, 
especially TEAEs, SAEs and SUSARs to continuously assess the ov erall risk/benefit of the patients 
enrolled in this study and t o take appropriate actions. 
A DSC will be established consisting of the Principal Investiga tor(s) and the Sponsor’s qualified 
medical representative(s), as well as invited experts (such as statistician and pharmacokineticist), as 
appropriate. The DSC is responsible for reviewing and evaluatin g all the available safety data, any 
DLTs and PK data collected during  Step 1 in order to confirm th e RP2D to be tested in Step 2. During 
Step 2 of the study, safety and need for dose reductions and/or  modifications will continue to be 
monitored for all patients in all cycles and the DSC will revie w this study in regular meetings (at least 
every 3 months).  
The DSC may also meet in ad hoc  meetings at its discretion, as needed in response to events occurring 
in the study. Data will be provi ded by the Sponsor to the DSC as described in the approved Data 
Review Plan. The Data Review Plan will be finalized under respo nsibility of the Sponsor before the 
First Patient In.

10.1 Data Collection 
Data collection activities will be carried out under the respon sibility of the Sponsor. Patient data will 
be collected using an Electronic Data Capture system (EDC; see Section 10.1.1). Patients will be 
identified by the st udy identificati on number (Patient ID), ass igned during the Pre-Screening Period.  
The Patient ID will be a numbe r composed of 8 digits CCCSSPPP:  
 CCC is the international phone code of the country (with a leading zero for countries that have a 2-digit phone code). 
 SS is the site number in the country: it will start from 01 for  each country and will be 
ascending. 
 PPP is the patient number in the site; it will start from 001 a nd will be ascending. 
Data will be collected, processe d, evaluated, reviewed and stor ed in anonymous form in accordance 
with applicable data protection regulations. 
10.1.1  Electronic Case Report Form 
Clinical data collected during the study at sites will be recor ded in an eCRF using iMedidata RAVE 
which is a validated system. The Sponsor will be responsible to  develop the eCRF based on this study 
protocol and to review and perfo rm the user acceptance test of the eCRF in order to ensure protocol 
adherence. The eCRF will be made available to the study personnel by means of the iMedidata interface which is a validated system. The accounts will be individual and pass word-protected. 
The Investigator or designee will be responsible for entering s tudy data into the eCRF in accordance 
to the eCRF completion guidelines provided by the Sponsor. In o rder to improve the quality of data 
collection and cleaning, data shal l be entered into the eCRF as  closely as possible to the time when 
they become available and not later than within 5 working days.  The eCRF data will not be considered 
as source data (the definiti on of the source data can be found in 
Section 10.3). 
Investigators will ensure the ac curacy, completeness and consis tency of data entered signing 
electronically the eCRF usi ng the personal password. 
An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to  the data.

Patients are required to record  their use of MEN1611 daily inta ke (including the time of each intake) 
for the whole study duration in  a paper booklet (patient diary)  that will be provided by the Sponsor. 
The patient has to bring the diary to the site at each study vi sit and the completed diary pages have to 
be checked by the Investigator. At each cycle (Visit 1), the co mpleted diary will be collected and data 
entered into the eCRF. The Investigator or designee will be res ponsible for entering diary data into 
the eCRF. At the same time, a new diary will be dispensed to th e patient for completion. 
10.1.4  Central Laboratory/Examination Data 
Central laboratories’ data will be managed according to laborat ory SOPs and will be transferred to 
Menarini Ricerche S.p.A., Clinic al Sciences department for stat istics and PK analyses. Sites will 
receive from central laboratories only reports related to PIK3CA, N-K-RAS and BRAF  mutational 
analysis of ctDNA. Details on the collection, handli ng and shipment of samples wil l be provided in a separate Laboratory 
Manual prior to the start of the study.

at any data capture sys tem version change.  
10.2 Clinical Data Management 
Data Management will be carrie d out under the re sponsibility of  the Sponsor. 
The eCRF data will be electronically verified through the use o f on-line and off-line checks. 
Discrepancies in the data will  be resolved by means of electron ic queries. Data will be locked by the 
data manager when all activities  for the study, including medic al revision of the data, are complete 
and no more entries are expected.  
Data from sources other than the eCRF will  be provided to the d ata manager on an agreed scheduled 
basis. The data manager has the responsibility to reconcile dat a captured in the eCRF, with external 
data sources. Discrepancies found  in the reconciliation of the data, will be addressed by means of 
queries. A clear overview of all clinical data management activities wil l be given in the data management 
plan. 
10.3 Source Data 
Source data are defined as all data in original records and cer tified copies of original records of 
clinical findings, observations or other activities in a clinic al study that are necessary for the 
reconstruction and evalu ation of the study. 
Original documents and data records include, but are not limite d to hospital/patients’ medical records, 
laboratory notes, radiological images, ECG records, patient’s d iary, patients’ identification forms and

precautions within the constraints of the applicable regulatory  requirements to maintain the 
confidentiality of patient ident ities and sponsor proprietary i nformation.  
Data should be consistent with the source documents and discrep ancies, if any, should be explained 
in writing. All the original documentation pertinent to the stu dy procedures must be available for 
review in each patient’s record. 
 
10.4 Quality Control/Quality Assurance 
10.4.1  Study Monitoring 
This study will be monitored in accordance with the ICH Guideli nes for GCP. Monitoring will be 
carried out under the responsibility of the CRO (IQVIATM). The site monitor will perform visits to 
the study sites during the study  conduct. Facilities, study tre atment, storage area, storage conditions 
for biological samples, eCRF, pa tient’s source data and all other study documentation will be 
inspected/reviewed by the site m onitor for adher ence to the pro tocol and GCP. At each site visit, the 
monitor will review the eCRFs for completion and accuracy. Accu racy will be checked by performing 
source data verification that is a direct comparison of the ent ries made onto the eCRFs against the 
appropriate source documentation. Any resulting discrepancies w ill be reviewed with the Investigator 
and his/her staff. The Investigator agrees to allow access to a ll study-related materials needed for the 
proper review of study conduct and to assist the monitor during  the monitoring visits and during the 
data cleaning process. Monitoring procedures require that 100% of data are source data verified 
starting from the date of the Sc reening informed consent signat ure to the End of Study, particularly 
focusing on informed consents, a dherence to inclusion/exclusion  criteria, drug accountability, 
documentation of SAEs and the proper recording of efficacy and safety measurements. All 
monitoring activities will be described in detail in the study-specific monitoring plan. 
10.4.2  Quality Assurance 
Independent study audit(s) and/or inspection(s) may take place at any time during or after the study. 
The independent audit/inspection can be carried by the Quality Assurance (QA) of the CRO, an independent QA Department, or a CA. At all times, the confident iality of patient-related documents 
will be maintained.

11 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE WHOLE STUDY 
The whole study may be discontinued at the discretion of the Sp onsor in the event of any of the 
following: 
 New information leading to unfavourable risk-benefit judgement of the study treatment due 
to: 
o Occurrence of clinically significant unknown AEs or unexpectedl y high intensity or 
incidence of known AEs. 
o New evidence of unfavourable safety or efficacy findings (from clinical or non-clinical 
examinations, e.g. toxicology). 
 The Sponsor’s decision that continuation of the study is unjust ifiable for medical or ethical 
reasons. 
 Discontinuation of developmen t of the study treatment. 
CAs and IRB/IECs will be inform ed about the discontinuation of the study in accordance with 
applicable regulations.

12 END OF CLINICAL STUDY AND ARCHIVING 
The clinical study will end wit h the collection and analysis of  study data and the iss ue of the clinical 
study report. All essential documents will be archived by the Sponsor according to the relevant SOP. 
12.1 Archiving of Electroni c Documentation/Data 
Duplicate electronic media such as CDs/DVDs (1 for routine acce ss and 1 for back-up) containing 
the patient data in PDF format (i.e. eCRFs) for each site will be prepared by the Sponsor or a delegate 
for archiving purposes. The electr onic media, of not re-printab le type, will be appropriately labelled 
recording the files/data include d. The files should contain at least the e-data copy clearly reporting 
the system name, study code and the eCRF version used; for eCRF data also the electronic signature 
and the associated audit trails have to be included. The Invest igator should verify whether the 
provided electronic media repres ent a complete copy of eCRFs ge nerated during the study. The 
Investigator has to confirm the receipt and correctness of the material by signing a dedicated form 
provided by the Sponsor , the signed form has to be collected an d archived in the TMF. Investigators 
will be also responsible for elect ronic media refreshment appro ximately every 7 years to ensure long 
term archiving of files/data. Two  copies of the same electronic media prepared for the sites or 
cumulative electronic media with  the same content will be archi ved by the Sponsor and refreshed 
approximately every 7 years to ensure long term archiving of fi les/data. In addition the Sponsor is 
responsible to create 2 electroni c media (1 for routine access and 1 for back-up) containing an 
integrated Statistical Analysis System (SAS) database with all study data (e.g. eCRF, IWRS, central 
laboratory), with appropriat e refreshment procedures.

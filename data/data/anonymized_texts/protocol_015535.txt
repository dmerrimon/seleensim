I ntroduction 
W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., has developed an atrial septal defect (ASD) 
closure device, the GORE® Septal Occluder. This minimally invasive occluder 
device is intended to effectively repair ostium secundum ASDs.  
Ostium secundum atrial septal defects present as a persistent communication between the atria and are a common congenital cardiac anomaly accounting for approximately 10% of all congenital heart disease. They are one of the most common cong enital heart defects to present in 
adulthood. Untreated, ASDs produce right heart volume overload and 
progressive impairment over time, including reduced aerobic capacity, atrial 
dysrhythmias, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and potential paradoxical embolism. In th e U.S. alone it is estimated that 
approximately 10,000 new patients per year can be expected to have an ASD. Successful surgical repair of ASD has been performed for 50 years with 
continued improvement in technique and outcomes. King and Mills reported the first transcatheter closure of ASD in 1976, but the delivery system was 
quite large and impractical, especially for younger patients. With time, improvements in design concepts and materials discoveries have led to 
improved results in transcatheter closure systems. Several devices are now 
available commercially for transcatheter ASD closure. 
The primary objective of the GORE
® Septal Occluder Study is to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of the occluder devi ce in the treatment of transcatheter 
closure of ostium secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs). The data obtained in 
this study will evaluate this next gener ation device as compared to outcomes 
of prior studies conducted with the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder. 
Device Description 
GORE® Septal Occluder 
The GORE® Septal Occluder consists of an implantable occluder and a 
catheter delivery system. The occluder is comprised of five platinum-filled 
nickel-titanium (Nitinol) wires which form a frame covered with expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The eP TFE is treated with a hydrophilic 
coating to facilitate echocardiographic imaging of the occluder and surrounding tissue during implantation.  When fully deployed, the occluder 
assumes a configuration (see Figure 1) to prevent shunting of blood between 
the right and left atria.  
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 8 
Doc Type: GC 
The occluder is configured in nominal diameters of 15, 20, 25, and 30mm.  
The occluder is delivered using conventional catheter delivery techniques and may be delivered with the aid of a 0.035" guidewire, or smaller, if necessary.   
Fi
gure 1: GORE® Septal Occluder 
GORE® Septal Occluder Delivery System 
The delivery system consists of a 75 cm working length 10 Fr (O.D.) delivery catheter, a control catheter, and a mandrel coupled to a handle (Figure 2). The handle facilitates loading, deployment, and locking of the occluder. The 
handle also allows repositioning and retrieval of the occluder via the retrieval 
cord, if necessary.  
The catheter delivery system for the GORE
® Septal Occluder is a catheter and 
handle assembly composed of four primary components.  
• Delivery Catheter: Delivers the occluder to the treatment site.
• Control Catheter: Advances/retracts the occluder at the treatment
site.
•
Mandrel: Supports the Nitinol fr ame and the locking mechanism of
the occluder.
•
Handle: Facilitates simple push/pull motions for occl uder loading,
deployment, and locking.
The catheter components are arranged coaxially and are coupled to the 
handle mec
hanism. The handle moves the catheter components separately or 
in combination to facilitate simple pu sh/pull motions for occluder loading, 
deployment, and locking.  The retrieval cord attaches the proximal eyelet of 
the occluder to the control catheter and facilitates occluder retrieval after lock

release, if necessary.  A flexible flushing port is attached to the handle to 
permit convenient device flushing prior to implant.

In all cases, the Investigator maintains exclusive responsibility for the 
inclusion and exclusion of any potential study participant(s). All patients presenting for treatment of ASD are evaluated for study participation based 
on the inclusion/exclusion criteria provided in this protocol. 
Screening /Pre-treatment Evaluation  
When t
he Investigator identifies a patient as a potential candidate for 
inclusion in the study, the necessary medical history, physical exam and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are reviewed. If the patient meets the criteria 
for entry into the study, the Patient Informed Consent Form  is 
administered. 
A screening evaluation is performed within six (6) months of procedure 
to identify initial suitability of defect closure. This pre-treatment patient 
evaluation will assess eligibility variables by means of physical 
examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic 
echocardiography (TTE),  transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or other appropriate imaging to estimate static defect size of 17 mm or less may be enrolled. Peri-procedural antibiotics may be prescribed at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Subjects with additional cardiac conditions anticipated to require 
surgery within three (3) years of enrollment are not permitted in the study. In addition, no concurrent intervention(s) should be performed during the occluder procedure. 
Screen Failure 
Patients who consent to participate in the st
udy, but who are 
determined to not have suitable anatomy and no GORE® Septal Occluder 
implant or placement is attempted, will be considered screen failures and will not be followed in this study (see Study Schema, Section 5.1). No post-procedure study follow-up or  contact will be required for these

patients. Screen failures will be recorded on the appropriate case report 
form (CRF) in the EDC system. 
E nrollment 
A subject is considered enrolled in to the clinical study when the GORE® 
Septal Occluder device is introduced into the anatomy of the subject.  Subjects who enroll in the trial and have a successful implant should be followed through 36 months post index procedure (see Study Schema, Section 5.1).  
Transcatheter Procedure 
Subjects will be consented to the GORE® Septal Occluder Study prior to 
transcatheter procedure. 
Subjects will undergo placement of the GORE® Septal Occluder via a 
transcatheter procedure. During the transcatheter procedure either 
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or intracardiac 
echocardiography (ICE) will be perf ormed with general anesthesia or 
conscious sedation based on the institution or Investigator’s general practice. These are acceptable testing modalities during the transcatheter procedure. Procedure time begins upon venous 
cannulation and procedure time ends upon removal of the final catheter. 
At that time, under general anesthesia or conscious sedation and by 
utilizing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), either TEE or  ICE static sizing and stop flow 
balloon sizing of the defect takes place. Static and stop flow balloon 
defect sizing of 17 mm or less and cardiac anatomy will determine final 
patient suitability and the appropriate device size for closure of the defect. 
Data will be recorded to characterize the procedure. 
5.4.4.1 Recommended Procedure Technique (Instructions for Use) 
Detailed Instructions for Use for placement of the GORE® Septal 
Occluder may be found in the GORE® Septal Occluder package as well 
as in Study Regulatory Binder. The following recommendations should be considered when choosing 
the appropriate GORE
® Septal Occluder for the subject: 
1.The selected occluder nominal diameter should be in a ra nge
reflecting 1.75 times the stop flow diameter of the defect (
1.75:1
ratio of devi
ce nominal diameter-to- defect diameter).
2.The defect should be ev aluated to ensure there are adequate
septal rims to retain the device.
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 18  
Doc Type: GC 
3.The occluder size and position shou ld be evaluated to ensure no
interference with other intracardiac or intravavu
lar structures, such
as cardiac valves or pul
monary veins.
4.If successful deployment cannot be achieved after three (3)
attempts, an alternative treatment for ASD clos ure is
recommend
ed. Consideration should be given to  the patient’s total
exposure to radiation if prolonged or multiple attempts are
required for placement of the occluder.
5.Removal of the occluder sh ould be considered if:
Lock loop does not capture all three eyelets;
Occluder will not come to rest in a planar posit
ion apposing
the septal tissue;
Occluder allows excessive shunting ; or
Impingement on adjacent cardiac structures is observed.
Expansion of an occlu
der disc may occur in the periprocedural time 
period. If there is uncertainty that an expanded device remains locked, fluoroscopic examination without cont rast is recommended in order to 
identify if the Lock Loop captures all three eyelets.  
5.4.4.2  Access Site Management 
Closure of the femoral venous puncture site should be performed per hospital standards. Access site hemostasis may be achieved by manual compression, or by utilizing alternative methods, such as a suture closure device. 
Pre- Discharge  
Prior to institutional discharge, pre-discharge evaluations will be performed following the schedule of events (section 5.2). Imaging required is either transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiography 
(TEE/TTE) or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). 
Unsu ccessful GORE® Septal Occluder Procedure 
Subjects with unsuccessful placement of a GORE® Septal Occluder (no 
study device implanted at conclusion of index procedure) will be followed through 30 days post index procedure.  Subjects will be contacted by phone at 30 days for follow-up; upon completion of the telephone follow-up Case Report Form  (CRF) at the 30-day Unsuccessful 
Implant interval, subject is discontinued from the study. These subjects will be considered enrolled and a technical failure for purposes of study analysis. 
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 19  
Doc Type: GC 
Post-Procedure Care 
At the discretion of the Investigator, subjects w
ill be encouraged to limit 
their physical activities for at least two weeks after occluder placement. 
In uncomplicated cases with satisf actory closure, subjects may be 
discharged from the hospital as soon as deemed appropriate by the 
study Investigator. 
Patients are required to be treated with antiplatelet therapy, such as 
aspirin and/or clopidogrel bisulfate, for 6 months post index procedure 
per the institutional standard of care or physician’s general practice. The 
decision to continue antiplatelet therapy beyond 6 months is at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Post-Procedure Eval uations and Testing 
Post-proced
ure evaluations will be pe rformed according to the schedule 
of events. Follow-up information will be recorded in the Clinical Data Management System (CDMS) through the 36 month interval or at the time of subject withdrawal or discontinuation from the study. 
At post-procedure follow-up intervals (30 days, 6, 12, and 36 months) a 
TTE or TEE is required for all subjects with the GORE
® Septal Occluder to 
evaluate defect closure status.  
Fluoroscopic examination without contrast (En face and lateral views) 
will be performed at the 6 and 36 month intervals in order to identify and assess wire frame fractures. Plea se refer to the requirements below 
to determine if fluoroscopic evaluation  is required for subject, or only 
necessary if clinically indicated. 
Lack of device stability may be indicative of wire frame fractures. All 
device fractures are reported on the Subject Follow-up Evaluation CRF.  Additionally, device fractures that result in device removal because of device instability or other clinical sequelae will be reported as adverse 
events. Chest x-ray is not suitable imaging to evaluate the occluder and 
defect closure. 
Fluoroscopy Requirements  
Subject IDs referenced with 
100 and 200 numbers within the
study database must co
mplete 6 and 36 month fluoroscopic
imaging. These are the first 150 subjects enrolled (50 Pivotal
and 100 Continued Acc
ess).
Subject IDs with 300 numbers, fluo roscopic images are
optional an
d only recommended  in subjects where device
stability is questionable at an y follow up interval. Subjects
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 20  
Doc Type: GC 
enrolled with 300 numbers begin with the 151st enrollment 
through the time of PMA approval. 
Institutional subject records or documents from a referring institution or 
physician (i.e., catheterization report, discharge summary, or 
echocardiographic transcription) should not be forwarded to the Sponsor. Necessary records should be available for scheduled monitoring by the Contract Research Organization (CRO) on the Sponsor’s behalf. Documentation for adverse events may be requested. 
All echocardiography and fluoroscopy images obtained at procedural 
and study follow up intervals must be recorded in DICOM format according to echocardiographic guidelines provided with this protocol and uploaded to the BioClinica WebSend secure web portal. Baseline and implant images will be reviewed by the Echo Core Lab to assist in 
evaluating closure progress at  subsequent intervals.  
At the 24 month interval subjects should be contacted and a telephone 
questionnaire CRF completed. 
All planned and unplanned visits, regardless of etiology, will be 
documented in the CDMS system, in cluding reporting of any adverse 
events. It is important that the Invest igator encourage subjects to return 
for all required follow-up visits.  The clinical study objectives will not be 
realized if a significant number of subjects are lost to follow-up or discontinued from further study participation.   
Reinterventi ons 
Reinterventions to the study device (GORE® Septal Occluder) will be 
reported on the Intervention CRF.  If the GORE® Septal Occluder is 
removed as part of the reinterventio n, then the subject is discontinued 
from the study.  If the GORE® Septal Occluder remains implanted, then 
the subject will continue to be enrolled and will complete study follow-
up as prescribed. 
Follo w-up Visit Windows 
The follow-up visits should be completed within an acceptable time 
frame and in accordance with the pr otocol defined visit windows.  The 
follow-up intervals are calculated as calendar days from index 
procedure.  The visit windows are calculated as +/- the number of 
calendar days.

If the visit is not able to be comp leted during these wind
ows the visit 
should be completed as soon as possible; however, it will be considered 
a protocol deviation and should be reported per local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) policy. Visits performed outside the prescribed window will be reported as an Unscheduled visit. 
S ubject Withdrawal from the Clinical Study 
A subject may withdraw from the clinical  study at any time and for any reason, 
and should notify the Investigator in th is event.  Subjects are not obligated to 
reveal their reasons for withdrawal. Th e subject will be withdrawn if he/she 
relocates to another geographic area that  requires a change of physician and 
such suitable physician cannot be identified. 
The Investigator may withdraw the subjec t from the clinical study at any time 
based on his/her medical judgment.  It is important that the Investigator 
encourage subjects to return for all required follow-up visits within the 
designated window.  The clinical study objectives may not be realized if a 
significant number of subjects are lost to follow-up.  A subject may withdraw, or be withdrawn by the Investigator, if he or she is unable to continue 
participation in the study due to any condition unrelated to the study.  
The Investigator or designee must complete the appropriate CRF (Study 
Completion/Discontinuation Form) docu menting the subject’s withdrawal or 
discontinuation from the clinical study.  The subject will be considered withdrawn once the Sponsor receives the respective CRF.     
At any time other than the immediate index procedure during the study where 
complications prevent retention of the GORE
® Septal Occluder (i.e., 
embolization or other event requiring device removal), the subject will be discontinued from further study follow-up.  All adverse events will be collected and reported in compliance wi th this protocol through the point of 
device removal. The Investigator or  designee will complete the Study 
Completion/Discontinuation Form documenting the subject’s discontinuation from the clinical study.  
S ubject Lost to Follow-Up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up and terminated from the study 
once they have missed at least one follow- up visit or at the discretion of the 
Investigator or Sponsor, and three documented attempts have been made by 
the Investigator or designee to contact the subject or legally authorized representative.  One of the three documented attempts must include a certified letter.

S ubject Study Completion 
A subject has completed the study when the 36 month follow-up visit has 
been completed. Any subject who does not complete the 36 month follow-up 
visit due to voluntary withdrawal, phys ician withdrawal, death or any other 
reason will be considered a withdrawal. Subjects will not be provided with any medical care by the Sponsor after study completion or withdrawal. 
E xplant Procedures 
The GORE® Septal Occluder may be explanted during a surgical procedure or 
as part of an autopsy. Investigative Centers are requested to return explanted device to W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. for gross and histological evaluation. Prior to planned or potential device retrieval, contact the GORE
® Septal 
Occluder Study Manager to communicate that a specimen is being retrieved from a study subject. A specimen shipping kit will be sent immediately to the 
Investigative Center. The specimen ki t provides specific packaging and 
handling instructions for the specimen and contains a shipping container. 
C linical Study Administration 
Training 
Participating Investigators are required to complete device didactic and protocol training prior to first implant. The first study impla
nt is observed by a 
Gore representative and is considered a clinical training case.

possible allergic reaction to nickel in wires
perforation of cardiac tissue by th e device
enlargement of the defect during or after device deployment
embolization of the imp lant
surgical intervention to correct device failure
insufficient closure of the defect
 Minimization of Risks 
Potential risks associated with the use of the GORE® Septal Occluder  will be 
minimized by the following: 
W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. has performed qualification
testing on t
he device an d device components and appropriate
quality control measures have been implement ed into
production.
Investigators will be selected who are knowledgeable and
experienced in transcatheter clos ure of ostium secundum atrial
septal defects.
Comprehensive site Investigator and staff traini ng will be
conducted to share information regarding the design of the
occluder, its application, and preliminary clinical results from
any pre-clinical and clinical studies
.
The site Inve stigator, Co- and/or Sub-Investigators, clinical
study coordinator(s) or designee at  each participating site will
be trained to the protoc
ol, reminded of the imp ortance of
patient selection and specific anatomy criteria when using  the
occluder, and subj
ect follow-up requirements.
Protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria and follow-up schedu le
were designed to select appropriate subjects a
nd identify
potential complications early.
Subjects will be assessed post-p rocedure and subsequent ly on
a regular basis to collect information on the subject’s stat us
and any reportable adverse events.
Data completed by the clinical sites will be mo nitored. An
initiation sit
e visit and interim site visit(s) will be conducted as
appropriate  to evaluate protocol compliance and to evaluate
the data for accuracy and subject safety.
Safety and efficacy data obtained during the clinical stud y will
be shared with the site Invest igators to aid understanding of
the device and potential complications associated with it
s use.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 29  
Doc Type: GC 
An evaluation will be completed by the Investigator for each
subject against the inclusion/exclusion criteria before study
entry to ensure the subj ect’s defect and anatomy is
appropriate
. Procedural  echocardiographic or other appropriate
imaging will be use
d to assess the subject defe ct suitability.
Antiplatelet therapy will be prescribed for 6 months post indexprocedure to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Peri-procedural
antibiotics prophylaxis is recomm ended to reduce the risk of
infection.
All protocol defined echocardi ographic images will be reviewed
by the Echo
cardiography  Core Laboratory to evaluate the heart
and any residual shunting across the ASD.
Risk of device embolization has been minimized in two wa ys.
First, the device is designed with a
 retrieval fu nction. The ability
to retrieve the device is maintained until the Investigator
ensures pro
per fit into the defect.  Additionally, the occluder
size selected for the defect is recommended to be
approximately 1.75:1 (device nominal diamet er-to-defect
diameter) a
nd defects not greater than 17mm will be treated in
this protocol. An occlud er that pulls through the defect after left
or right atrial disc conformation may be too small and should
be removed and replac ed with a larger size.
S ummary of Expected Benefits  
The expected benefit to the pa tient from the use of the GORE® Septal 
Occluder in the treatment of ostium secundum  atrial septal defects is to 
reduce or arrest the shunting between the atria, to arrest or reverse the 
associated right heart and pulmonary pathology, and to have a short hospital stay and return to normal activity within two weeks of the procedure.  
Adver se Events and Safety Monitoring 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject whether device related or not.   
An ticipated Adverse Events 
A list of benefits and risks associated with the procedure- and device-related 
complications that may be anticipated in subjects undergoing transcatheter 
ostium secundum ASD closure are identified in Section 8.0, Risk Assessment.  
These pre-defined complications are considered anticipated AEs. If a complication occurs that is not on the list of known, potential complications and the Investigator believes that the complication is a potential UADE (see 
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 30  
Doc Type: GC 
section below), the site should immediately contact the Sponsor to determine 
reporting requirements. 
The Investigator at each investigative site is ultimately responsible for 
reporting AEs to the Sponsor.  The Investigator or designee is required to 
complete the appropriate CRFs to report the occurrence of AEs.  
Un anticipated Advers e Device Effects  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device , if that effect, problem or death was 
not previously identified in nature, se verity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects” (21 CFR Part 
812.3). 
“An Investigator shall submit to the sp onsor and to the reviewing IRB a report 
of any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an investigation 
as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 working days after the Investigator first learns of the effect” (21 CFR Part 812.150).  All UADEs must 
be documented by the Investigator including the date of onset, a complete 
description of the event, possible reason (s) for the event, severity, duration, 
actions taken and outcome.  Copies of all supporting documents will be uploaded into the CDMS concurrently with the appropriate CRF.  A report from the Sponsor will be submitted to the FDA and to all reviewing IRBs and 
participating Investigators within 10 working days after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect. 
Adver se Event Relationship 
Each reported AE will be assessed by  the Investigator for its suspected 
relationship to the occluder device, interventional procedure, and/or study 
medications.  Each relationship will be  defined as either: definitely related, 
probably related, possibly related, unrelated, or unknown.  
Ser ious Adverse Events 
Each AE will be assessed by the Investigator for seriousness. Each AE is 
categorized as either Serious or Non- Serious. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
is an adverse event that: 
1. led to a death;2. led to a serious deterioration in health of a subject that:
results in a life threatening illness or injury;
results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body
function;
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 31  
Doc Type: GC 
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongatio n of existing
hospitalization;
results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent
impairment to body structure or a body function; or
3. led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality/birth defect.
Adverse Event Severity 
Each AE will be assesse
d by the Investigator for severity.  The severity 
describes the maximum intensity of the adverse event; for purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows: 
Mild  Does not interfere with subject’s usual function  
Moderate  Interferes to some extent with subject’s usual function
 
Severe  Interferes significantly wi th subject’s usual function 
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. A severe event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a 
headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject’s usual 
function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for seriousness, as described in section 9.4. 
Adver se Event Data Collection 
All study AEs will be collected, recorded on the appropriate CRF, maintained in the CDMS, and documented in the subject’s permanent medical record. 
Adverse event reporting requirements are as follows: 
Adverse Event Name
Adverse Event Onset Da te
Severity (see Section 9.5)
Primary Relationship (see Section 9.3)
Seriousness (see Section 9.4)
Treatment
Action Take n
Outcome
Adverse Event Resolution Date
If applicable , was AE cause of death.
Adver
se Event Submission Guidelines: 
Adverse event reporting begins once the patient is enrolled in
the trial.  All adverse events should  be reported from
enrollment through study completion/discontinuation.
An adverse event that changes from non-serious to serious
should be r
eported as a new adverse event.
Adverse events with an outcome st atus of “Ongoing” should be
assessed at
 each follow-up evalua tion to determine if the event
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 32  
Doc Type: GC 
has resolved.  Adverse events ongoing at study 
completion/discontinuation should be left as “Ongoing” on the AE case report form.  
Provide a diagnosis if possible. If unable to provide diagnosis,report the symptoms as separate events. Adverse Events
should be reported without abbrev iations or narratives.
If a subject dies while on  study, the cause of death will be
reported as the adverse event and “death” repo rted as the
event outcome on the A
E case repo rt form.   If th e subject has
other ongoing adverse events at the time of death, the outcome
status of those events should be r
eported as “death” on each
AE case report form.
Adver se Event Coding 
Adverse Events will be categorized using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding guidelines. 
Independent Data Revi ew  
The Sponsor will establish an Independent Data Reviewer (IDR). The IDR will provide external oversight and review fo r potential safety concerns. The IDR is 
a physician expert in interventional cardiac therapy who is not participating in the trial and has no other affiliation with W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. 
During the course of the study, the IDR will review aggregate accumulating safety data to monitor for the incid ence of serious adverse events and other 
trends that would warrant modificati on or termination of the study. 
The IDR will review the overall safety data at regular intervals. The IDR 
responsibilities and operating procedures  will be outlined in the IDR charter. 
Any IDR recommendations for study modification or termination because of concerns over subject safety or issues relating to data monitoring or quality control will be submitted in writing to the Sponsor for consideration. 
However, if the IDR at any time determines that a potential serious risk exists to subjects in the study, the IDR will immediately notify the Sponsor. 
S tatistical Analysis 
 Primary Study Hypotheses 
This study is designed to test the nu ll hypothesis that the Clinical Success 
rate at 6 months when using the GORE® Septal Occluder is inferior to the 
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 35  
Doc Type: GC 
lost to follow-up rate of up to 10% before the 6-month endpoint, a minimum 
of 150 subjects will be enrolled in the study.   
 Study Enrollment 
Enrollment in the GORE® Septal Occluder study will occur in three phases: 
1.Pivotal co hort of 50 subjects from a maximum of 10 sites.
Enrollment in this phase will begi n upon Investigational De vice
Exemption (IDE) approval. Upon completion of 6 month follow up
for all 50 su
bjects, a submission will be made to FDA for Pre-
Market Approval (PMA).
2.Continued Access cohort of 100 – 350 subjec ts from 10 – 21 (up to
11 additional) sites.  Enrollment in  this phase will begin after FDA
acceptance of 30-day safety analys
is on the Pivotal cohort .
3.Post Appr
oval cohort of subjects will be enrolled depending on the
number achieved in Continued Acc
ess upon PMA approval.
Enrollment in this phase will begi n after FDA pr e-market approval
for GORE® Septal Occluder. (Post Approval  Study [PAS] subjects
will be enrolled pursuant to the approval of this protocol and PMA.)
Total enrollment for the GORE® Septal Occluder study will be 150 – 400 
subjects.  All subjects will be enrolled and followed under the same criteria 
through the 36 months post index procedure. 
Data Analysis 
Timing of Analyses  
There are three planned analyses for the GORE® Septal Occluder study: 
1.A safety an alysis on the pivotal cohort of 50 subjects at completion
of 30 day Screening follow-up.  This analysis will support
expansion of enrollment into the c
ontinued access phase.   This will
be a descriptive analysis with no hypothesis t
esting.
2.A PMA submission analysis on the pivotal cohort of 50 subjects at
completion of 6-month follow-up.  This analysis will support pre-market approval of the GORE
® Septal Occluder.  This will be a
descriptive analysis with no hypothesis testing.
3.The final study analysis at completion of enrol lment of all subjects
and completion of 36-month (3-year) foll ow-up.  This analysis will
evaluate the primary study hypothesis.
 Analysis Populations 
The analysis populations for the study are: 
Per-Protocol (primary analysis population) – this population
will include enrolled subjects wh o had no inclusion/exclusion
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 36  
Doc Type: GC 
violations and who complete evaluation through the 6-month 
follow-up.   
Intent-to-treat – this population will include all enrolled
subjects.
Statistical Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint analysis will be a comparison of the proportion of 
subjects w
ho meet the composite Clinical Success requirements 
through the 6-month follow-up between the study population and the 
historical control population of GORE® HELEX Septal Occluder studies.  
The primary analysis population will be  the per-protocol population.  The 
primary endpoint will be compared using a two-sample binomial 
proportions test with a non-inferior ity margin of 10%.  In statistical 
terms: 
TT T
CC CT C

) 1 ( ) 1 (
where: 
pC = observed Clinical Success proportion at 6 months in control group 
nC = number of subjects with primary endpoint evaluation in control 
group 
pT = observed Clinical Success proportion at 6 months in test group 
nT = number of subjects with primar y endpoint evaluation in test group 
The test statistic z is assumed to ha ve a standard Normal distribution.  
Based on the alpha ≤0.05 criterion, a result of z< -1.64 will result in 
rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis and a conclusion that the GORE
® Septal Occluder is not inferior to the current 
GORE® HELEX Septal Occluder. 
Statistical Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The study is not designed to evaluate statistical hypotheses for the secondary endpoints.  Therefore, no analyses are planned for the secondary endpoints.  Any analyses would be c
onsidered exploratory.  
Secondary endpoints will be presented as descriptive statistics. 
Evaluation of Poolability of Pr esence vs. Absenc e of Atrial 
Septal Aneurysm 
Although the fraction of subjects enro lled with an atrial septal aneurysm 
(ASA) is expected to be small (perhaps 1 in 10) it is an important characteristic of ASD, and thus as  a regulatory requirement will be 
MD134520 GSO 10-09 PROT Revision#: 7 Doc Type: SP 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION   
MD133246 Protocol Template Revision#: 1 Page 37  
Doc Type: GC 
assessed for poolability with data from subjects without ASA. The 
statistical plan for this assessment will consist of two stages: baseline homogeneity and primary outcome comparability. 
For baseline homogeneity, the two subgroups will be compared on the 
following three baseline demographic and predictor covariates: age, gender, and balloon-sized ASD diam eter. These subgroup comparisons 
will use the two-sample t-test, chi-square test, or Fisher’s Exact test, depending on the distribution of the covariate. 
For primary outcome comparability, co variate-by-ASA interactions will be 
assessed using logistic regression models where main effects for ASA 
and the covariate and the covariate-by-ASA interaction term will be regressed on the 6-month Clinical Success endpoint; this will be performed individually for each of the three baseline covariates. 
Statistically significant interactions will be assessed graphically for the 
nature of the interaction (quantitative vs. qualitative). Qualitative interactions (difference in direction of ASA effect across levels of covariate) will suggest that the ASA subgroups are not poolable, leading to analyses performed separately for each ASA subgroup. 
Finally, ASA subgroup and any baseline covariates deemed to be 
different between ASA subgroups will be included as main effects in a logistic regression model on the primary endpoint. If the ASA subgroup term is statistically significant then the ASA subgroups will not be considered outcome comparable, leading to analyses performed 
separately for each ASA subgroup. 
A significance level of =0.15 will be used for these poolability tests, 
without correction for multiplicity. Since this evaluation plan calls for a 
minimum of 7 significance tests, the overall Type-I error rate for this analysis may exceed 1 − (1 −  0.15)
7 = 0.67.

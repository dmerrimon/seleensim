 Introduction and Purpose: Th is study will assess the safety and efficacy of fractional CO2 
laser  treatment for Poikiloderma of Civatte (POC). POC is a chronic vascular and pigmentary 
disorder typically involving the lateral and inferior neck region , as well as the chest area. 
Clinically, poikiloderma appears as a combination of telangiectasia, irregular pigmentation, and 
atrophic c hanges
1.  Previously studied effective treatments of POC include pulsed dye lasers and 
IPL devices.2,3,4,5 Ineffective treatments include hydroquinone, electrosurgery, argon laser 
photocoagulation, and cryotherapy.6 Although PDL and IPL laser technologies are relatively 
safe, there have been a few reports of PDL treatment with subsequent complications,  which may 
include ulceration developing immediately after treatment as well as scarring .7,8,9, 10Additionally,

STU2020-0827, Goff, FormA-ResearchProtocol, NS, 09-09-20 (3)  PDL and IPL laser treatments require multiple sessions before seeing a clinically significant 
effect and do not address textural issues.11 Therefore,  alternative safe and effective options for 
management of POC are still needed . Fractional CO2 laser has been widely used for photoaging 
due to its effectiveness and high safety profile.12,13 Clinically evident improvement can be 
appreciated even after only one session of treatment.13 
One previous study showed that ablative fractional laser resurfacing  was both safe and effective 
for the treatment of the vascular, pigmentary and textural components of POC.14  Little data exist 
regarding the use of fractional CO2 laser for management of POC. This study hopes to fulfill this 
purpose.  2. Background Poikiloderma of Civ atte (POC) is characterized by vascular and pigmented lesions consisting of 
linear telangiectasias, mottled dyspigmentation and superficial atrophy in a reticular pattern found on sun-exposed areas of the face and neck, oft en sparing the shaded, submental area.
15,16 
Fair-skinned women in their 4th and 7th decades of life are predominantly affected.15  Most 
cases are benign and asymptomatic, however, some report symptoms of pruritus, burning sensation and flushing triggered by sun exposure.
15 The cosmetically unappealing lesions can be 
distressing to affected individuals. The cause of POC is multifacto rial. Chronic sun exposure,

disease has a chronic and unrelenting course, effective treatments have not been fully 
established. The goal of treatment is to target both the vascular and pigmented lesions to improve symptoms and appearances. Current treatments that yield satisfying results include pulse dye laser, fractional non- ablative photothermolysis, and intense pulsed light.
15, 18,19,20,21,22 However, 
these therapies may induce crusting, purpura, blisters, hypopigmentation and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. 
18, 20,21,23,24 Multiple sessions are often needed to achieve desired cosmetic 
results.   
Carbon dioxide laser was introduced for skin resurfacing in the mid -1990s . It has a wavelength 
of 10,600 nm, has an absorbing chromophore of water, and is used to vaporize tissue. It was initially used as a full- field laser resurfacing device which removes the entire skin surface in the 
area being tr eated. In 2004, Manstein et al. introduced the concept of fractional photothermolysis 
in which only small fraction of the skin would be treated at each session, leaving skip areas in 
between.
25 For the traditional full field laser resurfacing, healing occu rs from deeper structures 
alone; however, fractionated  laser resurfacing  has the advantage of healing from deeper

lowers risk of pigment disturbance or scarri ng.11 Non-ablative fractional devices such as the 
1,550 nm wavelength Erbium fiber laser was used for treatment of POC which showed some 
clinical  improvement in the degree of erythema, dyschromia, and overall texture of the neck with 
very little adverse ef fects.21 Fractional ablative resurfacing with carbon dioxide intends to 
provide more significant results than non- ablative systems, while achieving shorter healing times 
and complications when compared with full- field ablative systems. While fractional CO2  laser 
has been used for successful management of acne scars, facial skin rejuvenation , benign nevus, 
seborrheic keratosis, syringoma, xanthelasma, recalcitrant warts, its efficacy has not been widely proven for management of POC.
27 This study hopes to fill that  knowledge gap in order to best 
optimize treatments for future patients.  
3. Concise summary of project 
 The study subjects’ neck and décolletage area will be divided into two equal halves. The line of 
division will be from the mid mental protuberance to manubriosternal junction. One half of the 
neck and upper chest area will be treated with ablative fractional CO2 laser while the  other half 
will be untreated and used as a control. If desired after the study endpoint, patients may have the other side of their neck treated at no additional charge. Primary Outcome Measures:  
Physician's Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale  at 12- and 24- weeks post treatment. 
Photographs will be presented to a panel of independent dermatologists. The panel will be blinded to treatment parameters and the treatment laterality at each photograph time point. Each

paired images for all subjects. Reviewers will rate improvement in POC in 10% increments on a 
10-point scale (0% no improvement to 100% or complete clearance)  
Secondary Outcome Measures  
Subject Satisfaction Assessment at 12 - and 24- weeks p ost treatment.  Subjects will assess overall 
satisfaction  with improvement of poikiloderma of civatte using an 5- point satisfaction  and 
aesthetic scale.  
Study subjects will be followed for 24 weeks  post- laser  treatment to assess i ncidence and 
severity of a ll procedure -related adverse events.  
4. Study procedures  
 
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of POC defined by a skin change with atrophy, 
hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, dilation of the fine blood vessels (telangiectasia) will be 
recruited. T en patients will be consented. Before the initial visit, all patients will complete a one-
month preoperative daily use of SPF 50+ sunscreen.  The sun protection is to reduce further sun damage and protect skin from increased photosensi tivity that may occur after laser resurfacing. 
At the initial visit, high resolution photographs of the affected area on the neck and décolletage area will be taken.  All patients will fill out a form with demographic information. Patients will be 
instructe d to come to their appointment with clean skin and without any lotions or moisturizers 
on the neck or décolletage area. Laser -specific eyewear will be provided to practitioners, 
patients, and all other people in the treatment room. A blue skin marking pen will be used to draw a line from mid mental protuberance to manubriosternal junction to divide tested area into two equal halves. Compounded benzocaine, lidocaine, and tetracaine (BLT) cream  in a 20:8:4% 
concentration  will be applied to the treatment area for 40 minutes prior to the procedure. Before 
STU2020-0827, Goff, FormA-ResearchProtocol, NS, 09-09-20 (3)  the treatment, topical anesthesia will be thoroughly washed off with chlorhexidine gluconate and 
distilled water. One  pass with a 1 -mm spot density and a 60micron depth will be performed 
followed by a 1mm spot density and a 200-micron depth will be used.  The  other half of the 
testing area will be left intact and used as the control for easy comparison. The side that undergoes treatment will be selected randomly. Forced cold air (Zimmer cooler) will also be used in conjunction with the laser device for better patient comfort.  
Cold compress es with refrigerated distilled water  can be used to reduce swelling and to soothe 
the skin with frequent reapplication of white petrolatum to keep the skin coated for days 1 -5 
post- procedure with strict sun avoidance for the first week post-procedure. Daily use of broad-
spectrum sunscreen with SPF50+ will be required  after the first week .  
Give n the current pandemic, l imited in -person follow- ups will be scheduled (once at baseline 
before treatment, then at 12 and 24- weeks post -treatment. Participants will communicate 
immediate post-treatment issues or concerns along with selfies through MyChart on day 2, 3, 7, 
10, 14 to track progress and to identify any post procedural complications in a timely fashion. 
There will also be no costs to the patients for the laser  procedures as funding will be supplied by 
the UT Southwestern Dermatology department via an educational grant .  Patients desiring 
treatment of the control side after the study end -point (24 weeks) will be provided at no cost for 
the participants.

8. Sources of Research Material  
 Sources of materials used during this study will include data collected from patient surveys, data 
collected from blinded dermatologists’ assessment, and pictures taken of the participants. These 
materials and data will be obtained at each patient visit. Given the current pandemic, only limited in-person follow- ups will be scheduled (once at baseline before treatment, then at 12 weeks, 24 
weeks). Participants will communicate immediate pos t-treatment issues or concerns along with 
selfies through MyChart on day 2, 3, 7, 10, 14 to track progress and to identify any post procedural complications in a timely fashion. Materials and data gathered will be obtained specifically for research purposes, and no existing records or specimens will be used.  
 
9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process  Subjects will be identified from patients presenting to the dermatology department at UT 
Southwestern. When a patient with POC  is identified, they will be offered inclusion in the study. 
Informed consent will be obtained. Both English and non-English speaking patients will be included. If the patient is non-English speaking, a certified translator will be used to obtain consent. Each patient will be informed that he or she has the right to withdraw consent and terminate participation in the study at any point if he or she so desires. No vulnerable populations (cognitively impaired, institutionalized, children) will be included in the study to minimize the risk of undue influence or coercion.  
10. Potential Risks:  
STU2020-0827, Goff, FormA-ResearchProtocol, NS, 09-09-20 (3)  • Ocular – severe ocular complications such as corneal ulceration and cataract could 
happen with any laser devices. Therefore, CO2 laser specific eyewear will be provided to everyone in the treatment room. Ocular complication for this study should be low since we are mainly  targeting the neck and upper chest area instead of the facial area.   
• Pain – Topical anesthesia, and a forced- air cooling device will be used to help patients 
tolerate the procedure . Prolonged severe pain postoperatively may indicate other 
complications s uch as infection  infection and patient should contact the investigators and 
will be examined in -person to determine the cause.  
• Infection – patients will be counseled on signs of infection such as increased erythema, 
purulence, oozing and crusting. Patients will submit electronic selfies of the treatment 
area electronically to investigators on day 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10.  Investigators will contact patients if any signs of infection are identified. For patients with skin infection within the past 6 months, topica l mupirocin ointment TID applied to the nares will be prescribed  to 
prevent staph colonization.  
• Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation: This usually happen less frequently in lighter skin 
types which are the groups most commonly affected by POC.  However, should this occur, hydroquinone and topical retinoids can be prescribed for the patient at the study end-point to alleviate the dyschromia.  
• Prolonged erythema: if erythema lasts more than 3 weeks postoperatively, a mid -potency 
topical steroid will be prescribed to the patient.  
• Scarring: patients with personal and family history of keloid disease and hypertrophic scar formation will be excluded from the study. If hypertrophic or keloidal scars happen, intralesional steroids will be used to flatten the scars.  
STU2020-0827, Goff, FormA-ResearchProtocol, NS, 09-09-20 (3)  11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring   
 All treatments will be completed at the Dermatology clinics at UT Southwestern where there are 
adequate resources for medical intervention in case of an adverse event such as increased bleeding, pain, or infection. The risk of severe bleeding is minimal and does not warrant the need for spare blood products or type and screening.  
12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality  
The study materials will not be disclosed to any outside persons or entities. Patient surveys collected will be stored securely in files in the dermatology offices and will not be removed from campus.  
13. Potential Benefits  
• Improved overall dyschromia and telangiectasia of the chest and neck area 
• Overall increased patient satisfaction and quality of life 
• Provide patients safe and effective alternative for treatment of discoloration and atroph y 
of neck and chest area which hopefully can be generalized to similar patient populations.  
 
14. Biostatistics 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patient demographics. Count (%) will be used 
for categorical variables; and mean, standard deviation (SD), and range (min/max) will be used 
to summarize continuous variables with approximately normal distrib utions. Skewed continuous 
variables will be summarized by median and interquartile range (IQR). Outcome data will be collected on patient  satisfaction assessment scores and physician’s global aesthetic improvement 
scores, a s well as assessment of adverse events. The Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to 
compare the magnitude of change between the baseline scores and post -intervention scores. The 
Wilcoxon signed rank test will also be used to compare the magnitude of change of the  treated 
STU2020-0827, Goff, FormA-ResearchProtocol, NS, 09-09-20 (3)  area and the co ntrol area .   A p -score of <0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The 
target sample size is 10 people.

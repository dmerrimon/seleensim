Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: Q3 2018 
Estimated date last patient completed : Q2 2020 Phase of development: 2 
 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of TSR -042, bevacizumab, and niraparib, as 
assessed by confirmed objective response rate (ORR), in patients with advanced, relapsed, 
high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have received 1 to 2 prior 
lines of anticancer  therapy, are poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) polymerase (PARP) 
inhibitor-naïve, and have platinum -resistant but not refractory disease.  
Secondary: 
• To evaluate the following measures of clinical benefit for TSR -042, bevacizumab, and 
niraparib in patients with advanced, relapsed, high -grade ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer who have received 1 to 2 prior lines of anticancer  therapy, are PARP 
inhibitor-naïve, and have platinum -resistant but not refractory disease:  
o Progression -free survival (PFS)  
o Overall survival (OS)  
o Duration of response (DOR)  
o Disease control rate (DCR)  
• To evaluate safety and tolerability in patients treated with  TSR-042, bevacizumab, and 
niraparib.  
Exploratory:  
• To identify potential biomarkers including breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) status, 
homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene status, homologous recombination deficiency 
(HRD) score, programmed de ath-ligand 1 (PD -L1) expression, and other disease -related or 
treatment -related biomarkers that would associate with tumor responses to the combination of 
niraparib, TSR -042, and bevacizumab based on the molecular profile of tumor tissue, blood, 
and option al ascitic fluid samples.  
• To evaluate the evolution of the molecular profile of the tumor and tumor microenvironment in 
response to treatment.

Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 6 of 58 Methodology:  
The overall study design is described in the master protocol.  
In this cohort, all patients will receive treatment with TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib  
(collectively referred to as “study treatment”) beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1 using the regimen detailed 
in the figure below.  
The safety, tolerability, and maximum to lerated dose of combination treatment with TSR-042, 
bevacizumab, and niraparib  is currently being assessed in ongoing Study  3000-01-002 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . If results from that study are not available at the initiation of treatment for this 
cohort, an interim s afety analysis, which will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan, will be 
performed after a total of 12 patients are enrolled between Cohorts A and B and have completed 
2 cycles of ther apy. If results from Study  3000-01-002 are available and support  the feasibility of the 
outlined starting dose regimens, the safety interim analysis will not be performed.  
Cohort A Study Schema  
 
TSR-042 
500 mg on Day 1 Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by 1,000 mg every other cycle (Q6W) beginning on Cycle 5 
Day 1 until PD o r toxicity

progression. Patients with primary platinum -refractory disease as defined by those who 
progressed during or within 4 weeks of completion of first platinum -based chemotherapy are 
not eligible.  
A2. Patient must not have received any prior therapy for ovarian cancer with a PARP inhibitor  
A3. Patient has had 1 to 2 prior lines of anticancer therapy for ovarian cancer  (The definition of 
prior lines of therapy is provided  in section 8.1, inclusions 3 of the master protocol ).

anticoagulatio n for more than 3 months prior to enrollment are eligible for this study.  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 8 of 58 Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration:  
On days on which more than one  study treatment is administered, TSR -042 will be administered first, 
followed by bevacizumab, and then niraparib, as applicable.  
TSR-042: 
TSR-042 will be administered via a 30 -minute intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 every 3 weeks 
(Q3W) at 500  mg for 4 c ycles followed by 1,000 mg every other cycle (every 6 weeks) beginning on 
Cycle 5 Day  1. The Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the packaging of TSR -042 and 
instructions for the preparation and administration of TSR -042. 
Bevacizumab:  
Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg will be administered via IV infusion on Day 1 of every 21 -day cycle Q3W for 
up to 15 months. The Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the packaging of bevacizumab and 
instructions for the preparation and administration of bevacizumab.  
Niraparib:  
Niraparib will be supplied as 100 -mg capsules and will be administered orally once daily continuously 
throughout each 21 -day cycle at the assigned dose. The starting dose will be 300 mg in patients with a 
screening actual body weight ≥77 kg AND screening p latelet count ≥150,000/μL, and 200  mg in 
patients with a screening actual body weight <77 kg OR screening platelet count <150,000/μL. On or 
after Cycle  3 Day 1, patients receiving the 200 -mg niraparib starting dose may have their niraparib 
dose increased  to 300 mg daily after discussion with medical monitor or designee if hemoglobin is ≥9 
g/dL, platelets are ≥100,000/µL, and neutrophils are ≥1500/µL for all laboratory evaluations performed 
during the first 2  cycles. Patients will be instructed to take nirap arib at the same time each day. 
Bedtime administration may be a potential method for managing nausea. Patients must swallow and 
not chew all capsules. The consumption of water and food is permissible. Niraparib will be dispensed 
to patients on Day 1 of eve ry cycle (every 21 days) until the patient discontinues study treatment. The 
Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the packaging of niraparib and instructions for the 
preparation and administration of niraparib.  
Duration of treatment:  
Treatment with T SR-042 and niraparib will continue until disease progression or toxicity. Treatment 
with bevacizumab will continue for a maximum of 15 months in the absence of disease progression or 
toxicity. Unless otherwise indicated, treatment with each combination age nt will continue independent 
of dose adjustments, interruptions, or discontinuation of treatment for other combination agents . 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Not applicable.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Efficacy endpoints are described in the master protocol.  
Safety: 
Safety endpoints are described in the master protocol.  
Biomarkers:  
Tumor tissue, blood, and optional ascitic fluid samples will be assessed to identify potential 
biomarkers including BRCA status, HRR gene status, HRD score, PD -L1 expression, and other 
disease-related or treatment -related biomarkers that would associate with tumor responses to the 
combination of TSR -042, bevacizumab, and niraparib. Additionally, samples will be assessed to 
evaluate the evolution of the molecular profile of the tumor and tumor microenvironment in response 
to treatment.  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 9 of 58 Statistical methods:  
Sample size calculation was performed using SAS® version 9.4 with the EXACT method. A sample 
size of approximately 40 patients is estimated for this cohort to provide assessment of clinical activity 
of the treatment based on ORR. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is ≤25% (H0: p  ≤ 0.25) 
will be tested against a 1 -sided altern ative of ≥45% (Ha:  p ≥ 0.45). If there are 15 or more responses 
observed among 40 treated patients, it will be concluded that the lower bound of 80 % confidence 
interval excludes H 0 and the null hypothesis will be rejected. With 40 patients treated, the coh ort has 
87% power to rule out a ≤25% ORR (null hypothesis) when the true ORR is 45% at the 10% type I 
error rate (1 -sided). 
Enrollment will be stratified based on histology (epithelial vs carcinosarcoma). Enrollment of patients 
with carcinosarcoma will be limited to comprise approximately 10% of the cohort (ie,  approximately 
4 patients).  
Statistical methods are further described in the master protocol.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel combinations of  
niraparib and agents with strong scientific rationale for synergistic activity in patients with 
recurrent ovarian cancer. An introduction to the overall study is provided in the master protocol.  
Most patients with ovarian cancer present with advanced disease at diagno sis, and the majority 
of these patients will relapse after initial treatment. Recurrence within 6 months of platinum -
based chemotherapy is defined as platinum -resistant disease, which confers a significantly worse 
prognosis, with median overall survival (O S) reported in clinical studies ranging from less than a 
year to 19  months.1, 2, 3, 4 Current treatment options for patien ts with recurrent platinum -resistant 
ovarian cancer (PROC) provide only modest benefit. The National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network guidelines recommend nonplatinum -based regimens such as docetaxel, oral etopside, 
gemcitabine, paclitaxel with or without pazo panib, liposomal doxorubicin with or without 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel/bevacizumab, or topotecan with and without bevacizumab.5 For patients 
who have a breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation, the guidelines recommend 
olaparib and rucaparib.5 Use of a single chemotherapeutic agent will yield a reported objective 
response rate (ORR) in the range of 10% to 30%, with relatively short -lived responses of less 
than 8 months.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 The anti-angiogenesis agent bevacizumab has a modest single -agent 
activity with an ORR of 15% and a median progression -free survival (PFS) of 4.4  months 
reported for patients with PROC.13 A more recent randomized Phase 2 study evaluated paclitaxel 
with or without the anti -angiogenic agent pa zopanib in patien ts with PROC who had received 
1 to 2 prior lines of therapy, yielding ORRs of 56% and 25% and median PFSs of 6.4 and 
3.5 months, respectively.4 Chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab was evaluated in a 
Phase 3 study that demonstrated a median PFS of 3.4 months with chemotherapy alone versus 
6.7 months with combination of chemotherapy with bevacizumab, ORR (by Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 11.8% versus 27.3%, respectivel y.3 A 
post-hoc analysis  of this study  suggested somewhat better outcomes in the paclitaxel and 
bevacizumab -treated patients (ORR of 53% and median PFS of 10.4 months).14 Based on these 
results, bevacizumab in combination with paclit axel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or 
topotecan was approved for the treatment of platinum -resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.15 
The objective of this cohort (Cohort A) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the novel 
combination of TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib  in patients with recurrent PROC not 
previously exposed to treatment with poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) polymerase 
(PARP) inhibitors  who had 1 to 2 prior lines of therapy . 
5.1. Background  
5.1.1. Background of TSR -042 
TSR-042 is an immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 -κ humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high 
affinity to programmed death -1 (PD-1), resulting in inhibition of  binding to programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed death -ligand 2 (PD -L2). This antibody was generated 
based on a proprietary platform that utilizes affinity maturation to select highly -specific 
antibodies with desired functional characteristics.  The functional antagonist activity of TSR -042 
was confirmed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, demonstrating enhanced interleukin -2 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 18 of 58 (IL-2) production upon addition of TSR -042. Furthermore, TSR -042 has an acceptable safety 
profile based on toxicology st udies in cynomolgus monkeys. Additional information on the 
nonclinical and clinical experience with TSR -042 can be found in the TSR -042 Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
5.1.1.1. Nonclinical Experience  
TSR-042 binds with high affinity to human and cynomolgus monkey PD -1. TSR-042 blocks 
binding of soluble ligands to human PD -1 expressed on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary 
cells, with a 50% maximum inhibitory concentration of approximately 1  nM. TSR-042 enhances 
T cell activation, as measured by the production of IL -2 from activated CD4+ T  cells, with a 
50% maximum effective concentration of approximately 1  nM. Full PD -1 receptor occupancy 
achieved by TSR -042 in human and cynomolgus monkey T  cells from peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells was determined to occur at concentrat ions of approximately 1  μg/mL. 
Linear pharmacokinetic (PK) was observed for TSR -042 over the dose range tested of 10  mg/kg 
to 100 mg/kg. Sex had no effect on exposure. The volume of distribution at steady state was low 
and suggested minimal tissue penetrat ion, which is commonly observed for therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies. Weekly administration resulted in approximately 2 - to 3-fold increase in 
TSR-042 exposure.  
In a 4-week repeat -dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, a dministration of TSR -042 at 
doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg was well tolerated and did not result in any treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) on clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, electrocardiograms, 
ophthalmology, safety pharmacology parameters, clinical pathology, gross pathology, organ 
weight, or histopathology. The no -observed-adverse-effects level was ≥100  mg/kg in this study.  
In a 13-week repeat -dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, weekly IV TSR-042 at 
doses of 0, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg was well tolerated  at 30 and 100 mg/kg. One male 
(10 mg/kg/week) was euthanized because of chronic, unresolved generalized skin findings 
associated with swollen and firm inguinal lymph nodes on both sides. Terminal necropsies of the 
remaining animals showed microscopic find ings of an immune -mediated nature in the kidney, 
liver, and heart in animals dosed with TSR -042 at ≥10 mg/kg/week . Although these findings are 
commonly observed in cynomolgus monkeys, the severity of these findings was slightly 
increased in TSR -042-dosed animals compared to control animals. Considering the mechanism 
of action of TSR -042, these microscopic findings could be a result of the pharmacological effects 
of TSR-042. Because of the euthanasia of 1 male dosed in the 10  mg/kg dose group, the NOAEL 
could not be determined in this study.  
5.1.1.2. Clinical Experience  
TSR-042 has been evaluated as monotherapy in one Phase 1 study to date. Study 4010 -01-001 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  is an ongoing first -in-human Phase 1 study of TSR -042 to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability, PK , pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of TSR -042 in patients with 
advanced solid tumors. The study is being conducted in 2 parts:  
• Part 1 (dose escalation) of the study used a modified 3 + 3 design to evaluate 
3 ascending weight -based doses of TSR -042 as follows: 1, 3, and 10  mg/kg 
administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) via IV infusion.  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 19 of 58 • Part 2 of the study is being conducted in 2 subparts (Part 2A and Part 2B) to explore 
the safety and clinical activity of TSR -042 administered as a fixed dose (ie, not 
weight based). 
 In Part 2A, following the completion of Part 1, the safety and tolerability of 
TSR-042 was evaluated at fixed doses of 500 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) and 
1,000 mg every 6 weeks (Q6W) using a modified 6  + 6 design.  
 In Part 2B, the clinical activity, to lerability, and safety of TSR -042 at the 
recommended Phase 2 dose will be evaluated in patients with specific tumor 
types.  
As of 21 January 2018, 135  subjects with heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors have been 
treated with TSR -042 in Study 4010 -01-001: 21 subjects in Part 1 and 114 subjects in Part 2A 
and 2B. The majority of these subjects (92.6%) reported at least 1  treatment -emergent adverse 
event (TEAE), with events of fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite being the most frequently 
reported. Stud y drug-related TEAEs of Grade ≥  3 were reported in 13 subjects (9.6%). The 
majority of these events occurred in only 1 subject each, with the exception of aspartate 
aminotransferase increased (3  subjects), alanine aminotransferase increased (2  subjects), a nd 
fatigue (2 subjects). Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 38 subjects (28.1%), for 5 of 
these subjects the event was considered study drug -related. Eight subjects had an adverse event 
(AE) leading to study drug discontinuation. Six  subjects had an  AE leading to study drug 
discontinuation which was considered study drug -related. Three subjects had an AE leading to 
death. None of the AEs leading to death were considered to be related to the study drug.  
TSR-042 is also being studied in combination wit h other treatments, including  TSR-022, an anti -
TIM3 antibody (4020 -01-001) and TSR-033, an anti -LAG3 antibody (4040 -01-001). As of 
January 2018, 28 subjects received TSR -042 in combination with TSR -022 in Study 4020 -01-
001.  
5.1.2. Background of Bevacizumab  
Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic recombinant humanized monoclonal Ig G1 antibody against 
the vascular endothelial growth factor protein. Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech/Roche United 
States [US]) has been approved in the US and European Union (EU) for the t reatment of multiple 
tumor types in combination with certain other treatments. In the EU, bevacizumab is approved 
for the front -line treatment of adult patients with advanced (International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics Stages IIIB, IIIC, and IV)  ovarian cancer. In the US, bevacizumab is 
approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer that is either platinum -resistant (in combination with paclitaxel, pegylated 
liposomal doxorub icin, or topotecan) or platinum -sensitive (in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel or in carboplatin and gemcitabine, followed by Avastin as a single agent).  
Bevacizumab has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies, including in 361 patients with  
recurrent PROC as part of a Phase 3 study (AURELIA).3, 14 Patients receiving bevacizumab 
administered concurrently with single -agent chemotherapy (N=179) showed statistically 
significant improvement in PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (6.7 months vs 3.4  months; 
hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; p < 0.001) and statistica lly significant improvement in objective 
response rate (ORR) compared to chemotherapy alone (30.9% vs 12.6%; 95% confidence 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 20 of 58 interval [CI], 9.6 -27.0; p < 0.001, by RECIST and/or Gynecology Cancer Intergroup  cancer 
antigen 125 criteria). 
Statistically signif icant improvement with bevacizumab was observed regardless of 
chemotherapy regimen (paclitaxel: 10.4 months vs 3.9 months; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30 -0.71; 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin: 5.4 months vs 3.5 months; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39 -0.83; and 
topotecan: 5 .8 months vs 2.1 months; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21 -0.49). 
Safety observations in this study were consistent with the safety profile of bevacizumab. 
Grade ≥2 hypertension and proteinuria were observed more frequently with bevacizumab than 
with chemotherapy alo ne. No new safety signals were observed.  
5.1.3. Background of Niraparib  
Overall clinical experience with niraparib is summarized in the master protocol.  
5.1.4. Background of Combination of TSR -042 and Niraparib  
5.1.4.1. Nonclinical Experience  
The efficacy and tolerability of nir aparib in combination with anti -PD-1 therapy was evaluated in 
several nonclinical models. The combination was well tolerated in all of these studies. The 
combination was first tested in a homologous recombination -deficient ovarian cancer mouse 
model derive d from breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA) null genetic background16, as 
PARP inhibition was previously shown to increase immune cell infiltration in BRCA-deficient 
models.17 In a study of an ovarian carcinoma mouse model18, niraparib (50  mg/kg orally [PO] 
once daily [QD]) and anti -mouse programmed death -1 (mPD-1; 5 mg/kg intraper itoneally twice 
weekly [BIW]) were administered to mice either alone or in combination for 16  days. The 
combination was tolerated with no treatment -related death. Almost all the tumors achieved 
complete regression upon treatment with niraparib, anti -mPD-1, and the combination. Complete 
regression was first observed on treatment Day 16 in 2 of 6, 1 of 6, and 4  of 6 mice from the 
niraparib, anti -mPD-1, and combination groups, respectively. These results suggest that the 
therapeutic approach of combining nirap arib with a PD -1 inhibitor such as TSR -042 may provide 
additional benefit for patients with homologous recombination -deficient tumors.  
Niraparib and anti -PD-1 combination treatment has also been evaluated in several syngeneic 
models representing breast ca ncer 1 and breast cancer 2 ( BRCA1/2) wild-type tumors, 1 of which 
was the breast cancer mouse model LPA1 -T22. In study of a syngeneic transplant breast cancer 
model, niraparib (50 mg/kg PO QD) and anti -PD-1 antibody (10 mg/kg IV BIW) were 
administered to m ice either alone or in combination for 15 days. While these tumors were 
moderately responsive to niraparib or anti -PD-1 antibody alone, with average tumor growth 
inhibition of approximately 50% for niraparib and 30% for PD -1 antibody, synergistic anti -tumor 
activity with near -complete tumor growth inhibition (>95%) was achieved with the 
combination.19 In a similar study using the lung squamous syngeneic model KLN205, stronger 
tumor growth inhibition was observed for the combination (52.3%) than for niraparib alone 
(36.7%) or anti -PD-1 alone (30.5%).20 Together, these data support the therapeutic approach of 
combining niraparib with an anti -PD-1 agent. 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 21 of 58 5.1.4.2. Clinical Experience  
Combination treatment with TSR -042 and niraparib is currently being assessed in ongoing 
Study 3000-01-002 (NCT03307 785); no clinical data are currently available for TSR -042 and 
niraparib combination treatment.  
Niraparib is also being evaluated in combination with another anti -PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, 
in patients with triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) or recurrent PROC as part of a Phase 1/2 
study (TOPACIO/KEYNOTE -162).21  
In Phase 1 of the study, 5 patients with TNBC and 9 patients with recurrent PROC received 
200 mg pembrol izumab via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle and 200  mg 
(Dose Level 1) or 300 mg (Dose Level 2) niraparib per day orally. DLTs included neutropenia, 
anemia, and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient at Dose Level  1 and thrombocytopenia in 2 patients at 
Dose Level 2. The recommended Phase 2 dose regimen was determined to be 200 mg niraparib 
per day orally (increasing to 300 mg after Cycle 2 in patients with no significant hematologic 
toxicities) in combination with 200  mg pembrolizumab via IV infusion on Day  1 of each 21 -day 
cycle. Tumor responses included partial response or complete response in 5 of the 9 patients with 
recurrent PROC; the remaining 4  patients had stable disease.  
In Phase 2 of the study as of August 2017, no new safety signals have been obs erved. In 
36 patients with recurrent PROC, the most frequently reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs were anemia 
(16.7%), fatigue and platelet count decreased (5.6% each), and thrombocytopenia (2.8%).  
5.1.5. Background of Combination of Bevacizumab and Niraparib  
The combinati on of a PARP inhibitor and an angiogenesis inhibitor has the potential for 
improved PFS benefits in patients with or without homologous recombination deficiency (HRD).  
Tumor cells with a deficiency in homologous recombination are exquisitely sensitive to PARP 
inhibitors due to synthetic lethality. It has been observed that, for tumors without genetic or 
epigenetic defects in homologous recombination  pathway genes, a func tional state of HRD may 
be induced by hypoxia through transcriptional downregulation of homologous recombination -
related genes, including RAD51 and BRCA1. In addition, cyclic (acute) hypoxia and 
reoxygenation can induce both single -strand and double -strand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
breaks within tumor cells due to increased levels of reactive oxygen species.22, 23 These 
2 mechanisms working together lead to heightened sensitivity to PARP inhibitors when cells are 
under hypoxic stress exerted by angiogenesis inhibitors. It has been observed that P ARP 
inhibitors selectively induce apoptosis in hypoxic tumor regions  in vivo, supporting the idea of 
contextual synthetic lethality between hypoxia -induced functional HRD and PARP inhibition. In 
the clinical setting, preliminary evidence of clinical effica cy has been observed in patients with 
platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer treated with either niraparib combined with bevaci zumab 
(ENGOT-OV24/AVANOVA trial24) or olaparib combined with cediranib (Phase 2), irrespective 
of their BRCA mutation or HRD status.25 These data provide a strong rationale for combining a 
PARP inhibitor with an angiogenesis inhibitor.  
To validate the hypothesis that tumors without HRD can be effectively treated with the 
combination of niraparib and bevacizumab, the HRD status for pretreatment tumor tissue will be 
determined using the Myriad research HRD assay.  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 22 of 58 The combination of niraparib and bevacizumab treatment is currently being explored in patients 
with recurrent platinum -sensitive ovarian cancer as part of an ongoing Phase 1/2 study 
(AVANOVA).24 Phase 1 of the study (dose escalation) has determined the recommended Phase  2 
dose in this population to be 300 mg niraparib orally once daily and 15  mg/kg bevacizumab via 
IV infusion Q3W. Results to date, although limited, indicate clinical activity of t he combination 
in this patient population.  
Overall, the combination of niraparib and bevacizumab appears to be safe for administration, 
with a manageable safety profile. Adverse events (AEs) observed to date are consistent with 
those of the individual com ponents and are readily managed through routine laboratory testing 
(ie, complete blood count), clinical surveillance (ie, blood pressure monitoring), and adherence 
to the recommended dose modifications.  
5.1.6. Combination of TSR -042, Bevacizumab, and Niraparib  
Combination treatment with TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib  is currently being assessed in 
ongoing Study  3000-01-002 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ; no clinical data are currently available. However, 
the efficacy and safety of the combination of a PD -L1 inhibitor , a PARP inhibitor, and an 
anti-angiogenic agent have been studied in a Phase 1/2 study in women’s cancers.26 Data from 
the study indicates anticancer  activity of the triplet combination, especially in ova rian cancer. At 
the dosing levels explored, the combination was tolerable and hematologic toxicity  and 
cardiovascular toxicity observed in the study were consistent wit h PARP inhibitor -class and 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor treatments, respectively.   
5.2. Rationale for Current Study  
Over recent years, research has revealed the importance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in 
controlling the clinical progression of various cancers, and their presence in a tumor is associated 
with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.27 In ovarian can cer, intraepithelial CD8+ T  cells 
correlated with the presence of mutation or loss of expression of BRCA1 through promoter 
methylation.28 Ovarian cancer patients that were sensitive to agents targeting defects in DNA 
repair are likely to overlap with those tumors with an active yet checkpoint -blocked immune 
response. 
The activity of PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitors observed in ovarian cancer (ORR of 11% to 12% with 
single agent pembrolizumab or avelumab in small studies) has been modest so far.29, 30 However, 
preclinical data suggest there may be synergistic interaction between immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and PARP inhibitors. Nonclinical experiments in syngeneic mouse models have shown 
an increased response rate to the combination of anti -PD-1 and PARP inhibitors over either agent 
alone, providing additional support to investigate this combination in patients.31, 32 Exposure  of a 
tumor in vivo to PARP inhibitor results in increased cancer cell death by 2 independent 
mechanisms. First, through the mechanism of synthetic lethality, the PARP inhibitor can kill 
tumors with HRD through apoptosis. Second, the PARP inhibitor can inc rease the number of 
CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, as well as their production of interferon -γ and tumor 
necrosis factor -α.16, 33 Niraparib has also been shown to enhance immune responses in tumor 
microenvironment via activation of the stimulator of th e interferon gene (STING) pathway, 
which renders tumors immunologically “hot” with an increase in infiltrating lymphocytes, 
resulting in an improved response to checkpoint blockade.31  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 23 of 58 Combination treatment with anti -PD-1 agent pembrolizumab and PARP inhibitor niraparib was 
evaluated in a dose escalation Phase 1b study and was shown to be tolerable with early signs of 
efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors, including ovarian and breast cancers.34 A study 
to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase 2 dose of PD -1 inhibitor TSR -042 
in combination with niraparib (Study 3000 -01-002, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is underway.   
The combination of niraparib and bevacizumab treatment is currently being explored in pati ents 
with recurrent platinum -sensitive ovarian cancer as part of an ongoing Phase 1/2 study 
(AVANOVA) .24 Although limited, results to date indicate clinical activity of the combination in 
this patient population.  
In addition to a strong scientific rat ionale for the combinations of PARP inhibitors with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors as well as antiangiogenic agents, the approach of combining all 
3 mechanism of action was tested in a Phase 1/2 study of olaparib (PARP inhibitor), cediranib 
(anti-angiogenic agent), and durvalumab (PD -L1 inhibitor).35 This 3-drug combination showed 
acceptable safety data and early encouraging anticancer effects, supporting the potential 
synergistic effect of the combination. Among 9 patients treated, 3 (33%) had partial response 
(6, 6 plus, and 7 plus months, respectively) and 4 (44%) had stable disease (3, 7 plus, 9, and 
15 plus months, respectively).36 
Cohorts A and B of the present clinical study are designed to evaluate the  novel triple 
combination of PD -1 inhibitor TSR -042, bevacizumab, and niraparib in the PROC patient 
population, based on the nonoverlapping safety and metabolic profiles and nonclinical and 
clinical data suggesting possible synergy. The safety and tolerability of this combination are 
currently being evaluated in Study  3000-01-002 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , and the results of 
Study 3000-01-002 will further support the justification of the starting dose in Cohort A of the 
current trial.  
Given recent as well as future anticipated approvals of several PARP inhibitors for treatment and 
maintenance in ovarian cancer, the treatment landscape in ovarian cancer will be changing 
significantly. The u se of PARP inhibitors, initially approved for treatment in late lines of 
therapy, is expected to move into maintenance setting in earlier lines, especially for patients with 
BRCA mutation/HRD. However, the efficacy of re -treatment with the same mechanism o f action 
for patients who previously progressed on PARP inhibitors is unknown. Therefore, Cohort A of 
the present protocol will be evaluating the efficacy of TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib  in 
patients with PROC not previously exposed to PARP inhibitio n, while Cohort B will evaluate if 
patients who previously progressed on PARP inhibitors can subsequently respond to a 
combination approach and be resensitized to PARP inhibitors through synergy with bevacizumab 
and PD-1 antibody. Given the expected treatm ent landscape evolution, Cohort A will focus on 
patients with early relapse (1  or 2 prior lines of therapy) , and Cohort B will focus on the PROC 
patient population in later lines of therapy (2 to 3 prior lines  of therapy) .

The overall study design is described in the master protocol.  
In this cohort, all patients will receive treatment with TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib  
(collectively referred to as “study treatment”) beginning on Cycle 1/Day 1 using the regimen 
detailed in Figure 1. 
As described in Section  5.1.6, combination treatment with TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib  
is currently being assessed in ongoing Study  3000-01-002 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . If results from that 
study are not available at the ini tiation of treatment for this cohort, an interim safety analysis will 
be performed after a total of 12 patients are enrolled between Cohorts A and B and have 
completed 2 cycles of therapy. If results from Study 3000 -01-002 are available and support the 
feasibility of the outlined starting dose regimens, the safety interim analysis will not be 
performed.

All patients enrolled in this cohort will receive TSR-042, beva cizumab, and niraparib  as 
indicated in Figure 1. 
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
7.4.1. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses  
Dosing regimens for TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib  are described in Section  7.1. The 
rationale for the starting doses of TSR -042 and niraparib is provided in Section  5.1.4.2; the 
rationale for weight - and platelet -based dosing for niraparib is provided in Section 5.1.2.2 of the 
master protocol. Unless otherwise indicated, treatment with each combination agent will 
continue independent of dose adjustments, interruptions, or discontinuation of treatment for other 
combination agents.  
7.4.1.1. TSR-042 
AEs (both nonserious and serious) associated with TSR -042 exposure may represent an 
immunologic etiology. These AEs may occur shortly a fter the first dose or several months after 
the last dose of treatment.  
In general, TSR -042 must be withheld for drug -related Grade 3 toxicities, as well as for certain 
immune-related adverse events of interest (irAEIs), but may be resumed upon recovery to  
Grade ≤1; TSR-042 will be permanently discontinued for any drug -related Grade 4 AE. TSR -042 
must be permanently discontinued for certain irAEIs as described in Table 2.  
The specific immune -related AEs typically observed with anti -PD-1 antibodies will be managed 
according to the guidelines summarized below.5 
The reason for interruption or discontinuation of TSR -042 should be recorded in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF).  
Immune-related Adver se Events of Interest and Guidelines for Management  
Given the mechanism of action of TSR -042, it is anticipated that activation of cellular immune 
system can be manifested as immune -related AEs. Based on available safety data from 
checkpoint inhibitors, TE AEs with the specific grades listed below were selected as irAEIs. The 
list of irAEIs may be updated upon emerging data.  
Refer to Table 2 for details o n the management of TSR -042 dose delays and discontinuation for 
specific irAEIs. Detailed guidance for the administration of rescue medications and supportive 
care is available in Section  9.2.3. For all irAEIs listed in Table 2, TSR-042 should be withheld 
until the patient is clinically and metabolic ally stable and AEs have resolved to Grade ≤1. If 
systemic steroids are used as a part of irAEI management, the total dose of daily steroids should 
be equal to or less than prednisone 10  mg at the time of resuming TSR -042. 
All treatment delays (including a ny missed doses) and discontinuations, and the reason for delays 
or discontinuation of TSR -042, should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Niraparib

Confidential   Page 27 of 58 Of note, if the attribution of an AE is not clear between TSR -042 and niraparib (examples might 
include diarrhea or aspartate am inotransferase or alanine aminotransferase elevation), both 
agents may be withheld and a discussion with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor is recommended.

b Upon resolution within 1 hour of stopping drug infusion, the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original 
infusion rate (eg, from 100 to 50 mL/h). Otherwise, study treatment will be withheld until symptoms resolve, and 
the patient should be premedicated for the next scheduled dose; refer to Se ction 9.2.3 for further management 
details. 
7.4.1.2. Bevacizumab  
The Investigator is advised to consult the current bevacizumab label. Dose reductions of 
bevacizumab are not permitted in this study.15, 37 
Interrupt bevacizumab treatment for the following AEs: proteinuria, medically significant 
hypertension that cannot be adequately controlled with antihypertensive therapy, hypertension in 
the presence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, development of hypertensive 
crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy, or nephrotic syndrome. In case of uncontrolled 
hypertension, niraparib should also be held in addition to bevacizumab.  
Resume b evacizumab treatment only when 1) hypertension is controlled by hypertensive 
regimen, or 2) urine protein is <2  g per 24 hours urine collection.15 Niraparib should be resumed 
with bevacizumab when hypertension is controlled by hypertensive regimen. If  hypersensitivity 
or infusion reactions occur during bevacizumab infusion, the infusion should be discontinued. 
Except in cases where permanent discontinuation of bevacizumab is indicated, resumption of the 
standard dose of bevacizumab upon resolution of o ther adverse reactions is at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
Bevacizumab treatment should be withheld 4 weeks prior to elective surgery. In patients who 
experience wound healing complications during the study, treatment with bevacizumab should 
be withheld until the wound is fully healed.   
7.4.1.3. Niraparib  
Niraparib Dose I nterruption and Modification  
Treatment must be interrupted for any nonhematologic Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 AE that the Investigator considers to be related to 
administration of niraparib ( Table 3). If the nonhematologic toxicity is appropriately resolved to 
baseline or Grade ≤1 within 4 weeks (28  days) of the dose interruption period, the patient may 
restart trea tment with niraparib but with a dose level reduction if prophylaxis is not considered 
feasible (see Table 4). If the event recurs at a similar or worse  grade, treatment should be 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 29 of 58 interrupted again and, upon resolution, a further dose reduction must be made. No more than 
2 dose reductions will be permitted (ie, to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD).  
If the toxicity requiring dose interruption has not resolved completely or to CTCAE Grade 1 
during the maximum 4 -week (28-day) dose interruption period, or the patient has already 
undergone a maximum of 2 dose reductions (to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD), the patient 
must permanently discontinue treatment with nirapa rib. 
Of note, if the attribution of an AE is not clear between TSR -042 and niraparib (examples might 
include diarrhea or aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase elevation), both 
agents may be withheld and a discussion with the Sponsor’s Medi cal Monitor is recommended.  
The dose interruption and modification criteria for niraparib for hematologic parameters will be 
based on blood counts and are outlined in Table 5. If the hematologic toxicity has not recovered 
to the specified levels within 4 weeks (28 days) of the dose interruption period, or the patient has 
already undergone a maximum of 2 dose reductions (to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD), the 
patient must permanently discontinue treatment with niraparib.

weekly blood draws for CBC will be required for an additional 4 weeks after the AE has 
resolved, after  which monitoring every treatment cycle  may resume.  
Any patient requiring transfusion of platelets or red blood cells (≥1 unit) must undergo a dose 
reduction upon recovery if study treatment is resumed.  
If a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute mye loid leukemia is confirmed by a 
hematologist, the patient must permanently discontinue study treatment.  
For major surgery while on study treatment, up to 4 weeks (28 days) of study treatment 
interruption is allowed.  
Once the dose of study treatment has be en reduced, any re -escalation must be discussed with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  
All dose interruptions and reductions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the 
reductions/interruptions, are to be recorded in the eCRF. Reasons for the discon tinuation of 
niraparib must also be recorded in the eCRF.

7.6. Study Conduct  
7.6.1. Schedule o f Events 
The schedule of study procedures is provided in Table 6. 
7.6.2. Procedures by Visit  
Treatment Cycles  
Treatment cycles are 21  days (± 3 days) long.  
Visits should occur within ±  3 days of the scheduled visit. All times should be recorded using the 
24-hour clock (eg, 23:20, not 11:20 PM).  
Radiographic Evaluation for Primary Outcome  
All patients are required to undergo radiographic evaluation throughout the study as described in 
Table 6. Tumor imaging (chest, abdomen, and pelvis [plus head if clinically indicated]) should 
be performed by computed tomography (CT  with IV contrast unless contraindication ; preferred). 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should only  be used if clinically appropriate, when CT is 
contraindicated, or for imaging of the head, but the same imaging technique should be used in a 
patient throughout the study. CT scan is the more commonly used modality and is preferred for 
the majority of pat ients. Positron emission tomography/CT may be used according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  v1.1 guidelines. If the chest or head CT/MRI is 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 32 of 58 clear at screening, repeat imaging of these areas is not required in the absence of clinic al 
indication requiring follow ‐up. Bone scans should be conducted per standard of care.  
Serum tumor marker data (eg, cancer antigen 125) will not be used for defining objective 
responses or disease progression; however, serum tumor marker data can be used for clinical 
decisions. Response to treatment will be based on Investigator evaluation of radiographic 
images. 
Radiographic evaluations to assess extent of disease will be conducted every 9 weeks (63 days 
± 7 days) while on study treatment, independent of cycle delays or dose interruptions, or at any 
time when progression of disease is suspected. After 1 year of radiographic assessments, patients 
will have imaging performed every 12 weeks (84 ± 14 days). Radiographic evaluations will 
continue until progress ive disease (PD), start of alternate anticancer treatment, withdrawal of 
consent to study participation, becoming lost to follow -up, death, or end of the study. Per 
RECIST v1.1 , complete response or partial response should be confirmed; tumor imaging for 
confirmation of response may be performed at the earliest 4 weeks after the first indication of 
response or at the next scheduled scan (ie,  9 or 12 weeks later), whichever is clinically indicated.  
There is accumulating evidence indicating clinical benefit i n a subset of patients treated with 
immunotherapy despite initial evidence of PD.38 Patients with PD may continue study treatment 
at the Investigator’s discretion only after discussion with the Sponsor, until the Investigator has 
determined that the patient is no longer experiencing clinical benefit or until study treatment is 
no longer tolerated by the patie nt. 
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than PD will continue post -treatment 
imaging studies for disease status follow -up at the same frequency as already followed (ie,  every 
9 weeks [63  ± 7 days] for the first year of treatment and every 12 weeks [84  ± 14 days] 
thereafter) until PD, start of alternate anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent to study 
participation, becoming lost to follow -up, death, or end of the study.  
Biomarker Assessment  
Tumor tissue, blood, and optional asciti c fluid samples will be collected as indicated in Table 6 
to identify potential biomarkers.  
End of Treatment Visit and Safety Follow -up Visit 
All patients will undergo an End of Treatment (EOT) visit within 7  days after study treatment 
discontinuation. A safety follow -up visit will be conducted 30  days (± 7 days) after the last dose 
of study treatment. Safety follow -up visits are required only for those  patients who have not 
started an alternate anticancer therapy. After the 30 -day safety follow -up visit, all patients will 
enter the post -treatment follow -up period of telephone assessment for survival status and the 
occurrence of any treatment -related ser ious adverse events (SAEs) or adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs) every 90  (± 14 days), or as otherwise indicated in Section  12 and the master 
protocol, until patient discontinuation of study, withdrawal of consent, or death. Patients who 
discontinue the study due to treatment toxicity or intolerability and do not hav e PD will continue 
radiographic imaging until PD, start of alternate anticancer treatment,  withdrawal of consent to 
study participation, becoming lost to follow -up, death, or end of the study .

d All patients included in the study must provide blood and tumor samples at screeni ng. Tumor samples provided at screening need to be obtained after most 
recent disease progression or freshly biopsied. All patients included in the study must provide on -treatment tumor (provided it is deemed safe and feasible by 
the Investigator) and bloo d samples. The on -treatment tumor sample must be collected between Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1, preferably from the same 
lesion used for the screening assessment. The blood sample must be collected at the same time (± 3 days) as when on treatment  tumor samples are collected.

9.2.1. Prohibited Medications  
Known prior medications that exclude a patient from participating in this cohort are described in 
the exclusion criteria (see Section  8.2). 
Medications prohibited in the overall study are provided in the master protocol. The following 
additional therapies are prohibited during the screening and treatment phase for this cohort.  
• Investigational agents other than TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to manage symptoms of 
suspected irAEIs. (Note: Use of inhaled steroids, local injection of steroids, topical 
steroids, and steroid eye drops are allowed.) If medically deemed necessary (eg,  acute 
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, prophylaxis for IV 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 40 of 58 contrast if indicated), Investigators are allowed to use their judgment to treat patients 
with systemic steroids. In such cases, systemic steroids should be stopped at least 
24 hours prior to the next dose of TSR -042. 
• Prophylactic cytokines (ie,  granulocyte colony -stimulating factor [GCSF]) should not 
be administered in the first cycle of the study but may be administered in subsequent 
cycles accordi ng to current American Society of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO) 
guidelines.39  
In addition, ni raparib has been shown to weakly indu ce cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in vitro 
and is an insensitive substrate for P -glycoprotein. Th erefore, Investigators and p atients should be  
advised to use caution with drugs that are sensitive substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow 
therapeutic range , such as theophylline and tizanidine. T he niraparib safety profile includes risk 
for thrombocytopenia, and bevacizumab may increase the potential for bleeding (hemorrhage); 
therefore, patients should be  advised to use caution with anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) and 
antiplatelet drugs (eg, aspirin). Physicians should follow the cu rrent versions of the TSR -042 
Investigator’s Brochure, the Zejula® package insert39, the Avastin® [Genentech/Roche US] 
package insert40, and the niraparib Investigator’s Brochure for information on the general 
management of the patients receiving these therapies.  
9.2.2. Contraception  
Contraception guidelines are provided in the master protocol.  
9.2.3. Rescue Medicat ions and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Supportive care measures for AEs during treatment with niraparib should be provided as deemed 
necessary by the treating Investigator according to local institutional practice and/or guidance in 
the appropriate prescribin g information.  
During treatment with TSR -042, patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures 
for AEs as deemed necessary by the treating Investigator, including but not limited to the items 
outlined below. Prophylactic cytokines (eg,  GCSF) should not be administered in the first cycle 
of the study but may be administered in subsequent cycles according to current ASCO 
guidelines.39 Note: It may be necessary to perform additional pro cedures such as bronchoscopy, 
endoscopy, or skin photography as part of the evaluation of the AE. The following sections detail 
specific guidance by type of AE.  
9.2.3.1. Pneumonitis  
• Treat with systemic corticosteroids, oral for Grade 2 (eg, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent) and IV for Grade 3 or 4 (eg, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone 
or equivalent).  
• Administer additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
• Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4  weeks. 
• If Grade 2 and no impr ovement or worsening over 2 weeks, treat as Grade 3 or 4.  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -3000-02-005 Version 1.0   
Confidential   Page 41 of 58 • Consider prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration.  
9.2.3.2. Diarrhea/Colitis  
• Monitor carefully for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as di arrhea, 
abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
• All patients who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient  oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  
• For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists >3 days, administer oral corticosteroids 
(eg, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent). If symptoms persis t or worsen 
with steroids, treat as Grade 3 or 4.  
• For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists >3 days, treat with IV steroids 
(eg, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) followed by high -dose oral 
steroids. 
• Taper corticosteroids when symptoms im prove to Grade ≤1 over ≥4  weeks. 
9.2.3.3. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus or Grade 3 or 4 Hyperglycemia  
For type 1 diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic 
acidosis or ketonuria, insulin replacement therapy is required.  
9.2.3.4. Hypophysitis  
• Treat with systemic corticosteroids, oral for Grade 2 (eg, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent) and IV for Grade 3 or 4 (eg, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone 
or equivalent).  
• Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4  weeks. 
• Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
9.2.3.5. Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism  
Thyroid disorders have been reported with other PD -1 inhibitors occurring at any time during 
treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyro id function (at the start of treatment, periodically 
during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and 
symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
• Grade 2 HYPERthyroidism: Consider nonselective beta -blockers (eg, propranolol) as 
initial therapy.  
• Grade 3 or 4 HYPERthyroidism: Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids 
followed by oral corticosteroids (eg, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent). 
Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4  weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.

11.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are described in the master pro tocol. 
11.3. Biomarker Endpoints  
Tumor tissue, blood, and optional ascitic fluid samples will be assessed to identify potential 
biomarkers including BRCA status, HRR gene status, HRD score, PD -L1 expression, and other 
disease-related or treatment -related biomark ers that would associate with tumor responses to the 
combination of TSR-042, bevacizumab, and niraparib . 
Details on tumor tissue, blood, and optional ascitic fluid sample collection, processing, and 
management can be found in the Study Laboratory Manual. A ny remaining blood and tumor 
tissue samples may be stored for up to 15 years for future biospecimen research, which may 
include biomarker testing.  
Additionally, samples will be assessed to evaluate the evolution of the molecular profile of the 
tumor and tumor microenvironment in response to  treatment.

12.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety parameters for this study are described in the master protocol. 
In addition, urine dipstick  or urine analysis  for protein determination will be performed at 
Screening and prior to each bevacizumab administration. Patients discovered to have 
≥2 proteinuria on dipstick should not be administered bevacizumab, sh ould undergo a 24 -hour 
urine collection, and must demonstrate <2  g of protein in 24  hours to be eligible for bevacizumab 
treatment to resume.  
12.2. Adverse Events and Special Situations  
Guidance on AEs and special situations is provided in the master protocol.  
With regard to AESIs, no AESIs have been reported to date for TSR -042, therefore all serious 
AEs assessed by the Investigator or Sponsor to be reasonably associated with the use of TSR -042 
are considered to be unexpected and should be reported as described in the master protocol. For 
bevacizumab, the local approved product label should be consulted. The AESIs for niraparib are 
described in the master protocol.

An overall description of the statistics for this study is provided in the master protoc ol. 
Additional details are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
13.1. Sample Size Determination  
Sample size calculation was performed using SAS® version 9.4 with the EXACT method.  
A sample size of approximately 40 patients is estimated for this cohort to p rovide assessment of 
clinical activity of the treatment based on ORR. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 
≤25% (H0: p  ≤ 0.25) will be tested against a 1 -sided alte rnative of ≥45% (Ha:  p ≥ 0.45). If there 
are 15 or more responses observed amo ng 40 treated patients, it will be concluded that the lower 
bound of 80 % confidence interval excludes H 0 and the null hypothesis will be rejected. With 
40 patients treated, the cohort has 87% power to rule out a ≤25% ORR (null hypothesis) when 
the true ORR  is 45% at the 10% type I error rate (1 -sided). 
Enrollment will be stratified based on histology (epithelial vs carcinosarcoma). Enrollment of 
patients with carcinosarcoma will be limited to comprise approximately 10% of the cohort 
(ie, approximately 4 pat ients). 
13.2. Planned Analysis  
The primary analysis will occur 6 months after the last patient in the cohort has started study 
treatment.  
The final analysis will occur 1 year after the last patient in the cohort has received her last dose 
of study treatment.  
Additionally, an interim safety analysis may be performed after the first 12 patients are enrolled 
between Cohorts A and B and have completed 2 cycles of ther apy. If results from 
Study 3000-01-002 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) are available and support the feasibility of the starting dose 
regimens in the current trial, the safety interim analysis will not be performed.  
13.3. Biomarker Analysis  
Exploratory endpoints of this trial include identification of potential biomarkers that would 
associate with tumor responses and evaluation of the tumor and tumor microenvironment 
changes in response to treatment. An attrition rate of up to  50% is expected  in obtaining a 
pre- and on-treatment paired samples, as it might not be safe or feasible to repeat a tumor biopsy 
in certain patients. Additionally, some of the obtained core biopsy samples may not be evaluable. 
Therefore, it is anticipated there will be approximately 20 evaluable paired specimens for this 
cohort. 
As one of the measures of tumor microenvironment change in response to treatment, presence of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) will be quantified. Based on the literature report, a 
baseline CD8+ TIL of 15 cells/field (using a ×20 objective lens)  is assumed , with a standard 
deviation of 15 cells/field.41 With 20 evaluable paired specimens, there will be 90% power to 
detect an increase in CD8+ TILs from 15 cells/field to 25 cells/fields (relative delta = 67%

a Gaussian common density function.  
The incidence/changes of biomarkers will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Correlation 
of clinical activity with biomarker subpopulations may be performed.

STUDY00000026 Page 6 of 24  1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Purpose:  
The overall objective of this project is  to determine if the intranasal administration of naloxone 
during exercise will be a novel approach to preserve the counterregulatory response to 
hypoglycemia experienced the n ext day in patients with  type 1 diabetes. Exercise induced 
autonomic failure contributes to the development of impaired awareness of  hypoglycemia. 
Treatments that blunt the consequences of exercise induced autonomic failure, such as preserving 
the post-exercise counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, may improve awa reness of 
hypoglycemia. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is an extremely promising agent. In healthy 
volunteers, intravenous administration of naloxone during  exercise preserved the 
counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia the following day (1) . In this s tudy, we will extend 
the clinical applicability by administering intranasal naloxone to individuals with type 1 diabetes. 
Specifically, we will use a randomized, placebo controlled, crossover design to administer drug or 
placebo to patients with type 1 dia betes during  acute exercise and assess the counterregulatory 
response to hypoglycemia the following day. The use of intranasal  naloxone is a highly innovative 
aspect of this proposal. Intranasal naloxone translates readily to clinical use and, as  demonstra ted 
by our preliminary data, achieves similar plasma drug concentrations as after IV administration.  
 The specific aims and the hypotheses they address are:  
Aim 1:  To assess the impact of intranasal naloxone administered during exercise on Day 1 on 
hypogl ycemia induced  symptom scores measured on Day 2.  
 Hypothesis 1:  Compared to placebo, intranasal naloxone administered on Day 1 will result in 
higher symptom  scores in response to hypoglycemia on Day 2.  
 Aim 2:  To assess the impact of intranasal naloxone ad ministered during exercise on Day 1 on 
hypoglycemia induced  epinephrine secretion on Day 2.  
 Hypothesis 2:  Compared to placebo, intranasal naloxone administered on Day 1 will result in 
higher peak  epinephrine levels in response to hypoglycemia on Day 2.  
 Secondary aims include assessment of the to lerability of the treatment and evaluation of the effect 
of the intervention on glycemic control as measured by continuous glucose monitoring for 7 days 
after each treatment. In addition, the  pharmacokinetics of intranasal naloxon e will be characterized 
and the relationship between plasma drug concentration and response will also be explored. In this 
proof of principle experiment, we will determine if the administration of  intranasal naloxone 
preserves th e counterregulatory response to subsequent hypoglycemia. If it does, future 
investigation  will focus on developing this agent for use in the real world, with experiments 
designed to identify the minimum dose  necessary to achieve the preservation, define th e duration 
of the effect, and examine the ease of usability for patients with  type 1 diabetes.  
 
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
Glycemic management and quality of life of patients with type 1 diabetes are adversely impacted by hypogl ycemia and its associated fear. Because patients with type 1 diabetes are 
unable to reduce endogenous insulin secretion and increase glucagon secretion when blood

therapy to preserve hypoglycemia counterregulation  
VERSION 8 – December 7, 2018 
STUDY00000026 Page 7 of 24  glucose falls they become critically dependent on the sympathoadrenal response to a fall in glucose to prevent profound hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, the sympathoadrenal response is 
easily blunted by everyday life experiences such as exercise, as has been shown in both healthy controls (2) and participants with type 1 diabetes (3), leading to impai red awareness 
of subsequent hypoglycemia. Up to 25% of patients with type 1 diabetes are estimated to have impaired  awareness of hypoglycemia (4, 5), which places them at great risk for severe 
hypoglycemia and potential death. Prevention of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia and reversal of the condition when it occurs requires meticulous avoidance of hypoglycemia, which is nearly impossible in this patient group that experiences one or more episo des of 
hypoglycemia each week (6 ). 
 
In particular, there is a  critical need to address impaired awareness of hypoglycemia induced 
by exercise. In exercise induced autonomic failure, the glucose level that triggers the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia on a day after exercise is lower than the value that triggers the response to hypoglycemia on a day following inactivity. Indeed, the first sign of hypoglycemia in the days following ex ercise may be neuroglycopenia (7 ). Many 
practitioners instruct patients with type 1 diabetes to reduce insulin doses in anticip ation of 
hypoglycemia during and after exercise, but such measures have not be beneficial in reducing hypoglycemia that oc curs many hours post activity (8). Therefore, innovative therapies  that 
preserve the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia experi enced post exercise are 
urgently needed.  
 
2.2 Preliminary Data:  
In healthy volunteers, intravenous administration of naloxone during  exercise preserved the 
counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia the following day (1).  
 
2.3 Existing Literature:  
Activation of opioid signaling in the brain is believed to be one mechanism that contributes to the development of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (8). Previous studies have demonstrated that intravenous administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone during exercis e prevents the 
development of exercise associated autonomic failure in humans (1).  
 Intranasal administration has long been used for therapies like glucocorticoids and has recently become available as an emergency treatment for opioid drug overdose using naloxone, the same drug we will test in this trial. Easy to use and highly portable, a intranasal delivery device that can be used during exercise to administer a drug already shown to prevent exercise induced autonomic failure would greatly expand the opti ons available to patients with type 1 diabetes who want to 
exercise without putting themselves at risk for impaired awareness of hypoglycemia in subsequent days.

5.2 Study Procedures:  
Screening Visit: At the screening visit, informed consent will be obtained; a standardized form 
will be used to insure participants meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, and baseline hemoglobin A1c will be collected. Clinical A1c from the medical record can be used if within  one month of 
screening.  
 Following the collection of blood samples, participants will have their peak aerobic capacity (VO
2peak) determined. Participants will be fitted with a neoprene breathing mask that is 
connected to an open- circuit spirometry metabo lic cart for the collection of expired gas samples. 
After a warm -up on an electronically -braked bicycle ergometer for 5 minutes, participants will 
complete a progressive resistance exercise test until volitional exhaustion. VO 2peak will be 
measured using m ethodology and equipment already established by our group (9 ). This 
measurement will then be used to determine the exercise workload necessary to achieve 60% of 
VO 2peak during the intervention phases of the study, as was done by Milman (1).  
 
-6 days Part 1 Day 1 : In preparation for the intervention vi sits, participants will be  instructed to 
avoid hypoglycemia in the w eek before day 1 since that may blunt their response to hypoglycemia 
during the  protocol. They will be asked to avoid exercise , to wear a con tinuous glucose monitor  
(provided by the study)  during the 6 days before the exercise study and the one day after , and to

STUDY00000026 Page 10 of 24  monitor and record their blood sugars before  meals, at bedtime, and any time they have symptoms 
of hypoglycemia. Participants will als o be given instructions for  diabetes management during the 
days before the study to safely ensure at home insulin has cleared the body by the start  of the 
study.  
 Participants will be instructed to call the investigators if they have symptomatic hypoglycemia with a glucose of <70 mg/dL or asymptomatic hypoglycemia with a glucose of <54 mg/dL  during 
the 6 days before the exercise studies, after discharge on day 1 or before the hypoglycemic clamp is started on day 2. Participants will be rescheduled if they h ave episodes of  hypoglycemia 
(defined as symptomatic hypoglycemia and a blood glucose or CGM reading <70 mg/dL or asymptomatic hypoglycemia with a blood glucose of < 54 mg/dL ) for more than 20 minutes in the 
days before Day 1 of the study.  
 
Part 1 Day 1:  Participants  will be instructed to report for the visit in a fasting state. Before any 
other research procedures take place, participants will be randomized to receive either naloxone or saline.  Intravenous catheters will be placed for the subsequent infusion of 1.0 mU/kg/min insulin, 
potassium phosphate  or potassium chloride (120 mEq/l at 40 cc/hr), and 20% dextrose as needed 
to maintain euglycemia. When participants reach euglycemia (~ 95 mg/dL ), they will be instructed 
to begin exercise on a stationary bicycle. Adjustments in the exercise workload will be made  to 
assure that participant s exercise at a workload requiring 60% of their VO
2peak  for 45 minutes 
based on the VO 2 measured  every 15 minutes. They will then be given a 5 minute rest break, 
followed by another 45 minute period of exercise at 60%  VO 2peak. At the start of exercise and 45 
minutes after the start of the morning exercise period, participant s will be given a 4.0 mg doses of 
intranasal naloxone or saline in the same volume, according to the randomization assignment.  
 
Participants may be asked to allow a download of their personal glucose meter/pump data.  This will be done in research offices using secure software specific for the brand of the glucose meter/pump.    At the  completion of the morning exercise, participant s will be allow ed to rest 3 hours and eat a 
15g carbohydrate measured snack. Glycemia will be maintained at euglycemia during this rest 
period.   At 1 pm, the afternoon period of exercise will start and will be maintained as in  the morning for a 
total of 2 hours. A third dose of 4.0 mg intranasal naloxone or the same volume of  saline will be 
administered at the start of the afternoon exercise, and a final dose of 4.0 mg intranasal naloxone will be given 45 minutes after  the start of the afternoon exercise. Blood samples for subsequent 
measurement of naloxone will be collected at 4 -5 predetermined time points from each participant  
to allow subsequent population pharmacokinetic modeling. After completing  the afternoon 
exercise , participant s will be sent home with instruction on avoiding hypoglycemia and using the 
CGM.  Before participants are sent home, a meal will be provided.  
 
Part 1 Day 2:  Participant s will return the following day , and undergo a two -hour hyperinsulinemic  
(infusion of 2.0 mU/kg/min) hypoglycemic  clamp in which blood glucose will be allowed to drop 
to 50 mg/dL . Symptom scores will be collected using a standardized questionnaire  before  and 
every 15 minutes during the hypoglycemic clamp study. Samples for lat er measurement of 
epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon and cortisol will be collected at baseline and every 15 
minutes during the  two-hour infusion period. After completing the clamp, participant s will be

participant s will be scheduled to return to complete part two to receive the  alternate therapy.  
 
Wash -out Period:  For a total of approximately 7 weeks, participants will be instructed to continue 
with all nor mal activities.  
 
Seven days before scheduled Part 2 Visit: Participants will be asked to come in for a visit to apply 
the CGM. Application of the sensor and instructions are as above.  
 
Part 2 Day 1 and Part 2 Day 2: The second part of the study will foll ow exactly as above with the 
exception that the participant will receive the alternate therapy to complete the cross -over. Those 
who received naloxone in Part 1 will receive saline in Part 2, and vice versa.  
 A mid -point A1C may be collected at this visit. A clinical A1C from the medical record can be 
used if within three months of the Screening A1C.   
5.3 Follow -Up:  
Participants will be contacted at 1 week post final study procedure for adverse event assessment. This can be done by either telephone or e mail.

therapy to preserve hypoglycemia counterregulation  
VERSION 8 – December 7, 2018 
STUDY00000026 Page 16 of 24  Participants in previous studies , who have given permission to be  contact , will be  called/emailed 
about the study and asked to consider enrollment. Only participants who have given permission for a direct telephone call will be called, all others will have the letter sent through the post office or electronic mail.   
12.2 Source of Participants:  
Participants could come from a variety of sources including self -selection from the public 
population at clinics where flyers have been posted and from medical record review of the patient population.   
12.3 Identification of Potential Participants:  
Participants could self -identify in response to recr uitment advertisements and contact the research 
staff; at that point, research staff will verbally confirm basic eligibility and schedule a screening visit.  
Research staff will also identify potential participants by reviewing medical records of affiliate d 
study endocrinologists. Working with clinic staff, research clinicians will speak with their patients or a letter will be sent to explain the study and provide coordinator contact information. Study health care professionals will also speak to patients i f, during the course of a standard -of-care visit, 
it becomes evident that they might be eligible and/or interested in research.  Opt -out status will be 
reviewed prior to patient contact.  
 
12.4 Recruitment Materials:  
Recruitment materials, as submitted to and a pproved by the IRB include the following:  
• Phone script  
• Email or letter for former participants matching eligibility  
• Letter from affiliated endocrinologist

VERSION 8 – December 7, 2018 
STUDY00000026 Page 17 of 24  Compensation will be paid at the completion of each study visit. Compensation will be in the form 
of a check -request through the University of Minnesota  which will be mailed to the participant’s 
house or the Greenphire ClinCard debit card system.  
  
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  
Participants will be withdrawn without their consent if at any point following enrollment they develop any of the exclusion criteria.  
 
13.2 Withdrawal Procedures:  
No additional data will be collected from a participant who withdraws from the study. Because 
this is a paired study, withdrawn participants will be replaced with a new participant. Participants recruited to replace a withdrawn participant will be newly randomized and will not be a direct one -
to-one replacement following the same treatment sequence.  
 
13.3 Termination Procedures:  
Any data collected on early -terminators will still be used, up to the point at which they formally 
withdrew consent. Baseline data from both completers and non- completers will be used to 
understand intervention effect and to better design future studies.  
 
14.0 Risks to Participants  
14.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
Naloxone risks:  Potential risks include increased blood pressure, musculoskeletal pain, heada che, 
nasal dryness, nasal edema, nasal congestion, and nasal inflammation. Precipitated withdrawal can occur in those using opioids in the previous 24 hours. Participants will be questioned about opioid use before naloxone/placebo administration.  
Bike Ride risks:  Discomfort might be felt in body and mind from doing vigorous exercise.  There 
is also risk of injury during exercise testing.  These risks are rare and range from minor injuries such as a pulled muscle or sprained ankle to severe injuries such as a heart attack or even sudden 
death. The exercise test personnel will be monitoring participants  every minute of the test to 
minimize these risks . A study physician or physician’s assistant and a study nurse will also be in 
the room monitoring the subj ect during the exercise study and prepared to stop the study and 
administer care should a medical problem develop.   
Hypoglycemia risks: Sweating, shakiness, confusion, and feeling “low”. Glucose levels will be 
monitored throughout Part 1 and Part 2 both days and the study will be stopped if participant’s levels cannot be monitored due to technical malfunction or study MD/PA feels that it is no longer safe for the participant to continue. Glucose will be immediately be given to normalize the participant’s levels.  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Hypoglycemia after exercise in type 1 diabetes: Intranasal naloxone as a novel 
therapy to preserve hypoglycemia counterregulation  
VERSION 8 – December 7, 2018 
STUDY00000026 Page 18 of 24  Blood draw risks:  The risks associated with the blood draw include minimal discomfort, and/or 
bruising.  Fainting is possible but unlikely.  In very rare cases, a small blood clot can form at the site of the needle insertion. The main inconvenience  is the time it will require for the blood to be 
drawn. The risks of the intravenous line are similar to a blood draw  but because it is kept in the 
vein for a longer period of time (8 hours for Day 1, 4 hours for Day 2), the risk of bruising and discomfort  are slightly higher. There w ill be two intravenous lines placed, one in each arm.  
General participation risks : There is always the risk for a breach of confidentiality during the 
course of any research study.  
 
14.2 Reproduction Risks:  
Naloxone is a Schedule C drug, thus its use is not recommended in pregnant women. Animal 
studies have shown no adverse effect on the fetus but there are no adequate and well- controlled 
studies in humans so the effect on the human effect is currently unknown. It is also not known if 
naloxone is excreted in breast milk. Currently pregnant women nor those who are planning on becoming pregnant while enrolled will be excluded.  
 
14.3 Risks to Others:  
Not applicable.  
 
15.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
15.1 Potential Benefits:  
The only direct benefit to individual participants is a possible better awareness of hypoglycemia symptoms.   
16.0 Data Management  
16.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
All randomized subjects who have complete outcome data for one or both of parts 1 and 2 will b e 
included in t he analysis. The Aim 1 primary outcome is difference in symptom scores collected 
during hypoglycemia on day 2 following the intranasal naloxone vs intranasal sal ine intervention 
on day one. The Aim 2 primary  outcome will be the  peak epinephrine during the hypoglycemic 
clamp on day 2 of each part, thus each participant will have two observations:  one from their 
naloxone experiment and one from their saline experiment. The statistician will fit a  general linear 
mixed model with  fixed effects for treatment (Naloxone vs. saline), treatment order (Naloxone 
first vs. saline first), and period (Part 1 vs. Part  2) and a random effect for participant. The level of 
significance will be set at p< 0.05.  
The study has been confidently designed, with a washout period of 7+ weeks between Parts 1 and 
2, to ensure minimization of  the possibility of a treatment effect from Part 1 that lingers into Part 
2. Summary statistics will be used to examine whether measures of metabolic conditions showed clinically meaningful differences between naltrexone studies and saline studies. If there are, then  
the treatment comparison will be repeated using the same linear mixed model but with additional 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Hypoglycemia after exercise in type 1 diabetes: Intranasal naloxone as a novel 
therapy to preserve hypoglycemia counterregulation  
VERSION 8 – December 7, 2018 
STUDY00000026 Page 19 of 24  adjustment for the  metabolic parameters of concern; t his will be done separately for epinep hrine 
and symptoms scores.  
Secondary  outcomes will be analyzed similarly, using models appropriate for the scale of the 
outcome (e.g., linear models, logistic models, binomial models).  
Data analysis will  also consider adjustment for important baseline ch aracteristics,  such as age and 
sex. Diagnostics will be examined to assess model assumptions. Baseline characteristics of those 
who do complete vs. those who do not complete both parts will be  examined and used to inform  
interpretation of the  treatment eff ect.  
 
16.2 Power Analysis:  
The primary outcome variable for Aim 1 will be the difference, naloxone vs. saline,  in 
symptom scores collected using a standard questionnaire during the hypoglycemic clamp on Day 2, after administration of intranasal treatment during exercise on Day 1. The primary outcome variable for Aim 2 will be the difference, naloxone vs. saline, i n peak epinephrine 
levels measured during the hypoglycemic clamp on Day 2, after administration of treatment during exercise on Day 1. In a previous study done with naltrexone (an opioid antagonist that can be given orally) ,  the standard deviation of the differences in symptoms scores collected 
during hypoglycemia after participants were treated with drug vs. sal ine was 12.9 points (12). 
In the  preliminary study with naloxone, symptom scores  were found to be about 50% greater 
during hypoglycemia done on Da y 2 following administration of intranasal naloxone vs. 
saline during hypoglycemia on Day 1 (with numerical differences ranging from 7 to 21). Based on these data, it is calculated  that the necessary sample size of 25 completers to have 
80% power to detect  a difference of 7.53 points in symptom scores between those treated 
with intranasal naloxone vs. saline during exercise on day 1 with p < 0.05. Analysis of the data published in Milman et al (1) , suggests that at least 15 subjects must complete the study 
for the power to detect a mean  paired difference in hypoglycemia induced epinephrine 
secretion on Day 1 between those treated with intranasal naloxone vs. saline during exercise on day 1. Therefore, the plan is to enroll 30 subjects to ensure that we compl ete studies in the  
28 subjects we need to address the first aim.  
 
16.3 Data Integrity:  
The PI will periodically review data for completeness and to ensure that all procedures are being followed as detailed in the protocol. The assigned Regulatory Specialist wil l also perform periodic 
quality assurance monitoring at any point requested by the PI.  
 
17.0 Confidentiality

secure location on  campus and are backed up nightly, with the backups stored in accordance with 
the AHC -IS retenti on schedule of daily, weekly, and monthly tapes retained for 1 month, 3 
months, and 6 months, respectively. Weekly backup tapes are stored offsite. The AHC -IS servers 
provide a stable, secure, well -maintained, and high- capacity data storage environment, and both 
REDCap and MySQL are widely used, powerful, reliable, well -supported systems. Access to the 
study's data in REDCap will be restricted to the members of the study team by username and 
password.  
 Consent documents will not be placed in the participant’s medical record. Documentation of research involvement will not be recorded in the medical record.  
 
18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of Participants  
18.1 Data Integrity Monitoring.  
While there will be no planned interim data analysis, the PI will periodically review data for 
completeness and to ensure that all procedures are being followed as detailed in the protocol. The assigned Regulatory Specialist or CTSI monitor will also perform periodic quality assurance 
monitoring at any point requested by the PI or at least annually.  
 
18.2 Data Safety Monitoring.  
An unblinded Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be assembled, including the following individuals:  
• Independent monitor: endocrinologist with clinical and research experience.  
o Brandon Nathan, MD. Associate Professor. Division of Pediatric Endocrinology. Department of Pediatrics,  University of Minnesota  
• Independent monitor: endocrinologist with clinical and research experience. 
o Melena Bellin, MD. Associate Professor of Pediatric Endocrinology Department of Surgery , University of Minnesota

 The Principal Investigator will oversee the safety of the study, including careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events. All adverse  and serious adverse events will be 
discussed with the PI within 48 hours for standard assessments (causality, expectedness, severity, and seriousness). IRB and other regulatory reporting requirements will be reviewed by study staff and followed with assis tance of the Regulatory Specialist assigned to the study.  
 Specific safety data to be monitored includes those associated with naloxone administration and hypoglycemia. Participant s will be continuously monitored during the administration of 
the naloxone/ placebo by study personnel.
 At each study visit following consent , participants 
will be asked about their health since the last time they were seen by the study staff . 
• Those specifically related to naloxone: muscoskeletal pain, headache, nasal symptoms, blood pressure, and other cardiac events.  
•
 Glucose levels: if at any point during Part 1 or Part 2, glucose monitoring becomes impossible because of technical failure or other issue or if the MD/PA present suspects an immediate concern, the study will be imm ediately halted and blood sugar given to 
participant.  
 
19.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants  
19.1 Protecting Privacy:  
Participants will sign a consent form and a HIPAA Authorization which will detail what data and under what circumstances will be shared with research staff and non -research staff.  
 It is not anticipated that any survey will ask intrusive or difficult ques tions. However, surveys will 
be explained in full detail in the consent so that participants can make informed decisions before they enroll. The consent will also detail under which conditions any information may be shared with those outside of the interna l research staff.  
 
19.2 Access to Participants:  
Participants will sign a consent and HIPAA authorization.  
 
20.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury

24.1 Resources Available:  
Approximately 30 participants are expected to consent to the study to ensure 25 matched- pairs 
completing the study. Over the assumed two and a half years needed for recruitment, this is about 2-3 participants per month. Previous, similar studies have been able to recruit this number and the 
enrollment rate is expected to be similar given the patient population of Diabetes and Endocrinology clinics at M Health where most recruitment flyers will be posted.   
 
Study visits will be completed at the Clinical Res earch Unit or Delaware Clinical Research Unit as 
contracted with CTSI, the Clinic and Surgery Center (CSC), or research space within the Phillips -
Wangensteen Building. Staff has private offices for non- participant research activities, primarily 
located in the Phillips -Wangensteen Building.  
 Participants will be referred to an endocrinologist or their personal physician for any medical or psychological evaluation that may be required as a result of the research.

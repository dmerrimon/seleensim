1.2 Study  Description  
This is a prospective, multi -center, randomized, parallel group, control led, assessor and 
subject masked study. Both eyes of a subject must require cataract surgery to qualify for 
enrollment into this study. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
model DFT015 (test article) or model SN60WF (control  article) in both eyes. To further 
reduce bias, all subjects and site assessors will be masked to subject treatment assignment 
until the end of the study.  
 
The first operative eye is defined as the eye with the worse BCDVA. If the BCDVA is the 
same in both  eyes, identify the right eye (OD) as the first operative eye. The second eye 
implant must occur within 14 days of the 1st eye implant.  
An overview of the study design is depicted in Figure 1 -1.

 The schedule of visits is included as Table 9 -1 in the appendix.  
 
The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of ACRYSOF IQ EDF 
IOL at Month 6/Visit 4A. After all subjects complete Month 6/Visit 4A, the study database 
will be locked to conduct planned analyses. Results from these analyses will be used in a 
clinical study report for submission.  
 
Figure  1-1 Study Design Diagram  
 
 
A total of 9 scheduled visits are planned and subject participation is ex pected to last 7 -8 
months. The visits include a Screening visit (Visit 0), two Operative Visits (Visit 00 and Visit 
00A), and 6 postoperative visits at the following intervals: Day 1 -2 (Visit 1/1A), Day 7 -14 
(Visit2/2A), Day 30 -60 (Visit 3A), and Day 120 -180 (Visit 4A). See Figure 9 -1 Study 
Design. Primary endpoint data will be collected at the Month 6/ Visit 4A (120 -180 day post 
2nd eye implantation).  
Note: Visit 4A may be completed over 2 days within a 2 week period. Both days must fall 
within the specified visit window.

 1.3 Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL or 
ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal IOL. Ra ndomization will be stratified by site. Only after signing 
the informed consent form (ICF), a subject will be assigned a subject number by the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system. The Investigator (or delegate) at Operative Visit / Visit 
00 will initiate randomization in EDC after confirming the subject is eligible for 
randomization. Randomization must be completed no more than two business days prior to 
the first eye operative visit (Visit 00), and post lens power calculation and IOL power 
selection of bo th test and control IOLs, unless there is a valid reason to randomize earlier.  
After randomization is initiated, all eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two 
treatment arms.  
 
1.4 Masking  
The assessor and subject will be masked in this study. Subjects will be masked to their 
treatment assignment for the entire duration of the study.  
 
Site personnel performing the manifest refraction, all VA assessments (including defocus 
curve testing) and all contrast sensitivity assessments will remain masked with regard to 
treatment assignment until after the final database lock. Alcon and site personnel will not 
reveal the treatment assignment to study subjects at any time during the study. Should a 
subject safety concern arise, refer to Section 13.10 of the protocol (Unmasking of the Study 
Treatment).  
 
1.5 Interim  Analysis  
Not Applicable.  
 
2 Analysis  Sets 
2.1 Efficacy Analysis  Sets 
The all -implanted analysis set (AAS) includes all randomized eyes with successful I OL 
implantation.  
 
The best -case analysis set (BAS). BAS includes all eyes successfully implanted that had:  
 
• at least 1 postoperative visit ; 
• no preoperative ocular pathology  
• no macular degeneration detected at any  time

Page 10 Printed By:  Print Date:   
 • no previous surgery for the correction of refractive  errors  
• no major protocol violation  
The primary analysis set for effectiveness analyses will be the AAS. Additional supportive 
analyses will be performed using the BAS.  
 
All effectiveness analyses will be conducted according to actual test or control article 
implanted.  
 
2.2 Safety Analysis  Set 
The Safety Analysis Set will include all eyes with attempted IOL implantation (successful or 
aborted after contact with the eye).  
 
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for analysis of safety endpoints.  
 
Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis set on a treatment -emergent basis. 
For treatment -emergent safety analyses, eyes will be categorized under the actual test or 
control article implanted (or attempted to implant).  
 
2.3 Pharmacokinetic A nalysis  Set 
Not Applicable.  
 
3 Subject Characteristics and Study Conduct  Summaries  
Subject characteristics and study conduct summaries include tables and listings such as a 
subject disposition table, demographics and baseline characteristics tables (includin g age, 
gender, race, ethnicity), listing of treatment assignments by site, summary of screen failures 
by reason and listing of subjects excluded from key analysis sets including reasons. All 
descriptive summary statistics will be displayed with n and % for  categorical data, and with 
mean, median, standard deviation, number of subjects, minimum and maximum for 
continuous data. Tables will be presented by treatment and overall.  
 
Subject characteristics and study conduct summaries will be presented for the AAS  and the 
safety analysis set. Subject characteristics and study conduct summaries for the best -case 
analysis set will be presented if the number of subjects excluded exceeds 10%.  
 
4 Effectiveness Analysis  Strategy  
A success on co -primary effectiveness endpoi nts would be indicated by successful outcomes 
on all 4 of these endpoints (2 hypothesis tests and 2 performance targets). A total of four

 hypothesis tests will be conducted to address the primary and secondary objectives of the 
study. Overall Type I error will be maintained at the 0.05 level using a sequential testing 
approach described in Section 4.4. 
 
Hypothe sis tests on secondary effectiveness endpoints will be conducted only after successful 
outcomes on all 4 co -primary effectiveness endpoints are demonstrated.  
 
Analyses on performance targets are based on point estimates.  
 
Only the first eye of each subject  will be included in the primary statistical analysis (as 
described in IS EN ISO 11979 -7:2014).

monocular photopic distance corrected intermediate visual acuity (66 cm from spectacle 
plane) at Visit 4A (120 -180d postoperative)  
The null and alternative hypotheses for the first co -primary analysis are:  
H0: µDFT015VA  µSN60WFVA

H0: µDFT015VA  µSN60WFVA 
HA: µDFT015VA < µ SN60WFVA  
where µ DFT015VA  and µ SN60WFVA  refer to the mean monocular photopic DCNVA at  
40 cm for the test and control lenses, respectively, i n the first implanted eye. Second 
implanted eye analysis will be supportive.

The statistical hypothesis in support of the second secondary effectiveness objective is:  
 
ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL is superior to ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal IOL with respect to 
proportion of subjects who respond “Never” to Q1 of the IOLSAT questionnaire (Overall, in 
the past 7 days, how often did you need to wear eyeglasses to see?) at Visit 4A (120 -180d 
postoperative).  
The null and alternative hypotheses for the second secondary analysis are:  
H0: πDFT015Q1  πSN60WFQ1 
HA: πDFT015Q1 > π SN60WFQ1  
where πDFT015Q1 and πSN60WFQ1 refer to the proportion of subjects who responded 
“Never” for the test and control lenses.

Poolability of primary outcomes across sites will be assessed using a fixed effects model 
including main effects of treatment and site along with a treatment by site interaction effect. 
Subjects across sites will be con sidered poolable if the interaction effect is not significant at 
type I error of 0.15. If the interaction effect is significant, a mixed effects model will be used 
to estimate treatment effect. The following mixed effect models will be used and compared 
using Bayesian information criterion (BIC).  
 
1. A fixed effect for treatment and random effects for site and site by  treatment 
interaction  
 
2. A fixed effect for treatment and random effect for  site 
 
The model with smaller BIC will be selected as the final model to estimate treatment effect 
(Littell 2006). The SAS pseudocode for each of the above models are provided below.  
 
Fixed effects model for assessing poolability:

 ISO requires that only the first eye of each subject is included in the primary analysis - 
Section 6.6 of ISO 11979 -7:2014. An analysis with a mixed -effect model analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) accounting for correlation between the first and the second eye w ill be performed 
as a sensitivity analyses. The following SAS pseudocode will be used:

4.3.1.2  Monocular Best Corrected Distance Visual  Acuity  
Analysis of the second primary effectiveness endpoint (BCDVA) will be based on a two - 
sample t -test, with a type I error rate of 5%, 1 -sided. The difference in means (ACRYSOF IQ  
EDF IOL minus ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal IOL) and the associated one -sided 95% upper 
confidence limit will be presented.  
 
Data poolability will be analyzed by testing a treatment by site interaction effect as described 
in 4.3.1.1 . A sensitivity analysis with a mixed -effect model analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
accounting for correlation between the first and the second eye will be performed as a 
sensitivity analyses as described in 4.3.1.1 . 
 
4.3.1.3  Mon ocular Depth of  Focus  
For the first performance target (depth of focus), the line plot of the average visual acuity at 
each defocus level (ie, defocus curve) will be used to estimate the negative lens induced 
depth of focus at 0.2 logMAR. The depth of focus will be estimated as  the dioptric range 
between zero defocus and the first point on the negative lens induced defocus curve that 
crosses the 0.2 logMAR using a linear interpolation. The difference in the depth of focus 
between ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL and ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal IOL w ill be presented.  
 
If the defocus value for the ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL is at least 0.50 D greater than the value 
for the ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal IOL at 0.20 logMAR for the first implanted eye, then the 
performance target will be met.  
 
The following sensitivity an alyses will be performed on the depth of focus endpoint:  
 
Exclude extreme outliers (individual depth of focus values less than Q1 – 3*IQR or greater 
than Q3 + 3*IQR)

 Exclude mild outliers (individual depth of focus values less than Q1 – 1.5*I QR or greater 
than Q3 + 1.5*IQR), where Q1 = 25th percentile, Q3= 75th percentile, and IQR = Q3 – Q1. 
The depth of focus data (including defocus curves) will be presented by IOL group, 3 
photopic pupil size ranges [ 3.0 mm (small), 3.0 mm to 4.0 mm (medi um), and 4.0 mm 
(large)] and three axial length ranges [ 21.0 mm (short), 21.0 mm to 26.0 mm (medium), 
and 26.0 mm (long)]. Descriptive summary statistics (number of eyes, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) on individual depth of f ocus value will be 
presented by IOL group.  
 
4.3.1.4  Monocular Distance Corrected Intermediate Visual  Acuity 
of 0.2 logMAR or Better at 66  centimeters  
For the second performance target (DCIVA), the percentage of eyes achieving distance 
corrected intermediate visual  acuity of 0.2 logMAR or better in each IOL group will  be 
presented and compared against the performance target of  50%.  
 
4.3.2 Secondary Effectiveness  Analyses  
A success on the first secondary effectiveness endpoint will be indicated by successful 
outcomes  on the hypothesis  test and two performance  targets.  A hypothesis  test on the second 
secondary effectiveness endpoint will be conducted only after successful outcomes on the 
first secondary endpoint are  demonstrated.  
 
4.3.2.1  Monocular Distance Corrected Near Visual Acuity at  40 
centimeters  
Analysis of first secondary effectiveness endpoint  (DCNVA) will be based on a two -sample t - 
test, with a type I error rate of 2.5%, 1 -sided. The difference in means (ACRYSOF IQ EDF 
IOL minus ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal IOL) and the associated two -sided 95% confidence 
interval will be presented.  
 
Two performance targets in support of the first secondary effectiveness objective are:  
 
At least 50% of eyes with ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL achieve a monocular DCNVA of 0.3 
logMAR or better  
The percentage of eyes achieving monocular DCNVA of 0.3 logMAR or better in ACRYSOF 
IQ ED F IOL group is at least 25 percentage points higher than in ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal 
IOL group.

of 25%.  
 
4.3.2.2  Proportion of Subjects Who Respond “Never” to Q1 of  the 
IOLSAT  Questionnaire  
A two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions (ACRYSOF IQ EDF 
IOL – ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal IOL) will be calculated using the Miettinen -Nurminen 
method (1985), and ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL will be determined to be superior to ACRYSOF 
IQ Mono focal IOL if the lower boundary of the confidence interval is greater than zero. This 
is equivalent to using a type I error rate of 2.5%, 1 -sided.  
 
The following SAS pseudocode will be used to estimate the difference in proportions and the 
corresponding tw o-sided 95% confidence interval.

If IOLSAT questionnaire generates scores, the cumulative dis tribution curves showing the 
percentage of subjects with a given change in their score compared to baseline by IOL group 
will be presented to help determine whether any observed differences are meaningful.  
 
In addition, the frequencies of responses to each  item in IOLSAT will be summarized by IOL 
group and visit with counts and percentages.

 endpoints will be conducted to assess the consistency of treatment effect across various 
subgroups if appropriate.  
 
The consistency of the treatment effect for the first t wo co -primary and the first secondary 
visual acuity endpoints will be assessed for first eye and second eye using descriptive 
statistics by category of the following subgroup factors:  
 
• Age category (<65 vs. ≥65  years)  
• Investigative  site 
• Adverse event (study eyes with ocular adverse events vs. study eyes without ocular 
adverse events)  and 
• Preoperative ocular pathology (study eyes with vs. study eyes  without)  
Descriptive statistics provided will be sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, number 
of eyes, minimum, maximum, and the confidence interval. Listings of monocular DCIVA 
(66cm), monocular BCDVA (4 m) and monocular DCNVA (40 cm) at every visit for e ach eye 
will also be provided.  
 
These subgroup analyses will be performed for the AAS.  
 
 
 
4.6 Handling of Missing  Data  
The AAS and BAS do not include any imputed values. Although the influence of missing 
data is expected to be minimal, the following sensitivit y analyses will be conducted to assess 
the impact of missing data on the conclusions for the first two co -primary effectiveness 
endpoints and first secondary effectiveness endpoint. Examples are shown for DCIVA.  
 
1. Multiple imputation (with a fully condition al specification) method will be used to 
impute and estimate the treatment  effect.  
 
2. The sensitivity of inferences to departures from the MAR assumption will be 
examined using a pattern -mixture model approach (with a control -based pattern 
imputation). (Rati tch 2011)

 A fully conditional specification (FCS) method will be used to impute missing values at all 
visits in a data set with an arbitrary missing pattern. The FCS method uses a separate 
conditional distribution for each imputed variable.  
 
The following SAS pseudo code with the PROC MI procedure will be used to impute missing 
values using FCS method:

 • Subjectiv e posterior capsular opacification (PCO)  assessment  
• Posterior capsulotomy  
• Intraoperative surgical  problems  
• Other procedures at surgery (combined and/or  additional)  
• Device  deficiencies  
5.2 Safety  Hypotheses  
Cumulative and persistent AEs listed in IS EN ISO 11979 -7:2014 will be compared with the 
historical control SPE rates. The focus of the safety analysis will be a comprehensive 
descriptive assessment of safety endpoints listed in Section 5.1.  
 
5.3 Statistical M ethods for Safety  Analyses  
Except otherwise stated, the analysis set for all safety analyses is the safety analysis set as 
defined in Section 2.2. Baseline will be defined as the last measurement prior to exposure to 
investiga tional product, except otherwise stated.  
 
5.3.1 Primary Safety  Analyses  
5.3.1.1  Adverse  Events  
All information obtained on adverse events (AEs) will be displayed by treatment and subject.  
 
The number and percentage of all ocular adverse events, including secondary surgi cal 
interventions (SSIs) for either eye, will be tabulated by preferred term with a breakdown by 
treatment, separately for first and second eyes. An eye with multiple ocular AEs of the same 
preferred term is only counted once toward the total of this prefe rred term.  
 
The number and percentage of all adverse events will also be tabulated with a breakdown by 
treatment, separately for first and second implanted eyes.  
 
Adverse events will be summarized in the following tables:  
 
1. All Adverse Events (Serious and Non -Serious  Combined)  
a. Ocular  
b. Nonocular  
2. All Adverse Device  Effects  
a. Ocular  
b. Nonocular

In addition, descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for specific AEs will be 
presented by IOL group. The one -sided exact 95% lower confidence limit of incidence rates 
(proportion of eyes with events) observed for each IOL group w ill be compared to the 
cumulative and persistent adverse event safety and performance endpoint (SPE) rates. In 
addition to SPE rates predefined in IS EN ISO 11979 -7, the rate of adverse events that may 
be specifically related to ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL design f eatures; and any other significant 
events will be provided. These rates will be accompanied by two -sided exact 95% confidence 
intervals.

The number and percentage of secondary surgical interventions will be presented with a 
breakdown by IOL group and implanted eye. In addition, the number and percentage of 
secondary IOL interventions will be presented with a breakdown by IOL group and impla nted 
eye in each of the following categories:  
1) Related to IOL - due to optical  properties  
2) Related to IOL - not due to optical  properties  
A listing of secondary IOL interventions and secondary surgical interventions unrelated to 
IOL will also be presented, respectively.  
5.3.1.2  Mesopic Contrast Sensitivity (With and Without  Glare)  
Contrast sensitivity testing is conducted at 1.5, 3.0, 6.0 and 12.0 C PD for mesopic testing. At 
each CPD, the presentations consist of a sample grating (represented as ‘S’ in Table 5 –2) 
followed by 8 gratings of decreasing contrast levels for testing (represented by numbers 1 to 
8 in Table 5 –2). A subject’s performance at each CPD is either an ‘S’, if only the sample 
grating is identified, or numbers 1 to 8 (with 8 corresponding to the lowest level of contrast 
that can be identified). Scores of ‘S’ are recorded as  0 in the scoring form. If a subject is 
unable to identify the sample grating at a particular CPD, the data for that CPD is considered 
missing and will be recorded as a -1 in the scoring form.  
 
The following table presents the manufacturer’s recommended lo g contrast sensitivity norms 
corresponding to the recorded scores of -1, 0, or 1 -8.

Analyses of log contrast sensitivity w ill be performed for each testing condition and spatial 
frequency. Prior to averaging or any other statistical calculations, contrast threshold values 
corresponding to 0 - 8 will be converted to log contrast sensitivity values using Table 5 –2.

 Subjects who score a ( -1) i.e. are unable to see a targeted spatial frequency at any available 
contrast, including that of the reference patch, are assigned the lowest measurable value 
(corresponding to score of 0 in Table 5–2). The resulting mean will be preceded by the 
appropriate inequality symbol (<) to indicate that the actual contrast sensitivity is less than 
the calculated value. Similarly, the resulting standard deviations and any other variability 
statistics calculate d from the data sets containing unmeasurable values ( -1) will be preceded 
by the appropriate inequality symbol (>). The number and percentage of subjects who cannot 
see any contrast (i.e. scores of -1) will be recorded and tabulated for each spatial freque ncy to 
provide a qualitative extent of the bias. Descriptive statistics will include number of eyes, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and additional percentiles (10th, 
25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles). Descriptive tables will include a note that the  corresponding 
mean values are biased upward and variability values are biased downward (using < and > 
symbols).  
 
The 5th percentile of log contrast sensitivity values will be calculated for the control group, 
then the percentage of eyes in th e test group that achieved a log contrast sensitivity lower 
than this value will be  presented.  
 
In addition,  for mesopic  contrast  sensitivity,  descriptive  summary  statistics  will be presented 
by IOL group and 3 mesopic pupil size ranges: [ 3.0 mm (small), 3.0 mm to 4.0 mm 
(medium), and 4.0 mm  (large)].  
5.3.2 Secondary Safety  Analyses  
5.3.2.1  Visual Disturbances Using the QUVID  Questionnaire  
For the secondary safety endpoint, descriptive summarie s (counts and percentages) for the 
severe and most bothersome (separately) visual disturbances as reported by the subjects using 
the QUVID questionnaire will be presented by IOL group and visit. These rates will be 
accompanied by two -sided exact 95% confid ence intervals.  
 
If QUVID questionnaire generates scores, the cumulative distribution curves showing the 
percentage of subjects with a given change in their score compared to baseline by IOL group 
will be presented to help determine whether any observed di fferences are meaningful.  
 
Counts and percentages of subjects who did not have a given visual disturbance at baseline 
but developed and present at Visit 4A (120 -180d postoperative) will be presented.

6 Sample Size and Power  Calculations  
Approximately 220 subjects will be randomized to achieve 200 subjects who complete the 
study.  
 
Effectiveness  
 
The proposed sample size (N = 200; 100 for each IOL group) provides >99% power for the 
superiority hypothesis test on mean monocular photopic dist ance corrected intermediate 
visual acuity (66 cm) when tested at the 0.025 level of significance (one -sided). This 
assessment assumes:  
 
Difference in DCIVA (66 cm) [logMAR]: Mean (SD) = -0.12 (0.18)  
The proposed sample size will provide 84% power for the n on-inferiority hypothesis with 
respect to mean photopic monocular best corrected distance visual acuity when tested at the  
0.05 level of significance (one -sided) with a non -inferiority margin of 0.1 logMAR assuming:  
 
Difference in BCDVA [logMAR]: Mean (SD) = 0.04 (0.16)  
The proposed sample size provides >99% power for the superiority hypothesis test on mean 
photopic monocular distance corrected near visual acuity (40 cm) when tested at the 0.025 
level of significance (one -sided). This assessment assumes:  
Difference in DCN VA (40 cm) [logMAR]: Mean (SD) = -0.12 (0.18)  
The proposed sample size will provide 94% power, with α=0.025, 1 -sided, to detect a 
difference of 25% in proportion of subjects who respond “Never” to Q1 of the IOLSAT 
questionnaire (Overall, in the past 7 days , how often did you need to wear eyeglasses to 
see?), assuming a 50% rate in the ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL group.

 For any event where zero incidence is observed in 100 operative eyes with AcrySof® IQ 
EDF IOL, the one -sided exact 95% upper confidence limit is less than 3%. Thus, with 
95% confidence the true adverse event rate is less than 3%.

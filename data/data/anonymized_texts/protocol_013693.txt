Protocol Synopsis  
 
Title A Biomarker- Based  Pilot  Study  of Mouse  Subcutaneous  
Immunotherapy  in Mouse  Sensitive  Adults  with Asthma  
Short  Title Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  in Adults  (SCITMO) 
Clinical  Phase I/IIa 
Number  of Sites Multiple 
Study  Objectives  The primary objective  of the study is  to assess  if treatment with  
mouse  SCIT,  using the  per protocol  allergenic  extract doses, is safe.  
This will be done  by determining the  rate of related  adverse  events  
and serious  adverse  events  in the  course  of treatment.  
Secondary objectives  are: 
1. To determine  whether  a 24 week  treatment with  mouse  
SCIT,  using the  per protocol  allergenic  extract  doses,  will 
induce  a 3-fold increase  in mouse -specific  serum  IgE. 
2. To determine  whether  a 24 week  treatment  with  mouse  
SCIT,  using the  per protocol  allergenic  extract  doses,  will 
induce  changes  in the serum  levels  of mouse -specific  IgG 
and IgG4.  
3. To determine  whether  a 24 week  treatment  with  mouse  
SCIT,  using the  per protocol  allergenic  extract  doses, will 
inhibit  the in the  in-vitro mouse  antigen binding to B-cells. 
Study  Design This is an open label  trial of mouse  allergenic  extract  administered  
by subcutaneous  injection in 10 adults  ages  18 to 55 years  with  
asthma  and mouse  sensitivity.  It is designed  to study the  safety of 
this therapy as  well as biomarkers  of the immune  response. 
Primary Endpoint(s)  The number  of reported  adverse  events  and serious  adverse  
events,  including their  severity,  seriousness,  and treatment 
relatedness.  
Secondary Endpoint(s)  1. Changes  in levels  of mouse  specific  IgE observed after  
initiation  of study  treatment.  
2. Changes  in mouse specific  IgG and IgG4.  
3. Change  in in -vitro mouse  antigen binding to B-cells 
Accrual  Objective Approximately  10 - 12 
Study  Duration 12 months

1 Background and Rationale  
1.1 Background and Scientific  Rationale  
Mouse  allergen has  received much  less attention than  cockroach  allergen,  despite  the fact that findings  to date  suggest  
that exposure  to this pest  allergen also plays  an important  role in asthma  morbidit y.1-4 Like Bla g 1, the major        
mouse  allergen,  Mus  m 1, is detectable  in a very high proportion  of inner -city homes  and is  present  in 100- fold higher  
concentrations in inner -city homes  compared to  suburban homes .5,6 Mouse  allergen  exposure  is also a well-recognized  
risk factor  for occupational  asthma,  with  30-50%  of laboratory mouse  workers  experiencing  mouse -related  allergic  
symptoms,  and 20%  with skin test  sensitivity  to mouse.7   More  compelling  with regard to  inner -city asthma  is the fact 
that Mus  m 1 levels  in many  inner -city homes  are comparable  to levels  found in  occupational  settings,  where  mouse  
allergen is  known  to cause  both  acute  and chronic  asthma.   In addition,  the prevalence  rate of mouse  skin test  
sensitivity  in patients  with  asthma  living in the inner -city is similar  to that found in occupational  settings.   In fact,  cross - 
sectional studies  of inner -city asthmatics have  found  mouse  skin test sensitization rates  of 17-50% .2,8-10 The fact that 
both  the prevalence  of mouse  sensitization and  the intensity of Mus  m 1 exposure  in the  inner -city are similar  to that 
observed in  occupational  settings  – where  mouse  allergen  is a known cause  of asthma  symptoms – provides  a 
compelling rationale  for a causal link between mouse  allergen exposure  and asthma  in the  inner -city. 
 
As with cockroach allergen,  the only currently available  treatment for mouse  allergy  is avoidance  and eradication. 
Studies  aimed at  the eradication  of mice  in home  environments  have  had some  success;  however,  the fact remains  
that multifaceted  environmental  eradication programs  are extremely  difficult  to implement  in inner  city environments  
with limited resources.   As such,  a more  definitive  treatment  may  be desensitization of patients  with  mouse  allergy  
using allergen immunotherapy.  
Given  these  data,  a major ICAC  goal is to conduct  a large  multi -center  efficacy trial  of immunotherapy,  including   
mouse  allergen,  in inner -city asthma.  While  we have  pursued the  possibility of using sublingual  immunotherapy  (SLIT)  
given its  excellent  safety  profile,  data  from the  BioCSI  and BioCSI2 studies  (ICAC -12 and ICAC -17) of cockroach SLIT   
have  raised the  possibility that  SLIT for cockroach  may  not be effective  due to limitations  in the  maximum  doses  that 
can be  provided with currently  available  extracts.  These  studies  have  also generated concerns  about  the likelihood  of 
compliance  with daily  SLIT therapy,  an issue  that may  both  reduce  efficacy and potentially  increase  risk. Given those  
concerns,  a pilot  study of cockroach  SCIT was also conducted  in 10  adults  (SCITCO,  ICAC -18) with a primary  focus  on 
safety in an effort  to lay the groundwork  for an efficacy  study  using SCIT.  The SCITCO  study  demonstrated an  excellent  
safety profile,  as well as robust  biomarkers  of immunologic  response.  Given that  mouse  allergen is also a key inner - 
city allergen,  and that there  is a paucity of experience  with  mouse  immunotherapy,  the current  study  is designed to 
provide  similar  safety and immunologic  data  for mouse  that SCITCO  provided for  cockroach.  
While  studies  of c ockroach  and mouse  are limited,  there  is a vast clinical  and research experience  with  the use of SCIT  
for the treatment  of asthma  and allergic rhinitis,  as well as stinging insect  hypersensitivit y.11,12    While  there is a higher  
risk of systemic  reactions  with SCIT  compared to  SLIT,  the overall  safety  profile  of SCIT  is very  favorable,  as is the 
overall SCIT  risk benefit  ratio  given the  marked  improvements  in disease  activity  demonstrated in  most  studies.  As 
with SLIT,  the efficacy of SCIT depends  on the use of adequate  dosages,  but we are confident  that for SCIT  the 
available  extracts  will prove  adequate  in this regard .11,13 
The rationale  for this study is  therefore  that immunotherapy,  focused  on key indoor  allergens,  will be effective  for the 
treatment of inner -city asthma,  and that  SCIT  is the best  option.  This preliminary study  is a logical next  step,  necessary  
to provide  data  regarding  both  safety  and immunogenicity  before  proceeding to an efficacy  trial.

1.2 Rationale for  Selection of  Investigational Product  or Intervention 
The study agent  for this protocol  is 1:20 w/v  glycerinated  mouse  epithelial allergenic  extract  administered by the 
subcutaneous  route  purchased from Greer Laboratories  (Lenoir,  NC).  Mouse  Epithelia  (Mus  musculus)  allergic  extract  
is approved in the  United  States  for diagnostic  skin testing and immunotherapy  by subcutaneous  injection (US License  
NO. 308).  While  mouse  SCIT has undergone  little  prior  study  and specific  dosing guidelines  have  not been established,  
there is a large  body of literature  for other  allergens  that can be  applied to  choose  a dose  schedule  for this protocol  
that should  maximize  safety  and efficacy. For other  allergens,  maintenance  doses  of major  allergens  ranging from  5 to 
15 micrograms  have  proven  effective  and our dosing  strategy  will seek  to achieve  a maintenance  dose  within  this 
range,  with  a secondary  goal of minimizing injection volume  so that this same  dose  could eventually be  applied to a 
multi -allergen  protocol  in pediatric  patients. 
1.3 Preclinical Experience 
Not applicable.  
 
1.4 Clinical  Studies  
Only  one study of mouse  immunotherapy  has previously  been published .14   That  study  was conducted in  23 laboratory  
animal workers,  11 of whom  received immunotherapy  with 12  different  extracts  (five  mouse,  six rat, one rabbit),  and 
12 were  matched untreated  controls.  The maximum  weekly  immunotherapy  dose  for the different  allergens  ranged  
from 2,000 to 10,000 protein nitrogen units  (PNU).  Among  the treated patients,  nine  of 11 subjectively  improved with  
immunotherapy  and blocking antibody titers  were  significantly  elevated in  the treated subjects  compared to the 
controls  (specific  data on mouse  were  not provided).  There  were  no systemic  reactions  reported,  nor any need to  
discontinue  dosing due  to adverse  reactions. 
It is important  to re cognize,  however,  that even  though there  are a minimal data  regarding mouse, there  is a vast body  
of literature  and cli nical  experience  with the use of SCIT for other  allergens. A recent  practice  parameter detailed the  
use of SCIT  for inhalant  allergens  as well as stinging ins ects.11   In addition,  meta -analyses  have  confirmed  the 
effectiveness  of SCIT  for the treatment  of asthma,  allergic  rhinitis, and stinging insect  hypersensitivity .15-18 A 2003  
Cochrane  review  of 75 trials,  including 3188 patients  with asthma,  found that  overall SCIT  led to  a significant  reduction  
in asthma  symptoms,  medication use,  and bronchial  hyperreactivity .16   For example,  in that review,  it was determined  
that it would have  been necessary  to treat  4 patients  with immunotherapy  to avoid 1 deterioration in asthma  
symptoms  and 5 patients  to avoid  1 requiring increased asthma  medication. 
 
 
2 Study  Hypotheses/Objectives  
2.1 Hypotheses  
The two hypotheses  tested  by this study  are 1) Subcutaneous  treatment with mouse  extract  can be  safely  
administered in adults  with  mouse  sensitivity and 2) Subcutaneous  treatment  with  mouse  extract can induce  
significant  changes  in serum  biomarkers  indicative  of immunologic  activity. 
2.2 Primary Objectives  
The primary objective  of this pilot  study  is to assess  if treatment with  mouse  SCIT,  using the  per protocol  allergenic  
extract  doses,  is safe.  This will be done  by determining the  rate of related adverse  events  and serious  adverse  events  
in the  course  of treatment.  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  14 of 37  
  
2.3 Secondary  Objective(s)  
1. To determine  wheth er a 24 week  treatment  with  mouse  SCIT,  using  the per protocol  allergenic  extract  doses,  
will induce  a 3- fold increase  in mouse -specific  serum  IgE. 
2. To determine  whether  a 24 week  treatment  with  mouse  SCIT,  using  the per protocol  allergenic  extract  doses,  
will induce  changes  in the  serum  levels  of mouse -specific  IgG and IgG4.  
3. To determine  whether  a 24 week  treatment  with  mouse  SCIT,  using  the per protocol  allergenic  extract  doses,  
will inhibit  the in-vitro mouse  antigen binding to  B-cells. 
 
 
3 Study  Design  
3.1 Description of  Study  Design  
This study  is an open  label  multi -site trial of mouse allergenic  extract  administered by  subcutaneous  injection  in 
approximately 10 - 12 adults  ages  18 to 55 years  with  asthma.  The study will  be based on a continuous  treatment 
schedule  with mouse  allergenic  extract  for a period of approximately 24 weeks.  It is primarily  designed  to study  the 
safety of this therapy.

Dose  Initiation  
 
There will be a Screening Visit  followed by a Dose  Initiation Visit,  at which the  subject  will receive  their  first injection.  
Up to 2 doses  of SCIT  will be given  weekly  during dose  escalation,  separated by  a minimum of 2 days.  Dose  escalation  
will occur  over  a minimum of 11 weeks.  Dose  escalation can be  delayed at  any point  if there  are excessive large  local  
reactions  or other  concerns,  although to continue  on to maintenance  each subject  will need to  reach  the maintenance  
dose  in a maximum of 18 weeks.  Once  the maintenance  dose  is achieved,  bi-weekly visits  will continue  to complete  a 
total  of 24 weeks  of treatment.  
Blood  will be collected at  baseline  and then monthly  for assessment  of biomarkers  of allergen immunotherapy,  
including mouse  specific  IgE, IgG, IgG4,  and inhibition of mouse  antigen  binding to B-cells.  Mouse  skin testing will be 
performed at  screening.  (See  Visit  Activities  Summary,  Appendix  A) 
Adverse  events  (AEs) will be assessed at each study visit.  Allergy and asthma symptom  questionnaires  will also be 
administered throughout  the study.  
3.2 Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint  is the number  of reported adverse  events  and serious  adverse events,  including their  severity,  
seriousness, and treatment  relatedness.  
3.3 Secondary  Endpo ints 
1. Change  in mouse specific  IgE. 
2. Change  in mouse specific  IgG and IgG4. 
3. Change  in in -vitro mouse  antigen binding to B-cells

4 Selection  of Participants  and Clinical  Sites/Laboratories  
4.1 Rationale for  Study Population 
Because  the combination of  mouse  allergy and  mouse  exposure  is one of the most  important  factors  contributing to 
the asthma  morbidity seen  in inner  city children  with asthma,  a major  ICAC  goal is to conduct  an immunotherapy  
efficacy trial  that will include  mouse  allergen.   Given  that there  has been so little  study of mouse  immunotherapy,  
adults  will be studied in this  safety  trial.

6. Have  not re ceived and refuse  to receive  the Flu Vaccine.  
 
 
5 Known  and Potential  Risks  and Benefits  to Participants  
5.1 Risks  of Study Procedures  
Risks  of exposing participants  to allergens  via immunotherapy  include,  but are not limited to:  itching of the mouth,  
ears,  and throat,  itching  or swelling of  the eyes,  nasal congestion,  sneezing,  rhinorrhea,  oral or throat  angioedema,  
cough,  chest  tightness,  wheezing,  gastrointestinal  symptoms  (vomiting,  diarrhea,  abdominal  pain),  skin symptoms  
(rash,  hives,  swelling,  itching),  and anaphylaxis.  We expect  that the main  sign/symptom experienced by participants  
will be localized swelling at  the injection  site occurring within  30 minutes  after administration  of the immunotherapy  
injection.  Large  local  reactions  associated w ith allergen  immunotherapy  are common,  with  a frequency  ranging from  
26%  to 86%  of injection s.19 
In published studies  of SCIT,   systemic  anaphylactic  reactions  with  other  inhalant  allergens  have  been reported to 
occur  in from  1% of patients  to as many as  36%  of patients  receiving  SCIT  using a rush schedul e.20,21    This study  does  
not involve  a rush immunotherapy  schedule.  Fatalities  are very  rare but have  been  reported,  as have  specific  risk 
factors  for fatal  reactions,  which include  unstable  asthma,  beta -blocker  therapy,  rush immunotherapy,  and use of high  
doses  of potent  standardized extracts .20 In our SCITCO  study,  in 10  adults  undergoing six  months  of SCIT,  there  were  2 
serious  adverse  events  reported,  neither  of which  were  considered  related  to the therapy .22 
The risks  to a fetus  are unknown  and SCIT  is generally  not initiated during pregnancy.  Pregnant  females  will be 
excluded from  the present protocol.  Urine  pregnancy testing will be performed at  the Screening Visit  and monthly  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  17 of 37  
  
thereafter  to ensure  no pregnant  female will  be entered into the study  and any  female  becoming pregna nt during the  
course  of the study will  be discontinued.  
5.2 Potential Benefits  
There are no known potential  benefits  for the participant  in this  trial.  The participant’s  allergic  rhinitis  or asthma  may  
or may  not improve  while  in this study.  In the longer  term,  this study may  promote  the further  development  of mouse  
SCIT  for asthma  and allergic  rhinitis,  which  could be  a major  advance  in the care  of individuals  with these  conditions  
who  are allergic  to mouse  antigens. 
 
 
6 Investigational  Agent  
6.1 Investigational  Agent  
Participants  will receive  escalating doses  of glycerinated  mouse  allergenic  extract  or placebo  administered via the 
subcutaneous  route  up to a Maximum  Study Dose  (MSD)  of 0.4 ml of extract  at a concentration of 1:20 wt/vol.  
 
6.1.1 Formulation,  Packaging,  and Labeling  
The investigational agent  is glycerinated  mouse  allergenic  extract  (50%  Glycerin).  The active  ingredient of the 
investigational  agent  is a non-standardized allergen derived  from the  extraction  and purification  of proteins  from  
mouse  epithelia  (mouse  epithelial  extract ). 
The investigational agent will be manufactured Greer  laboratories,  Lenoir  NC. Glycerinated  Mouse  Epithelia  (Mus  
musculus)  allergic  extract is approved in the  United States  for diagnostic  skin testing and immunotherapy  by 
subcutaneous  injection (US  License  NO. 308).   It has been used in humans  for at least  35 years.  Dosage,  Preparation,  
and Administration  
Initial  dilutions  of t he mouse  allergenic  extract  needed  for dose  escalation  will be prepared by  a research pharmacy.  
Complete  details  can be  found in the  Manual  of Operations  (MOP),  which is  based on the DAIT  Pharmacy  manual  and 
AAAAI practice  parameters. 
Participants  will receive  escalating doses  of glycerinated  mouse  allergenic  extract  administered via the subcutaneous  
route  up to a MSD of 0.4 ml  of extract  at a concentration of 1:20 wt/vol.  See Section 8.45 for the dose  escalation  
schedule.  
The investigational agent  will be shipped by the  manufacturer as per their  approved method.  On site the 
investigational  agent  will be stored at  -2° C. 
6.2 Drug Accountability  
Under  Title  21 of the Code  of Federal  Regulations  (21CFR  §312.62)  the investigator  will maintain adequate  records  of 
the disposition  of the investigational  agent,  including the  date  and quantity of the drug received,  to whom the  drug  
was dispensed (participant -by-participant  accounting),  and a detailed accounting  of any drug accidentally  or 
deliberately  destroyed.  
Records  for receipt,  storage,  use, and disposition  will be maintained by the  study site.  A drug -dispensing log will be 
kept  current  for each participant.  This log will  contain the  identification  of each  participant  and the  date  and quantity  
of drug dispensed.  
 
All records  regarding the  disposition of the investigational product  will be available  for inspection.  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  18 of 37  
  
Unused product  will be destroyed by the  study  site after accountability requirements  have  been met and approval  has 
been received from DAIT/NIAID. 
6.3 Assessment  of Participant  Compliance with  Investigational  Agent  
As participants  will receive  their  injections  in the clinic,  compliance  will be monitored by  assessing the  number  of 
completed and missed clinic  visits. 
6.4 Toxicity  Prevention and Management  
In the  case  of a reaction to the  study medication,  dosing  will be altered in  the following  manner:  
 
• For local  reactions  6-11 cm in diameter,  the dose  will be repeated.  
 
• For local  reactions  greater  than 12 cm, the dose  will be reduced  to the prior  dose  during escalation and cut  by 
50%  while  on maintenance  with re -escalation  the following week.  
 
• For mild systemic  symptoms  (Grade  1 anaphylaxis),  the dose  will be reduced by 2 doses  during escalation  or 
reduced cut  by 75%  while  on maintenance  with  re-escalation  over  the next  2 weeks.  
6.5 Premature Discontinuation o f Investigational  Agent  
Participants  who  are unable  to complete  the first 8 injections  following the  Dose  Initiation Visit  will be unable  to 
proceed to  the maintenance  period and may  be replaced (see  Section  11.2,  Participant  Stopping Rules  and Withdrawal 
Criteria ). Subjects  unable  to continue  beyond that  point  will not be replaced.   A final blood  sample  will be drawn on 
participants  who  need to  discontinue  therapy.  
 
Study  therapy may  be prematurely  discontinued for  any participant  for any of the following reasons:  
 
1. SAE related to  investigational agent  
2. Anaphylactic  reaction grade  2 or 3 (see Section 12.3.2,  Grading Criteria  for Anaphylaxis ) 
3. Inability  to tolerate the  build up to or the MSD  due to excessive  discomfort/symptoms  or large  local  reactions  
after  a second attempt  at dose  escalation  
4. Development  of any serious  medical  illness  whose  natural history,  sequela,  or treatment would be  worsened  
or impaired by continuation in the  protocol  
5. The study treatment is no longer  in the best  interest of the participant  
6. Pregnancy  
 
 
7 Other  Medications

Participants  may  use antihistamines  as needed for  large  local reactions  to the injections.  In the  event  of a rare,  but 
severe  reaction to the  glycerinated  mouse  allergenic  extract  away  from  the study  site, participants  will receive  2 
epinephrine  auto -injectors  during the  Dose  Initiation  Visit. Participants  must  sign the  epinephrine  auto -injector  
training form  and understand its  use before  they  can be enrolled in the  study and receive the  investigational agent.  
 
 
8 Study  Procedures  
8.1 Recruitment  
The study center  may  use any IRB-approved  means  to identify  potential  participants.  Examples  include  hospital,  clinic,  
or emergency department  admission records; investigators’  specialty clinic  records;  and advertising (in public  locations  
and on the radio). Potential  participants  will be screened and recruited using a standardized questionnaire  that   
collects  contact  information and inclusion/exclusion criteria information. Participants  may  be recruited by phone  or in  
person.  
Retention  methods  involve  a number  of different  approaches.  Appointment  reminder  cards  are given at  each visit.  
We will use an appointment  reminder  system that  consists of phone  calls  and/or  text messages several  days  and one  
day prior  to scheduled appointments  for confirmation.  To facilitate  telephone  contact  with subjects  whose  phone  
service  may  change  during  the study,  at least  three telephone  contact  numbers  (relatives,  neighbors,  friends)  will be 
collected for  each subject.  This has proven  to be an effective  strategy  in previous  ICAC  studies.  Those  who  have  no 
obvious  characteristics  making them  ineligible  and who  are interested  will be invited  to the clinic  for a Screening Visit.  
8.2 Screening/Baseline Visit  
Th
is research study  will be explained in lay terms  to each potential  research participant. The potential  participant  will 
provide  informed  consent  before  he or she undergoes  any screening study  procedures.  Written informed consent  and 
Health Insurance  Portability  and Accountability Act  (HIPAA)  authorization  will be obtained from  all participants  at the 
beginning of this  visit.  Study  procedures  will be stopped and the  participant  will be deemed ineligible  for the study at  
any point  during the  Screening Visit  if and when  they  fail to meet  eligibility criteria.  
After  the consent  is signed,  participants  will undergo screening study procedures,  including prick  skin tests  with mouse  
allergenic  extract  to ensure  participants  are sensitive  to the test product,  since  those  who do  not react  to mouse  are 
excluded from  the remainder of the study.  In addition,  participants  will be tested  with:  American cockroach,  German  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  20 of 37  
  
cockroach,  cat, dog,  Alternaria,  house  dust  mite,  and selected seasonal  aeroallergen  allergenic  extracts,  as specified in 
the study MOP,  to characterize  the study  population.  
A medical  history will  be taken and a targeted  physical  examination will  be performed  to verify  the participant’s  
suitability  for inclusion in the  study.  A urine  pregnancy  test will also be performed  on all female  participants. 
Spirometry will be performed by  all participants  to verify  the participant’s  suitability  for inclusion in the  study.  
Candidates  whose  FEV1 is  less than  70% of predicted  normal  will be excluded;  however,  if their  asthma  can be brought  
under  control  within 2 months,  as described in Sectio n 8.3, they  are eligible  for rescreening. 
 
Blood  will be collected by venipuncture  for mouse -specific  IgE antibody testing.  
 
Participants  must  agree  to receive  a flu vaccine  if they are  in the  study  during flu  season.  Participants  will be offered a 
flu vaccine  when it becomes  available.  Participants  may  choose  to receive  the flu vaccine  outside  of the study.  
Participants  who  have  both a positive  skin prick  test to mouse  allergenic  extract  and a mouse -specific  IgE ≥ 0.10 kU A/L 
and are  considered  eligible  for the study,  and at  the discretion of  the study clinician,  will be invited to proceed to the 
Dose  Initiation Visit. 
 
8.3 Asthma  Control  Optional  Visits  
Participants  who s e FEV1  is less than  70% of predicted  normal  or whose  asthma  is not well controlled  as defined by  the 
inclusion and exclusion  criteria  may  qualify  for rescreening if  their  condition improves  while  recruitment  is ongoing. 
8.4 Dose Initiation  
The Dose  Initiation Visit  will be scheduled  according to the guidelines  in the MOP.  
 
Written  instructions  on the proper  use, storage,  and administration  of the epinephrine  auto -injector  will be given to  
participants  at the Dose  Initiation Visit.  Participants  must  sign the  epinephrine  auto -injector  training form and  
understand its use before  being enrolled in the study and receiving the  investigational agent.  Participants  will receive  
2 epinephrine  auto -injectors  during the  Dose  Initiation Visit.  
Blood  will be collected by venipuncture  and will  be tested for  assessment  of biomarkers of allergen immunotherapy,  
such as  mouse -specific  IgE and IgG4  antibodies.  
The first injection  will contain 0.05 mL  of 1:10,000 concentration of  1:20 w/v  glycerinated  mouse  allergenic  extract  as 
detailed in the  Dose  Escalation  Table  8.5.1. Each injection will  be administered by  the research staff  along  with any  
rescue  medications,  as required.  Refer  to the MOP  for information on handling treatment -related reactions.  Prior to 
the administration of  each  dose  of allergenic  extract,  the study clinician  will assess  the eligibility of the participant  to 
receive  the allergenic  extract  injection and  will review any  side-effects  or adverse  reactions  experienced by the  
participant. Participants  will report  symptoms,  using a questionnaire,  30 minutes  after  each  injection is administered  
in order to identify side effects.  During all  dosing visits,  a clinician  and appropriate  emergency supplies  will be readily  
available  to treat  any adverse  reactions.  Study  participants  will remain  at the clinic  for obse rvation for at least  30 
minutes  after  each  allergenic  extract  injection.  
All participants  rec eiving the initial  dose  will have  information gathered and assessed on any delayed reactions  or side 
effects  experienced,  regardless  of whether  or not they continue  on to the 24 week  treatment course.

* During dose  escalation,  2 injections  will be given each week separated by at least  2 days  
** Dose  escalation  may  be accomplished  over  a maximum of 18 weeks  
*** During maintenance,  doses  will be given every  2 weeks  
 
 
For the first 11 weeks  of the 24-week  treatment  course  participants  will receive  two injections  per week,  separated by  
at least  2 days,  at the escalating doses  as described in  Table  8.5.1 . Dose  escalation can be  delayed at any point  if there 
are excessive  large  local reactions  or other  concerns,  although to  continue  on to maintenance  each subject  will need  
to reach the maximum study  dose  in a maximum of 18 weeks.  A clinician  and appropriate  emergency  supplies  will be 
readily  available  to treat  any adverse  reactions. Participants  will be discharged after  the 30 minute  waiting period if  
they  show  no signs  or symptoms  greater  than mild,  as defined in Section 12.3.1,  or at the discretion  of the study  
clinician. 
Dose  escalation will  continue  according to the schedule  unless  there  are lapses  in dosing or reactions  occur.   Dosing  
will be modified as  follows  for lapses  in dosing or reactions:  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  22 of 37  
  
• For a lapse  in dosing of more  than two weeks  during escalation,  the dose  from the previous  visit will be 
repeated.  
• For a lapse  in dosing of more  than three  weeks  during  escalation,  the subject will be discontinued from the  
protocol.  
 
• For one missed dosing visit while  on maintenance,  the maintenance  dose  will be continued. 
 
• For two missed  maintenance  doses  while  on maintenance,  the dose  will be reduced by 50%  and re -escalated  
the following week.  
• For more  than  two consecutive  missed dosing visits  while  on maintenance,  the subject  will be discontinued  
from the  protocol.  
 
• For local  reactions  6-11 cm in diameter,  the dose  will be repeated.  
 
• For local  reactions  greater  than 12 cm, the dose  will be reduced  to the prior  dose  during escalation and cut  by 
50%  while  on maintenance  with re -escalation  the following week.  
• For mild systemic  symptoms  (Grade  1 anaphylaxis),  the dose  will be reduced by 2 doses  during escalation  or 
reduced cut  by 75%  while  on maintenance  with  re-escalation  over  the next  2 weeks.  
 
Participants  who  are unable  to reach the  Maximum  Study  Dose  by 18 weeks  following  the Dose  Initiation Visit  will be 
unable  to proceed to the  maintenance  period and  may be  replaced (see  Section 11.2,  Participant  Stopping Rules  and 
Withdrawal  Crite ria). 
 
8.5.2 Maintenance Visits  
For the remaining time  of the 24 week  treatment course,  participants  will receive  one injection  of investigational  
agent  every  2 weeks.  
Participants  will be instructed to immediately  report  any severe  sign or symptom possibly  related  to the subcutaneous  
administration  of the investigational agent  and to  contact  the study  site when they  need  medical  advice. For those  
participants  with asthma,  exacerbations  will be handled through an approach consistent  with standard clinical  practice  
as described in  the MOP.  
8.6 Final  Study  Visit  
A final study visit will  be performed for all participants  who began study treatment,  regardless  of whether  or not they  
entered  or completed the 24 week  treatment  course.  The final  visit will include:  
• Final  physical  exam  
• Blood  draw  
• Spirometry  
• Pregnancy test  (females  only)  
 
Participants  recording only mild or  no symptoms  at the last office  visit will be discharged from the  study.  Participants  
recording  moderate  or severe  symptoms  at the last office  visit will require  follow -up as  described in 12, Safety  
Monitoring and Reporting.

8.7 Early  Termination Visit  
Participants  may withdraw  or be dropped from  the study  during or between study  visits,  according to the criteria  in 
Section  11.2,  Participant  Stopping Rules  and Withdrawal  Criteria. For participants  who withdraw  or are dropped during  
a study visit,  the visit will be terminated.  The study  clinician  will perform  a final  clinical  assessment,  including blood  
collection  and a targeted physical  exam,  as described in Section 8.6. 
Participants  who  withdraw  or are dropped from  the study  between  visits  will be contacted by phone  and will be  
invited to the  study  center  for a final  asse ssment  as described in Section  8.6 above.  For participants  who refuse  to 
come  to the clinic,  the final  clinical  assessment  as described above  may  be conducted over  the phone. Besides this  
visit,  no further follow -up will  be made,  except for participants  who  are discontinued due  to pregnancy or SAEs.  These  
participants  will be contacted to determine  the outcome  of the pregnancy or the SAE.  Refer  to Section 12.6,  Pregnancy  
Reporting,  for more  information  on AE reporting  for pregnancy.  
8.8 Pregnancy  Visit  
Females  who  become  pregnant  during the  study will  be discontinued immediately  and no further  study  procedures  
will be performed.  These  participants  will be followed  to determine  the outcome  of the pregnancy; otherwise  no 
further  follow -up will be made.  
8.9 Unscheduled Visits  
St
udy participants  may  attend unscheduled visits  for a medical evaluation if  they  experience  moderate  to severe  
symptoms.  
8.10 Visit  Windows  
During dose  escalation,  2 injections  will be given each  week  separated by at least  2 days.  Dose  escalation  may  be 
accomplished  over  a maximum of 18 weeks.  
Bi-weekly maintenance  visits  will be scheduled  within  the second  calendar  week  following the  previous  maintenance  
visit. See the MOP for details  regarding visit  scheduling.  
 
 
9 Mechanistic  Assays  
Whole  blood will  be collected by venipuncture  every  month  during the  maintenance  period,  and will  be processed  
according to the  MOP.  The blood  will be tested for  biomarkers  of allergen immunotherapy,  such as mouse -specific  IgE, 
IgG, IgG4  antibodies,  and in -vitro mouse  antigen binding  to B-cells  (see Appendix  A). 
 
 
10 Biospecimen  Storage  
Unused samples  of biological  specimens  (blood)  collected  during the  course  of the study will  be stored  (described in  
the MOP)  for future  use for tests  that may or may  not be planned.  These  tests  may  or may  not be related  to the study  
of asthma  and allergy. Participants  will be asked to  give permission for  long -term  storage  and future  use during  the 
consent  process.  Samples  may  be stored indefinitely.

12 Safety  Monitoring  and Reporting  
12.1 Overview  
This section defines  the types  of safety  data  that will be collected under  this protocol  and outlines  the procedures  for 
appropriately  collecting,  grading,  recording,  and reporting those  data.  Adverse  events  that are classified  as serious  
according to the  definition  of the FDA must  be reported promptly  (per Section  12.5,  Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  
Events  and Adverse  Events ) to DAIT/NIAID. Appropriate  notifications  will also be made  to site principal  investigators,  
and to the Institutional  Review  Boards  (IRBs).  
Information in  this section  complies  with ICH Guideline  E2A:  Clinical  Safety Data Management:  Definitions  and 
Standards  for Expedited Reporting,  ICH Guideline  E-6: Guideline  for Good  Clinical Practice,  21CFR  Parts  312 and 320,  
and applies  the standards  set forth in the  National Cancer  Institute (NCI),  Common  Terminology  Criteria for Adverse  
Events  (CTCAE), Version  4.03,  June  14, 2010:  http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
 
12.2 Definitions  
 
12.2.1 Adverse Event  (AE) 
An adverse  event  is any untoward or unfavorable  medical  occurrence  associated with the subject’s  participation in the 
research, whether  or not considered related to  the subject’s  participation in the  research  (modified from  the  
definition  of adverse  events  in the  1996 International  Conference  on Harmonization E-6 Guidelines  for Good  Clinical  
Practice)  (from OHRP "Guidance  on Reviewing and  Reporting Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks  to Subjects  or 
Others  and Adverse  Events  (1/15/07)"  (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2  ) 
 
For this study,  a related adverse  events  will include  any untoward  or unfavorable  medical  occurrence  associated with:  
 
Study  therapy  regimen: Mouse  Allergenic  Extract  Administered by the  Subcutaneous  Route  
 
• Eye symptoms  (itchy,  runny,  swelling)  
• Nose  symptoms  (sneezing,  itching,  runny,  stuffy)  
• Mouth/ears/throat  symptoms  (itchy mouth,  throat  irritation,  oral or throat  angioedema,  cough,  
itchy  ears)  
• Skin symptoms  (angioedema,  urticaria,  generalized itching,  rash)  
• Gastrointestinal  symptoms  (vomiting,  diarrhea,  cramps,  nausea)  
• Chest  (cough,  tightness,  wheezing)  
• Anaphylaxis  
• Injection  site reaction  ≥ 6 cm in diameter 
 
 
Study  mandated procedures:  
Allergen Scratch  Skin Testing  
• Prolonged (>24  hours)  itching at  test site 
• Swelling (> 10 cm ) at site of test lasting  more  than 24 hours  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  26 of 37  
  
• Nasal allergic  symptoms  within 30 minutes of the procedure  
• Fainting/Vasovagal  event  within 30 minutes  of the procedure  
• Anaphylaxis  
 
Blood  Draws  
 
• Fainting/Vasovagal  events  
• Bruising at  puncture  site larger  than 2 cm diameter  
• Bleeding from  puncture  site lasting  more  than  30 minutes  
• Swelling at  puncture  site larger than 2 cm 
 
Pulmonary  Function  Testing  
 
• Wheezing or bronchoconstriction requiring treatment  with bronchodilators  within 30 minutes  
from the  procedure  
• Coughing requiring treatment  with bronchodilators  within 30 minutes  from the  procedure  
 
 
12.2.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Suspected adverse  reaction  (SAR)  means  any adverse event  for which there  is a reasonable  possibility  that the 
investigational  study  therapy  regimen  caused the  adverse  event.  For the purposes  of safety reporting,  ‘reasonable  
possibility’  means  there is evidence  to suggest  a causal relationship between the drug and the  adverse  event.  A 
suspected adverse  reaction  implies  a lesser  degree  of certainty  about  causality than adverse  reaction,  which  means  
any adverse  event  caused  by a drug (21  CFR 312.32(a)).  
 
12.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse  event  or suspected adverse reaction is  considered  “unexpected” if  it is not listed in  the safety  information  
of Greer’s  package  insert  for allergenic  extracts  or is  not listed at  the specificity,  severity or rate of occurrence  that 
has been  observed; or is not consistent  with  the risk information  described  in the protocol. 
“Unexpected” also refers  to adverse  events  or suspected adverse  reactions  that are mentioned in the package  insert  
as occurring with a class  of drugs  or as  anticipated  from  the pharmacological properties  of the drug,  but are not 
specifically  mentioned as  occurring with the particular drug under  investigation  (21 CFR 312.32(a).  
 
12.2.4 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  
An adverse  event  or suspected adverse reaction is  considered  “serious” if,  in the view  of either  the investigator  or 
DAIT/NIAID,  it results  in any  of the following  outcomes  (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 
1. Death:  A d eath that  occurs  during the  study or that comes  to the attention  of the investigator  during the  
protocol -defined follow -up period  must  be reported  whether  it is considered treatment  related  or not. 
2. A life-threatening event:  An AE or SAR is considered “life -threatening”  if, in the view of either  the 
investigator  or DAIT/NIAID,  its occurrence  places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.  It does  not 
include  an AE  or SAR that,  had it  occurred in a more  severe  form,  might  have  caused death.  
3. Inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing hospitalization.  
4. Persistent  or significant  incapacity or substantial  disruption  of the ability to conduct  normal  life functions.  
5. Congenital  anomaly  or birth  defect.  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  27 of 37  
  
6. Important  medical events  that may  not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require  hospitalization  may  
be considered serious  when,  based upon appropriate  medical judgment,  they may  jeopardize  the subject  
and may  require medical or surgical  intervention to  prevent  one of the outcomes  listed above.  
Elective  hospital izations  or hospital admissions  for the purpose  of conduct  of protocol  mandated procedures  are not 
to be reported  as an SAE  unless  hospitalization is  prolonged due  to complications. 
12.3 Grading and Attribution of  Adverse Events  
 
12.3.1 Grading Criteria  
The study  site will grade  the severity of adverse  events  experienced by the study  subjects according  to the criteria set 
forth in the  National  Cancer  Institute’s  Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE) (Version 4.03,  June  
14, 2010).  This document  (referred  to herein as the NCI-CTCAE  manual)  provides  a common language  to describe  
levels  of severity,  to analyze  and interpret  data,  and to  articulate  the clinical  significance  of all adverse  events.  The 
NCI-CTCAE  has been reviewed by the Protocol  Chair  and has  been deemed appropriate  for the subject  population to  
be studied in this  protocol.  
Adverse  events  will be graded on a scale  from 1 to 5 according to  the following standards  in the  NCI-CTCAE  manual:  
Grade  1 = mild adverse  event.  
Grade  2 = moderate  adverse  event.  
Grade  3 = severe  and undesirable  adverse  event.  
Grade  4 = life-threatening  or disabling adverse  event.  
Grade  5 = death.  
For grading an abnormal  val ue or result of a clinical  or laboratory evaluation  (including,  but not limited  to, a 
radiograph,  an ultrasound,  an electrocardiogram  etc.), a treatment -emergent  adverse event  is defined as  an increase  
in grade  from  baseline  or from the  last post -baseline  value  that doesn’t  meet  grading criteria. Changes  in grade  from  
screening to  baseline will also be recorded as  adverse  events,  but are not treatment -emergent.  If a specific  event  or 
result  from a given clinical  or laboratory evaluation is  not included in the NCI-CTCAE  manual,  then an abnormal  result  
would be  considered an adverse  event  if changes  in therapy or monitoring are implemented  as a result  of the 
event/result.  
 
12.3.2 Grading Criteria for  Anaphylaxis  
This study will  grade  anaphylaxis  as defined by  the following table,  adapted from the  grading scale  of Dr. Simon  
Brown .23

Table 12.3.2  Grading  System  of Severity of  Anaphylaxis  
 
Grade Defined By 
1. Mild  (skin  & subcutaneous  tissues,  GI, 
&/or  mild respiratory)  Flushing,  urticaria,  periorbital  or facial  angioedema; mild  
dyspnea,  wheeze  or upper  respiratory  symptoms; mild  
abdominal  pain and/or  emesis 
2. Moderate  (mild symptoms  + features  
suggesting moderate  respiratory,  
cardiovascular  or GI symptoms)  Marked  dysphagia,  hoarseness,  and/or  stridor;  SOB,  
wheezing & retractions;  crampy  abdominal pain,  
recurrent  vomiting and/or  diarrhea;  and/or  mild  
dizziness 
3. Severe  (hypoxia,  hypotension,  or 
neurological compromise)  Cyanosis  or SpO2 < 92%  at any stage,  hypotension,  
confusion,  collapse,  loss of consciousness; or 
incontinence  
 
 
12.3.3 Attribution Definitions  
The relationship,  or attribution,  of an adverse  event  to study  procedure(s)  will initially  be determined by the site 
investigator  and recorded  on the appropriate  AE/SAE  paper  case  report  form.  Final  determination  of attribution for 
safety reporting will  be determined by  DAIT/NIAID .  The relationship of an adverse  event  to study procedures  will be 
determined using the  descriptors  and definitions  provided in Table  12.3.3.

other  concurrent  mandated  study therapy  or study  
procedure) 
Unrelated  Category 
1 Unrelated The adverse  event  is clearly  not related. 
Related  Categories 
2 Possible The adverse  event  has a reasonable  possibility  to be 
related;  there  is evidence to suggest  a causal  relationship.  
3 Definite The adverse  event  is clearly  related. 
 
 
12.4 Collection and Recording of  Adverse Events  
Adverse  events  (including SAEs)  will be collected from  the time  of consent  until  a subject completes  study    
participation  or until  30 days  after  he/she  prematurely  withdraws  (without  withdrawing  consent)  or is withdrawn from  
the study.  
 
12.4.1 Collecting Adverse Events  
Adverse  events  (including SAEs)  may  be discovered  through any of these methods:  
 
• Observing  the participant.  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  29 of 37  
  
• Interviewing the  participant. 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint  from  the participant. 
• In addition,  an abnormal  value  or result  from  a clinical  or laboratory  evaluation  can also  indicate  an adverse  
event,  as defined in Section 12.3,  Grading and Attribution  of Adverse  Events . 
 
12.4.2 Recording  Adverse  Events  
Throughout  the study,  the investigator  at the site will record  adverse  events  and serious  adverse  events  as described 
previously  (Section 12.2,  Definitions ) on the appropriate  AE/SAE  eCRF  regardless  of the relationship to study  
procedure.  
Once  recorded,  an AE/SAE  will be followed until  it resolves  with  or without  sequelae,  or until  the end of study  
participation,  or until  30 days  after  the subject  prematurely  withdraws  (without  withdrawing consent)/or  is withdrawn  
from the  study,  whichever  occurs  first.  
12.5 Reporting  of Serious  Adverse Events  and Adverse  Events  
 
12.5.1 Reporting  of Serious Adverse Events  to DAIT/NIAID  
This section describes  the responsibilities  of the site investigator to report  serious  adverse  events  to the sponsor  via 
the SAE CRF. Timely reporting of adverse  events  is required by  21 CFR and ICH E6 guidelines. 
Site investigators  will report  to the SACCC  (Rho,  Inc.)  and DAIT/NIAID  all serious  adverse  events  (see Section 12.2.4,  
Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE) ), regardless  of relationship or expectedness  within 24 hours  of discovering  the event.  
For serious  adv erse events,  all requested information  on the AE/SAE  eCRF  will be provided.   However,  unavailable  
details  of the event  will not delay  submission  of the known information.  As additional  details  become  available,  the 
AE/SAE  eCRF  will be updated and submitted.  Every  time  the SAE eCRF is submitted,  it should be  signed by  the 
investigator.

12.5.2 Reporting to Health Authority  
This study will  be conducted  with an IND exemption;  therefore  no health  authority  reporting  will be required.  Annual  
and expedited  reported,  as described below,  will be submitted  to the DSMB  and IRB, as appropriate.  
12.5.2.1  Annual  Reporting  
DAIT/NIAID  will include  in the  annual  study  report  all adverse  events  classified  as: 
 
• Serious,  expected,  suspected adverse  reactions  (see Section 12.2.2,  Suspected Adverse  Reaction (SAR), and 
Section  12.2.3,  Unexpected Adverse  Event ). 
• Serious  and not  a suspected adverse  reaction (see  Section  12.2.2,  Suspected Adverse  Reaction (SAR) ). 
 
 
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  30 of 37  
  
• Pregnancies  not reported  as serious  adverse  events.  
 
Note  that all adverse  events  (not just those  requiring  24-hour  reporting)  will be reported annually.  
 
12.5.2.2  Expedited Safety  Reporting  
This option,  with  2 possible  categories,  applies  if the adverse  event  is classified as  one of the following:  
 
Category  1:  Serious  and unexpected suspected adverse reaction [SUSAR]  (see Section 12.2.2,  
Suspected Adverse  Reaction (SAR), and Section 12.2.3,  Unexpected Adverse  Event  and 21  CFR 
312.32(c)(1)i).  
The sponsor  must  report  any suspected adverse  reaction that  is both  serious  and unexpected.  The DAIT/NIAID must  
report  an adverse  event  as a suspected adverse  reaction only  if there  is evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship  
between the  study drug and the  adverse  event,  such as:  
1. A single  occurrence  of an event  that is uncommon  and known  to be strongly  associated with  drug exposure  
(e.g.,  Grade  3 anaphylaxis  as described in  Table  12.3.2);  
2. One or more  occurrences  of an event  that is not commonly  associated  with drug exposure,  but is otherwise  
uncommon in the  population exposed to the drug (e.g.,  tendon rupture);  
3. An aggregate  analysis  of specific  events  observed in a clinical  trial (such as  known consequences  of the 
underlying disease  or condition under  investigation  or other  events  that commonly  occur  in the  study  
population independent  of drug therapy)  that indicates  those  events  occur  more  frequently  in the  
drug treatment group than  in a concurrent  or historical control  group.  
Category  2: Any fi ndings  from  studies  that  suggests  a significant  human risk  
 
The sponsor  must  report  any findings  from other  epidemiological  studies,  analyses  of adverse  events  within the 
current  study  or pooled analysis  across  clinical studies  or animal or in vitro  testing (e.g.  mutagenicity,  teratogenicity,  
carcinogenicity)  that suggest a significant  risk in humans  exposed to the drug that  would result  in a safety -related  
change  in the  protocol,  informed consent,  investigator brochure  or package  insert  or other  aspects  of the overall  
conduct  of the study.  
DAIT/NIAID must  notify the  DSMB,  central  IRB, and all participating investigators  of expedited  Safety  Reports  within  15 
calendar  days;  unexpected  fatal  or immediately  life-threatening suspected adverse  reaction(s)  shall  be reported as  
soon  as possible  or within  7 calendar  days.  
 
12.5.3 Reporting  of Adverse Events  to IRBs  
All investigators  will report  adverse  events,  including expedited reports,  in a timely  fashion  to their  respective  IRBs  in 
accordance  with applicable  regulations  and guidelines.  
12.6 Pregnancy Reporting  
The investigator shall  be informed immediately of any pregnancy  in a study subject.  A pregnant  subject  shall  be 
instructed to stop  taking study  medication.  The investigator  shall counsel  the subject  and discuss  the risks  of 
continuing with the pregnancy  and the  possible  effects  on the fetus.  Monitoring  of the pregnant  subject  shall  continue  
until  the conclusion of the pregnancy.  
The investigator shall report  to the Statistical  and Clinical Coordinating Center  (SACCC)  and DAIT/NIAID all  pregnancies  
within 1 business  day of becoming aware  of the event  using the  Pregnancy eCRF.  All pregnancies  identified during the 
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  31 of 37  
  
study  shall  be followed to  conclusion and  the outcome  of each  must  be reported.  The Pregnancy eCRF  shall  be  
updated and submitted to the  Statistical  and Clinical  Coordinating Center  (SACCC) when details  about  the outcome  are 
available. 
 
Information requested about  the delivery  shall  include:  
 
• Gestational age at delivery  
• Birth weight,  length,  and head  circumference  
• Gender  
• Appearance,  pulse,  grimace,  activity,  and respiration (APGAR)  score  at 1 minute,  5 minutes,  and 24  hours  after 
birth,  if available  
• Any abnormalities. 
 
Should the  pregnancy  result  in a congenital  abnormality  or birth defect,  an SAE must  be submitted to  the Statistical  
and Clinical Coordinating Center  (SACCC)  and DAIT/NIAID  using the  SAE reporting  procedures  described above.  
12.7 Reporting  of Other  Safety Information  
An investigator shall  promptly  notify the  site IRB as well as the SACCC  and DAIT/NIAID  via email  when an 
“unanticipated problem  involving risks  to subjects  or others”  is identified,  which is not otherwise reportable  as an 
adverse  event.  
12.8 Review  of Safety Information  
 
12.8.1 Medical  Monitor  Review  
The DAIT/NIAID Medical  Monitor  shall  receive  monthly  reports  from  the SACCC  compiling new  and accumulating  
information  on AEs, SAEs,  and pregnancies  recorded  by the study site(s)  on appropriate  paper  CRFs.  
In addition,  the Medical  Monitor  shall  review  and make decisions  on the disposition of the SAE and pregnancy  reports  
received by the  SACCC  (See  Section s 12.5.1,  Reporting  o f Serious  Adverse  Events  to DAIT/NIAID  and 12.6,  Pregnancy  
Reporting ). 
 
12.8.2 DSMB  Review  
The SACCC  will provide  the DSMB  with listings  of all SAEs  on an ongoing  basis,  including quarterly  reports  of all SAEs.  
Furthermore,  the DSMB  will be informed  of expedited  reports  of SAEs. 
12.8.2.1 Planned DSMB  Reviews  
The NIAID  Asthma  and Allergy  Data  Safety and Monitoring Committee  (DSMB)  shall review  safety  data  at least  yearly  
during planned DSMB  Data Review  Meetings.  Data  for the planned safety  reviews  will include,  at a minimum,  a listing  
of all reported AEs  and SAEs.  
The DSMB  will be informed  of an  Expedited Safety  Report  in a timely manner.  An SAE which the  Medical  Monitor  
determines  to be an unexpected  safety  risk will be sent  to the DSMB  immediately. 
12.8.2.2 Ad hoc DSMB  Reviews  
In addition to  the pre-scheduled data  reviews  and planned safety monitoring,  the DSMB  may  be called upon for ad hoc  
reviews.  The DSMB  will review  any event  that potentially  impacts  safety  at the request  of the protocol  chair  or 
DAIT/NIAID.  In addition,  any occurrence  of meeting one  of the study  stopping rules  as described in Section 11.5 will  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  32 of 37  
  
trigger  an ad hoc  comprehensive  DSMB  Safety Review.  After  review  of the data,  the DSMB  will make  
recommendations  regarding study  conduct  and/or  continuation.  
12.8.2.3 Temporary  Suspension of Enrollment  and Drug Dosing  for ad hoc DSMB  Safety Review  
A temporary  halt in both  enrollment  and drug dosing will  be implemented if  an ad hoc DSMB  safety  review  is required. 
 
 
13 Statistical  Considerations  and Analytical  Plan  
13.1 Overview  
The primary objective  of this pilot  study  is to determine  if treatment  with  this dose  of mouse  SCIT  is safe.  Other  
secondary objectives  are to determine  whether  mouse  SCIT  will induce  a 3- fold increase  in mouse -specific  IgE, a 
biomarker  of allergen  immunotherapy,  when measured  over  24 weeks,  and to examine  changes  in levels  of mouse - 
specific  IgG and IgG4  over  the same  time  period  
13.2 Endpoints  
 
13.2.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint  is the number  of reported adverse  events  and serious  adverse events,  including their  severity,  
seriousness, and treatment  relatedness.  
13.2.2 Secondary  Endpoints  
1. Change  in mouse -specific  IgE. 
2. Change  in mouse -specific  IgG and IgG4.  
3. Change  in in -vitro mouse  antigen binding to B-cells.  
 
13.3 Measures  to Minimize  Bias 
This is a one arm open  label  study without  randomization.  All laboratory  assays  for serum IgE  and IgG  antibodies  will 
be performed in a central  laboratory. 
13.4 Analysis  Pla n 
 
13.4.1 Analysis  Population 
The study population consists  of adults  aged 18 through 55 years  who  have  a history of asthma  and are mouse  
sensitive.  The study will  examine  the safety  of the administration of non- standardized glycerinated mouse  allergenic  
extract  by subcutaneous  injection.  This is a phase  I safety  pilot  with no efficacy  measures; thus,  only one analysis  
population,  the safety  population,  will be defined for this study.  The safety  population  will include  all study  
participants  who  receive  the initial  injection  during the  Dose  Initiation Visit. All statistical analyses  will be performed  
on the Safety Population.  
 
13.4.2 Primary Analysis  of Primary  Endpoint(s)/Outcome(s)  
The primary objective  of this pilot  study  is to assess  if treatment  with  mouse  SCIT,  using the  per protocol  allergenic  
extract  doses,  is safe.  This will be done  by determining the  rate of related adverse  events  and serious  adverse  events  
in the  course  of treatment.  Frequency of AEs and SAEs  will be tabulated by  event,  organ,  seriousness,  severity,  and 
treatment relatedness.  
 
13.4.3 Analyses  of Secondary Endpoints  
Version  2.0 22 Jan 2016  
 Subcutaneous  Immunotherapy  for Mouse  Inner -City Asthma  Consortium  Confidential  Page  33 of 37  
  
The secondary  statistical  analyses  will include  summary  statistics  for the secondary  endpoints  and correlation  
analyses.  Endpoints  that are proportions  will be determined  along with  their  exact  95%  confidence  intervals  (Proc  
Freq,  SAS).  
Correlation analyses  will test for associations  between  baseline  allergy  diagnoses  (rhinitis,  asthma),  allergen  sensitivity  
(mouse -specific  IgE and IgG levels,  skin test  results),  and increased risk of AEs. Changes  from  baseline  levels  of mouse - 
specific  IgE, IgG, and IgG4  will be described in absolute  and relative  terms.  
 
13.4.4 Analyses  of Exploratory Endpoint(s)/Outcome(s)  
Not applicable.  
 
13.4.5 Descriptive  Analyses  
Not applicable.  
 
13.5 Interim  Analyses  
Not applicable.  
 
13.6 Sample Size  Considerations  
This is a single  center,  open- label,  nonblinded,  safety pilot  study with the  overall  objective  of demonstrating safety    
and determining the  tolerability  of glycerinated  mouse  allergenic  extract via the subcutaneous  route.  The proposed 
sample  size for this protocol  is 10 mouse -sensitive  participants,  and each participant  will receive  approximately 28  
injections.  This study  size will not provide  for definitive  assessment  of safety parameters.  Rather,  if symptomatic  
response  is sufficiently limited,  this study  group will  permit  larger subsequent  studies  for further  evaluations  of  
product  safety and efficacy.   Estimated event rates  for these safety -related  outcomes  depend on the sample  size and 
on the true  underlying event  rate.  The table  below  summarizes  the probabilities  of observing at  least  one event  given  
the sample  size of 280 injections  and the true event  rate.   For example,  if the true event  rate is 1%, the probability  that 
we observe  at least  one event  is 94%.  
 
Table 13.6  Probability of Observing Adverse  Events  According to  the “True”  Unknown Event  Rates  
 
“True” Unknown  Probability  of 
Event Probability  of 
Observing  at Least

0.01% 2.7% 
0.05% 13.1% 
0.1 % 24.4 % 
0.5 % 75.4 % 
1 % 94.0 % 
5 % >99.9% 
10 % >99.9% 
25 % >99.9% 
50 % >99.9% 
 
 
* Assuming event  probabilities  are independent  both  within and between  participants.  Any correlation between  event  
probabilities  would reduce  the probability of seeing at  least  one event.

14 Identification  and Access to Source Data 
14.1 Source Data  
Source  documents  and source  data  are considered to be  the original documentation where  subject  information,  visits  
consultations,  examinations  and other  information  are recorded.  Documentation of source  data  is necessary  for the 
reconstruction,  evaluation  and validation  of clinical findings,  observations  and other  activities  during a clinical  trial. 
14.2 Access  to Source Data  
The site investigators  and site staff  will make  all source  data available  to the DAIT/NIAID,  representatives  of the 
sponsor,  as well as to relevant  health authorities.  Authorized representatives  as noted  above  are bound to maintain 
the strict  confidentiality of medical  and research information that  may  be linked to identified individuals.  
 
 
15 Protocol  Deviations  
15.1 Protocol Deviation Definitions  
 
15.1.1 Protocol Deviation  
The investigators  and site  staff  will conduct  the study in accordance  to the protocol; no  deviations  from  the protocol  
are permitted.   Any change,  divergence,  or departure  from the  study  design or procedures  constitutes  a protocol  
deviation.   As a result  of any deviation,  corrective  actions  will be developed by  the site and implemented promptly.  
 
15.1.2 Major  Protocol  Deviation (Protocol  Violation)  
A Protocol  Violation is  a deviation from the  IRB-approved protocol  that may  affect  the subject's  rights,  safety,  or well- 
being and/or  the completeness,  accuracy and reliability  of the study  data.   In addition,  protocol  violations  include  
willful  or knowing breaches  of human subject  protection regulations,  or policies,  any action that  is inconsistent  with  
the NIH Human  Research  Protection Program’s  researc h, medical,  and ethical  principles,  and a serious  or continuing 
noncompliance  with federal,  state,  local or institutional  human subject  protection  regulations,  policies,  or procedures.  
 
15.1.3 Non -Major  Protocol  Deviation  
A non-major  protocol  deviation is  any change,  divergence,  or departure  from the  study  design or procedures  of a 
research protocol  that does  not have  a major  impact  on the subject's  rights,  safety or well-being,  or the completeness,  
accuracy and reliability  of the study  data. 
15.2 Reporting  and Managing  Protocol  Deviations  
The study site principal  investigator  has the responsibility  to identify,  document  and report  protocol  deviations.  
However,  protocol  deviations  may  also be identified during site monitoring  visits  or during other  forms  of study  
conduct  review. 
Upon determination  that a protocol  deviation  (major or minor)  has occurred,  the study  staff  will a) notify the  PI, b) 
notify the  SACCC, and c) complete  the Protocol  Deviation form.  The Protocol  Deviation form  will document  at a 
minimu m the date  PD occurred,  the date  PD identified,  a description  of event,  whether  the deviation resulted in  
SAE/AE,  the signature  of PI, report  to IRB, and documentation  of a corrective  action plan.   The SACCC  and DAIT/NIAID  
may  request  discussion with  the PI to determine  the effect  of the protocol  deviation on the study  participant  and 
his/her  further study participation,  the effect  of the protocol  deviation on the overall  study,  and corrective  actions.  
The PI will complete  and sign the  Protocol  Deviation form and submit  it to the SACCC and to  the site IRB, per IRB 
regulations. Major  protocol  deviations  will be reported to the DSMB  by the  NIAID  Medical  Monitor  at the Medical 
Monitor’s  discretion.

16 Ethical  Considerations and Compliance  with  Good  Clinical Practice  
16.1 Statement  of Compliance 
This clinical  study  will be conducted using good clinical  practice  (GCP), as delineated in Guidance  for Industry:  E6 Good  
Clinical Practice  Consolidated Guidance , and according to the criteria  specified in  this study protocol.  Before  study  
initiation,  the protocol  and the informed  consent  documents  will be reviewed and approved by the  local IRB. Any 
amendments  to the protocol  or to the consent  materials  will also be approved by  the local IRB before  they are 
implemented. 
16.2 Informed Consent  Process 
The consent  process  will provide  information about  the study to a prospective  participant  and will allow  adequate  time  
for review  and discussion prior  to his/her  decision.  The principal investigator  or designee  listed  on the delegation       
log will review  the consent  and answer  questions.  The consent  designee  must  be listed  on the delegation log,  have  
knowledge  of the study and received  training (from the  local  IRB, PI, or study  coordinator)  in the  consent  process   The 
prospective  participant  will be told that  being in the  trial is voluntary and that  he or she may withdraw  from the  study  
at any time,  for any reason.  All participants will read,  sign, and date  a consent  form  before  undergoing any  study  
procedures.  Consent  materials  will be presented in participants’  primary language.  A copy of the signed consent  form  
will be given to the  participant. 
The consent  form will  be revised  when important  new  safety information is  available,  the protocol  is amended,  and/or  
new  information becomes available  that may  affect  participation  in the  study.  
16.3 Privacy  and  Confidentiality  
A participant’s  privacy  and confidentiality will  be respected  throughout  the study.   Each  participant  will be assigned a 
unique  identification  number  and these  numbers  rather  than names  will be used  to collect,  store,  and report  
participant  information.  Site personnel  will not transmit  documents  containing personal  health identifiers  (PHI) to the  
study  sponsor  or their  representatives.  
 
 
17 Publication  Policy  
Presentations  and publication of the results  of this trial will be governed by  the ICAC  Publication  Policy.

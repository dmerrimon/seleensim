 Summary of Changes from Version  01 to 02 : 
Affected 
Section(s)  Summary of Revisions Made (01 to 02)  Rationale  
1.1 
Schedule of 
Activities  Corrected footnote “h” in Schedule of Activities so that the 
footnote matched the table.  Specifically changed 
“screening” to “baseline.”  Inadvertent oversight during 
proofreading.  
6.5 
Concomitant 
Therapy  Added information about allowable Vitamin D dosage in 
over-the-counter vitamins that the participants may take.  Requested in UAMS IRB 
conting ency letter  of 09/13/2018  
8.1.2  
Laboratory 
Evaluations  Corrected “complete blood count” to “platelet” where the 
change was  not made prior to initial IRB subm ission.  Prior to initial IRB submission, a 
decision was made to change 
one of the lab tests from 
“complete blood count” to 
“platelet count.”  This change 
was inadvertently not made 
consistently throughout the 
protocol.  
10.1.9.1  
Data Collection 
& Management 
Responsibilities  
 Added paragraph noting that data will not be de-identified 
by the sites, but will be de-identified before it is shared 
outside of the network.  Requested in UAMS IRB 
conting ency letter  of 09/13/2018  
 
 
Summary of Changes from Version  02 to 03 : 
Affected 
Section(s)  Summary of Revisions Made (02 to 03)  Rationale  
Title page 
and section 
10.1.5  Added Jason Lang, MD, PhD to title page and corrected 
affiliation  Simple correction.  
Title page 
and section 
10.1.5  Removed Dr. Greg Kearns name from protocol.  Dr. Kearns is no longer working 
on protocol.  
Sections 1 
and 4.1,  Increase number of participants that can be randomized in 
part 1 of the study .  Increased from 32 to 50.  This is to ensure adequate 
numbers in each group for 
pharmacokinetic analyses.  
Sections  1; 
1.1;  3; 
8.1.2 ; and  
9.4.10  Made specimen collection optional for platelets.  Specimens for platelet analysis 
cannot be frozen or held for 
extended periods. This will allow 
sites to schedule participants for 
Friday and Saturday visits  
Sections 
1.1; 4.1; 
4.4; 6.1.2;  
8.1.1.1; and 
8.2    Corrected/clarified timeframes for scheduling visits to make it 
clear that all visits are in relation to baseline visit (Visit 2).  
 There were inconsistencies within 
the protocol regarding scheduling 
of visits.

 Affected 
Section(s)  Summary of Revisions Made (02 to 03)  Rationale  
Section 1.1; 
8.1.1.1 
(screening 
and 
baseline 
visits)  Removed requirement to do a focused physical examination 
as a routine part of the study.  
 
 Not essential to protocol.  
Sections 
2.3.3; 4.1; 
and  5.2,  Corrected use of terminology for randomization and 
enrollment.  Technical correction/clarification.  
Section 5.1  Annotated “abnormal liver function” to indicate values need to 
also be clinically significant (per site investigator).  Clarification.  
Sections 5.2  Clarified/revised used of “restricted” and “excluded” with 
regard to medication.  Noted that excluded medication cannot 
be used, not only within 30 days prior to enrollment, but also 
at any time during the run- in period.    Clarification.  
Section 5.2 
and  8.1.1.1 
(Visit 2)  Changed “return greater than or equal to 75% of diary cards” 
to “return diary cards with a complet ion rate greater than or 
equal to 75%.”  Clarification/correction.  
Section 5.4  Inserted “Participants who were terminated due to a screen 
fail must sign new consent/assent documents prior to 
rescreening.”  Clarification.  
Section 5.5, 
(Recruit -
ment)  Added paragraph to allow for collection of information about 
why potential participants decline to be in the study.  New.  
Sections 
6.1.2; 6.4; 
and  8.1.1.1  Added that diary cards will be used for follow -up visits in 
addition to Visits 1- 6. These diary cards will not have a line for 
recording if vitamin D pills were taken. Concomitantly, diary 
cards for visits in which Vitamin  D is dispensed will be “diary 
cards for dosing visits.”  New.  
Section 6.5  Clarified what is a study d eviation with regard to use of 
excluded medication.  Clarification.  
Section 6.5  In excluded medication list, the “calcifediol (vitamin D2)” was 
changed to “Vitamin D2.”  Technical correction.  
Sections 
7.1;  and  
8.2 Deleted “calcium and creatinine” each measured in mg/ml”  Phrase was causing confusion at 
sites.  
Section 7.2  Add “at the discretion of the site investigator” to 
discontinuation due to non- compliance.  Clarification.  
Section 
8.1.1.1 
(Visit 1)  Revised daily diary cards for visit 1. Cards for visit 1 will no 
longer have a line to collect information about taking 
Vitamin  D pill s. Correction made to diary cards.

 Affected 
Section(s)  Summary of Revisions Made (02 to 03)  Rationale  
Section 
8.1.1.1 
(Visit 1)  Added that participants whose safety laboratory values 
exceed thresholds will be referred to primary care physician.  Clarification for safety.  
Section 
8.1.1.1 
(Visit 2).  Clarified that sites must verify participants continue to meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria at baseline (visit 2).  Clarification/reinforcement of 
requirement.  
Section 
8.1.2.  Referenced lab manual for specimen collection methods for 
central lab; deleted specifications for collection methods that 
were in this protocol.  Some specification in protocol 
were not accurate.   
Section 
8.1.2  Revised inclusion criteria in later part of protocol to include the 
specification that Vitamin D level must be greater than 10 
ng/ml, as well as less than 30 ng/ml, to meet inclusion criteria.  Corrected within protocol 
inconsistency.  
Section 8.2.  Deleted “…or they may proceed to a total serum calcium 
measurement (if preferred in order to obviate a return visit).”  
A second urine calcium/creati nine is required prior to getting a 
specimen for blood calcium.   Corrected within protocol 
inconsistency. A second urine 
calcium/creatinine is required prior 
to collecting blood for a blood 
calcium level.  
Section 
8.3.3.3  Added list of expected AEs  Clarification.  
Section 
8.3.9  “Reporting of Pregnancy” section re-written  Clarification and to eliminate the 
requirement to follow infants for 
“up to 2 months.”  
Section 
9.4.3  Corrected “…25(OH)D greater than or equal to 0 ng/ml during 
a desired time period ..”  to “… 25(OH)D greater than or equal 
to 40 ng/ml during a desired time period ..” Typographical error.  
Section 
10.2 Deleted unused abbreviations (GLP and IDE) from table.  Correction of inconsistency.  
 
 
Summary of Changes from Version  03 to 04 :  
(primarily addressing contingencies from version 03 but also removing requirement to collect specimens 
for platelets  and allowing for more than weekly contact between visits .) 
 
Affected 
Section(s)  Summary of Revisions Made (03 to 04)  Rationale  
Sections 1;   
1.1;  2.2;  3;  
8.1.1.1; 
8.1.2;  and 
9.4.10  Deleted requirement/option to collect platelets from entire 
protocol.  Specimens for platelets shall no longer be collected.  Study team (chairs/PIs) 
determined this was not an 
essential part of the protocol. 
Requirement to collect platelets 
had potential to cause undue 
noncompliance issues related to 
scheduling problems, which were 
secondary to the limited stability 
of platelet samples.

 Affected 
Section(s)  Summary of Revisions Made (03 to 04)  Rationale  
Section 1 
and 5.5  Changed total randomized for entire study to 107 and total 
enrolled for entire study to 321.  Change to total enrollment 
because enrollment in part 1 of 
the study was increased.  
Sections 
1.1;  4.1; 
4.4;  
8.1.1.1; 
8.1.2;  8.2;  
9.4.7;  Noted that weeks 20, 24, and 28 are visits 7, 8, and 9, 
respectively.  Cont ingency response: clarified to 
match informed consent.  
Sections 
1.1;  6.4;   
8.1.1;  
8.1.1.1;     Changed weekly calls to “at least weekly.”  This will allow sites to be able to 
have additional contact and send 
additional reminders to 
participants.  
Sections 
1.1;  8.1.1;  
8.1.1.1;  
and  8.1.2  Clarified what was optional with regard to venipuncture and 
collection of blood for inflammatory markers.  Collection of 
blood for inflammatory markers is not optional if blood 
obtained by venipuncture.  Method o f blood collection 
(venipuncture vs fingerstick) is, however, optional for most 
visits.  Contingency response: 
clarification.  
Section 4.1  Changed number of participants to be enrolled in part I to 150.  This is to match the 3:1 ratio used 
to estimate 
enrol lment:randomization for part 
II of the study  
Section 
8.1.1.1  Added requirement for source documentation of participants’ 
choice of venipuncture or fingerstick for each visit.  Ensure adequate documentation 
of study conduct.  
Section 
8.1.2.  Changed statement  FROM “25(OH) vitamin D level by liquid 
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (specimen 
collection per laboratory manual) to be done at Baseline and 
study Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6 and optionally at Follow -up and 
between Week 1 and 3 if the participant volunteers for this. .” 
TO 25(OH) vitamin D level by liquid chromatography/tandem 
mass spectrometry (specimen collection per laboratory 
manual) to be done at Baseline (visit 2) and study Visits  3, 4, 
5, and 6 as well as Follow -up (visits 7, 8, and 9). T here is an 
optional visit between Week 1 and 3, if the participant 
volunteers for this . Corrected internal inconsistency.  
Vitamin D central laboratory 
assays are required for all visits 2 
through 9, inclusive.

Section 1.1.  
Schedule of 
Activities  In footnote “b” changed “an unplanned study termination visit 
occurs” to “the participant is asked to stop taking vitamin D 
and terminates from the study.”   Clarification.  
Section 4.4  Changed “day 196 ±3” to “day 196 ±7.”  Simple correction for internal 
consistency.  
Section 
6.2.2 .  Specified that the loading doses  would not be sent home with 
participants ; added that loading doses will be given to

2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Obesity and asthma are epidemic in the United States. Low vitamin D levels have been 
recognized as a common denominator in both inflammatory diseases , making vitamin D 
supplementation a potential low cost, readily available way to ameliorate the shared 
inflammatory aberration in these 2 conditions. A premise of the current study is that 
raising low 25( OH)D levels to greater than or equal to 40 ng/m l will achieve 
immunomodulatory effects beneficial to asthma control among children who are obese. 
Optimal dosing to achieve levels  greater than or equal to 40  ng/m l is not known, and 
there is no recommended dose for vitamin D supplementation in this population that will 
reliably achieve a serum 25(OH)D level sufficient to affect inflammation.  
This PK study is being conducted in a population of children with obesity and asthma to 
obtain dosing and safety  data to inform the design of a future  intervention al trial. Since 
the intervention trial will be performed in children with obesity -related asthma , it is

D are considerably more complex than a standard pharmacological agent because of 
the required stepwise hydroxylation into the active form, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and the presence 
of vitamin D and its metabolites in the circulation and tissues . Vitamin D’s  binding to the 
vitamin D- binding protein influences the properties of vitamin D metabolites.( 1) In fact, 
data from large community -based health maintenance programs predic t that 
supplemental vitamin D intake for individuals  who are obese should be 2 to 3 times 
higher than for those of normal weight .(2) Therefore, it is imperative that the PK of 
vitamin D supplementation in the target population of  children with asthma and obesity 
be well -studied prior to the design of any intervention study in this population.  
There are confounding variables between asthma, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency. 
We believe studying a group with all 3 variables is important to achieve our goal of 
determining the most appropriate dose for a randomized, controlled intervention trial at 
a later date. Children who are overweight/obese represent  an understudied population 
in asthma treatment and the data obtained thr ough this trial will contribute to the 
network’s future studies and to other pediatric studies involving lipophilic compounds.  
The IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) is part of the Environmental 
Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO ) program with a focus on the ECHO 
priority areas: upper and lower airway disease; pediatric obesity; neurodevelopment; 
and pre- , peri -, and post -natal outcomes. Its purpose is to provide an opportunity for 
children in IDeA states to participate in clinica l trials and to build clinical trial research 
capacity in the IDeA states. The ISPCTN is perfectly suited for this study given the 
prevalence of both asthma and obesity in rural areas ( Figure  2) and the inclusion of 
both of these issues in the ECHO portfolio. ISPTCN sites have developed a close 
working relationship with each other and with the central coordinating center. This PK 
study is ideal as a “fir st in network” trial to build capacity, experience, and to help the 
coordinating center gain experience running a multi -center trial. It will inform us as to the 
ability of this network to recruit participant s into future PK and intervention trials.

2.2 BACKGROUND  
Asthma is one of the most common chronic illnesses in childhood and a major cause of 
hospitalization.  The incidence and prevalence of asthma have increased since 2000.( 3) 
The disease burden of asthma in children includes missed school days, parental work 
absence, limitation of activities of daily living, Emergency Department  (ED) visits, and 
hospitalizations.  
Similarly, obesity is a burgeoning problem throughout the United States,  particularly in 
rural areas. (4) There is a growing body of literature regarding the effect that obesity has 
on asthma control. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report 39% of 
adults with asthma in the United States are obese.( 5) There are several aspects of 
obesity that contribute to more severe asthma symptoms including mass loading on the 
chest wall, airway stiffness, and inflammat ion. Childhood obesity -related asthma likely 
differs from adult -onset obesity -related asthma in that the pro- inflammatory nature of 
adipose tissue may be more critical for children.( 6, 7, 8) Supporting this , a study in 
young children with asthma and obesit y suggested that obese children are more 
responsive to inhaled corticosteroid therapy than their adult coun terparts .(9) 
Vitamin D plays a role in modulating inflammation, and deficiency of this pro -hormone 
may exacerbate poor asthma control. V itamin D insufficiency/deficiency is common in 
children who are overweight or obese ( 10) and studies have suggested a relationship

Date: 14 December 2020                                                                                                     Page 22 of 89  between low serum 25(OH)D and asthma symptoms.( 11, 12) It is possible that vitamin 
D supplementation could improve asthma control  through its anti -inflammatory 
mechanisms . A Cochrane review published in 2016 supported this assertion, although 
noted that better studies, particularly in subpopulations, were needed.( 13) A 
meta -analysis of studies in children showed a trend toward fewer  asthma exacerbations 
in children given relatively small amounts of supplemental vitamin D.( 14) Greater 
supplementation, which is considered to be very safe, may have even more salubrious 
effects.  
The conversion of vitamin D3 to 25(OH)D has been well studi ed. (15) It is  noted that the 
vitamin D- 25-hydroxylase operates well below its V max in most individuals due to a lack 
of substrate. The V max of the conversion of D3 to 25(OH)D occurs when the 2 are in 
equimolar concentrations, which occurs with a 25(OH)D level of approximately 
40 ng/ml . Unfortunately, as the authors  state, “…it is very difficult and costly to measure 
circulating vitamin D3 and relate it to circulating 25(OH)D. ” As D3 will not be measured, 
the conversion of D3 to 25(OH)D will be considered with absorption of D3 and 
incorporated in the model as extravascular input for 25(OH)D . This approach has been 
used in a previously developed model for vitamin D by Foissac et al. (16) 
The level of 25(OH)D needed to ameliorate asthma symptoms is not known, but is 
believed to be greater than that recommended for bone health , 30 ng/ml. It has been 
suggested that a level of approximately 40 ng/ml is necessary to achieve anti -infective 
and anti -inflammatory activity in cells critical to asthma control.( 17, 18) It i s unknown 
how much vitamin D (as vitamin D3) should be given to  children who are 
overweight/obese to attain a level of greater than or equal to 40  ng/ml. It is likely a much 
larger dose is needed given the large volume of distribution that excess adipose tissue 
poses  (a potential vitamin D sink ). A study that combines PK modeling with exploratory 
asthma and inflammatory mediator endpoints is of particular interest given the 
uncertainty regarding an appropriate dose of vitamin D necessary to achieve adequat e 
serum levels of 25(OH)D  and the need to verify that reaching a level greater than or 
equal to 40 ng/ml will in fact lead to decreased inflammation . We propose this study to 
determine an appropriate regimen for vitamin D supplementation to achieve consist ent 
serum 25(OH)D levels greater than or equal to 40  ng/m l, and w e will explore its effect 
on markers of inflammation  and asthma control . 
Obesity Worsens Asthma Severity in Children  
Uncontrolled asthma is a major public health problem . Each year asthma is a leading 
cause of ED visits, hospitalization,  and missed school for children. Obesity in children 
increases the risk for the development of asthma ,(19, 20) through unknown means . 
Although there are many mechanical reasons why obesity may  cause a predispos ition 
to asthma- like symptoms, it is probable that the pro- inflammatory nature of excess 
adipose tissue is a predisposing factor .(6, 21) A recent Expert Panel proposed that 
obesity -mediated metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation contributes to the 
pathogenesis of asthma.( 7) Specifically, analysis of data from over 17,000 children 
demonstrated a link between asthma, body mass index, and dyslipidemia.( 22) Obesity 
is associated with elevated levels of circulating adipokines and cytokines, including 
leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α), and numerous interleukins  (ILs), all of which

levels were found to be elevated in asthmatic children who were obese and higher leptin 
levels were associated with worse airflow through peripheral airways.( 24) Sever al 
studies have demonstrated that obesity in children is associated with worse asthma 
symptom control, reduced lung function, and  greater health care utilization.( 25, 26, 27). 
Thus, improved asthma control in this high- morbidity group is a leading public health 
need.  
Vitamin D Levels are Lower in Obese Children and Are Associated With Worse 
Asthma Symptoms  
Correcting low vitamin D levels may be critically important for improving asthma control  
in children who are obese.  Low vitamin D levels are associated both with obesity in 
children and with difficult -to-treat asthma .(10,12) Turer, et al . observed that 79% of 
overweight  children (BMI 85th%-95th%) and 86% of obese  children  (BMI greater than or 
equal to 95th percentile) met the diagnosis of vitamin D insufficiency ( less than 
30 ng/ml).(10) In addition, low 25(OH)D levels are associated with increased markers of 
oxidative stress and inflammation in children who are severely obese.( 28) Vitamin D 
has been demonstrated to down- regulate production of pro- inflammatory cytokines such 
as TNFα and IL -6 and inhibit NFĸB activation,( 29) processes important to asthma 
control . Polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor that decrease vitamin D action have 
been associated with the presence of asthma in child ren and adult s.(30) Decreased 
platelet counts have been noted anecdotally in those increasing their vitamin D 
consumption (Scott Weiss, personal communication) and platelets play an important 
role in recruiting effector cells into the lungs of people with asthma .( 31) 
Children With Asthma Have Lower Vitamin D Levels 
Low vitamin D levels are found in children with asthma irrespective of body weight. 
There is an association between low vitamin D levels and obesity in childhood. 
However, even children who are not obese but have asthma are at increased risk of 
having low serum 25(OH)D levels. In the Childhood Asthma Management Program 
(CAMP) vitamin D levels were obtained on 1,024 children aged 5 to 12 years who were 
known to have asthma. Thirty -five percent of these children were vitamin D insufficient 
(less than 30  ng/ml).( 12) A nationwide study using National Health and Nutrition 
Examination S urvey (NHANES) data saw a positive correlation between vitamin D 
insufficiency defined as serum 25(OH)D level less than 30 ng/ml and current asthma or 
current wheeze in children.( 32) An examination of data from the Childhood Asthma 
Study from Australia found that 25(OH)D deficiency (less than 20 ng/ml) early in 
childhood is associated with an increased risk for persistent asthma.( 33) Th ese lower 
levels may be due to increase exposure to oral and inhaled corticosteroids used to treat 
asthma, decreased sun exposure due to exercise induced symptoms limiting outdoor 
activities, or a primary effect of asthma on vitamin D metabolism.( 34) It will be 
important, therefore, to evaluate the relationship between asthma, obesity, and vitamin 
D pharmacokinetics as a whole si nce the target population for an intervention trial will 
be  children who have both asthma and weight -related issues. .

including asthma. (35) (Figure  3) Several  high quality controlled trials have shown that 
low vitamin D levels place asthmatic children at high risk for severe 
exacerbations .(12, 36) Gupta and collaborators found lower vitamin D levels in children 
who had difficult -to-treat asthma or poor asthma control, (37) and vitamin D deficiency  
has been  associated with low er pulmonary function in obese children.( 38) 
In a longitudinal study, Hollams and colleagues  found that the number of times a child 
was found to be deficient in vitamin D (defined as a level of less than 20 ng/ml) was 
positively associat ed with the risk for asthma and wheezing at 10 years of age, 
suggesting that low vitamin D is instrumental in the inception of asthma.( 33) In addition, 
several studies have concluded that higher 25(OH)D levels appear to protect against 
respiratory infections, a key trigger for asthma exacerbations.( 39, 40)

The Optimal 25(OH)D Level for Treating Asthma  
Obesity among adults with asthma is associated with more severe symptoms and a 
reduced response to conventional anti -inflammatory asthma treatments. The Endocrine 
Society states that vitamin D deficiency occurs at levels less than 20 ng/m l and vitamin 
D insufficiency is present when levels are 21 to 29 ng/m l. (59) Vitamin D insufficiency 
and deficiency are generally defined in terms of calcium metabolism and bone health. 
Non-calcemic effects of vitamin D are well known, but the Endocrine Society does not 
recommend specific levels to achieve effects outside of bone health and fall prevention. 
The precise level one needs to achieve to have an effect on infectio n and inflammation

40 ng/m l.(33, 29) 
The anti -infective and anti -inflammatory effects of vitamin D appear to occur when 
serum levels are high enough to achieve adequate cellular levels of 1,25 hydroxy -
vitamin D3 (1,25D3) . The expression of many genes in inflammatory cells including 
macrophages, dendritic cells, T helper cells, and B cells  is regulated by 1,25D3 through 
the vitamin D receptor . Despite levels of 25(OH)D greater than 30 ng/ml being adequate 
for bone health, higher levels may be necessary to achieve maximal extra -orthopedic 
vitamin D effects . Hollis, et al. showed that optimal conversion of vitamin D3 to 25(OH)D 
occurs when serum levels of 25(OH)D are greater than or equal to 40  ng/m l.(15) 
Further, Ginde et al. review ed NHANES 2003  to 2006 data  and found that optimal 
vitamin D status, defined by estimated maximum parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
suppression, does not occur until 25(OH)D levels are greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml. 
(41) This s tudy included nearly  6000 children between 6 and 19  years old. In a 
prospective study, Sabetta et al. ( 40) found that maintaining a serum 25(OH)D level 
above 38  ng/m l could reduce the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections in adults . 
Another study found that pre- eclampsia did not occur in women who had 25(OH)D 
levels greater than 37 ng/m l early in pregnancy.( 42) These studies imply that higher 
levels of 25(OH)D are necessary to achieve the desired effects  beyond bone health.  
Indeed, a small number of asthma studies support this target. In the Childhood Asthma 
Management Program (CAMP) study, the risk of exacerbations was inversely 
associated with 25(OH)D with the lowest risk seen with levels greater than or equal to 
40 ng/m l.(12) Similarly, the large Vitamin D Add- on Therapy Enhances Corticosteroid 
Responsiveness in Asthma (VIDA) study reported trends toward improved asthma 
control in a population of adults who achieved a mean 25(OH)D level of 41.9  ng/m l at 
12 weeks of treatment.( 43) The 95% confidence interval around this mean was quite 
small, implying that benefit begins to be seen at this level. Some  studies of 
supplementation of vitamin D have not shown a positive effect on asthma control; 
however, serum  25(OH)D levels greater than or equal to 40 ng/m l were not achieved 
routinely . Due to these uncertain findings, a 2016 Cochrane review of vitamin D 
supplementation in asthma noted that the optimum circulating level i s as yet 
undetermined.( 13) They note that there is a need for primary trials in under -represented 
populations to determine this goal. We hope to fill this  knowledge gap by aiming to 
achieve a level that will provide s upporting evidence for anti -inflammatory benefits at an 
appropriate serum level.  
Vitamin D Trials in Children with Asthma Are Few but Encouraging 
Few controlled trials involving vitamin D supplementation have been conducted in 
children with asthma . Those that have been done have been small but encouraging . A 
recent meta- analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials in children found that 
supplementation is likely to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations .(14) The analysis 
included 8 randomized trials of  greater than 570  childre n treated for 1 to 12 months with 
a dose that ranged from  1000  IU per day to 60,000 IU per month. The authors  
concluded that children receiving vitamin D had reduced odds of exacerbation

noted that few children achiev ed a serum 25(OH)D level of greater than or equal to 
40 ng/m l, and serum levels were not reported for most  studies . None of the trials were 
designed to achieve a target 25(OH)D level greater than or equal to 40 mg/ml . 
A similar meta -analysis was performed in adults taking vitamin D supplement ation  and 
showed a significa nt reduction in asthma attacks requiring ED visits  in those 
supplemented.( 44) Again, serum levels greater than or equal to 40  ng/ml were not 
necessarily reached. Kerley and colleagues evaluat ed 17 intervention trials of vitamin D 
supplement ation  involving 1578 asthmatic adults and children.( 45) Study size, vitamin D 
dose, age of participants, and study lengths differed, making comparisons  among these 
17 trials  difficult . Results were generally supportive of supplementation, including 
decreased exacerbations in newly diagnosed children (46) and decreased airway 
eosinophilia.( 47) The Cochrane review of 7 trials involving 435 children and 2 trials of 
658 adults concluded that improved vitamin D levels reduced the risk of asthma 
exacerbations; however, v itamin D supplementation had no effect on lung function as 
assessed by  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second. (13) Spirometry does not appear to 
be an important endpoint for a vitamin D -asthma study.  
Determining Optimal Supplemental Dose Needed to Achieve 25(OH)D Levels 
Above 40 ng/m l 
Scott Weiss and Aug usto Litonjua have studied the asthma- vitamin D link extensively. 
As they state,  “The biology of vitamin D is complex…we feel there is much more to 
uncover, such as the dose and timing of supplementation and the level that maximizes 
protection.”( 18) 
We have examined previous studies of vitamin D supplementation in adults and children 
in order to try to determine the best way to achieve adequate serum 25(OH)D levels in 
children who are overweight or obese. Two months of treatment with vitamin D  at a 
dose of 5000 IU daily increased mean 25(OH)D  levels  from 15 to 40  ng/m l in a small 
study of children  who were obese  (n=14). (48) 
A vitamin D3  supplementation trial of 4000 IU daily for 6 months was conducted in 
adolescents  with diabetes  and obesity .(49) After 3 months, levels increased from an 
average of 19  ng/m l to roughly 35 ng/ml (mean increase at 3 and 6 months was 
15 ng/ml and 19.5  ng/m l, respectively) . Treatment was well  tolerated. Importantly, this 
study did not include a loading dose, yet yielded a substantial increase in 25(OH)D in 
just 3 months in adolescents  who were obese. Maximum levels were not achieved until 
6 months, consistent w ith the long half -life of vitamin D.  
A loading dose is the amount of drug designed to fill the central volume of distribution 
for a drug to a concentration that matches the final plateau concentration achieved with 
the maintenance dose.( 50) Loading doses ar e used in order to achieve this final plateau 
sooner than the four half -lives required if the drug is simply administered at the 
maintenance dose rate .(51) The functional half -life for vitamin D3 is extrem ely long and 
ranges from 2 to 3  months  (52, 53) or longer  (54), largely due to the lipophilic nature of 
the drug and its distribution into adipose tissue. The clinical effect of this long

5 half -lives to reach steady -state conditions . Thus, achieving target concentrations 
through a loading dose strategy should allow individuals to achieve target 
concentrations more quickly ( 51) and have a more rapid therapeutic effect.  
Limited studies have examined the benefit of a loading dose of vitamin D on obtaining 
the desired 25(OH)D concentration. (50) Luger examined 2 dose regimens in adults with 
morb id obesity following gastric by -pass surgery; a loading dose (up to 300,000 IU over 
4 weeks, divided into 3 doses) achieved the desired vitamin D concentration more 
rapidly than the standard regimen. Radhakishun examined weekly vitamin D treatment 
with 25,000  IU in 109 multi -ethnic obese children, 8 to 18 years of age, with vitamin D 
insufficiency/deficiency .(55) In 84.4% of the children, the vitamin D status improved 
from deficiency ( less than 20  ng/m l) to insufficiency/ sufficiency ( greater than or equal to 
20 ng/m l). No side effects were reported, and the highest level reached was far below 
the threshold for toxicity. (55) Van Groningen evaluated 3  loading dose strategies in 208 
vitamin D deficient adults (ages 18- 77 years) . This study found that greater responses 
in vitamin D status were observed as a function of increasing loading dose. (56) A study 
by Alansari, et al . gave 6 to 14 year -olds 600,000 IU by intramuscular injection as a 
loading dose followed by just 400  IU daily.( 57) Participants who received the loading 
dose demonstrated a 7  ng/m l greater increase i n 25(OH)D than participants who did not 
receive the loading dose.  
In the VIDA trial, a large -scale vitamin D supplementation trial in mainly 
overweight/obese adults with asthma and vitamin D deficiency  (mean BMI = 30, mean 
25(OH)D less than 20  ng/ml), participants received a single oral vitamin D3 loading 
dose of 100,000 IU and 4000  IU daily . This resulted in a mean 25(OH)D level of 
41.9 ng/m l at 12 weeks  (43), highlighting the benefit of a large loading dose in this 
population.  
Of concern is that most of these studies did not achieve a level over the presumed 
threshold of 40 ng/ml needed to achieve an anti -inflammatory effect in a majority of their 
participants.  Discussion s with endocrinologists, pulmonologists caring for patients with 
cystic fibrosis, and colleagues in Lipid and Weight Management clinics have raise d 
concerns about achieving our desired goal even with doses similar to those used above.  
It is likely that even higher doses will be needed to achieve a level  greater than or equal 
to 40 ng/ml in a large proportion (75%) of participants  who have large lipid stores . To 
obviate this concern, we will use a dose approximating that used by Benechia, et al ( 49) 
and a higher  dose of 10,000 IU/day . The use of a loading dose in 2 groups and the lack 
of such a dose in another treatment group and the standard of care group will allow PK 
modeling to determine an optimal dose to get 25(OH)D levels greater than or equal to 
40 ng/ ml consistently.

It is the intention of this study to serve as a dose finding study for a large, randomized, 
controlled intervention trial in overweight/obese children with asthma in the future.  
It is self -evident that to determi ne the best dose of vitamin D to use in a study of 
children who are obese and have asthma, we should study the PK of vitamin D in 
children who are obese and have asthma.  
There are several reasons that children with both asthma and obesity  should be 
included in this study:  
1. Children with asthma and obesity  may differ in vitamin D status and response to 
supplementation compared to children who are only obese.  
2. Most  children with persistent asthma symptoms are currently treated with inhaled 
corticosteroids.  Both inhaled and oral cortico steroids can a ffect vitamin D levels.( 34) 
3. Previous studies of vitamin D levels in non- obese children with asthma have 
demonstrated the presence of low levels  of 25(OH)D  in many, which raises the 
possibility of direct asthma- vitamin D metabolism interactions.  
4. Children with asthma may spend more time inside and have decreased exposure to 
sunlight due to exercise- induced ast hma symptoms . 
5. In contrast to children with asthma , where there is at least a theoretical benefit to 
high vitamin D levels , there is no evidence to support the need for 25(OH)D levels 
greater than equal to 40 ng/ml in children  who are obese and do not have asthma. 
Exposing children with no potential for benefit to higher doses of vitamin D raises 
ethical concerns.  
6. Including children with asthma allows for collection of preliminary data on the effect 
of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory markers in a group of children 
suffering from an inflammatory disease.  
7. Including children with asthma in the PK study is important to help develop research 
capacity in this nascent network. By asking sites to collect diary cards and 
administer the ACT and record resul ts on case report forms  (CRFs)  we will build 
infrastructure and test feasibility for a more sophisticated and intricate asthma study 
at a later date.  
8. Review of the literature reveals that there are few data available on the effects of 
vitamin D administra tion in specific patient groups, such as obese children with 
asthma.   
We believe this PK pilot study will be most applicable to our final target population if it 
includes children with both asthma and obesity.

Ekawaru evaluated 17,614 patients receiving vitamin D and characterized the resulting 
vitamin D concentrations. (2) The relationship between dose and 25(OH )D appeared to 
be a non- linear, exponential curve, whereby  dose adjustments increas ed vitamin D 
concentrations to a point, at which levels began to plateau. BMI, rather than absolute 
body weight, was found to be the better determinant of the 25(OH)D level . Obese and 
overweight participants had serum 25(OH)D levels that were 8 ng/ml and 3.2  ng/ml 
lower, respectively (p<0.001), than normal weight participants . Due to the long  half-life 
of 25(OH)D  a minimum of 3 months of daily administration is required to att ain steady -
state concentrations of 25(OH)D. (58) 
Safety of Vitamin D S upplementation  
Vitamin D supplementation is extremely safe. (2) Accepted normal serum  values for 
25(OH)D levels range widely . Some expert groups feel that values less than 30  ng/ml 
are abnormal, whereas others feel that 20 ng/ml is the lower limit of normal. The upper 
bound of normal serum 25(OH)D  in most laboratories  is 100  ng/ml, however toxicity is 
unlikely to occur at levels less than 150 ng/ml.(59) No published supplementation trials 
to our knowledge (including those with loading and daily doses far exceeding our 
proposed dosing) have experienced levels exceeding this safe level . Numerous 
published trials have demonstrated that the doses we will evaluate are well within a safe 
dosing range. Recent published dosing regimens inc luding 4000 IU daily for 6 months 
(49) and repeated 600,000 IU intramuscular loading doses every 3 months over a 
6 month period were well  tolerated with no untoward effects. (57) Young adults with 
vitamin  D def iciency have been treated with 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks and then 
continued on 50,000 IU every other week for up to 6 years without serious side effects 
or changes in serum calcium levels. (60) Doses as high as 55,000  IU daily have been 
administered to obese adults without causing hypercalcemia, (2) and loading doses of 
200,000  IU administered to normal weight adults were not associated with 
hypercalcemia. (51) Celedon and colleagues are currently conducting an NIH -funded 
trial in 4 to 12- year-olds ( 61) giving 4000 IU daily for 48  weeks . From personal 
communication with the study team, we understand there have been no SAEs . 
Some drugs interfere with vitamin D absorption or metabolism. (62) These include 
glucocorticoids, some anti -epileptics, orlistat , and cholestyramine,  which have been 
shown to lower 25(OH)D levels . There is a theoretical concern for hypercalcemia when 
vitamin  D is taken with thiazide diuretics and supplemental calcium . Only 3 such cases 
of hypercalcemia have been reported . These reports were from 2 studies, both involving 
elderly patients, and the cases of hypercalcemia were mild  and reversible. (63) 
Evaluation of Inflammatory Mediators  
Obesity is a pro- inflammatory state characterized by increased circulating levels of 
adipokines including leptin.  It is postulated that the inflammation caused by increased 
leptin is a contributing factor to the asthma- obesity dyad in children. It will be useful to 
examine the anti -inflammatory effects of vitamin D on certain biomarkers. Leptin

lymphocytes.( 64) In a study of adults, TNF -α, IL-6, and leptin levels were higher in 
obese asthma patients compared to non- obese asthma patients. (65) IL-17 is another 
proinflammatory mediator that regulates tissue inflammation in asthma. (66) Its activity 
can be inhibited by vitamin D. (67) 
Conversely, IL- 10 is an anti -inflammatory cytokine. I n a mouse model of allergic 
asthma, 1,25 vitamin D3 has been shown to induce IL- 10 release and enhance the 
effect of immunotherapy. (68) 
Examining the effect of vitamin D on leptin plus IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α (cytokine 
panel)  will help assess its anti -inflammatory role in obesity -related asthma. This will be 
important to support the benefit of achieving a high level of vitamin D (greater than or 
equal to 40 ng/ml) in an intervention trial.  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT   
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
Compared to most medications, t here are few risks to vitamin D s upplements . No 
adverse reactions are listed in the manufacturer’s labeling  (69). Levels  greater than 
100 ng/ml have been well tolerated without significant side effects. (70) The Endocrine 
Society’s practice guidelines on vitamin D state that vitamin D intoxication is usually not 
observed unt il serum 25(OH)D levels are  greater than 150 ng/ml.(59) Vitamin  D 
intoxication associated with hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and suppressed 
parathyroid hormone level may occur , but is typically only seen in patients who are 
receiving massive doses  of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 1 million  IU per day  for several months 
to years ).(70) Symptoms of vitamin D intoxication may  include nausea, vomiting, loss of 
appetite, constipation, dehydration, fatigue, irritability, confusion, weakness , and/or 
weight loss (69). Hypersensitivity reactions to vitamin D supplementation are rare but 
possible. Vitamin D3 is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and may cause drug interactions , 
although this is considered very rar e. 
Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety of vitamin D supplementation in 
pregnancy . Hollis et al.  showed that giving pregnant women 4,000 IU/day was safe  (71), 
and another study demonstrated the safety of a single dose of 70,000 IU in pregnant 
women. (72) In fact, several studies have explicitly looked for the potential benefit of 
vitamin D supplementation to the mother and fetus and found no harms .(73, 74, 75) 
However,  we will not enroll pregnant women in this study and will ask all females of 
child-bearing potential to utilize some form of birth control  (abstinence qualif ies). 
Risks of blood draws are minimal and include fainting, bruising, and mild pain. There 
are small risks to blood sampling, such as  pain/discomfort due to the collection process 
or blood loss . Local pressure will be applied at blood drawing sites to minimize the risk 
of bruising, and participants who become light -headed will be placed in a supine

blood collection in pediatric participants. These amounts will be even lower if 
microtainer collection of fingerstick samples is used  and participants  opt out of optional 
measures – the minimum  required  amount of blood drawn per participant over the 
complete course of the study  is approximately 23.6 m l.  
Protocol elements to mitigate risk include the exclusion of participants  with known 
hypercalcemia, kidney stones, significant renal or parathyroid disease, and/ or known 
diseases complicated by elevated 25(OH)D levels , including sarcoidosis, William 
Syndrom e, and granulomatous diseases . Kidney stones are a known complication of 
hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria. Spot urine calcium/creatinine ratios will be monitored,  
and serum calcium levels will be obtained in any participant  with elevated urine 
calcium /creat inine ratios .  
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Participant Impact  
Because inclusion criteria include a serum 25(OH)D less than  30 ng/ml —a level 
considered to be vitamin D insufficient  (59) — participating in this study may increase a 
participant’s serum 25(OH)D into the normal range,  which  potentially  could improve 
bone health. The comparator group will be provided the Institute of Medicine’s 
recommended daily allowance of vitamin D –  600 IU/day .(76) Prior research has shown 
a trend toward improved asthma control or fewer symptoms in children who have higher 
levels of vitamin D. It is possible that children in this study may experience fewer and 
less severe asthma exacerbations with increased serum 25(OH)D levels ; however, this 
cannot be guaranteed. The participant s may learn basic information about nutrition and 
asthma by taking part  in this study , potentially resulting in additional  health benefits . 
Public Health Impact  
Both asthma and obesity are major public health problems , each contribut ing 
significantly to the burden on healthcare systems, patients, and families . Asthma and 
obesity are partic ularly prevalent in lower socioeconomic, underserved populations . The 
Center s for Disease Control and Prev ention reports that up to 39% of individuals wit h 
asthma are obese, giving a co morbid condition of obesity -related asthma . Notably, 
obesity is more common  in rural areas than in urban areas  according to the US  
Department of Health and Human Services. (77) Vitamin D is an inexpensive nutritional 
supplement . A low-cost, readily available intervention that could decrease the burden of 
asthma in the obese  asthma pediatric population could have major public health 
implications . Although speculative at this time , the proposed intervention has the 
capacity to improve public health in  an underserved population  with little expense if the 
correct dose can be determined and shown to be beneficial .

All participants randomiz ed will hav e vitamin D insufficiency and participation in  this 
study will lead to appropriate supplementation . Benefits may be  related to improved 
25(OH)D level effects on b one health with a potential for a positive effect on asthma 
control . Risks of blood  draws are minimal and not outside those encountered in daily 
living . We will provide the option for fingerstick collection of small volumes of blood for 
vitamin D level determination in order to lessen the anxiety of venipuncture in children. 
Risks will be mitigated by implementation of inclusion and exclusion criteria that  
decrease the chance of any hypercalcemia- associated problems and by monitoring  
urine calcium/creatinine ratios.

Participant Enrollment  and Randomization 
There will be enrollment at ISPCTN sites with the goal of enrolling up to 150  participants 
and randomizing up to 50 for Part 1 and enrolling  up to 171 participants  and 
randomizing up to 63 participants for Part 2 . During the interim analysis, enrollment 
continued , which explains the 50  participants randomized in Part 1.  
Study Timeline  
We anticipate d initiating enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Actual enrollment 
started in January 2019.  
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR S TUDY DESIGN  
Low serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with both asthma and obesity in children. 
Obesity is associated with greater asthma severity. A premise of the current study is 
that raising l ow 25( OH)D levels to greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml will achieve 
immunomodulatory effects beneficial to asthma control among obese children . The 
optimal dosing strategy of vitamin D for obese and overweight adolescents with asthma 
and vitamin D insuffic iency is unknown. Identifying the appropriate dosing regimen for 
this population lays the foundati on for future efficacy trials , which may be of great public 
health benefit . 
The nonlinear PK of vitamin D3 has been  reported in adults , but it is not well stu died in 
children. The multi -level dosing strategy in this study will result in sufficient PK data to 
better characterize the dose- response relationship of 25(OH)D after vitamin D3 
administration . The PK data will be used to model vitamin D dosing regimens that 
would, based upon the disposition characteristics of the compound, produce a degree of 
systemic exposure sufficient to produce plasma 25(OH)D concentrations  greater than or 
equal to 40 ng/ml (the putative therapeutic target concentration).

Based on published data involving children with obesity, the optimal dosing regimen to 
achieve serum levels greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml will likely be within the range of 
doses of vitamin D3 evaluated in Part 1.  Based on PK models of vitamin D in adults, the 
increase in 25(OH)D after vitamin D3 dosing is not linear, but is influenced by the 
baseline value. A study in obese adults with vitamin D deficiency reported that mean 
(SD) mea sured increments in 25(OH)D at Week  21 were 12.4 (9.7) ng/ ml, 27.8 (10.2) 
ng/ml, and 48.1 (19.6) ng/ ml following vitamin D3 treatment at 1000 IU/day, 
5000 IU/day, and 10,000  IU/day, respectively . Assuming a median baseline of 
~20 ng/ml, 5000 IU/day would lead to greater than 50% of participants with 25(OH)D 
greater than or equal to 40  ng/ml and 10,000 IU/day would lead to greater than 75% 
participants with 25(OH)D  greater than or equal to 40  ng/ml after 21 weeks . To ensure 
the appropriate exposure of vitamin D in obese children with asthma and in anticipation 
of a future intervention study, the present study will examine the effect of a loading dose 
regimen, followed by daily dosing . 
Belenchia et al. found that  giving  obese adolescents with diabetes 4000 IU/day vitamin 
D3 led to a mean increase in serum 25(OH)D of 19.5  ng/ml at 6 months .(49) That study 
did not use a loading dose. Assuming our cohort has a similar mean baseline 25(OH)D 
concentration, we anticipate that we will need more than 4000  IU/day to get 75% of 
participants above the desired goal of 25(OH)D level of greater than or equal to 
40 ng/ml. This is also supported by a study in obese children with vitamin D deficiency, 
which reported a mean serum 25(OH)D increasing from 15 to 40 ng/ml after 
5000 IU/day orally for just 2 month s (48). Our gro up of children, which will include some 
participants greater than 99th% BMI for age and sex, may require even greater amounts 
of vitamin D3.  
Vitamin D dosing arms for a PK study  
We e xplore d 3 dosing arms and a S oC arm in Part 1 of this PK trial. Nutrient studies 
cannot have a true placebo arm since all participant s are exposed to some level of 
vitamin D. A n SoC arm has been included to allow for evaluation of changes in 
25(OH)D over 16 weeks in a population of participants who are not exposed to high 
levels of vitamin D. A placebo arm is not appropriate because it is unethical to identify a 
treatable metabolic deficiency and not intervene.( 78) Although the Endocrine Society 
recommends higher doses for replenishment, the Institute of Medicine recommends 
600 IU/day for vitamin D supplementation as SoC .(76) We use d this for the comparator 
group. Given that it is a log -order less than the lowest dose in our treatment arm , it 
should still act as a reasonable control group. This low dose supplementation also 
enriched the PK modeling.

Part 1:  
• Cohort 1: Single 50,000 IU loading dose + 6, 000 IU daily dose  
• Cohort 2: Single 50,000 IU loading dose + 10,000 IU daily dose 
• Cohort 3: no loading dose + 6,000 IU daily dose  
• Cohort 4: no loading dose + 600 IU daily dose (S oC) 
We perform ed interim analysis when a minimum of 4 participants in each group had  
completed 16 weeks of therapy and had a 20- week serum level drawn. Participants 
continued  to be randomi zed to one of these 4 groups while the analysis t ook place. 
Their data will be collected and utilized in the end- of-study PK modeling.  
Following the interim analysis (see statistical methods below) , we determined  the dose 
most likely to achieve the Part 2  endpoint of greater than  75% of participants achieving 
a serum 25(OH)D level greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml. The selection w as based on 
the interim PK analysis as well as safety and tolerability data. This dose is not  any of the 
pre-determined arms used in Part 1.  
The DCOC submitted data from Part 1 to the pharmacokinetic analysis team at Duke in 
November 2019.  Based on the PK data, the VDORA1 study team proposed that the 
dosing regimen that consisted of a single 50,000 IU loading dose + 8,000 IU daily dose 
be used for part 2.  The ECHO ISPCTN Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) met 
on February 13, 2020,  to review the recommended dose along with a data report 
prepared by the DCOC.  The DSMB approved of the recommended dose.  
We will continue to recruit into the S oC arm.  These SoC participant s will serve as a 
control/comparator group to help us understand the effect of latitude, seas on, ethnicity, 
diet, and skin tone on vitamin D metabolism. This group will also be useful when 
assessing our ability to achieve serum level greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml in the 
Part 2 intervention group.  
Part 2 will randomize up to 63 additional pa rticipants into one of two 16-week regimens 
in a 2:1 ratio:  
Part 2:  
• Cohort A: Single 50,000 IU loading dose + 8,000 IU daily dose  
• Cohort B: 600 IU  daily dose (SoC) 
4.4 END OF S TUDY DEFINITION  
The end of the study will be at the completion of the study activities  of the 
63 randomized participants in Part 2 of the study . For individual participant s, the end of 
the study will be following the Week 28 (visit 9; day  196 ±7) follow -up visit , following 
participant  withdrawal of consent or when the participant has met the protocol -defined

transparent reporting to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
(CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authori ties. Individuals who do not initially meet eligibility criteria may be rescreened 
1 time at least 4 weeks later .  Participants who were terminated due to a screen fail 
must sign new consent/assent documents prior to rescreening.  Rescreened 
participants s hould be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening.

Though there are many children with both asthma and obesity, especially in the rural 
IDeA states, recruitment and retention of eligible par ticipants will be critical to study 
success. We anticipate that we will need a large number of sites involved in this trial in 
order to recruit the necessary participants. This study will recruit  (enroll)  up to  321 
participant s for a study lasting over 6 m onths. Although vitamin D supplementation is 
safe and easy to administer , there are several scheduled  blood draws and the time 
commitment and child concern about blood tests may make it difficult for a small 
number of sites to recruit enough participants. It is very feasible that a large number of 
sites can recruit a small number of participant s at each site leading to success of this 
study and success of the Network as a unit working cooperatively.  
Within a multi -center network, optimal recruitment approaches may vary from site to 
site, and network success may require sharing of best -practices between clinical sites. 
Though each clinical site is responsible for recruiting, enrolling , and  retaining study 
participants, the Data Coordinating and Operati ons Center  (DCOC)  will assist each site 
in creating a site- specific recruitment and retention plan.  The DCOC has a Recruitment 
and Retention Plan summarizing the most common best  practices for recruitment and 
retention of pediatric and adolescent participants and will work with each site to 
establish their own customized recruitment and retention plan. Site initiation will include 
review of the individual site’s recruitment and retention plans. The trial is  registered on 
www.ClinicalTrials.gov  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .   
Recruitment  
FDA considers direct advertising (i .e., advertising intended to be seen or heard by 
prospective participants) to be part of the informed consent process as well as the 
participant -selection process. Therefore, IRB review and approval is required to ensure 
that the information is not misleading and that the ad is not coercive. Paper advertising 
products (flyers, small posters, handbills) and phone recruiting scripts will be created as 
needed by t he DCOC as templates for sites to use. This approach is commonly used 
with success by pharmaceutical companies and large clinical research organizations.  
Following approval by the central ( University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences [ UAMS ]) 
IRB, the material will be made available in template form to all sites for customization. 
Sites will be required to use the central (UAMS) IRB for this study. A site m ay customize 
recruitment  templates  and phone scripts – or create its own material - to fit its own 
community. All advertising  and scripts  must , however,  have written cIRB approval  prior 
to use.  A general description of the study, including frequently asked questions and 
consent and assent forms will be provided to potential participants prior to their  initial 
screening visit. If the potential participants are interested in attending a screening visit, 
they will meet with the study coordinator and the local physician co- investigators to 
review the study and answer questions.  
Another option for recruitment that local sites may use is a search of medical records for 
potential participants who may met the inclusion criteria.  This will be done in

privacy board as well as the IRB for this study and can grant partial HIPAA waivers to 
allow sites to use medical records.  
If a potential participant appears to meet eligibility requirements , i.e., based on pre-
screening assessment , but does not want to be in the study, the potential participant 
and/or parents/guardians will be asked why they do not want to participate.  These data 
will be recorded in a screening log without any identifiers that could link answers back to 
an individual or family. The individual/family will be told they do not have to answer any 
of the questions they do not want to answer.  
Retention  
Similar to recruitment, retention tactics should be tailored to the individual resources 
and challenges of each site These include the study being too long or burdensome, the 
participant feeling they are not benefitting from participation, unengaged or 
unenthusiastic study staff, and lack of physician involvement and attention. The study 
staff must recognize that the study participants (and caregivers) are providing a service 
to the study while undergoing risk and participants must feel appreciated.   
The target for completion  is 80% of randomized participants.  
More details about recruitment and retention processes can be found in the Recruitment 
and Retention Plan  in the Manual Operating Procedures (MOP), including  detailed 
descriptions  of best practices, strategies to be implemented,  and metrics to be 
monitored.  
5.6 CLINICAL HELP LINE  
Sites can call the VDORA1 Clinical Help Line for specific protocol questions or to speak 
with one of  the protocol PIs. The phone number can  be found in the MOP . 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION 
Participants in VDORA1 will receive oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) at a dose 
determined by the randomized assignment to 1  of 4 dosing regimens in Part 1 or 1  of 2 
dosing regimens in Part 2.  This product will be packaged and distributed to study sites 
for dispensing to the participant’s caregiver (parent or guardian).  
6.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
Once the assigned dose of vitamin D3 is determined, it will be dispensed by the site to 
the participant’s caregiver at Visit 2 (baseline) . The caregiver will be i nstructed to give 
the participant a loading dose of one 50,000  IU capsule orally on the day of the baseline

their assigned vitamin D3 dose (600, 6000,  or 10,000 I U (part 1) or 600 or  8,000 IU (part 
2)) orally each day, starting on the day after  the baseline visit  and continuing to  Visit 6 . 
Participants with no loading dose will start on their daily dose on the day of the baseline 
visit. A member of the study team  will witness and document the initial dose for each 
participant during the baseline visit. Participants will be given a dosing diary for 
recording all doses of vitamin D3 taken through the 16- week dosing phase. Missed 
doses will also be noted in the daily  diary  cards for dosing visits . 
Following the interim analysis, an optimal dosing regimen w as recommended for Part 2.  
6.2 PREPARATION/H ANDLING/ STORAGE/ ACCOUNTABILITY  
6.2.1  ACQUIS ITION AND A CCOUNTABILITY  
We will use a vitamin D3 supplement in this study  because v itamin D2 is only 
approximately 30% as effective as vitamin D3 in maintaining serum 25(OH)D levels.( 79) 
Bio-Tech Pharmacal, Inc . will package and supply all vitamin D3 products for use in this 
study . The products are licensed, approved drugs . Specific detai ls of this product will be 
provided to study sites in the MO P. Capsule ingredients include v itamin D3 power 
(containing cholecalciferol 0.25% and polyethylene glycol 99.5%), microcrystalline 
cellulose,  and gelatin capsule . Ingredients are free from microbiological content and 
meet USP specification.  
6.2.2  FORMULATION, APPEARANCE, PACKAGING, AND LABELING  
All vitamin D3 doses will be packed in blister packs or individually labeled bottles .  The 
loading doses will be packaged separately from the daily doses ; loading doses will be 
given directly to participants to take during visit 2. P articipant s will take home the 
labeled bottles/packs for their daily (i.e., all but visit 2) doses . Vitamin D supplements 
will be provided in the form of a size 2 capsule, either  gelatin or hypromellose 
(vegetable). The capsules used for all doses in Part 1 were gelatin. T he D3  (4000  IU) 
capsules for Part 2 are vegetable capsules . Size 2 capsules are approximately 18 mm 
in length (0.71  inches) with an outside diameter of 6.3 mm (0 .24 inches).  
6.2.3  PRODUCT STORAGE AND STABILITY  
This product is to be stored at room temperature approximately 20ºC), away from 
moisture and light.   All temperature excursions at sites must be appropriately recorded 
and reported to the study sponsor for further evaluation and follow -up.

The product will be kept ready for administration in a sealed bottle or blister packs . No 
additional  preparation is required.  However, either the pharmacist or designee will do a 
pill count prior to giving the bottle to the participant. For details on the pill count, refer to 
the pharmacy manual.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
Rand omization 
Randomization of participants will be done online using the randomization module of the 
DCOC electronic data capture system. For the first part of the study,  participants w ere 
randomized using a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 1  of 4 dose regimens  after providing consent 
and confirmation of eligibility on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Upon 
completion of the interim PK  analysis, participants in the second part will be randomized 
using a 2:1 ratio to receive the  treatment regimen  or the SoC comparator. The 
randomization will use a stratified block scheme. Stratification will be by age (6- 11 vs 
12- less than 18 years of age) and BMI age and sex percentile at entrance (overweight = 
greater than or equal to 85th% to less than 95th% BMI , obes e = greater than or equal to 
95th% BMI for age and sex, and obese =  greater than or equal to  99th% BMI for age 
and sex).  
Masking  
Masking is not planned for this study . 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
Research assistants will call, email, or text families  at least  biweekly  (every 2 weeks)  to 
provide encouragement regarding adherence to taking the study supplement.  The first 
dose will be witnessed by study staff at V isit 2. Several methods will be employed to 
optimize intervention compliance and document compliance . Participants will not initiate 
treatment unless they demonstrate daily d iary card adherence during the run- in. This 
will minimize dropouts  due to non- adherence.  At Visit 1, participants will be given diary 
cards  (without a line to record Vitamin D dosing)  and taught to  use them to document  
asthma medication use and asthma symptoms.   At visits 2 - 5, diary cards for dosing 
visits will be given to the participant to use to document adherence to daily Vitamin D 
dosing as well as to document asthma medication use and asthma symptoms. 
Pharmacists/designees will perform pill count from sealed bottles prior to dispensing to 
subjects as outlined in the Drug Accountability memo (March 4, 2020) to pharmacists 
from the ISPCTN  DCOC.  
At visits 6 -8, participants will again be given daily dairy cards (without the line to record 
Vitamin D dosing) to document asthma medication use and asthma symptoms .  Similar 
diary cards have been used successfully in numerous large asthma studies  to bolster 
adherence to study drug .(80, 81)

are to measure participant dosing compliance by pill counts and by participant diary 
review, identifying non- compl iance (taking less than 75% of v itamin D3) . Study staff will 
be trained to review the diary cards at the visit with the participant to clarify any issues 
or questions, and to provide positive feedback to participants who demonstrate good 
adherence and ongoing encouragement when warranted at each visit . Sites are to 
make every effort to schedule participant clinic visits ± 7 days of the scheduled visit, per 
the schedule of activities . Enrolling ISPCTN study sites will receive a minimum of 1 on-
site monitoring visit  by a member of the D COC  or their designee, as described in the 
Clinical Monitoring Plan . During the monitoring visit, drug accountability will be 
performed. Sites are to maintain all shipment records and non- dispensed product 
received from Bio- Tech  Pharmacal, Inc.  
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
All drugs and/or treatments, other than specific excluded medications, are permitted 
while on study drug . Use of a n undisclosed exclud ed medication will be a protocol 
deviation.  Similarly, if a participant uses a n exclu ded medication and the instructions in 
this section are not followed, the use of the  exclud ed medication will be a study  
deviation.  Several medications can interfere with the absorption or metabolism of 
vitamin D and alter 25(OH) D levels . If a participant  must start on an  excluded 
medication during the trial period (i.e. after study drug starts) , the participant will 
discontinue study drug but will continue with all other study procedures . New 
medications prescribed for the control of asthma (including sys temic corticosteroids  
used for brief time periods [less than 14 days] or  change in asthma controllers) will not 
result in withdrawal from study drug but will be recorded.  Participants will be advised not 
to take additional supplements containing more than 1000 international units ( IU) of 
vitamin D per day . All concomitant medications including dates of use, formulation, 
dose, and  frequency will be documented during the study period.   
If a participant is taking over -the-counter vitamin supplement(s), study personnel will 
find out what supplement(s) are being taken. This will be done by showing the 
participants and caregivers pictures of supplements that are commonly used by the 
general public . If the supplement is not in the picture set, then the caregiver wi ll be 
asked to bring in the bottle at the next visit. The caregiver will also be asked how 
frequently the supplement is taken. Once the supplement is identified, the study team 
can verify the dose of vitamin D that is being taken by the participant.  Children will be 
allowed to participate if , at the initial visit, the daily dose of v itamin D is less than or 
equal to 1,000 IU per day.  
Concomitant medications will be verified at every visit ; the study team will , therefore,  be 
able to provide on-going guidance and counseling regarding  participants ’ daily intake of 
vitamin D from over -the-counter vitamins .  If a study participant changes over -the-
counter vitamins and the vitamin D dose changes to greater than 1,000 IU per day, the 
study team  will ask the  participant/caregiver to reduce the over -the-counter vitamin D 
dose to 1,000 IU per day  or less . If the participant/caregiver does not follow the request

participant will be r emoved from the study.  
Excluded medications 
• Oral or IV steroids (including prednisone and equivalent dexamethasone or other 
steroid dose) greater than 10 mg/day in the 30 days prior to the screening visit or 
during the run- in period .  
o Oral or parenteral steroids , including doses greater than 10 mg/day,  may 
be used as a n acute asthma control  medicine during trial period as stated 
above.  
• Vitamin D2 within the 30 days  prior to the screening visit or during the run- in 
period.   
• Vitamin D3 supplementation with a daily dosage of  greater  than 100 0 IUs in an 
individual supplement form or as part of a multiv itamin  within the 30 days prior to 
the screening visit or during the run- in period . 
Concomitant Medications  
Notes: changes in the medications below while on study could alter PK of vitamin D and 
information regarding such changes must  be captured. Participants would not 
necessarily have to be withdrawn from the study, but changes in dose for any drug in 
the following list must  be documented.  
• Anti-epileptic drugs  
• Digoxin, calcium channel blockers   
• Statins  
• Calcium supplements  
6.5.1  RESCUE MEDICINE  
The study team will advise participants to have access to asthma rescue medications 
(typically albuterol sulfate) for exacerbations of asthma symptoms per standard of care. 
Management of asthma symptoms will be performed by the participant ’s routine medical 
provider . Oral or parenteral steroids are allowed as rescue medicines for asthma 
exacerbations and should be recorded in the CRF. There is no anticipated need for a 
rescue  medication for the study drug.

DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTIO N 
Discontinuation from taking vitamin D supplements does not mean discontinuation from 
the study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by the 
study protocol . If a clinically significant finding is identified such as an elevated urine 
calcium/creatinine ratio  (greater than 0.37 on 2 measurements) , elevated serum calcium 
level (greater than 1.5×ULN) , or 25(OH)D level greater than100  ng/ml after enrollment, 
the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant 
management is needed including discontinuation of vitamin D supplements . If a 
participant  is dis continued from study  drug (vitamin D supplement) , he or she will be 
asked to complete  any remaining study visits in order to assure his  or her safety and for 
the sake of completeness of data collection. If a participant who has been asked to stop 
taking study drug terminates  (for any reason)  from the study , site coordinators will make 
reasonable efforts to complete a termination visit. The termination visit will include 
routine labs (safety labs at minimum)  and a focused physical exam.  
Rules for h alting of study drug : 
1. Spot urine calcium/creatinine  ratio greater than 0.37 and subsequent serum 
calcium above 1.5×ULN  for the local laboratory . Because dehydration can 
artificially inflate the calcium/creatinine r atio, participant s will be counseled on 
consuming adequate fluids throughout the study . Participants who have an 
elevated spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio will be asked to consume 6 to 8 
eight -ounce glasses of water per day,  and to return within 2  business days of the 
site team receiving initial lab results  for a repeat calcium/creatinine ratio. If the 
repeat ratio is less than or equal to 0.37, study medication will be continued  
without interruption. If the ratio remains greater than 0.37, a local  serum calcium 
level and local 25(OH)D  will be checked. If the serum calcium is less than 
1.5×ULN  and 25(OH)D is less than  100 ng/ml, the participant will continue study 
drug without interruption.  
If a participant develops elevated serum calcium greater th an or equal to 
1.5×ULN or 25(OH)D level greater than  100 ng/ml  by local lab , the participant will 
remain off study drug through the duration of the study, but will continue with all 
other study procedures.  See Section 8.2 for further safety assessment 
information.  
2. Any documented adverse event , which in the opinion of the site investigator 
warrants halting of study drug for participant safety.

25(OH)D level greater than  100 ng/ml, the participant will remain off study drug through 
the duration of the study, but will continue with all other study procedures . 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the 
following:  
• Reason  for discontinuation  
• Serum 25(OH)D and serum calcium  
• Urine calcium /creatinine ratio  
• Concomitant medications  (including vitamin D3 daily dose at screening in either 
individual supplement or as a part of a multivitamin)  
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the 
following reasons:  
• Participant request . Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the 
study at any time for any reason.  
• New medical issues that would make continuing in the study dangerous for the 
participant  
• Pregnancy  
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  at the discretion of the site 
investigator  
• At the discretion of the investigator  
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded. 
Participants  who sign the informed consent form (i.e., are enrolled)  but do not receive 
the study intervention may be replaced. Participants who sign the informed consent 
form, receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw or are withdrawn or 
discontinued from the study will not be replaced.  
Participants who are withdrawn or who discontinue from the study for any reason are 
encouraged to return for final study procedures .

A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for more than 
2 consecutive scheduled visit s and is unable to be contacted by the study site staff.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact the participant , reschedule the missed visit within 
7 days  of the missed visit , counsel the participant on the importance of 
maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 
3 telephone calls followed by  a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods) . These contact attempts must  be 
documented in the participant’s medical record or study file.  
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
8.1 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1.1  CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS 
In the procedure sections below, it should be noted that PK blood samples can be 
collected by venipuncture or by fingerstick microtainer collection method. If the 
participant prefers venipuncture, then blood for inflammatory markers wi ll also be 
drawn.  Fingerstick is not an option for visits 2 and 6 since blood inflammatory markers 
must be assessed for those visits.  
Note phone calls  will be made at least biweekly  (every 2 weeks) from research team to 
participant/family to promote adherence to medication.

Screening Visit  (Visit 1 , Day s -7 to -21) 
The goal of this visit is to explain the study to potential participants, obtain informed 
consent/assent, and collect a brief medical history and laboratory studies  to assess 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . After the Screening Visit is complete, eligible  participants will 
begin the run- in period.  
1. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed. This will include age, BMI, 
asthma diagnosis,  and ability to swallow pills, c onfounding medical 
conditions , and concomitant medications per protocol.  
2. Informed consent/assent will be obtained for eligible participants (see Section 
10.1.1).  Once consent  and assent have been obtained,  the participant is 
enrolled in the study.  
3. Demographic data will be recorded on the data collection form along with 
measured height and weight .  
4. Medical history, including history of asthma exacerbations, will be obtained.   
5. Participants (parent/guardian and child) will be asked to initial a form 
docu menting whether they prefer to have this visit 1 blood sample taken from 
the child’s arm or taken from a fingerstick.  
6. Participants meeting all other eligibility criteria will have samples collected for 
local serum 25(OH) vitamin D assessment , urine pregnancy test (for female 
participant s of child -bearing potential),  and urine calcium/creatinine ratio.  
7. Local safety measures (as described in Section 8.2) will be reviewed by the 
study coordinator to determine eligibility for  continued enrollment. If any 
safety  laboratory  value exceeds the thresholds defined by pr otocol, the 
participant will be referred to the participant’s primary care physician . 
8. Diary cards , (without the line to record Vitamin D dosing) , will be given to the 
participant and instructions for completion of the diary will be reviewed.  These 
diary cards will have the questions about asthma control and symptoms and 
asthma medications , but will not have the questions about vitamin D dosing.

Study Visit 2 must occur between 10 and 21 days , with a target of 14 days,  after Study 
Visit 1 . The goal of this visit is to review eligibility for continued enrollment , provide study 
procedure training , and randomize participant s. 
1. Interval history (concomitant medications, asthma  symptoms, healthcare 
utilization) and diary cards  (without the line to record Vitamin D dosing)  will be 
reviewed at V isit 2 to assess eligibility for study participation.  
a. Site must confirm that participant continues to meet inclusion/exclusion 
criteria ex cept for age less than  18 years . 
b. To be randomized, participants must complete and return diary cards 
with a completion rate greater than or equal to 75% . Parti cipants who 
do not meet this  level of  adherence will be removed from the study.  
2. An ACT  or c-ACT will be completed by the caregiver and/or child, as 
appropriate.  
3. Height and weight measurements for calculation of BMI and BMI -percentile.  
4. Blood draw (by venipuncture) for central l aboratory 25(OH)D level  
determination and i nflammatory marker  assays.   
5. Study drug will be dispensed and dosing explained to the participant and his 
or her parent, legal guardian, or caregiver . (See Section 6.1.2).  
6. Diary cards  for dosing visits  will be given to the participant and instructions for 
completion of the diary will be reviewed.  
7. Study V isit 3 will be scheduled for 28 days ( ±7) from S tudy Visit 2. 
Weeks 1-3 (no mandatory  visits; optional  visit for PK  blood draw ) 
Adherence communications w ill occur at least bi weekly  (every 2 weeks)  between study 
Visits 2 and 3. The study coordinator will interact with the participants and his or her 
parent, legal guardian, or caregiver  through text  message,  phone, or email to encourage 
conti nued participation in the study , monitor  adherence to medications , and ask about 
interval asthma symptoms.   
Sites will ask participants to return for serum 25(OH)D level between 1- 3 weeks  (days 7 
to 21, inclusive)  after the first dose of vitamin D . Every effort will be made to collect this 
sample, but t his blood draw will be optional.  If the participant consents to the optional 
visit, the participant (parent/guardian and child) will be asked to initial a form 
documenting whether they prefer to have this v isit’s blood sample taken by 
venipuncture or fingerstick .

8.1.1.2  ASTHMA MEASURES 
Asthma Control Test (ACT)  
The ACT is a 4 -week recall questionnaire that has been validated and addresses issues 
of asthma control, symptoms, and nocturnal awakenings for patients with asthma aged 
12 and above.( 82) The ACT will be administered to 12 to 18- year-olds at all in -person 
clinic visits.  
Childhood Asthma Control Test (c -ACT)  
The c -ACT is a 4 -week recall questionnaire that has been validated and addresses 
issues of asthma control, symptoms, activity limitation, and nocturnal awakenings for 
patients aged 4 to 11 years with asthma). The c -ACT will be administered to 6 to 
11- year- olds at all in -person visits.  
Participants that turn 12 during the course of the study will continue to use the c -ACT 
test for the duration of their participation . 
Asthma -related Events 
The presence of asthma- related events ( ASDs , exacerbations, episodes of problematic 
asthma, respiratory infections) will be identified by participant documentation on daily 
diary cards (collected at all clinic visits) and by structured interviews at in- person clinic 
visits.  
1. ASDs:  
A diary card will be used to compile information about asthma symptoms. Though diary 
cards similar to those proposed for VDORA have been used successfully in large 
highly-controlled pediatric asthma trials, symptom diaries can be criticized for some 
participants having incomplete data.  Symptom diaries however can be used 
successfully particularly in intervention trials less than 26 weeks (as with VDORA) and 
when participants are frequently reminded and supported closely by research staff . (76, 
77)

a. Albuterol rescue use (pre- exercise treatment permitted)  
b. Use of additional asthma medications including oral steroids. In addition, the 
7 days immediately following the end of a course of oral steroids will be 
considered ASDs.  
c. Daytime or nighttime asthma symptoms (wheezing, coughing, phlegm/mucus, 
chest tightness, or shortness of breath)  
d. Unscheduled health care provider visits for asthma, emergency room visit or 
hospital admission for asthma, or missed work or school due to asthma  
Baseline frequency of AS Ds will be documented for each participant using the 
participant’s run- in period and Week 1 (if needed) diary cards to explore changes in 
mean ASD/week longitudinally on treatment.  
2. Asthma Exacerbation  
In this study an asthma exacerbation will be defined ac cording to the recommendation 
of the NIH Outcomes Workshop ( 84) as a worsening of asthma requiring the use of a 
systemic corticosteroid (at least 2 days of treatment) to prevent a serious outcome. In 
accordance with the Expert Panel recommendations, data wi ll be captured on the 
following exacerbation- related outcomes:  
a. All worsening asthma events in which systemic corticosteroids were initiated 
to prevent a serious outcome, including use of systemic corticosteroids in 
association with any form of healthcare provider encounter  
b. All asthma -specific ED or urgent care visits that involved treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids  
c. All asthma -specific hospitalizations that involved treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids (also reported as an SAE)  
d. All asthma -specifi c intensive care unit admissions or intubations (also 
reported as an SAE)  
e. All deaths (all -cause and asthma- related; also reported as an SAE)

by at least 1 week to count as 2 exacerbations and to be documented as such.  
3. Episode of problematic asthma  
Any asthma- related unscheduled healthcare visit (outpatient, urgent care, ED).  
4. Respiratory tract infection  
Patient -reported episodes of upper respiratory tract infection (cold), sore throat, 
strep throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, ear infection, and acute sinusitis (sinus 
infection) will be documented from structured interviews occurring at each study 
visit and planned study phone call. This approach has been used successfully i n 
large pediatric asthma trials . (80) 
8.1.2  LABORATORY EVALUATIO NS 
Specimens for evaluation include:  
• Safety assessments (volumes to be determined by laboratory facility at local site; 
methodology to be determined by the laboratory facility at the local site)  
o Urine for pregnancy test  for female participants of childbearing  potential  (done 
only at Visit  1, Visit 4,  and Visit 6/ Early Termination) . 
o Blood f or serum 25(OH)D level at Visit 1 (Screening)  and Follow -up visit 9  
(week 28).  
o Urine for creatinine/calcium ratio to be done at Screening  and study V isits 3, 
4, 5, and 6. Blood for serum calcium will be collected if indicated due to a high 
urine calcium/creatinine ratio.  
• Study assessments (to be performed by a College of American Pathologists 
[CAP]  accredited  and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [ CLIA ] 
certified  central laboratory) . 
o 25(OH) vitamin D level by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
(specimen collection per laboratory  manual ) to be done at  Baseline  (visit 2)  
and study Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6 as well as  follow- up (visits 7, 8, and 9) . There is 
an optional visit , with a blood draw for  vitamin D analysis,  between Week 1 
and 3,  if the participant volunteers for this.  
o Cytokine panel ( IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL -17, and TNF -alpha)  by immunoassay  as 
cytokine panel (specimen collection per laboratory manual ) to be done at 
Baseline  and at Visit  6 and, if the participant agrees to blood collection by 
venipuncture, at  Visits 3, 4, and 5 , and Follow -up (visits 7, 8, and 9).

8, and 9) . 
Laboratory determinations of vitamin D levels  
25(OH)D levels for study endpoints will be determined at a  CAP accredited and CLIA 
certified  central laboratory . Vitamin D levels will be obtained at the local laboratory for 
determining inclusion criteria (25(OH)D level less than 30 ng/ml but great than 
10 ng/mL ) and for safety measurements  at the local investigator’s discretion, ensuring 
prompt turn around.  
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS 
Vitamin D is a very safe supplement with a large therapeutic index. Vitamin D 
sufficiency is considered to be greater than  30 ng/ml. Intoxication does not occur until 
serum 25(OH)D levels exceed 150 ng/ml ( 325 nmol/L) .(85) However, most clinical 
laboratories consider 100 ng/ml to be the upper limit in order to maintain a wide safety 
margin. Reports of vitamin D toxicity are rare and virtually always related to faulty 
manufacturing or labeling of product such that individual s ingested hundreds to 
thousands of times the presumed dose. (86, 87) The consequence of vitamin D toxicity 
is hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia only results when 25(OH)D concentrations have 
consistently been above 150- 200 ng/ml (375- 500 nmol/L). (85) 
To ensure safety in this study, s pot urine calcium/creatinine levels will be measured at 
each visit  as a screen for hypercalc iuria. The study coordinator will instruct the 
participant and his or her parent, legal guardian, or caregiver  to ensure that the child is 
well-hydrated prior to the study visit . If the urine calcium/creatinine  level is greater than  
0.37 on a specimen, the participant  will be asked again to ensure good hydration and 
return within 2  business days for a repeat spot urine calcium/creatinine measurement . If 
the ratio remains  greater than 0.37, then a serum calcium level and 25(OH)D for the 
local laboratory will be obtained. (75) If serum calcium is greater than 1.5× ULN or the 
25(OH)D level is greater than 1 00 ng/ml, the participant  will have supplementation 
stopped but will be asked to return for remaining study visits in order to obtain data on 
vitamin D clearance and for safety  assessments. Vitamin D supplementation ends at 16 
weeks  (day 112 ±7) for all participants. They will be followed for another twelve weeks 
for determination of elimination kinetics and for safety  assessments . The half -life of 
vitamin D is variable but is felt to be approximately 2 months. (88) The 12- week follow -
up therefore consists of 1.5 half -lives. A serum 25(OH)D level will be drawn for the local 
laboratory saf ety measure at week 28 (visit 9; day 196 ± 7). If a participant  has a serum 
25(OH)D level greater than 80 ng/ml at that time, he/she will be asked to return 4 weeks 
later for a re- check to ensure that the level is not continuing to rise as vitamin D washes 
out of adipose tissue.  If there are any ongoing concerns, further follow up will be 
determined by the local investigator in collaboration with the child’s primary care team 
and sub- specialists as necessary.

Each participant is required to have an identified asthma- care provider at entry.  This 
can be a specialist or a primary care provider. If it is found that a participant’s asthma is 
poorly controlled,  he or she will be refer red back to the primary asthma- care provider for 
reevaluation and further treatment.  
If any child is found to be in the midst of an asthma exacerbation at the time of a study 
visit, the study staff will notify the local PI and take appropriate action to guarantee 
safety of the child. This may include referral to an Urgent Care or Emergency facility or 
may involve the local PI treating the participant if he  or she is the child’s asthm a care 
provider.  
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND ADVERSE 
REACTIONS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention 
in humans, whether or not considered int ervention related.   
AR means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse events  where there is reason conclude that the drug caused the 
event.  
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS OR REACTIONS  
An AE or suspected AR is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator 
or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergi c bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.

8.3.3.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For AEs and ARs  not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following 
guidelines will be used to describe severity . The site investigator will determine severity . 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures . Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily act ivity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment . Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating . Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily 
equate to “serious .” 
8.3.3.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY  INTERVENTION 
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by the clinician who 
examines and evaluates the participant based on temporal relationship and his/her 
clinical judgment . The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the  
categori es below . In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Definitely Related –  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, 
and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out . The clinical event, 
including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals . The response to withdrawal of 
the study intervention (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible . The event 
must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a 
satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related –  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is  unlikely . The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals, and follows a clini cally reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge) . Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.

(e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time af ter administration of the trial 
medication) . However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e. g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events) . Although an AE may 
rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring 
more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely 
related,”  as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related –  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, whose temporal relationship to study interv ention administration makes a 
causal relationship improbable (e. g., the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or 
chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations  (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related –  The AE is completely independent of study intervention 
administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to 
another etiology . There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by 
the clinician.  
8.3.3.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The expectedness of an AE or suspected AR shall be determined according to the 
specified reference document containing safety information (e .g., most current  product 
information or product label) . Any AE that is not identified in nature, severity, or 
specificity in the current study drug reference document (s) (e .g., product information) is 
considered unexpected. Events that are mentioned in the product informa tion as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of 
the drug, but not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug in this 
study are considered unexpected . 
Expected AEs that could occur in this s tudy are: bruising related to 
venipuncture/ finger stick, pain related to venipuncture/ fingerstick , increase in calcium in 
the blood or urine, k idney stones , accidental  vitamin D poisoning (associated nausea

FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during 
study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon 
review by a study monitor.  All AEs including local and systemic reactions will be 
captured on the appropriate CRF . Information to be collecte d includes event description, 
time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed 
only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event . All AEs occurrin g while on study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship . All AEs must be followed until  1 of 
the following criteria is met:  resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained or is judged by the P I to be no longer clinically significant, or the participant  is 
lost to follow -up 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE . However, if the study participant’ s 
condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode.  At each study 
visit, the investigator  or study coordinator  will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  The site investigator  will record all reportable events with start dates 
occurring any time after informed consent is obtained. Events will be followed for 
outcome information until resolution or stabilization or until 7 days (for non- serious AEs) 
or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation .  
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT  AND REACTION REPORTING  
All AEs  and ARs  that occur after informed consent is obtained until 7 days  after the last 
day of study  participation should be documented in the patient's source documents in 
accordance with the Investigator's normal clinical practice and in the AE section of the 
CRF.  
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T AND REACTION REPORTING  
The site investigator will report all SAE s and SARs  occur ring any time after informed 
consent is obtained until 30 days after the last day of study participation.  The study 
clinician will immediately report to the sponsor any SAE, whether or not considered 
study intervention related, including those listed in the protocol or product information 
and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study intervention caused the event . Study endpoints that are SAEs  (e.g., all-cause 
mortality) must be reported in accordance with the pr otocol unless there is evidence 
suggesting a causal relationship between the study intervention and the event (e. g., 
death from anaphylaxis) . In that case, the investigator must immediately report the 
event to the sponsor.

into the appropriate module of the electronic case report form ( eCRF ), which will 
automatically result in distribution of the information to the appropriate sponsor contact . 
If the eCRF system is tem porarily unavailable, the event, including the investigator -
determined causality to study drug, must  be reported via a paper back -up SAE form to 
the appropriate sponsor contact . Upon return of the availability of electronic data 
capture  system, the SAE information must be entered into the eCRF.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to 
be chronic , or until the participant is stable, or until 30 days after the last day of study 
participat ion. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by the 
DCO C/study sponsor and should be provided as soon as possible.  
8.3.7  REPORTING E VENT S TO PARTICIPANTS  
The participants will be notified of those study -related (or potentially study -related) 
SAEs , SARs  and unanticipated problems  (UPs) that may affect either the participants’ 
willingness to continue with the study or the future health of the child enrolled in the 
study . This determination can be made by any of the following: the IRB, the medi cal 
monitor, the D SMB , or the sponsor . The person or oversight body that makes the 
determination will inform the DCOC, which will instruct the site PIs/study coordinators to 
contact those participants enrolled through their site.  Contacts with participants, if 
necessary, will be recorded on the appropriate CRF and/or study log.  
8.3.8  EVENTS OF SPECIAL IN TEREST  
Not applicable.  
8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNAN CY  
As noted above in Section 2.3.1, vitamin D supplementation is safe in pregnancy . 
However, to be extrem ely cautious , participants of childbearing  potential will be 
counseled to us e acceptable forms of birth control as well as condoms during the study 
period. Abstinence is considered an acceptable form of birth control . There are no 
known risks of vitamin D intake during pregnancy . 
We will follow standard pharmaceutical study practices in regards to pregnancy to make 
sure we account for the possibility of untoward and unexpected effects on a fetus . If a 
participant becomes pregnant during the study , dosing will be discontinued immediately .  
If a subject reports a pregnancy , we will use a specific pregnancy follow -up form to track 
the outcome of the pregnancy for the subject.   On this form, we will document how the 
pregnancy diagnosis was made, whether the subject has received a medical evaluation 
for the pregnancy (and where), and what the outcome of the pregnancy was (e.g., 
miscarriage, elective abortion, live birth or stillbirth).  We will also record maternal history 
(including congenital abnormalities or pregnancy complications)  and estimated date of 
conception.

the case of miscarriage or pregnancy termination). This will occasionally require us to 
follow participants  after they have completed this  study.   
For all live births, we will document the mode of delivery,  gestational delivery age, the 
birth weight, whether there were any health problems  (infant and/or mother)  at delivery, 
and whether the baby required a hospitalization beyond 2 days.   These data will all be 
self-reported by the participant.   We will monitor all pregnancy -related outcomes, and 
will request permission to obtain medical records for any participant in which adverse 
pregnancy -related outcomes are reported.     
Any associated AEs or SAEs that occur to the mother or fetus/child will be recorded in 
the AE or SAE eCRF.  
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLE MS 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, 
or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studi ed; 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
• Suggests that the r esearch places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
An unanticipated problem is not necessarily an AE or SAE . Unanticipated problems that 
are neither an AE nor SAE, but which must be reported, are listed  below in S ection 
8.4.2.  
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLE M REPORTING  
Unanticipated problems (per S ection 8.4.1) must be reported to the reviewing IRB, the 
DCOC, the s ponsor , and the NIH DSMB as well as any other persons or groups noted 
in the DSMB  charter . These problems must be reported to the reviewing IRB according 
to the reviewing IRB’s policies and procedures and reported to local institutions 
according to the rules and regulations of the local institution. The reviewing IRB will 
report the issue to OHRP per the policies of the reviewing IRB . For the UAMS  IRB,

9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
Study objective : The overall objective of this study is to determine the PK of Vitamin D 
supplementation in children who have asthma and  are overweight  or obese and 
therefore no formal hypothesis testing will be performed.  
Part 1 Objective: Identify dosing to use in Part 2 using PK analysis on a subset of 
participants Part 2 Objective: Determine the effectiveness of a recommended 16- week 
dosing regimen to achieve a serum level of 25(OH)D greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml 
in vitamin D insufficient or deficient children who have asthma and are 
overweight/ obese  
The hypothesis for Part 2  will be tested using the one- group Chi -square test at the  5% 
one-sided significance level.  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
Part 1 : a sample size of greater than 50 participants will be powered (greater than 80%) 
to target a 95% confidence interval within  60% and 140% of the geometric mean 
estimates of 25(OH)D s ystemic  clearance. The sample size assumes a coefficient of 
variation of 50% in 25(OH)D steady -state concentration.( 48, 89) Based on prior 
experience ( 90, 91, 92, 93) a sample size of 16 participant s in the interim analysis will 
suffice to determine a recommended dose for Part 2.  
Part 2 : For the optimal dosing regimen defined by the interim PK -analysis, the null 
hypothesis that the proportion of children who achieve a vitamin D level of  greater than 
or equal to 40 ng/ ml is 50% or less at 16 weeks will be tested against the alternative 
hypothesis that the proportion is 75% or more at the one- sided 0.05 significance level 
with power of 0.90. Using the one group Chi -square test for testing a single proportion, 
the number of study participants required to complete Part 2 is 31  participants. To allow 
for an approximately  30% dropout rate  (due, in part, to the COVID -19 pandemic) , 
63 participants will be randomized to (A) the 8,000 IU daily  dose (with a 50,000 IU 
loading dose)  regimen or to (B) the  standard of care (600 IU/day ) dose.  The allocation 
ratio will be  2:1 (A:B) . 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
PK analysis Population: All participants with at least 1 PK sample will be included in 
the population PK analysis . 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: This population includes all enrolled participants . 
Analysis of the ITT population will be used for all non- PK analys es. 
Safety Population:  This analysis population includes all enrolled participants who 
received at least one dose of study treatment.

9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
Following finalization of the Protocol, but prior to 25% enrollment, a Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, which will provide detailed analytical 
plans for the set of analyses outlined below . All statistical analyses will be conducted 
following the statistical principles for clinical trials as specified in Intern ational 
Conference on Harmonization Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials ( ICH Topic E9 ). 
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final 
integrated clinical study report . All study data and summary tables will be presented 
overall and by study sites.  
Descriptive statistics for continuous data will be summarized using mean and standard 
deviation or median and interquartile range, as appropriate. Categorical data will be 
summarized using frequency and percent . Any o utliers detected during data review will 
be investigated and methods for handling outliers or data transformation will be defined 
in the SAP.  
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY  ENDPOINT  
The study does not include an efficacy endpoint. The primary objective is to conduct a 
population PK analysis.     
A population PK analysis will be performed to characterize the PK of vitamin D in 
overweight/obese children using the software Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modeling 
(NONMEM, version 7.2). Different structural PK models (e. g., 1 and 2 compartment) 
with linear or non- linear (e .g., Michaelis -Menten) kinetics will be fitted to the 
concentration- time data of 25(OH)D. Between- participant variability on mod el 
parameters and different residual error models will be tested. Model development will be 
guided by goodness of fit plots, plausibility of parameter estimates, and reduction in 
inter-individual variability for structural and residual error parameters, as  well as 
objective function and shrinkage values.  
Covariate evaluation will be performed to examine the relationship between model 
parameters and demographic factors (e .g., age, weight status, ethnicity) and co-
administered medications, as applicable. Mor e detail about the weight status measures 
used in the model will be included in the SAP. Appropriate covariates will be 
incorporated into the model using a standard forward inclusion- backward elimination 
approach. Standard model diagnostic plots and proced ures will be used to evaluate 
model appropriateness. Model validation will be performed using visual predictive check 
and bootstrapping.  
Using the final PK model and parameter estimates, serum concentration- time profiles of 
25(OH)D will be simulated for each participant at varied dosing regimens. The 
percentage of participants with serum 25(OH)D greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml during 
a desired time period will be calculated. The best dosing regimen will be determined as 
the one resulted in serum 25(OH)D g reater than or equal to 40 ng/ml in a majority (i.e.

will not end up being the dose chosen for a larger randomized, controlled, double-
masked intervention trial. Creat ion of a PK model will determine the optimal dosing 
strategy in P art 2 to achieve serum vitamin D levels greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml.  
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE PART 1 ENDPOINT  
This analysis w as done including participants randomized in part 1.  Dose finding w as 
done using the PK model and parameter estimates, serum concentration- time profiles of 
25(OH)D w as simulated for each participant at varied dosing regimens. The percentage 
of participants with serum 25(OH)D greater than or equal t o 40 ng/ml during a desi red 
time period w as calculated. The best dosing regimen w as determined as the one 
resulted in serum 25(OH)D greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml in a majority (i.e. 75%) of 
participants. It is possible that the doses outlined and evaluated in this study will not end 
up being the dose chosen for a larger randomized, controlled, double- masked 
intervention trial. Creation of a PK model determined  the optimal dosing strategy in P art 
2 to achieve serum vitamin D levels greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml. The partici pants 
who achieved  a vitamin D level of greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml w ere estimated 
along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval for each dose regimen in Part 1. 
A one -group test of proportion will be used to analyze the overall proportion of 
participants with 25(OH)D greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml at 16  weeks among 
participants treated with the final recommended dose in Part 2.  
9.4.4  ANAYLSIS OF PART 2 ENDPOINTS  
The participants who achieve a vitamin D level of greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml will 
be estimated along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval for each dose 
regimen in Part 1. A one- group test of proportion will be used to analyze the overall 
proportion of participants with 25(OH)D greater than or equal to 40 ng/ml at 16 weeks  
among participants treated with the final recommended dose in Part 2.  
9.4.5  SAFETY ANALYSES 
All AEs recorded during the study period will be coded with Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  Version M arch 2018. All participants enrolled in the 
study will be evaluated for safety . Summaries of AE will be tabulated for the following 
types:  
• Number (%) of participants with any AE  or AR  
• Number (%) of participants with any SAE  or SAR  
• Number (%) of participants withdrawn from treatment due to AE  
All summa ries will be reported overall and by study site. Additional analyses and 
summaries may be derived if deemed appropriate and will be further described in the 
SAP.

Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized overall and by study site. 
Summary statistics will be applied for both continuous and categorical variables . For 
continuous measures, descriptive measures will include number of non- missing values, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,  and maximum . For categorical variables, 
descriptive statistics will include frequency counts and percentages by category.  
9.4.7  PLANNED INTERIM ANAL YSES  
An interim PK analysis w as performed after  a minimum of  16 participant s (at least 4 in 
each arm) comp leted PK sampling at Week 20 (visit 7) in P art 1 of the study . The 
interim PK analysis provided  an optimal dosing regimen  for P art 2.  
Results of the Part  1 analysis w ere presented to the DSMB  along with the 
recommended new dose.  Enrollments at the new dose will begin after DSMB  approval.  
9.4.8  SUBGROUP  ANALYSES 
Minimal subgroup analyses will be performed.  
9.4.9  TABULATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT DATA  
A detailed description of participant disposition will be provided. The number of enrolled 
participants will be tabulated overall  and by study site and presented as counts and 
percentages . Additionally, the number of participants either completing or discontinuing 
the study will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
9.4.10 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES  
At each study visit, ACT (or c -ACT) and ASDs  will be computed  to monitor asthma 
control . The presence and number of severe asthma exacerbations (as defined by the 
need for oral or parenteral corticosteroids), unscheduled asthma- related healthcare 
utilizations, and asthma- related hospitalizations will be collected. General estimating 
equations will be used to assess changes in the number of exacerbations, A SDs and 
the ACT  (or c-ACT) score over time.  
Baseline and 16- week inflammatory biomarkers (leptin  plus TNFα, IL -2, IL-6, IL-10 and 
IL-17 (cytokine panel) ) will be collected to assess changes on v itamin D 
supplementation. Participants who opt for venipuncture for vitamin D levels (rather than 
fingerstick) will have blood drawn for inflammatory markers at more times.  Total 
25(OH)D, c hanges in 25(OH)D , changes in individual biomarkers , and asthma 
outcomes  will be explored.

To compare the proportion of participants that achieve the serum 25(OH)D levels 
greater than 40 ng/ml target among the standard of care group and the optimal PK dose 
group, differences in sample proportions will be evaluated by chi -square or Fisher ’s 
exact test as appropriate. Additionally, proportion difference with the 95% confidence 
interval will be obtained.  
  
Participants will be defined as a responder or non- responder at the 16- week visit 
according to the serum level criteria (i.e., achieve a serum 25(OH)D of greater than or 
equal to 40 ng/ml at 16 weeks).  Participants who withdraw prematurely will be 
consider ed non -responders in the primary analysis.  
To investigate the effect of missing data on the proportion of response endpoint, a 
sensitivity analysis will be carried out using a multiple imputation approach.  Additionally, 
all participants who do not complete the recommended 16- weeks dosing regimen will be 
regarded be excluded from the per -protocol analysis population.

care and their  children’s medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to 
participate in the study . A copy of the informed consent and assent documents (if 
separate form used) will be given to the participants/parents/guardians for their records.  
Assent is a process for children who have not reached the age of majority . The age at 
which assent is required is dependent on cent ral IRB (i.e., the UAMS IRB) and any local 
site requirements for relying sites . All sites will be using the UAMS IRB as the IRB of 
record ; per the UAMS IRB , the age of assent is 7 years old. All children who are 7 years 
old or older must agree to be partic ipants in the study . Simply not disagreeing does 
NOT constitute assent.   
The informed consent process, as well as the child’s assent, will be conducted and will 
be documented in the source documents (research or medical record of the participant) . 
The documentation will include, but is not limited to: (a) the title of the study, (b) the date 
the participant  entered into the study, (c) the name of the P I, (d) the name of the site 
investigator, (e) the name of the person(s) obtaining the informed consent and assent, 
and (e) a statement that the participant or legally authorized representative received a 
copy of the signed form . Additional documentation that is recommended, but not 
required, includes: (a) list of who else was present during the process, (b) type of 
questions asked by the participant, (c) details that demonstrate the participant 
understands the information, and (d) other specific details related to that case.

10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended at 1 or more sites if the reviewing IRB does 
not authorize renewal at the time of continuing review . Potential problems include, but 
are not limited to,  information not received in time for continuing review to occur before 
the 1- year authorization period is up or issues that need to be address prior to re-
authorization. The study may also be suspended or stopped per any 
stopping/suspension specifications  in the DSMB  charter . Early termination may be 
permanent if there is sufficient cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for 
study suspension or termination, will be provided, directly or indirectly, by the 
suspending or terminating party to the  following as applicable: study participants, PI , 
site investigators, reviewing IRB, local IRBs, the N IH, the ISP CTN DCOC, and the 
OHRP . Persons and offices notified shall include those specified in the study MOP, the 
reviewing IRB’s policies and procedures, and the SMART IRB policies and procedures. 
When study participants are contacted, they shall be informed of any changes to the 
study visit schedule.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited 
to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping   
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the primary  endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility  
If the study was temporarily suspended, the study may resume once concerns about 
safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, and satisfy the DSMB , the 
reviewing IRB, the local IRB(s) (when applicable), the funding agency, and/or the 
sponsor (ISPCTN DCOC).

Participant confidentiality is held strictly in trust by the participating investigators, their 
staff, and the sponsor(s) and their agents . This confidentiality is extended to cover 
testing of biological samples, in addition to the clinical information relating to 
participating participants.  
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be 
held in strict co nfidence . No information concerning the study or the data will be 
released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.  
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator . This 
documentation includes, but is not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) 
and pharmacy records for the participants in this study . Clinical study sites will permit 
access to such records.  
The PI will ensure that the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) 
obtained during this research study complies with the Federal Privacy Regulation. In the 
U.S., the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Pr ivacy Rule 
applies . The rule provides U.S. federal protection for the privacy of PHI  sent to or 
collected in the U.S. for the purposes of this research by implementing standards to 
protect and guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health in formation of 
participants participating in clinical trials . “Authorization” is required from each research 
participant (i .e., specific permission granted by an individual to a covered entity for the 
use or disclosure of an individual’s PHI ). A valid author ization must meet the 
implementation specifications under the applicable Federal Privacy Regulations . The 
relevant privacy authorization will either be combined with the informed consent form 
(ICF) or will be provided as a separate document. If the privacy  authorization is 
presented as a separate form, a copy of the signed form will be given to the 
participant/participant’s legal guardian.  The HIPAA authorization, in addition to the ICF, 
will be approved by the IRB of record.  
Records will be maintained as r equired by the privacy and security rules promulgated by 
HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Title 45 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 164) . The following links direct the reader to the rules:

program supported by the N IH. The data coordination, technical instruction, data 
standards, quality control and assurance, and operational coordination for the clinical 
trial protocol outlined here (and for the ISPCTN overall) is provided by the D COC.  The 
work of ISPCTN is governed by the Steering Committee, which includes representati ves 
from all 17 state awarded clinical trial sites, as well as representatives from the DCOC 
and the NIH . Overseeing the work of the Steering Committee is the NIH ECHO O ffice, 
as well as an executive Leadership Committee. This clinical trial protocol was 
completed by a team of content experts and DCOC staff and was reviewed by the 
members of the Airways Working Group within the ISPCTN . Further review was 
completed by the NIH Protocol Review Committee as well as a DSMB . 
10.1.6 SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
Safety oversight wil l be under the direction of a DSMB  composed of individuals with the 
appropriate expertise, including  pediatrics, PK, and biostatistics . Members of the DSMB  
should be independent from the study conduct and free of conflict of interest, or 
measures should be  in place to minimize perceived conflict of interest . The DSMB  will 
meet on a regular basis, per the DSMB  charter,  to assess safety and efficacy data of 
the study . The DSMB  will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be 
written and review ed at the organizational meeting of the DSMB . At this time, each data 
element that the DSMB  needs to assess will be clearly defined. The DSMB  will provide 
its input to the NIH and the IND/ sponsor . 
The role of the Medical Monitor (MM) is to provide input on safety considerations, 
evaluate safety trends, and to provide oversight throughout the life cycle of the clinical 
research, in accordance with the approved protocol.  This role includes review and 
monitoring of safety events on a regular basis, advising the protocol investigators on 
trial-related medical questions or problems, as needed, and to review cumulative 
participant safety data and make recommendations regarding the data to the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board.  The Medical Monitor will remain blinded to  treatment 
assignment during safety event review, unless unblinding is warranted to optimize 
management of an adverse event or for other safety reasons.  
10.1.7 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of t rial 
participants are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and 
verifiable, and that the conduct of the trial complies  with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment(s), with I CH GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).   
• Monitoring for this study will be performed by a member of the DCOC clinical 
operations staff  or their designee.  
• Monitoring will be planned to be conducted on site or remotely  at least once 
during the course of the study and if needed for cause.

which will be included in the MOP . The plan describes in detail who will conduct 
the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail 
monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports.  
Independent audits of the monitoring system will not be conducted by the ISPCTN 
DCOC.  
10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND Q UALITY CONTROL  
Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and 
biological specimen collection (if applicable), documentation, and completion. Each site 
will follow the trial- specific M OP and any additional written site- specific processes , as 
applicable. These processes  may include, but not necessaril y be limited to:  
(a) procedures for recruitment, (b) data collection, entry, review and submission 
processes, (c) roles and responsibilities of site personnel, and (d) training methods for 
study staff.  
Following the DCOC specific processes on monitoring, the monitors will verify that the 
clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are 
collected, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, the 
trial-specific MOP, site -specific  processes , the [ICH] E6( R2) Good Clinical Practice : 
Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) , and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Quality control (QC) procedures for the database and DCOC -maintained records will be 
implemented in accordance with the MOP, DSMB  charter , and applicabl e DCOC and 
site-specific processes . Information about any data anomalies will be communicated to 
the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  There will be electronic field checks, database 
listings, and quality control reports implemented to monitor data quality.  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial -related sites, source 
data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the D COC 
and inspection by local and regulatory authorities.  Issues uncovered during Quality 
Assurance ( QA), QC, or monitoring activities will be addressed by making simple 
corrections or doing a root cause analysis, followed by instituting Corrective and 
Preventative Action (CAPA), as appropriate and as described in the MOP.  
Vendors performing study activities, such as specimen processing, will also be 
evaluated prior to study start to ensure they have in place standard operating 
procedures. Quality checks will be implemented to ensure they are following  the trial-
specific MOP, their standard operating procedures and the protocol.

10.1.9.1  DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
The data and workflow for the study will be described and documented in a formal data 
management plan . The data management plan and associated documentation will 
specify all operations performed on data from origination to database lock, including 
detailed descriptions of source documentation, CRFs, instructions for completing forms, 
data handling and record keeping procedures , procedures for data monitoring, and 
reconciliation procedures and coding dictionaries to be used, if applicable. The data 
management plan will also describe the specific data collection and management 
responsibilities required of the sponsor, PI, the award site, clinical site(s), 
laboratory/laboratories (if applicable), and the D COC The data management plan 
contents will be consistent with those described in the Good Clinical Data Management 
Practices (GCDMP). Components of the data management plan  docume nting 
operations performed on the data will be provided to the PI  for review and approval prior 
to implementation.  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the individual sites under 
the supervision of the site investigator . The investigator is responsible for ensuring the 
accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All source 
documents must be completed using standard good documentation practices 
(attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, and accurate).  
Hardcopies of any data recorded on paper CRFs  or study visit worksheets/assessment 
forms will be provided for use as source documents for recording data for each 
participant enrolled in the study . Data recorded in eCRFs derived from source 
docu ments must  be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents.  
Clinical data (including demographics, physical examinations, and intervention- specific 
questionnaires) and applicable clinical laboratory data will be entered into a 21 CFR 
Part 11 -compliant data capture system provided by the ISPCTN D COC  at the UAMS . 
The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as 
automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  
Data submitted from sites to the DCOC will not be de -identified since the data will 
include date of birth and may include other information that could possibly be linked 
back to the participant. Data will be de -identified before sharing externally.  
10.1.9.2  STUDY RECORDS RETENT ION  
Throughout the course of the study, all sites will retain a copy of the source documents 
on site in accordance with current site- specific medical record storage procedures.  All 
study documents must  be retained in accordance with local and/or federal regulations, 
whichever is most stringent . No records will be destroyed without the written consent of 
the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the inv estigator 
when these documents no longer need to be retained.

Protocol deviations are any instances in which the protocol , or any applicable DCOC or 
site-specific processes or  applicable regulations are  not followed as written. Deviations 
are not allowed; all deviations shall, therefore, be recorded in the study source 
documents . Whenever a deviation occurs, there must be an assessment  of the severity 
and risk of the deviation.  Depending on the results of the assessment, either a 
corrective action or a simple, 1- time correction shall be implemented. A corrective action 
institutes a process designed to keep that specific problem from happening again. 
Typically, a determination of the root cause of the problem is completed in order to 
develop the most appropriate corrective action plan.  
The specific methods for handling protocol deviations will be provided in the study -
specific M OP and/or site- specific processes . 
10.1.11  PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the following publication and data 
sharing policies and regulations:

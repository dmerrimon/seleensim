1. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Primary Aim 
 
To determine the incidence of successfully achieving peripheral blood concentration of methotrexate of 
50-80µM in patients at high risk of drug toxicity after a 24 hour infusion of high-dose methotrexate 
treated according to our institutional treatment algorithm for individualized methotrexate dosing. 
 
1.2 Secondary Aims 
1.2.1 To determine the incidence of the following side effects in high risk patients receiving high 
dose methotrexate as a 24 hour infusion: nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, mucositis, 
hepatotoxicity, and myelosuppression. 
1.2.2 To describe host polymorphisms that may identify risk of methotrexate toxicity or success of 
this institutional protocol. 	
1.2.3 To describe predictors of successfully achieving an optimum concentration of methotrexate 
at the end of a 24 hour infusion of HDMTX in patients at high risk of drug toxicity treated 
with this individualized high dose methotrexate protocol. 	
 
1.3 Hypothesis 
At least eighty percent of patients with a high risk for or past history of significant methotrexate toxicity, 
receiving 24-hour high-dose methotrexate infusions per this  institutional algorithm for individualized 
dosing will have an appropriately therapeutic but minimally toxic 24 hour methotrexate level between 
50-80µM.

6 2. BACKGROUND 
Methotrexate is a crucial chemotherapeutic agent used to treat children with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL), and is a staple of treatment regimens both nationally and internationally1.  In fact, 
cure rates for ALL approach 80%, in part due to the incorporation of methotrexate into treatment 
protocols1.  While all serum concentrations of methotrexate have shown to be efficacious in ALL 
therapy, when doses above 1g/m2 – considered high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) -  are given, 
several leukemic cell methotrexate resistance mechanisms are readily overcome2.  Most current 
protocols using HDMTX, including those run by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) now utilize 
5g/m2 given as a 24 hour infusion in non-Down syndrome leukemia patients3.  Many studies have 
demonstrated the clinical benefits of HDMTX4;5, even when directly compared to lower doses of 
methotrexate6.  Recent data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored COG trial AALL0232 
compared the effectiveness of HDMTX and 6-MP  against Capizzi escalating methotrexate plus PEG asparaginase (C-MTX/ASNase) in patients less than 30 years old with high-risk ALL (HR-ALL).  Initial 
analysis showed that patients randomized to receive HDMTX had significantly higher 5-year event-
free survival (EFS) compared to patients who receiv ed C-MTX/ASNase (82+ 3.4% versus 75.4 + 3.6%, 
p=0.006)
7.  This finding lead to all patients with HR-ALL being treated with HDMTX.   
 However, treatment with HDMTX can be associated wi th significant toxicity. The risk of morbidity and 
mortality from methotrexate toxicity increases when the drug is given at high dose.  Toxicities are directly correlated with increased drug exposure and since methotrexate is cleared renally, patients 
with kidney dysfunction are at part icularly high risk of complications
8.  In patients treated with HDMTX, 
1.8% will experience renal dysfunction9.  Patients with relapsed ALL are at increased risk of 
methotrexate toxicity due to prior exposure to nephrotoxic chemotherapy, as are patients with renal injury.  Per current COG protocols, patients with certain features indicating a high risk of toxicity to methotrexate will either have their methotrexate ar bitrarily reduced by 25%, or it will be omitted from 
their treatment regimen entirely reducing or eliminati ng the important anti-leukemic effects of the drug. 
 
2.1  Methotrexate Pharmacokinetics 
 
The pharmacokinetics of methotrexate vary greatly among patients, with a fixed dose resulting in a 7-
fold variation in the range of plasma concentration5.  This variability can also exist in individual 
patients on subsequent administrations of HDMTX5.  Therapeutic drug monitoring has thus become a 
standard part of protocols in patients receiving HDMTX.    
Typically pharmacokinetics of HDMTX are described using a two compartment model with four 
parameters (CL – clearance, V1 – central compartment volume of distribution, V2 peripheral compartment volume of distribution, and Q – intercompartmental clearance). Clearance (CL) of MTX ranges from 3.5-7.1 L/h, and is inversely proportional to the age of the patient.  Among patients with the same total bodyweight (TBW), MTX clearance was 30% higher in children less than 10 years when compared with children greater than 10 years of age.  The volume of distribution of central 
compartment (V
1) is 45% of TBW regardless of age10.   
 The variation in pharmacokinetics also has impo rtant clinical implications.  Prospective 
pharmacodynamic studies of patients with ALL receiving HDMTX have shown that those patients with median MTX plasma concentration at steady state (Cp
ss) less than 16µM had significantly lower rates 
of remaining in remissions compared to patients with Cp ss greater than 16µM5.

7 2.2  Polymorphisms 
 High-dose methotrexate administered as a 24 hour infusion is a standard therapy for patients with leukemia, types of lymphoma, and other malignancie s.  Though thousands of patients receive the 
same treatment, only a small subset will develop methotrexate toxicity.  This suggests that individual 
variations in methotrexate metabolism may c ontribute to the development of toxicities.   
 Previous studies have identified several functional polymorphisms in both the folate cycle and methotrexate transporters now thought to play a significant role in the large variation in 
pharmacokinetics, response, and toxicity seen in patients who receive HDMTX
11-13.  For example, the 
solute carrier 19A1 (SLC19A1, also known as reduced folate carrier 1, RLF1), is the main mechanism by which MTX enters the cell
14.  The expression of SLC19A1 correlates with intracellular MTX 
concentration.  Variations in the SLC19A1 gene have been shown to impact event-free survival15.  
The most common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SLC19A1  results in the substitution of Arg 
with His at position 27.  Recent data have shown that this SNP is also associated with HDMTX 
toxicity12.   
 Another example is found in individual variances in the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).  Once MTX is transported into the cell, it is metabolized to polyglutamylated metabolites.  These metabolites inhibit enzymes involved in the folic acid cycle, including MTHFR.  MTHFR plays 
an important role in the folic acid cycle as it is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of 5, 10-
methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
16.  A common cysteine to threonine substitution 
at MTHFR  677 results in lower enzyme activity and has been shown to be associated with decreased 
HDMTX clearance and increased toxicity12.  SNPs associated with SLCO1B1 , an organic anion 
transporter polypeptide, have also been shown be involved in MTX clearance13.   
 
2.3 Methotrexate Toxicity While integral to improving the survival of patients with malignancy, HDMTX can also result in severe 
treatment-related complications.  The main side-effects of HDMTX treatment include mucositis, hepatitis, renal dysfunction, prolonged myelosuppression, CNS toxicities such as seizures and stroke-like syndromes, and dermatitis
17;18.  In order to minimize these side effects, drug levels are closely 
monitored, and aggressive supportive care meas ures are standard practice.  During HDMTX 
infusions, hyper-hydration and alkalization of urine promote efficient clearance of the drug. The tetrahydrofolic acid derivative leucovorin is give n post-infusion to rescue normal DNA synthesis in non-
leukemia cells minimizing myelosuppression
19.  Leucovorin dosing is typically based on post infusion 
methotrexate concentrations and increased for slow methotrexate clearance.

8 2.3.1 Nephrotoxicity 
As methotrexate is excreted nearly exclusively by  the kidneys, methotrexate induced nephrotoxicity is 
a serious potential complication of treatment20.  The two main mechanisms of methotrexate induced 
nephrotoxicity involve damage to the renal tubules via either a direct toxic effect21 or as a result of the 
precipitation of methotrexate metabolites22;23.  The two main methotrexate metabolites, 7-hydroxy-
methotrexate (7-OH-MTX) and 2,4-diamino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA), are at least six times 
less soluble at acidic pH than methotrexate22;24.  This decreased solubility prompted alkalinization of 
the urine to be a major component of methotrexate supportive care.  In addition, alkalinization forces the ionization of methotrexate, a weak acid, making it more water soluble, preventing precipitation and 
trapping unchanged cleared methotrexate in urine for efficient elimination. 
In patients receiving HDMTX, 1.8% will experience renal dysfunction resultant from HDMTX.  This 
high risk group of patients has a mortality rate of 4.4%, greater than the mortality rate of 0.8% among patients who did not develop HDMTX induced renal dysfunction
9.   
 
2.3.2 Neurotoxicity 
 
Methotrexate toxicity can lead to severe neurological sequelae.  Among children treated with methotrexate, 3-11% will experience either transient or chronic symptoms of neurotoxicity such as: seizures, hemiparesis, aphasia, headache, and altered mental status
25.  However, up to 76% of 
patients treated with HDMTX demonstrate leukoencephalopathic changes on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI)26. The prevalence of leukoencephalopathy increases with each subsequent course of 
HDMTX.  Among patients who developed leukoencephalopathy following HDMTX, 10-56% had their symptoms recur when re-challenged with HDMTX
27-29.     
 
2.3.3 Other side effects 
 
Other common side effects of HDMTX include mucositis, hepatitis, and prolonged myelosuppression.  These side effects can result in hospital admission for management of symptoms, as well as a delay in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.  Increased ti me between chemotherapy cycles may contribute 
to inferior outcomes
30;31.  Delayed clearance of MTX is thought to contribute to the development of 
these side effects, as the time of exposure to MTX is prolonged19.   
 
2.3.4   Management of Toxicity 
 As methotrexate is primarily cleared via renal excr etion, patients with underlying renal dysfunction are 
at an increased risk of having delayed clearance.  The elevated and prolonged exposure to 
methotrexate that results from delayed clearance makes patients more susceptible to developing other 
drug related complications such as mucositis and myelosuppression
32.   
 In an effort to minimize the nephrotoxic effect of  HDMTX, patients concurrently receive leucovorin, 
hydration, and alkalinization
19.  If nephrotoxicity and delayed clearance develop despite these 
measures, two further options exist for lowering pl asma methotrexate concentrations: dialysis and 
glucarbidase  (CPDG 2).  After dialysis plasma MTX conc entrations decrease by a median of 52% 
(range 26-82%).  Cases of rebound increases in MTX plasma concentrations by 10-221% have been reported.  Patients are also subjected to the risks of dialysis including bleeding, infection, and electrolyte disturbances
8.  The total cost through hospital discharge for patients receiving dialysis can 
range from $94,000 to $140,00033.   
Protocol Version 8.0

9  
The enzyme CPDG 2, which hydrolyzes the terminal glutamate from naturally occurring folates and 
folate analogs such as methotrexate, is a well-tolerated alternative to lowering plasma MTX levels3.  
Within 15 minutes of administration, MTX plasma concentrations in patients with osteosarcoma, non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, or ALL decreased by a median of 98.7% (range 95.6-99.6%).  A rebound 
increase of 2.8-8.8% of the MTX concentration was seen in 60% of patients9.  The drug cost of 
CPDG 2 for a 50kg patient is approximately $30,000, excluding costs associated with preparation, 
administration, and pharmacy overhead (personal co mmunication, Brooke Bernhardt, PharmD, BCOP, 
COG pharmacist and clinical pharmacy specialist, Texas Children’s Cancer Center).  In addition, 
despite the fact that is recommended to consider CPDG2 in patients with sustained MTX 
concentrations of > 10 M at 42-48 hours after the start of a MTX infusion, it is currently a highly 
regulated, difficult to obtain medication8.  Although it is now commercially available, it requires special 
order from the manufacturer (http://www.btgplc.com/ products/specialty-pharmaceuticals/voraxaze).  
In addition, minimal dosing is kept available by most tertiary care hospitals.  Texas Children’s 
Hospital, for example, keeps four 1000 unit vials on site. This is enough for one time dosing for an 80kg patient (personal communication, Amanda Berger, PharmD, Texas Children’s Cancer Center).
   
  
There is currently no standardized method of administering HDMTX to patients at risk for increased 
methotrexate toxicity.  As a result, these patients are at risk of having HDMTX removed from their 
treatment regimen or suffering severe morbidity from its side-effects.  Current COG protocols suggest 
postponing and/or eventually omitting HDMTX administration for impaired renal function, grade 3-4 mucositis, hepatitis, and/or prolonged myelosuppression.  In patients who experience and fully recover from these effects, the current COG recommendations are to reduce subsequent doses of HDMTX.  As methotrexate metabolism varies widely among individuals, a fixed dose-reduction 
without respect for individual patient characteristics results in patients being at risk for either not 
reaching a therapeutic level of methotrexate or experiencing further drug-related side effects.   
 
2.4  Rationale for Treatment Design  The incorporation of HDMTX into treatment regimens for pediatric patients with ALL has improved cure 
rates now approaching 80%.  HDMTX has proven to be effective in treating ALL, regardless of 
prognostic factors such as age, immunophenotype, and genetics
1.  HDMTX is also effective at 
treating other malignancies such as Burkitt’s ly mphoma and mixed-phenotype leukemia, among others.  
Recent data from the NCI-sponsored COG clinical trial AALL0232 has shown that patients with HR-ALL have significantly improved EFS when tr eated with HDMTX/6-MP as compared to C-
MTX/ASNase
7.  As a result of this finding, patients with HR-ALL are no longer randomized to 
treatment during Interim Maintenance.  Instead, all patients who are able receive HDMTX during interim maintenance.  Every effort should thus be made to ensure that pati ents can safely receive HDMTX.  As effective as 
it is in treating leukemia, administration of HDMTX can result in serious side effects such as renal 
dysfunction, neurotoxicity, mucositis, prolonged my elosuppression, hepatitis, and dermatitis. The risk 
of methotrexate toxicity is increased in patients with impaired renal function.  Due to underlying medical conditions and prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, a subset of patients with ALL is at an increased risk of developing severe methotrexate-related toxicity.  There is currently no standardized method of administering HDMTX to patients at risk in increased methotrexate toxicity.  As a result, these 
patients are at risk of having HDMTX removed from their treatment regimen or suffering severe 
morbidity from its side-effects.    Prior studies, mostly at the St. Jude Children’ s Research Hospital (SJCRH) have shown that 
Protocol Version 8.0  
Date: June 17, 2015 
 
10 individualized methotrexate protocols can be safe and effective34;35.  Wall and colleagues used real-
time complex pharmacokinetic modeling to dose-adjust HDMTX in the treatment of patients with relapsed ALL.
36.  The group demonstrated that patients receiving HDMTX have an average clearance 
of 103ml/min/m2 34, which corresponded to a steady-state plasma concentration of (Cp ss) of 65µM + 
10µM at 24 hours35.  In addition, 58% of their patients required dose-adjustments to achieve a Cp ss 
within this range.  None of their patients experienced severe methotrexate-related toxicity.  They found that the initial methotrexate clearance was the best predictor of high methotrexate Cp
ss36.   
 Based largely on the previous work at SJCRH, we developed an individualized methotrexate treatment  
plan as an option to safely administer HDMTX, with a target Cpss of 65 M to patients at risk for 
delayed clearance and subsequent toxicity.  Other options for this population would include a 25% methotrexate dose reduction or complete omission of HDMTX from their treatment.  Since 2007, Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH) has given patients with past history of toxicities including renal 
toxicities individualized methotrexate with no known increase in toxicities based on evolving versions 
of this treatment plan (n =14 patients; ref: personal communications with faculty members of the Texas Children’s Hospital Leukemia Program).  Work by Aumente, et al, demonstrated that the Monte Carlo 
simulated MTX concentration and means over time show a peak methotrexate concentration near hour 2, with steady state occurring near hour 6
10. Therefore, our treatment plan provides guidelines for 
HDMTX dose adjustments based on hour 2 and 6 methotrexate levels.  In addition, these 
adjustments are based on a fixed, simple bed-side algorithm and thus avoid the need for complex 
pharmacokinetic modeling.    Patients treated according to the algorithm may thus not need their dose altered.  With this in mind, in addition to our eligibility criteria we will allow attendings to enroll patients as they deem necessary, since if the MTX Cp
ss is therapeutic no alterations to therapy will be 
made.  In September, 2012, this treatment plan wa s formalized and approved for clinical use by the 
Texas Children’s Cancer Center Chemotherapy Safety Committee.   
 In addition, despite the fact that MTX pharmacokinetics, tumor response and patient toxicities are known to vary greatly and it is known that several germline polymorphisms play a role in this variation, 
much controversy about the functional cons equences of these polymorphisms still exists
11.  Our study, 
will, by definition, isolate a population of patients with a known increased propensity for certain MTX 
toxicities.  Because the general population minor a llele frequency (MAF) is known for many of the 
polymorphisms known to affect MTX metabolism, this study will provide a unique opportunity to compare rates of certain of these polymorphisms in our study population to that of the general population.  This may help elucidate which polymorphisms truly correlate to deficiencies in MTX metabolism.  In addition, we may be able to discover which polymorphisms describe a population 
best suited for individualized MTX dosing.      
 Though many genetic targets in the folate cycle and intracellular MTX transportation have already 
been identified, new target genes continue to be discovered.  Given that the knowledge base in this field is rapidly expanding, the decision of which polymorphisms to be tested will be determined at the 
time of analysis, when the study accrual has been met.  Common SNPs currently thought to be 
involved in methotrexate metabolism, pharmacodynamics and toxicity are listed below:

This research does not qualify for an IND as the use of HDMTX is per standard of care treatment of ALL, and the route of administration or dosage level does not significantly increase risk to the patient.

Subjects will come off protocol therapy for infusion delays longer than 2 hours.  In addition, the total methotrexate infusion time, on this study, should be no longer than 26 hours.  Infusions should only 
be extended past 24 hours to accommodate stops for other med infusions.  Increases in rate of MTX 
infusion to ensure completion within this time frame are not allowed. 
 
The interventions in this protocol occur at the 2 and 6 hour (or 8 hour if the 2 hour level was ≥100µM) 
time points.  After the 24hr HDMTX infusion is complete, the individualized protocol will end and patients will remain on study but be off of the protocol therapy.  After this time, management of MTX levels will continue according the treating physician’s discretion using standard supportive care 
guidelines.  This is elaborated below in Appendix B, suggested supportive care guidelines based on 
the COG algorithm. Interventions for toxicity are at the discretion of the treating provider as patients 
will be off treatment protocol at the 24hr time point. Glucarpidase should be administered based on the treating physician’s discretion, with the recommendation that it be administered prior to the development of grade 4 nephrotoxicity and prior to 96 hours after the start of the HDMTX infusion.  
Administration of CPDG
2 after these time points have been shown to be statistically associated with 
the development of ≥ grade 4 toxicity3. 
  Patients may be re-enrolled on this protocol therapy again for subsequent HDMTX infusions without 
the need for re-consent. In order to re-enroll, call the study coordinating center as outlined in Section 
3.1 PRIOR to the cycle in which the dose modification protocol will be implemented.  The active length of study participation for each patient is 4 weeks after the last high-dose methotrexate infusion or until the next cycle of chemotherapy begins (which ever occurs first).  
Therefore, the maximum amount of active time on study would be 2.5 months.  This would include 4 
doses of HDMTX given every other week plus a 4 week follow-up period to assess for side effects. 
  
4.2 Study Endpoints After the initial monitoring of MTX levels and creatinine during the MTX infusion, patients will be 
followed for the development of HDMTX related toxicity for 4 weeks after their infusion or until their 
next cycle of chemotherapy begins , whichever is shorter.

15 5. EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED 
At Study Entry 5.1 Physical Exam 5.2 Laboratory Tests Prior to Treatment 
 A maximum of 28 days prior to the first dose of HDMTX on this protocol a nuclear 
medicine GFR must be performed.  
 A maximum of 7 days prior to the first dose of HDMTX on this protocol the following labs 
will be collected (Week 0 labs): CBC, Chem 10, AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin, and 
10 mL in a purple top (minimum of 5mL will be accepted) of additional blood for MTX transportation genetic analysis.  Sample for MTX transportation genetic analysis is optional. 
 
5.3    Demographic information 
 
Age, race, leukemia type, cytogenetics of leukemia , leukemia risk stratification, disease status, 
protocol treated according to, concomitant medication, reason for enrollment on protocol and type of adverse event with prior HDMTX. 
5.4 Laboratory Tests During Treatment 
 Methotrexate levels and creatinine at times 2, 6 (or 8) and 24 hours are required for 
research purposes.  Additional methotrexate levels and creatinine should be performed 
per institutional standards.  Methotrexate levels and creatinine at hours 36 (if 
methotrexate levels are ≥150 micromolar), 42, 48 and every 6-12 hours thereafter until 
methotrexate is considered cleared (e.g. ≤0.4 micromolar at hour 48 and/or <0.1 
micromolar thereafter) is highly recommended but considered optional.  An example of routine post-methotrexate monitoring is outlined in Appendix B.  
 The following labs should be drawn at Week 1 and Week 2 and repeated weekly until 
either the next dose of HDMTX is administered or 4 weeks have passed since the last 
dose of HDMTX: CBC, Creatinine, BUN, AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin. 
 
5.5 Host Polymorphisms  The literature on SNPs influencing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methotrexate is rapidly evolving
11.  Based on current knowledge, at minimum we will assay each participant who 
consents for the SLC19A1 80G>A, TYMS 28-bp triple repeat, MTHFR 677C>T and MTHFR 1298A>C 
SNPs.  In addition, technologies for genotype analysis are constantly changing and improving.  However, for the above SNPs multiple technologies have been discovered and validated
12. Our 
samples will be batched, and the most appropriate technique for genotyping at the time of analysis will be performed.  Our collaborator, Dr. Donald W. (Will) Parsons has vast expertise in various 
genotyping methods including TaqMan, restriction enzyme, and Sanger sequencing.   
 
5.5.1 Genotyping Methods More than one genotyping technique may need to be used for different samples.  Dr. Parsons’ lab has experience in this field, and will be able to perform the necessary technique to achieve reproducibility in all samples.  When choosing a method we will consider, cost, amount of DNA 
Protocol Version 8.0  
Date: June 17, 2015 
 
16 needed, and availability of technique. 
 5.5.2 DNA Extraction and Distribution Five to 10 mL of peripheral blood will be collected for genotyping purposes prior to the initiation of 
the methotrexate infusion, during the gathering of additional baseline laboratories.  At this time 
additional baseline labs are routinely collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be optimally present prior to methotrexate/chem otherapy induced myelosuppression.  Mononuclear 
cells will be separated from whole blood using Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation.  DNA will be isolated from the enriched mononuclear cells using the QIAgen DNeasy kit per the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  To avoid DNA loss or degradation DNA samples will be stored in Axygen or 
comparable tubes.  Based on prior experience with ALL samples, we expect an average of 18.5mcg of DNA per sample.  Most current genotyping techniques require 5-20ng per assay.   
 5.6    Other information to be collected 
 
 Ordered HDMTX dose 
 date/time of 24hr infusion start 
 initial HDMT infusion rate with HDMTX concentration 
 date/time of each change in HDMTX infusion rate and rate at which new infusion is set (if 
applicable) 
 date/time of 24hr infusion start and stop for concomitant medications 
 date/time of completion of HDMTX infusion 
 toxicities experienced during infusion,  
 hour at completion of monitoring 
 total MTX given 
 total leucovorin given 
 all MTX levels resulted and time each MTX level was drawn. 
 
  
5.7 After Treatment Adverse effects 
 Toxicities will be assessed until the next cycle of chemotherapy is administered or until 4 weeks after 
the administration of HDMTX, whichever time period is shorter.  Each grade >3 adverse event will be 
collected for the following methotrexate related toxicities: mucositis, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity (AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin).  All adverse events will be collected for neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.  
If multiple occurrences of a toxicity take place during a single course, please list a separate Max 
Grade This Occurrence for each occurrence.  The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6(R1) defines an adverse event (AE) as: 
 “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or 
not considered related to the medicinal product.” 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that: 1.  Results in death; 2.  Is immediately life threatening; 3.  Results in hospitalization – either initial or prolonged; 4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 5.  Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect; 6.  Results in required intervention to prevent permanent impairm ent or damage or 7.  Results in another serious 
Protocol Version 8.0  
Date: June 17, 2015 
 
17 important medical event. 
 For the purposes of this study, it is not required to report SAEs which result in admissions to the hospital for simple febrile neutropenia or prolongation of a hospitalization secondary to delayed 
methotrexate clearance. 
 All SAEs should be identified and reported lo cally per institutional standards.  
 All unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (UPIRSOs) should be identified and 
reported locally per institutional standards. 
 All reportable AEs and SAEs recorded during this study will be summarized.  The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by primary system 
organ class, severity based on CTCAE, version 4. 0, type of adverse event and relationship to 
methotrexate.  Deaths reportable as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and non-fatal SAEs will be listed 
by patient and tabulated by primary system or gan class and type of adverse event.  Any other 
information collected (e.g. start/end dates and duration of AE, severity or relatedness to methotrexate) will be listed as appropriate.  All reportable SAEs and UPIRSOs should be reported to the Principal Investigator Jennifer Foster at 
jhfoster@txch.org  and the Research Coordinator Kathy McCarthy at ksmccart@texaschildrens.org  
within 5 business days.

18 7. CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL  THERAPY AND OFF STUDY CRITERIA  
7.1 Removal from Protocol Therapy 
7.1.1 > Grade 3 renal or neurologic toxicity 
7.1.2 Parent/patient or provider request  
7.1.3 Inability to analyze methotrexate levels at given time points.  Patients will come off of 
study secondary to the inability to make dose modification decisions if methotrexate levels at required time points are not available within 120 minutes of drawing the level.  If this occurs, treatment decisions will be up to the treating physician.  Options would include: discontinuing the methotrexate infusion, altogether or calculating a 25% total 
dose reduction (as suggested by COG) and stopping the infusion when the total dose 
given reaches the newly calculated reduced dose. 
7.1.4 Methotrexate infusion interrupted for longer than 2 hours. 
 
7.2 Off Study Criteria 
7.2.1 Lost to follow-up 7.2.2 4 weeks after the end of methotrexate infusion or start of next chemotherapy, which ever is 
shorter. 
 
7.2.3 Death 
 8. Data Monitoring 
 
Texas Children’s Cancer Center, where we will be conducting our research, is part of the Dan L. 
Duncan Cancer Center (DLDCC).  The NCI-designated Dan L. Duncan Cancer Center at Baylor 
College of Medicine is a consortium made up of several institutions across the Texas Medical Center.  As part of the DLDCC, we will have access to various shared resources, including a Clinical Trials Support Unit.  For our data monitoring, we will utilize the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) through the DLDCC. 
 
8.1. Stopping rules 
8.1.1. Two patients with HDMTX induced nephropathy necessitating dialysis or administration 
of carboxypeptidase. 
8.1.2. Two patients achieving a 24 hour Cp
ss of <20µM. 
8.1.3. Two patients needing intensive care admission for HDMTX related toxicities. 
8.1.4. Any death attributed to HDMTX toxicity. 
 If any of the above criteria are met then the study will be stopped, the incident(s) will be reviewed, and the study will be amended to address the incident(s) prior to potentially re-opening. 
9. Statistical Considerations 9.1 Statistical Design 
Aim 1 1a) Calculate the incidence of success with the new protocol (achieving an end infusion 
Protocol Version 8.0  
Date: June 17, 2015 
 
19 peripheral blood MTX concentration between 50-80 μM) 
 1b) Explore potential changes in incidence of success (achieving an end infusion peripheral blood MTX concentration between 50-80 μM) between sequential administrations of HDMTX.  The 
primary endpoint and sample size calculation refer to the first cycle for each patient. 
 
Aim 2 2a) Calculate the frequency of adverse effects after each infusion.  Success rate over multiple cycles within individual patients will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations for binary outcomes. This method will also be applied to the frequency of adverse events and to the assessment of factors associated with outcome. Continuous and ordinal/non-normal adverse effects will be 
compared via paired t-test or Wilcox sign rank test respectively. 
 2b) Describe the genotype of various methotrexate metabolizing SNPs in each subject.  The polymorphisms of subjects in this study will be compared to published minor allele frequencies and when appropriate will be stratified by race/ethnicity.  The purpose of this analysis will be to describe trends away from the major allele frequency in pati ents known to either have experienced or who are 
at high risk for developing adverse effects to HDMTX.   
 2c) Examine predictors of success of achieving a CP
ss of 50-80 μM.  Variables in our analysis 
will include (but not be limited to) age, sex, disease type, race/ethnicity and measure of pre-MTX renal function.  An analysis both with and without SNP genotype will be performed secondary to the likelihood that race/SNP correlations will interfere with SNPs being a truly independent variable.  We will initially use chi-square test for group variables and t-test for continuous variables.  Logistic 
regression will be used for multivariable analysis to control for confounders and estimation of adjusted 
odds ratios.  P<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.       
 
 
9.2 Patient Accrual and Expected Duration of Trial 
Patients will be continually accrued until a target of 50 methotrexate infusions requiring any protocol-
prescribed dose adjustments are reached.  The expected duration of accrual for the trial is 2-2.5 years. 
9.3 Statistical Analysis Methods 
Sample size with power justification:  
 
Sample size is estimated on primary study objective of estimating the true rate of success with the new protocol. Success is defined as 80% of infusions achieving 24hr HDMTX end infusion MTX values of 50-80µM.  A sample size of 50 methotrexate infusions per the algorithm produces a two-
sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 0.22 when the sample proportion is 80%. We will 
be 95% confident that the true success rate in the study would be between 69% and 91%.  Analysis:  Aim 1a) Overall change in the incidence of success with the new protocol (achieving end infusion MTX levels 50-80µM) and 
1b) change in incidence of success at various infusion times during interim maintenance and 
interim maintenance-like cycles in which patients are administered HDMTX every 2 weeks, as well as  
1c) Success rate over multiple cycles within individual patients will be analyzed using generalized 
estimating equations for binary outcomes. This method will also be applied to the frequency of adverse events and to the assessment of factors associated with outcome. Continuous and 
ordinal/non-normal adverse effects will be compared via paired t-test or wilcox sign rank test 
respectively.    Aim 2) To examine predictors of success (achieving CP
ss of 50-80µM) we will initially use chi-square 
Protocol Version 8.0  
Date: June 17, 2015 
 
20 test for grouped variable and t-test for continuous variables. Logistic regression will be used for 
multivariable analysis to control for confounders and estimation of adjusted odds ratios. P<.05 will be considered statistically significant.

Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 5 of 31 3 Background /Rationale  & Purpose  
 
3.1 Background Information  
 
Glaucoma is a disease characterized by an increase d intraocular pressure, resulting in damage to optic 
nerve.5 This disease can be diagnosed by measurin g visual field loss , identifying  other changes in the 
physical structures of the eye and by measuring IOP. If untreated, glaucoma can result in preventable 
vision loss.5 
 
Glaucoma is commonly treated with prescription eye drops.2,4 It is critical that pati ents receive  the correct 
dose and frequency of eye drop medication as prescribed.2,4,5 This will prevent disease advancement and 
decrease the chances of vision loss.5 However,  patient compliance with medication limits symptom 
improvement  due to deliber ate misuse , financial concerns, or unintentional issues in drug delivery.3 Some  
patients have difficulty putting in the correct amount of eye drops themselves.4 Common problems are 
from a patient missing their eye, delivering too much medication, or  they are unable to squeeze the bottle 
properly. This can create further problems with pharmacy refills, as well as financially from buying an 
increased number of prescriptions.3 In order to ensure patients are receiving the correct amount of drops 
with ea ch use, drop aids are available at local pharmacies for purchase.4 These are not commonly 
recommended because they can be costly and their usefulness has not yet been proven.2,4 Although if a 
drop aid proves to be effective, they may result in a  decrease of cost for the patient in the long term  by 
allowing a decrease in premature completion of the bottle.3, 4   
 
This study aims to determine the efficacy of  glaucoma drop aids delivery of ophthalmic medications by 
improving medication compliance, visual funct ion, and decreasing medication waste in the patient 
population at BMC.  
 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, applicable regulatory requirements, and 
BMC/BU Medical Campus Human Research Protection policies and procedures.  
 
3.2 Rationa le and Purpose  
 
The ophthalmology department at Boston Medical Center sees on average 275 glaucoma patients weekly, 
80 percent of which are placed on glaucoma medications. It is critical for these patients to receive the 
correct dose and frequency of thei r eye drops, in order to prevent disease advancement and decrease the 
chances of vision loss.4 However, a  majority of patients are unable to properly deliver the eye drops into 
their eyes due to poor vision or difficulty squeezing drop bottles. 3,4 Further more, when patients are able 
to instill drops into their eyes, they often deliver more than a necessary amount, leading to premature 
completion of the bottle. This is an issue in the United States, as most glaucoma patients are on 2  to 3 
different medicati on drops and Medicare Part D sponsors permit refills at only 70% of predicated days of 
use, accounting for about half of glaucoma patient population.1 Self-reported studies also showed that 
approximately 25% of patients reported problems with early exhaust ion of eye drop bottles.1 The average 
size of a glaucoma medication bottle is around 10  cc and these medications, when used 2  to 3 times daily, 
are expected to last patients an entire month.  When used in excess or reduction, problems may occur with 
pharma cy refills, an addition to financial burdens from buying an increased number of prescription 
refills.1 In the absence of good medication compliance and response, patients often have to undergo costly 
surgical procedures that can place them at an increased risk of infection and loss of vision, while still 
requiring postoperative management with ophthalmic drops, in addition to being closely monitored by 
eye care providers.1  
 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 6 of 31 In order to ensure patients are receiving the correct amount of drops with each use , there are many drop 
aid assistive devices available for purchase on the market; however, these drop aids are not routinely 
offer ed to our patients because of their unproven cost benefit ratio, and the poorly studied efficacy of the 
devices.4 Although, if  a drop aid proves to be effective, the cost of the drop aid devices would more than 
pay themselves through the improvement in medication compliance and visual function of our patients. 
The “Glaucoma Drop Aid Study” aims to determine if using drop aids dur ing the administration of eye 
drop medication leads to better results for patients with glaucoma at Boston Medical Center. The 
implications of this study may show an improved delivery system of ophthalmic medications thus 
improving medication compliance, v isual function, and even decreasing medication waste.  
 
4 Objectives  
 
4.1 Study Objectives  
 
The primary objective of this study is to compare efficiency of various drop aids for glaucoma 
medications objectively via changes in intraocular pressure. The different d rop aids that are utilized are 
the Simply Touch Eye Drop Applicator, the Fabrication Autodrop Eye Drop Guide, and the Owen 
Mumford OP 6100 Autosqueeze . The central hypothesis is that the use of a  drop aid  device  increase s 
efficiency of glaucoma medication when comparing changes in intraocular pressure.  
 
A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate how often a patient missed their eye when instilling 
drops  with various drop aids in order to assess whether drop aids can decrease medication waste, increa se 
medication compliance,  and improve visual function . Additionally, the study will analyze how satisfied 
the patient is with their drop aid and the likelihood they would contin ue to use one outside of the study.  
These satisfaction means will be evaluated with a patient satisfaction survey approximately 3 weeks and 6 
weeks after enrollment.  
 
4.2 Study Outcome Measures  
 
The efficiency of various drop aids will be measured through the  subject’s glaucoma progression at the 
end of the study. On the day of enrollment, the subject’s IOP and visual acuity will be measured as part of 
their standard of care exam. This information is recorded as the baseline exam, and will be compared to 
measu re the patient’s glaucoma progression at the end of the study. Subjects will be  required to record the 
date on which they beg an each of their glaucoma eye drop bottles, and the date each bottle was finished  in 
a study diary provided by the research team. Subject’s satisfaction will be measured through a brief 
satisfaction survey approximately 3  weeks after their enrollment.  After at least 6 weeks of study 
participation, subject will be followed up with their regularly scheduled glaucoma provider  where they  
will fill out a second  brief satisfaction survey. The s tudy diary will be collected and a routine eye exam 
will be  conducted, with their IOP checked as part of a standard of care clinic visit.  
 
All surveys were created by a member of the research team. T he satisfaction survey includes five 
questions to assess the precision  of the drop aid device , overall patient  satisfaction , and willingness to use 
the device long term. The questions are multiple choice questions in which the patient circles the answer 
that best reflects their response.

 Primary Outcome Measure s 
 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 7 of 31 The objective of this study is to compare efficiency of various drop aids for glaucoma medications 
objectively via changes i n intraocular pressure.  
 
 Secondary Outcome Measur es 
 
The following secondary outcomes will also be measured:  
1. Number of times a patient missed their eye when instilling eye drops  
2. Patient satisfaction responses with treatment arms  
3. Intention to use a drop ai d long term  
 
5 Study Design  
 
This interventional clinical trial is a prospective, single center, randomized controlled study. Patients 
being treated for their glaucoma at BMC's Yawkey Eye Clinic will be selected.  Patients will be randomly 
placed, without man ipulations by the principle investigator or any member of the research team, on one of 
the drop aid devices (including Fabrication Autodrop Eye Drop Guide, Simply Touch Eye Drop 
Applicator, Owen Mumford OP 6100 Autosqueeze), in addition to a no drop aid co ntrol, for a total of 4 
groups.  
 
Subjects have an equal chance of being randomized to one of the following study arms:  
 Arm A: No intervention – Control  
 Arm B: Active Comparator - Eye Drop Aids  Including:  
o Simply Touch Eye Drop Applicator  
o Fabrication Autodrop  Eye Drop Guide  
o Owen Mumford OP 6100 Autosqueeze  
 
The primary endpoint is the comparison of baseline IOP measurement and follow -up IOP measurement. 
This comparison will determine the efficacy of using a drop aid. The secondary endpoints include the 
precisi on of the drop aid, patient satisfaction, and their likelihood to use a drop aid outside of the study. 
Data collection for assessment of study objectives will be obtained via standard of care clinic visits and 
completion of study diary and satisfaction sur vey by the patient with assistance of research team, if 
needed.  
 
See the Appendix  section 15.1  for a schematic of the study design  and section 15.3 for drop aid labels and 
instructions .  
 
6 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
6.1 Risks  
 
Risks and possible discomforts involved with study participation are associated with eye dropper use and 
the possibility of a breach of confidentiality. The use of the assigned drop aid does not pose any 
additional risk to subjects from only using an eye drop bottle for administration. Both methods of eye 
drop administration pose the same risk of corneal abrasion or infection from poking the eye with the 
device/bottle, or using a dirty device/bottle. Subjects will be advised by the investigator on how to 
decrease these risks when adminis tering drops with the assigned device.  
 
There is the unlikely possibility of breach of confidentiality. Confidentiality will be protected as stated in 
Section 11.1 of this protocol.  
6.2 Unknown Risks  
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 8 of 31  
There may be unknown risks or discomfors involved. Study staff will update all subjects in a timeley 
manner with any new information that may affect their health, welfare, or deci sion to participate in this 
study.  
 
6.3 Potential Benefits  
 
Study participants may benefit from participation by improved eye drop compliance, decrease in 
medication refill requirements, receiving a drop aid at no cost, and an overall increased satisfaction w ith 
eye drop medications. It is also possible that subjects may not receive any direct benefit from 
participation, but  they will be helping investigators learn about the benefits of drop aids  as well as better 
understand the efficacy of its usage for pat ients at BMC.  
 
6.4 Analysis of Ris ks in R elation to Benefits  
 
The project allows for potential improvement  in patient s’ medication compliance. These drop aids are 
designed to help deliver only the necessary amount of medication and target the eye to allow for easier  
delivery of medications.  The drop aids involved in this study are targeted toward improving patient 
experience  when using glaucoma medications. This may reduce patient frustration and increase adherence 
to medication allowing for better  glaucoma  treatment outcomes . The risks of this study include a minimal 
risk of loss of confidentially. The risk is minimal in comparison to the potential benefits of: improved 
medication compliance, monetary benefits of decreased number of refills, increased patie nt satisfaction  
with eye drop medications, and community benefit of understanding the effectiveness of drop aids.

Drop Aid devices were funded by a Boston Medical Center grant award. Devices were purchased by the 
grant award at no cost to the patients. Drop aid devices will be ordered online using the funds provided by 
the grant award. Upon arrival to Boston Medical Center, drop aid devices will be stored in locked 
cabinets that only the research team can access. Each drop aid will have a study -speci fic label indicating it 
is an investigational device provided by BMC. Administration of the drop aid devices will occur after 
consenting procedures and randomization to a treatment or control arm.  Patients will be instructed by a 
member of the research tea m how to use the device. Patients will be expected to use the device each time 
they administer their eye drops as directed by their provider.   
 
Compliance to drop aid device will be assessed via patient satisfaction surveys. Patient satisfaction 
surveys a sk the participant to confirm the usage of drop aid device after administration of device at the 3 
week phone call and 6 week follow -up.

10 Assessment of Safety  and Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
The following definitions will be used in the assessment of safety:  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related t o 
the subject’s participation in the research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any adverse event that  
(1) results in death;  
(2) is life -threatening;  
(3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
(4) results in a persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity;  
(5) results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
(6) based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject's health and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this  definition 
(examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or dru g abuse).  
 
Life-threatening  means that the event places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred.  
 
Unanticipated Problem  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following criteria:  
 is unexpec ted; AND  
 is related or possibly related  to participation in the research; AND  
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk  of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recogniz ed.  
 
Possibly related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by the procedures involved in the research  
 
Unexpected means  the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent wit h either:  
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 12 of 31  the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in (a) the protocol –related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, an d the current IRB -approved informed 
consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts; or  
 the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) 
exper iencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse 
event.  
 
10.2 Safety Review  
 
Both the risks listed in Section 6.1 and unknown risks will be monitored throughout this minimal risk 
study. The PI will have overall respon sibility for the study. The PI will review all AEs, SAEs, and UPs. 
During the review, the PI will complete the form designated in Appendix  15.4.1 in which the AE will be 
graded and the relatedness will be determined. All SAEs and UPs will be promptly repor ted to the BUMC 
IRB as designated in Section 10.3. The SAE Report demonstrated in Appendix Section  15.4.2 will be 
completed for all SAEs and UPs.      
  
Dr. Manishi Desai is the PI and will be responsible  for th e study. Dr. Desai will be notified within 1 week 
of any events determined an AE or SAE and 2 days of any event determined a UP. Dr. Desai  will review 
all AEs/SAEs within 2 weeks and all UPs within 5 days. After this review, any recommended changes 
will be  made to the PI and the co -investigators in addition to the BUMC IRB as deemed necessary by the 
PI.

11 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
 
11.1 Confidentiality  
 
The clinical research staff in the Department of Ophthalmology at BMC ha s sole accessibility to view 
patient identifiers for eligibility review. After the patient is consented into the study, each patient will 
receive a unique  study  ID number to protect subject identity. Subject identifiers and study  ID numbers 
will be linked in a secure, password -protected master database located in a departmental networked 
serves, housed behind BMC’s firewall. The  master database will allow f or subject re -identification, as 
necessary, for strict research -specific purposes. Only study personnel will have access to the master 
database.  
 
Any paper records related to this study will be stored in locked cabinets or in a locked office. Any 
data that  is analyzed by an outside source will not contain any identifiers. In the event that any 
information is stored on external storage, the data will be encrypted. Patient information will not be 
used in any other way than described in this protocol.  
 
A desc ription of this clinical trial will be available on http://clinicaltrials.gov, as required by U.S. 
Law. The website will not include information which can identify any of the subjects. At most, the 
website will include a summary of the results. The subject  is able to search for the study at any time 
on the website by utilizing the ClinicalTrials.gov number shown on the first page of this protocol.  
 
11.2 Source Documents  
 
All source documents for this study will include the electronic medical record and the study -specific 
documents which includes the following:  
 CRFs in Appendix section 15.2 
 Patient Satisfaction Survey Appendix section 15.2.4  
 AE, SAE, and UP tracking  report s in Appendix section 15.4 
 
Data generated by the methods described in the protocol may be recorded in the subjects' medical records 
and/or study progress notes. Data may be transcribed legibly on CRFs supplied for each subject or 
directly inputted into an electronic system or any combination thereof.  
 
11.3 Case Report Forms  
 
The study case report for m (CRF) will be  the primary data collec tion instrument for the study. All data 
requeste d on the CRF will be recorded. All m issing data will be explained. If a space on the CRF is left 
blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, “N/D”  will be written. If the 
item is not applicable to the individual case, “N/A”  will be written.  All entries will be printed legibly in 
black ink. If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, a single straight line will be drawn 
through t he incorrect entry and the correct data will be entered above it. All such changes will be initialed 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 14 of 31 and dated.  There will be no erasures or white -out on CRFs .  For clarification of illegible or uncertain 
entries, the clarification will be printed above t he item, then i nitial ed and date d.  
 
See the Appendix  section 15.2  for the following CRFs: Eligibility Assessment Form, Documentation of 
Informed Consent, Home Study Diary, and the Satisfaction Survey.  
 
11.4 Study Records Retention  
 
In accordance with BMC polic y, the study records will be retained for at least seven years after 
completion of the study. Additionally, as required by the BMC/ BUMC IRB, documentation of informed 
consent of subjects will be retained for at least three years after the study is closed.  All of the required 
records may be preserved in hard copy, electronic, or other media form and must be accessible for 
inspection and copying by authorized individuals.  
 
12 Statistical Plan 
 
12.1 Study Hypotheses  
 
12.1.1. Primary Objective: Intraocular Pressure  
 
Formal hypothesis: Drop aids will be cost -effective in delivery of ophthalmic medications by improving  
baseline IOP measures to six week visit .  
 
Testable h ypothesis: Patient baseline IOP measures will  be a statistically significantly  improve ment  in 
accord ance to the usage of a drop aid device.   
 
Null h ypothesis: The patient s, who are assigned to a drop aid device baseline IOP measures will not have 
a statistically  significant change with the usage of a drop aid device when compared to patients not 
assigne d to a drop aid device.  
 
Alternate hypothesis: Patients not assigned to a drop aid device will result in larger significant change 
when compared to patients who are assigned to a drop aid device.  
    H0: µ0  <  µd – δ 
    HA: µ0  ≥  µ d – δ 
 
Where µ0, is the true mean IOP change from baseline to the six week visit without the drop aid device, µ d 
is the true mean IOP change from baseline to the six week visit with the drop aid device.  
 
12.1.2. Secondary Objective: Drop s Missed  
 
Formal hypothesis:  Drop aids will be effective in delivering the proper amount of drops , thereby  reducing 
the number of missed drops for patients.  
 
Testable hypothesis: Differences in drops missed with drop aid device compared to without  drop aid 
device will show efficacy in drop aid device.  
 
Null hypothesis: Patients assigned to a drop aid device will not result in less drops missed when compared 
to patients who are not assigned to a drop aid device.  
 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 15 of 31 Alternate hypothesis: Patients assigned  to a drop aid device will result in minimal missed drops when 
compared to patients who are not assigned to a drop aid device.  
 
12.1.3. Secondary Objective: Patient Satisfaction  
 
Formal hypothesis:  Drop aid devices will prove greater patient satisfaction than administrations without a 
drop aid device.  
 
Testable hypothesis: Mean patient satisfaction to those assigned to a drop aid device compared to mean 
patient satisfaction scores to those not assigned to a drop aid device.  
 
Null hypothesis: Patients ass igned to a drop aid device will not show greater patient satisfaction than 
patients not assigned to a drop aid device.  
 
Alternate hypothesis: Patients assigned to a drop aid device will show greater patient satisfaction than 
patients not assigned to a dro p aid device.  
H0: µ s  <  µsd – δ 
    HA: µ s  ≥  µsd – δ 
 
Where µs, is the mean patient satisfaction without the drop aid device, µ sd is the mean patient satisfaction 
with the drop aid device.  
 
12.1.4. Secondary Objective:  Intention of  Long term use  
 
Formal hypothesis:  Patients assi gned to a drop aid device will claim greater interest in long term use of 
the drop aid device, than declining long term use of the drop aid device . 
 
Testable hypothesis: Mean patient s claiming interest in long term use of the drop aid device compared to 
mean patient declining interest in long term use of the drop aid device.  
 
Null hypothesis: Patients assigned to a drop aid device will not show greater mean interest in long term 
use of the drop aid device.  
 
Alternate hypothesis: Patients assigned to a drop  aid device will show greater mean interest in long term 
use of the drop aid device.  
H0: µ y  <  µ n – δ 
    HA: µ y  ≥  µ n – δ 
 
Where µy, is the mean patients who claimed interest in long term use of the device, µ n is the mean patient 
who denied interest in  long term use of the device.  
 
12.2 Sample Size Determination  
 
The sample size was determined by the maximum number of subjects which could be randomized given 
the budgetary constraints of the grant funding. It was determined that a total of ten patients per g roup was 
financially feasible, thus a total of 40 patients will be enrolled in this study in approximately 1 year.  
 
Enrolling the projected 40 subjects in 1 year is feasible , as the ophthalmology department sees 
approximately 275 glaucoma patients weekly. Due to the high volume of the  glaucoma  clinic, the study 
team should be able to easily recruit their target. Additionally, the study team is comprised of multiple 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 16 of 31 investigators and research assistants who have been delegated tasks on this protocol which ca n provide 
full-time recruitment coverage.    
 
12.3 Statistical Methods  
 
A variety of statistical analysis will be used to analyze the results. A paired t -test will be the primary 
method of analysis. Any significant differences measured will be between the pre a nd post intervention, 
with the patient serving as their own control. However, the analysis will not be limited to a paired t -test 
and will also likely include ANOVA, chi -squared, p -value, linear regression, among others.   Other 
outcomes such as length of t ime until completion of drops will also be measured and compared to no drop 
aid controls. Significant differences will be measured with similar statistical analysis as stated previously. 
Satisfaction of use will be measured with a survey and results will b e averaged among those in the same 
cohort. Any significant differences will also be measured with similar statistical analysis stated 
previously.  
 
13 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects

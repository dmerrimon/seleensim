Study Protocol
Clinical Study Description 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) on prosocial behavior and emotional regulation, 
both during and after AAT sessions, in children referred for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) evaluation or documented 
developmental delay (DD) or behavioral concerns. We seek to address identified gaps in knowledge of the use of canines in therapy 
sessions by analyzing short- and long-term effects of AAT and human-animal interaction occurring in AAT sessions. Caregivers were 
given the option to enroll the child in the AAT study at the follow-up appointment after the diagnostic assessment was completed, or 
upon enrollment in the ASD program if the child had an ASD diagnosis. Each AAT study lasted between eight to 12 weeks, and 
caregivers had the option to re-enroll the child for the next study to continue addressing behavioral concerns. Animal-assisted therapy 
sessions lasted 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the age and ability of the participant. Sessions started with five to 10 minutes of free 
play with the canine, followed by sensory integration therapy based on the child’s identified sensory profile. Participants then entered 
the clinic room for 20 to 30 minutes of a seated activity in which the therapist, a certified pediatric nurse practitioner (CPNP), taught 
coping and socialization strategies to participants and caregivers. Sessions concluded with five minutes of play with the canine. Play 
activities include fetch, soccer, hide and seek, and puzzles. The canine was trained to lay under the table in the clinic room while the 
therapist was working with the participants. He would provide grounding, light pressure, and deep pressure therapy if the participant 
became anxious during the sessions. The seated work was recorded using two cameras to ensure visibility of the interactions between 
the participant and therapist, canine, and caregiver; participant vocalizations and verbalizations; and participant facial expressions. We 
used two human-animal ethograms to code behavior during sessions and two behavioral assessments to note behavior occurring after 
sessions. All sessions occurred in the clinic located on the university's campus. Demographic data including participant age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, referral source, prior medical diagnoses, age of ASD or DD diagnosis, medications, and prior allied health, school, or 
psychological evaluations. The canine was trained as a therapy dog and was being trained as a service dog at the time of the study. The 
canine was present during sessions to interact with children and assist them to practice and develop skills to address identified deficits 
in social-emotional and adaptive functioning, prosocial behavior, and emotional regulation. AAT sessions were recorded to code 
interactions at a later time.
Objectives
1.Do interactions between a trained therapy canine and autistic children differ depending on the child's verbal abilities?
2.Is there a difference in prosocial behavior and emotional regulation in AAT sessions among children with varying verbal 
abilities?
3.Is there a difference in prosocial behavior and emotional regulation apart from animal-assisted therapy sessions among children 
with varying verbal abilities?
Design
We used standardized instruments to investigate human-animal intervention (HAI) occurring during AAT sessions and prosocial 
behavior and emotional regulation demonstrated by participants outside of AAT sessions. SPSS and Microsoft Excel were used to run 
the analysis. Descriptive statistics were utilized to compare prosocial behavior and emotional regulation occurring apart from AAT 
sessions between the two groups based on the self-report questionnaires completed by caregivers. Independent t-tests were used to 
analyze the differences in human-animal interaction among children with ASD with varying verbal abilities from the recorded sessions. 
The homogeneity of the variance (HOV) assumption between two groups was checked using Levene’s test for equality of variances in 
SPSS program before conducting the t-tests analysis. Results of t-tests with adjusted degrees of freedom value were reported if the 
HOV was violated. The null hypothesis was set to reflect no significant difference in HAI between verbal and nonverbal groups for the 
independent t-tests; therefore, a significant difference in the human-animal interaction behaviors regarding the children’s verbal 
abilities could be confirmed if the t-test results reject the null hypothesis. Cohen’s d was used to report the effect sizes of the 
independent t-tests; values up to 0.20 were interpreted as small, 0.50 as medium, and 0.80 as large effect sizes.  
Methods
Demographic data; past, family, and social histories; and prior therapy evaluations were collected during the initial consultation for 
enrollment into the ASD program. 
The Observation for Human Canine Interaction for Research (OHAIRE) Coding System from University of Arizona was used to 
note human bonding and prosocial behavior occurring during AAT sessions. The OHAIRE Coding System was specifically created 
for use in research with participants aged 4 to 16 years but may also be suitable for individuals of other ages, provided appropriate 
validity and reliability analyses are conducted. Participants must be with at least one other person during sessions to allow for the 
coding of social behaviors. The participant being observed is known as the primary participant. The coding system allows for the 
primary participant to engage in social behaviors with various targets, including caregivers, therapists, objects, and canines. While 
the OHAIRE was designed to code behavior in the presence of common domesticated canine species, it has been tested with a 
restricted range of canine species to date. The tool has previously been used to code interactions with dogs and guinea pigs, as well as 
social behaviors before and after interactions with horses (not direct interactions with horses). The coded behaviors are general 
enough to be assumed to apply to other domesticated canine species. Participants were video recorded continuously during 
unstructured interaction opportunities. Available activities provided opportunities to engage in both social and isolated behaviors. 
The video sample included a wide enough angle to observe the environment and all potential social interaction partners. The 
OHAIRE-V3 calculates a human-canine bond score in order to quantify the interactions taking place between the primary 
participant and the canine. The human-canine bond score was calculated for each 10-second interval based on the presence of an 
interaction between the primary participant and the canine, and the type of behaviors shown during that interaction. Participants 
received one point for each of the six behaviors from the ‘social communication & interaction’ category in the OHAIRE tool. No 
points were given if the primary participant does not interact with the canine. The behaviors included in the definition of the human 
canine bond score are talk, gesture, look, touch, affection, and prosocial behavior directed toward the canine. There are a total of six 
10-second intervals within each 1-minute video segment, and each of those 10-second intervals has six possible points: one point for 
each type of interaction. The total score from each 10-second interval is summed for a total overall human-canine bond score across 
the entire 1-minute video segment. Each 10-second interval will have a score between 0 and 6 points. Each 1-minute video segment 
will have a score between 0 and 36 points.
The 3-AAT Observation ethogram, adapted with permission from Johns Hopkins University,  was used to code both canine and 
human interaction during AAT sessions. The revised ethogram appraises the frequency of six domains of human interaction 
(affection, play, care, communication, comfort, withdrawal) and 24 subdomains of human behavior that can occur in an AAT 
session as seen in Table 1. The ethogram assesses the frequency, intensity, and duration of the interactions between the canine and 
child. Frequency is measured by a tally count and duration is assessed by rounding either up or down to the nearest 30 second mark. 
Each interaction has a code for intensity from 0 (not intense) to 3 (the most intense), and the mode of the interaction was entered to 
run the analysis.
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a 25-item tool developed to assess five domains: Emotional Problems, 
Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity, Peer Problems, and Prosocial. The SDQ is the most used instrument in measuring therapeutic 
effect of interventions within the emotional state in children and adolescents ages 2 to 18 years, demonstrating reliable internal 
consistency and validity. The SDQ has two versions, one to be administered at the initiation of therapy and then a follow-up version 
that includes two additional questions examining the impact of the therapeutic intervention. Scores from four behavioral domains 
range from zero (“normal”) to 10 (“very high concerns”), while Prosocial domain scores are reversed so that 10 indicates “normal” 
behavior and zero signifies “very high concerns”. The SDQ also assesses the total, impact, internalizing, and externalizing scores to 
provide a complete overview of the child’s behavior during the past four weeks. Total scores are the sum of the behavior domains 
except the Prosocial domains and range from zero (normal) to 40 (very high). Impact scores range from zero (normal) to 10 (very 
high) and reflect overall distress and impairment interfering with daily social interactions. Internalizing scores reflect the Emotional 
Problems and Peer Problems domains, while Externalizing scores are the sum of the Conduct Problems and Hyperactivity domains. 
Both the Internalizing and Externalizing domain scores range from zero (normal) to 20 (very high). The initial SDQ was 
administered at the beginning of the study and the follow-up assessment was used subsequently every four weeks until the study 
concluded. 
Lastly, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was administered weekly to measure therapeutic effects occurring in 
everyday life outside of the AAT session. The PANAS is a 20-item questionnaire utilizing a 5-point Likert scale to assess positive and 
negative affect occurring the week prior to administration. Each domain has 10 items with scores ranging from 10 to 50, with lower 
scores reflecting lower levels of positive or negative affect and higher scores signifying higher positive or negative affect29. Total 
scores on each scale are obtained by adding the scores for each item. Analysis of the PANAS demonstrates very good internal 
consistency reliability, with alphas ranging from 0.86 to 0.90 for Positive affect and from 0.84 to 0.87 for Negative affect.
Statistical Analysis Plan
This present study used standardized instruments to investigate human-animal intervention (HAI) occurring during AAT sessions 
and prosocial behavior and emotional regulation demonstrated by participants outside of AAT sessions. SPSS and Microsoft Excel 
were used to run the analysis. Descriptive statistics were utilized to compare prosocial behavior and emotional regulation occurring 
apart from AAT sessions between the two groups based on the self-report questionnaires completed by caregivers. A total of 144 
sessions were conducted, 84 of which were recorded and coded to analyze HAI during sessions. Independent t-tests were used to 
analyze the differences in human-animal interaction among children with ASD with varying verbal abilities from the recorded 
sessions. The homogeneity of the variance (HOV) assumption between two groups was checked using Levene’s test for equality of 
variances in SPSS program before conducting the t-tests analysis. Results of t-tests with adjusted degrees of freedom value were 
reported if the HOV was violated. The null hypothesis was set to reflect no significant difference in HAI between verbal and 
nonverbal groups for the independent t-tests; therefore, a significant difference in the human-animal interaction behaviors regarding 
the children’s verbal abilities could be confirmed if the t-test results reject the null hypothesis. Cohen’s d was used to report the 
effect sizes of the independent t-tests; values up to 0.20 were interpreted as small, 0.50 as medium, and 0.80 as large effect size.

PURPOSE OF STUDY   
This purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of services for children with developmental 
delay or autism spectrum disorder while using a dog trained in therapeutic techniques. This 
study’s aim is to see if therapy sessions with the dog result in an improvement in your child’s 
social and emotional abilities. Before you decide to allow your child to participate in this study, 
it is important that you understand why the study is being done and what will be involved. Please 
read the following information carefully. Please ask the co-investigator if there is anything that 
is not clear or if you need more information.  
DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
Activities involved in this study include weekly therapy sessions lasting 30 minutes that will 
assist your child with their identified social and emotional concerns. Your child will receive 24 
weeks of therapy, where 12 weeks will be with the dog and 12 weeks will be without the dog. 
You will be asked to complete a set of assessments on your child’s development, social -
emotional skills, functioning, parent-child interactions, and intelligence quotient throughout the 
study. If able, your child will indicate their level of anxiety before and after each therapy session 
using a picture of a thermometer with varying levels of anxiety. Adolescents may be asked to 
self-report how they feel their socialization and emotional behaviors were during the previous 
week.  
Animal-assisted therapy sessions include techniques aimed to help your child with identified 
concerns in social and emotional behavior. The dog is trained to assist your child to engage in 
social interaction, like playing gently and taking turns during a game. Animal-assisted activities 
include playing fetch and other turn-taking games, assisting the dog to complete puzzles, 
coloring pictures with the dog, petting the dog, and grooming the dog. The dog can also give 
“hugs” if your child is anxious by leaning his body gently against your child’s legs. Free play 
with the dog will be allowed once your child and dog have built a relationship. The sessions with 
the dog will last between 10 and 15 minutes, then the remaining time will be spent discussing 
home therapy techniques to practice until the next session. Research personnel who have been 
training the dog may be present to assist the dog during the session, and Dr. Kilmer, the dog’s 
owner and handler, will be present while the dog is in the therapy session with your child. 
Traditional therapy sessions without the dog will last for 30 minutes and will focus on home 
therapeutic techniques to identify and improve social and emotional concerns. All therapy 
sessions in the clinic will be video -recorded for resear ch purposes.  
 
RISKS   
Minimal risks are associated with these studies. Other than the normal emotional risks associated 
with therapy of this type, the only risk involved with this research is normal minimal risk 
involved with interacting with a well -behaved  dog The dog is being trained as a therapy and 
service dog and attends weekly sessions with experienced trainers. Dr. Kilmer is being educated 
to properly perform animal -assisted therapy sessions. The dog will be on leash throughout the 
session and researc h personnel will be present to remove the dog if he or your child appear to be 
distressed. The research personnel have been involved in the dog’s training and will be 
constantly assessing his behavior and can remove him as needed. There is a very small ris k of 
injury from the dog (e.g., scratching, teething/nipping); however, given the extensive training of 
the dog and continuous monitoring of the dog at all times, this risk is considered minimal and 
unlikely.  
  
BENEFITS   
There are no direct benefits to yo u for allowing your child's assessments to be used in this 
research; however, results from this research could improve therapeutic care of children with 
developmental delay or autism spectrum disorder. Your child will also receive a plush toy that 
looks li ke the dog for participating in the study.  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY   
Participant data will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law and University 
policy.  Your responses to the  questionnaires and evaluations  will have all identifying 
information removed. The co -investigators will keep data in their computers that are password 
protected. Notes, interview transcriptions, and any other hard -copies of identifying participant 
information  will be secured  in a locked file cabinet in the personal possession of the  co-
investigators. Videos of therapeutic sessions will be downloaded to co -investigators’ password -
protected university -issued computers within 24 hours and then immediately deleted from the 
camcorder device. Only research personnel will have access to the se files, unless otherwise 
required by law. Co -investigators are legally obligated to report specific incidents which include, 
but may not be limited to, incidents of abuse and suicide risk.   
 
Your child has been identified at -risk for developmental delay or autism spectrum disorder by 
his/her primary care provider (PCP), who then referred your child to the EMSON Pediatric 
Health Lab for further developmental assessment. As such, the referring PCP will receive the 
results of the assessments as well as recom mendations for identified concerns. Also, the 
investigators may request your consent to obtain medical records from the referring provider, 
allied health, and specialty clinics who take care of your child. Your child’s school teacher and 
staff may be conta cted to provide records or complete forms necessary for the evaluations if 
indicated. Aside from this, the co -investigators request permission to use assessment results in 
research on pediatric autism and developmental delay.

Title: The Effect of Animal-Assisted Therapy on Prosocial Behavior in Children with
Developmental Delay or Autism Spectrum Disorder
•What is the purpose of this research? Please explain both why you are doing the research (class assignment,
thesis, etc.) AND/OR state your hypothesis. See attachment is not a sufficient response.
The proposed project will investigate the effects of utilizing animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in the therapy plan for
youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD). The purpose of this study is to explore
identified gaps in knowledge pertaining to AAT in pediatric ASD and DD care management. Specifically, we seek
to document canine care and behavior during training and AAT sessions, assess human and canine interaction
during AAT sessions, and analyze long-term effects of AAT on social-emotional and adaptive functioning in the
pediatric participants once the sessions have ended. This study will address the following research questions: 1.
What measures should be taken to ensure protection of the canine before, during, and after AAT sessions as well
as during training? 2. What human-animal interaction behaviors are present during AAT sessions with pediatric
participants ages 12 months to 18 years? 3. What effect does AAT have on pediatric development and social-
emotional and adaptive functioning? 4. Are effects in development and social-emotional and adaptive functioning
produced by AAT sustainable after completion of the 12-week AAT program?
•Are you collecting data about living individuals?
Yes
•Are you collecting data through intervention or interaction with these individuals?
Yes
•Beyond the basic Participant Types (children, UofA Students, adults, etc.) named elsewhere in this
application, do you have a target population (particular group of people) you want to recruit? Some
examples might be students in a particular class, members of a particular group or network, people
in a specific age range (whether adult or minor), children in a particular school or class, etc.
Yes
•Describe your target population.
Dr. Kilmer collaborates with the Community Clinic of NWA who refer children, ages 18 months
to 18 years, at risk for developmental delay or autism spectrum disorders to her clinic, Access for
Autism (A4A), for further developmental evaluation and care management. Children receiving care
management by the A4A program who have developmental or behavioral concerns can volunteer to
enter this study.
•How are you recruiting participants? Are you standing in a public place asking people to take
a survey, sending out introductory emails, posting an ad or blurb on a website or social media,
posting a flyer in a public location, etc.? **Please note that all recruitment materials will need to be
uploaded in the Notes and Attachments section.
Dr. Kilmer will discuss the study with parents/guardians whose children have been referred to the A4A
clinic for further developmental evaluation. Participation in the study is voluntary and does not affect other
services provided by the A4A clinic.
•Provide a brief description of the procedures involving the participants.
All interactions between the canine and participants will occur either at the A4A clinic, in the EPLEY
Center for Healthcare Professionals, or at the Psychology lab on campus. The first interaction between
the canine and the participant will focus on introducing the two and facilitating a bond through play,
such as petting or brushing the canine, or throwing a ball. The Purdue University Veterinary College of
Medicine O'HAIRE Coding System will be used to observe and code human behavior during this session.
Drs. Kilmer and Quetsch use a variety of behavioral and developmental evaluations to identify concerns
and provide strategies for home therapy to improve delays: 1. Participants ages 8 years and older who are
cognitively capable will be asked to self-report their emotional state before and after each AAT session
using an 11-point Likert scale chart in the shape of a thermometer, with ranges from "no distress/totally
relaxed" to "highest anxiety/stress that you've ever felt." 2. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
3. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule 4. Ages and Stages Questionnaire- 3rd edition 5. Ages and
Stages Questionnaire: Social and Emotional - 2nd edition 6. Social-Emotional Assessment Measure 7.
Vineland- 3rd edition 8. Social Responsiveness Scale- 2nd edition 9. PEDS: DM-AL 10. Standford-Binet
Intelligence Quota Test Caregiver satisfaction and perspectives of AAT integration in therapy sessions
will be assessed via surveys. Demographic data including participant age, gender, race/ethnicity, referral
source, prior medical diagnoses, age of ASD or DD diagnosis, medications, and prior allied health or
psychological therapies will be collected on all participants. Dr. Kilmer will incorporate AAT into the
therapy sessions at the A4A clinic that are guided by the Ages and Stages developmental and social/
emotional assessments to target gross and fine motor skill, language, social, and emotional development.
Parents will be given handouts that are designed to address deficits identified by the ASQ-3, ASQ:SE-2,
and SEAM assessments. The canine will be present to interact with children as they are learning their skill
for that week. For example, the canine will interact with the participant while the participant is learning a
new skill, such as improvement in handwriting, and the participant will be able to interact and play with
the canine if the participant focuses on completing the therapy assignment. Likewise, participants will
earn points if they perform their therapy strategies at home and can use those points to interact and play
with the canine at their next therapy session. Plush dog toys who look like the canine will be given to
pediatric participants as incentive to perform their home therapies. The following data will be collected
on the canine: 1. The Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), a validated
measure to quantify animal behavior during training developed by the University of Pennsylvania in
2003. The C-BARQ database will be used to compare the canine's training progress with other Black
Labrador Retriever dogs and can also alert to the onset of behavioral problems so Dr. Kilmer can target
these concerns early in the training process. 2. The canine behavior ethogram which assesses 26 canine
behaviors during human-animal interactions. The ethogram is divided into three categories: affiliative
indicators, moderate stress indicators, and high-stress indicators. The research team will track the number
of AAT sessions in which the canine participates each day to assess for variations in temperament and
performance. 3. The exact minutes in which canine behaviors are present will be recorded in each AAT
session, noting patterns that indicate fatigue or distress. Human-animal interaction will be assessed by: 1.
The Purdue University Veterinary College of Medicine O'HAIRE Coding System will be used to observe
and code human behavior during AAT sessions. Observable behaviors categories captured by the OHAIRE
Coding System include Interactive Behaviors (Social Communication & Environmental Interaction),
Emotional Display (Facial, Verbal), and Interfering Behaviors (Aggression, Overactivity, Isolation). The
OHAIRE-V3 assessment will be used to calculate a human-animal bond score to quantify the interactions
taking place between the pediatric participants and the animal. The ELAN Coding software will be used
to achieve high inter-rater reliability through precise timing of observed interactions. All AAT sessions
will be recorded after receiving consent from families to retroactively code participant behavior during
sessions.
•How long are the procedures likely to take? Include duration and frequency.
The A4A weekly therapy sessions will last about 30 minutes; however only it is expected that the total
HAI time will be approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on the therapy activity. Honors students will
assist the canine with Dr. Kilmer during the sessions and will take the canine to Dr. Kilmer's office once
the HAI part of the appointment has ended.
•How will information be given to people to get their informed consent to participate in this research?
Answers should include specific methods (e.g., verbal consent, information handout, online consent
form, full consent form requiring signature documentation.) **Please note that consent materials --
from a script for verbal consent to full consent forms that require participant signature -- must be
uploaded in the Notes and Attachments section.
Dr. Kilmer will contact parents/guardians of potential participants to explain the AAT program and gage
their interest. If interested, parents will come to the A4A clinic on the first floor of ECHP to meet the
canine and sign the informed consent form. Verbal assent will be obtained from pediatric patients who are
cognitively able to give it.
•Does data collection rely on a scheduled event, such as a convention or specific date?
No
•How will your data be collected? Include all that apply: online, on paper/in person, audio and/
or video recordings. **Please note that all data collection materials will need to be uploaded in
the Notes and Attachments section. This includes: surveys, questionnaires, interview questions or
anything that is given to or asked of a participant.
Data will be collected in the initial consultation form for the A4A clinic, through performing
developmental assessments, and with surveys. All AAT sessions will be recorded after receiving consent
from families to retroactively code participant behavior during sessions. The following will be used to
collect data: 1. A4A Intake form: all participants 2. Ages and Stages Questionnaire- 3rd edition: 1 month
to 5.5 years 3. Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social/Emotional- 2nd edition: birth to age 6 years 4. Social
and Emotional Assessment/ Measure: 2 to 66 months 5. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: 3 to 16
years 6. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule: 9 to 14 years 7. Vineland- 3rd edition: 3 to 21 years 8.
Social Responsiveness Scale- 2nd edition: 2.5 to 18 years 9. PEDS: DM-AL: 7 to 11 years 10. Standford-
Binet IQ Test: 2 to 18 years
•How will your data be stored? Include all that apply: electronically, on paper, audio and/or video
recordings.
Survey data will be stored in REDCap, a HIPAA-secured software which caregivers of youth with
complete on a personal device (iPad, laptop, cellphone). Data will only be accessible by approved
research staff. Data obtained in the ASQ- 3, ASQ: SE-2, SEAM, Vineland- 3, Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scores will be stored in Dr. Kilmer's
password protected laptop. Any hard-copy measures of documents will be stored in Drs. Kilmer or
Quetsch's locked lab space in a locked filing cabinet. Video files will be downloaded from camcorders
directly to Dr. Quetsch's locked lab space located in Memorial Hall on the password-protected computers
and then additionally secured as a password protected file. Only authorized research personnel will have
access to these files.
•How will that data be kept secure?
Data will be stored on Drs. Kilmer and Quetsch's password-protected computers. Any hard-copy measures
of documents will be stored in Dr. Quetsch's locked lab space in a locked filing cabinet. Only participant
numbered IDs will be included on assessment documents. Participant identifying information and
associated ID numbers will be stored in the Quetsch lab in a password protected computer on a password
protected document. Only Drs. Quetsch and Kilmer will have access to participant ID information while
the remaining research staff will utilize participant ID numbers. All video files will be downloaded to Dr.
Quetsch's lab computers within 24 hours and then immediately deleted from the camcorder device. Video
files will be stored on a password-protected computer as password-protected documents.
•Minimal Risk is defined as risks of harm not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily
life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. Will
participants be exposed to more than minimal risk? Include in your consideration the potential
of mental risks if asking sensitive questions, or legal or reputational risks in case of breach of
confidentiality.
Yes
•Describe the risks in question and any precautions that will be taken to minimize those risks.
Participants will not be exposed to more than minimal risks while receiving developmental or
behavioral evaluations. Participants will be exposed to the canine during therapy sessions for
approximately 10 to 15 minutes weekly. The canine will be removed if signs of fatigue, fright, or
irritation appear. He will remain on leash throughout the entire AAT session and will be wearing a
harness. Honors students will have the canine's leash during the AAT session and will hold him by
the harness handle. Also, Dr. Kilmer will assess the disposition of the pediatric participants before
allowing the canine to come to the room and will not allow the canine to participant if the pediatric
participant's behavior is disruptive or potentially dangerous for the canine.
•Are there any direct benefits to the participants for participating in this study?
Yes
•Describe the benefits participants will or may receive.
Pediatric participants will receive one plush toy that looks like the canine they are working with.

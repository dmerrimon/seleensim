Amendment 5 ( 23-May -2017)
Amendment rationale
As of 04-May-2017, enrollment is ongoing with 35 patients randomized, and 4 patients currently  
receiving stud y treatment. The purpose of this protocol amendment is to:
-To add duration of response among the secondary  study objectives to better characterize 
the clinical benefit in patients responding to treatment. This information may contribute to 
define the benefit/risk profile in this patient population. 
-To provide clarification in the description of the secondary  objective on the assessment of 
genot ype/phenot ype relationships of VEGF or other members of the VEGF signaling 
pathway .
-To add the option of closing recruitment of further patients in a given study  cohort if no 
objective responses are observed in patients treated in two out of the three cohorts of 
primary  interest during stage 1 of the study . 
-To update the allowed timeframe for prior use of monoclonal antibodies under eligibility  
criteria. 
-To update the contraception/pregnancy language to align with the most recent Investigator 
Brochure version 15 (IBv.15) referring to specific requirements in male and female patients 
while receiving study treatment as well as during follow up period. 
-To remove the exclusion criterion on concomitant treatment with anti-inflammatory  and 
anti-platelet agents. Based on clinical data in adult patients a drug -to-drug interaction when 
pazopanib is co- administered with anti -inflammatory  agents is not expected.
-To modify  the criteria for starting subsequent treatment cycles. This modification will 
clarify  the criteria for starting subsequent cycles when no radiological tumor assessments 
are performed and align the conditions to resume/interrupt study  treatment with toxicity  
management guidelines.
-The sentence on “medications that increase gastric pH” is now updated to Proton Pump 
Inhibitors (PPI). This change is reflected in the protocol section on “Prohibited 
medications.”
-To add anti-inflammatory  and anti-platelet agents in the protocol section “Permitted 
medication to be used with caution”. The use of these agents as a concomitant treatment 
should be monitored since pazopanib may result in an increase of blood pressure and 
bleeding episodes.
-To clarify  that re-initiation of study  treatment following hepatotoxicity  requires approval 
from the Study  Chair.
-To clarify  that PK sampling is not required beyond Cycle 11 since it is unlikely  that data 
beyond cy cle 11 will provide any modification in the clinical pharmacology assessment of 
the study  drug.
-To define the Per Protocol population and specify which anal ysis will be c onducted in the 
different protocol defined datasets (Per Protocol Population and mI TT population).

ABSTRACT
Anti-angiogenic therapy viavascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockad ehasbeen shown in several 
studies to be an effective cancer therapy .VEGF is apotent mediator ofendothelial proliferation, survival,
and vascular permeabili ty1and is present inmostmalignancies; higher VEGF expression has been
correlated withadvanced stage or poor pr ognosis disease .2-8Platelet derive dgrowth factor (PDGF) 
signalin gviaPDGF Ralsoplays a k eyrole in angiogenesi s by recruitin gvascula rmura lcells,which 
stabili ze vessel s when VEG F level s decline.9 There are anumbe r of preclinical studies identifying VEGFR,
PDGFR10-20and stem cell facto r receptor (KIT) in a widerange ofpediatric tumors .17,21
Pazopanib (GW78603 4)isasmal l-molecu le tyrosine kinase inhibitor thathasbeen shown toprevent ligand
induced receptor autophosphorylation of VEGF R-1,-2,-3, PDGF R-α,-βandc-Kit. In addition, a number
ofinvivo murine xenograft studies demonst rategrowt hinhibition oftumor s bypazopanib. This study will
examine theefficacy ofpazopanib inchildren with avariety ofrelapsed solid tumors. The study will
alsoseek tofurther define thetoxicities of pazopanib inchildren, as well asexamin ebiologic markers that 
may help to further define the response characteristics of pazopanib.

invitrostudies. It alsohas modest activit yagainst FGFR1 , –R3 and c-fms but is ot herwise highly  
selective. Pazopanib ishighl yprotein bound ( > 99.9%) thus ininvivo studies, steady state 
concentrations exceedin g 18 μg/mL were required toprevent VEGFR2 signaling.24Pharmacokinetic 
studies in adults have shown that these concentrations are readily achievable.
2.2 Precl inical Studies
2.2.1 Antitumor Activity
Pazopanib treatment has been shown to inhibit thegrowth ofa variety of
established (100-250 µL) huma ntumor xenografts inmous emodels including renal
cellcarcinom a (Cak i-2),colon carcinom a (HT29), non-small-celllung carcinoma
(NCI-H322), melanoma (A375), prostate carcinom a(PC3), and breast carcinoma
(BT474). Pazopanib demonstrated a wide therapeutic index asithad noeffec t on
mous e body weight and all animals appeared activ e and healthy throughout
preclinical studies. Histological analysis following pazopanib administration
demonstrate dapoptosis ornecrosis oftumo rcells; TUNEL assays confirmed
increased apoptosis. This effect correlated with reduced angiogenesis asmeasured
by decreased concurrent endothelial (CD31) stainin g.Theanti-angiogenic activity 
ofpazopanib has also been demonstrated inmous e corneal micropocket and 
Matrigel plug analyses .24
There hasbeen limitedpediatric pre-clinical testin g ofpazopani b;however, growth
delay was observed inone subcutaneous modelofneuroblastoma and was
significantly enhanced by concomitant administration ofmetronomic topotecan.25
The pediatric preclinical testing progra m(PPTP) also tested the activity of
pazopanib against alimited panel ofpediatric sarcom axenografts and observed
delayed time to progression, butno tumor regression.26Other multi-targeted
tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been screened bythePPTP using amore complete
solid tumo rxenograft panel . Thepan-VEGFR inhibitor cediranib demonstrated
broad invivoantitumor activity (78%; primarily tumor growth delay) including:
3/3 rhabdoid, 2/3 Wilms' ,3/3 Ewing, 5/5 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1/3
medulloblastoma, 2/4glioblastoma, 5/6neuroblastoma, 4/5osteosarcoma, with one 
complete response each in a rhabdoid andosteosarcom axenograft. Similarly the
multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitini b(VEGF R-1,-2,-3, PDGF R-α,-β,c-Kit,

and FLT3receptors) showed intermediate (13/34) andhigh (1/34) levels of
activit yagainst 14of34evaluable solid tumo rxenografts, including 4 of 6 
rhabdomyosarcoma , 4 of 5 Ewin gtumor, and2 of 3 rhabdoid tumor. The 
overlapping spectrum ofreceptors targeted by these agentssuggests thebroad 
potential of pazopanib for pediatric anti -tumor activity.
2.2.2 Animal Toxicology
Inmonkeys, nospecific toxic effects were seen after 1mont hwith oraldoses of 
up to 500mg/kg/day , adose resultin g in a C max andAUC 0-t of 36 μg /mLand 
316 μg•h/m L respectively. However, a dose of 500 mg/kg/da ycould not be
tolerated formorethan 34weeks due to severe toxicity, consistin g of diarrhea, 
anorexia, moribundit yandaccumulation of crystalline material in a number of 
organs. Monke yswere given 5 or 50 mg/kg/da ypazopanib for1 year, without 
observed toxicity. The noobserved adve rseeffect level (NOAEL) after 1 year 
was50mg/kg/day .Mean plasma Cmax andAUC 0-t values at 50 mg/kg/da ywere 
31.8 μg/mL and235 μg•h/mL, respectively, inmale monkey sand44.0 μg/mL
and 289 μg•h/mL , respectively, in female monkey s after 1 year (Pazopanib 
GW786034 Investigator's Brochure).
There arenopublished datadescribing thetoxicity ofpazopanib injuvenile 
primates. However, doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day were not tolerated in juvenile rats with 
marke dreductions inbodyweight aswell asmortality seen. These effects occurred
atexposures that were simila r to or below those expecte d in pediatric cancer
patients. The specific nature of the effects in these animals is not currently know n
butispresume d to be related tovasculogenesis incritical organs such as the heart, 
liver, or kidney. In the two surviving groups, 0.3 and 3mg/kg/day there did not 
appear to be an effect on body weigh t although one anima l at 3 mg/kg/da yhad
bilateral broken incisors. Hypertroph y of epiphyseal growth plates, andtooth
abnormalities (includin gexcessively long, brittle, broken andmissing teeth, and
dentin eand enamel degeneration and thinning) werealso observed during
repea teddose administration inmature ratandmurine models butnotabl ynotin
adult monkey s (Pazopanib GW786034 Investigator's Brochure).
These findings are consistent with previous observations of physeal dysplasia and 
ovarian anduterine changes injuvenile animals, including cynomolgus monkeys, 
during thepreclinical testin g ofother potent VEG Fblocking agents raising concern 
ofpotential pediatric -specific adverse effects onlong-term growth and 
development.27,28Nonetheless, atleast inmurine models, thechanges inbone 
growth appeared reversible after cessation of therapy .27Consistent with the know n
roles of VEGF infollicle maturation and corpus luteu mformation there were
significant reductions infemale ratfertilit y at pazopanib doses > 30 mg/kg/day .
Inmales, reductions intesticular andepididymal weights were observed at≥30 
mg/kg/da yand spermproduction, motility and concentration were reduced at
100 mg/kg/day, butthisdid notresul t in a functional effec ton matin g or male
fertility. Consistent with thecritical role ofVEGF in embryogenesis, cardiac 
malformations were observed inratfetuses at maternal doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day.
Delayed ossification (≥ 3 mg/kg/day) , embryo lethality and reduced fetalbody
weight were observed at 10 mg/kg/day .The NOAE L for developmental toxicit y 
inthe ratwas 1 mg/kg/da y(Pazopanib GW786034 Investigator's Brochure).
2.2.3 Preclinica l Pharmacology
14C-pazopanib demonstrates wide tissue distribution. Themajority ofpazopanib 
measured in plasm ais unmodified, minor metabolites including mono-oxygenated

Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
and de-methylated forms . In ratsandmonkeys ,pazopanib is predominately 
excreted inthe feces with asmall amount eliminated inthe urine. Following
absorption inthemonkey ,pazopanib isprincipall ymetabolized inthe liver by
oxida tion and d i-demethylation with glucuronidation. In vitro studies indicate that
theoxidative metabolis m of pazopanib inhuma nliver microsomes isprimaril y
mediated byCYP3A4, with minor contributions fromCYP1A 2and CYP2C8.
There appears to be minima lpotential forinductive effects onCYP enzym e
activities inrats or monkey safter oraldoses (300 and 500 mg/k g, respectivel y) of
pazopani bfor1month. (Pazopanib GW786034 Investigator's Brochure)
In order to optimiz e in vivodosing for pazopani band determ ine whether Csteady
state or Cmax best correlated with activity, once andtwice daily p.o. dosing was
compared with a continuous infusion of a pazopanib analogue (GW771806). Both
HT29 tumor growt hinhibition and ant i-angiogenic activity inthe Matrigel plug
assay correlated with steady state concentrations of pazopanib and not with Cmax
orexposure (AUC). Complet etumor growth inhibition wasachieved with a steady-
state plasm a concentration of 2.67 μMol/ L pazopanib. This value corresponded
with apazopanib steady- stateconcentration of18 μg/mL .Atthis level, pazopanib
also demonstrate dinhibition of VEGF -induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in vivo,
butiftheconcentration dropped belowthislevel, inhibition was minimal, again 
indicating the need to sustain effective levels .24
2.3 Adult Studies
Asof 09 September 2012, approximately 5000 patien tshave received pazopanib asmonotherapy 
or in combination outof approximately 7000 patien tsenrolled inpazopani boncolog yclinical 
studies. Data collected to date showthatpazopanib administration at800 mg daily isassociated 
with a reasonable safety profile and encourag ing efficacy in various oncology settings. Pazopanib 
isapproved forthetreatment ofadult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC )andfor
thetreatment ofadult patients with soft tissue sarcom awho have received prior chemotherapy. 
Results ofpharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrat ethat (a)pazopanib is 
absorbed after oraladministration; (b)aplateau is reached in steady- statesystemic exposure ata 
dose of 800 mg daily; (c)amaximu mtolerated dose hasnotbeen reached atpazopanib doses up 
to 2000 mg daily; and(d)doses ofpazopanib that maintain plasm apazopanib concentrations 
above 15 μg/m L (i.e., 800 mg daily and 300 mg twice daily [BID] ) are associated with 
pharmacodynamic andclinical effects. Pazopanib administered asoraldoses up to 800 mg daily  
is being developed by Novartis for the treatment of a variety of cancer s.
2.3.1 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data in Adults with Cancer
Theoralbioavailability ofpazopani breflects absorption thatislimited by solubility
above doses of800 mg once daily; therefore, increases indoses above 800mg, up
tothehighest dose evaluated (2000 mg), inthefasted state willnot result in
increased systemic exposure. Geometric mean pazopanib t½ values ranged from
18.1 to 52.3 hours. The geometric mean t½ was 30.9 hours inthe800 m g once
daily dose group, themonotherap ydose selected foradministration inPhase II and
Phase IIIclinical trials. The tmax was 3 to 4 hours. The oral bioavailability of
pazopani bmay also be affected byitssubstrat eaffinit yforgut efflux transporters.
Oral absorption issignificantly enhanced when pazopanib is dosed with food; 
therefore, it is recommended toadminister pazopanib onan empty stomach, at least 
1 hour before or 2 hours after ameal.
The absolute bioavailability ofpazopan ib(median 21%) suggest s that the majority 
Novartis Confidential Page 23
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
(67%) of the oral dose recovered unchanged in feces represents unabsorbed drug.
Pazopanib isnotextensively metabolized andfirst-pass metabolis m is minor,
consi stent withitslowplasm aclearance andsmallvolume of distribution.
Age, race, and gender had no effect onpazopani b PK. Mild/moderate renal 
impairment isnotexpected toinfluence pazopanib exposure, and dose adjustment 
isnot necessary. Based onbasel inehepatic function, 400 mg pazopanib is
recommended forpatients with mild impairment (defined aseither normal bilirubin
andanydegree ofalanine aminotransferase [ALT ]elevation or asanelevation of
bilirubin upto1.5x uppe r limit ofnorma l[ULN] regardless of theALTvalue),
and 200 mg forpatients with moderat eimpairment (defined as anelevation of
bilirubin >1.5 to3xUL N regardless oftheALTvalues) . The maximu m dose of
pazopanib (200 mg) administered topatients with severe hepatic impairment did 
not achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therefore, pazopanib isnot 
recommended inpatients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin 
>3xULN regardless of any level of ALT).
In clinical studies with pazopanib , events of QT prolongation or torsade de pointes 
have occurred. Pazopani bshould beused with caution inpatients witha history of
QT i nterval prolongation, patients takin gantiarrythmics or other medications that
maypotentially prolong QT i nterval, orthose withrelevant pre-existing cardiac 
disease. When using pazopanib, baseline and periodic monitoring ofECGs and
maintenance of electrol ytes(calcium, magnesium, potassium) within normal range 
is recommended.
Pharmacodynamic data indicat ethatpazopanib, atamonother apydose of800 
mgonce daily, results in effects consistent with inhibition of the VEGF receptors 
itwas designed to targe t (i.e., increases inVEGF and decreases insoluble 
VEGFR2). Concentration -effect relationships were observed between trough 
plasma pazopanib concentrations andan increase inblood pressure intheFirst 
Time in Huma nstudy, aswell as in the percent chang e frombaseline insoluble 
VEGFR2 nadir inthePhase II study inrenal cell carcinoma .The trough plasma 
pazopanib concentrations associated with one-halfthemaximal effect (EC50) in 
both concentration effectrelationships were similar (12 to 15.3μg/m L for 
hypertension and 21.3μg/m Lforsoluble VEGFR2), which demonstrates that there
isaconsistent inhibition of VEGF receptor(s) inpatien tswith cancer when plasma 
pazopanib concentrations are maintained abov e 15-20 μg/mL.
2.3.2 Safety Data in Adults with Cancer (adverse events and serious a dverse events)
In a r andomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase III study ofpazopanib 
monotherapy inpatien tswith advanced RCC , themedian time ontreatment was 
approximately twice that on placebo (7.4 months versus 3.8 months) .29 The overall
frequency ofadverse events (AEs) reported during thestudywashigher inthe
pazopanib arm(92%) compared with placeb o(74%). Most commo nAEs reported
in>20% patien ts in thepazopanib arm(asof 23 May2008) were diarrhea
(52%), hypertension (40%), hair color chang e(depigmentation; 38%), nausea 
(26%), anorexia (22%), and vomiting (21%). These AEs were all reported at a 
higher incidence in the pazopanib arm than in the placebo arm. Most of these events
were Grade 1 or 2 using theNational Cance r Institute Commo nToxicity Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0. More Grade 3AEswere reported
in the pazopani b arm (33% ) compared with the placebo arm (14%) . The frequency
Novartis Confidential Page 24
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
ofGrade 4 AE andGrad e 5events wassimilar between the pazopanib andplacebo
arms: Grad e 4 in 7% and6%,respectively ;Grade 5 in 4% and3%,respectively.29
Atthe timeof the final overall survival (OS) analysis, a subsequent review of
safetydata did not reveal anychanges tothepreviously observed safety profile ; no 
new safety signals were detected.
Based on theanalysis of the safety data integrated across 3RCC studie s, including 
aPhase II study ofpazopani bmonotherap y in patients with advanced RC Canda
single armPhase IIIextension studyofpazopanib monotherap yin patien tswith
advanced RCCasof January 9, 2009 (N=593), themost common AEs andserious 
adverse events (SAEs) were simila r tothoseobserved inthe pazopanib armofthe 
monotherapy Phase IIIstudy.
Ina randomized placebo -controlled Phase IIIstudy of pazopanib monotherapy in 
patien tswith soft tissue sarcom a[STS]) ,themedian time on pazopanib was19.4 
weeks, ascompared with 8.1weeks intheplacebo arm.Themostcommon AEs 
(≥20%) reported in the pazopanib arm (as of May 23, 2011) were fatigue (65%), 
diarrhea (59%), nause a(56%) ,weight decreased (51%), hypertension (42%), 
decreased appetite (40%), haircolor changes (39%), vomiting (33%), tumor pain 
(30%), dysguesia (28%), headache (23%), musculoskeletal pain (23%), myalgia 
(23%), gastrointestinal pain(23%), anddyspne a(20%). Twenty- eight percent of 
patien ts on placebo and63%of patien ts on pazopanib experienced an AE of 
maximu mGrade 3 or higher. Theproportion of patien tswho experienced 
maximum Grade 4 and Grade 5 AEs was similar in both treatment arms. 30
Ananalysis of integrated safetydata from aPhase IIIstudy inpatientswith STS 
andasingle arm Phase II study ofpazopanib monotherap y in patien tswith STS 
showed asafety profile similar tothat observe d in thepazopani barm of the 
Phase IIIstudy alone. Increased rates of myocardial dysfunction, venous thrombo -
embolic events, andpneumothorax were newl y observed intheSTS studies as
compared toRCC .Rare but severe AEspreviously described for VEGFR inhibitors, 
such as cardiac/cerebral ischemia , hemorrhage, and bowel perforation, were 
observed with pazopanib treatme nt.
Areview ofSAEs acros soncolog ystudies revealed that themost frequently 
reported SAEs (≥ 70 events), regardless of causality and treatment regimen, as of 
September 9, 2011 in decreasin g order of frequency were increased ALT, dyspnea, 
vomiting, abdo minalpain, pyrexia, diarrhea, anemia , pneumonia, dehydration, and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased.
2.3.3 Efficacy Data in Adults with Cancer
Pazopanib 800 mg once daily hasshown efficacy and/or encouragin gefficacy 
signals in the following settings:
RCC : The primar y analysis of the primar y endpoint, progression -free survival 
(PFS), revealed alarge andhighly statistically significant improvement inPFS
inthepazopanib -treated patien ts compared toplacebo -treated patien ts (hazard 
ratio [HR] 0.46, 95% c onfidence interval [CI] 0.34 to 0.62, p<0.0000001). The 
median PFS inthepazopanib armwas more than double that in theplaceb o
arm: 9.2months (95% CI, 7.4, 12.9) versus 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.8, 4.2),
respectively. The respons erate(RR), define das the percentage of patien ts who 
achieved either a confirmed complete response (CR) orpartial response (PR)

according toResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) was 
significantly higher for the pazopanib arm compared with the placebo arm by 
Independent Review Committee (IRC )assessment (30% vs.3%,p<0.001). In
thepazopanib arm, themedian duration ofresponse was58.7 week s(95%
CI, 52.1 to 68.1 weeks) and the median time to response was 11.9 weeks (95% 
CI, 9.4 to 12.3 weeks) byIRCassessmen t.29 The median OS at final analysis
was 22.9 months inthepazopani barmand20.5 month s in theplacebo arm.The
final OSwas not statistically different between thepazopanib arm and the
placebo arm in (HR =0.91, stratified log-rank p-value, 0.224). Ofnote, 54% of 
patien ts in theplacebo armreceived pazopanib, many starting early inthe study, 
and an additional 12% received other systemic therapies.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma : In a Phase III study a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS but not OS was observed in the pazopanib arm compared
with theplacebo arm. Median progressio n-freesurvival was 4.6 months for
pazopanib compared with 1.6months for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.31, 95%
CI 0.24-0.40; p<0.0001) .Overall survival was 12.5months with pazopanib 
versus 10.7 months with placebo (HR 0.86, 0.67- 1.11; p=0.25).30In a Phase II 
Study, the PFS rate at 12 weeks, based on investigator assessment, was 18 of
41patien ts(43.9%) forleiomyosarcoma; 18 of 37 patien ts (48.6%) for synovial 
sarcoma ; 5 of 19 (26.3%) for adipocytic sarcoma; and 16of 41 patien ts(39.0%)
forother types of sarcom a.31
Ovarian cancer: 11 of 36 patien ts(31%) experience d acancer antigen -125 
(CA-125) response to pazopanib, with amedian time to CA-125 response of
29days andmedia nduration of response of 113days.Excluding one patient 
whose CA-125 decreased before shereceived thefirst dose, thebiochemical
response was 28%(10patien ts).Overall response rate based onmodified
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG )criteria (incorporating CA-125, 
RECIST, and clinical assessment) was 18% in patien ts with measur able disease 
at baseline, and was 21% inpatien tswithout measurable disease at baseline. 
Median PFS was 84 days .32
Early -stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) :30 of 35 patien ts 
(86%) experience da reduction intumo rvolum eafter short-term use of 
pazopanib (media nduration of 16 days) asassessed by high-resolution 
computed tomography (HRCT) after preoperative pazopanib treatment .33
ErbB 2-positive advanced ormetastatic breast cancer: Ahigher response 
rate(36.2% versus 22.2%) byindependent revie w at Week 12wasobserved in
patien ts on combination lapatinib 1000 mg once daily + pazopanib 400mgonce
daily compared with lapatinib 1500 mg once daily asamonotherapy, 
respectivel y.34
Cervical cancer: There was a 34% reduction inriskforprogression for 
patien ts receiving pazopanib relative to lapatin ib (hazard ratio: 0.66; 90% CI: 
0.48, 0.91). The median time to investigato r-assessed PFS was 17.1 weeks in 
the lapatinib group and 18.1 weeks in the pazopanib (one -sided p=0.013).35
Pazopanib hasnotshow n signals ofefficacy inPhase II studies conducted in 
multiple myeloma (VEG20006)36orglioma (VEG102857).
Most important to the rational e for this curren t trial are the result s from the study 
ofpazopanib in adult patients with advanced ormetastatic soft tissue sarcoma. 
These combine d findings formthebasis for includin gseveral cohorts forsoft tissue 
andbonesarcom aaswell as the embryonal tumor sspecific topediatrics, which are 
of mesenchymal origin.

Todate, results ofcorrelativ ebiologic assays specific topazopanib are limited. 
Most studies sample platele t-poor plasm a andserum forcytokine/angiogenic factor 
profilin g which include VEGF, sVEGFR1, and sVEGFR2 and whole blood for
circulating endothelial cellsubsets (CECs) . In two separate Phase II studies of
renal cell and NSC LCpresented at the2008annual meeting ofthe American
Society forClinical Oncolog y (ASCO) adecrease in sVEGFR2 compared with
baseline wassignificantly correlated with tumor response (p<0.05).37,38In adult
patients with metastatic imatini b-refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated 
with sunitinib, another VEGF and c-kittargeting multityrosine kinase inhibitor, 
biomarker analysis ofCECs, monocytes, VEGF, and sVEGF R-2 were consistently 
modulated by treatment. In this study, changes in CECs and monocytes rather than 
plasma markers differed between the patients with clinical benefit andthose with
progressive disease.39In pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors treated
with pazopanib ,baseline levels ofplasma soluble VEGF R-2andendoglin levels
were significantly decreased when measured after 2weeks oftreatment, while
placenta lgrowth factor levels were significantly increa sed over thesametime 
points. There was nosignificant change inVEGF orplasma soluble VEGF R-1
levels with pazopanib therapy.40
This study will continu e to examine the effects of pazopani b therap y on cytokines 
and angiogenic factors.
In part ,genetic predisposition may account forthe variability inbiomarker or 
clinical response toanti-VEGF treatment. Three lines ofongoin ginvestigation 
justify voluntary collection of DNA in this trial to evaluate relationships between 
discovered associations in theadult population andpazopanib effects inthe 
pediatric population, and to assess age as a covariate in these relationships.
1) Recently, Dr. and  colleagues identified asingle nucleotide 
polymorphis m in KDR (thegene thatencodes VEGFR2) that isreproducibly 
associated with thebaselin elevels ofcirculatin gsoluble VEGFR2 inthree 
separate cohorts: healthy volunteers of the Old Order Amish community; 128 
unrelated cancer patients at the ;and adult RCC patients
enrolled onthephase II trials ofpazopanib. Subsequently, they demonstrated
that inthe RCCpatients treated with pazopanib for 4 weeks, this
polymorphis m isassociated with agreater magnitude decline inplasma 
sVEGFR2 (Late Breakin g Abstract, 2011 A m Soc Clin Pharm& Therapeutics
Meeting). This genotype/phenotype relationship iscurrently being studied by 
another cooperative group (theCALG BPharmacology and Experimental 
Therapeutics Committee) in adult patients who are taking agents in this class.
Determination oftheeffec t ofthis KDR polymorphism and sVEGFR2 degree
ofchange ondisease respo nsetotherapy isongoing.
2) Several genotypes attheVEGF Alocus have been associated with increased 
ordecreased VEGF production andprognostic and predictive markin gof 
treatment outcomes. In most VEGF signaling pathway inhibitor trials 
analyzed sofar,4SNPs in thepromoter region have been evaluated for 
associations with clinical outcomes: -2578, -1498, -1154, and -634. These 
studies have yielded inconsistent findings. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
similar inconsistencies led to confusion onthe predicti verole ofVEGF alleles
until ameta-analysis byLambrechts, etal.41revealed only -2578 to have a
clinically relevant andconsistent effect. Suchstudies inoncolog yare ongoing .

2.4 Pediatric Studies
2.4.1 Pediatric Phase I Studies
TheChildren’s Oncolog yGroup (COG )conducted aphase Istudy ofpazopanib 
inchildren with STS orother refractory solid tumor s(ADVL0815). This study was
performe d to determin ethemaximu mtolerated dose (MTD) oftwo formulations
oforalpazopanib; todefine anddescribe thetoxicities, pharmacodyamics and
pharmacokinetics (PK) ofpazopanib administered as a tablet (Part 1) or powder 
suspension (Part 2a); and to explore pazopanib induced changes intumo r blood
volum e and vascular permeability (Ki) usingdynamic contrast enhanced MRI
(DCE-MRI) in a subset ofpatients with STS(Part 2b). During part 1,pazopanib 
(tablet formulation) wasadministered once daily in28 day cycles at 4 dose levels 
(275 to 600 mg /m2)using therollin g-six design. Dose determination for a powder 
suspension (Part 2a) was initiated at 50% of the MTD fortheintact tablet. Ten
patients withSTS underwent DCE-MRI scanning at baseline and 15 ± 2 days after 
initiation of pazopanib at thetablet MTD (Part 2b). A total of 53 patien tswere
enrolled; 51were eligible [26 male, media nage12.9 yrs (range 3.8 -23.9)].
Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were generally mild. Diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, fatigue, proteinuria and hypertensi onwerethe most commonly reported
side effects. Onlycycle 1DLTswere considered fordetermination of theMTD 
and included Grade 3lipase ,amylase and ALT elevation, proteinuria and
hypertension. One patient with occult brain metastasis intheimaging expansion
cohort also hadGrade 4intracranial hemorrhage . TheMTD was450 mg/m2/dose
fortable ts,and160mg/ m2/dose forpowder suspension; twoisolated andreversible 
Grade 3ALT elevations were seen at the powder suspension dose of 225 mg/
m2/dose. Toxicit ies requiring dose modification and/or discontinuation in later 
cycles included tumor pain (n=2), ALT elevation (n=2), diarrhea, myalgia 
associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ,handfootsyndrome, weight 
loss, fistula formation at a site of prior RT, growth plate abnormality and recurrent
neutropenia (eachn=1). Three of27patients treated attheMTD had asymptomatic
decreases inleftventricular systolic function; allwere reversible andthe drug was
successfully reintroduced in two. Asymptomat icsinus bradycardia was noted in 4
patients, all≥ 12 years. NoQTc prolongation was observed.
Steady state trough concentration (Ctrough) was reached by day 15 and exceeded
15µg/ml at alldose level s. There wasmarke dinter-patient variability inPK 
parameters resulting in substantial overlap betwee n dose levels and trough 
concentrations did not appear dose-dependent. Patien tsreceived 1-22+cycles

(median = 2). One patient each with hepatoblastoma or desmoplastic small round 
and all 5 who received therapy for a year or more had Ctrough ≥30μg/ml. All 
patients with evaluable DCE-MRI (n=8) experienced decreases in tumor blood 
volume and permeability (Ki; p<0.01). PlGF increased, whereas endoglin and 
soluble VEGFR2 decreased (p<0.01; n=31).40
2.4.2 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative Biological Studies 
Hypertension was seen in several patien ts in the pediatric Phase I dose escalation 
study, which is a class effect seen with other VEGF blocking agents. Suchhypertension has been treatable with anti-hypertensives and may ultimately be a 
biomarker of treatment effect. Pediatric specific guidelines for the management 
of VEGF blocking agent-induced hypertension have been developed for other COGDevelopmental Therapeutics studies (e.g. ADVL0413, ADVL0612, ADVL0714,
and ADVL0815) and will be used fo r this trial. In the adult Phase I pazopanib trial,
a relationship between steady-state trough concentrations and the occurrence ofhypertension could be described by a logi stic regression model. Twenty (77%) of
the 26 patients with Ctrough values > 15 μg/mL on Day 22 developed
hypertension, versus 11 (39%) of the 28 patients who had lower Ctrough values.
42
In the pediatric phase I trial, the mean Ctrough in patients with drug relatedhypertension (n=13) was 42±13 g/ml versus 29±13 g/ml in normotensive patients (n=27; p=0.008), suggesting a relationship between blood pressureelevation and drug exposure. In addition pediatric patients with a best response of 
stable disease had a 30% incidence of blood pressure elevation within the first two 
cycles, and 47% incidence over all cycles. This trial will seek to expand ourunderstanding of the relationship of pazopa nib Ctrough to hypertension, and the 
utility of hypertension as a pharmacodynamic or predictive marker.
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Phase II Trial
This is a two-stage open label phase II trial of pazopanib in children, adolescents and young 
adults with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Tumors of primary interest are 
rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma (including synovial sarcoma,
alveolar soft part sarcoma and desmoplastic small round cell tumor) and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral
PNET. Tumors of secondary interest include hepa toblastoma, neuroblastoma (measurable and 
evaluable), and osteosarcoma.
Each tumor type defines a cohort resulting in 7 total cohorts. The first stage of the study involves 
enrolling an initial 10 patients into each cohort. The response rate will be d etermined for each cohort
after the target enrollment of 10 patients is r eached for that cohort. If one or more confirmed
responses are observed in the first 10 evaluable p atients in a cohort, an additional 10 patients will 
be enrolled into that cohort in the second stage of study. Thus, for cohort(s) with one or more
confirmed responses in the first stage of study, a total of 20 patients will be enrolled and evaluated to determine efficacy.
Eligible patients will receive pazopanib monothe rapy. Pazopanib will be dosed daily as an oral 
tablet (450 mg/m
2/dose, maximum 800 mg) or as a powder for oral suspension (225 mg/m2/dose, 
maximum 400 mg) in 28 day cycles.
The MTD for pazopanib tablets was 450 mg/m2/dose as determined by ADVL0815/PZP114411, 
the COG Phase I study in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. For the powder suspension formulation, the selected starting dose is  higher than the protoc ol-defined  MTD of 160 
mg/m
2/dose established in ADVL0815. This decision is driven by the considerations that the 160
Novartis Confidential Page 29
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
isolated and reversible laborator y-defined DLTs were observed at the 225 mg/ m2/dose.
Thefirst patients who are enrolled to receive pazopanib as powder suspension at 225 mg/m2/dose 
daily willbeclosel ymonitored forsafet yandforthe occurrence ofdose-limiting toxicity during 
thefirstcycle(28days) oftherapy . Patient swhoeithe rreceiv e225 mg /m2/dose daily for atleast 24
days(85% ofthedose fora 28-day cyclewith powder suspension at225 mg/m2/dose) orare 
withdrawn fromdosing due to one or m oreprotoco l-defined dose-limiting toxicities (Section 5.1) 
during thefirst cycle will beconsidered evaluable forthepurpose ofthis safet yreview. Six
evaluable patients are required.
The firstpatients enrolled toreceive powder suspension at225mg/m2/dose willalso beexpected 
tocomplete extended PKsamplin g(Section 7.3.2)withblood samples collected prior todosing, 
and30min, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8hours after thepazopani bdose onDay 1andDay 15 ± 1 day of 
Cycle 1(with nopazopani bdose modification oradjustment inthe10daysbefore Cycle 1Day
15samplecollection). Patients who canprovide adequate blood samples for the2scheduled 
extended PKcollections will be considered to be evaluable patients forthepurpose ofthisPK
analysis, and PK dataarerequire dfrom 6 evaluable patients. Ifone or more of thefirst 6patients 
fails toprovid eblood samples asspecifie d inthe protocol or if it is know nthatforsomereaso na 
patient’s collected blood sample(s) cann ot be analyzed , that patien twill be determine d to be non-
evaluable for this analysis, and one or more additional patients will be enrolled for treatment with 
pazopanib as powder suspension for the purpose of obtaining the extended PK samples.
Because patients receiving thepowder suspension enrolled inthesafetyreview group may be 
different fromthose inthePKanalysis group, enrollmen tonto powder suspension mayfollow 
several different paths:
If ≥ 2 out of 6 evaluable patients have dose-limiting toxicities (DLT andasdefined in 
Section 5.1) within the first cycle, then enrollment onto 225 mg/m2/dose pazopanib will
be halted. Subsequent new patients willbeenrolled atthe 160mg/m2/dose level until 6
evaluable patients fromthisdose groupare available forthesafetyreview and 6 patients 
are available for PK analysis at 160 mg/ m2/dose.
If 6 PKevaluable patients areenrolled prior toenrollment of 6 patients whoare 
evaluable for the safety revie w, the extended PK sample collection may besuspended.
If < 2 DLTs areobserve dduring thefirst cycle in 6 patients evaluable forsafetyat225
mg/m2/dose and these 6patients are not allevaluable forthePKanalysis, then 
enrollment will continue until 6 PK evaluable patients are available.
Allpatients will beclosel y monitored with clinica land laboratory observations foradverse 
events.
Tumor response will beevaluated usingappropriate imagin gassessments atbaseline, prior to
Cycle 3, Cycle 5, Cycle 8, Cycle 11 and then every 3rdcycle thereafter.
 
Inaddition, wewillassess KDR polymorphis mand 
pazopanib -induced chang e in soluble VEGFR2; VEGF-A genotype and changes inVEGF -A 
concentration; KDR andVEGF -Agenotypes andresponse rate, andprogression -freesurvival; 
and candidate SNPs and clinical endpoints as identified in the adult population.
Theprimary analys iswill beperformed 20weeks after thelastpatient’s first visit inthethree 
cohorts of primar yinterest (rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcomatous softtissue sarcoma 
and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET).
Thestudywillbecomplete doneyear fromthedate ofthelastpatient’s first visit andtheendof 
study analysis will be performed at the time of study completion.

4 TREATMENT PROGRAM
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan
Pazopanib willbe dosed daily as anoraltablet at450mg/m2/dose oras apowde rfororal suspension 
at 225 mg/m2/dose.
Forthetablet formulation, themaximu mtolerated dose (MTD) was450mg/m2/dose as determined
byADVL0815/PZP114411, theCOGPhase I study. Themaximu mdose tobe administered daily 
for tablets is 800 mg.
For the powder suspension formulation, the selected starting dose is 225 mg/m2/dose, higher than
theprotoco l-specified MTD of 160 mg/m2/dose established instudyADVL081 5.This decision is
driven by theconsiderations thatthe160mg/m2/dose may result inexposure that issuboptimal to
demonstrate efficacy andthatonly twoisolated andreversible laborator y-defined dose-limiting  
toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the 225 mg/m2/dose . The maximum dose tobeadministered
daily fororalsuspension is400mg.
Note : The first patient s enrolle d who receiv epowder suspension willbereviewe dforsafety and
will be expected to complete extended PKsampling (Section 7.3.2). A minimu m of 6 evaluable
patients forsafetyand 6evaluable patient sforPKarerequired asdescribe din section 2.5.
Safety andPKdata fromthese patients will bereviewed prior tofurth er enrollment ofpatients
requirin gpowder suspension todetermine ifthe225 mg/m2/dose is tolerated andifthePK
exposure issimila r toexposure inadults associated withclinical efficacy. If 225 mg/m2/dose isnot
tolerated (≥2patients withDLTs in the first 6evaluable patients durin gtheir firstcycle ),all
subsequently enrolled patients will receive 160 mg/m2/dose, and an additional 6 subjects will be 
assessed for safety and PK.
Patients willtake pazopanib continuousl y,once daily. Acycle willbedefined as 28 days with no
restperiods betwee ncycles. Patients with benefit (stable diseas eoran objective response) may 
continue therapy unless there is evidence ofprogressive disease or unacceptable treatmen t-related
toxicit y,death oruntil study closure defined as1 year after Last Patient First Visit.
Patients must remain onthesame formulation ofpazopanib throughout theduration of
their protocol therapy.
Drugdosing forthe tablet formulation should bedetermine dusing the dosin gnomogra min 
Appendix II. Forpatients receiving powder forsuspension (50mg/mL),thedose willbe rounded 
to the neares t 5 mg. Drug doses shoul d be adjusted based on the BSA as determined bytheheight
andweight obtaine dwithin 1 weekprior tothebeginnin g of each cycle.
Pazopanib shoul dbetaken on anempt ystomach (atleast 1hour before ameal or 2 hours after
ameal) atapproximately thesametime each day.Pazopanib tablets shoul d be taken with clear
liquids (approximately 4 ounces for children < 12 ye arsofageand4-8 ounces for children ≥12
years of age). Pazopanib suspension should betaken according toinstructions inAppendi x VII.Timingofprotoco ltherapy administration, response assessmen tstudies, andsurgical interventions ar ebased on 
schedule sderive dfromtheexperimenta ldesig n or on establishe dstandard s ofcare. Mino runavoidabl edeparture s
(up t o 72 hours) fromprotocol directe dtherapy and/or disease evaluations (and upto 1 weekforsurgery)
forvalid clinical, patient andfamily logistical, or facility, procedur e and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are
acceptable (except where explicitly prohibited within theprotocol) .This doesNOTapply toeligibility
requirements; but totherapy and evaluations post consent andpost thestart ofprotocol directed care. Novartis
willnotgrant protocol waivers.
Novartis Confidential Page 41
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
Thepazopanib suspensio nshould be swirled foratleast 30 seconds prior toremoval ofthedose 
from thebottle, which shoul d begiven immediately. If apatient vomits after a dose of pazopanib, 
the dose should notbe repeated.
Apatient diary (see Append ices IA andIB)should becompleted bythepatient or their guardian
and collected at the end of each cycle.
See Section 5for Dose Modifications in Response to Toxicities
4.1.1 Dose Reduction
Forpatients who receive pazopanib tablet s: Dosereductio n(s) in response to toxicity
may be im plemented according toguidance inSections 5.2,5.3,and5.4 oftheprotocol.
Outside thespecific managemen tguidance described in these sections, patients who 
recove r from an adverse ev ent to starting criteria as outlined inSection 4.2withi n 14
days following planned administration willalso bepermitted to receive protocol 
therapy at a reduced dose. Dose reduction (s)will bebased on thestartin gdose and
should follow theDosing Nomogra min Appendix II.
Note :For patient s receivin g pazopani b tablet s at a starting dose of 400 mg, there will 
only be one allowed dose reduction due to tablet size.
For patients who receive pazopanib as oral powder for suspension:
Dose reduction(s) inresponse totoxicity may be implemented according to guidance 
in Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 of the protocol. Outside the specific management guidance
described inthese sections, patients whorecover froman adverse event to startin g 
criteria as outlined in Section 4.2 within 14 days following planned administration will 
also be permitted to receive protocol therapy at a reduced dose. Dose reduction(s)
will bebased onthestarting dose and should follow the guidance in Table 1 and 
Table 1a.
Table 1:Dose Reduction forToxicit y if powder suspension startingdose is 225 
mg/m2
Starting Dose 225 mg/m2/dose
First Dose Reduction 160mg/m2/dose
Second Dose Reduction 135 mg/m2/dose

been reduced to 160 mg/ m2
Starting Dose 160mg/m2/dose
First Dose Reduction 135mg/m2/dose
Anysubsequent dose reduction would need to be discussed andagreed bythe 
Study Chair.
4.1.2 Dose Escalation
Dose escalations will not be allowed.
4.1.3 Treatment Interruptions
Iftheprotocol therapy hasbeen interrup tedfor more than 14 days due to toxicity or 
Novartis Confidential Page 42
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
for reasons other than toxicity (unplanned travel or vacation, or lack oftransportation 
to the site), the Study Chair must be notified to review the patient’s condition inorder 
toresum etreatment. Incases oftoxicity, re-challenge ata reduceddose ispossible if 
thepatient’s condition hasbeen stable andhasnot deteriorated and the patient must 
have recovered from thetoxicity (Section 4.2).
Ifthe protocol thera pyhasbeen interrupted formorethan 28days,thepatient 
should bepermanently discontinued fromprotocol therapy andwill continue tobe 
followed for survival.
4.1.4 Missed Doses
Missed doses should be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
If adose ismissed, thepatient should take thedose assoon aspossible, butonly if
there are 12 or morehours leftbefore thenext dose isdue. Ifthenext dose is due in
less than 12hours ,thepatien tshould skip themissed dose andtake the next dose
as scheduled.
4.1.5 Study Specific Supportive Care
4.1.5.1 Management ofHypertension :The algorith m in Section 5.4.1 will be used
tograde andmanag e pazopanib -related hypertension. Should initiation of
anti-hypertensive therapy berequired, singl e agent therapy (commonly 
including thecalciu mchannel blockers amlodipine or nifedipine, which are
permissible without notifying theStudychair) should bestarted and theblood
pressure shoul dbemonitored atleast twice weekl yuntil BP is within the
95th percentile forage, height, and gender per Section 5.4.1.
Ifpatient isalread y on an ant i-hypertensive medication at study enrollment, 
then their anti-hypertensive therapy shoul d be adjusted (by either adjusting
the dose oftheir curren tanti-hypertensive medication or by adding another
anti-hypertensive agent) according tothealgorith m in Section 5.4.1.
4.1.5.2 Management of Hypothyroidis m:Patients with Grade 2hypothyroid ism 
should beevaluated byanendocrinologist for further management. Patients
with Grade 2hypothyroidism adequately manage d with thyroid hormone
replacement may continue on protocol therapy .Patients with Grade 3 or 
greater hypothyroidis m attributable to pazopanib will be considered tohave
had a dose-limiting toxicity. These patients shoul dbe manage daccording to
Section 5.3andshould also beevaluated byan endocrinologist for further
management . IfGrade 3 orgreater hypothyroidism is adequately 
manage d with thyroid hormone replacement and improves to grade 2 or less, 
pazopanib may be restarted.
4.1.5.3 Treatment ofpalme r-plantar erythrodysesthesia (Han d-foot syndrom e): Oral
administration ofvitami n B 6 (pyridox ine)may be considered for patients
whodevelop palma r-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand -foot) syndrome:
 BSA <0.5 m2:50 mg per day
 BSA 0.5-1.0 m2:100 mg per day
 BSA >1.0 -1.5 m2:200 mg per day

4.1.5.4 Blood -product Support: Patients should besupported with transfusion of 
blood andblood products (including platelet transfusion) per institutional 
standard s.
4.1.5.5 Supportive Care:General supportive care should be provided accord ing to 
institutional standards. The COG Study Chair or Novartis Medical Leadcan
be contacte dfor specific questions regarding supportive care.
4.2 Criteria for S tarting Subsequent Cycles
A cycle may be repeated every 28 days if the patient has at least stable disease or progressive 
disease is ruled out based on clinical or laboratory evidence andmetthe clinical and 
laboratory parameters asdefined bythe guidelines for dose modification and toxici ty 
management (Section 5)anddoes not have a dose limiting toxicit yrequiring permanent
removal from protocol therap y (Section 5.1). Apatient may resume protocol therapy atthe
sameorareduced dose iftheyhave a toxici tythat isadequately manage d(eg:
myelosuppression, hypertension, hepatotoxicity, electrolyte abnormality ,bleeding, wound
healing ,etc)asoutlined in Sections 5.2,5.3,and5.4.
4.3 Concomitant Therapy
Ifnew data become available showin gan interaction between a concomitant medication and 
pazopanib that isconsidered significant enough toimpact therisk/benefit balance of 
pazopanib, the listofpermitted/prohibited medications intheInvestigator Brochure willbe 
updated either durin gtheannual update orwithin anIB supplement. Anysuch changes will 
be communicated to the site via aletter which should be stored in the site’s study file.
4.4 Permitted Medications
Allpatientswill beasked toprovide acomplete listofprescription andover-the-counter 
medications that have beentaken within theprevi ous 4 weeks prior toScreening. The 
investigator must beinforme dassoon aspossible abou t anynew medication(s ) taken from 
the time of Screening until the completion of the post -treatment follo w-up visit.
All concomitant medication stakenduring thestudywill berecorde d in theeCRFwith 
indication, dose information, and dates of administration.
Patients shoul dreceive fullsupportive care during thestudy, including transfusion ofblood 
andblood products, treatment with antibiotics, analgesics, erythropoietin, or bisphosphonates, 
when appropriate.
Anti-emetics (such asprochlorperazine, lorazepam , ondansetron orother 5-HT 3 
antagonists) may beadministered prophylactically inthe event ofnausea. However , it is 
important tonote that5-HT3blockers thataregivendaily for a prolonged perio d of time 
may prolong QTc andshould beused with caution. (Appendix IIIB).Anti-diarrheals, such 
as loperamide, may be administered as needed in the event of diarrhea. Although 
acetaminophen atdoses of2 g/dayispermitted, itshoul d be used withcaution inpatien ts 
with impaired liver function.
4.5 Permitted Medications –Use with Ca ution
4.5.1 Specific recommendations regarding anticoagulants:
Results fromdrug-drug interaction studies conducte d inpatien tswith cancer suggest
Novartis Confidential Page 44
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
that pazopanib hasnoeffec t onthe metabolis m of S- warfarin. Hemorrhagic events,
however ,have been reporte d in clinical studies with pazopanib. T herefore, ifthe
investigator decides tocontinue pazopanib and anticoagulants use concomitantly, it
should beused with caution inpatien tswith increased risk of severe bleeding or
who arebenefittin gfromtreatment and require theinitiation ofconcomitant 
anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin orits derivatives, low molecular weight heparin, 
unfractionated heparin) while on study.Note: Patient sare excluded fromenrolling
on thestudy iftheyaretaking therapeutic doses of S- warfarin atthetime ofscreening.
Patients taking concomitant anticoagulant therapy should be monitored regularl yfor
changes in relevant coagulation parameters as clinicall y indicated , as well as for any 
clinical bleeding episodes.
4.5.2 Specific recommendations regarding hypoglycemic therapy including insulin: 
Results fromdrug-drug interaction studies conducte d in patien tswith cancer
suggest thatthere will b e no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between 
pazopanib andhypog lycemi c agents. Transient decreases inserum glucose (mainly
Grade 1and 2,rarely Grade 3) have been observed inclinical studies with pazopanib. 
In addition, decreases in blood sugar have been report ed inpatien ts treated with 
another small molecule tyrosine ki nase inhibitor, sunitinib (British JournalofCance r
2008: 99, 1380). Suchchanges mayrequir ean adjustment inthe dose of
hypog lycemic and/or insulin therapy. Patients should beadvised toreport symptom s
ofhypoglycemi a(e.g., confusion, visual disturbances, palpitations, andsweating). 
Serumglucose should be tested during treatment with pazopanib as outlined in the 
protocol and as clinically indicated.
4.5.3 Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations 
andshould be undertaken with caution andclose monitoring. Ifa patient receiving 
concomitant simvastatin develops ALT elevations, follow dosing guidelines for 
pazopanib or consider disconti nuing simvastatin.
4.5.4 Concomitant administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole decreases the 
bioavailability of pazopani b by 40% (AUCandCmax). Co- administration of 
pazopanib with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) should be avoided. Co-
administration of pazopani b with PPIs is PROHIBITED from 24 hours before
thefirst dose ofpazopanib until after thefinalPKblood sampl e iscollected on
Day 15 ± 1 day ofCycl e 1.After this, iftheconcomitant useof a proto n-pump
inhibitor (PPI) ismedically necessary, it isrecommended thatthedose ofpazopanib
be ta kenwithout food once daily intheevenin gconcomitantly with thePPI (Section
4.8). If the concomitant administration ofanH2-receptor antagonist ismedically
necessary, pazopanib shoul d be takenwithout food atleast 2hours before orat
least 10 hours after a dose of an H2-receptor antagonis t. Pazopanib should be
administered atleast 1hourbefore or 2 hoursafter administration ofshort -acting 
antacids.
4.5.5 Concurrent Anti-Hypertensive Therapy: Thealgorith m in Section 5.4.1 willbe 
used tograde andmanag epazopanib related hypertension. Shoul dinitiation of 
anti-hypertensive therapy berequired, single agent therapy (commonl yincluding the
calciu mchannel blockers amlodipine ornifedipine) may be started without notifying 
the study chair.
Novartis Confidential Page 45
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
4.5.6 Anti- inflammatory and anti -platelet agents (e.g. aspirin, and/or ibuprofen, or other 
NSAIDs) could result in elevated blood pressure or increased bleeding episodes 
when co -administered with pazopanib and therefore should be used with caution.
4.5.7 Patients’ medications should be reviewed at eligibility, before treatment initiation, 
and during treatment. Any concomitant medications that are “generally accepted” to
cause a risk ofTorsade depointes areprohibited (see Appendix IIIB).Thos e
“associated” with arisk of QTc prolongation and/or Torsades de pointes should be
discontinued orreplaced with drugsthat do not carrythese risks, ifpossible.
Patients who musttake these medications should bewatc hed carefully forsymptom s 
of QTc prolongation, such assyncope. Performing additional EKG son patients who
musttake oneormore ofthese medications is recommended but not required, at the 
investigator’s discretion.
4.6 The Effects of Pazopanib on Other Drugs
In vitro data indicate that pazopanib is a potentia l inhibitor for CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2D6,
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C 19,CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP2E1. Pregnane X receptor 
transient transfection assay suggested some potential for human CYP3A4 induction at high 
concentrations. Results from drug -drug interaction studies conducted in patien tswith cancer
suggest thatpazopanib isaweak inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, andCYP2D 6in vivo,but 
hadnoclinically relevant effect on CYP1A2 ,CYP2C 9 orCYP2C19 metabolism. Therefore, 
concomitant use ofpazopanib with certain medications (substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8,
andCYP2D6 ) with a narro wtherapeuti cwindow should beundertaken with CAUTIO Ndue
tothepotential foralterations inthepharmacologic effects of these medicat ions oran
increased riskforserious orlife-threatening adverse events associated with such medications
(seebelow) secondar y totheinhibition ofspecificCYPenzyme sby pazopanib. Inaddition,
thepotential fordruginteraction with such medications , although diminished, maypersist
after thelastdose ofpazopani b due to itslong half-life (i.e., mean 30.9 hours); therefore, 
continue to exercise CAUTIO Nfor atleast 7daysand up to 15 days after thelastdose of
pazopanib whenadministering these medications. These medications include (but are not 
limited to):
 Ergot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine 
(potential increased risk for developing ergot toxicity that includes severe vasospasm 
leading to peripheral as w ell as cerebral ischemia)
 Neuroleptics: pimozide (potential increased risk for QT interval prolongation, 
ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death)
 Antiarrhythmics: bepridil, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, amiodarone, quinidine, 
propafenone (potential increased risk for QT interval prolongation and Torsade de 
Pointes)
 Immune modulators: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus (potential increased risk for 
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity)
 Miscellaneous: quetiapine, risperidone, clozapine, atomoxetine.
4.7 The Effe cts of Other Drugs on Pazopanib
Results frominvitro studies suggest thattheoxidative metabolis m of pazopani b in human 
liver microsome s is mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A 2
and CYP2C8. Furthermore, invitro data suggestthat pazopanib isasubstrate for P-
glycoprotein andforbreast cancer resistance protei n.Substances that induce orinhibit 
CYP3A 4 ma y alter thepharmacologic effects ofpazopani bandshoul dbe used with 
CAUTIO N.
Novartis Confidential Page 46
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
Medications that inhibit CYP3A 4 may resul t inincreased plasm apazopanib concentrations. 
Co-administration ofstron gCYP3A 4inhibitors isprohibite d(see Sectio n4.8);therefore 
selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minima lpotentia l to inhibit 
CYP3A4 isrecommended.
Medications thatinduce CYP3A 4may result indecreased plasm apazopanib concentrations 
andalossofefficacy andtherefore areprohibited (See Section 4.8).Anticonvulsant drugs 
that do not i nduc eCYP enzyme s areallowed. Refer to Appendix IIIAfor alistof 
anticonvulsant drugswith little or no enzym einduction. The use ofazithromycin or 
fluconazole is discouraged but allowed.
4.8 Prohibited Medications
Patients should notreceiv eother anti-cancer therap y [cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or 
hormonal (other than leuprolide orother GnRHagonists)] while ontreatment in thisstudy. 
Medications thatinhibit CYP3A 4 ma y result inincreased plasm apazopanib concentrations; 
therefore, co-administration ofstrong CYP3A 4inhibitors is PROHIBITED beginning 14 
days prior tothefirst dose of protocol therapy until discontinuation oftheprotocol therap y. 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include (but are not limited to ):
 Antibiotics : clarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomyci n,roxithromycin
 HIV protease inhibitors: ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, 
lopinavir
 Antifungals: itraconzaole, ketoconazole, voriconazole
 Antidepressants: nefazodone
CYP3A 4inducers may decrease plasm apazopani bconcentrations. Selectio nof an alternate
concomitant medication with noorminimal enzym e induction potential is recommended.
Drugs that induce CYP3A4 and may decrease pazopani bplasma concentrations are
PROHIBITE D an d include (but are not limited to ):
 Glucocorticoids forgreater than 2weeks duratio n: cortisone (>50 mg/day), 
hydrocortisone (>40 mg /day), prednisone (>10 mg/day), methylprednisolone (>8 
mg/day), dexamethasone (>1.5 m g/day)
 Anticonvulsant s: phenytoin, carbamezepine, phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine, 
primidone, fosphenytoin
 HIV antiviral s: efavirenz, nevirapine, tipranavir
 Antibiotics :rifampin (rifampicin), rifabutin, rifapentene
 Miscellaneous: St.John’s Wort, modafinil, pioglitazone
Grapefruit orgrapefruit juice isprohibited asitinhibi tsCYP3A 4activit yandmayalso 
increase plasma concentrations of pazopanib.
Asnoted above, co-administration ofpazopanib with PPIs should be avoided and is
prohibite d from 24 hours before the first dose of pazopanib until after the final PK blood 
sample is collected on Day 15 ± 1 day of Cycle 1.

5 DEFINITIONS AND DOSE MODIFICATION FOR TOXICITY
All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. The severity of adverse 
events will be graded utilizing the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE, version 4.
The cycle duration remains 28 consecutive days in patien ts who have dose interruption.
5.1 Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DL T)
DLT willbedefine das an y of thefollowing events thatare at least possibly, probably, or
definitely attributable topazopanib. See Section 5.4forthePotential Pazopanib Specific 
Side Effect s. Dose -limiting hematological and non-hem atological toxicit iesaredefined 
differently.
5.1.1 Hematological Dose -Limiting Toxicity
a) For patients who areevaluable forhematologic toxicity assessment (patients
without bone marrow involvement)
 Grade 4Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <25,000/mm3 ) or Grade 4 
neutropenia
 Any hematologic toxicit y requiring dose reduction or treatment interruption 
for >14 days
b) For all patients:
 ≥Grade 2arterial thromboembolic events (visceral arterial ischemia, 
peripheral ischemia, or ischemia cerebrovascular)
 Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic event
 Any thrombotic event (other than central venou s line [CVL] associated 
thrombosis) requiring systemic anticoagulation
5.1.2 Non-Hematological Dose -Limiting Toxicity
5.1.2.1 AnyGrade 4 non- hematologic toxicity
5.1.2.2 AnyGrade 3non-hem atological toxicit y,with thespecifi cexclusion of the 
following:
 Grade 3 nausea and vomiting of less < 3 days duration
 Grade 3 fever or infecti on,
 Grade 3 hypophosphatemia ,hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or 
hypomagnesemia responsive tooralsupplementation within 7days
of start of s upplemen t(see Section 5.4.4 for dose modification s)
5.1.2.3 Grade 2 allergic reaction sthat necessitate discontinuation ofprotocol 
therapy will not be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.
5.1.2.4 AnyGrade 2 non-hem atological toxicity that persistsfor≥ 7days andis 
considered sufficiently medically significant orsufficiently intolerable b y
patients thatitrequires treatment interruption mayalsobeconsidered aDLT
following discussio nwith theStudychair and aNovartis Medical L ead.
5.1.2.5 Hypertension will begrade daccording totheNCICTCA E;however, 
dose limiting hypertension will be considered as the following:
Novartis Confidential Page 51
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
 Grade 4 hypertension
 Ablood pressure >25 mmH gabove the 95th percentile for age, 
height, and gender (see Appendix V) confirmed by repe ated
measurement onthesameday(See Sections 5.4.1 and4.1.5.1 for 
management)
 In patients already on anti-hypertensive therap y due to previous 
hypertension (seeSection 3.2.8.5 ),anyblood pressure 1-25 mmH g
above the95th percentile forage, height, andgender ( Appendix V) 
for > 14 days (See Sections 5.4.1 a nd4.1.5.1 formanagement)
5.2 Dose Modifications forHematologic Toxicity
All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity.
Pazopanib tablets :Forstep-wise dose reductions, seeAppendix IIfor the dosing nomogra m. 
Pazopanib powder insuspension : For step -wise dose reductions see Tables 1 and 1a(Section 
4.1.1) .
5.2.1 For allpatients:
If Grade 4 neutropenia occurs,                                                          
a) Pazopanib should be held.
b) CBC sshould bechecked atleast twice aweek(ever y 3 to 4 days)
until ANC ≥ 750/µL.
c) Subsequent doses ofpazopani bshould begiven at a reduced dose, when
ANC ≥ 750 /µL.
If Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurs,                                         
a) Pazopanib should be held.
b) CBC sshould bechecked atleast twice aweek(ever y 3 to 4 days) until
platelet count ≥75,000 /Lwithout need forplatelet transfusion in the 
preceding 7 days.
Subsequent doses ofpazopani bshould begiven at a reduced dose, when 
platelet count ≥ 75,000 /Lwithout need for platelet transfusion in the 
preceding 7 days.
5.2.1.1 If dose- limiting myelosuppression occurs asnoted in Section 5.1.1 ,
a) The dose ofpazopanib should beresume d at a reduced dose, once
ANC ≥ 750/ Land platelet count ≥75,000 /Lwithout need for 
platelet transfusion in the preceding 7 da ys.
5.2.2 For patients who have a dose limiting hematological toxicity that does not resolve to
theparameters defined in Section 5.2.1within 14days ofholding pazopani b:if re-
challenge is to be considere dtheStudy Chairmustbe contacted and provide approval 
prior to re- challenge.
5.3 Dose Modifications for Non-Hematological Toxicity
Specific instructions forthemanagement ofpotential pazopanib side effects areincluded in
Section 5.4.
Novartis Confidential Page 52
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
5.3.1 For any non -hematologic dose limiting toxicity as detailed in Section 5.1.2:
a) Pazopanib should be held
b) I f the non-hem atologic DLT is a pazopanib specific toxicity, thedosing 
guidelines in Section 5.4 should be followed
c) If the non-hem atologic DLT returns tobaseline within 14 days ofholding 
pazopanib, subsequent doses of pazopanib should be given at areduced dose.
 Iftoxicity does notresolve tomeet continued treatment parameters 
within 14days ofdrug discontinuation, and if re- challenge is to be
conside red,theStudyChair must becontacted asoutlined inSection 4.2 
to discuss.
 If DLT recurs in a patient who has resume d treatment after the maximu m
allowed dose reduc tions, the patient must beremoved fromprotocol
therap y,unless thepatient has been approv edfora further dose 
reduction following discussion with the Study Chair.
5.4 Potential Pazopanib Specific Side Effects
5.4.1 Hypertension
 Baseline blood pressure (BP) isdefined asthebloodpressure obtained at the
examination used for study enrollment. This baseline BP should be obtained as 
follows:
1) Obtain 3serial blood pressures fromthesameextremity with thepatient in
thesame positio n that are separated b y at least 5 minutes .Avoid using the 
lower extremity if possible.
2) Average the systolic blood pressure from the 2ndand 3rdmeasurements.
3) Average the diastolic blood pressure from the 2ndand 3rdmeasurements.
4) Thebaseline BP is theaverage ofthesystolic over theaverage of the 
diastolic measurements.
 Elevation in either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure should be considered 
when following the algorithm below.
 The upper limit ofnormal (ULN )isdefined asa BP equal tothe95th
percentile for age, height, and gender. If ≥ 18 yrs of age, ULN will be defined 
as a BP of 140/90. See Appendix V.
 TheNCICTCAE version 4.0will beutilized todetermine thegrade of 
hypertension for reporting purposes.
 Elevated BPmeasurements should berepeated onthesameday to confirm the
elevation. Patients withanelevated BPshould have BPmeasurements performed 
at least twice weekly until BP is≤ ULN.
 The algorithm below will be used to manage pazopanib related hypertension.
 Hypertension shoul d be manage dwith appropriate anti-hypertensive agent(s) as 
clinically indicated. It is strongly recommended that nephrology or cardiology be 
consulted in the evaluation and management of hypertension.
 For patients who were on one anti-hypertensive medication at study enrollment 
and hypertension worsen s while on study , further ant i-hypertensive therapy may
include dose adjustment ofthecurrent medication or the addition of a second 
anti-hypertensive medicatio n.

o If the BP increases to > 25 m m Hg above the ULN despite anti-
hypertensive therapy ,hold pazopanib, but continue theanti-hypertensi ve 
agent(s). Monitor the BP asclinicall yindicated andfollow Arm 4 of the 
algorithm from the point that pazopanib is held.
 IftheBPis≤ULNwithin 14days, pazopani bmay be restarted atareduced 
dose.
 Ifthe BP is > ULNfor > 14 days,thepatien tmust be removed from protocol 
therapy (Section 8.1).
Arm4 of algorithm:
 If BP is > 25 mm Hg above theULNholdpazopanib, monitor BP, and 
administer/adjust anti -hypertensive therapy as clinically indicated.
o If the BP returns to ≤ ULN within 14 days, pazopanib may be restarted 
at areduced dose.
o IftheBP is > ULNfor>14 days, thepatient must be remo vedfrom 
protocol therapy (Section 8.1).
Arm5 of algorithm:
If the participant develops Grade 4 hypertension, discontinue pazopanib, monitor
BPandadministe ranti-hypertensive therapy asclinically indicated. A nephrology
and/or cardiolog yconsult isrecommende d. Thepatient mustbe removed from
Protocol Therapy (Section 8.1).
5.4.2 Abdominal pain:
Abdominal pain is acommo nsympto mwith vascular endothelial growt hfactor 
(VEGF) receptor antagonists such aspazopanib. Bowe lperforations have
been reported inclinical trials ofpazopanib andwithother agents inthisclass.
Bowel perforations have been associated insomepatients with tumor inthe
bowel wall, or diverticul itis, while in others there has been no clear explanation.
Although bowel perforatio nisarare event, investigators andstudystaff at
the siteareadvised tobevigilant ofthispotential complication inpatients 
receiving pazopanib. Abdomina lcomplaints should beassessed during AE
review atevery visit. Inaddition, everyphysical examshould include a
complete abdom inal exam .Forpatients with abdominal complaints and/or
abnormal findings on clinical exam, follow the dose modifications and 
evaluatio ns described below.

Liver imaging (Ultrasound)
3.Monitor patient closely for clinical signs and 
symptoms
4.Perform LFTs1weekly (or more frequently if 
clinically indicated) until ALT reduced to <
Grade 1
5.Pazopanib may be held for up to 14days, if ALT 
returns to <  Grade 1 and patient is benefitting 
from treatment, pazopanib may be resumed at a 
reduced dose following Novartis / Study Chair
approval (contact the Sponsor Medical L ead
and the Study Chair via email or phone to 
start the approval process). If approval f or re-
treatment is granted, the patient must be re -
consented (with a separate informed consent) 
specific to hepatotoxicity.
For patients on tablets dose reductions are as 
follows:
oIf on 800 mg, then reduce to 400 mg 
daily
oIf on 600 mg, then reduce to 400 mg 
daily
oIf on 400 mg, reduce to 200 mg daily
For patients on powder suspension:
oFollow the sequential dose reduction 
(Section 4.1.1.), one dose level reduction 
is required (e.g. from 225 mg/m2 to 160

4. Monitor patient closely for clinical signs 
and symptoms. Perform full panel LFTs1
weekl yor more frequently if clinically 
indicated until LFTs are reduced to 
Grade 1.
For isolated total bilirubin2 elevation witho ut
concurrent ALTincrease (defined asGrade 1ALT
≤3 x ULN).1. Isolated hyperbilirubinemia (in the absence of 
elevated ALT or other signs/symptoms of liver 
injury) does not require dose modification.
Study treatment inhibits UGT1A1 and
OATP1B1, which can cause elevation of
indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin in the absence 
of liver injury
2. If total bilirubin is >1.5 ULN in the absence of 
ALT elevation, fractionation of bilirubin should 
be performed. 
If the bilirubin is predominantly indirect 
(≥65%) indirect (unconjugated), continue 
study treatment at the same dose.
If bilirubin is >35% direct (conjugated), 
study treatment may also be continued 
however, further evaluation should be 
undertaken for underlying cause of 
cholestasis.
1LFTs include: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT andtotal bilirubin.
2Serumbilirubin fractionation should beperformed iftestin gisavailable. Iftesting isunavailable and a
patient meets thecriterion oftotal bilirubin >1.5xULN, then theevent should beprom ptlyreported asdefined.
3When aliver chemistry event meets theLiver Even tInterruption Criteria, orLiver Event Stopping Criteria,
blood samples shoul d be obtained forclinical laboratory testing bythecentral laboratory (Liver Event
Kits willbeprovided forthispurpose).
4These extra tests willbeperformed centrally
5.4.4 Electrolyte Abnormalities:
Serum K+, Ca++, Mg++, phos phate levels should bemonitored giventherisk of 
prolonged QTc. If serum Ca++ isabnormal, ionized calcium should beobtained and 
interventions based on ionized calcium only.
Pazopanib should be held and an EKG obtained for

 Hypokalemia orhyperkalemia ≥ Grade 2
 Hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia ≥ Grade 3
 Hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia ≥ Grade 3
 Hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia ≥Grade 3
These laboratory values should becorrected assoon aspossible in a manner 
consistent with goodmedical judgment. Pazopanib may beresumed atareduced dose 
when:
 Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia is Grade 1 or within institutional limits
 Hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia is ≤ Grade 2
 Hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia is ≤ Grade 2
 Hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia is ≤ Grade 2.
Eventhough pazopanib administration isallowed atthese lower laboratory toxicity
grades, everyeffor tshould bemade to correct the abnormal labvalues to normal if 
possible.
5.4.5 Proteinu ria:
 Ifurinalysis shows ≥trace protein then obtain a urine protein: creatinine 
ratio (UPC ).
 If the UPC is ≥ 1, then obtain a 24-hour urine collection for protein 
estimation.
 Iftheurine protei nis≥3.5g/24-hours then hold pazopani bandre-
assess urine protein weekl y.
 Iftheurine protein decreases to < 3.5g/24 hours in < 21 days then
resume pazopanib at areduced dose.
 Monitor the24hour urine protein orUPCweekl yfor2consecutive

5.4.6.2 QT Prolongation:
Guidelines for the management of prolonged QTinterval are as follows: 
Measure theQT i nterval (fromthestart oftheQwave totheendofthe
Twave) andtheprecedin g RR interval. Thecorrected QTinterval using 
the Bazett’s formula (QTcB interva l) will be calculated as the QT
interval (msec) divided by the square root of the RR in terval (msec).
OnlytheBazett’s formula should beused to calculate thecorrected QT
interval.
QTcB interval < 500 msec: No specific therap y needed.
Continue pazopanib at the same dose. Serum K+,Ca++, Mg++,andPhos 
should be monitored and repleted if low (see Section 5.4.4).
QTcB interval ≥ 500 msec: Hold pazopanib, review concom itant 
medications, andreplete serum K+, Ca++, Mg++,andPhos as needed.
TheEKGshould berepeated within 7daysandifthe QTcB interval 
is < 500 msec then resume pazopanib atareduced dose. IftheQTcB 
interval remains ≥ 500 msec, thepatient must be removed from
protocol t herapy.
5.4.7 Delays in Wound Healing:
Patients treated with VEG Fblockin gagents appear tohave anincreased riskof 
wound healing complications. Therefore, if patients require elective major surgery
onstudy ,pazopani bshould beheld for14daysprior tosurger yandfor 14days
after surgery (see Section 3.3.7 ).Pazopani bshould not be restarted if there is
evidence ofwoun dhealing complications such as awoun d infection. Patients who 
require surger y less than 14 days from treatment with pazopanib should be 
monitored closel y for woun d complications. Patients who require major surgery 
during Cycle 1 of therapy must be removed from protocol therapy.

(VotrientTM, GW786034 , Pazopanib HCl, GW786034 B (monohydrochloride salt)) 
NSC # 737754 ,IND# 065747
Source and Pharmacology :
The chemical name for pazopani b is 5-[[4-[(2,3 -Dimethyl-2H- indazo l-6-
yl)methylamino ]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino] -2-methylbenze nesulfonamide 
monohydrochloride. Themolecular formula isC21H23N7O2S-HCl. Themolecular
weight is474.0 (monohydrochlorid esalt)and437.5(freebase) .Themonohydrochlorid e
salt isvery slightl ysolubl e in0.1 M HCl(0.65mg/mL) ,practicall yinsolubl e in pH 7.0
phosphat ebuffer (0.0000 5mg/mL) ,andpracticall yinsolubl e in pH 11 piperidin ebuffe r
(0.000 2mg/mL).
Pazopani b is a multi-targete dinhibito r of vascula r endothelia lgrowt h facto r(VEGF) 
recepto r tyrosin ekinase s (VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 ,andVEGFR3) , platele t-derived growth 
factor receptor kinases (PDGF R-α and–β),fibroblast growth factor recepto r-1 and -3, 
cytokine receptor (Kit), interleukin -2receptor inducible T-cellkinase (Itk),leukocyt e-
specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor 
tyrosine kinase (c-Fms). In vitro, pazopanib inhibited ligand- induced
autophosphoryla tionof VEGF R-2, KitandPDGF R-β receptors. Invivo,pazopanib 
inhibited VEGF -induced VEGF R-2phosphorylation inmous elungs, angiogenesis in a
mous emodel, and the growth of some human tumor xenografts in mice.
Inadults, pazopanib isorally absorbed with median time to peak concentration of 2
to4 hours after thedose. Also in adults, theadministration ofasingle, crushed
pazopanib 400 mg tablet increased AUC(0-72) by46%, increased Cmax by
approximately 2fold, and decreased Tmaxbyapproximately 2hourscompared to
administration ofthe whole tablet. Due tothis potentia lfor increased exposure
(increased bioavailability, increased rateofabsorption), tablets ofpazopanib should
not becrushed. Systemi cexposure is increased when pazopanib is adminis tered with
food. Administration with ahigh-fator low-fatmeal results inanapproximately 2-fold
increase inAUCandCmax .Therefore, pazopanib shoul d be administered at least 1 
hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Pazopanib ismorethan 99% bound tohuman
plasm aprotein invivo. Invitro studies suggest thatpazopani bisa substrate forP-
glycoprotein (Pgp) andbreas tcancer resistant protein (BCRP).
Invitro studie sdemonstrated thatpazopanib ismetabolized byCYP3A 4with aminor 
contribution fromCYP 1A2 andCYP2C8 . Invitrodata alsoindicat e thatpazopani b is
an inhibito rforCYP1A2 ,CYP2B6 ,CYP2C8 ,CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 ,CYP2D6 ,CYP2E1 ,

and CYP3A 4withitsmostpoten tinhibitio n forthe isoenzym eCYP2C9 . In vivo,
however, pazopanib isaweakinhibito r ofCYP3A4 ,CYP2C8, andCYP2D 6 with no
effect on probes forCYP2C19, CYP2C9 ,andCYP1A 2. Therefore ,medication sthat

it is a t thediscretio n of theclinicia nbased on thepharmacokineti cpropertie s ofeach
individua lagent .Concomitant useofpazopanib with agents with narrow therapeutic 
windows that aremetabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C8, orCYP2D6 isnot
recommended. Coadministration may result ininhibition of the metabolism of these 
products and create the potential for serious adverse events.
Inadults, pazopanib hasameanhalf-life of 30.9 hours after administration ofthe 
recommended dose of800 mg.Elimination isprimaril yviafeces with renal
elimination accounting for <4% of the administered dose. Based on baseline hepat ic
function, 800mg pazopanib is recom mended for adult patients with mild impairment 
(defined as either normal bilirubin andanydegree ofalanine aminotransfe rase [ALT]
elevation orasan elevation ofbilirubi n up to 1.5x uppe rlimit ofnorma l[ULN]
regar dlessoftheALT value), and200 mg foradult patients with moderate impairmen t
(defined asanelevation ofbilirubin >1.5 to3xUL Nregardless of theALTvalues) . The
maximu mdose of pazopanib (200 mg) administered to adult patients with severe 
hepatic impairment didnot achieve therapeutic plasm aconcentrations. Therefore,
pazopanib isnotrecommended in adult patient swith sever ehepati cimpairment 
(defined as total bilirubi n>3xULN regardless of any level of ALT).
Pazopanib maycause prolongation oftheQT i nterval andtorsades depointes .Refer
toAppendix I IIBfor agents to avoid during administration of pazopanib.

Pregnancy Category D
Pazopanib cancausefetal harmwhen administered to apregnan twoman .Based on its 
mecha nism of action, pazopanib is expected toresult inadverse reproductive effects.
In pre-clinical studies in rats and rabbits, pazopanib was teratogenic, embryotoxic, 
fetotoxic, andabortifacient. Inpre-clinical studies inratsandrabbits, pazopanib was
teratogenic, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, andabortifacient. Administration ofpazopani b
topregnant rats during organogenesis at a dose level of ≥ 3 mg/kg/day
(approximately 0.1 timesthe huma nclinical exposure based onAUC )resulted in
teratogenic effects including cardiovascular malformations (retroesophageal 
subclavian artery , missing innominate artery, changes in the aortic arch) and 
incomplet e or absent ossification. In addition, there wasreduced fetal bodyweight, and
pre-andpost-implantation embryoleth ality inrats administered pazopanib atdoses ≥
3 mg/kg/day . In rabbits, maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption, increased
post-implantation loss, andabortion) wasobserved at doses ≥30 mg/kg/da y
(approximately 0.007 times the huma nclinical exposu re).Inaddition, severe 
materna l body weight loss and 100% litter loss were observed at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/da y 
(0.02 times the huma n clinical exposure), while fetal weigh t was reduced at doses ≥3 
mg/kg/day (AUC not calculated).
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies ofpazopanib inpregnant wome n. 
Protocol therapy should beimmediately discontinued if pregnancy occurs while the 
patient is on therapy . Wome n of childbearing potential should beadvised to avoid 
becomin g pregnant while taking pazopa nib and for up to 30 days after stopping 
pazopanib.

7.2 Monitoring for Specific Toxicities
7.2.1 Growth Plate Toxicity
Patients willhave a plain AP radiograph of a single proximal tibial growth
plate obtained prior to the first dose of protocol therapy.
a.If patients are found to have a closed tibial growth plate, no further 
radiographs will be required.
b.Ifpatients arefound to have an open tibial growth plate, then repeat plain 
AP radiographs ofthesametibial growth plate will be obtained prior to
starting Cycle 2, Cycle 5 and then every 6 months (prior to cycle 11, 17, 
etc).
Patients with evidence of growth plate thicke ning or other changes 
should have a knee MRI performed to further assess the degree of
physeal patholog yandundergo morefrequent x-rayfollow up.MRI
should beperforme dwithout contrast. If no MRIchanges areseen,
x-rays may be performed approximately every 2 months.
Patients with knee MRIchanges should bemanage d inanindividualized
manner. Decisions regarding continuation ofpazopani bshould takeinto 
account thepresence ofanysymptoms referable totheknee aswell
asthe patient’s response topazopanib. Consultation with an orthopedic
surgeon mayalsobeindicated. Plans for follo w-up imagin gwillalsobe 
made on anindividualized basis, taking into account thepresenc eof 
symptom s attheknee or other jo intsaswell asthedecision tocontinue 
pazopanib or not. Consultation with orthopedics and with the Study 
Chair is advised.
7.2.2 Thyroid Toxicity
Patients will have a TSH level measured prior to initial treatment, prior to 
starting Cycle 3, 5, andthen every3rdcycle thereafter (eg:prior toCycle
8,Cycle 11,etc).Patients found to have anabnormal TSHlevel should have
afreeT4level measured. Thyroid toxicity willbehandled like anyother non-
hematological toxicity. Guidance onthemanagement of patients who develop 
hypothyroidism is included in Section 4.1.5.2.
7.2.3 Cardiac Toxicity
Patients will have abaseline echocardiogram andEKGobtained pre-treatment, 
prior toCycle s 2and 5,andthen every 6months (prior toCycle 11, 17, etc)
andasclinicall yindicated. See Section 5.4.6 formanagement ofchanges
inleft ventricular function and prolonged QT cBwhile on protocol therapy.
7.2.4 Pregnancy Testing and Reporting
Theneed forascreening pregnancy testdepend s on whether afemale patien t
is ofchildbearin gpotential or non- childbearing potential. If afemale patient is
of childbearing potential, she must have aserum -Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (-HCG )pregnanc ytestperforme dwithin 7 days prior tothe
firstdose ofstudy treatment(s). Patient swith a positive pregnancy test result 
must be excluded from thestudy .Patients witha negative pregnanc ytestresult
mustagree tousean adequate contraception metho d asdescribed below durin g
thestudyuntil 2 weeks following thelastdose of study treatment(s). Any
pregnanc ythatoccurs during study participation must be reported using a
clinica ltrial pregnanc yform. Toensure patient safety, each pregnancy must 
Novartis Confidential Page 70
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Study 
treatment should be immediately discontinued if pregnancy occurs durin g
studyparticipation. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome 
(including premature terminatio n) and status of mother and child. Pregnanc y
complications and electiv eterminations for medical reasons must be 
reported as an AE or SAE (Section 11.8). Spontaneous abortions must be 
reported as an SAE.
AnySAEoccurring in association with apregnanc ybrought tothe
investigator’s attention after the patien thas completed the studyand
considered bythe investigator as possibl y related to the study treatment(s) must 
be promptly reported to Novartis.
Any SAEoccurring asaresult of apost-study pregnancy which isconsidered 
reasonably related tothestudytreatment bytheinvestigator, willbereported 
to theSponsor. While the investigator isnot obligated toactively seek this 
information informe rstudyparticipants, heorshemaylearn of an SAE
through spontaneous reporting.
Inaddition, theinvestigator mustattempt tocollec tpregnancy information
on anyfemale partners ofmale studysubjects who becom epregnant while
the subject is enrolled inthe study . Pregnancy information must be reported to
Novartis as described above.
7.3 Pharmacokinetic studies
7.3.1 Description of Studies and Assay
Plasma samples will be collected and analyze dforpazopanib levels usinga 
validated LC/MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography/Tande m Mass Spectrometry) 
method under the control of Novartis.
7.3.2 Sampling schedule:
All patients (whether receivin gpazopanib astable t or asoralpowder 
suspension) will have ablood sampl eforanalysis oftheplasm apazopanib
concentration collecte d prior to the first dose on Day 1 of C ycle 1. In addition, 
all patients will have 2blood samplescollected on D ay15 ± 1 day of Cycle
1: one sampl eprior to the doseandonesample 3-4 hours after dosing.
Blood samples for analysis of steady -state troug h plasma pazopanib 
concentrations willalsobeobtained prior to the start ofeverysubsequent odd-
numbered cycle (that is,pre-dose prior toCycle 3,pre-dose prior to Cycle 5, 
etc). These stead y-state trough plasma concentration samples can be collected 
between Day 22 of theprevious cycle toDay 1 of theodd-num bered cycle,
and the actual date and time of sample collection recorded on the PK sample 
collection form .NoPK sample s are required beyond Cycle 11.
The pre-dose sample onDay 15 ± 1 dayofCycle 1andthetrough plasma 
concentration samples taken prior todosing forevery odd-numbered cycle 
should be obtained between 22-26 hours after the previous dose of 
pazopanib. Patients shoul d be instructed tohold their dose ofpazopanib on
thedaythat a pre-dose PKsample isto be collected. Collection of thesePK
samples should correspond to the timing of routine laboratory evaluations.
Novartis Confidential Page 71
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
Extended PKsampling will bedone durin gCycle 1 in thefirst patients who 
receive thepowde rsuspension formulation, until 6patients areconsidered 
evaluable for the PK analysis. These patients will have a blood sampl e for 
analysis oftheplasm apazopanib concentration collected atthefollowing
time points onDay 1 of Cycle 1:pre-dose andat30min, 1hour, 2 hou rs,4
hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours after thedose. Samples will also beobtained on
Day 15 ± 1 day of Cycle 1: pre -dose and at 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours,
6hours, and 8 hours after thedose. If one or moreofthese 6patients fail to
provide blood samples asspecified intheprotocol or if it isknow nthatfor 
somereason a patient’s collected blood sample(s) cannot be analyzed, that 
patient(s) will be deter mined to be non- evaluable for this analysis andone or
moreadditional patients will be enrolled fortreatment with pazopanib as
powde rfororal suspension andprovision oftheextended PKsamples. These
patients will also provide bloodsamples foranalysis ofstead y-state trough
plasm apazopanib concentrations prior tothestart ofevery subsequent odd-
numbered cycle as described in the preceding paragrap h.
Pazopanib dosin g ofeithe r tablet or powde rsuspension must have continued 
uninterrupted and at the samedose level foratleast 10days prior to
acquisition of theCycle 1Day 15 P K samples. Ifpazopanib dosin ghasbeen
interrupted or modified <10 days prior toCycle 1Day15,then thePKsamples
should betaken between Cycle 1Day 15andCycle 1Day 22 on a study day
thatmeets the condition ofatleast 10consecutive days ofdosin g atthesame
dose level. The Cycle 1Day 15PKkitshould beused andtheactual date and 
time ofsample collections should berecorded in the eCRF.
If ≥2 out of 6evalu ablepatients havedose-limiting toxicities as define d in 
Section 5.1)during the first cycle, then enrollment at the 225 mg/m2/dose dose 
level ofpazopanib oral suspension will behalted. Subsequent new patien ts
will beenrolled atthe160mg/m2/dose level until 6evaluable patients from this
dose group areavailable forthesafety review and6patients areavailable for
PK analysis.
7.3.3 Sample Collection and Handling Instructions:
Blood samples (2 m L for each samp le) will be collected for PK into tubes 
containing potassiu m EDTA as an anticoagulant. See the corresponding
Pharmacokinetic Study Form (Appendix VI) for specific details of Sample 
Collection, Processing, Handling, and Shipping.

8.3 Criteria for Withdrawal from Study
Patients will be withdrawn from the study if any of thefollowing
occur:
 Death
 Lost tofollow-up
 Withdrawa l ofconsent
 Thestudy isclose d/terminated
 Investigato rdiscretion
9STATISTICAL CONSIDE RATIONS
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration
9.1.1 Review ofpatient accrual onto recent Phase IIsolid tumo rstudies indicates the 
following entry rates for the various tumors under study can be expected:
Disease Group /Cohort s Patients/Year
Osteosarcoma 24
Ewing sarcoma 18
Rhabdomyosarcoma 18
Neuroblastoma (measurable disease) 12
Neuroblastoma (evaluable disease) 12
Non-rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas 10 
(including synovial sarcoma, alveolar soft part 
sarcoma)
Hepatoblastoma 7
With these entry rates, theprobability ofaccruin g 10 patients tocomplete
the initial stage ofevaluation intheseven name dcategories within 24
month sis88%. Thecorresponding probability forenrollin g 20 patients inthe
seven named disease categories in 48 months is95%. The study will likely
require 2 to 3.5years for sufficient patient enr ollments to evaluate pazopanib in 
the stated disease groups. A minimu m of 77 patients and a maximu m of 154 
patients are anticipated, after accountin gforhistorica lrates ofpatient 
inevaluability for the primary endpoint in phase II studies.

against the alternative hypothesis P=0.25).
9.3 Analysis Populations
The modified Inten t-to-Treat (mITT) population is theprimar yanalysis population. The 
mITTwill consist of all patients who have received at least one dose of protocol therap y.
The Safety population will comprise allpatien ts in themITT population. The safety  
population will be used for the analysis of safety data.
The Per Protocol (PP) population is a subset of the mITT population who meet all eligibility 
criteria .
ThePharmacokinetic (PK) population willcomprise allpatients inthemITT population
for whom a pharmacokinetic sample is obtained and analyzed. The Pharmacokinetic 
Extended Samplin g(PKES) population will comprise all subjects in the Pharmacokinetic 
population who received powder suspension and hav e atleast one non-predose sample 
collected and analyzed using the extended sampling schedule in Section 7.3.2. PK analysis 
summaries, figures and listings will be based on PKand PKES population s.
9.4 Analysis Data Sets
Theprimar ydata setfor assessing efficacy willcomprise themITT population. The PP and 
mITT population swill be used for objective response analysis. All other efficacy analyses 
will be based on mITT only.
The primar ydata set for assessing safetywill comprise thesafety population define din
Section 9.3 (Analysis Populations ).

9.5 Treatment Comparisons
There will beno treatment comparisons asthere isonly one treatment arm.No comparisons 
across cohorts will be conducted.
9.6 Primary Analysi sandEnd ofStudy Analysis
Noformal interi manalysis isplanned outside ofthe study design. Thestudyteamwill review 
safety data periodically over the course of the study.
Expansion oftumor specifi c cohorts will be donewhenthere is atleast one investigator
determined confirme dresponse inthat cohort withinthe firs t 10 enrolled patients .A 
given tumor specific cohort will not be expanded if all the patients in the cohort hav e:
Progressed
Discontinued therapy
Withdrawn consent
Been determined to be lost -to-follo w-up
Orhave been treated for at least 20 w eekswithout aresponse, makin g
it unlikely that a response will occur.
Theprimaryanalysis will beperforme d 20 week safterthelastpatient’s firstvisit inthe 
three cohorts of primar y interest (rhabdomyosarcoma, non -rhabdomyosarcomatous soft 
tissue sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET).
Thestudywill becomplete d one year fromthedate ofthelastpatient’s firstvisit and 
the end of study analysis will be performed atthetime ofstudy completio n.
Anyadditional data collected after theprimaryanalysis will be included ina 
suppl ementary analysis and reported in a final Clinical Study Report.
9.7 Key Elements of Analysis Plan
9.7.1 Study Withdrawal
Allpatien tswho withdraw fromthestudy willbeincluded inanalyse suptothe 
time of withdrawal, regardless oftheduration oftreatment.
9.7.2 Missing Data
As the period of treatment for anypatient will be dependent ontreatment efficacy 
andtoxicity, theduration offollow-up will varybetween patien ts.Consequently,
there will benoimputatio nformissi ngdata. Where appropriate, available data 
will be summarized over specified intervals (e.g. from study entry until withdrawal
fromthestudy )using suitable summar ystatistics. Detail swillbe given in the 
Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP).
For the second ary PFS endpoint, the date associated with the last adequate disease
assessment will beused forthose patien tswhoarealive andhave notprogressed
atthetime of analysis; such patien tswillbeconsidered censored in the analysis.
9.7.3 Other Issues
Data from all participatin g centers will be poole d prior to analysis. It is anticipated 
that patient accrual will be spread thinly across centers andsummaries ofdata by
center would beunlikel y to be informative andwill not, therefore, be provided.
Demograph icandbaseline characteristics willbesummarized.
Novartis Confidential Page 76
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
Two- sided 90% confidence limits willbeused intheestimation ofresponse rates 
and viewed as descriptive.
Anydeviations from ,oradditions to, the original analysis plan described inthis 
protocol wi ll be documented in the RAP and final study report.
9.8 Methods ofAnalysis
9.8.1 Primary Endpoint: Objective Response Rate (ORR)
This is defined as the percentage of patien ts achieving either a complete or partial 
tumor response as per response criteria. The response rate will be calculated from  
theinvestigator review. Confirmatio nwill bebased onthediseas eassessment 
performed 1cycle after theinitial response. Theobjectiv eresponse ratewill be 
computed for the 3 tumor types of primary interest.
Patients in the mITT population withunknown ormissing response will be treated
asnon-responders (i.e.,they will be include d inthedenominator when calculating 
the percentag e).
In other words, ORR = (number of patien ts with a confirmed best overall response 
of CR +number of patien tswith a confirmed best overall response of PR) divided 
by the total number of patien ts in the cohor t.
The assessment ofactivit y of treatment within each histolog ycohort will be 
based on the decision rule outlined in Section 9.2.
90% confidence intervals will be provided tocharacterize thevariab ilityaround 
the response rate. The data will be presented for each cohor t.
9.8.2 Secondary Endpoints:
9.8.2.1 The objective response ratewill becomputed forthe4tumortypes of 
secondary interest. The analysis method will be the same as thatdescribed 
in Section 9.8.1.
9.8.2.2 If recruitment is stopped in the non-primary histology group(s) andithas 
lessthan 10 patien ts,theresponse datawill display summar ystatistics 
and the rule in the table under Section 9.2 will not apply.
9.8.2.3 Progression -free survival (PFS) andoverall survival (OS)
Theanalysis willevaluate the mITT population onPFSusing data from 
the investi gator review. PFS is defined as the interval between the date 
of first dose ofprotocol therapy and theearliest date of disease
progression ordeath due to anycause. Patients areconsidered tohave
progressive disease if they have documented progression based on
radiologic assessment as determined byinvestigator review (defined in
Sectio n10). Forpatien ts who do no t progres s or die, progression -free 
survival will be censored at thedate oflastadequate assessment ordate
oflastadequate assessment prior toinitiatio n of new ant i-cancer
therap y if applicable. PFS will be summarize d using aKaplan -Meier
Novartis Confidential Page 77
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
survival curve. The Kaplan -Meier estimate for the median progression -
free survival time and thefirstandthird quartiles willbepresented, along 
with anaive approximate 90% confidence interval ifthere areasufficient
number of progressi ons or deaths.
Overall survival isdefine dasthetimefromthefirstdose ofthestudy 
medication until death due to anycause. The OS analysis willbe 
performed on themITTpopulation andsummarize dusing aKaplan -
Meier survival curve. The Kaplan -Meier estimate forthemedian OS 
time and the first and third quartiles will be presented, along with a naive 
approximate 90% confidence interval ifthere areasufficient number of 
deaths.
Details on how event andcensoring timesareassigne d to a patient will 
be provided in theRAP.
9.8.2.4 Duration of response (DoR)
For the subset of patient s with a confirmed CR/PR, D oR isdefined as the 
time from first documented evidence of complete or partial response to 
theearliest dateofdisease progression ordeath due to anycause. For 
confirmed responders who have not experienced progression or death 
prior to the date of data cut-off for analysis or starting other anticancer 
therapy, duration of response will be right -censored on the date of their 
last adequate post -baseline tumor assessment prior to the cut -off or start 
of other anticancer therapy.
Duration of response will be summariz ed descriptively for each cohort 
using medians and quartiles if there are 5 or more responders (confirmed 
CR/PR) in one cohort, otherwise, only a listing with subject level details 
will be provided. 
9.8.2.5 Clinical Benefit
This isdefined asthepercentage ofpatien tsachievin geither a complete 
orpartial tumor respo nse or stable disease forat least two protocol 
scheduled disease assessments asperRECIS Tcriteria. 90% confidence 
intervals willbeproduced tocharacterize thevariabilit yaroun d thepoint 
estimate.
Time to Progression (TTP)
Theanalysis willevaluate themITT population on TTP usingdata from 
theinvestigator review. TTP isdefined astheinterva lbetween thedate 
of first dose of protocol therapy and the earliest date of disease
progression ordeath duetodisease under study .Patients areconsidered 
tohave progressive disease ifthey have documented progression based
onradiologic assessment asdetermined byinvestigator revie w(defined 
inSection 10). TTP willbesummarized using a Kaplan -Meier survival 
curve. The Kaplan -Meier estimate forthemedia ntime to progression 
andthefirstandthird quartiles will be presented, along with anaive 
approximate 90% confidence interval ifthere areasufficient number of 
events.
Details on how event andcensoring timesare assign edto apatient will

be provided in the RAP.
9.8.2.6 Safety Measures:
Safety data will bepresen ted for all patien ts in the safety population 
(mITT) regardless of cohor t. If there aremultiple dose levels for the 
powder suspension formulation group,then data foreach dose level will 
be presented in separate columns.
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Hematology ,coagulation parameters, clinical chemistry, lipase and 
amylase, thyroid function tests, andUPCdata will besummarized at 
each scheduled assessment. Hematology ,coagulation parameters and 
clinical chemistry willbesummarized byNCI-CTCAE version 4.0and 
by data outside the reference range for each scheduled assessment.
Other Safety Measures
Vital signs(blood pressure, heart rate, temperature ),height andweight 
willbe listed for each patien tandchang efrombaseline willbeincluded 
for blood pressure and heart rate. A descriptive summar y including 
change frombaseline pre-dose willalso be presented. Individual profiles 
of blood pressure will be plo ttedbytime.
The corrected QTcBinterval (QTc B)willbelisted for each patien tand 
summarized ateach scheduled assessment time. Change from baseline 
will be summarized and an analysis of central tendency (means, medians)
willbepresented. A categorical analysis foreach QTcB parameter will
beperforme d todetermine thenumbe r ofpatien ts at each time point for 
the following categories:
QTcB. <450, 450 to <480, 480 to 500, and >500 msec.
QTcB change from baseline, 30 to <60 msec, and ≥ 60 msec.
9.9 Evaluability for Response
Response will be determined on the m odified intent to treat (mITT) population consisting  
of all patients who are eligible and received at least one dose of protocol therap y.
Forhepatoblastoma patients, RECIST criteria asdescri bedbelow willbeused to provide 
anevaluation ofRECIS T-based response. For patients without serumalpha fetoprotein 
(AFP) elevated beyond theinstitutional upper limit of normal forage atthe time ofthe start
ofprotocol therapy ,theRECIS T-based respo nse will determine therespons eforthe 
application ofthestatistical rule described inSection 9.Patients whose serumAFP level 
iselevated beyond theinstitutional upper level ofnorma lforage atthestart of protocol 
therapy wil l also beassessed forAFP-based response. Anysuch patient considered 
evaluable for response as described in Sectio n 9.8 will be considered: (1) an AFP complete
responder (AFP -CR) ifanyserumAFPobtain ed on or after thestart ofCycle 3 but before
thestart ofCycle 7 is considered at or belowtheinstitutional upper limit of normal for 
age; or (2) an AFP partial responder (AFP -PR) if any serum AFP obtained on or after the 
start of Cycle 3 but before the start of Cycle 7 is50% or lessthan that individual’s initial 
AFP but is still considered abov e the institutional upper level of normal age; and (3) AFP -
non-responder in any other case. The initial AFP obtained onDay 1 of protocol therapy or
Novartis Confidential Page 79
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
theAFPobtained during enrollmen t(seeNote in Section 3.1.7.1), if the Day 1 AFP is not 
available.
For patients evaluable for both RECIS T-based andAFP-based response, theoverall 
response forapplication of thestatistical rule will becalculated as: (1) RECIS T-CR or 
RECIS T-PR,AFP-anyresponse categor y –response; (2)RECIS T-SD,AFP-CR or AFP-
PR – r esponse; (3)Anyother combination ofRECIS TandAFP response –non-responder.

9.11 Analysis of the Pharmacokinetic Parameters
Plasma pazopanib concentrations observed inthefirst 6patien tswho receive pazopanib as
powder fororal suspension andare evaluable forpharmacokinetics will beanalyzed with
standard non compartmental method susingWinNon linversion 5.2 or higher. Parameter
values formaximu mplasma pazopanib concentration (Cmax), thetime to Cma x(tmax),
and thearea under thecurve (AUC) fromzero tothetime of thelast quantifiable 
concentration (AUC( 0-t)) will be calculated. The AUC from zero to 24 hours after
administration (AUC (0-24)) onDay 15 will be calculated byusing thepredose plasma
pazopanib concentration astheconcentration 24hours after dosing .Theanalysis toassess
pazopanib pharmacokinetics after administration ofthesuspension prior to continuing 
enrollment onsuspension may beperformed using scheduled time. Calculations of
noncompartmental parameter values forthefinal analysis will bebased on actual sampling
times.
Plasma pazopanib concentration values at each sampling occasion will be summarized by 
cohort as well as after combining the data from all cohorts, separately for each formulation
andeach dose level, ifneeded. Inaddition, plasm apazopanib concentration values at each
sampling occasion will besummarize d by agesubgroups (28days to <2 years, 2 to<12years
ofage,and12 to 18 years of age) foreach formula tion anddose level, ifneeded . This analysi s

The pharmacok inetic paramete rvalues inthepatients with extended samplin g will be 
summarized forCycle 1 Day 1andCycl e 1Day15,combining data fromall patients, 
separately by dose level, if needed.
9.12 Analysis of Biological and Correlative Endpoints
Thesecondar yanalyses forexamining thebiologic relationship between tumor response and
angiogenic cytokines aswell astheeffects ontoxicity (includin ghypertension) of 
pharmacokinetic parameter s (secondar yobjectives 1.2.7and 1.2.9)will be conducted 
 For the response outcome measure,
patients willbe classified asresponders ornon-responders according to paragraphs 2and3
ofthe Primary Endpoint (Sect ion 9.8.1 ) above. If response occurs in 10% or more of 
patients, the following logistic model will be fitted:

10 EVALUA TION CRITERIA
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria forAdverse Events (CTCAE)
Thisstudy will utiliz etheCTCA E of theNationa lCance rInstitut e(NCI )fortoxicit y
andperformance reporting. The descriptions andgradin gscales found intherevised 
CTCAE version 4.0willbeutilized forreporting . All appropriate treatment areas shoul d
have access to a copyoftheCTCA Eversion 4.0,which can be downloaded fromthe
CTEP web site(http://ctep.cancer.go v). Additionally, toxicities areto be reported on
the appropriate case report forms.
10.2 Response Criteria
Asoutlined ,patient swill beassigne d toone of the followin g categorie s for assessmen tof 
response : a)solidtumo randmeasurabl ediseas e (Sectio n10.3); b) neuroblast oma with 
MIBGpositiv elesion s(Sectio n10.4)c)hepatoblastom a(Sectio n10.6)
Note:Neuroblastom apatient swho do nothave MIBG positiv elesion s shoul d be assessed 
forrespons e assolidtumo rpatient swithmeasurabl edisease.
10.3 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors and Measurable Disease
Response andprogression will beevaluated inthisstudy usingtherevised Response 
Evaluation Criteria inSolidTumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1)[Eur J Ca 45:228 -
247, 2009].45 Key points arethat5target lesions areidentified andthatchange s inthe
largest diamete r(unidimensional measurement) ofthetumor lesions areused in
the RECIST v 1.1 criteri a.
10.3.1 Measurable Disease
The presence ofatleast one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension with thelonges tdiameter atleast 10 mm (CTscan slice
thickness nogreater than 5mm).Theinvestigator will identify up to 5
measurable lesions tobefollowed forresponse. Previous ly irradiated lesions
mustdemonstrate clear evidence of progression to be considered measurabl e.
Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with appropriate imaging 
modalities (e.g., CT or MRI).Bone scans cannot be used to measure lesions. The 
same method ofassessment is to be used tocharacterize each identified and 
reported lesion at baseline a nd during follo w-up.
10.3.2 Quantification of Disease Burden
The sum of the longes t diamete r (LD) for all targe t lesion s will be calculate d 
and reported as the disease measurement.
10.3.3 End-of-Cycle Response
Note: Please also see Table 1 in Section 10.7.
a. Complete Response (CR)
Disapp earance ofalltarge tand non-target lesions. Normalization of
urinary catecholamines (for patients with neuroblastoma), immunocytologic 
findings, or other tumor markers if abnormal or elevated at study enrollment.
Novartis Confidential Page 82
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
b. Partial Response (PR)
Atleast a 30% decrease inthedisease measurement, taking asreference
the disease measuremen t done to confir m measurable disease at study
enrollment. No new lesions orprogression ofanynon-target measurable 
lesion.
c. Stable Disease
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest disease measurement since
the treatment started.
d. Progressive Disease (PD)
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the disease measurements for 
measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest disease
measurement recorded since thestart oftreatment, ortheappearance of
one or morenew lesions.
10.3.4 Overall Best Assessment Response
Each patient willbeclassified according totheir “best response” forthepurposes 
ofanalysis oftreatment effect. Best response isdetermined fromthesequence
ofthe objective statuses descri bed in Table 1 and 2 inSection 10.7.
10.4 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with 123I -MIBG Positive Lesions
10.4.1 MIBG Positive Lesions
Patients who have apositive MIBGscan atthestart of therapy will beevaluable 
forMIBGresponse. Theuse of123I forMIBGimagin g isrecommended forall 
scans. Ifthepatient has only oneMIBGpositive lesion andthat lesion was 
irradiated, abiops ymust be done atleast 4weeks after radiation wascompleted 
and must show viable neuroblast oma.
10.4.2 The following criteria will be used toreport MIBGresponse bythetreating 
institution:
Complete Response: Complete resolution of all MIBG positive 
lesions
Partial Response :Resolutio n of at least one MIBGpositive
lesion, with persistence of ot her MIBG positive lesions.
Stable Disease: No chang e in MI BG scan innumber of
positive lesions (includes patients who havesamenumber of
positive lesions but decreased density).
Progressive Disease: Development ofnewMIBG positive lesions.
10.4.3 Theresponse ofMIBGlesions willbeassesse dusingtheCurie scale asoutlined 
below.
The body is divided into 9anatomic sectors forosteomedullar ylesions, with
a 10thgeneral sector allocate dforanyextra -osseous lesion visible onMIBG
scan. In each region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension 
score is graded as:
0 = no site per segment,
1 = 1 site per segment,
2= more than one site per segment,
Novartis Confidential Page 83
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).
The absolute score isobtaine d by addin gthescore of allthesegments.
See diagram of sectors below:
Therelative scoreis calculated bydividin gthe absolute score ateach time point 
bythecorresponding pre-treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient iscalculated ateach response assessment compared tobaseline and 
classified as below:
1. Complete response: allareas ofuptake onMIBGscan completely resolved.
If morphological evidence of tumo r cells in bone marrow biops y or aspiration is
present atenrollment, thepatient will bedetermined tohave a
complete response when notumo rcellscan bedetecte d by routin emorphology

least 3week sapart.
2. Partial respons e:Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almos tdisappeared) to ≤ 0.5
(lesions strongly reduced).
3. Stable diseas e: Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakl y but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).
4. Progressive diseas e: New lesions on MIBG scan
10.4.4 Overall Best Response Assessment
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the 
purposes of analysis oftreatment effect. Best response isdetermined fromthe
sequence ofthe objective statutes described in Table 3 inSection 10.7.
10.5 Response Criteria for the Bone Marrow in Neuroblastoma Patients
10.5.1 Bone Marrow Response
Bone Marrow response is determined byH&E staining ofbilateral bone marrow 
biopsies and aspirates.
 Complete Response : No tumo rcellsdetectab le by routine morpholog y
on2 consecutive bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed at 
least 3 weeks apart.
 Progressive Diseas e:

Novartis Confidential Page 84
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
oPatients who enroll with neuroblastoma in the bone marrow by 
morphology have progressive disease ifthere isadoubling in the 
amount of tum or in the m arrow AND have a minimum of 25% tum or 
in the bone marrow bymorphology .(For example, apatient enterin g
with 5%tumor inthebone marrow bymorpholog ymustincrease to
≥25%tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 30% 
tumo r must increase to >60%).
oPatients who enroll withou t evidenc e of neuroblastom a in the bone 
marrow will bedefine d as progressive disease iftumor is detected
in2 consecutive bonemarrow biopsies oraspirations done atleast 3 
weeks apart.
 Stable Disease :Persistence of tumor inbonemarrow that does notmeet
the criteria for either complete response or progressive disease.
10.5.2 The above Bone marrow response criteria willbeutilized forNeuroblastoma
patients when determining the Overall Best Response in Section 10.7.
10.6 Response Criteria for Hepatoblastoma
10.6.1 Forhepatoblastoma patients, RECIST criteria asdescribed abov e will beused
to provide anevaluation ofRECIS T-based response. Forpatients without serum  
alpha fetoprotein (AFP )elevated beyond theinstitutional upper limit of
normal forageatthe time ofthestart ofprotocol therapy, theRECIS T-based
response will determine therespons efortheapplication of the statistical rule
described in Section 9.Patients whos eserum AFPelevated beyon dthe
institutional upper level ofnorma latthestart ofprotocol therapy will also be 
assessed forAFP-based response. Anysuch patient considered evaluable for
response asdescribed in Section 9.4abov ewill beconsidered: (1)anAFP
complete responder (AFP -CR) ifanyserumAFPobtained onorafter the
start ofCycle 3 but before the start ofCycle 7isconsidered atorbelowthe
institutional upper limit ofnormal forage; or(2) an AFPpartial responde r
(AFP- PR)if any serum AFPobtained on or after the start of Cycle 3 but before 
the start of Cycle 7 is 50% or less than that individua l’sinitial AFPbutisstill
considered abov etheinstitutional upper level ofnormal forage; and(3)AFP-
non-responder in anyother case. Theinitia lAFP istheAFPobtaine donDay
1 of protocol therapy ortheAFPobtained during enrollment, if the Day 1 
AFP is not available.
Forpatients evaluable forboth RECIS T-based andAFP-based response, the 
overall response for application of the statistical rule will be calculated as: (1)
RECIS T-CR or RECIS T-PR, AFP-any response categor y –respon se; (2) 
RECIS T-SD,AFP-CR or AFP-PR – Response; (3)Anyother combination of 
RECIST and AFP response – non- responder.
10.6.2 Measurement ofserum AFP markers
The serumAFPshoul d be collected immediately prior tostartin gtherap y on
the first dayoftreatment, and again at each scheduled disease evaluation if the 
initial value iselevated. Thevalue must bereported as aprecise number , and

Theoverall response assessmen t forhepatoblastoma patients takes intoaccount 
response inthemeasurable andnon-measurable disease, andtheappearance
ofnew lesions, where applicable, anddeclin e ofAFPaccording tothe criteria 
described in Table 4 below.
10.7 Best R espo nse(Solid Tumors)
Two objective status deter minations of disease statu s, by CTorMRI, obtained ontwo 
consecutive determ inations, separated byatleast a 3week time period, arerequired
to deter minethepatient’s overallbest response. Two objective status deter minations of
CR before progr ession arerequired forbest response ofCR.Two deter minations ofPR
or better before progression, butnotquali fying foraCR,arerequired forabestresponse 
of PR.Two determinations ofstable/no response orbetter before progression, butnot

11 ADV ERSE EVE NT(AE)AND SERIOUS A DVERSE EVEN TS(SAE)
The investigator orsitestaff isresponsible fordetecting, documenting andreporting even ts
that meet thedefinition ofanAE or SAE.
AEs will becollected fromthestartofprotocol therapy and until 28 days following last 
dose ofprotocoltherapy.
SAEs willbecollected overthesametimeperiod as stated above forAEs.From the time 
a patient consents to participate in and completes the study, allSAEs assessed asrelated 
tostudyparticipation (e.g., study treatment, protoco l-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or 
change in existing therapy)  will be reported promptly to Novartis as indicated in Section 
11.8.
Medical occurrences that beginprior tothestart ofprotocol therapy butafter obtaining 
informed consent shoul d be recorded on theMedical History/Current Medical Conditions 
section oftheeCRF.
Anynew primary cance rmust berecorde d as an SAEand will be recorde dfromthetime a
patient consents to participate in the study up to and including any follo w-up contac t.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Novartis andCOG w ithin 24 hours, as indicated 
in Section 11.8.
Investigators arenotobligated toactively seek AEs orSAEs informer study participants.
However, ifthe investigator learns ofanySAE, including adeath, atanytime after a patient
hasbeendischarged fromthestudy ,andhe/she considers the eventreasonably related tothe
studytreatment orstudyparticipation, theinvestigator should promptly notify Novartis and
COG .
11.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is anyuntoward medical occurrence in a patient orclinical investigation patien t, 
temporally associated with the useof amedicinal product, whether or notconsidered related
tothemedicinal product. CTCAEcriteria version 4.0will be used tograde severity 
of adverse events.
Note: An AE cantherefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding) ,symptom , ordiseas e(new orexacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product
Events meeting the definition of an AE includ e:
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinalysis)
orother safetyassessments (e.g.,ECGs, radiol ogical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worse n from baseline, and felt to beclinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
Newconditions detected ordiagnosed after studytreatment administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, symptoms , ortheclinical sequelae of a suspected overdose ofeither study 
treatment or aconc omitan tmedication. (Overdose persewillnot be reported as an
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possibl esuicidal/sel f-
harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae .)
"Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharm acological action" persewillnot be
reported as anAE orSAE. However, thesigns and symptom s and/or clinical sequelae 
resultin g from lack of efficacy will be reported if they  fulfil the definition of an AE 
or SAE.
Novartis Confidential Page 89
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
Events that donotmeet the definition ofanAEinclude:
 Anyclinically significant abnormal laboratory findings orother abnormal safety 
assessments thatareassociated with theunderlying disease, unless judged bythe 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the patien t’s condition.
 Thedisease/disorder beingstudied, orexpected progression, signs, orsymptoms of
thedisease/disorder beingstudied, unless moresevere than expected forthe patien t’s 
condition.
 Medical orsurgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy ,appendectomy); the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE.
 Situations wher eanuntoward medical occurrence didnotoccur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
 Anticipated da y-to-da y fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
11.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
Refer toSection 11.8 forreporting requirements including thewithin 24hour timelimit 
for all SAEs as defined below.
If aneventisnotanAEperSection 11.1 then itcannot be an SAEeven ifserious conditions
aremet(e.g.,hospitalization forsigns/symptom s of thedisease under study, death due to 
progression of disease, etc) .
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
 Results in death
 Is life -threatening
NOTE: The term 'life-threatening' inthedefinition of'serious' refers to an ev ent in 
which thepatient wasatrisk ofdeath atthetime of the event . It does not refer t oan
event, which hypothetically migh thave caused death, if it were more severe.
 Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
NOTE: Ingeneral, hospitalization signifies that the patient hasbeen detained 
(usually involving atleast anovernig htstay) at thehospital oremergency department 
for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the
physician’s office or out- patient setting. Complications that occur during
hospitalization areAEs. If a complication prolongs hosp italization orfulfills any
other seriou scriteria, the event isserious. When indoubt asto whether 
“hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospitalization forelectiv etreatment ofa pre -existing condition that didnot worsen 
from ba seline is not considered an AE.
 Results in disability/incapacity
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct norma llife functions. This definition is notintended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting , diarrhea, influenza, or accidental traum a (e.g.sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruptio n.
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Medical orscientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is
appropriate inother situations, such asimportant medical events that maynot be
immediately life-threatening orresult indeath orhospitalization butmay jeopardize
Novartis Confidential Page 90
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
thepatient ormayrequire medical orsurgical intervention toprevent one of theother
outcomes listed intheabov edefinition. These should alsobe considered serious.
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant c ancers, intensive treatment inan
emergenc y room or at home forallergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or
convulsions thatdonot result inhospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
 All events of possible dru g-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as 
ALT >3xUL Nandbilirubi n > 1. 5x ULN (>35% of total bilirubin is direct) or ALT
>3xUL N andINR>1.5, ifINRmeasured termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR 
measurement isnot required andthethreshold valuestated willnotapply to patien ts 
receiving anticoagulants).
NOTE: Bilirubin fractionation isperformed iftestin g is available. If testing is 
unavailable, record presenc eof detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating 
direct bilirubi nelevations and suggesting liver injury . If testing isunavailable 
and apatient meets the criterion oftotal bilirubin 2xULN, then theevent isstill 
reported asanSAE. IfINR isobtained, include values ontheSAEform . INR 
elevations >1.5 suggest severe liver injur y.
11.3 Method of Dete cting AEs andSAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias whendetectin gAEs and/or SAEs .Open-ended 
andnon-leading verbal questioning ofthepatien tisthepreferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence. Appropriate questions includ e:
 “How are you feeling?” or “How does your child seem to feel?”
 “Have youhadany(other) medical problem ssince your lastvisit/contact?” or
 “Has your child hadany(other) medical problems orseem to actdifferently in 
any way since his/her last visit/contact?”
 “Have youtaken any new medicines, other than those provided inthis study, 
since your lastvisit/contact?” or“Has your child needed totake anymedicines,
other than those provided in this study, since his/her last visit/contact?”
11.4 Disease -Related Events and/or Disease- Relate dOutcome sNotQualifyin g asSAEs
An event which ispart of thenatural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease 
progression orhospitalization due todiseas eprogression) doesnotneed to be reported as an
SAE. Death due to diseas eunder study is to be recorde d on theDeath eCRFform. However,
iftheunderlyin gdisease (i.e., progression) isgreater than that whic hwould normally be
expected forthe patien t, or ifthe investigator considers that there was a causal 
relationship between treatment with study medication(s) or protocol design/procedures and 
the disease progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.
11.5 R ecording ofAEs andSAEs
When anAE/SAE occurs, it is theresponsibility oftheinvestigator torevie w all 
documentation (e.g.,hospital progres snotes, laboratory, anddiagnostics reports) relative to
theevent. The investigator willthen record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in 
the appropriate data collection tool.
It is not acceptable fortheinvestigator tosend photocopies ofthepatien t’smedical 
records toNovartis orCOG in lieu of completion oftheNovartis AE/SAE data collection
tool. However, theremay beinstances when copies ofmedical records forcertain cases are 
Novartis Confidential Page 91
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
requested byNovartis and COG. In thisinstance ,allpatien tidentifiers, with theexception
of thepatient numbe r(both COG and Novartis studynumbers),will be blinded on the copies 
of the medical records prior to submission to Novartis .
The investigator willattem pt toestablish adiagnosis oftheevent based on signs, symptoms ,
and/or other clinical information. Insuch cases, thediagnosis will be documented as the 
AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.
11.6 E valuating AEs and SAEs
11.6.1 Assessment of Intensity
Theinvestigator will make anassessment of intensit yforeach AEand SAE
reported during the study and will assign it to one of the following categories:
Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the patien t, causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities.
Moderate: Anevent that is sufficiently discomfortin g to interfere with normal 
everyday activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities
An AE that is assesse dassevere willnot be confuse d with anSAE.Severit y is a 
category utilize d for ratingthe intensit y of an event,and both AEsandSAE scan 
beassessed assevere. Anevent isdefined as‘serious’ when itmeets atleast one 
of the pre -defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE.
11.6.2 Assessment of Causality
Theinvestigator isobligated toassess therelationship between study treatment and
theoccurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility" ismeant to conve y that 
there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a
relationship cannot beruled out. The investigator will useclinica l judgment to
determine therelationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and thetemporal
relationship oftheevent tothe study treatment willbe considered and investigated.
The investigator will alsoconsult theInvestigator Brochure (IB)and/or Product
Information, for marketed products, inthe determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE theinvestigator mustdocumen t in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
11.7 Follo w-up of AEs and SAEs
After theinitial AE/SAE report, theinvestigator isrequired toproactively follow each 
patient atsubsequent visits/contacts. AllAEs andSAEswill be followed until resolution, 
until thecondition stabilizes, until theevent isotherwise explained, oruntil thepatient is lost 
to follo w-up.
Theinvestigator isobligated toperfor m or arrange fortheconduct ofsupplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by Novartis to elucidate
asfully aspossible thenature and/or causalit y oftheAE or SAE.The inves tigator isobligated 
toassist. This mayinclude additional laboratory testsor investigations, histopathological 
examinations orconsultation with other health care professionals. If a patient dies during
participation inthestudy or durin g a recognized follo w-up period, the investigator will 
Novartis Confidential Page 92
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
provide Novartis with acopy ofany pos t-mortem findings, including histopathology.
New or updated informatio nwill be recorded intheoriginally complete ddata collection tool.
Theinvestigator will submit anyupdated SAEdata toNovartis within thedesignated 
reporting time frames
11.8 Prompt Reporting ofSAEs toNovartis and COG
Once theinvestigator determines that anevent meet stheprotocol definition of an SAE, 
theSAEwill bereported to Novartis andCOG within 24 hours .Anyfollo w-up information 
on a previously reported SAEwillalso be reported to Novartis andCOGwithin 24 hour s. If 
theinvestigator does nothaveallinformation regardin ganSAE, he/she will notwait to 
receive additional information before notifyin g Novartis and COG oftheevent and 
completing theappropriat edata collection tool. Theinvestigator will always provid ean 
assessment ofcausality at thetime oftheinitial report asdescribed inSection 11.6.2 , 
Assessment of Causality.
Theprimar ymechanis mforreporting SAEs toNovartis andCOG wil l be the electronic data 
collection tool. If the electronic syste m is unavailable forgreater than 24hours, the site will 
use the paper SAE data collection tool and fax it tothe number included in the Study 
Procedures Manua l. Then thesitewillenter theSAE data intotheelectronic systemas soon 
asit becomes available.
After the study iscompleted atagivensite, theelectronic data collection tool (e.g., 
DataLab s™system) will betaken off-line to prevent theentry ofnew data or change sto 
existing data. If asitereceive s arepor t of a new SAEfrom astudy participant orreceives 
updated data on a previousl yreported SAEafter the electronic datacollection tool has been
taken off-line, thesitecanreport thisinformation on a paper SAE form or to their Novartis
protocol contact by telephone.
Novartis contacts forSAEreceipt can be found atthebeginning ofthisprotoco l on the
Sponsor Information page.
11.9 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification ofSAEs by theinvestigator to Novartis isessential sothat legal 
obligations andethical responsibilities towards thesafety ofpatien tsaremet.Novartis has a 
legal responsibility tonotifyboth thelocal regulator yauthority and other regulatory 
agencies about thesafety of aprodu ct under clinical investigation. Novartis willcomply with 
country specific regulatory requirements relatin g tosafety reporting toregulatory authorities, 
IRBs /Independent Ethics Committees ( IECs)and investigators.
Investigator safety report sareprepare d for suspecte dunexpected serious adverse 
reactions according tolocal regulatory requirements and Novartis policy and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator
safety repor tdescribing an SAE(s) or other specific safety information (e.g., summary
orlistingof SAEs) from Novartis willfileitwith theIBand will notify the IRB/IEC, 
if appropriate according to local requirements.

13.6 APPENDIX IV: URINE PROTEIN TOCREATININE (UPC) RATIO
Clinical Meaning of UPC
There isagoodcorrelatio nbetween theratio ofurine protein tourine creatinine concentrations (UPC )in 
arando murine sampl eandtheamount ofprotein excreted in a 24-hour urine collection period.48Thus, 
the UPC ratio from a single random urine sampl e permits estimation ofthe 24-hour urine protein excretion.
Thecreatinine excretion isfairly constant throughout thedayregardless ofchanges inurine flow rate:
Men excrete 20 mg to 25 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day
Women excrete 15mgto20mgofcreatinine/kg ofbody weight/day
Normal protein excretion is <100 mg to 150 mg per 24 hours.
The UPC ratio is roughly equal to the 2 4-hour urine protein excretion in g/day
Calculating UPC Ratio
UPCratio =(Urine protei n[mg/dL]) /(urine creatinine [mg/dL]) =numerically equivalent tograms(g)
protein excreted in urine over 24 hours.
Exampl e: If a patient has a urine protein concentration of 90 mg/d Landurine creatinine concentration of
30 mg/dL,
then UPC ratio = 90(mg/dL )= 3
30(mg/dL)
UPC ratio of 3 correl atesto rou ghly 3g of protein excretion in a 24 -hour period.
Units for UPC ratio
UPC is a calculated ratio.Theguidelines intheprotocol arebased onhavin gurine protein andurine
creatinine measured in the same units (e.g., mg/dL). The International System of Un its (SI) units for urine 
protein andurine creatinin eare not thesame ,sothese must be converte d tomg/d Lbefore calculating the 
ratio. For reference, the conversion factors forcommonl yused units forprotei n and creatinine are provided 
below.
Starting units Conversion to mg/dL
Protein (g/L) Multiply by 100
Creatinine (mol/L) Divide by 88.4
Creatinine (mmol/L) Multiply by 11.3

13.9 APPENDIX VII: INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENT/CAREGIVER FOR ADMINISTERING 
PAZOPANIB ORAL SUSPENSION
Patient name:
Investigator/study staff: Please fill in the dose in section A.
This document provides instructions for patients/caregivers on the administration and storage of pazopanib 
suspension. It also details how to cleanupintheevent of a spill. Anyleftover medication shouldbe 
returned toyour doctor. Youshould read theinformation onthese pages before yougiveyour child the 
suspension. Please read these instructions carefully and askyour doctor about any questions you 
may have.
A. Administration:
1. The pharmacist should insert the provided adapte r (Baxa 28 mm Press-In-B ottle Adapter - PIBA® )
intotheneck of thebottle. Once theadapte rhasbeen placed into thebottle neck,DONOT 
REMOV E.
2. Immediately before planned dose administration, mix the contents of the bottle by swirling for30 
seconds to one minute in order to ensure homogeneity of suspension.
3. Note #1:Wome nwhoarepregnan t ornursin gshoul d puton a suitable size ofgloves toavoid 
contact between theliquidand skin(Latex gloves canbeused; however ,forpeople who are 
sensitive tolatex, it is recommended touseNitrile gloves). Take carenottospread material to 
unprotected skin (such as your face) or other body surfaces by touching them with a wet glove. 
Note #2: In case of spillage, see section C for Clea n-up instructions .
3. Insert thetipofanappropriate syring e(recommended: Exacta -Med® Baxa) intotheAdapter after 
ensuring that the syringe plunger is pushed fully into the barrel.
4. Tipthebottle upside down anddispens e atleast 3-5 mL of suspension intothesyringe. Then push 
thesuspension backinto the bottle inorder topurge the syring e of anyairbubbles. Repea tthis 
step until syringe is free of air bubbles.
5. Withdraw the prescribed dose. Investigator/study staff will fill in the dose below for each patient.
The dose is mg, corresponding to mL each day.
Please note thatthenumber ofmilligram s ofpazopanib and,therefore, the number of milliliters of 
pazopanib oralsuspension maychange asthebodysurface area of the patient changes durin gstudy 
participation.
6. After youhavegivenyour child thedose, pull theplungers out of allthesyringes andrinse the 
syringes andplungers withwarmwater for30seconds. When dry, place theplungers back into 
their syringes and store them for the next time.
7. Pazopanib is to be given orally (bymouth) only.
8. The dose should be given on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) once daily.
9. If your child’s study doctor prescribed medicine toprevent nausea orvomitin gwith pazopanib, 
you should give your child this medicine 30 -60 minutes before you give pazopanib.
10. If your child spits out orvomit s a dose of pazopanib, it should not be repeated.
11. If a dose ismissed ,itmay be givenwithin 12hours ofthetime itwasdue. Beyon d 12 hoursthat 
dose should beskipped. The next dose should be given at itsregularly schedule dtime. For
example, if the dose was due at 8am, then the dose may be given up to 8pm that same day.
B.Storage and returning partially used and unused bottles:
1. The pazopanib suspension should be refrigerated in its bottle (2° to 8° C, or 36° to46°F ).
2. Pazopanib must be kept out of reach of children.
3. Anyused andunused bottles ofpazopanib should bereturned totheinvestigator/clinic ateach

Pazopanib will be administere d orally once daily as a tablet at a dose of 450 mg/m2/dose or as a powder in 
suspension at a dose of 160 mg/m2/dose (theMTD s determined by Part 1andPart 2Arespectively of 
ADVL0815, the COG Phase I study). The maximum dose to be administered daily is 800 mg. Each cycle will
bedefined as 28 days. Note : Thefirst10patients enrolled willreceiv ethesuspension formulation during Cycle 
1 in order to obtain pharmacokinetic da ta. Those patients may switch to the tablet formulation forCycle 2 and
subsequent cycles ifthepatient isable toswallo wtablets andmeets the minimu mBSA requirements for
tablets. Please note,theprescribed dose forthetablet andsuspension formula tion is different (see Section 
4.1).
Patients with benefit (stable disease oranobjective response) may continue therapy for up to 2 years(in the
absence ofunacceptable treatment related toxicity) unless there isevidence ofprogressive disease or 
unac ceptable treatmen t-related toxicity.
Experimental	Design	Schema	Revised	Text:
Pazopanib will be administered orally once dailyas a tablet at 450 mg/m2/dose or as a powder in suspension
at 225 mg/m2/dose . The maximu mtolerated dose (MTD) fortablets was 450mg/m2/dose as determined by
ADVL0815, theCOG Phase I study, while thedose fororal suspension of225 mg/m2/dose exceeds the
protocol- specified MTD of160 mg/m2/dose established inthat study .The225 mg/m2/dose is where two 
isolated laboratory -defined dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. The maximu mdose to be 
administered daily for tablets is 800 mg. The maximum dose to be administered daily for suspension is 400 
mg. Each cycle will be defined as 28 days.
The first 6 patients enrolled who receiv e suspension will be expecte d to complete extended pharmacokinetic
(PK)sampling (Section 7.3.2) inorder toobtain PKandsafetydata. These data will be reviewed prior to
further enrollment ofpatients requiring suspension todetermine if225 mg/m2/dose is tolerated and PK
exposur e is similar toexposure in adults associated with clinica lefficacy . Ifthe225 mg/m2/dose isnot
tolerated (≥2dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 6 evaluable patients), thedose for patients who require 
suspension may be reduced to 160 mg/ m2/dose.

treated with sunitinib, another VEGF andc-kittargeting multityrosine kinase inhibito r, biomarker analysis of 
CECs, monocytes, VEGF, and sVEGF R-2 were consistently modulated by treatment. In this study, changes in 
CECs and monocytes rather than plasma markers differed between the patients with clinical benefit andthose
with progressive disease.39 Inpediatric patients with refractory solid tumors treated with the VEGF
neutralizing antibod ybevacizumab, patients with prolonge ddisease stabilization (> 3 months ) hadagreater 
contribution ofapoptotic CEC tothetotal CEC number (aCEC/tCE C)after 4week s oftherapy (p=0.04), a
finding also reported inbreast cancer patients who responded tometronomic therapy.40,41 Thisstudy will
continue to examine theeffects ofpazopanib therapy on cytokines and angiogenic factors.

Section	4.4	Permitted	Medications –Use	with	Caution,	Added	Text:
Results from drug-drug interaction studies conducted in subjects with cancer suggest that pazopanib has no 
effect onthemetabolis m of S- warfarin. Hemorrhagic events, however, have been repor tedinclinical 
studies with pazopanib; therefore, pazopanib should be used with caution in subjects with increased risk of 
severe bleedin g or whoarebenefitting from treatmen tand require theinitiation ofconcomitant 
anticoagulant therapy (e.g.,warfarin orits derivatives, lowmolecular weigh theparin, unfractionated hepari n)
whileonstudy. Note: Subjects areexcluded fromenrolling onthestudy ifthey aretaking therapeutic
doses of S- warfarin at thetime ofscreening. Subjects taking concomitant anticoagulant therapy should be
monitored regularly forchange s inrelevant coagulation parameters asclinically indicated, as well as for any 
clinical bleeding episodes.
Section	4.5.4	Added	Text:
Concomitant administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole decreases the bioavailability of pazopanib by 
40% (AUC and Cmax), and co -administration of pazopanib with medicines that increase gastric pH should be 
avoided. Co-administration of pazopanib with medicines that increase gastric pH isPROHIBITE D from 
24 hours before the first dose of pazopanib until after the final PK blood sample is collected on Day 15 
± 1 day of Cycle 1. After this, if the concomitant use of a proto n-pump inhibitor (PPI) is medically necessary, 
it is recommended that the dose of pazopanib be taken without food once daily in the evening concomitantly 
with the PPI(Section 4.8). If the concomitant administration of an H2-receptor antagonist is medically 
necessary, pazopanib should be taken without food at least 2 hours before or at least 10 ho urs after a dose of 
an H2-receptor antagonist. Pazopanib should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after 
administration of short -acting antacids.

who must take these medications should be watched carefully for symptoms of QTc prolongation, such 
as syncope. Performing additional EKGs on patients who must take oneormore ofthesemedications is
recommended butnotrequired, attheinvestigator’s discretion.
Section	4.8	Prohibited	Medications,	Added	Text:

hydrocortisone (>40 mg), prednisone (>10 mg), methylprednisolone (>8 mg), 
dexamethasone (>1.5 mg)
Grapefruit or grapefruit juice is prohibited as it inhibits CYP3A4 activity and may also increase 
plasma concentrations of pazopanib.
Asnoted above, co -administration ofpazopan ib with medicines that increase gastric pH is 
prohibited from 24 hours before the first dose of pazopanib until after the final PK blood sample is

Thefirstpatients enrolled who receiv e powder suspension will be expected tocomplete extended pharmacokinetic 
(PK) sampling (Section 7.3.2) in order to obtain PK and safety data in 6 evaluable patients. If the 225mg/m2/dose 
isnot tolerated (≥2patients with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) inthefirst6evaluable patients), subsequent new 
patients willbeenrolled atthe160 mg/m2/dose level until 6evaluable patients are available for the safety review 
and the PK anal ysis.
Patients withbenefit (stable diseas e or an objective response) maycontinue therap yunless there is evidence of

Section 2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Phase II Trial, Previous Text:
This is a two- stage open label phase II trialofpazopanib inchildren, adolescents andyoungadults with recurrent 
or refractory solid tumo rs. Tumors of prima ry interest are rhabdomyosarcoma , non-
rhabdomyosarcoma tous softtissue sarcoma (includin gsynovia lsarcoma ,alveolar softpart sarco maand 
desmoplastic smallround celltumor) andEwin g sarcoma. Tumors of seconda ry interest inclu de hepatoblastoma, 
neuroblastoma (measurable and evaluable), andosteosarcoma.
Eligible patients will recei ve pazopanib daily as an oral tablet (450 mg/m2/dose ) or as a powde r for suspension
(225 mg/m2/dose) in 28 daycycles. Themaxim umdose to be administered daily for tablets is
800 m g and for suspension 400 mg. Patients wi ll be closely monitored with clinical and laboratory
observations foradverse effec ts.Response will be evaluated using appropriate imagi ng studies after the
2ndcycle of pazopanib, after the4thcycle, andthen every3rdcycle thereafter (baseline, prior to Cy cle3, prior
toCycle 5, prior to Cycle 8,prior to Cycle 11,etc). In theabsence ofsever etoxicity orprogressive disease, 
patients may continue receiving pazopanib.
This study will dose patients requiring suspension with a startin g dose of 225 mg/m2/dose.. The previously -defined
suspension MTD of 160 mg/m2/dose may resul t in suboptima lexposure todemonstrate efficacy. Two of 4
patients intheprior Phase I study demonstrated DLT s in the formof isolated and reversible Grad e 3 elevations 
in ALT at 225 mg/m2/dose. Given that this toxicity was isolated and reversible, thefirst 6patients receiving
suspension will be dosed at225 mg/m2/doseandassessed forfirst-cycle DLTs befor econtinui ng to enroll
additional patients requiring suspension. If two or more of 6 patients demonstrate DLT, then thedose may be de-

Section 2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Phase II Trial, Revised Text:
This is a two- stageopen label phase II trial ofpazopani b inchildren, adolescents andyoun g adults with recurrent 
or refractory solid tumors . Tumors of primar y interest are rhabdomyosarcoma, non-
rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcom a(includin gsynovial sarcoma, alveolarsoft part sarcom aand 
desmoplastic small round cell tumor) andEwin gsarcoma/peripheral PNET. Tumors ofsecondary interest
include hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma (measurable and evaluable), and osteosarcoma.
Each tumor type defines a cohort resulting in7total cohorts. The first stage of the study involves enrolling an 
initial 10patients intoeach cohort. The response ratewillbedetermined foreach cohort after thetarget enrollment
of 10 patients isreached forthatcohort. Ifone or moreconfirme dresponses are observe d in the first 10
evaluable patients in a cohort, an additional 10patients will beenrolled into thatcohort inthesecond stage of
study . Thus, forcohort(s) with one or moreconfirmed responses inthefirst stage ofstudy , atotalof20 patients 
will be enrolled and evaluated to determine efficacy.
Eligible patients will receiv e pazopanib monotherapy. Pazopanib will bedosed daily as an oraltablet (450 
mg/m2/dose, maximu m 800 mg) or as a powder fororalsuspension (225 mg/m2/dose, maximu m 400 mg) in 28 
day cycles.
The MTD forpazopani btablets was 450 mg/m2/dose asdetermined byADVL0815/PZP114411, theCOG 
Phase I study inchildren with relapsed orrefractory solid tumors. Forthepowder suspension formulation, the 
selected startin gdose ishighe rthan theprotoco l-defined MTD of 160mg/m2/doseestablished inADVL0815. This 
decision is driven by the considerations that the 160 mg/m2/dose may result in exposure that is suboptimal to
demonstrate efficacy andthat only twoisolated andreversible laboratory -defined DLTs were observed at the 
225 mg/ m2/dose.
The first patients who areenrolled toreceiv epazopani baspowder suspension at225mg/m2/dose daily willbe 
closely monitored forsafetyand for the occurrenc e of dose-limiting toxicit y durin g the first cycle (28 days) of 
therapy. Patients who either receiv e 225 mg/m2/dose daily for at least 24 days(85% ofthedose fora 28- day 
cycle with powder suspension at 225mg/m2/dose) orarewithdrawn fromdosing due to on e ormoreprotoco l-
defined dose-limiting toxicities (Section 5.1) during the first cycle will be considered evaluable for the purpose of 
this safety review. Six evaluable patients are required.
The first patients enrolled toreceive powder suspension at225 mg/m2/dose will also beexpected tocomplete 
extended PKsampling (Section 7.3.2) with blood sample scollected prior to dosing, and 30 m in, 1, 2, 4, 6, and8
hours after thepazopani bdose onDay 1 and Day 15 ± 1 day of Cycle 1(with nopazopanib dose
modif ication or adjustment in the 10 days before Cycle 1 Day 15 sample collection). Patients who can provide 
adequate blood samples forthe2scheduled extende d PK collections will beconsidered to be evaluable 
patients for the purpose of this PK analysis, and PK data are required from 6 evaluable patients. If one or more of
the first 6patients fails toprovide blood samples asspecified intheprotocol or if it is know nthatforsome reason
apatient’s collecte dblood sample(s) cannot beanalyzed ,that patient will bedetermined to be non- evaluable 
for this analysis, and one or more additional patients will be enrolled for treatment with pazopanib as powder 
suspension for the purpose of obtaining the extended PK samples.
Because patients receiving thepowder suspension enrolled inthesafetyreview group may be different from those 
in the PK analysis group, enrollment onto powder suspensi on may follow several different paths:
If ≥ 2 outof 6 evaluable patients havedose-limitin gtoxicities (DLT andasdefined in 
Section 5.1) within the first cycle, then enrollment onto 225 mg/m2/dose pazopanib will be 
halted. Subsequent newpatients willbeenrolled atthe160mg/m2/dose level until 6 evaluable
patients fromthisdose group are available forthesafety review and6 patients are available 
Novartis Confidential Page 140
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
for PK analysis at 160 mg/ m2/dose.
If 6PKevaluable patients areenrolled prior to enrollment of6patients whoareevaluable for 
the safety review, the extended PK sample collection may be suspended.
If < 2 DLTs areobserved during thefirst cycle in 6 patients evaluable forsafety at 225 
mg/m2/dose and these 6patients arenotallevaluable forthePK analysis, then enrollment 
will continue until 6 PK evaluable patients are available.
All patients will be closely monitored with clinical and laboratory observations for adverse effects.
Tumor response will be evaluated using appropriate imaging assessments at baseline, prior to Cycle 3, Cycle 5, 
Cycle 8, Cycle 11 and then every 3rdcycle thereafter.
 
Inaddition, we willassess KDR polymorphism andpazopanib -induced chang e
insoluble VEGFR2; VEGF -Agenotype andchanges inVEGF -Aconcentration; KDR andVEGF -A genotypes
andresponse rate, andprogression -free survival; andcandidate SNPsandclinical endpoints as identified in the 
adult population.
Theprimary analysis will beperforme d 20 weeks after thelastpatient’s firstvisit inthe three cohorts of primary
interest (rhabdomyosarcoma , non- rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcom aand Ewing sarcoma/peripheral 
PNET).
Thestudywill be complete d one yearfrom the date of the last patient’s first visit and the end of study analysis 
will be performed at the time of study completion.

ADVL0815, theCOG Phase Istudy,while thedosefororal suspension of 225 mg/m2/dose exceeds the 
protocol-s pecified MTD o f 160 mg/m2/dose established in that study. Two isol ated and reversible laborato ry-
defined DLT swere observed at 225 mg/m2/dose. The maximum dose to be administered daily fortablets is
800 mg andforsuspension 400 mg . Each cyclewill bedefined as28 da ys.
Note: Thefirst6patients enrolled whoreceive suspension willbeexpected tocomplete extended PK sampling
(Section 7.3.2)inorder to obtain PK andsafety data. These datawillbereviewed prior tofurther enrollment
ofpatients requiring suspension todetermine if 225 mg/m2/dose istolerated andPKexpo sureis similar to
exposure in adults associated with clinical efficacy. If 225 mg/m2/dose is not t olerated (≥2 DLTs in 6
evaluable patients), the dose for patients who require suspension may be reduced to160 mg/m2/dose.
Acyclewill bedefined as 28 da yswith norest periods between cycles. Patient swith bene fit(stable 
diseaseoranobjective response) may continue therapy unless there is evidence ofprogressiv e disease or 
unacceptable treatment-relatedtoxici ty.
Patients must remain on the same formulatio n of pazopanib throughout theduration of th eir protocol
therapy.
Drug dosing forthetablet formulation should bedetermined using thedosing nomogram inAppendix II. 
Forpatients receiving powder forsuspension (50 mg/m L),thedose will berounde d to thenearest 5 mg . 
Drug doses should b e adjus tedbased on the BSAasdetermined by the heigh tand weigh tobtain ed within 1

Pazopanib should betaken on anemptystom ach(atleast 1hour befor e ameal or 2 hours after ameal) at 
approx imately thesametimeeach day.Pazopanib tablets should betakenwith clear liquids (approx imately 4 
ounces for children < 12 year s of age and4-8ounces for children ≥12 years of age). Pazopanib suspension
should be taken according toinstructions inAppendix VII.Thepazopanib suspension should beswirle dfor
atleast 30second sprior to rem oval ofthedosefrom thebottle, which should be given imm ediatel y.If a 
patient vomits after a dose of pazopanib, the dose shoul dnotbe repeated.

Pazopanib willbedosed daily asanoraltablet at450mg/m2/dose orasapowder fororalsuspension at225 
mg/m2/dose.
For the tablet formulation, the maximu mtolerated dose (MTD) was 450 mg/m2/dose as determined by
ADVL0815/PZP114411, theCOG Phase Istudy. The maximu mdose to be administered daily fortablets is
800mg.
For the powder suspension formulation, the selected starting dose is 225 mg/m2/dose, higher than theprotoco l-
specified MTD of 160 mg/m2/dose established instudy ADVL0815. This decision isdriven bythe considerations
thatthe160mg/m2/dose mayresult in exposure thatissuboptimal todemonstrate efficac yand that onlytwo
isolated andreversible laborator y-defined dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) wereobserved atthe225 mg/m2/dose.
The maximum dose to be administered daily for oral suspension is 400 mg.

Mild to Moderate abdominal pain or other
abdominal complaints with no associated 
abnormal findings on physical exam1. Continue pazopanib at current dose
2. Implement supportive care as 
indicated and per institutional
standards; consider imaging studies
3. Advise the patient to seek medical 
attention should their complaints
worsen
4. Appropri ate follo w-up until complaints 
resolve or origin of the pain is 
identified. Imaging studies to confirm 
the absence of abdominal pathology 
should be performed based on the 
investigator judgment.
Severe abdominal pain or a concerning
abdominal exam1. Hold pa zopanib
2. Recommend to obtain appropriate 
imaging studies to evaluate the 
patient’s specific complaints or exam

non-childbearing potential. If a female patient is of childbearing potential, she must have a serum -Human
Chorionic Gonadotropin ( %-HCG) pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the first dose of study 
treatment(s). P atients with a positive pregnancy test result must be excluded from the study. Patients with a 
negative pregnancytest result must agree to use an ad equate contracep tion method as described below during
the study until 30 days following the last dose of study treatment(s). Any pregnancy that occurs during study
participation must be reported using a clinical t rial pregnancy form. To ensure patient safety, each 
pregnancy must be reported to NovartisGSK within 24 hours 2 weeks of learning of its occurrence. Study 
treatment should be immediately discontinued if pregnancy occurs during study participation. The pregnancy

Brief Summary  This study will test two types of  electronic health record (EHR) -based alerts to 
improve guideline- adherent care for patients with heart failure and reduced 
ejection fraction (HFrEF). Alerts will be triggered for patients with ejection 
fraction (EF) ≤  40% who are not on guideline- recommended medical therapy. 
The two types of alerts tested will be a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and an 
electronic message.  
Objectives  To test two types of EHR -based alerts that  promote appropriate medical 
therapy for patients with HFrEF.  
Methodology  Prospective cohort study  
Endpoint s Primary endpoint : medication prescribing patterns   
Secondary endpoint : hospitalization and mortality  
Study Duration  Eighteen months  
Participant Duration  Eighteen months  
Population  Patients with EF ≤  40% 
Study Sites  One single health system,  NYULH , consists of approximately 60 outpatient 
cardiology pract ices.  
Number of participants  Up to 2000 participants  
Statistical Analysis  We will begin all analyses with descriptive summary statistics and graphical 
displays of all variables. Primary analyses will utilize McNemar’s tests  for 
medication prescriptions and patient outcomes of hospitalization and 
mortality. We will adjust for patient demographics and clinical characteristics, as well as provider -level characteristics, such as demographics, panel size, 
insurance mix, and sub -specialty training.

 1 Introduction, Background Information and Scientific Rationale 
1.1 Background  Information and Relevant Literature  
 
For patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the cornerstone of evidence- based 
care includes several medications that have been found to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, which include: 1) mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRA), 2) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ACE -I/ARB/ARNI), and 3) beta-
blockers (BB). Current guidelines give these medications a class I recommendation,
1 and recently 
published performance measures2 also strongly recommend these agents.  However, despite their well-
accepted benefits, several prior studies have revealed significant gaps in medical therapy for HFrEF patients.
3-5 Using number -needed- to-treat estimates based on data f rom randomized trials, these gaps in 
medical therapy account for an estimated 68,000 deaths per year nationwide, with the largest proportion being from lack of appropriate MRA therapy.
6  
In prior studies, successful interventions for improvement have often included multidisciplinary approaches with nurses, pharmacists, or other trained individuals.
7-9 However, the need for dedicated staff can be costly, 
and electronic health record (EHR) -based interventions could be a potential cost -effective solution. Prior 
studies assessing the efficacy of EHR -based interventions to improve medical therapy for HFrEF have 
mainly been conducted in the inpatient setting.10-12 Inpatient algorithms may be limited as they reflect one 
instance in time. Additionally, acute hospitalization may restrict the ability to add multiple agents due to renal dysfunction or hypotension. Therefore, we propose the development of an outpatient EHR -based 
system to target patients with HFrEF who are not on the appropriate therapy.  
Outpatient provider -facing EHR -based interventions could include best practice alerts (BPA) or electronic  
messages.  While limited data exist for both types of interventions, some studies have observed significant 
improvements in health outcomes.
13-15 Potential adverse effects have also been described, such as 
increased alert frequency with BPAs14 and physician burnout with electronic  messages.16 Given the 
potential for benefit and/or harm, it is imperative to study such interventions with rigor. Currently, no study direct ly compares different types of EHR -based alerts.  
In this study, we aim to test a  BPA and an electronic  message for  HFrEF patients who are not on guideline-
recommended therapy. This work is significant because it aims to reduce gaps in medical therapy for H FrEF 
patients, which we hope will reduce mortality, decrease hospitalizations, and improve symptoms.  
We will not be directly recruiting or enrolling patients. However, we will be monitoring patients  for clinical 
outcomes  using EHR data and are requesting a waiver of authorization and consent . 
We will also conduct a survey to assess provider acceptability and perceived usefulness and ease of use of the BPA and electronic messages. This survey will be sent to the cardiologists at NYULH who received the BPA and electronic messages.  
1.2 Rationale  
This study aims to evaluate  EHR -based alerts  to improve adherence to guideline -recommended medical 
therapy  among patients with HFrEF .  
Understanding provider feedback on the BPA and electronic messages is necessary to understanding why these EHR tools may or may not work to improve care. For example, the BPA may be more effective at improving prescribing, and the surveys could help us understand if this was because cardiologists 
thought that they were easier  to use.  Moreover, there may be drawbacks, such as increased time needed 
during visits due to the BPAs or electronic messages.  The only way to obtain this type of information is 
from the cardiologists at NYULH who received the BPAs and electronic messages,  as they are the only 
ones who can comment on the acceptability, usefulness, and ease of use of the EHR tools.

 1.3 Potential  Risks & Benefits 
1.3.1  Known Potential Risks  
The risk is not greater than minimal risk (i.e., risk encountered in daily life or in the course of usual 
clinical practice). Individual case determinations of potential safety gaps will never  be released to 
supervisors of any clinicians whose charts are  being reviewed.  
The principal risk of the study, as for any medical record review, is inadvertent  release of confidential 
patient information. We will avoid such inadvertent disclosure by storing all identifiable information on a 
secure server and restricting access to the data to authorized study personnel.  
 
For provider surveys, we expect the level of risk due to this study to be minimal. Potential risks to 
providers may include the following issues listed.  
• Coercion/Undue Influence: The study will include NYULH employees. Participants may feel coerced or under pressure to participate in the survey or  provide positive remarks about their 
work activities. Staff will be informed that participation is solely voluntary and has no bearing on their employment status  or salary . Additionally, employee’s will be informed that their decision 
to participate in the research study may not affect (favorably or unfavorably) performance evaluations, career advancement, or other employment -related decisions made by peers or 
supervisors.  
• Discomfort:  Participants may feel uncomfortable answering some of the study questions. They 
will be informed that they can refuse to answer any questions they wish. The information that 
we are retrieving is not sensitive in nature and we do not expect it to be of concern to the participant.  
1.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
There may be benefit to individual patients for whom alerts may be triggered in this pilot study  if their care 
is improved to comport with guidelines . The research will contribute critically to our knowledge of EHR -
based alerts.   
 
For the provider surveys, the information gained will put the effectiveness results into context (for 
example, help explain why one type worked better than another). Additionally, from an institutional quality improvement perspective, this will allow us to inform plans for next steps.  The information gained from 
these surveys may also be beneficial to the providers themselves, as the feedback from this could impact next steps for the institution  and future workflow within the EHR . 
 
2 Objectives and Purpose 
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate  EHR -based alerts to promote appropriate medical 
therapy for patients with HFrEF.  
 
3 Study Design and Endpoints 
3.1 Description of Study Design  
NYU Langone Health has ambulatory care sites in the five boroughs of New York City (NYC) as well as in 
suburbs of New York and New Jersey. All have the NYU Epic EHR .  
3.2 Intervention  
The two t ypes of EHR -based alerts include: 1)  BPA and 2) electronic message.

 Best Practi c e Alert (BPA)  – BPAs are alerts that appear at the time of the visit, allowing for real -time 
intervention while the provider is with a patient, but also potentially interrupting provider workflow. The 
BPA appears at the beginning of a visit/encounter and includes 1) a tailored advisory, 2) educational link 
to guidelines, 3) medication information, 4) vital sign and pertinent lab results, and 5) options for next steps (i.e. ordering medication, providing reasons for not prescribing).  
Electronic Message – Unli
 ke the BPA, the  electronic message is not necessarily seen at the time of the 
visit, and is  more likely to be seen between visits. The electronic message is similar  to the BPA in terms 
of information provided, but can include information on multiple patients in the same message, and overall prescribing metrics . 
3.3 S
tudy End points  
Outcomes measured at the prescription encounter level include whether there is a  prescription for BB, 
ACE- I/ARB/ARNI, and/or MRA. Secondary patient outcomes include hospitalization,  hospitalization for 
HF, and mortality.  
3.4 Provider Surveys  
We will conduct surveys of cardiology providers after the implementation of the EHR -based 
alerts across all NYULH Cardiology locations.  The survey will aim to obtain further  
understanding of provider real -world experiences with,  and perception of the clinical decision 
support tools . We will use a mix of likert -scale, multiple -choice, and open- ended questions to 
assess the alerts based on previously reported  implementation sci ence frameworks, specifically 
focusing on acceptability, usefulness, and ease of use of the two EHR- based alerts.    
 
The goal for this survey is to obtain an overall assessment of the EHR -based alerts’ usefulness  as 
a long- term strategy for health system -wide quality improvement.  Past evidence suggests that 
physicians dislike clinical decision support tools, believing they have minimal utility and result in 
general inefficiency, increased time required for care , and contribute to a sense of  alert 
fatigue.  We seek to determine whether these perceived downsides of EHR -based alerts were a 
factor in providers’ impressions of the alerts used in this study.  . The final survey is attached.  
4 Study Population   
4.1 Total Number of Participants and Sites  
This is a single site study involving NYULH outpatient cardiology clinics serving a total of approximately 
2000 participants.  
4.2 Inclusion Criteria  
• Patient with an encounter visit at NYULH cardiology  practice during the study period  
• Patient with EF ≤ 40% on most recent echocardiogram 
• Patient ages 18- 100 
4.3 Exclusion Criteria  
• Pregnancy  
• Ventricular assist device  
• In order to give providers time to add and up- titrate medications, we will exclude patients who had 
a newly reduced EF in the last 3 months.  
• Medication- specific exclusion for MRA: most recent systolic blood pressure less than 105 mm Hg, 
most recent potassium < 5.1, any potassium > 5.5, most recent glomerular filtration rate < 30 (using MDRD equation), or a documented MRA allergy.

 4.4 Vulnerable Sub jects  
No vulnerable patients  will be enrolled.  
 
For the survey, we  will recruit NYULH cardiologists who received the BPAs or messages . The only way to 
obtain feedback on the BPAs and electronic messages is from the cardiologists at NYULH who received the BPAs and electronic messages, as they are the only ones who can comment on the acceptability, 
usefulness, and ease of use of these  EHR tools. Cardiologists  will be informed that their decision to 
participate or not, and their responses , will in no way affect their employment, salary, or performance 
evaluations  and they will be reminded that they can stop participating whenever they want. Their 
information will be de- identified and completely anonymous . No identifiable PII or health information will 
be collected.   
 
5 Strategies for Recruitment  
 Eligible patients  from the chosen practice sites  will be identified electronically within EPIC using an 
algorithm developed by the study team  and NYULH’s DataCore. This algorithm reviews patient records 
for EF ≤ 40% on most recent echocardiogram, and exclusion criteria listed above. Patients meeting 
eligibility will be automatically included, and all data collection will take place passively via the NYULH 
EHR system, EPIC. An EPIC reporting analyst will extract the relevant parameters from EPIC into a report.  Patients  from the selected  practice sites  will undergo their usual interactions with their providers 
and no study -specific activities will take place . 
5.1 Duration of Study Participation  
Patients’ clinical outcomes will be monitored through EHR data for 18 months . 
5.2 Participant Withdrawal or Termination  
Not applicable as the subjects are recruited at the clinic  level. 
5.3 Provider Survey Recruitment  
For the provider survey, we will recruit cardiologists who received the BPA or electronic message through 
emails (see attachment). They will be made aware that completing the survey is completely anonymous and will in no way impact their employment.  The recruitment emails will be sent via  listserv s of 
cardiologist who received the BPAs and electronic messages. These listservs are specific for those 
cardiologists who received BPAs or electronic messages and the survey does not require cardiologists to 
self-select whether they received a BPA or a message. Only cardiologists who received a BPA or 
electronic message will be contacted. We will send an initial recruitment email and a subsequent follow 
up email.  
 
The consent form will be attached to the email. It will also be available via link within the first question in 
Qaltrix . The first question in Qaltrix  asks the provider to review the consent document and requires the 
provider to click a button stating that they are consenting to participate before being shown the remaining 
survey questions. If the provider does not click this button, they will not be able to move forward or complete the survey.  
6 Study Schedule  
 
Participants will be included in this study by virtue of meeting eligibility criteria and having a patient 
enc
ounter during the study period. There are no study -specific visits.   Any patient meeting criteria who 
has one or more patient encounters during the study period will be included.  Therefore, no study -specific 
visits are relevant for this study, so there is no schedule of visits .

7 Study Pro cedures / Evaluations  
 
There are no study -specific procedures that patients will undergo. They will receive care as usual by their 
outpatient providers.  The EHR algorithm developed by the study team identifies eligible patients with EF ≤ 
40% on most recent echocardiogram, and exclusion criteria listed above.  The EHR algorithm will also 
capture information on demographics, diagnoses in the patient’s problem list, prescription history, allergies, 
EF, and relevant lab results.   For patients meeting the eligibility criteria, a message in the EHR will automatically be sent to the provider. 
The provider will receive either a Best Practice Alert (BPA) or electronic message indicating that their heart 
failure patient is not on guideline- recommended therapy. The message will offer guidance for physician 
decision -making regarding HFrEF care. The study team presented the proposed project to the NYULH 
MCIT Project Portfolio Review Committee on February 11
, 2021 and was approved to work with MCIT to 
build the electronic messages. Providers will be notified through the Weekly Epic Update and in 
presentations to medical directors that they may see the alert prior to the start of the study.  
 
Patients’ clinical outcomes will be monitored through EHR  data collection for 18 months. Data collection 
will include elements of protected health information including patient name, medical record number, 
address zip code, and service dates. These will be necessary for data linkages and in order to track patients 
for receipt of intervention and clinical outcomes. All PHI data will be kept on a secure NYULH server and destroyed at the earliest possible point.  Data on the patient’s medication prescription, hospitalization, 
hospitalization for HF, and mortality will be recorded as study outcomes. The study team members will not 
collect this information directly; data will be collected in NYULH’s EHR system, EPIC, and an EPIC 
Reporting analyst from DataCore will extract the relevant parameters from the EHR into a report.

 • R elated or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e., possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research)  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  ( including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
A
dverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tes ts 
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance 
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events.  
 
8.1.1  Investigator reporting: notifying the IRB  
Federal regulations require timely reporting by investigators to their local IRB of unanticipated problems 
posing risks to subjects or others.  The following describes the NYULMC IRB reporting requirements, though Investigators at participating sites are responsible for meeting the specific requirements of their IRB of record.  
 
Report Promptly, but no later than 5 working days:  
Researchers are required to submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no lat er than 5 working 
days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related  
– U
nexpected:  An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.  
– Related to the research procedures : A n event is related to the research procedures if in the 
opinion of the principal investigator or sponsor, the event was more likely than not to be 
caused by the research procedures.  
– Harmful :  either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk  
 Other Reportable events:  
The following events also require prompt reporting to the IRB, though no later than 5 working days :
  
• Complaint of a research subject when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by the research team.

writing by the study sponsor  
 • P rotocol deviations or violations  (includes intentional and accidental/unintentional deviations 
from the IRB approved protocol) for any  of the following situations:  
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm  
– the event has the potential to occur again  
– the deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm  
• B reach of confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant when the  research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• New Information indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits  of  the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. (e.g. analysis indicates lower -than- expected response rate or a 
more severe or frequent side effect; Other research finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; 
FDA labeling change or withdrawal from market)  
 
R
eporting Process  
The reportable events noted above will be reported to the IRB using a Reportable New Information 
submission and will include a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the 
above criteria, follow -up/resolution, and need for revision to consent form and/or other study 
documentation. Copies of each report and documentation of IRB notification and receipt will be kept in the 
Clinical Investigator’s study file.  
 
9 Statistical Considerations 
9.1 Study Hypotheses  
Patient in clinics receiving the EHR- based alerts  will have higher rates of adherence to guideline 
recommended medical therapy . 
Providers will like the EHR -based alerts and will want to continue to use them in their practice.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
In order to have 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in prescribing for each intervention 
arm vs. control, we will require a total of at least 1503 patients (501 per arm).  Based on prior 
data, we estimate that alerts will trigger for a sample between 1500- 2000 patients, but are 
unable to accurately control the specific number of patients due to fluctuating clinical volume at 
practices.  
9.3 Statistical Methods  
We will begin all analyses with descriptive summary statistics and graphical displays of all variables. Primary analyses will utilize  McNemar’s tests for medication prescriptions and patient outcomes of 
hospitalization and mortality. We will adjust for patient demographics and clinical characteristics, as well as provider -level characteristics, such as demographics, panel size, insurance mix, and sub- specialty 
training.  
9.4 Provider Survey Assessment  
Answers from surveys will be tabulated with descriptive statistics.  
10 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents

CONFIDENTIAL

writing by the study sponsor  
 The EPIC electronic health record is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  Study -specific 
case report forms will not be used.  
 
Access to study records will be limited to IRB -approved members of the study team. The investigator will 
permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB/EC, the sponsor, government 
regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. , source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. , 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
11 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects 
11.1 Ethical Standard  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46.  
11.2 Institutional Review Board 
A request for waiver of  informed consent, and request for waiver of HIPAA authorization  will be submitted 
to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of the protocol , the waiver of consent , and the waiver of 
HIPAA authorization  must be obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol 
will require review and approval by the IRB before the changes are implemented to the study.  
11.3 Informed Consent Process  
We will obtain a waiver of informed consent  and a waiver of HIPAA authorization for patients seen in the 
participating clinics  to acknowledge their participation at a c linic level. The risks to subjects are exactly 
equivalent to the risks experienced in the standard setting of patient care. The new module to be activated in EPIC relates only to guidance for physician decision- making regarding HFrEF  care, and has 
no impact on disclosure or treatment of PHI.  Patients will receive care from their providers in the usual 
way.  The only difference is the interface with the electronic health record that is used by the physician during the course of the patient encounter.  The autonomy of the provider to make decisions about patient care will not be affected.  It is impracticable to obtain consent from patients for receipt of standard medical 
care by their usual providers.  It is unclear what they would be providing consent for, since they will receive care as usual from their providers.  Patients will not be provided with additional information.  They 
will be treated as usual by their providers and the providers’ experience with the module is irrelevant to their patient experience.  
 For provider surveys, we are requesting a waiver of documentation of consent. These surveys present no more than minimal risk to providers. Prior to beginning survey questions, providers will be given consent 
form that contains all pertinent study  and contact information. The consent form will be attached to the 
recruitment email and also will be available via link in Qaltrix prior to the survey. The provider s will be asked 
to acknowledge consent through clicking a button within Qaltrixbefore they are able to participate in  the 
survey questions. Providers will be informed that they may agree not to participate and that this will have 
no bearing on their employment status.

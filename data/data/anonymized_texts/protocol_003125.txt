Study Title  
Optimization of Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMT) Protocols 
Objectives  
Primary Aims 
I. Identify SMT protocol components and interactions that independently predict SMT 
mechanistic outcomes (spinal stiffness and multifidus activation). We hypothesize that one 
or more combination of components will be ident ified that optimize improvement in SMT 
mechanisms.   
II. Identify SMT protocol components and interactions that independently predict SMT patient-
centered outcomes (function, pain). We hypothesize that one or more combination of components will be identified that optimize im provement in patient-centered outcomes. 
Secondary Aims 
I. Explore the moderating effect of responder status after 2 SMT sessions. We hypothesize 
that responder status after 2 sessions will moderate mechanistic and patient-centered 
outcomes.  
II. Define optimized SMT protocol(s) based on combined results of the primary and secondary aims. Optimized protocols will be considered as the combination of components that maximize improvement in pat ient-centered outcomes at 3 months while 
also improving SMT mechanisms to the greatest extent. 
Design and Outcomes   
This subject will recruit adults with non-specific low back pain (LBP). We will provide 2 sessions of SMT to all subjects. We will then assess responder status and randomize subjects stratified by responder status to a treatment group for an additional 3 weeks using a factorial design to evaluate different co mbinations of intervention components (muscle 
activation exercise, spinal mobilizing exercise, additional SMT) that influence pathways 
shown to modulate the effects of SMT. Outcomes will include spinal stiffness and muscle 
activation measures as well as patient-reported outcomes assessed at baseline, and after 1 week, 4 weeks and 3 months.
 
Interventions and Duration  
All subjects will receive 2 sessions of SMT provided in the first week of participation. 
Subjects are then randomly assigned to receiv e an additional 3 weeks of treatment involving 
different combinations of exercise and/or additional SMT, or to receive no additional 
treatment. The final follow-up is conducted 3 months after enrollment. Therefore the total 
time for a subject to be “on study” is 3 months.

We will recruit a total of 316 subjects age 18-60 with non-specific LBP and an Oswestry 
Disability score of at least 20%. Following P hase I treatment, subjects will be randomized in 
equal proportions to one of 8 possible treatment combinations in Phase II. Randomization will be stratified by responder status (yes/no) during Phase I.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus 
Low back pain (LBP) is a major public health problem. An estimated 60-80% of individuals will experience an episode during their lifetime, and prevalence rates have been increasing in the past decade. Considering the prevalence of LBP, it is not surprising that the condition imposes significant economic burden on individuals, the heal thcare delivery system, and society. Total 
annual direct healthcare costs in the U.S. for LBP were estimated at $90 billion in 1998, with an 
inflation-adjusted rate of 65% over the next 7 years, a rate much higher than overall health care 
costs
. LBP is the most common symptom for which complementary and alternative medicine 
(CAM) is sought. In 2007,  18% of adult CAM users in the U.S. were seeking care for LBP, more 
than double the next most common condition. The most common CAM intervention sought by 
those with LBP is spinal manipulative therapy  (SMT). Several professions use SMT, although it is 
most often provided by chiropractors. Surveys in the U.S. suggest about half of those with chronic 
LBP have sought chiropractic care,  and LBP the reason for at least 40% of chiropractic visits. The 
Institute of Medicine identifies LBP as a top 15 priority condition, calling for the development of 
innovative, evidence-based management  strategies. In light of the prevalence of LBP and the 
frequency of SMT use for the condition, optimizi ng SMT protocols for LBP has important public 
health implications.  
2.2 Study Rationale 
Successful optimization of SMT treatment requi res understanding the mechanisms underlying the 
effects  of SMT among patients who are SMT-responders.  Past  research has identified numerous 
biologic phenomena that accompany SMT without relating these phenomena to the presence or absence of clinical benefit. In contrast, our research team has worked for more than 10 years to 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 10 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 develop and validate a model explaining the mechanisms t hat underlie the clinical effects of SMT. 
Specifically, our work supports the common clinical observation that SMT is not a broad-spectrum 
therapy, but one that preferentially benefits some individuals with  LBP (SMT-responders)  but not 
others (non-responders). This work has culminated  in the development of a validated model that 
has identified specific biomechanical signals (changes in spinal stiffness and lumbar multifidus  
muscle activation) that relate to favorable clini cal response (improved function). The clinically 
important signals we have identified (stiffness and muscle activation) are modifiable with 
interventions other than SMT; thus SMT protocols may be optimized through the use of co-interventions that modulate these signals. Our team has also developed safe, valid and reliable procedures to measure these signals, and have demonstrated successful application of both SMT treatment and signal measurement procedures in clinical populations.  
Our goal in this proposal is to optimize SMT treatment protocols for LBP. Our optimization strategy 
will evaluate SMT combined with other treatments known to modulate the same signals that underlie the clinical effects of SMT (spinal stiffness and muscle activation) using both mechanistic (stiffness, lumbar multifidus activation) and patient-centered (function and pain) outcomes. We 
have grounded our body of work in this area within the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) 
framework; which provides an efficient multi-step research strategy for optimizing multi-component interventions. In this project we will use innovative methodology to efficiently evaluate 
the effects of various individual treatment compo nents towards an overall effect; identifying which 
components are contributing to the target outcome s and which, if any, may be discarded. Results 
of this project will provide optimized SMT protocols that will be ready for application in future randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT.
   
3. STUDY DESIGN 
We will use a factorial design examining 3 int ervention components (additional SMT, mobilizing 
and multifidus activating exercise) provided in 8 different combinations following provision of 2 
SMT treatment sessions as in our prior work. We will recruit 316 subjects with non-specific LBP with the goal of enrolling 280 subjects after all eligibility screening are complete. All subjects will 
receive the 2-session SMT protocol used in our prior studies. At the third session subjects will be 
categorized as SMT responders or non-responders based on our previously-validated threshold of 50% improvement on the Oswestry (ODQ).  Randomization to subsequent treatment will be 
stratified based on responder status. This will allow us to examine the moderating effects of early clinical response. In our prior studies 35%-45% of individuals with LBP are responders to SMT 
after 2 sessions. What is unknown is the persistence of the improvement observed in early 
responders and whether or not persistence can be augmented through additional SMT and/or co-interventions working on the same causal pathways as  SMT. Likewise, it is unknown from our 
prior work if early non-responders can be converted to responders with additional SMT and/or co-interventions. Therefore, we will randomly ass ign subjects to receive 6 additional sessions (or no 
additional treatment) provided over 3 weeks with varied combinations of additional SMT and 
exercise co-interventions. We chose 6 additional  sessions based on work related to SMT dose-
response reporting only modest difference in clinical outcomes in subjects receiving 9-12 sessions 
relative to 3-6 SMT sessions without co- interventions. Outcomes including assessments of

  May 2018 mechanisms and patient-centered outcomes will be examined at baseline and after 1 week (end 
of phase  I), 4 weeks (primary outcome - end of phase II), and after 3 months (long-term outcome).  
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects in this study must satisfy all of the following eligibility criteria: 
I. Pain between the 12th rib and buttocks with or without symptoms into one or both legs, 
which, in the opinion of the examiner, originate from the lumbar region. 
II. Age 18 - 60 years 
III. Oswestry disability score > 20% 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria 
Any subject meeting any of the following exclusi on criteria at baseline will be excluded from 
participation. 
I. No prior surgery to the lumbosacral spine 
II. Not currently pregnant 
III. Not currently receiving mind-body or exercise treatment for LBP from a healthcare provider 
(e.g., chiropractic, physical therapy, massage therapy, etc.) 
IV. No neurogenic signs including any of the following: positive ipsi- or contra-lateral straight 
leg raise test (symptoms reproduced <450); reflex, sensory, or strength deficit in a pattern 
consistent with lumbar nerve root compression 
V. No “red flags” of a potentially serious condition including cauda equina syndrome, major or 
rapidly progressing neurological deficit, fracture , cancer, infection or systemic disease 
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Participants will be enrolled at two sites: the Univ ersity of Utah and University of Alberta. At the 
University of Utah we will work within the Univer sity of Utah Health Care (UUHC) family practice 
and physiatry providers to encourage direct referra l of interested individuals consulting for LBP 
into the study. We will also develop IRB-approved recruitment materials to be integrated into our 
EPIC electronic health record, allowing providers to print and provide the information to 
potentially-interested individuals. We will also work with the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Bioinformatics Core to us e the UUHC electronic data warehouse (EDW) to 
identify patients with specific characteristics based on demographic information and ICD-10 codes. These individuals are informed of the study by mail with information on procedures to opt-in or out of the study by contacting research personnel. For this project we will identify patients with a family practice visit with an ICD-10 code related to non-specific LBP (M54.5, M54.9, M51.36) between the ages of 18-60 with no record of surgery in the EDW. We will also recruit individuals with LBP who are not seeking care with flyers and ads in the community. 
At the University of Alberta we will recruit fr om clinics that have been used successfully in the 
past. These include general practice, physical therapy and chiropractic clinics within the main 
campus community. University of Alberta alre ady has IRB-approved recruitment materials that 
have been used in these clinics previously and c an be further distributed to potential participants 
through various approved electronic distribution services. We will also work with the various 
professional associations to identify patients with specific characteristics using established 
communication strategies (e.g. patient newsletters and social media postings). As is the case in Utah, potential participants informed by these means  will contact research personnel directly to 
establish eligibility and will align with ICD-10 code related to non-specific LBP (M54.5, M54.9, M51.36) between the ages of 18-60 with no record of surgery.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 12 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 Individuals interested in participation will meet the site study coordinator to insure eligibility. 
Reasons for non-enrollment will be tracked. Eligible subjects choosing to participate will sign an 
informed consent document approved by the University of Utah or Alberta IRB, after which 
baseline examination procedures and completion of all eligibility assessments will be performed by a Research Assistant who will remain blinded to the subject’s treatment group assignment throughout the study.
 Following baseline examination,  all subjects  will begin phase I treatment.  
All assessment and treatment sessions will be conducted at the Patient Wellness Center at the University of Utah  and in the Rehabilitation Robotics Sandbox at the University of Alberta.  
Treatment will be provided by clinicians licensed to provide SMT
 (DC  or PT) and trained in study-
related procedures.   
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
5.1.1  Spinal Manipulative Therapy 
The same SMT procedure will be used in phases I and II. Our past work has found equivalent outcomes regardless of SMT technique, thus we will standardize our technique consistent with our past work. This SMT technique has been applied successfully at both performance sites. All SMT sessions will begin with a brief assessment followed by SMT. The subject is supine. The 
clinician stands opposite the side to be manipulated and side-bends the subject away from the 
clinician. The side to be manipulated is the side the subject identifies as more painful. If the subject cannot identify a more painful side the clinician selects a side. The subject interlocks their fingers behind the head. The clinician rotates the subjec t, and delivers a high-velocity, low-amplitude 
(HVLA) thrust to the anterior superior iliac spine in a posterior/inferior direction. The clinician notes 
if a cavitation (ie,
 a “pop”) occurred. If it does, SMT treatment is complete. If no cavitation occurs,  
the subject is repositioned  and SMT is performed again. If no cavitation  occurs on the second 
attempt, the clinician will manipulate the opposite side. A maximum of 2 attempts per side is 
permitted. If no cavitation is noted by that time, SMT treatment is complete.  The number of SMT 
attempts will be recorded by the clinician.  Our previous research found no difference in outcome between this SMT procedure and a side-posture HVLA technique. We will permit substitution with 
side-posture HVLA if the preferred technique is not possible due to subject preference or comfort. 
In prior research we found the supine and side-posture HVLA techniques well-tolerated with no adverse events.
  
5.1.2  Multifidus Exercises 
Subjects randomized to receive multifidus exercises will begin with isometric multifidus 
contractions in different positions with clinician feedback and exercises to isometrically co-
contract the multifidus and deep abdominal muscles. These exercises have been shown to be effective for activating the multifidus. Subjects will also perform lumbar extensor strengthening exercises shown to produce 20%-50% of multifidus maximum voluntary contraction.
 This dose is 
adequate to enhance multifidus activation, without imposing high loads that may exacerbate LBP. Subjects will continue to perform isometri c exercises throughout treatment. We have applied 
these exercises in prior research with no adverse events.

Table.  Multifidus activation exercise protocol  
 
5.1.3  Mobilizing Exercises 
Subjects  randomized to  receive mobilizing exercises during phase II will be instructed in a 
program of repeated movements progressing into end-ranges of spinal flexion and/or extension 
based on principles described by McKenzie, and shown in past studies to reduce spinal stiffness. 
Subjects will be instructed in mid-range exercises and will be further assessed for a directional 
preference. A directional preference is present if movement in a particular direction decreases LBP intensity or causes symptoms to centralize towards the midline.
 Directional preference can 
be determined reliably and if present, matching the direction of mobilizing exercise to the directional preference improves outcomes. If a subj ect has a directional preference he or she will 
be prescribed exercises specifically in that di rection along with mid-range exercise.  Otherwise 
the subject will be assigned exercises moving into either flexion or extension based on the clinician’s discretion.  Subjects will perform t heir prescribed exercises following SMT at treatment 
sessions and will be instructed to perform the exercises daily on other days. We have applied these exercises in prior research with no adverse events.

5.2 Concomitant Interventions  
5.2.1 Allowed Interventions 
Interventions permitted during the study period include use of medication to control LBP 
symptoms (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, etc.) The use of various medications will be recorded at the baseline examination. Visits to health care providers for LBP are allowed during the study 
period (e.g., physician visits) as long as no interventional procedures are received (e.g., spinal 
manipulation, massage, exercise therapy, etc.) 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 14 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 5.2.2   Prohibited Interventions 
Prohibited interventions during the study peri od include any mind-body or other interventional 
procedures including spinal manipulation, massage, exercise therapy, acupuncture, spinal 
injections, surgical procedures, etc. If any prohibited events occur these will be recorded as off-protocol events. Subjects will continue to par ticipate in study-related treatments and assessments 
unless the off-protocol intervention changes the risk-benefit profile for the subject. 
5.3 Adherence Assessment  
Treatment adherence will be assessed based on a ttendance at scheduled treatment sessions 
and compliance with treatment protocols during treatment sessions. Once enrolled, a participant will have forms in REDCap for each scheduled treatment session according to the participant’s 
randomized group assignment. Treatment session forms will permit an evaluation of the number 
of scheduled sessions attended by each participant. For sessions that are attended, the treating clinician will information on the interventions provided and any reasons for non-adherence to protocols. The site study coordinator will monitor the forms at least monthly and discuss instances of non-adherence with the clinician. All off-protocol events will be recorded, such as the use of use of modalities (heat, cold, ultrasound, etc.), or application of manual therapy or exercise 
procedures not outlined in the protocol. For purposes of the data analysis per-protocol analyses we will define “adherence” as occurring when at least 80% of scheduled treatment sessions are attended. Attendance at <80% of scheduled sessions will be considered a protocol deviation.

Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 15 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 6.2 Description of Evaluations  
6.2.1 Screening Evaluation 
Individuals who contact the site Study Coordinator will be provided information about the 
study. The Study Coordinator will confirm that the individual is between age 18-60 and is not receiving other interventional or mind-body procedures for their LBP. If the individual is interested in learning more about the project a baseline assessment will be scheduled to obtain informed consent, insure all eligibility criteria are met and schedule a full assessment 
to begin the study either at that time or within 7 days of the screening evaluation. Before the 
scheduled baseline assessment, the participant may complete the Oswestry Disability survey to determine if their score is ≥  20%. If the Oswestry score is < 20%, the participant will be 
notified that they are ineligible for the study and the assessment cancelled. 
6.2.1.1   Consenting Procedure 
Interested individuals who are scheduled for a baseline assessment will begin the assessment by providing written informed consent using a form approved by the site institutional review board. The consenting process will be conducted by a research assistant who is trained by the Principal Investigator at the site and has completed 
Biomedical Research Training for Human Subjects research through the Collaborative 
Institutional Training Institute (CITI) which includes modules on human subjects research ethics and regulations related to informed c onsent. A copy of the signed informed consent 
document will be retained by the researchers.  A single consent form will be used for the 
project. The research assistant consenting the participant will sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) checklist which will be retained by the researchers. 
6.2.1.2  Screening 
Once informed consent is obtained the following screening procedures will be completed within 72 hours to insure eligibility: 
 Confirm age on the date of consent is between 18 – 60 years old. 
 Confirm that the participant is not aware that she is pregnant. 
 Confirm that the participant is not currently receiving other interventions for their LBP. 
 Confirm that the participant is experiencing LBP defined as pain between the 12th ribs 
and buttock with or without symptoms that extend into the buttock(s) or leg(s). without “red flags” suggesting a possible non-musculoskeletal cause (recent trauma, 
unexplained weight loss, night pain, systemtic illness) 
 Participant completes the Oswestry  disability index to insure the  score is >  20% 
 Research assistant conducts the physical examination to insure no signs of neurologic 
deficit are present (positive ipsi- or contra-lateral straight leg raise test (symptoms reproduced <45
0); reflex, sensory, or strength deficit in a pattern consistent with 
lumbar nerve root compression) 
6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
6.2.2.1  Enrollment 
This study uses a single informed consent document for both screening and treatment purposes. Thus the enrollment date is the date on which the consent document was signed and eligibility was confirmed. We anticipate that screening will be completed on the same day for the majority of participants because of the relatively simple and quick screening procedures required. At the latest screening will be completed within 7 days.
  
6.2.2.2  Baseline Assessments 
Assessments involve collection of both mechanistic and self-report outcomes. Self-report 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 16 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 measures will be collected via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), an NIH-
supported, browser-based, software solution that allows researchers to create secure 
online forms for data capture, management and analysis. At each assessment participants 
will input data directly into REDCap. If a participant is unable to directly input data using a computer paper forms will be available with data uploaded at a later time.  
The following assessments are collected at baseline: 
 Demographic  data  will include age, sex, race/ethnicity, employment status and general 
medical and LBP history. Current medication use for LBP will be recorded. This information 
will be used for descriptive purposes and possible covariates in analyses. 
 Physical examination will include spinal and hip range of motion and segmental mobility 
assessed with manually-applied posterior-anterior force. 
 Oswestry Disability Index (OSW): a self-re ported LBP-specific measure of function 
assessed on a 0-100 scale, with lower numbers indicating better function.  
 Numeric Pain Rating Scale: a self-reported 0-10 rating of pain intensity ranging from ‘0’ no 
pain, and ‘10’ worst imaginable pain. 
 Psychosocial Covariate Measures : will include Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire will 
be used to measure patients’ beliefs about how physical activity and work may affect their 
LBP and perceived risk for re-injury. The Pain Catastrophizing and Pain Self-Efficacy short 
forms will be used to measure the extent to which people catastrophize in  response to pain 
and their degree of confidence in the ability to function with pain respectively. These 
variables may serve as covariates in the analys es to control for psychosocial risk factors. 
 Spinal Stiffness Measures: are obtained with a mechanically-assisted indentation device 
consisting of a motorized probe in an external frame. The probe contains a compressive-tension load cell. Displacement of the probe is measured
 by a linear variable differential 
transformer. Stiffness is assessed with the subject prone.  The indentation probe is 
positioned over the L 3 spinous process. Indentation involves advancement of the probe 
from 5 N pre-load to  60 N final load maintained for  1 second. Three trials are performed 
with mean values used for analysis. Indentation data are used to calculate global stiffness  
(GS) (N) as the slope of the force displacement curve and terminal stiffness  (TS)  (N/mm)  
as the peak  applied force  and resultant displacement of underlying tissue.  
 Lumbar Multifidus Activation Measures: ar e obtained with brightness-mode ultrasound 
images. The subject is prone with neck in neutral and arms overhead at about 1200 of 
shoulder abduction. Ultrasound transducer is placed just lateral to the spinal midline and angled medially until a parasagittal view of the multifidus at the L
4-L5 and L 5-S1 levels is 
obtained. Images are acquired at each level with the multifidus at rest and during submaximal contraction elicited by lifting t he contralateral arm 2 inches while holding a 
weight proportional to body weight.
 Three images in each state are acquired and averaged.  
Muscle activation is calculated as change in thickness at rest  and submaximal  contraction. 
6.2.2.3   Randomization 
Following baseline assessment all participants will receive 2 SMT treatment sessions in the next week. Randomization to additional treatment will be done at the 1-week assessment. A randomization schedule will be developed prior to enrollment by co-investigator Dr. Greene, Director of the Study Design and Biostatistics Center
 (SDBC)  in 
the CCTS at the University of Utah. Blocked randomization with block sizes of 4 or 6 will be used. Randomization will be stratified based on site (Utah or Alberta) and responder 
status after 2 SMT sessions (based on re-assessment of the OSW) to balance these 
variables. At the 1-week assessment the study c oordinator or research assistant will look 
up the participant in the study database and open the Responder & Randomization Status  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 17 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 form in REDCap. This form will display the Os westry score from the baseline assessment 
and the calculation of score change. The percent change between baseline and 1-week 
scores determines responder status (>50% improvement  = “responder”; <50% 
improvement=  “non-responder”). Once the responder status is entered the study staff will 
select the randomize button on the screen to trigger study assignment based on the 
allocation table provided by the biostatistician, provided all of eligibility criteria are met and 
the participant has been assigned to one of the two study sites. If any of these criteria are not valid a warning message will be displayed indicating the criteria issue(s) and the 
randomization will not be completed. 
6.2.3  Blinding 
Participants cannot be  blinded to study treatments. Randomization assignment will not be 
revealed until baseline examination, the first 2 SMT sessions, and the OSW assessment are 
complete to reduce potential bias by either the subject or research assistant. Follow-up assessments will be performed by a research assistant who will be blind to participants’ treatment assignments. Participants will be reminded by the research assistant not to discuss aspects of their treatment during assessments. If a research assistant becomes unblinded during the course of a participant’s study participation, he or she will not be allowed to conduct 
additional follow-up assessments for that participant. The research assistant may participate 
in assessments for other participants for whom blinding has not been compromised. Instances of unblinding during an assessment will be recorded as an unexpected event.   
Clinicians providing treatment cannot be blinded. The use of standardized protocols for all 
treatments and clinician-compliance audits throughout the project will minimize potential bias related to differential treatment application.  
6.2.4 Follow-up Visits 
 Treatment Visits 1 and 2 (completed within the 7 days following day 0) :

Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 18 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 6.2.5 Completion/Final Evaluation  
The final evaluation occurs 3 months after Baseline ( from Day 83 – Day 97). The following 
assessments are performed at the final evaluation. If a participant wishes to terminate the study 
early, this is also the list of assessments we will attempt to complete at termination. Early 
termination will only be done at a participant’s request or if a participant’s risk-to-benefit ratio 
is substantially altered due to a change in status.  
o Physical examination 
o Self-report questionnaires 
o Spine stiffness measures 
o Multifidus activation measures 
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Expected adverse events based on our prior experience and literature reports that may occur 
with the study interventions and assessments include the following: 
o Increased back or spine pain intensity 
o Muscle soreness 
o Muscle spasms 
o Psychological distress 
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters 
Safety parameters intended to reduce risks for adverse events include having licensed clinicians 
specifically trained in the study procedures ca rry out all treatments. The spinal stiffness 
measurement procedure may be stopped at any time by the participant using a hand held switch. 
The potential risk of psychological distress from answering self-report questions about the impact of the individual’s LBP on various aspects of his or her life will be minimized by telling participants that they are not required to answer any questions that are distressing. 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing,  Recording and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters 
The risk profile of the interventions in this study is minimal. Treatment procedures in the study are standard procedures used in everyday clinical practice and the measurement procedures have 
been applied by this research team in several preliminary studies.
1,2 The use of manipulation for 
patients with acute LBP is supported by clinical practice guidelines in the United States3 and 
elsewhere, and is not associated with a high risk of serious side effects.4 Ultrasound measurement 
procedures are similar to those used during pregnancy, using low intensity ultrasound waves 
spread over a large area which causes very minimal heating that is mostly undetectable to the 
subject. The spinal stiffness measurement procedure uses a 60 N force to assess spinal stiffness. 
We have tested several hundred subjects with this procedure with no adverse events.2

7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will solicited at each assessment (1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months). If an adverse 
event is identified unsolicited during a treatment session or other contact with research personnel, 
the event will be recorded and reported as outlined below. 
 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical o ccurrence in a subject during participation in the 
clinical study or with use of the experimental agent being studied. An adverse finding can include 
a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment (laboratory test value, vital signs, electrocardiogram finding, etc.), or any combination of these regardless of relationship to participation in the study. 
Unanticipated Problems (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
all of the following criteria: 
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that 
are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, exper ience, or outcome may have been caused by 
the procedures involved in the research); and 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social har m) than was previously known or recognized. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that m eets one or more of the following criteria: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (places subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) 
 Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   
7.4 Reporting Procedures 
The site PI at the University of Alberta must immediately report to the University of Utah PI any 
serious adverse event, whether or not consider ed study related, and must include an assessment 
of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study caused the event within 72 hours of PI awareness of the event. The site PI for the University of Alberta must also report any unanticipated problems within the same timeframe. The Site PI must also report any other adverse events within 7 days of PI awareness. Participating centers must submit all reports to their local IRB other entities using the following timeline:   
 Unanticipated problems that are serious adv erse events will be reported to the IRB, DSM 
committee and NCCIH within 3 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 20 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018  
 Other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB, DSM committee, and NCCIH 
within 7 days of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
Should an unanticipated problem need to be reported to the IRB it will be reported to the IRB of 
both the University of Utah and University of Alberta. A record of all reportable unanticipated problems will be maintained at the coordinating site and reported during annual DSM reports. In addition, researchers will record at each study visit the occurrence of any other adverse events (e.g., visiting the emergency room or medical provider for pain exacerbation, etc.) A report of all 
adverse events will be maintained by each site and reported annually on the DSM report.  
Characteristics of an Adverse Event 
Relationship to Study Intervention 
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used: 
1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite) 
a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention. 
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. 
c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued. 
d. The event reappears upon a re-challenge with the intervention. 
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related) 
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. b. An alternate etiology has been established. 
Expectedness of SAEs 
The Study PI and investigators will be responsible for determining whether an SAE is 
expected or unexpected.  An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, 
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the intervention.   
Severity of Event 
The following scale will be used to grade adverse events: 
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL) 
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on ADL 
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical attention, needs major assistance with ADL 
7.5 Followup for Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
7.6 Safety Monitoring  
The scope and the purpose of this study qualifies as a Phase III clinical trial, therefore a data and safety monitoring (DSM) board will be established based on the NIH guidelines and NCCIH 
input, and commensurate with the level of risk, size, and complexity of this study.   
 
Composition of the DSM:  The DSM Board will be composed of three individuals with expertise 
in disciplines relevant to the conduct of this  study who are not involved in the study, and have 
no conflict of interest or economic interest in the results of the study. 
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 21 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018  
Frequency and Character of DSM Meetings:  Because this study involves procedures with 
minimal risk, we propose to conduct DSM meetings via conference call on an annual basis. 
Each DSM meeting will begin with an open session that will be attended by all trial Investigators, Study Coordinators and representatives from  the NCCIH Program Office. Open session will 
review study procedures, plans for data and safe ty monitoring, recruitment and retention, 
gender and minority inclusion, protocol adherence, data management, the occurrence of any adverse events. The open session will be followed by a closed session that will be attended by 
only the DSMB members and NCCIH representative s. The closed session will be used to 
discuss data to which the other Investigators must remain blinded.  
 
Content of DSMB Meeting Reports:  DSM report from each meeting will review the topics 
discussed at the meeting with respect to study procedures, accrual and retention, data management, etc. The DSM report will include a recommendation concerning continuation of 
the study. Each DSM report will provide a tally of  all adverse events in each of the categories 
listed above in all treatment groups.  Blinding of  adverse event results will be maintained and 
will be broken only if the DSMB indicates a need to un-blind groups for serious safety reasons. DSMB reports will be submitted to the Principal  Investigator, the NCCIH Program Office, and 
the University of Utah ad University of Alberta Institutional Review Boards. 
8.   INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  
The investigators will only discont inue a participant’s interventi on if the risk-benefit ratio 
for that participant changes substantially such that th ey would no longer meet the 
project’s eligibility criteria . Examples include development  of signs consistent with 
neurologic deficits or presentation of “red flag” symptom s. These circumstances will be 
identified by research personnel  during study visits for treat ment or assessments. If a 
participant is discontinued, we will conti nue to collect the self-report outcomes only. 
9.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
This study uses a factorial design examini ng 3 intervention components (additional SMT, 
mobilizing and multifidus activating exercise) provided in 8 different combinations following provision of 2 SMT treatment sessions. All parti cipants will receive 2 SMT sessions. At the third 
session participants will be categorized as responders or non-responders based on a threshold of 50% improvement on the OSW.  Randomization to subsequent treatment is stratified by 
responder status. We will randomly assign participants to receive 6 additional sessions (or no additional treatment) over 3 weeks with varied combinations of additional SMT and exercise co-interventions. It is important to distinguish the factorial design from an 8-arm trial. The factorial 
approach evaluates the main effects of the 3 additional intervention components (additional 
SMT, mobilizing and multifidus activating exercise) and interactions among components. It does not compare 8 distinct treatment arms and thus is more efficient with a smaller sample size relative to an 8-arm randomized trial. 
Our primary hypothesis is that one or more co mbination of treatment components will optimize 
improvement in SMT mechanistic effects (reduct ion in spinal stiffness and improvement in 
multifidus activation) as well as improvement in patient-centered outcomes (LBP-related 
disability and pain intensity). Our secondary hypothesis is that responder status after 2 sessions will moderate the mechanistic and patient-centered outcomes. Our work and the work of others has demonstrated that these mechanistic and patient-reported outcomes are valid and can be collected reliably.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 22 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 9.2 Sample Size and Randomization 
Based on our past trials, we project 95% retention at 4-weeks. We estimated standard deviations 
of each outcome based on patients in a similar project with analogous eligibility criteria, and conservatively estimated pre-post correlations to be 4%-7% smaller than the values in this study. Assuming a sample size of 316, of which 280 meet all eligibility criteria and 92% of enrolled participants are retained to 4 weeks, the table below displays minimum detectable effect sizes for a) main effects of each protocol component, b) pairwise interactions between components, c) 
comparison of mean outcome between two levels of one component at a fixed level of another 
component, d) main effects of the 3 components in subgroup analyses involving half the participants, and e) pairwise interactions between 2 components in subgroup analyses with half the participants. This sample size provides at least 80% power to detect the MCID or hypothesized effect sizes for the main effects of each component for all outcomes,
 and for analyses  of main 
effects  in subgroups and  conditional comparisons for each outcome except global stiffness. 
Power is more limited for secondary aims, such as pairwise interactions within subgroups.

  Interaction in 50% of subjects 1.05 0.091 11.65 2.16 
Table.   Assumptions and detectable effect sizes informin g sample size for the pro ject. 
 
Because the analyses of the longitudinal models will be based on restricted maximum likelihood estimation, statistical inferences will remain valid so long as missing data follow a missing at 
random structure, and based on our past work we expect little missing data at the 4 week 
assessment. Thus we do not believe missing data will lead to substantial bias in our primary evaluation of protocol components. However, we  will compare subject characteristics between 
subgroups with missing and nonmissing data at 4 weeks and if substantial deviations are detected, or the rate of missing data is greater than expected, multiple imputation will be applied 
using comprehensive imputation models which include auxiliary variables to account for additional predictors of missingness and/or the values of the outcome variables.
 
 
9.2.1   Treatment Assignment Procedures 
A randomization schedule will be developed prior to enrollment by Dr. Greene, Director of the 
Study Design and Biostatistics Center  at the University of Utah. Blocked randomization with block 
sizes of 4 or 6 will be used. Randomization will be stratified based on site (Utah or Alberta) and 
responder status after 2 SMT sessions to balance these variables. Sequentially-numbered, sealed envelopes will be prepared containing treatment group assignments. The randomization envelope will be opened by the site Study Coordinator after completion of all baseline procedures 
and the 2 SMT sessions. 
Subjects cannot be
 blinded to study treatments. Because our purpose is to optimize protocols, 
not to evaluate the SMT efficacy, we will not use placebos or attempt to balance clinician time. 
Randomization assignment will not be revealed unt il baseline examination, the first 2 SMT  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 23 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 sessions, and the OSW assessment are complete to reduce potential bias by either the subject 
or research assistant. Follow-up assessments will be performed by a Research Assistant who will 
be blind to subjects’ treatment assignments. Clin icians providing treatment cannot be blinded. 
The use of standardized protocols for all treatments and clinician-compliance audits throughout 
the project will minimize potential bias related to differential treatment application. The PI at each site will be able to break the blinding if neces sary for participant safety considerations. 
9.3  Definition of Populations 
Intention-to-treat principles will be used with all participants analyzed in their randomized group regardless of compliance. We will compare compliance between groups and “per-protocol” secondary analyses may be considered if non-compliance is high or disproportionate between 
groups. A compliant treatment episode will be defined as receiving at least 80% of study sessions 
based on randomized group. 
9.4 Interim Analyses and Stopping Rules 
Because of the minimal risk of the procedures in this study we have not proposed any stopping rules. We have not defined any procedures for interim analyses to avoid the risk of inflating Type 
I error. We will monitor the occurrence of adverse events throughout the study. If the number of 
serious adverse events warrants, we will suspend enrollment and review the safety of the study 
procedures under the direction of the DSM board and NCCIH representatives. 
9.5 Outcomes  
Outcome measure for the primary and secondary hypotheses of the study are outlined below. These outcomes will not require any adjudication. 
9.5.1 Primary and Secondary Outcomes   
The outcomes used to address the primary and secondary hypotheses of this project are each 
collected at baseline, 1-week, 4-week and 3-month assessments.   
Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (OSW): The OSW is a LBP-specific measure of function for 
patients with LBP assessed on a 0-100 scale, with lower numbers indicating better function. Our past research has found the ODQ to have high test-retest reliability (ICC
 = 0.90), good construct 
validity, and responsiveness to change for patients with LBP, with a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 6 points.   
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): A 0-10 NPRS (‘0’ no pain, and ‘10’ worst imaginable pain) 
will be used to assess LBP intensity.  The NPRS has excellent test-retest reliability. Our previous research has found the NPRS to be responsive to change with an MCID of 2 points for acute LBP.   
Spinal Stiffness : Spine
 stiffness will be assessed with a mechanically-assisted indentation device 
developed by Dr. Kawchuk and used in our previous research. The device consists of a motorized indentation probe supported by an external frame. The probe contains a compressive-tension load cell
 (Entran,  Fairfield,  NJ) connected in-series with the probe. Displacement of the probe is 
measured  by a linear variable differential transformer  (Honeywell  International Inc.,  Morristown,  
NJ) attached between the probe and its external  housing. Signals from the load cell and 
transformer are collected by customized LABview software (National Instruments, Austin, TX) at a collection rate of 200 Hz.  
Spinal stiffness is assessed with the subject prone on a table with arms at the side and a neutral neck position.
  The examiner manually identifies and marks the L 3 spinous process, and positions 
the indentation probe over it.  The subject is instructed to inhale and exhale comfortably, and hold their breath at the end of exhalation during indentation, which lasts about 5 seconds. Indentation involves advancement of the probe from
 a 5 N pre-load to  60 N final load maintained for  1 second,  
then the  probe raises  automatically. Three indentation trials are performed with mean values used 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 24 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 for analysis. Indentation data (force and displacement) are used to calculate stiffness variables.  
Global stiffness  (GS) (N) is calculated as the slope of the force displacement curve between 5  - 
60 N, representing stiffness of underlying tissues during indentation. Terminal stiffness  (TS)  
(N/mm)  represents peak  applied force  and resultant displacement of underlying tissues. We have 
found excellent  within-  and between-day reliability of stiff ness measures made with this device 
(ICC  = 0.98-0.99). A safety switch is provided to the subject and assessor that raises the 
indentation probe immediately if pressed, providing additional safety features.  
Lumbar Multifidus Muscle Activation:  Multifidus activation will be measured with brightness-mode 
ultrasound images using a 60mm, 2-5 MHz curvilinear array. We have previously reported  
excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability for these measurs. The subject is prone with neck in 
neutral and arms overhead at about 1200 of shoulder abduction. The ultrasound transducer is 
placed just lateral to the spinal midline and angled medially until a parasagittal view of the multifidus at the L
4-L5 and L 5-S1 levels is obtained.   Images are acquired at each level with the 
multifidus at rest and during submaximal contracti on elicited by the subject lifting the contralateral 
arm about 2 inches while holding a weight proportional to body weight.  Images are acquired at 
the end of exhalation to minimize effects of respiration.  Three images in each state are acquired 
and averaged.  Images are stored and measured offline by a blinded rater using NIH (Bethesda,  
MD) Image J software (V1 .38t). Offline  multifidus thickness measures are obtained from 
determining the distance between the posterior-most aspect of the facet joint inferiorly  and the 
plane  between  the multifidus  and thoracolumbar  fascia superior. Activation is calculated as the 
change in thickness from rest  to submaximal  contraction  (Thickness contract –Thickness rest)  / 
Thickness rest). Research has shown these measures of multifidus activation have good concurrent 
validity compared to EMG activity of the muscle.  
9.6 Data Analyses  
Primary Aim 1 : Spine  stiffness  and multifidus activation  will be  co-primary  outcomes for evaluating 
effects of SMT protocol components on SMT mechanisms. The effect of intervention components 
(A additional SMT; B multifidus activation; C mobilizing exercises) on each outcome will be 
evaluated using linear mixed models to relate mean levels of each outcome at 1-, 4-weeks and 
3-months to indicator variables to represent the main effects of each interventions  (A, B, C) as 
well as each pairwise interaction between the interventions (A  x B, A  x C, B  x C) and the 3-way 
interaction  (A  x B  x C). 1-week assessment, which occurs just before randomization, will serve as 
the baseline for these analyses and the model will be assumed equal between the randomized groups. This model, sometimes referred to as a constrained longitudinal model,
 leads to 
adjustment for baseline levels as in analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), which has been shown to 
remove conditional bias in treatment group co mparisons due to chance imbalances and improve 
statistical power over unadjusted comparisons. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to account for correlation of serially measured outcome scores in the same subject. By using an 
unstructured covariance matrix, the model will constitute a special case of a general linear mixed 
model which avoids imposing specific assumptions concerning distribution of random effects. This modelling approach is recommended in randomized trials when the number of follow-up outcome assessments is small. Restricted maximum likelihood estimation will be used for estimation of parameters and their associated standard errors. 
 
Linear mixed effects analysis will provide estimates and CIs for the following quantities for each  
outcome  at both 4-week  and 3-month assessments: a)  Main effects evaluating effects of each of 
the 3 interventions while averaging over the levels of the other 2 interventions. b)  Three pairwise 
interactions  evaluating  if the  effect of  an intervention  differs between  levels  of another  
interventions, while averaging over levels of the 3rd intervention. Pairwise interactions will inform 
whether  the effects  of each intervention pair  are additive,  synergistic  or antagonistic. c)  3-way 
interaction evaluating if each pairwise interaction differs depending on the 3rd intervention. 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 25 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 Adjusted means with CIs will be provided for each treatment combination. Interaction plots will be 
used to depict significant interactions and linear contrasts constructed to evaluate the effect of 
each intervention conditional on the presence or absence of the other intervention. To account 
for 2 primary outcomes, each of the hypothesis tests noted above will be performed with 2-sided 
α=0.025 and confidence intervals will be constructed using a confidence coefficient of 0.975. The 
indicated comparisons at 4-weeks will be given prim ary emphasis in evaluating the effects of each 
intervention. Comparisons at 3-months will evaluate  persistence of effects following intervention.  
Primary  Aim #2: The OSW and NPRS will be co-primary outcomes for evaluating the effects of 
the 3 SMT protocol components on patient centered outcomes. The same analytic approach described above will be used. To account for 2 outcomes, we will again apply a 2-sided α=0.05 
and 97.5% CIs for statistical inference. 
Secondary Aim #1: It is unknown how early SMT response may affect response to additional 
intervention. We will examine this question by evaluating responder status after 1 week as a 
possible effect moderator by adding a main effect for responder status and interaction terms 
between responder status and the indicator variables for treatments (and treatment combinations) which are retrained in the final simplified models for the different outcomes developed using the BIC criteria for each of the co-primary outcomes for the primary aims 1 and 2. Statistically significant interactions between responder status and main effect and/or interaction terms 
between treatment intervention components will be interpreted as suggesting effect moderation. 
Recognizing that tests for interactions have limited statistical power, we will also fit the simplified models developed in Aims 1 and 2 separately under the presence and absence of each factor (dichotomizing using a median split for continuous factors), and graphically display the estimated treatment effects at both levels of responder status. Recognizing the potential for lower statistical power, the results of Secondary Aim #1 will be interpreted as exploratory.   
Secondary Aim #2: In order to assess which intervention component combinations provide 
optimal outcomes, we will first simplify the fully saturated factorial analysis of variance model by 
comparing the Bayes Information Criterion (B IC) among all possible models including different 
combinations of main effects, pairwise interactions and the 3-way interaction which satisfy the hierarchical consistency constraint that the main effects corresponding to each term in a pairwise 
interaction are retained in models with pairwise interactions, and all component main effects and 
pairwise interactions are retained when considering the 3-way interaction. This will result in a more parsimonious model to increase statistical power. Then, using the simplified model, for each 
outcome we will use a simulation
 approach  to derive simultaneous 97.5%  CIs for all comparisons  
of estimated mean outcome under each possible treatment combinations (No further treatment, A, B, C, A
 x B, A  x C, B  x C, A  x B x C). After ordering the treatment combinations in accordance with 
the observed mean outcome, the simultaneous CIs will be used to identify which combinations are statistically indistinguishable from the optimum treatment, thus identifying a set of candidate options for the best combination of treatments. This process will be applied for both mechanistic and patient-centered outcomes. We anticipate that more than one combination will be considered optimal for different outcomes, and that the combinations that are optimal will differ for different 
outcome measures. Our interpretation of optimiz ed protocols will give preference to longer term 
outcomes (ie, 3-month scores) and patient-centered outcomes. We will also consider an 
application of the robust modelling approach to derive a model for the optimum combination of components as a multivariate function which jointly incorporates each the potential effect modification of week 1 responder status in the same model. This approach will estimate the combination of components providing the optimum expected outcome for each participant based 
on their responder status after 1 week.

10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Participant-reported measures will be collected via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), 
an NIH-supported, browser-based, software solution that allows researchers to create secure online forms for data capture, management and analysis. At each assessment participants will input data directly into REDCap. If a participant is unable to directly input data, paper forms will 
be available with data uploaded at a later time. Self-report data will be downloaded from REDCap 
and integrated with mechanistic and physical examination data by the SDBC at the University of Utah. A research assistant blinded to the participant’s randomly-assigned treatment group will conduct the assessments to avoid bias. Confidentiality of participant’s records will be protected by storing all electronic information on encrypted, password-protected computers. 
The database for this study will be kept on a server  supplied by the University of Utah Health 
Sciences Center (UUHSC). The UUHSC utilizes tec hnology from Hitachi Data Systems called the 
Universal Storage Platform for providing a virtualized storage area network. This network is maintained on a server by the University of  Utah Health Sciences Information Technology 
Support. All programming for the analyses will also be stored on the same server and coordinated through the University of Utah SDBC. 
Source documents not stored elec tronically will be maintained in locked cabinets within the 
personal offices of the PI and study coordi
nator at each site.  
10.2 Data Management  
Each subject enrolled in the study will receive a site-specific unique Patient Identifier that will be 
generated prior to beginning the study. Once a subject provides informed consent to participate 
in the study, the Study Coordinator will create a new Patient Profile in REDCap. The Patient Profile will be identified by the unique Patient Identifier, and will not contain the patient’s name, Social Security number, or any other type of Pers onal Health Information data that could be used 
to identify the individual patient. The link between the Patient Identifier and the subject’s Personal 
Health Information will be maintained by the Investigators, and will be available only to the Study 
Coordinators and Investigators. After the Patient Profile is created, the subject will be able to input all self-report data directly into REDCap using a computer or laptop using a web-based interface. All
 data entered by the subject into REDCap  is identified only by  the unique Patient Identifier. For 
participants who are unable to complete online data forms, paper forms will be provided. 
 
All self-report subject data will be collected using the REDCap data collection platform. Additional 
subject information (e.g., informed consent documents, demographic and physical examination 
forms completed by the Research Assistant ) will be entered into REDCap by the Study 
Coordinator or Research Assistant as appropriate. The University of Utah Study Design and 
Biostatistics Center (SDBC) at the University of  Utah Center for Clinical and Translational Science 
(CCTS) will download study data monthly once enrollm ent begins. This information will not include 
any patient identifying information.  
10.3 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1 Training 
Project investigators will conduct training sessions for all research assistants and clinicians who will provide interventions. The University of Utah will train 4 clinicians in the provision of study-
related treatments. The University of Alberta will trai n 2 clinicians. Training will consist of written  
instructions for the performance of study-related techniques and hands-on practice. Both 
investigators are experienced in training clinicia ns to successfully perform treatment procedures, 
and researcher personnel in collection of human subjects data.  All personnel will be trained for 
their role in the project before enrollment begins. During the first 3 months of the study, prior to 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 27 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 beginning data collection, a detailed Study Protocol will be compiled under the supervision of the 
Dr. Fritz with input from all investigators. The Protocol will be approved by the DSM prior to 
recruitment. All study personnel will review and familiarize themselves  with the Study Protocol in 
detail prior to participation. 
The Principal Investigators will conduct training sessions based on the Study Protocol for 
clinicians and research personnel during the first 3 months of the study. All research staff and clinicians will receive instruction in administrative aspects of the study (informed consent, subject recruitment, data and safety monitoring and subject confidentiality issues, etc.).
 Clinicians will 
receive additional training in all study -related treatment procedures previously described. Training 
goals will be accomplished by providing theoretical and practical information related to this project 
and the procedures employed. Management strategies based on group assignment will be highlighted with case examples. All clinicians and research personnel must complete training before participating in any study-related procedures. A training log will record successful completion of training activities. 
10.3.2 Monitoring 
All protocol deviations and adverse events will be recorded at both sites as previously outlined. 
Deviations or adverse events will be reported in a timely manner to the PI and to the IRBs of the 
participating institutions as required. Annually, a report will be compiled for review by the DSM and NCCIH representatives. The DSM may reques t more frequent reviews if necessary. 
11. PARTICIPANT RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
11.1 Institutional Review  Board (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent documents from each study site (Appendix I) and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by the IRB or ethics committee responsible for oversight of the study.  
11.2 Informed Consent Forms 
A signed consent form will be obtained from each participant. For participants who cannot consent for themselves, such as those with a legal guardian (e.g., person with power of attorney), this individual must sign the consent form. The consent form describes the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. A copy will be given to each 
participant or legal guardian and this fact will be documented in the participant’s study record.  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Participant confidentiality will be protected in the data collection process. All personnel involved with the research at both sites responsible for collecting and handling the data will have completed the Collaborative Institutional Training Institute (CITI) modules for Human Subjects Research and Responsible Conduct of Research. Approval has been obtained by the respective Institutional Review Boards. Consent forms that identify the patient by name will be stored in a locked cabinet 
by the site Investigator. All data are assigned a unique identifier (not containing PHI) to identify 
each participant. Participants will be instructed not to identify themselves by name on any instrument. The data file linking names and code numbers will be accessible only to the site PI or Coordinator, and data will be entered into study databases by this unique identifier. If data are used in scholarly presentations or journal articles , the investigators will protect the anonymity of  
 
individual participants and will report only aggregate data where appropriate. No audio or video 
taping will be conducted as part of this study. Information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as necessary  for monitoring by IRBs, NCCIH, and the OHRP.

Consent Information (EICI) on 
Residual Newborn Specimen

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
APPROVAL DATE: 3/6/2018  
Hospital  EICI intervention protocol  
3/6/2018  
 
Run-in Phase  
We will conduct a “run -in” of the EICI in each  of the participating ho spitals with 10 women and 
then will conduct a follow up interview with all of these participants.  
 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criterion  
 
Inclusion criteria for the intervention  include: adult ( > 18 years) English  speaking women who 
are already being approached for participation in the BioTrust.    
 
Exclusion criteria include mothers of infants that are in the NICU  and any situation adoption or 
legal guardianship is unknown  at the time of birth . 
 
Recruitment  
Our research procedures are designed to mirror the current practice at the individual hospoitals 
as much as possible. Typically, nurses discuss the BioTrust inf ormational brochure shortly after 
moving into the Mother & Baby unit as part of the packet of information related to their stay in the unit. Once the baby is 24 hours old, the nursery tech comes to complete newborn screening 
and asks for BioTrust consent at that time.    
 
Our approach will use a full time research assistant (RA) at each hospital. All potential 
participants will receive the brochure as part of standard practice during their welcome to the Mother & Baby Unit. At some point after admission to the Unit , the RA will approach the 
patient, briefly describe the study and content of data collected, and seek verbal consent for participation in the study. If they consent, the RA will activate the study -provided electronic 
tablet to see the study group assignment; study staff and healthcare providers will be blind to 
the study group assignment until this point. P articipants  will be randomized into the video 
intervention group (Group A), interactive intervention group (Group B), or standard of care 
group (Group C). The patient will then complete the intervention (Groups A and B) or continue 
the BioTrust discussion with the nu rse (Group C).  
 
Intervention  Groups A and B  
Following randomization, participants in Groups A or B will be given the  electronic table t with 
the intervention loaded on the screen  and  provided with instructions . In order to allow 
particpants as much time as necessary to explore the app, the RA will leave the room while the patient is working on the tablet and return within an hour  to pick up the table t.  Participants in 
Group A will be asked to watch a 6 -minute vi deo about what it means to consent to have th e 
NBS bloodspots retained by the Michigan BioTrust. Participants in Group B will be provided with the same information in an interactive app form, and will be asked to explore the 
informational sections at their preferred level of depth. After the video en ds or participants 
reach the end point of the educational app, they will automatically be directed to complete the 
associated questionnaires. When t he RA returns, she will collect the tablet and provide the 
participant with a $25 gift card to Amazon. The n ext day, the Nursery Tech  will  visit the 
patient’s room to gather NBS bloodspots and consent for the BioTrust, following the  standard 
consent process .  
 
 
Control Group C  
 
Participan ts who are randomized to Group C  will complete the questionnaires immediately 
following the BioTrust discussion with the nurse. The RA will stay in the room while the 
surveys are being completed then provide the participant with a $25 gift card to Amazon . The 
next day, the Nursery Tech will vi sit the patient’s room to gather NBS bloodspots and consent 
for the BioTrust, following the standard consent process . The RA will review collected consent 
cards to document the patient’s choice to consent or deny.  
 
Survey Tools  
All participating women wil l complete a survey 1) immediately following the 
intervention/control on the electronic tablet and 2) by telephone 2 -4 weeks follow up.  
Participants will receive an additional $25 gift card to Amazon after the follow -up survey. 
Outcome measures include:  
 knowledge of the elements of consent and key aspects of the biobank  
 decisional conflict  
 satisfaction with the consent process and attitudes toward the clinical program the 
samples were collected for and research  with these samples  
 rates of parental permis sion 
We will also collect demographic information on the participants and contact information for 
contact by telephone 2 -4 weeks later. All identifying information will be kept in a secure data 
storage system separate from data used for analyses.  
 
 
Partne rs 
Research indicates that the partners of pregnant women are typically not approached  for consent 
for the retention of specimens in the biorepository.24 Our Process Observations revealed that 
fathers were in the room during the consent process in roughly half of the cases and were vocal 
and i nvolved in the process in two thirds of thos e situations. Therefore we will not attempt to 
recruit those who are in the hospital although partners will be welcomed to participate in the 
intervention if they are present. The role of partners may be importan t in decision -making 
about biobanking whether or not they are typically approached. All participants will be asked 
in the 2- 4 week follow -up survey about the role of their partner in decision -making about 
specimen biobanking. Additionally, whoever complete d the survey in the hospital will be the 
same person to complete the 2 -4 week survey, regardless of status as birth mother or partner.  
 
Clinical Site Coordination  
Drs. Rothwell , Botkin  and Johnson  along with Ms. Langbo from the Michigan Department of 
Health will provide guidance for the coo rdination of the clinical sites . Drs . Botkin and Rothwell 
will visit each site prior to implementation of data collection to introduce the project to staff and 
discuss issues sites may have. To ensure success, there will be at least weekly meetings with all 
three  site RA  and the Research  Director, Dr. Johnson. RAs  will provide weekly reports of 
activities and recruitment. In addition, we will hold monthly telecon ference with the research 
team and the Site PIs to discuss any larger issues and potential adverse events.  Consistency 
among the sites will be monitored with these reports and communication strategies. Research 
team coordination with communication and mee tings is based on the successful 
accomplishment of previous research project (R01 HD058854).  
 
Analysis Plan  
Summary statistics for baseline demographics (age, ethnicity, race, income, etc.) will be 
calculated and reported for each intervention group (App or Video) versus Control. We will 
utilize multilevel generalized mixed modeling (via SPSS and R) under an intent -to-treat (ITT) 
approach to compare primary, secondary outcomes, and exploratory outcomes.  
 
Hypothesis Testing: To evaluate the fixed effect of  the two different groups upon knowledge 
we will utilize a single level model that includes the fixed effect of group (G).    
 
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖=[𝛾𝛾0+𝛾𝛾1𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖]+[𝜁𝜁𝑖𝑖+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖] 
 
where Y is the composite score for knowledge. G  is an indicator for the different groups (App 
or Video , Control). We will set alpha = 0.05. The two group model reduces to a 2 sided, t- test 
approach.

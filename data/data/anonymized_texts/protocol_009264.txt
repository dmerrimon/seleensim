Introduction and  Background Information
You/Your child  (referred to as you in the rest of this document) are invited to take part in a research 
study because you have been diagnosed with asthma and have not been on inhaled medication for at 
least the past four weeks. The study is being conducted under the direction of Scott Bickel, MD, and 
Nemr Eid, MD, at the University of Louisville.  About 50 local subjects will be invited to take part in 
this research. 
Purpose
The purpose  of this study is to see how Flunisolide HFA (an FDA approved inhaled medication to 
treat asthma) affects the lungs in asthma, especially the small airways deeper in the lungs as 
measured by tests that are commonly used in the day-to-day care of patients with asthma.
Procedures
To participate  in this study, you must meet certain criteria that will be evaluated and determined by 
the study doctor and/or study staff.  Your medical history and current medical condition will be 
reviewed.  You will be asked for personal information, such as your date of birth and race/ethnicity. 
The study doctor in charge of this study or a member of the study doctor’s staff will discuss with you 
all requirements for participation in this study.
Your participation  in this study will last for up to 14 weeks.  If you consent to participate, you will have 
the following procedures while you are in this study.   UofL Institutional Review Boards

2/1/2017 Page  2 of 10Visit 1:  (1 hour)
At this  visit you can expect us to do the following:
Ask you  to review and sign this informed consent and HIPAA document
Obtain  your past medical history and any medications you have taken in the past 4 weeks or 
are currently taking
Ask you  to fill out a simple questionnaire to help show how well your asthma has been 
controlled.
Measure  oxygen saturation on room air
Perform  a physical exam (weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, etc)
Collect  urine to preform a pregnancy test if you are a female who could be pregnant
Require  that you have the following procedures:
oSpirometry   - a breathing test where you will be asked to take a very deep breath and 
blow out as hard and quick as you can into a mouthpiece connected to a computer
oImpulse  oscillometry - a test where you will be asked to sit up straight and breathe 
normally for about 30 seconds while you have a mouthpiece in place.  You will hear a 
quiet “ticking” sound during the procedure but it is painless and does not require 
significant effort.  
This visit  will determine if you are eligible to be enrolled in the study.  If you meet the study criteria, 
we will ask you to continue in the study and schedule a second visit.
Visit 2:  (1 hour; 1 to 56 days after visit 1))
At this  visit you can expect us to do the following:
Ask you  to fill out a simple questionnaire to help show how well your asthma has been 
controlled
Review  your health status/medical history
Review  any medications you are taking
Obtain  vital signs (heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate and blood pressure)
Measure  your oxygen saturation on room air
Measure  your height and weight
Perform  a short physical exam
Perform  pre-bronchodilator impulse oscillometry
Perform  pre-bronchodilator spirometry
Receive  bronchodilator (albuterol, 4 puffs via spacer, or ProAir if you are currently using it)
Perform  post-bronchodilator impulse oscillometry
Perform  post-bronchodilator spirometry
Randomly assign  you (a process like flipping a coin) to a one of two doses of flunisolide (either 
80 mcg 1 puff twice a day or 80 mcg 2 puffs twice a day)
Provide  you with flunisolide and teach you how to use the study drug device, per 
manufacturer’s instructions
Provide  you with albuterol sulfate for breakthrough symptoms.

There may also  be other procedures required as part of the study.  The risks associated with Impulse 
oscillometry and spirometry include becoming short of breath when asked to inhale and exhale 
deeply and quickly.  
In addition,  you may suffer harms that we have not seen before. 
Possible Pregnancy  Risks 
You should  discuss pregnancy risks with your doctor before signing this consent form. Women who 
are pregnant or breast feeding may not participate in this research study.  If you are pregnant or 
become pregnant, your unborn child may suffer harms that we have not seen before. If you (or your 
partner) become pregnant while in this study, the sponsor may ask to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy.  If you agree to allow the study doctor to follow your pregnancy, you will be asked to read 
and sign a separate consent form for permission to follow the outcome of your pregnancy.  
If you are  a man taking part in the study and your partner becomes pregnant, the study doctor may 
ask you to ask your partner for permission to follow her pregnancy.  If she agrees, she will be asked 
to sign a separate consent form mentioned above.
Before starting  this research study, females able to have children will have a pregnancy test.  Talk to 
your doctor about the best method of birth control to use while you are in this study.  It is important 
that you call your study doctor at 502-588-4940 right away if you become pregnant or father a child 
during the course of this study.  If you or your partner becomes pregnant, a decision may have to be 
made whether or not to end the pregnancy.  
We do  not know the effects of flunisolide on an unborn baby.  There is a risk that your unborn baby 
could be harmed if you become pregnant during your participation in the study.  (If you ask, your 
study doctor will discuss the possible risks to your unborn child and your options should you become 
pregnant while in this study.)UofL Institutional Review Boards

The possible  benefits of this study include improving your asthma control and having access to an 
inhaler device that may be easier to use than others (as it does not require a separate spacer).
Alternatives
Instead of taking  part in this study, you could choose to not to participate in this study. You can 
discuss other medications and/or methods with your doctor to bring your asthma symptoms under 
control.
Research Related Injury  
If you are  injured by being in this research study, the study doctor will arrange for you to get medical 
treatment. The sponsor will pay for any reasonable medical costs related to the treatment of your 
injury. If you are injured, there is no money set aside for lost wages, discomfort, disability, etc. You do 
not give up your legal rights by signing this form. If you think you have a research related injury, 
please call your study doctor, Dr. Bickel at 502-588-4940.
Compensation
You will  be paid $50 by Visa gift card for your time, inconvenience, or expenses while you are in this 
study. Because you will be paid to be in this study the University of Louisville may collect your name, 
address, social security number, and keep records of how much you are paid.  You may or may not 
be sent a Form 1099 by the University.  This will only happen if you are paid $600 or more in one 
year by the University. This will not include payments you may receive as reimbursement, for 
example mileage reimbursement. We are required by the Internal Revenue Service to collect this 
information and you may need to report the payment as income on your taxes.  
Costs
You will  not be billed for the following office visits, tests, medications, and procedures that are done 
for this research study that are done for the research study: Flunisolide HFA, spirometry and impulse 
oscillometry.  The charges for these items will be paid for by the Sponsor.  
You or your insurance company will  be billed for all office visits, tests, medications and procedures 
that are part of your routine medical care outside of this research study.  You will be responsible for 
paying your co-pay that is associated with any office visit, test, medication or procedure.  Some 
insurance companies will not pay for medical bills for people who participate in a research study.   It is 
your responsibility to find out what costs, if any, your insurance company will cover before taking part 
in the study. If you need help finding out what your insurance company will cover, please ask your 
study doctor for assistance. If your insurance company does not pay for your bills associated with this 
study, you will be responsible for paying them.”   UofL Institutional Review Boards

 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Phase 2 Study of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood  Infusion 
for Adults with Ischemic Stroke – CoBIS 2  
Summary:  This is a multicenter, placebo controlled, randomized, 
double-blinded Phase 2 study in 100 subjects 18- 90 years of 
age who have sustained a recent ischemic stroke. Potential 
subjects can be scre ened on the day of the primary stroke 
event, after confirmation of ischemic stroke, but neurological 
status must be confirmed within 24 hours prior to infusion. 
Consent may be obtained ≥ 24 hours following stroke onset (Day 1), but no later than 10 days af ter the index stroke 
event.  Treatment with umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells or 
placebo will be administered intravenously as a single infusion as early as 3  days  but no later than 10 days  after the 
patient’s stroke. Administration of UCB cells or placebo diluent will only be done after confirmation of eligibility criteria. UCB units will be selected from an accredited U.S. public cord bank based on blood type and a targeted cell dose rangi ng between 0.5 to 5 x 10
7 total nucleated cell count 
(TNCC )/kg. Study patients will not receive 
immunosuppressive or myeloablative medications prior to infusion of the cord blood or placebo.  
All subjects, families and medical staff will be blinded to treatment arm. When a subject is randomized to study drug at a clinical site without a cord blood bank, the selected cord blood units (CBU)  will be shipped frozen overnight to the 
site. Once selected and available on site, each CBU  will be 
thawed, washed, test ed, released and infused intravenously 
using common standard operating procedures (SOPs) at all sites. For subjects randomized to placebo, a diluent with the same appearance and odor as a CBU  will be prepared.  
Patients will have magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI ) at 
baseline and will be assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months for functional outcomes. All patients will receive standard of care therapy while enrolled in this study and all subjects will be strongly encouraged to participate in rehabilitative therapy . 
Objectives:  
 Primary   
To determine, in a randomized, placebo controlled trial, the efficacy of a single intravenous  (IV)  infusion of unrelated 
donor UCB for improving functional outcomes in patients 
with ischemic stroke

  Secondary  objectives  1. To describe the safety and tolerability of a single IV 
infusion of unrelated donor UCB in patients with 
ischemic stroke  
2. To evaluate the efficacy of a single IV infusion of 
unrelated donor UCB for improvement of neurological symptoms following ischemic s troke  
3. To evaluate the efficacy of a single IV infusion of 
unrelated donor UCB for improvement in quality of life and emotional and cognitive status in patients with 
ischemic stroke  
Exploratory objectives:   
The following may be pursued if adequate data are available:   
To determine whether biomarkers of brain inflammation, neuronal injury, and repair are differentially expressed as a function of UCB administration   
Endpoint s 
 Primary  endpoints:   The primary endpoint is the shift in modified Rankin Scale (mRS) from baseline to 3 months post infusion.  
 
 Secondary  endpoints:  1. Safety and tolerability of donor UCB infusion in adults 
with ischemic stroke will be assessed by the following :  
a. Incidence and severity of infusion reactions  
b. Incidence and severity of product -related infections  
c. Evidence of alloimmunization via anti -HLA and 
anti-RBC antibodies and nonspecific markers of 
systemic inflammation ( including erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate [ ESR], C-reactive protein [ CRP ]) 
d. Incidence and severity of g raft vs. host disease  
e. Incidence and severity of unexpected adverse events (AEs), by relation to study product  
f. Mortality  
2. Functional independence at 90 days  defined as a 90 -day 
mRS score of 0, 1, or 2  
3. mRS shift score at 30 and 180 days  post infusion  
4. The Nati onal Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 
score at 90  days  
5. The Barthel Index (BI) at 90  days  
6. The Stroke Impact Scale- 16 at 90 days

 7. The European Quality of Life (EQ -5D-3L) survey at 
90 days  
8. Patient Health Questionnaire Scale (PHQ -8) at 90 days 
9. Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) total 
score at 30 days  and 12 months 
10. Stroke Inventory Test Battery scores at 90  days  
 
Exploratory Endpoints  Inflammatory cytokines  and biomarkers of brain injury and 
repair ( for example, S100 calcium-binding protein B 
[S100B], TNFα, IL 1β, IL -4 and IL -10, VEGF, BDNF, 
MMP9 ) in peripheral blood at baseline, within 6 -24 hours 
after UCB infusion, and 90 days  (Research Blood Samples)  
Population: The target population is 100 patients ages 18-90 years with recent, acute, cortical, hemispheric, ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution without a clinically significant midline shift as detected by MRI as a DWI abnormality.

Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 6-15 (R) and 6- 18 (L) at the 
time of informed consent. Subjects with > 4 point increase of 
NIHSS from time of consent (worsening of score) will not be 
eligible for infusion.  
Patients must have a platelet count >100,000/uL, hemoglobin >8gm/ dL, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 1200 for 
African American patients and ≥1500 for all other racial -
ethnic groups, and white blood cells ( WBC ) >2,500/uL 
OR 
Historical pre -stroke value of ALC ≥ 1200 for African 
American and ≥1500 for all other racial -ethnic groups within 
6 months of stroke

 1 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS   
1.1 Overview  
Stroke is a major cause of death and long -term disability, affect ing one in every six people 
worldwide . Approximately 795,000 Americans suffer a stroke each year, 140,000 of which result 
in fatality, making  stroke  the third leading cause of death  in the US .2-4 Although stroke can occur 
at any age, t he majority (~75%) occur  among  individuals over the age of 65, and risk of stroke 
more than doubles  each decade after the age of 55 . The costs associated with  stroke in the US , 
including health care services, medication, follow -up and missed work  days , total  approximately  
$36.5 billion each year .  
About 88% of all strokes are ischemic strokes, which occur when blood flow to the brain is 
blocked by a clot or mechanical event. Following vascular occlusion, a complex chain of events 
occur at a molecular level leading to irreversible tissue injury, including failure of energy 
synthesis and loss of transmembrane ionic gradients dependent on active transport. In the region with severely reduced blood flow, processes result in rapid cell necrosis affecting all the cellular elements. Rapid resto ration of perfusion or blood flow to the surrounding area is the most robust 
predictor of good clinical prognosis following ischemic stroke. Immediately after the stroke, 
edema, loss of sensory input and inflammation occur around the infarct.
5 Some early recovery is 
realized with resolution of edema and inflammation but immunomodulation, angiogenesis, 
endogenous neurogenesis, and altered gene expression may be required for long -term recovery.  
To date, no approved pharmacological  treatment to pr omote revascularization in ischemic stroke 
exists outside of intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) . The most effective use of 
tPA is limited to treatment within 3.0 hours from documented symptom onset , with diminishing 
effectiveness after 4.5  hours.6 Given the time limitations and increased risk of bleeding  including 
symptomatic intracerebral hemor rhage (ICH) , tPA is used in only about 20% of patients with 
ischemic stroke, and cannot be used in hemorrhagic stroke.6,7 Recent data also suggest the utility 
of mechanical reperfusion via endovascular intervention; however, therapy is limited to patients with proximal occlusion, requires specialized facilities, and has greatest benefit when performed 
within 6 hours following stroke onset.
8-12 Thus, there remains a compelling unmet need for 
therapies to improve outcome after stroke.  
1.2 Rationale for Cellular Therapy in Ischemic Stroke  
There is recent evidence that cellular therapy using unrelated donor, banked umbilical cord blood 
(UCB ) has potential to favorably alter the natural history of stroke in affected pati ents. If 
administered within the first few weeks following stroke, U CB cells are thought to modulate 
ischemic damage in part through paracrine signaling to decrease inflammation and promote 
neurogenesis, thereb y improving functional outcomes in patients. When banked in an accredited 
public cell bank, UCB is a readily available, prequalified, cryopreserved product that can be

 selected for the stroke patient and shipped overnight. Thus , allogeneic UCB cells have t he 
potential to expand access to therapy to many more patients with stroke.  
The CoBIS Phase 1 clinical study, initiated in June, 2015, demonstrated a favorable safety 
profile based on the treatment of  10 male patients, ages 45 to 79, with an IV infusion of 
0.80- 2.00 x 107 TNCC/kg UCB cells from Day 3 to Day 9  post ischemic stroke ( Section 1.5.2). 
The results from this Phase 1 safety study indicate that a placebo controlled study is warranted.  
We hypothesize that cell therapy using stem cells from UCB  will provide benefit by reducing the 
area of permanent injury , promoting plasticity,  and improving functional outcomes for these 
patients. Cel l therapy may favorably alter the natural history of these processes through paracrine 
signaling that reduces inflammation, promotes angiogenesis, neurogenesis and recruitment of 
endogenous cell repair.  
Human UCB  has been widely used as a donor graft for a llogeneic, unrelated donor 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  for more than two decades,13  predominantly to treat 
patients with refractory malignancies or potentially lethal genetic diseases . For those indicati ons, 
the intent is for donor cells to effect  permanent engraftment , providing life -long support of the 
hematopoietic and immune systems . When  long -term engraftment is the goal , the patient  must 
undergo immunosuppression and myeloablation prior to the infus ion of donor cells .  
In contrast, for the indication of ischemic stroke, the desired paracrine effects and recruitment of 
cells to the area of injury  can be achieved with short -term presence of donor cells in the 
recipient , thus eliminating the need for i mmunosuppression. The proposed therapy of allogeneic 
UCB  cells given to immunocompetent patients with no prior immunosuppression is based on the 
assumption that UCB  cells will ultimately be rejected by an immunocompetent host , with out 
sustained engraftment .  
In animal models of brain injury from ischemic stroke, e xtensive data support the safety profile 
of the infusion of allogeneic cord blood cells , as well as improvements in functional recovery  
(Section 1.3) . Recent , but limited, pilot trials in human stroke patients  support the safety of 
infusion of expanded or non- expanded allogeneic cells from cord blood, umbilical cord , adipose 
tissue  and bone marrow without immunosuppression and myeloablation. A  recent search on 
ClinicalT rials.gov identified  11 current  clinical trials of allogeneic stem cells  for the treatment of 
patients with acute and chronic ischemic stroke  (see Table 1) . While  a number of the se trials 
employ  allogeneic cells  isolated from bone marrow or adipose  tissue , four of them , including  the 
previously cited CoBIS Phase 1 stroke trial, use UCB cells. Three other trials are based on 
proprietary  modified cell lines (SB623 cells  [SanBio, Inc ]; CTX cells , [ReNeuron  Ltd.] ) or a 
proprietary  stem cell product (MultiStem; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  derived from mononuclear bone 
marrow cells .

 26 | Page  One major advantage of UCB cells in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is that 
they are immunologically tolerant, rendering them less reactive to  human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA )-mismatch than bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood grafts .15 Consequently, 
candidates for allogeneic cell transplant who do not have a fully HLA -matched adult donor can 
receive partially HLA -mismatched cord blood donor units without riski ng unmanageable graft 
versus host disease  (GVHD) . This has increased access to transplantation therapy for patients 
with hematological malignancies, congenital immunodeficiency syndrome s, bone marrow failure 
syndromes, hemoglobinopathies , and certain inher ited metabolic diseases  affecting the brain, 
where improvements in neurologic function ha ve been seen .16,17 Similarly, UCB may represent  a 
more tolerable  option for medically fragile stroke patients , who might otherwise need to undergo 
additional procedure s, e.g. , bone marrow harvest or peripheral stem cell collection ; for collection 
of autologous cells . Unlike patients with malignant and genetic diseases, UCB infusions in 
patients with stroke are not intended to durably engraft the hematopoietic or immune systems , 
but rather to circulate and temporarily survive in vivo for sufficient time to alter  behavior of 
endogenous host cells through paracrine signaling . Permanent engraftmen t is not a goal and, as 
such, my elo- and/or immunoablation will not be used in the pres ent study . 
1.3 Cord Blood Cells in Animal Models of Stroke  
Data from animal models of stroke support the safety of UCB  cells, as well as their associat ion 
with improvements in functional recovery . The most extensively studied models are of rodents 
with ischemic brain damage resulting from permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 
in adult rats or transient MCAO accompanied with hypoxia in neonatal rats or mice. Occlusion in 
the animal models is followed by sequential pa thogenic processes starting with massive release 
of excitogenic amino acids, microglial and astrocytic activation, immune cell infiltration, a 
protracted inflammatory cytokine storm, and ultimately neuronal death and tissue infarction.19-22 
Given the xenogenic introduction of human cells into a rodent model, rejection by c irculating 
antibodies and complement would be expected; however, there have been no observations of animal weight loss due to cellular therapy or any indication of GVHD symptoms. I n most animal 
studies  of induced brain ischemia and stroke, human UCB (HUCB)  treatment has instead been 
associated with indicators of anti -inflammatory activity and altered balance of splenic 
lymphocyte populations favoring anti -inflammatory outcomes, suggesting that host response to 
HUCB therapy may be sustained after the cells h ave been eliminated.
20  This is consistent with 
animal studies showing that UCB cells can repair hypoxic/ischemic damage even though the 
cells do not persist for long periods of time in the brain.23 
1.3.1  Possible Mechanisms of UCB Mediated Neuroprotection and Repair  
The ability of UCB to ameliorate various types of central nervous system (CNS) damage has 
been shown in t issue culture and animal studies. While the exact pathways by which UCB cells 
lead to neural sparing and recovery have yet to be completely elucidated, several mechanisms 
have been hypothesized on the basis of animal studies.24  Transplanted cells may migrate to the

• UCB cells may result in increased plasticity of the injured brain by enhancing 
synaptogenesis, neovascularization, and endogenous repair mechanisms and by 
inducing migration and proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells.27  Evidence of 
the angiogenic potential of human bone marrow cells is supported by mouse studies 
demonstrating revascularization of surgically -induced ischemic limbs after IV 
transplantation.28  Stem cells may also infiltrate, proliferate, and differentiate into 
“replacement” neuronal and glial cells and play a role in remyelination.  
• Human hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from multiple sources and administered 
via the IV, intraperitoneal, and intracerebral routes have demonstrated the ability to 
enhance functional recovery in multiple animal models of stroke.29 
Significantly, in certain contexts, UCB cells dampen, rather than augment, inflammatory 
responses through an increase of regulatory T cell populations and the generation of 
monocyte/dendritic cell anti- inflammatory cytokines. In this regard, it is plausible to consider a 
population of UCB cells as an anti -inflammatory agent. In animal models of stroke, 
pro-inflammatory cytokines increase after ischemic brain damage in the affected areas and can 
be readily measured. Conversely, at both the protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) level, IL -2, 
TNFα and IL -1-ß we re shown to be decreased after HUCB treatment in a rat model of stroke.23  
There is evidence that the effects of cord blood cells in the regenerati on and repair processes 
following ischemic stroke are through signaling that increases neurogenesis and angiogenesis in 
areas proximal to the infarct.30 
Additional preclinical work has shown that within the HUCB milieu, monocytes (CD14+) are 
the critical cellular component responsible for neuroprotective and anti -inflammatory effects 
following ischemic brain injury. In a model of stroke induced by MCAO , rats post occlusion 
were injected with HUCB preparations depleted either of monocytes (CD14+), stem cells 
(CD133+), T cells (CD2+) or B cells (CD19+). The group receiving the CD14+ depleted cells 
had the largest and most consistent decrements in behavior al recovery and increased infarct size, 
with activity levels and infarct size similar to untreated MCAO rats.18 
1.3.2  Optimization of Doses, Route and Tim ing of UCB  
The dose dependence of HUCB effect on neurologic recovery has been demonstrated by Vendrame et al.
31,32  Rats were treated 24 hours after MCAO with doses of HUCB ranging from 
1 x 105 to 5 x 107 cells. Behavioral and histological evaluations of the infarct volume clearly 
showed a dose -dependent effect: only the groups dosed with ≥  1 x 106 cells were associated with 
positive outcomes .

 28 | Page  In a rat model of collagenase- induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) , neurologic deficits were 
ameliorated by a single IV injection of cryopreserved human UCB cells ( HUCB):  animals 
receiving  2.4–3.2 x  106 mononucleated H UCB cells IV demonstrated significant improvements 
in the neurologic severity test, the  stepping test and elevated body -swing test ( EBST ) compared 
with saline -injected controls .34   
In a murine stroke model, male mice injected at 5 days  after transient (25 min) MCAO with 
1 x 106 HUCB cells IV  had significant reduction in neurological deficit (improved  
NeuroSeverity Score [ NSS]) (p=0.0193) , improved 10- day survival (83% vs. 50%, respectively) , 
and a reduction in infarct volume , relative to vehicle control  (Figure 1) . No difference in 
Rotarod (RR) performance was  observed between the two cohorts  (preliminary results from the 
authors of this protocol (unpublished)) . The same authors conducted a second study to determine 
if the time of HUCB treatment after ischemic brain injury  affected outcome s:  mice subjected to 
transient MCAO ( 15 min)  were randomized to injection of HUCB at either 2 or 5 days  post 
MCAO, or injection of vehicle at 2 days  post MCAO. At 10 days  post MCAO -induced stroke, 
animals infused with HUCB on either Day 2 or Day 5 exhibited a significant reduction (~2- fold) 
in neurological deficit (improved NSS) (p=0.0329 and 0.0352, respectively) as well as functional 
improvement by RR performance (p=0.0361 and 0.0006, respectively), relative to controls (Figure 2). However, no significant difference in infarct size was observed among the three 
cohorts .

 31 | Page  Among rats injected with 3  x 106 HUCB IV at either 1 or 7  days  after MCAO -induced ischemic 
brain injury, HUCBs were found to have survived and migrated to the damaged brain areas, 
primarily to the ischemic boundary zone. Significant improvements were observed in the group 
administered HUCB 1 day after MCAO but not at 7 days  post MCAO, suggesting that early 
administration of HUCB was more efficacious than delayed treatment.23  
Various delivery routes for stem cells have been used in the treatment of neurological disorders 
in both preclinical and clinical studies , including stereotactic transplantation into the br ain, intra -
arterial, intrathecal,  IV and intranasal delivery , and evidence  has been mixed as to whether route 
of cell transplantation  impacts the extent of behavioral recovery .35-39 In a rat MCAO model, 
Willing et al compared the effect of HUCBs injected intravenously into the femoral vein or 
directly into the striatum. Although both groups demonstrated improvements in several measures 
of hyperactivity and passive avoidance tests,  only the group treated by femoral vein injection ha d 
significant improvement in the stepping test, an indicator of recovery from asymmetric motor deficits.
25 Similar conclusions have been made regarding stem cell delivery to treat stroke in 
humans :  among the current stem cell stroke trials  listed on ClinicalT rials.gov, the favored  
method of stem cell delivery is intravenous  (Table 1) . 
In this regard, r ecent studies suggest that intravenously injected UCB cells interact with the 
immune system in the spleen of experimental animals and elicit the formation of cells or cytok ines that subsequently have t herapeutic effects in the brain .
40 Intravenously injected 
mesenchymal cells have similar therapeutic allocrine effects on the brains of animals with s troke 
or traumatic brain injury. Acosta et al  recently showed in a rat model of chronic stroke that 
human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) delivered intravenously preferentially migrated to the spleen over the brain .
41 Furt hermore, cells survived better in the spleen relative to the brain , 
which in turn correlated with improvement of neurostructural deficits and inflammation. Coupled with down- regulation of TNFα density in the spleen, cell tr ansplantation was associated with 
reduced infarct size  and attenuated stroke -induced inflammation in the brain, su pport ing the 
hypothesis  that stem cells provide a therapeutic benefit by acting in the spleen to dampen 
inflammation and subsequent cell death associated with chronic stroke. A (optional) spleen sub-study will be conducted to verify the natural history of splenic response in stroke patients, and 
investigate the effect of UCB  cells  in alterin g the splenic response and correlating this with 
peripheral cytokine and WBC counts.  
In this Phase 2 trial, UCB will be administered intravenously to patient s within 3 –10 days  
following ischemic stroke . Following IV injection, UCB may elicit local and/or allocrine 
responses to on going  inflammatory or tissue damage signals that can down regulate brain 
pathology . The activities of UCB that have been documented in laboratory studies are consistent 
with data demonstrating the ir ability to dampen an ongoing aut oimmune and/or inflammatory 
response in the brain and promoting CNS repair.
42 Furthermore, our Phase 1 study indicated that 
delivery of UCB int ravenously was safe and well tolerated in 10 adults with acute ischemic 
stroke.

 32 | Page  In summary, literature suggests xenogenic infusion of human UCB cells in animals following 
ischemic injury offer s changes in animal behavior representative of recovery . The pro portional 
doses of cells used in animal studies have exceeded the proposed human dose  in this current 
study  with no documentation of animal safety issues . Optimal timing of dose and route of 
administration  remain poorly defined.  
1.4 Clinical Trial Experience with Cord Blood Cells in Treatment of  Stroke and 
Other Ischemic Brain Injuries –  Duke University  
The rationale for cord blood therapy is based on the hypothesis that UCB cells act through paracrine and allocrine mechanisms to modulate and down regulate  inflammation and/or immune 
pathology, possibly protecting neurons from further damage and promoting  neurorepair.  In 
ongoing clinical trials at Duke  University , autologous UCB cells have been administered to 
patients with cerebral palsy (CP) and patients  with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) , both 
diseases thought to arise from an acute hypoxic/ischemic event leading to  a pathological cascade 
that closely parallels events in the animal models that have been successfully treated with UCB .
39,43 In addition, 15 children have been infused with haploidentical or matched sibling cord 
blood on a P hase 1 study over the past year and no safety concerns were identified.  
1.5 Human Clinical Data Using Autologous Stem Cells  in the Treatment of 
Stroke  
There are no Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved biomedical treatments using stem 
cells for the core symptoms of s troke . Numerous groups have conducted Phase 1 and 2 clinical 
trials and reported safety of infusion of various autologous cell populations delivered to patient s 
with acute (1 day  – 9 days ), subacute (~10 – 30 days ), and chronic (6  – 60 months) stroke. To 
date, ap proximately 8 such studies have been reported on ClinicalTrials.gov as ‘completed’ 
(Table 2) . The majority of these included stem cells isolated from b one marrow , although one 
completed study in chronic stroke patients conducted in China used stem cells isolated from peripheral blood ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The results from these clinical trials  reported safety of 
infusion of autologous stem cells for the treatment of stroke . Banerjee et al reported significant 
improvement in clinical functional scores and reductions in lesion volume with intra -arterial 
immunoselected CD34+ cells from autologous bone marrow in 5 patient s ages 30 –80 with acute 
ischemic stroke , with  no significant treatment-  related adverse effects .
44 In a separate study, 
Savitz et al found IV delivery of autologous BMSCs to  be safe in the treatment of 10 patients  
ages 18 –80 with acute ischemic stroke.45

 34 | Page  In a Phase 1 study  conducted in India , favorable outcomes were described for 9 patients ages 30 –
70 with subacute stroke  after treatment with IV injection of  autologous BMSCs .54 The study was 
expanded to a Phase 2 , multicenter, parallel group, randomized trial  (n=120) , with 58 patients 
receiving BMSCs at  a median of 18.5 days  after stroke .49 In the larger Phase 2 study, a lthough 
the cells were shown to be safe, response based on the mRS and Barthel Index (BI) at 180 days  
showed no beneficial effect of treatment on stroke outcome. 
1.5.1  Clinical Trials of Allogeneic Stem Cells in Patients with Stroke  
Treatment with a llogeneic HUCB  cells without prior immunosuppression has been  report ed by 
Yang et al in a variety of degenerative conditions including paraplegia, ataxia, multiple sclerosis, 
ALS, brai n disease and brain injury .55 Cells from digested cord  were evaluated for safety in 
114 humans with no SAE s reported for hematological, immunological and biochemical 
endpoints . By contrast, more  approved therapies have been reported for the use of allogeneic 
UCB  in patients with inherited metabolic diseases and oncology  using prior 
immunosuppression.39  
There are several clinical trials in various stages that are investigating the use of allo geneic cell 
therapy  using selected populations of cells  for the treatment of ischemic stroke  (Table 1 ). Cell 
products used in these trials are derived from adipose tissue, BMSC’s, umbilical cord, UCB  and 
fetal neural stem cells .  
• One completed pilot study in 4 patients  with chronic stroke  (3 ischemic, 1 hemorrhagic) 
showed treatment with allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC’s) isolated 
from umbilical cord was safe and associated with no adverse events  (AEs).56 
• Further more , in patients with  ischemic stroke , but not intracranial hemorrhage, MSCs 
improved the neurological function as asses sed by the mRS ,57 although the small sample 
size is a major limitation of this study .  
• In contrast, a second completed Phase 2 randomized stud y using MultiStem, a proprietary 
stem cell product  derived from mononuclear bone marrow cells in the setting of acute 
stroke (n= 140), found no differences in 90 day outcome between therapy and placebo 
group, although treatment was associated with lower rates of mortality and life 
threatening  AEs .58,59 
• An additional group using modified stromal cells (SB623 cells) transplanted into the 
brains of patients suffering from chronic stroke recently reported improvement in clinical 
outcome endpoints at 12 months in a Phase 1 study.14  
• The PISCES stroke trial uses immortalized fetal neural stem cells surgically implanted 
into the brains of patients with chronic stroke and is currently recruiting for a Phase 2 
trial.60  
Phase 2 Study of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion for Adults with Ischemic Stroke –  CoBIS 2  
19 Feb 2018  
 35 | Page  • Five studies use stem cells derived from UCB  to treat chronic (3) or acute (2) stroke, 
including Duke  University ’s Phase 1 CoBIS study ( Table 1 ). Compared with BMSCs, 
stem cells from UCB offer improved plasticity, faster growth time, lower immunological 
response against host, and ready availability without the need for invasive procedures in compromised patients. Furthermore, umbilical cord stem cells are biologically closer to 
embryonic stem cells  than adult BMSCs . 
1.5.2  Phase 1 C linical Trial Data in Ischemic Stroke using Allogeneic Cord 
Blood Cells  
Ten adult male patient s were treated in a Phase 1 clinical study (CoBIS) at Duke University and 
Houston Methodist Hospital . Table 3 is a summ ary of  patient demographics , dose of UCB  cells, 
and window of treatment post the primary stroke event. The participants had a mean age of 
61.5 years (range 45 –79); the range of cell doses infused was  0.83–3.34 x  10
7 TNCC/kg, and 
infusions were administered from 3 to 9 days  post stroke . The mRS  was used to characterize 
outcome associated with stroke recovery at baseline, 1  month, and 3 months following stroke. 
The NIHSS was used to measure impairments due to stroke at baseline and 3 months after 
stroke; the BI was used to measure basic activities of daily living. Other measures, such as the 
EQ-5D-3L and PHQ- 8 were used to measure health status . Table 4  shows change in scores from 
baseline to 3 months. All 10 patient s were independent prior to the stroke; 9 patient s had an 
historic mRS of 0 (no symptoms at all) and one patient  (0101)  had an historic mRS of 1 (no 
significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual activities). Safety was assessed 
at 24 hours , days  3–10, and at 3, 6, and 12 mo nths post infusion. As of June, 2016, a total of 
115 AEs  were reported in 10 of 10 patient s (Table 4 ); 8 of these were serious (6 occurring  in one 
study patient  and 2 in a second patient) , were unrelated to study therapy and not reportable . The 
SAE incidence rate, defined as the number of pa tients experiencing an event divided by the 
number receiving treatment, was 20% (2/10 patient s experienced an SAE) . All 10 patients 
shifted at least one grade in mRS from baseline (time of infusion) to 3 months after stroke (range 
1-3 points), indicating i mproved outcome.  
Most stroke patients will show the fastest improvement following a  stroke within the first 
month,61 and in one of the few studies examining change in mRS over time, 58% of patients 
disabled by stroke (mRS 3–5) improved at least one grade in their mRS after 3 months.62 The 
CoBIS  Phase 1 study results are in a greement with this and show that 50%  of the patient s 
exhibited a 1  grade increase (improvement)  in mRS at 3 months relative to baseline (infusion). 
However, 4 out of 10 patient s improved by 2 grades and one patient  by 3 grades, suggesting that 
the UCB ther apy may further benefit ischemic stroke patients. Similarly, all patients 
demonstrated improved NIHSS from time of infusion (mean 11.2 ± 1.6; range 9 -14) to 3 month 
assessment  (mean 5.3±2.2; range 3 -9) with a shift down (improvement) in at le ast 4 points ( mean 
6.1±1.7; range 4 -9 points), and showed improvement in activities of daily life as measured by an 
increase in points on the BI  (mean 52.0±24.7; range 10 -80).

 36 | Page  The results from this Phase 1 study satisfy our primary endpoint by demonstrating a favorable 
safety profile for IV infusion of UCB in adult patient s with ischemic stroke. Furthermore, they 
suggest that outcome measures including  the mRS, NIHSS, and BI are  appropriate assessment 
tools for patients with ischemic stroke. These results support a controlled and randomized Phase 
2 Study using human UCB and placebo in patients with ischemic stroke .

 1.6 Study Rationale and Hypotheses    
The major goal of this Phase 2 study is to study the effects  of allogeneic, unrelated donor, 
UCB IV infusion in patient s following ischemic s troke . Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) will be used to confirm ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) 
distribution . Various  clinical  assessments and outcome measures  will be used to evaluate 
neurological  and physical function and functional outcomes . The rationale for this study 
proposes:  
• The brain exhibi ts plasticity with the ability to recover from injuries due to stroke.  
• Cellular  therapy using UCB may  facilitate  repair of damaged areas of the brain  
through paracrine signaling . UCB cells may recruit endogenous host cells to aid 
in enhancing neural pathway con nectivity restoring functional pathways damaged 
by the stroke .  
• Cellular  therapy may decrease inflammation which may , in turn, limit local tissue 
damage and subsequently increase functional  recovery from injury.  
To have a lasting effect on strok e symptoms, treatment with UCB cells must stimulate 
endogenous mechanisms to repair damaged neuronal pathways and ultimately permit formation of normal patterns leading to changes in the cognitive symptomology of stroke. 
It is important to stress that in this view, for which there is strong preclinical and clinical 
evidence, UCB cells may not be required to proliferate or persist in the recipient. Given that the recipients in this study with ischemic stroke will not be pre -conditioned before 
cord blood infusion and because these patients will have normal immune function prior to 
treatment, we feel it is highly unlikely that durable engraftment of stem and progenitor 
cells from the allogeneic UCB treatment will be required to contribute to any expected 
therap eutic effect.  
1.7 Potential Risks and Benefits  
1.7.1  Known Potential Risks  
UCB cells or placebo will be prepared and infused using SOPs  that have been used in 
over 30,000 individuals worldwide . The potential risks associated with infusion of 
allogeneic UCB include i nfusion related reactions, transmission of infection, Graft vs. 
Host Disease (GVHD), and secondary malignancy. Infusion related reactions include 
anaphylaxis, urticaria, dyspnea, hypoxia, cough, wheezing, bronchospasm, nausea, 
vomiting, hives, fever, hyper tension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, rigors, chills, 
infection, and hemoglobinuria . Symptoms of GVHD, e.g. rash or diarrhea, are unlikely 
and would not be evident until 14 to 100 days  post infusion. It is expected that the cells 
will be immunolo gically rejected within  days  to weeks of administration, eliminating a 
risk of GVHD or aberrant cell proliferation post -infusion. All UCB units are screened for

 sterility and risk of infection or genetic disease transmission and must meet donor 
eligibility  screening and potency release criteria prior to banking to minimize any risks.  
1.7.2  Known Potential Benefits  
Potential benefits of cord blood cell infusions include the possibility that the UCB cells may, via direct or indirect mechanisms, reduce inflammation  and also induce 
neurogenesis and other processes in the brain that decrease the impact of tissue damage 
resulting in improved mental and physical function thereby improving the quality of life 
for the participant and their families following stroke.  
2 OBJECTIVES  AND PURPOSE  
The primary purpose of this Phase 2 study is to determine whether IV infusion of banked 
allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB) improves functional outcome in patients with 
acute ischemic stroke in addition to best medical therapy. The study is designed to 
determine whether a single dose of UCB administered to patients within 3 to 10 days  
following acute ischemic stroke increases the probability of improved functional 
outcomes as compared to placebo therapy. Improved functional outcome will be measured by the shift in mRS performed at 90 days  following stroke. Patients will not be 
pre-treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and each cord blood unit ( CBU ) will be 
obtained from an accredited U.S. public cord bank and selected based on blood type  and 
cell dose, targeting a dose range of 0.5 –5 x 107 total nucleated cell count (TNCC)/kg.  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to determine, in a randomized, placebo controlled trial, the 
efficacy of a single IV infusion of unrelated donor UCB  for improving functional 
outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are as follows:  
1. To describe the safety and tolerability of a single IV infusion of unrelated donor 
UCB  in patients with ischemic stroke  
2. To evaluate the efficacy of a single IV infusion of unrelated donor UCB  for 
improvement of neurological symptoms following ischemic stroke 
3. To evaluate the efficacy of a single IV infusion of unrelated donor UCB  for 
improvement in quality of life and emotional and cognitive status in patients with 
ischemic stroke

2.5 Description of Outcome Measures  
2.5.1  Primary  Outcome Measure  
Mental and physical function will be assessed by  the following :  
2.5.1.1  Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)  
The mRS  is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence 
in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke, and it has become the most 
widely used clinical outcome measure for stroke c linical trials. The mRS is scored from 0 
to 6, and describes a clinically relevant continuum from perfect health without symptoms 
(0) to death (6) .57,63 Administration of the mRS takes  approximately 5 minutes.  
All study p ersonnel performing the mRS must have current certification.   
2.5.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
2.5.2.1  Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by documenting the frequency and severity of AE s occurring 
within 24 hours of cord blood infusion and within the 12- month period post  infusion.  
2.5.2.2  National Institutes of Health Stroke S cale (NIHSS)  
The NIHSS is a common method used by neurologists, nurses, and other medical 
professionals to determine the level of neurological impairment created by a stroke . The 
NIHSS is a 15 -item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of 
acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual -field 
loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory  loss.64 A 
trained observer rates the patient ’s abi lity to answer questions and perform activities . 
Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items . A patient  with a completely normal neurological exam 
and normal mental status will have an NIHSS of 0 . The maximum recordable NIHSS 
score is 42 . The NIHSS can be administered in less than 10 minutes  and should be 
administered by the same currently trained and exper ienced personnel throughout the 
study .

 2.5.2.3  The Barthel Index (BI)  
The B I is a standard measure of disability, widely used in the assessment of patient s with 
stroke . The 10- item scale covers activities involving self -care (feeding, grooming, 
dressing), ability  to use the bathroom , and acts of mobility . The maximum score is 100 
with a higher score reflecting greater independence in the patient. A dministration of the 
BI takes 5 minutes .65  
2.5.2.4  European Quality of Life (EQ -5D-3L) 
The European Quality of Life (EQ -5D-3L) is a standardized measure of health status 
developed by the EuroQoL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health 
for clinical and economic appraisal .66 The assessment comprises the following 5 
dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. 
Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, sever e problems . The 
EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ  VAS ) records the patient ’s self -rated health on a 
visual analog ue scale where the endpoints are labeled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and 
‘Worst imaginable health state’ . The EQ -5D-3L takes less than 5 min utes to complete.  A 
proxy (spouse, family member, or caregiver) is allowed to assist the subject if they are 
unable to complete the survey alone.   
2.5.2.5  Patient Health Questionnaire Scale ( PHQ -8) 
The PHQ -8 is an eight -item questionnaire depression scale establi shed as a valid 
diagnos tic and severity measure for depression disorders including stroke. The 
questionnaire takes approximately 2 min.67  
2.5.2.6  Stroke Impact Scale –16 (SIS -16) 
The Stroke Impact Scale –16 ( SIS-16) is a composite measure of physical function 
developed by Rasch analysis from the 4 physical domains of the SIS: strength, a ctivities 
of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living ( ADL/ IADL ), mobility, and hand 
function.68  It is designed to measure the impact of physical function on disability after 
stroke. The SIS -16 is a valid and reliable measure tool  and because of a less pronounced 
ceiling effect, it is  more sensitive to change than the BI  and the Short  Form -36. The SIS -
16 takes less than 10 minutes to complete. 
2.5.2.7  Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS)  
The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status ™ (TICS™) is a brief, standardized test of 
cognitive  functioning that was developed for use in situations where in person cognitive 
screening is impractical or inefficient (e.g., large -scale population screening, 
epidemiological surveys, with patients who are unable to appear in person for clinical 
follow -up).69 Although the TICS is designed to be administered using the telephone, it 
also may be administered face -to-face. Because it does not require vision, the TICS is 
Phase 2 Study of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion for Adults with Ischemic Stroke – CoBIS 2  
19 Feb 2018  
  45 | Page  
 particularly useful for examining visually impaired individ uals and individuals who are 
unable to read or write.  Research has demonstrated that psychological data obtained over 
the telephone are as reliable and valid as those obtained through face- to-face interaction. 
The TICS correlates highly with the Mini -Mental® State Examination (MMSE ®). It has 
high test- retest reliability and excellent sensitivity and specificity for the detection of 
cognitive impairment. The 11 test items usually take less than 10 minutes to administer 
and score.  
 
All examinee responses are recorded verbatim. If a patient is aphasic BUT capable of writing answers which in turn can be communicated over the phone to the CRC by test proctor then the TICS may be administered and responses accepted. For TICS questions that require speech (e.g., Repeat after me ‘no ifs, ands or buts’ and ‘Methodist Episcopal’) patient will score 0 points. If a patient is aphasic and unable to communicate 
via voice OR by writing answers then the TICS should be left blank. CRC’s should include an explanation such as “patient unable to participate due to aphasia and/or inability to write responses”.  
 
The individual item scores are summed to obtain the TICS Total score. The TICS Total 
score provides a measure of global cognitive functioning and can be used to monitor changes in cognitive functioning over time. The impairment ranges have been shown to 
adequately distinguish between normal participants and patients with cognitive impairment. The appropriate normative reference group for interpretation will depend on 
the reason for the evaluation and on the examinee's age and level of education.  
2.5.2.8  Stroke Inventory Test Battery (SITB)  
This abbreviated neuropsychological test battery utilizes objective measures that are 
sensitive to cognitive dysfunction, with an emphasis on te sts sensitive to deficits in 
learning and recall and of executive control. The test battery utilizes most measures from 
the Stroke Common Data Elements (CDE s).
70 Stroke cognitive CDE s were specifically 
selected to be sensitive indicators of cognition in stroke. Individuals administering these tests will first be trained by a board certified clinical neuropsychologist.  
Trail Making Test
71,72 The first part of this test, Trails A, requires the patient to rapidly sequence 
a strai ghtforward series. The second part, Trails B, is a more difficult cognitive flexibility task 
requiring the patient  to follow a sequential pattern while shifting cognitive sets.  Trails A and B 
together take approximately 15 min to perform.  
Montreal Cognitiv e Assessment (MoCA)73  The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was 
designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different 
cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Time to administer 
the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or 
above is considered normal.

 Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised  (HVLT -R)74 The HVLT -R is a brief assessment of verbal 
learning and memory (recognition and recall) for individuals 16 years and older. It is easy to 
administer and score and is well  tolerated even by significantly impaired individuals.  The 
HVLT -R requires recall of a series of 12 words over three learning trials, free recall after a delay, 
and a recognition trial. The assessment takes approximately 5 -10 minutes with a 25- minute delay 
to complete.  
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -8) (see above)  
Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)75 The Short Form -36 is one of the most widely used 
generic measures of health -related quality of life and has been shown to discriminate between 
subjects with different chronic conditions and between subjects with different severity levels of 
the same disease. The survey is a structured, self-report questionnaire that the patient can 
generally complete with little or no intervention from an interviewer. However, patients with 
visual or upper extremity impairments may need to have the SF-36 administered by a trained 
interviewer. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.  
Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT )76 The COWAT is a  verbal fluency test  that 
measures spontaneous production of words belonging to the same category or beginning with a designated letter . The examination takes approximately 5 minutes.  
Oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)77 The oral SDMT is a neuropsychological test used 
to assess information processing speed and is a sensitive measure for identifying deficits due to 
the presence of cerebral dysfunction.  
2.5.2.9  Rehab ilitation  Survey  − see Appendix 1  
This is a self -reporting survey for patient s to document type and frequency of 
rehabilitation services they received while on study .   
2.5.2.10  Neuroimaging  
As part of normal standard of care, MRI is typically obtained in patients with acute stroke within several  days  of presentation . The i nitial brain MRI imaging performed on patients 
enrolled in this study will use the routine stroke imaging protocol and imaging equipment particular to each institution .  
In the event that cell infusion is scheduled to be initiated >36 hours after the baseline 
brain MRI or other neuroimaging study as performed as standard of care, non- contrast 
computed tomography (CT) of the head will also be obtained within 24 hours prior to 
infusion using routine institutional scan protocol, in order to evaluate for changes in the 
volume of infarcted brain parenchyma and for complications of potential clinical significance such as hemorrhage or increasing mass effect.

 3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Study Design Overview and Duration  
This is a multicenter, placebo controlled, randomized, double-blinded Phase 2 study in 
100 patients 18-90 years of age who have sustained a recent ischemic stroke. Potential 
patients can be consented  ≥ 24 hours following stroke onset  (Day 1), but no later than 
10 days  after the index stroke event. Treatment with UCB cells or placebo will be 
administered intravenously as a single infusion as early as 3  days  after the patient’s 
stroke, but no later than 10 days  after the stroke. Administration of cord blood or placebo 
will only be done after confirmation of eligibility criteria. See Figure 3 for the study flow 
chart.  
Patients will not receive immunosuppressive or myeloablative medications prior to 
infusion of the UCB  cells or placebo . 
For patients randomized to active treatment, the CBUs will be selected from an accredited U.S. public cord bank based on blood type and a targeted cell dose ranging 
between 0.5 to  5 x 10
7 TNCC/kg. For patients randomized to UCB cells at a clinical site 
that has no cord blood bank, the CBU s will be shipped frozen overnight to the site. Once 
a unit is selected and available on site, the cells will be thawed, washed, tested, released 
and infused intravenously using common SOPs at all sites.  
For patients randomized to placebo, a container of diluent with the same appearance and 
odor as the CBU  will be prepared so all patients, families and medical staff are blinded to 
treatment arm.  
Patients will have a baseline brain MRI and  will be assesse d at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months for 
functional outcomes. All patients will receive standard of care therapy at the discretion of 
the Investigator and their other providers while enrolled in this study and all patients will 
be strongly encouraged to participate in rehabilitative therapy.

4 STUDY PRODUCT  
4.1 Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Patient enrollment will be  dependent on the availability of adequately dosed ABO /Rh 
matched  banked CBUs  that have been stored at an accredited U.S. public cord bank. The 
unit must meet donor screening and product characterization as detailed below .  
4.2 Selection of Allogeneic Cord Blood U nits   
CBUs  will be selected based on blood type and the number of cells  in the 
pre-cryopreservation product , targetin g a dose range of 0.5 to 5 x  10
7 TNCC /kg. 
Screening of maternal blood collected within 7 days  before or after delivery is used for 
cord blood donor infectious disease screening . Maternal blood testing must have been

 performed in a Clinical Laboratory Impro vement Amendments ( CLIA ) certified don or-
testing laboratory  and must include  the following:   
• Hepatitis B surface antigen  
• Hepatitis  C antibody  
• HIV-1 and HIV -2 antibodies  
• Human T cell lymphotropic virus  (HTLV )-I and HTLV -II antibodies  
• Cytomegalovi rus (CMV ) 
• Syphilis  
Additional screening , which is dependent on the timing of the cord blood collection, may 
include nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) , hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) , West Nile Virus , and serological testing for Chagas Disease. The  donor mother 
must screen negative for all tests, except for CMV or hepatitis B core antibody 
(anti-HBc) . Units from mothers who test positive for anti -HBc but who test negative for 
HBsAg  and H BV NAT may be used . Records for maternal testing are reviewed at the 
cord blood bank prior to release of the unit for treatment . In addition, for recently banked 
units, donor screening, through the medical history, for Zika virus is performed. 
4.3 Cord Blood Unit  Characterization  Pre-cryopreservation and after Th awing  
Results of initial testing at the cord blood bank must meet the following criteria to be 
acceptable for administration to study patient s: 
• Pre-cryopreservation TNCC  ≥ 0.5x107/kg patient  weight  
• Viability of CD34+ cells ≥ 70%  after thawing  
• Pre-cryopreservatio n sterility culture  with no growth 
All cells recovered post -thaw will be infused.  
On the  day of  infusion, the cord blood will be thawed and washed in an automated 
fashion using the S epax device. If able, ABO will be measured after thawing to cross -
check p re- cryopreservation data prior to infusion. The cells will be resuspended into 
dextran 40 + 5 % human serum al bumin. The final volume of the cellular product to be 
infused will be 50 +/ - 5 mL delivered to the clinic in a Sepax  or transfer bag . 
Post processing of the CBU, a sample will be removed for  standard studies including 
TNCC , viable CD34+ cell count, confirmatory HLA type, cell viability , Colony Forming

 Units (CFU ), and sterility culture s to be performed in the S tem Cell Laboratory or by a 
selected CLIA certified laboratory . This data will not be available prior to infusion.  A 
residual sample of the UCB will be retained for potential future testing . 
4.4 Preparation of Placebo 
In order for the patients, family , and medical staff to be truly blinded to the type of 
infusion they are receiving, the placebo product must be similar in both appearance and 
odor. Therefore, the placebo product will be acellular and will consist of tissue culture 
medium 199 ( TC-199 [ pink] ) with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO),  which are standard 
components in cellular products . The volume of placebo product will  be 50 +/- 5 mL , 
which is in the range of a typical UCB unit that has been washed and thawed after cryopreservation . The 50 +/ - 5 mL  of placebo solution to be infused will be delivered to 
the clinic in a Sepax  or transfer bag matching the final container used for the suspended 
UCB cells, so that the clinical staff remains blinded to study product or placebo.  
4.5 Transport of Study Product   
All study products will be transported from the laboratory to the bedside  for in fusion in a 
validated co ntainer  to maintain room temperature . Once thawed and washed , the cells or 
placebo have an expiry of 6 hours  at room temperature . 
4.6 Administration of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood or Placebo  
On the day of infusion, a peripheral IV will be placed b y the patient’s care team if venous 
access has not been previously established .  
Premed ication  for the cord blood or placebo  infusion will be administered 30- 60 minutes 
prior to the start of the infusion. P remedication  with diphenhydramine 0.5mg/kg/dose IV  
(maximum 50 mg) , hydrocortisone  1mg/kg /dose IV (maximum 100 mg) , and 
acetaminophen  10-15mg/kg (maximum 650 mg orall y [PO] or per rectum [ PR]) will be 
administered.  A ntihypertensive medication may be advised for hypertensive patient s or 
made available if needed in a timely manner , in light of the risk that premedications, 
specifically hydrocortisone, as well as residual DMSO in the cell product may contribute  
to elevation in blood pressure . Staff caring for the patient and the patient’s family should 
be aware that r esidual D MSO in the UCB product often causes a temporary notable odor 
in patient s’ breath and from their skin for up to 24 hours post  infusion. 
The allogeneic cord blood will be administered intravenously over 5 to 30 minutes  not 
exceeding a maximum of 5 mL/kg/hr ; administration will be  under direct physician 
supervision for the duration of infusion. The infusion rate will be reduced if  the fluid load 
is not tolerated . Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate , pulse 
oximetry ) will be checked  before the infusion, every 5 minutes during the infusion, at the 
Phase 2 Study of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion for Adults with Ischemic Stroke –  CoBIS 2

 end of the infusion, then as scheduled in MOP -01 until 4 hours  post  infusion. Patients 
will be observed for at least 4 hours  post infusion and recei ve IV hydration for a 
minimum of 2  hours post  infusion. Hydration will  consist  of normal saline (0.9% NS) 
infused at a minimum of 75 ml/hr. If the patient  is receiving at least this rate  of hydration 
(NS or other fluid) as part of their clinical care, no additional fluids will be given.  
If the patient is discharged before 24 hours have passed since the start of infusion, there 
will be a phone call or observation by the study staff  within 24 hours  after discharge to 
document AE s or any change in status .  
4.7 Care During Unexpected Even ts 
In the event that a patient develops signs or symptoms of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis including urticaria , difficult y breathing, cough, wheezing, or vomiting during their 
infusion, the infusion will be paused, slowed, or terminated . Mild reactions  may be  
treated with additional diphenhydramine, solumedrol , and /or inhaled albuterol . Other 
medications may be given as clin ically indicated by the patient’s physician.   
If a patient has evidence of illness on the day of planned infusion, including but not limited to fever >38. 1° C (100.5°F) , active infection, progressive rash, vomiting, 
diarrhea, or respiratory distress, the infusion will be postponed. If the temperature drops 
and patient stabilizes to 38. 1° C (100.5°F) and remains no higher than this for 24 hours, 
then the infusion may proceed as planned.

 5.2 Patient  Interview  
Patients who are potentially eligible to participate in the study or their legal ly authorized 
representatives  (LARs) will be interviewed by study personnel who are trained to 
describe the study, schedule of visits, verify basic eligibility criteria, answer questions, 
and confirm interest in participation . If the patient  and/or the patient’s LAR  are interested 
and the pat ient appears to be eligible after initial discussions, written informed consent 
will be obtained via the informed consent process .   
5.3 Assessment of Patient Capacity to Consent:  
Informed consent will be obtained by study staff experienced in working with stroke 
patients. The Investigator  will clinically assess whether or not a patient  will be able to 
provide legally effective informed consent at enrollment. A physician will be at every 
study visit to re -evaluate the patient ’s capacity to consent. For patient s who are not able 
to give consent, a LAR  must  sign on the patient ’s behalf. In such cases, the patient  will be 
informed of his or her enrollment in the study when he or she ha s become fully alert: the 
patient  will be told who gave surrogate consent and that the patient  has the right to 
withdraw from the study. The patient  will be asked to sign the consent form at that time.  
5.4 Screening, Consent , Study Visits and Follow -up Phone C alls

 6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION S 
6.1 Accrual  
It is estimated that up to 6 research participants will be enrolled each month at each of the 
6 centers  and that approximately 20- 24 months of accrual will be necessary to enroll 
100 patient s.  
6.2 Study Duration  
Research participants will be followed for 12 months after the administration of allogeneic cord 
blood. 
6.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
The number of patient s completed and discontinued early from study, and the reasons for 
discontinuation, will be summarized, if applicable. Demographics and baseline charact eristics to 
include age, gender, and race/ethnicity and baseline status as measured by the mental and 
physical assessments will be summarized for all patient s. 
6.4 Description of the Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure  
The m RS is a commonly used scale for measuri ng the degree of disability or dependence in the 
daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke, and it has become the most widely used 
clinical outcome measure for stroke clinical trials . The mRS is scored from 0 to 6, running from 
perfect health w ithout symptoms (0) to death (6)57,63 Administration of the mRS takes 5 minutes. 
Personnel performing the mRS must have current certification. 
The mRS is:  
0 - No symptoms.  
1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some 
symptoms.  
2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable 
to carry out all previous activities.  
3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unas sisted.  
4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without 
assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.  
5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, 
incontinent.

 6 - Dead.  
6.5 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
The primary endpoint for this study is the shift in mRS from baseline to 90 days , defined 
for the i -th patient  as: 
𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖=𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚0−𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚90,𝑖𝑖={1..𝑁𝑁} 
Where 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 0 and 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚90 are the baseline and 90 -day mRS scores, respectively. Since a 
shift downward in the mRS scale is considered a clinical improvement, t he differences  in 
𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 are calculated from baseline to insure that, for hypothesis testing purposes, larger shift 
values represent more clinically desirable outcomes.   
Given the above definit ion we can define testable hypotheses for the primary efficacy 
analysis as follows.  
(Null hypothesis) H0: P(T i > P i ) = P ( P i > T i) 
(Alternative hypothesis) HA: P(T i > P i ) ≠ P ( P i > T i) 
Where T i and P i are randomly selected 90 -day mRS shift scores from the population of 
patients treated with cord blood (T) or placebo (P), with the differences having the form 
of 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 shown above.  
The test of this hypothesis can be carried out using a 2- sample Wilcoxon r ank sum test. We used 
Noether’s formula78 to approximate sample size required under various alternatives assuming a 
2:1 allocation (cord:placebo), a 5% Type I error rate, and power of 80%. The specific alternative 
hypothesis, or detectable effect size, in t his case is the probability that a randomly sampled 
patient  treated with cord blood has a higher ( more favorable ) mRS shift score ( 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖) compared with 
a randomly sampled patient  treated with placebo. The probability can also be understood as an 
odds ratio (OR)  comparing treatment to placebo . The following table ( Table 6 ) illustrates sample 
sizes required to detect various effect sizes (expressed both as probabilities and ORs) ass uming 
the aforementioned design parameters.

0.66 1.9 123 41 82 
0.67 2.0 102 34 68 
 
An effect size of p=0.67 (OR=2.0) was selected for this study as it is felt to be the minimal 
clinically relevant effect size and is detectable with a reasonable sample size. The total sample size required is N=102 (68 on cord blood and 34 on placebo). For simplicity we round the 
number to N=100. 
Therefore, with a total sample size of N=100 (67 on cord blood and 33 on placebo), our study 
will have approximately 80% power to detect a significant difference between cord blood and 
placebo when the true probability of a greater mRS shift in cord blood patients ( compared to  
placebo) is 67%. This equates to a doubling of the odds that a randomly selected patient treated 
with cord blood wi ll have a more favorable mRS shift score compared with a randomly selected 
patient treated with placebo. These calculations assume a Type I error rate of 5%.  
6.6 Correction for Multiple Testing  
The primary efficacy analysis will use an alpha of 0.05. Statistically significant results on the secondary efficacy endpoints will be identified using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure. The primary efficacy comparison will be included in the FDR procedure. Analysis of safety outcomes and exploratory endpoints will be primarily descriptive and thus will not include correction for multiple testing. Further details are available in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
6.7 Randomization Plan  
This study will randomize participants 2:1 to cord blood or placebo and will utilize a randomly 
varying block size with stratification by study center ( up to 6 centers ) and NIHSS score (6 –11 or 
12-18). The  NIHSS score collected closest to randomization  will be used .

19 Feb 2018  
  65 | Page  
 6.8 Analysis Plan  
Full details of the planned analysis are available in t he accompanying SAP. Briefly, safety 
analyses will be primarily descriptive and will use  graphical displays and tabulated descriptive 
statistics. The efficacy analysis for the primary endpoint is based on the normal approximation to 
a two -sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. Additional analyses are described in the SAP. 
6.8.1  Analysis Populations (see SA P for further details):  
Full Analysis Population  – This population includes  all enrolled participants and is used 
for descriptive purposes;  e.g. to identify patient s who do not provide data for  the primary 
efficacy analysis.  
Modified Intention to Treat (mITT) Population  – This analysis set will include only 
patient s who complete the mRS at both baseline and 90 days . Calculation of the mRS 
shift score is not possible in patients who are missing either the baseline or 90- day mRS 
evaluation. Patient s will b e analyzed according to the treatment they were assigned 
(regardless of what they actually receive).  
Safety Population  – The safety population will include all patient s who received an  
infusion. Analyses of the Safety Population will be conducted using an as-treated 
approach, which considers each patient according to the treatment actually received 
rather than the treatment they were assigned.  
6.9 Interim Analysis  
An interim estimation of conditional power79 will be conducted when the primary endpoint is 
evaluable on approximately 50% of the participants (17 patients in the placebo group 34 in the 
cord blood group). Conditional power will be evaluated assuming future data are consistent with 
the observed trend at the time of the interim analysis as well as the p lanned alternative. There is 
no a priori threshold for curtailing the trial for futility. Rather, the interim analysis is intended to 
provide information to the DSMB and study sponsor to assist with determining whether the trial should proceed as designed, or whether the plans detailed in this protocol are realistic under reasonable alteration to the pre- specified sample size. The interim analysis will be accomplished 
by an independent, unblinded statistician. 
7 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
7.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product .   
Phase 2 Study of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion for Adults with Ischemic Stroke –  CoBIS 2  
19 Feb 2018  
  66 | Page  
 7.1.1  Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is con sidered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life  threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or 
significan t incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life  
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
7.1.2  Grade/Severity  
Grade/Severity will be performed per  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE ) guidelines.  
7.1.3  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the investigational product caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable pos sibility’ means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the adverse event.  
7.1.4  Causality  
The Investigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse event to 
the investigational pro duct:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event?  An 
affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
All AE s reported or observed during the study beginning at the time of the allogen eic cord blood 
infusion must be recorded and maintained in the study participant’s paper files  or electronic case 
report forms . Information to be reported includes when the site became aware of the event, 
Investigator -specified assessment of severity and r elationship to study therapy, whether there is 
an alternative etiology, seriousness, as well as any required treatment for evaluations, and 
outcome . In general, investigat ors should report AEs  as diseases or syndromes whenever 
possible, instead of reporting individual component symptoms, signs, laborator y abnormalities, 
and sequelae. Severe advers e reactions (fatal or life threatening) that are unexpected and related 
will be reported to the FDA by Duke University within seven calendar  days  of receipt of the  
information by telephone, mail or fax, following FDA guidelines . All non- life threatening 
serious, related and unexpected AEs will be reported to the FDA via a written report within 
15 days  of receipt of the information (21CFR 312.32) by Duke University . If the Principle 
Investigator assesses  the event to be unrelated to the study, then the event will not require 
expedited reporting but will be included in a summary report .

blood infusion within 6 months of infusion 
• Any patient  develops grade III -IV G VHD within 6 months of infusion 
A consensus decision to stop the study will be made by the Investigators and the DSMB. Such a 
decision with its supporting documentation and possible future plans for the study will be 
submitted to, and discussed with, the FDA . 
7.6 Patient  Replacement  
Treatment assignments will not be replaced for patient s who are not infused, lost to follow -up, or 
are discontinued from the study. However, additional patient s may be randomized per decision 
of the study sponsor.  
8 DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  
A DSMB will be formed and charter established . Faculty of Duke University Medical Center or 
other participating clinical sites are exempted from participation on this study DSMB . Members 
of the DSMB will comprise  neurolo gists and a physician with experience in cell therapy . A non -
voting statistician will be invited to meetings or calls as needed. The DSMB will be notified 
immediately for all SAE s directly related to study product throughout the study . A total safety 
asses sment will be prepared on an annual basis and forwarded to the DSMB for review as well . 
Policies of the DSMB will be described in the DSMB charter, and signed by all members .  
9 DATA HANDLING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
9.1 Case Report Forms  
As part of the responsibil ities assumed by participating in the study, the Principal Investigator or 
Sub- Investigators agree to maintain adequate case histories of the research participants treated as 
part of the research under this protocol . The Principal Investigator and Sub- Investigator agree to 
maintain accurate case report forms (CRFs ) and source documentation as part of the case 
histories.  RTI will supply the CRFs electronically (eCRF) through secured electronic data entry 
systems .  
9.2 Inspection of Records  
The Principal Investig ator and  Sub- Investigators at all institutions involved in the study will 
permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s) by providing

19 Feb 2018  
  69 | Page  
 Sub- Investigator agrees to allow the s ponsor, the FDA, or other regulatory agency access to all 
study records .  
The Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigators should promptly notify the sponsor and monitor 
of any audits scheduled by any regulatory authorities and promptly forward copies of any audit 
reports received to both.  
9.3 Study Record Retention 
The study results will be retained  in the patient ’s research record for six years after the study. 
Essential documents should be retained until at least two  years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an International C ouncil on Harmonisation region and until there are no 
pending or contemplated marketing applications in an International Council on Harmonisation 
region , or at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical 
development of the investigational product . These documents should be retained for a longer 
period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements.  
10 ADMINISTRA TIVE ASPECTS  
10.1 Confidentiality  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner designed to maintain research participant confidentiality . All records will be kept in a 
secure storage area with limited access . Clinical information will not be released without the 
written permission of the research participant’s LAR  except as necessary for monitoring and 
auditing.  
The Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigator and all employees and coworkers involved with 
this study may not disclose or use for any purpose other than performance of the study, any data, 
record, or other unpublished, confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the purpose of the study . Prior written agreement from the s ponsor or its designee must be obtained 
for the disclosure of any said confidential information to other parties. 
10.2 Institutional Review Board Approval  
Federal regulations and the International Council on Harmonisation guidelines require that 
approval be obtained from  an IRB prior to participation of human research participants in 
research studies . Prior to the study onset, the protocol, informed consent, any advertisement used 
to recruit study patients, and any other written information regarding this study to be provided to 
the research participant or the research participant’s LAR must be approved by the IRB . 
Documentation of all IRB approvals and of the IRB compliance with International Council on 
Harmonisation  Guideline E6 will be maintained by the site and will be  available for review by 
the sponsor or its designee. 
Phase 2 Study of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion for Adults with Ischemic Stroke –  CoBIS 2  
19 Feb 2018  
  70 | Page  
 All IRB approvals should be signed by the IRB Chairman or designee and must identify the IRB 
name and address, the clinical protocol by title and/or protocol number, and the date the approval 
and/or favorable opinion was granted.  
The Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigator is responsible for obtaining continued review of 
the clinical research at intervals not exceeding one year or otherwise specified by the IRB . The 
Principal Investigator or Sub- Inves tigator must supply the s ponsor or its designee with written 
documentation of continued review of the clinical research.  
10.3 Modification of the Protocol  
Any changes in this research activity, except those necessary to remove an apparent, immediate hazard to t he research participant, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB .  
10.4 Informed Consent  
A written informed consent in compliance with Part 50 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the clinical site’s IRB shall be obtained from each research  participant 
prior to entering the study or performing any unusual or non- routine procedure that involves risk 
to the research participant .   
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective research participant and/or his/her LAR  will 
be given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the approved informed consent 
form . Once the Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigator is assured that the research participant/ 
LAR  understands the implications of participating in the study, the research pa rticipant/ LAR  
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing the informed consent form.  
The Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigator shall provide a copy of the signed informed 
consent to the research participant and/or  LAR . A seco nd original form shall be maintained in 
the research participant’s medical records at the site.  
Informed consent will be obtained by study staff experienced in working with stroke patients. 
The Investigator  will clinically assess whether or not a patient  will be able to provide informed 
consent at enrollment. A physician will be at every study visit to re -evaluate the patient ’s 
capacity to consent. For patient s who are not able to give consent, a LAR must sign on the 
patient ’s behalf. In such cases, the p atient  will be informed of his or her enrollment in the study 
when he or she  has become fully alert: the patient  will be told who gave surrogate consent and 
that the patient  has the right to withdraw from the study. The patient  will be asked to sign the 
consent form at that time.  
10.5 Protocol Violations and Deviations  
The Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigator or designee must document and explain in the 
research participant’s source documentation any deviation from the approved protocol . The 
Phase 2 Study of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion for Adults with Ischemic Stroke –  CoBIS 2  
19 Feb 2018  
  71 | Page  
 Principal Inv estigator or Sub- Investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the 
protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study research participants without prior IRB 
approval . As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the 
reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB for 
review and approval, to the s ponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or  unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by the IRB and agreed to by the Principal Investigator or 
Sub- Investigator . Deviations usually have an impact on individual research participants or a 
small group of research participan ts and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint 
criteria .  
A protocol violation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol that results in a significant, additional risk to the research participant; when the research participant or Pri ncipal 
Investigator or Sub- Investigator has failed to adhere to significant protocol requirements 
(inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the research participant is enrolled without prior s ponsor 
approval ; or when there is nonadherence to FDA regulations and/or International Council on 
Harmonisation  GCP guidelines.  
Protocol violations and deviations will be documented by the clinical monitor throughout the course of monitoring visits . Principal Investigators or Sub- Investigators will be notified of 
violations a nd/or deviations in writing by the monitor . The Principal Investigator should ensure 
that the IRB is  notified of all protocol violations and deviations in a timely manner as require d. 
10.6 Study Reporting Requirements  
By participating in the study, the Principa l Investigator or Sub- Investigator agrees to submit 
reports of  SAEs  according to the timeline and method outlined in the protocol . In addition, the 
Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigator agrees to submit annual reports to his/her IRB as 
appropriate . The Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigator s also agree to provide Duke 
University  with an adequate report shortly after completion of the Principal Investigator’s or 
Sub- Investigator’s participation in the study.  
11 Financial Obligations  
Duke University  is not financially responsible for further testing/treatment of any medical 
condition that may be detected during the screening progress. In addition, in the absence of specific arrangements, Duke University  is not financially responsible for further trea tment of the 
research participant’s disease.

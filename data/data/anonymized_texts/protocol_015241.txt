 BACKGROUND  
More than 100,000 Americans 
initiate hemodialysis (HD) each year. 
More than 80% of patients use central 
venous catheters ( CVC ) as their initial 
vascular access, with only a quarter of 
such patients having a concurrent AVF 
(composed of native vessels) or AV G 
(with use of prosthetic vascular graft 
material) which might mature into use.1 
AVF promotion has been part of the 
government’s Healthy People 2010  
and 2020 objectives, and numerous local 
and nationa l initiatives, with only 
incremental improvements.1 The 
proportion of AVF use in new HD patients 
has remained below 20% over the past 
decade (Figure 1.)  
 
 CVC  use for HD impose s many 
disadvantages upon patients , some lethal . CVC perform less reliably than AVF or AVG, 
resulting in  reduced treatment efficiency . CVC are large devices that damage the veins in 
which they dwell, increasing the risks of thromboembolic events, as well as  stenosis, 
occlusion, and superior vena cava syndrome.2 CVC are long -term intravascular devices that 
may also result in central line associated bacteremias (CLABSI), which may be complicated 
by secondary infections such as infectious endocarditis and verte bral osteomyelitis.3 The 
prevalence of each of these complications increases with the duration of CVC use.4  
 
The net effects of all of these disadvantages is markedly decreased survival among HD 
patients using CVC, with increased hospitalization, costs, and suffering. Over the first two years of 
HD, CVC use falls, to approximately 12%. Unfortunately, this apparent ‘improvement’ is due not 
just to conversion from CVC to 
AVF/G, but also due to excess 
mortality among patients with CVC 
(Figure 2). Therefore, strategies that 
avert the need for CVC placement and 
reduce the duration of catheter use 
would both be expected to improve 
the health and survival of people 
receiving hemodialysis.  
Arteriovenous fistula s (AVF)  
are universally acknowledged to be 
the safest way to access the 
bloodstream for hemodialysis5-10. 
Successful AVF require  the preservation of native veins, which must  dilate after 
surgery . Guidelines suggest that all suitable forearm and upper -arm veins should  be 010203040506070

 preserved in patients with  chronic kidney disease (CKD) and  estimated glomerular 
filtration rates  (eGFR)  of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, avoiding  both peripheral and 
subclavian veni punctur e for any reason11.  
 
  Despite this, c onstruction of a viable AVF is often complicated  or prevented  by 
veins of insufficient diameter  or quality.6,7,12 An AVF must ‘mature’ after creation, which 
means that the vessel must dilate sufficiently to carry a high blood flow, and the walls 
of the outflow vein must  thicken  and become strong enough to endure repetitive 
needle cannulation  and vein dilation in order  to remain patent and accommodate 
repetitive needle cannulation.9-16 Vein dilation is one of the key requirements for AVF 
maturation , although blood  flow rates, vessel depth, and the length of the accessible 
segment of  vein are also important . Most surgeons require that the target vein for an 
AV fistula have a diameter of at least 2.5 -3.0 mm  in either the upper or lower arm . 
Unfortunately, many arm veins fail to dilate and enlarge sufficiently  after AVF creation, 
which expose s the constricted vein to  arterial flow and associated high wall shear 
stress.  When AVF fail to matur e, patients are exposed  to the risks of CVC for longer 
periods, and are subjected to additional  surgery and  invasive percutaneous  
procedures, resulting in hospital  readmissions, de layed care , and increased cost s.17-
21 In a carefully performed multicenter study, the 49% of AVF matured, and another 
22% required additional procedures; 28% failed outright.22 Many studies have 
concluded that it is hard to predict which veins will enlarge  to the appropriate size for 
dialysis use even after preoperative vein mapping studies.11,22-25 Clinicians try to refer 
patients for AVF 6 months prior to the need for HD, to allow for these uncertainties, 
but this is may not be a realistic approach for al l patients.  
 
Another popular approach is to encourage  patients to develop their veins by 
exercising their arms before and after  AVF surgery, with the expectation that exercise 
will increase blood flow to the limb and that this will dilate veins. P atients have 
traditionally been instructed to apply intermittent compression to the upper arm with 
elastic  bands, to perform  hand exercises (e.g. squeezing a soft rubber device ) and 
isometric exercises  of the entire arm .26-27 Studies  have shown some benefit s of 
exercise  in promoting  vein dilation and possible fistula maturation.28-29 The data are 
more e xtensive for beneficial effects of  intermittent compression, handgrip training , 
external heat application , and topical agents like nit ric oxide on vessel  dilation.25-33 
Effects of pneumatic compression on venous flow have been widely studied, and are 
standard of care for the management of lymphedema, prevention of perioperative 
deep venous thrombosis, and therapy for venous stasis ulcerations.34-38 
 
There is a n urgent  need to find more effective methods to promote  vein 
dilation  and develop  cost effective , non -invasive devices to help mature fistulae  
clinically , and help  AVF mature . The Fist Assist® device (US Patent 8231558) is an 
external medical intermittent pneumatic compression device that can apply 
intermittent pressure to the arm. Aside from the direct hemodynamic effects of 
pneumatic compression, t here is evidence for effects on wall shear st ress and wall 
5 
 tensile stress for both arteries and veins, which may stimulate the endothelium to 
produce nitric oxide that enhances venous dilation.39-41 This research  will evaluate 
the effects of  using the Fist Assist® device  to develop veins  prior to  AVF surgery . 
 
Device:  
 The Fist Assist® [Figure 1 ] is a self -contained, miniaturized, wearable intermittent 
pneumatic compression device.  The small control unit is integrally attached to an 
inflatable cuff that is held to the upper extremity using a hook and loop attachment. 
Patients are able to apply and re move the device themselves using only the 
contralateral hand.  It is battery operated and has a single control to turn it on or off.  
All pressure and timing parameters are preset at the factory. The bladder is inflated to 
a pressure of 60 mmHg and held fo r 20 seconds then deflated to 10 mm Hg pressure 
for 55 seconds before the next inflation.  
 
  The Fist Assist® device applies 60 mmHg of compression to the limb, which 
shuts off after  20 seconds; the device cycles every 75 seconds. In comparison, when 
a blood pressure is measured as part of routine medical care, pressures of 160 -180 
mmHg are applied for approximately 45 -60 seconds, and a lymphedema garment 
applies unremitting pressure of 40 mm Hg to an arm for 8 -12 hours at a time.  
 
In recently published r esearch, The Fist Assist® device  was applied for six hours 
a day for 30 days to 43 patients with new radiocephalic and brachiocephalic AVF, 
starting one week after surgery. Acceptance of the device was excellent, and no 
patient suffered fistula thrombosis,  or reported pain, skin reactions, or bleeding from 
the AVF cannulation sites.42 In this initial pilot study, significant dilation of AVF outflow 
veins was demonstrated in patients using the Fist Assist® device, compared to control 
patients using a sham de vice (P <0.05).42-43 
 
 This first proposal of presurgery vein dilation outlines  important research that 
will help  to determine optimal roles of  the Fist Assist® device  in improving vascular 
access outcomes in patients receiving HD, by investigating the effects of the device 
used both before and after AVF surgery.  Early use of th is device could potentially allow 
for vein dilation  in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease , preparing vein s for 
AVF creation and improv ing primary AVF outcomes. Post -surgical use of the device  
may promote  further ve in dilation and  AVF maturation and reduce the need for 
secondary procedures to as sist maturation.  Investigation with this device may uncover 
a safe and noninvasive way to improve outcomes for ESRD patients , and provide 
important insight s into the biology of successful AVF maturation.  
 
Fist Assist Safety  Features : The device has many safety features to prevent patient 
complications. These include:  
6 
 1. Patient being able to remove it with ease as its velco and can be easily taken off  
2.  The device having incorporated firmware to  monitor the pressure to ensure it never 
goes over 60 mm Hg with auto -inflate and auto -vent features. This will ensure steady 
pressure at 60 mm Hg.  
3.  A battery monitoring system that ensures there is enough battery power to vent the 
balloon and turn off the device as the battery decreases  to a low level. As the battery 
deceases to low levels, the device will save enough power to ensure total balloon 
venting and shut down. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether  use of the Fist Assist® 
device facilitates vein dilation  before  AVF creation.  
Hypotheses :  
Use of the Fist Assist® before AVF creation will enhance superficial vein dilation, 
resulting in increased absolute vein diameters  at three months when compared to 
baseline values.   
SPECIFIC AIM:  
To determine whether  the use of the Fist Assist® device for  360 hours over 90 days by 
patients with advanced CKD prior to AVF  surgery results in significant  increase s in 
cephalic vein  diameter s prior to AVF surgery .  
SUBJECTS:  
Population:   
Inclusion criteria : Patients followed in the Nephrology Clinic  who are expected to 
initiate HD  will be approached for participation in the study . We will consider all patients 
with eGFR< 30 mL/min.1.73m2.39 Patients will be assigned to treatment with the Fist 
Assist®. 
 
Exclusion  criteria : Refusal /inability  to give  informed  consent, inability to comply with  
trial requirements , arm infection s, and skin disorders that requir e frequent medical 
attention.  In addition , we will exclude patients with obvious scarring from IV drug use 
or  previous phlebitis.  Patients will be excluded if they have previous occluded 
arteriovenous grafts or fistulae, arterial aneur ysms, or arm deep vein thrombosis or 
any previous vascular surgery on their non -dominant arm. Patients will be excluded 
they have limited cognitive ab ility. Patients will be excluded if they have any motor or 
sensory deficits in their upper arms.  
 Patients will have a preliminary evaluation of their cephalic vein, measured 5 cm 
proximal to the styloid process of the radius, and also at the antecubital fossa. Patients 
will be excluded if there are no detectable superficial veins of at least 1.0 mm diameter , 
and also if a superficial vein of more than 3.0 mm is present  in this lower arm location . 
LOCATION:  The study will be conducted in the Ambulatory C are facilities at the 
University of Chicago  Medical Center  (UCMC) .  
 
METHODOLOGY :   
7 
 Medical History:  Medical records of enrolled  patients  will be reviewed  to collect :  
date of birth, height, weight, ethnicity, and medical history related to factors which may 
affect vascular health , includ ing but not limited to : dialysis history, diabetes, 
hypertension, systemic lupus  erythromatosis , coronary artery disease , peripheral 
vascular disease , medication history, and any other  factors that contribute to vascular 
health.  
 
 
Intervention:   The Fist Assist® device will be assigned to each enrolled subject  by 
randomization code . All subject s will be asked to use the ir assigned  device twice daily, 
for two 2 -hour sessions, once in the morning and once in the evening . Patients will 
apply the device to the non-dominant arm above the level of the elbow, and to keep a 
written  log to record  use, complications and any problems .  
 
Blood  Draw s:  10 mL of b lood will be obtained from patients being enrolled  at the time 
of their next routine standard of care phlebotomy.These samples will be frozen for 
future assays of endothelial biomarkers of  nitric oxide production and venous dilation , 
such as asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) and its metabolites.  
Doppler:    Patients will undergo examination of their cephalic veins in the Nephrology  
Clinic , using a portable  vascular ultrasound d evice  operated  by a co -investig ator 
trained by  the UCMC  Vascular Lab in this technique . The cephalic vein , a superficial 
vein originating in the wrist , is the most common vein used for AVF creation. In order 
to standardize these measurements, t he diameter of the cephalic vein and vein wall 
thickness will be meas ured in both arms at : (a) 5 cm proximal to the styloid process of 
the radius ,  and (b) at the antecubital fossa . The diameter and thickness of the vein 
will be measured using a B -mode image acquired using a standard ultrasound 
machine with vascular probe g oing from outer walls per protocol. Patients will be 
seated with arms supported at the level of the heart on an exam table with in a room 
with a temperature of at least 20 degrees Celsius. A layer of at least 1 cm of gel will 
be applied locally to optimize  the ultrasound image quality.  Vascular Doppler 
measurements will be obtained on both arms at the time of consent (baseline), and at 
the conclusion of therapy. Measurements will be recorded.  
 
Follow Up : Those who are subsequently able to undergo successful AVF creation will 
be followed  clinically  for up to 12 months.  
Protocol:   Informed consent will be obtained by the co -investigators using a written 
consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board. After informed consent is 
obtained , patients will receive : physical exam ination  of both forearms; and a vascular 
Doppler  to determine cephalic vein diameter s of the nondomina nt arm.. A 10 mL blood 
sample  will be  drawn at the next routine phlebotomy .  
Patients will be asked to apply the Fist Assist® to the upper half of the non -dominant 
arm. Patients will be asked to use the device twice daily for two 2 -hour periods , and  
report any  complications  or problems, using a lo g (see log attached at end of 
References) . Patients will have follow up examinations with measurement of cephalic 
vein diameter at three months after enrollment . 
 
Outcomes :  The primary outcome will be the difference in vein diameter before and 
after Fist Assist® use. Secondary outcomes include : whether or not an AVF was 
creat ed (versus a synthetic graft or use of a central venous catheter ), whether the 
8 
 resultant vascular access matured sufficiently to be used for HD,  and the  subsequent  
exposure of patients to central venous catheters  during the ir first year of HD .  
  
9 
 DURATION OF STUDY :  All subjects will be enrolled and treated for three months. 
The duration of the study including data analysis and statistical analysis is expected 
to be 6 -9 months.

DATA MANAGEMENT : Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap 
electronic data capture tools hosted at The University of Chicago.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSE S:  The primary outcome of interest will be the difference in 
the diameter of the cephalic vein between baseline ( Pre) and 3 months  (Post) in 
patients treated with the Fist Assist® device . Based on prior work,  mean vein diameter s 
at baseline are anticipated to be approximately 1.8 mm with a standard deviation of 
0.5 mm ,44 and we anticipate  that the standard deviation of the change in diameter is 
likely to be approximately 0.75  mm.  
 
Effect = [(DSPost )-(DSPre)]  
 We would consider calculated effect size s of 0.25-1.0 mm to be clinically meaningful  
changes  that would increase the numbers of patients with  vein diameters that meet 
commonly accepted thresholds for sur gical suitability (normally 2.5 -3.0 mm). S ample 
size calculation s for a  variety of effects are presented in table  1 (below), based on 
paired t -tests with alpha error of 0.05 , standard deviation of the effect size of 0.75 mm, 
for power of 80% and 90%.

A secondary aim will be to  compare the proportions of treated patients who achieve 3 -
month vein diameters of 2.5 mm and 3.0 mm, to proportions achieved among controls.  
Given a normal distribution around a mean vein diameter of 1.8 mm with a standard 
deviation of 0.5 mm, the probabi lity of an untreated wrist vein exceeding 2.5 mm (or 
3.0 mm) would be 8.1% and 0.8%, respectively.  Given that the standard deviation of 
10 
 the diameter of treated veins  is at least  0.75, then the observed probabilities of a 
treated vein exceeding either 2.5 mm or 3.0 mm can be calculated, and is shown  in 
the table below, any of which could be shown to be a significantly different proportion 
from the baseline state. The sample sizes required to demonstrate a difference in 
proportions were calculated using a McNemar test of paired proportions, with the very 
conservative assumption that 10% of veins that are adequate on preliminary 
measurement may fall below the cut -off value, due to variation in measurements .

We intend to study 90 patients , and anticipate effect s which shou ld be more than 
adequate for the se purpose s. 
POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS :  The benefit to the subjects will 
be that this research could identify interventions that are more likely to result in 
vascular access patency. The primary risk is that patients may find the device irritating 
or annoying to wear.   The patients will be gi ven a 90 day log with check box es to 
determine if any complications occur (see attached log at end of references).  All 
patients enrolled will give  informed consent about the study and device to ensure their 
full understanding and participati on.  
PAYMENT TO  THE SUBJECT :  The subject will not incur any cost as a result of 
participating in the study. The subject will not receive payment for participation in the 
study. No advertisement will be used to recruit subjects.  
PROCESS OF CONSENT:  The patient will give  informed written consent approved 
by the IRB prior to participation.  
CONFIDENTIALITY: All records will be kept confidential.  The subjects will be 
assigned an identification number prior to entering any information into the computer 
database.  Only study  personnel will have access to the database.  All forms will be 
stored and locked in the primary investigator 's office immediately.  Data will not be 
shared outside of the University of Chicago.

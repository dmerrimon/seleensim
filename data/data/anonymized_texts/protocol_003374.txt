Aging and Speech Perception in Complex Listening Environments[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]2/28/2022
Study objectivesThe goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of, and benefits provided by, several over -the-counter, direct-to-consumer hearing devices. Specifically we were interested in assessing the benefits of these devices for middle-age people with no more than mild hearing loss. While some literature already exists on the effectiveness of devices of this type (Reed et al 2017, Cho et al 2019, Seol et al 2021, among others), these are primarily studies of individuals with greater degrees of hearing loss. Additionally, the goal of this study was to assess both the objective benefit of the devices, in terms of performance on a speech perception task, and to quantify subjective benefit in terms of self-rated listening effort while using the devices. The study assesses four specific devices: Sound World Solutions CS50+, Nuheara IQ Buds, Tweak Focus, and Bose Hearphones. These four devices are all specifically classified as Personal Amplification Products, or PSAPs. Participants were randomly assigned to use one of these four devices during the study.Study methods and proceduresThe study consisted of three parts: intake procedures, where participants were given consent forms, performed cognitive and hearing assessments, and were fitted for the PSAP to which they were assigned; a speech perception task; and a brief post-test survey.As part of the intake procedures, subjects completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nasreddine et al., 2005), after which audiometry and tympanometry were completed, and the subjects were fitted with a PSAP. Subjects were fitted binaurally, with suitable dome sizes and wire length selected to ensure an appropriate physical fit. Subjects assigned to the IQ Buds or CS50+ then performed an in-situ hearing test using the device’s smartphone app.  All devices were set to directionalmicrophone mode (called ‘focus’, ‘noisy’, ‘restaurant’, and ‘focused’ for the IQ Buds, Tweak Focus, CS50+ and Hearphones, respectively) for the remainder of the time they were worn.Verification of each PSAP was performed with the Audioscan Verifit 2 Speechmap system usingan on-ear probe microphone to measure output.  The International Speech Test Signal (ISTS) was used to obtain real-ear unaided responses (REUR) for 50 dB SPL input, followed by aided responses at 50 dB SPL and 65 dB SPL.  The output of each device was adjusted so that the long-term average speech spectrum of the ISTS would approximate National Acoustic Laboratories Non-Linear 2 (NAL-NL2) targets within +/- 5 dB SPL where possible.  For devices with limited fine-tuning ability, targets in the 1kHz – 2 kHz range were given preference.  To confirm loudness comfort, swept tones were presented from 0.25 – 8 kHz at 85 dB SPL, followed by pink noise at 80 dB SPL.  Participants rated the above stimuli on a 7-point loudness scale (7 = uncomfortably loud).  If participants rated either loudness test as a 7, gain was reduced and the loudness test was repeated until a comfortable loudness level was reached.  In cases where gain was reduced following the loudness comfort test, aided responses to ISTSwere re-measured with the final device settings to be used in the speech perception task.  In the speech perception task, subjects were played a series of sentences and instructed to repeatthem back verbatim. The sentences were all taken from the same corpus, developed by Helfer, Merchant, and Freyman (2016). Sentences in this corpus all have the same syntactic structure: Name found the color noun and the adjective noun here (with the five underlined words denoting the target words which varied across sentences). A sample sentence is Theo found the pink menu and the true itemhere. All sentences were recorded from a female speaker. The subjects performed the task once while using a PSAP (aided) and once without (unaided), with different sets of sentences. Half of the 
participants in each device group began with the unaided test block, and half with the aided; this factor was randomized within each device group. Their responses were audio-recorded and analyzed and scored off-line.Subjects performed the task in a sound booth with three loudspeakers. Target sentences were played from a loudspeaker located directly in front of the participant and maskers were played from loudspeakers located 60 degrees to the right and left. Maskers were either speech-shaped steady-state noise (SSN), speech-shaped envelope-modulated noise (SEM), or sentences from the same corpus as the stimuli, also spoken by other female talkers. Masking sentences began at a random point in the sentence, with the beginning of the sentence appended to the end, in order to assist participants in segregating the target sentence (which always began with Theo, Victor, or Michael) from the masking sentences. Target presentation level and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were both varied as well: target sentences were presented at either 50 decibels A or 65 decibels A, and maskers were presented at levelscorresponding to 0 decibels SNR and -6 decibels SNR.Nine sentences (45 target scoring words) occurred in each of twelve auditory conditions (3 masker types by 2 presentation levels by 2 SNRs), all randomized within each block (aided vs. unaided), making 216 sentences across 24 total conditions. In addition, before each block, subjects were given 12 practice trials (four with each masker type) to become accustomed to doing the task withor without the device. Subjects were scored on the speech perception task in terms of percentage of correct target words accurately repeated in each condition.At the end of each of the two blocks, subjects were asked to indicate how much effort they needed to expend to complete the task on a scale of 1 (very little effort) to 10 (a great deal of effort). Participants also completed a brief survey after the speech perception task. This survey asked them to indicate the extent to which participants thought the device would be helpful in the real world; how willing they would be to use the device in the real world; whether they would recommend the device to others; and how comfortable they found wearing the device.Statistical Analysis PlanDependent variables to be analyzed are performance on the speech perception task, benefit of use of the device, and self-rated listening effort. Performance will be measured as percent of target words accurately repeated; benefit will be measured as percent correct with device minus percent correct without device. Listening effort will be measured on ten-point scale (10 being the greatest effort, 1 the least).Between-subjects variables to be measured are device (ie., which of the four devices the participant used), age, and hearing loss (better-ear Pure Tone Average). Within-subject independent variables to be analyzed are device condition (i.e., with vs. without device) and acoustic properties of the stimuli: presentation level of target sentences (soft vs. loud), type of masking noise (SEM noise, SSN noise, or competing speech maskers), and signal-to-noise ratio (-6 dB or 0 dB).Statistical analysis will be done with separate Repeated Measures ANOV As for Performance, Benefit, and Self-Rated Effort. Responses to the post-experiment questionnaire will be analyzed qualitatively.ReferencesCho, Y .S., Park, S.Y ., Seol, H.Y ., Lim, J.H., Cho, Y .S., Hong, S.H., & Moon, I.J. (2019).

The results may be published in a scientific journal and/or presented at a scientific conference.   4. WHERE WILL THE STUDY TAKE PLACE AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?  The study will take place in the Hearing Research Laboratory in Arnold House at the University of Massachusetts. You will be required to come for one or two visits of approximately 2 hours.   5. WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO?  You will first have your hearing tested and then you will be counseled about the results. Based on the hearing test results, you may be excluded from the study. If this is the case, you will receive a $10 stipend. Next, you will complete two questionnaires asking about your health and your hearing, as well as a brief cognitive screening test. During the remainder of your participation you will complete tests of speech understanding in which you must listen for one message when there are distracting sounds playing

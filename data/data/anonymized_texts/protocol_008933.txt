Study Design This is a global, Phase 1/2 multicenter, open -label, safety and dose escalation study 
of BAX 888 in adult subjects with severe hemophilia A. Up to 12 subjects may be 
administered BAX 888 in up to 3 dose cohorts.
Study Procedures
Before any study -related procedures are follow ed, subjects will provide signed 
informed consenti. During the course of the study, FVIII activity levels will be 
assessed by a central laboratory (both one -stage and chromogenic assays) and by 
the local laboratory (either one -stage or chromogenic assay) as specified in 
Table 3. How ever, only central labo ratory FVIII activity level s derived from the 
one-stage assay will be utilized for the primary analysis. FVIII activity level s 
obtained from the central laboratory chromogenic assay will be utilized to support 
the one- stage assay results. Baseline FVIII ac tivity levels will be assessed by the 
central laboratory one -stage clotting assay at the Screen 1 visit. Upon completion 
of screening activities, on the day of BAX 888 dosing (Day 0)ii, subjects will be 
admitted to the infusion centeriii. 
BAX 888 will be adm inistered as a single peripheral IV infusion on Day 0. 
Subjects will be evaluated at the infusion center for the first 8 hours post -BAX888 
infusion (and up to 24 hours at the discretion of the investigator), and for the Day 1 visit. The subject will then be evaluated at the hemophilia treatment center at 
Weeks 1 and 2 (once weekly), Weeks 3 to 14 (twice weekly, w ith separate clinic 
visit and laboratory visit each week), Week s15to 18 (once weekly), and at 
Months 5, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 , 36, 48, and 60. To assess long -term safety 
(adverse events [ AEs] ) and efficacy (FVIII activity levels, bleeding episodes, 
FVIII consumption) subjects will continue to be followed every 4 months through 
Years 2 and 3, and annually on Years4 and 5.
Blood samples and urine for clinical safety evaluations will be collected and FVIII activity will be collected as an efficacy -related parameter to support future clinical 
iSubjects will initially provide consent for the Screen 1 visit. Subjects who pass Screen 1 will then provide consent 
for the second screening visit and all subsequent study visits at the Screen 2 visit.
iiIf the infusion center is not the subject’s Hemophilia Treatment Center/local investigator’s institution, a second separate consent will be obtained from the subject for the Day 0 visit and for all procedures surrounding the 
infusion period.

development. Electrocardiograms will be obtained, and vital signs will be 
monitored f requently over the first 8 hours following BAX 888 infusion. Blood and 
bodily secretions (saliva, semen, urine, and stool) w ill be obtained to assess 
BAX 888 genomes until 2 consecutive measurements are negative.
In addition to a safety data review  by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), 
further analyses on efficacy and safety data may be performed at study milestones (eg, when the initial tw o subjects in the first cohort finish the Week 18 visit), or 
otherwise up to tw ice a year for the duration of the stu dy. Analyses due to different 
trigger points may be waived or combined for efficiency.
Clinical bleeding episodes will be managed w ith infusion of exogenous FVIII. 
Usage of exogenous FVIII for prevention (prophylactic treatment) or episodic 
management (on -demand treatment) of hemorrhages will be at the discretion of the 
investigator and/or local hemophilia physician, and in consultation with the study subject. How ever, in order to measure FVIII activity that is derived from the BAX 
888 transgene and not exo genous FVIII products, subjects will be asked to refrain 
from prophylactic FVIII usage between Weeks 3 to 18 after BAX 888 
administration and during the 3 weeks prior to the Month 9 visit. During these 
periods which are critical for the assessment of susta ined FVIII activity levels from 
the vector (as both an efficacy and safety evaluation), on -demand treatment that is 
required for clinical bleeding should, if possible, be performed using a standard half-life FVIII product (rather than an extended half -lifeFVIII concentrate). 
Whenever possible, a 3 -to 5-day wash-out period should be observed prior to any 
study visit with a FVIII activity level assessment, however, scheduled visits ( except 
forScreen 1) should not be missed in the case of a wash -out of less than 3 days. 
Dose Escalation
At study initiation, subjects will be assigned to a dose cohort, w ith a minimum of 
24hours betw een dosing of each subject. Initially, 2 subjects w ill be dosed in a 
cohort, w ith up to a total of 5 subjects if the cohort is expanded. Safety and FVIII 
activity level data from subjects dosed w ith BAX 888 w ill be utilized to make 
decisions on dose escalation and cohort expansion. Rules for cohort expansion and dose escalation are provided below . However, if any subject in a given cohort 
achieves >50% FVIII activity levels at Week 14, the DMC will provide a recommendation on further dose escalations after review of all safety and FVIII activity level data
iv. Ifany subject in any cohort achieves ≥150% FVIII activity 
levels at any time while on the study, further dosing will be paused until DMC 
review. Baseline FVIII activity level is defined as the value obtained based on the central laboratory one -stage FVIII assay.
ivDMC recommendations will be based on, but not limited to, the following considerations: (1) mean, median, and 
range of FVIII activity levels (central lab, one -stage clotting assay) observed within the dosing cohort, (2) 
variability in response between subjects, (3) liver function tests, and (4) other product -related adverse events

Only central laboratory one- stage FVIII activity level s will be cons idered for dose 
escalation or cohort expansion decisions.
Subjects within the same dose cohort w ill be infused with BAX 888 no less than 
24hours apart to ensure sufficient time is given to observe for infusion -related 
hypersensitivity reactions prior to d osing the next subject. Since asymptomatic 
liver inflammation has not been observed in any individuals who have not 
expressed FIX or FVIII in the AAV hemophilia gene therapy trials, hence dosing of subjects after dose escalation can occur as early as 4 w eeks in the absence of 
FVIII expression in the lower dose subjects.

Alternatively, if FVIII activity levels (≥2%) are observed in at least 1 subject, 
the decision to escalate dose or expand the cohort will be based on all data 
available through Week 14.

study:
Continue to expand Cohort 2 up to 5 subjects
Escalation to Cohort 3 (1.2 × 1013cp/kg) 
Com pletion of study enrollment with no further dosing
Preliminary evaluation following 2 subjects dosed with 2.0 × 1012cp/kg (low est 
dose level) showed minimal impact on FVIII activity levels . Preliminary 
evaluat ion following 2 subjects dosed 6.0 × 1012cp/kg (middle dose level; 3 -fold 
higher than lowest dose level) suggests that the peak FVIII activity was as expected but increased more than proportional to the increase in dose. A mouse model suggested a potentia l non -linear dose -FVIII activity relationship (doubling 
of the dose might produce more than a doubling of the FVIII activity). To ensure informed dose escalation in subjects with Hemophilia A, instead of a 3 -fold 
increase in dose, the next proposed dose is 1.2 ×10

Immunosu ppression
Vector -derived factor expression followed by a decrease in factor levels has been 
observed in previous hemophilia gene therapy trials and has been attributed to an immune response directed against the successfully transduced cells. To address this issue and to ensure sustained factor levels are achieved, BAX 888 has been 
engineered to have a reduced prospect of eliciting an immune response.
Nevertheless, a prophylactic course of glucocorticosteroid treatment 
with prednisolone (as shown in the tabl e below ) will be employed starting at Day 8 
post-BAX 888 infusion. 
The follow ing dosing schedule w ill be follow ed as a guideline. The corticosteroid 
regimen may be adjusted at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with 
the Sponsor Medical Mon itor depending on the subject’s tolerance of the 
regimen andthe observed hepatic transaminase response. 
Subjects receiving corticosteroids may require additional unscheduled visits to evaluate potential side effects of corticosteroid therapy and for cort icosteroid dose 
adjustments, FVIII activity levels and liver function tests (LFTs) w ill be measured

NOTE: In geographies where prednisolone cannot be sourced at the strengths 
required for the specified dosing regimen ( egUSA), prednisone will be provided. 
Prednisone is converted to the active metabolite prednisolone and is recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and the European Association for the Stu dy of the Liver (EASL) for the treatment of 
autoimmune hepatitis.
Assessment of possible reactions to corticosteroids will be performed by the 
Investigator and modification of treatment will be done as necessary after consultation with the Sponsor’s Medica l Monitor. In such instances, consideration 
should be given to combination therapy with azathioprine/corticosteroid per AASLD guidelines or other drug as per standard of practice, in consultation with a 
hepatologist, so that the care can be individualized to the subject’s needs.
Further Managem ent of Presumptive Vector- Related Hepatitis
Any subject who develops an ALT and/or or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
level >3 × upper limit of normal ( ULN )during the study will continue to be treated 
with prednisol onevias outlined in the Prednisolone Dosing Regimen Table above 
in the Immunosuppression Section. Additionally, the subject must have 
thetestrepeated and confirmed w ithin 72 hours. If the level remains > 3 ×ULN, a 
diagnostic workup of potential infectious and toxic/metabolic causes of hepatitis will be pursued, including consultation with a hepatologist. If no other cause of the 
elevated ALT and/or AST is identified, consideration should be given to

Investigator serum a lpha fetoprotein level, an exploratory biomarker for 
hepatocellular carcinoma, willbe measured at local laborator ies.
Study Stopping Rules
Each subject will receive only 1 dose of BAX 888 during the course of the study; hence study stopping rules apply only to subjects during the screening period. Subjects who have been dosed w ith BAX 888 w ill be followed to the end of the 
study as per protocol.
If any one of the following criteria are met, dosing will be paused and further 
enrollment will be halted until an independent DMC evaluates all available study data and makes a recommendation:
viIn geographies where prednisolone cannot be sourced at the strengths required for the specified dosing regimen 
(eg, USA), prednisone will be provided. Prednisone is converted to the active metabolite prednisolone , and is 
recommended by the AASLD and the EASL for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis.For performed locally to assess liver health.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sample Size Calculation
The sample size is expected to range from 2 to 12 evaluable subjects depending on the actual number of cohorts 
and the actual number of subjects in each cohort. This sample size was chosen to provide sufficient evidence of 
safety and exploration of signs of efficacy for this indication and is not based on formal statistical considerations.
Planned Statistical Analysis
In general, descriptive summaries will be presented for the primary, secondary, and tertiary outcome measures. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, median, and other percentiles as appropriate. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Analyses will be performed within each cohort separately and overall. The primary outcom e of the 
incidence of BAX 888 -related AEs will be analyzed as a categorical variable. An exploratory, descriptive 
analysis will also be performed for events categorized as development of inhibitory antibodies to FVIII and total 
binding antibodies to FVIII, severe allergic reactions, an d thrombosis -associated events. More detailed 
information about summarization of data, graphical representations, and analysis conventions will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.For The sample size is expected to range from 2 to 12 For The sample size is expected to range from 2 to 12 For non-commercial congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous 6

5.BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
5.1 Description of Investigational Product
The investigational product (I P), BAX 888, is a gene therapy  product engineered to induce the 
production of human factor VIII (FVIII) protein in the liver cells of individuals with severe 
congenital FVIII deficiency. The BAX 888 drug product is based on an adeno-associated virus, seroty pe 8 (AAV8) vector expressing a functional human B-domain deleted, codon- optimized
FVIII protein. The wild type AAV upon which the recombinant AAV vector is based is a non-pathogenic, replication defective dependoparvovirus, which is not associated with human disease. During the manufacture of recombinant AAV gene delivery  vectors, all viral genes are 
removed such that the only protein-coding DNA sequence that is delivered in the BAX 888 vector is the FVIII gene along with DNA elements required for expression of the potentially therapeutic F8 gene. The rationale for the choice of the serotype of 8 for the BAX 888 capsid is 
that, among the naturall y occurring AAV serot ypes, AAV8 is particularl y efficient at infecting 
and directing gene expression in the human liver, with minimal “off-target” gene expression in other tissues ( eg, in antigen presenting cells). In addition, BAX 888 incorporates a hepatocy te 
specific promoter to further restrict FVIII expression to the target liver tissue.
BAX 888 is intended to be given as a single, one- time intravenous (IV) infusion by  a health care 
provider, at a qualified Center. If successful transduction of hepatocytes is achieved, long -term 
hepatic expression and secretion of endogenous FVIII into the blood stream may support 
hemostasis and in turn eliminate or reduce the prophylactic and/or on- demand use of exogenous 
FVIII concentrate therapy in hemophilia A patients. For the initial Phase 1/2 clinical study, BAX 888 will be supplied as a 5 mL or 10 mL frozen, sterile, non- pyrogenic solution intended 
for IV infusion, and dosing will be based on the subjec t’s body  weight. The current safety  study
will include investigation of the proposed doses of 2.0 × 10
12cp/kg (lowest BAX 888 dose 
predicted to provide FVIII expression), 6.0 × 1012cp/kg and a further dose of 1.2 × 1013cp/kg 
(see proposed dose escalation scheme in Figure 3). A single dose based on observed therapeutic 
durability  is to be determined from this Phase 1/2 study  for further evaluation in future clinical 
studies.
See Section 5.4for further information on BAX 888 and its usage in this study. A detailed 
description of BAX 888 is also provided in the BAX 888 Investigator’s Brochure (IB).The study  design is in compliance with the EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 guidelines for the

5.2 Clinical Condition/Indication
Hemophilia A is a rare congenital disease characterized by reduced or absent levels of the 
coagulation FVIII. It occurs in approximately  1 in 5,000 live male births. FVIII is encoded b y 
F8, a large gene (186 kb) that is found in the most distal band (Xq28) of the long arm of the 
X chromosome. Thus, females are carriers of the disease, which almost exclusively affects males through inheritance from the maternal side. Mutations of the FVIII gene result in a congenital deficiency  or defect in FVIII, a crucial factor in blood coagulation. In the absence of functional 
FVIII, the coagulation cascade is severely impaired resulting in a bleeding disorder, the severity of which is dependent on the residual endogenous levels of FVIII.
Severity  of hemophilia is ty pical ly categorized as follows:
Severe hemophilia: FVIII activity levels <1% of normal FVIII activity .
Moderate hemophilia: FVIII activity levels ≥1 to 5% of normal FVIII activity .
Mild hemophilia: FVIII activity levels >5 to <40% of normal FVIII activity.
Hemophilia A is characterized by eas y bruising in earl y childhood, spontaneous bleeding 
(particularl y into joints, musculoskeletal tissues, and other soft tissues causing significant pain, 
and permanent damage if left untreated), and excessive bleeding fol lowing trauma or surgery .
Current standard of care management of hemophilia A is to treat mainly  by replacement of FVIII 
using proph ylactic or on-demand regimens to control bleeding episodes, and ultimately  to 
prevent joint damage and death in severe cases. For long- term prophy laxis against bleeding in 
patients with severe hemophilia A, the usual replacement doses are 30 to 40 IU of FVIII per kg 
body  weight at intervals of 2 to 3 day s. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of 
FVIII per kg bod y weight 3 to 4 times weekly  are recommended.
In comparison to the current treatment modalities, gene transfer in hemophilia A holds 
substantial promise in that it is considered to be a one- time intervention that is potentially
curative. This intervention may lead to complete avoidance of the need for IV infusions and their 
side effects and, ultimately , would be life-changing for patients affected with this condition.
5.3 Population to be Studied
The target population for this Phase 1/2 first- in-human study is male subjects, aged 18 to 
75years inclusive, with severe hemophilia A, as evidenced b y a FV III:C level <1% following 
≥5days without FVIII treatment, and documented evidence of ≥3 hemorrhages over the previous 
12 months requiring treatment with exogenous FVIII or use of FVIII prophy laxis due to a history
of frequent bleeding episodes. All subjects will have previousl y been treated with exogenously 
administered FVIII concentrates or cry oprecipitate for >150 documented exposure day s.For patients with severe hemophilia A, the usual replacement doses are 30

Subjects with a detectable FVIII inhibitor with a titer ≥0.6 Bethesda units (BU) at the time of 
screening or well documented personal laboratory evidence of a FVIII inhibitor with a titer ≥0.6 BU will not be eligible. Similarly, subjects with an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other than hemophilia A and subjects with chronic hepatic d ysfunction or severe renal 
impairment will not be eligible to participate. See Section 8.2.
5.4 Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
5.4.1 Nonclinical Studies
Nonclinical dose response and toxicology studies have been completed. Data from these and 
additional nonclinical studies can be found in the BAX 888 IB.
5.4.2 Clinical Studies
No prior studies of BAX 888 in humans have been performed.
5.5 Evaluation of the Unmet Medical Need in the Treatment of Severe Hemophilia A
Current standard of care therapy for severe hemophilia A consisting of continuous repeated 
prophy lactic infusions of FVIII concentrates is effective in controlling most hemorrhages and 
slowing or preventing the development of hemophilic arthropath y and other chronic 
complications of bleeding. Major limitations to continuous prophylactic FVIII therap y include 
the painful and time- consuming nature of repeated IV therap y and the continuous need for access 
to clotting factor concentrate and infusion supplies, which are associated with poor adherence. A recent anal ysis of 4899 adult men with severe hemophilia in the United States multidis ciplinary
Hemophilia Treatment Center Network demonstrated that regular proph ylactic clotting factor 
infusion was performed by  less than 30% of participants (including less than 50% of men with 
severe hemophilia less than 30 y ears of age) (Mazepa et al., 2016) . Despite relativel y good 
access to clotting factor concentrates in the United States and other resource-rich countries (~75% of men across all age groups in this anal ysis practiced home infusion of factor 
concentrates) 39% reported having very frequent joint bleeding (≥5 joint bleeds per six month period) and 36% reported limitations of school/work and activities of dail y living as a result of 
joint bleeding (Mazepa et al., 2016) .
5.5.1 Evaluation of Anticipated Benefits and Risks of AAV-FVIII Gene Therapy
Rigorous efforts to decrease the burden and improve the care of the disease by prolonging the 
circulating half-life of infused FVIII concentrate have resulted in only modest improvements (<1.5 times prolongation of FVIII half-life). Since even a modest increase in the level of missing FVIII can ameliorate the severe bleeding phenot ype, it is anticipated that the successful 
development of a hemophilia A gene therapy product would lead to continuous endogenous expression of FVIII and would address man y of the current treatment limitations by  achieving 
greater than 1% of circulating FVIII activity at all times. For  less than 30% of participants (including less than 50% of men with

Such an endpoint, if achievable, could convert the severe bleeding phenot ype to that of moderate 
or mild hemophilia (which is the goal of FVIII prophyl axis).
Adherence to repeated venipuncture and infusions would not be needed to achieve this clinical 
goal if gene transfer is successful, wherein the goal is for the disease to be cured with a single 
intervention that effects durable gene expression.
The IPBAX 888 has not been tested in humans previously . The primary  objective of the current 
study  is to evaluate safety  and to determine a dose of BAX 888 that may  lead to levels of FVIII 
expression that have been associated with freedom from spontaneous joint hemorrhage. As with 
all Phase 1 trials, there is not an expectation that study subjects will receive benefit, although participation is expected to provide benefit in further directing the development of BAX 888 hemophilia gene therap y. BAX 888 doses for the current Phase 1/2 trial have been chosen based 
upon preclinical research suggesting that all of the chosen doses may lead to FVIII expression; however, there is no prior experience with BAX 888 in humans. For this same reason, if a single injection of BAX 888 directs FVIII expression in humans, the anticipated length of persistence of expression following a single injection of BAX 888 in humans is currently  not known. The 
AAV8 vector is predominantly  a non -integrating virus, and so there is a potential for the loss of 
the episomally  maintained AAV vector genomes with division of the transduced cells, which 
would result in a loss of expression of the therapeutic transgene over time. Targeting clotting factor expression to post- mitotic hepatocytes with a low cellular turnover rate may  minimize 
dilutional effects resulting from new hepatocyte generation (Kattenhorn et al., 2016) . AAV8 
vectors expressing clotting factors have led to expression for greater than 10 years (and counting) in large animals and greater than 6 years (and counting) in one human trial (Nienhuis et al., 2016 ).
The long-term safety of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors in humans is unknown; however, 
AAV vectors have been delivered to several hundred human subjects to date, in trials for cy stic 
fibrosis, α1- antitry psin deficiency , rheumatoid arthritis, congestive hear t failure, lipoprotein 
lipase deficiency , as well as hemophilia, and have been remarkabl y free of vector- related adverse 
events (AE). 
Several clinical trials have used naturally  occurring or engineered AAV seroty pe vectors to 
achieve expression of FVIII or Factor IX (FIX). The chief risk that has been observed in human 
clinical trials using s ystemic delivery  of AAV vectors is that the subject’s immune system 
recognizes the AAV as an infectious agent and raises humoral (antibod y-mediated) and 
potentially  cell-mediated immune responses against the vector.For in large animals and greater than 6

Wild -type AAV (WT AAV), the parent virus upon which rAAV vectors are based, is 
non-pathogenic, resulting in a milder immune response than would be expected for a pathogenic 
virus. I n addition, WT AAV is replication-defective and cannot produce an active infection 
without the coincident infection of a helper virus. Recombinant AAVs are further rendered non-pathogenic b y having all of the gene sequences of WT AAV removed, resulting in 
extremely  low environmental risk related to rAAV viral shedding ( Baldo et al., 2013 ). 
Nevertheless, at doses of rAAV gene therapy  vectors used clinically, it is anticipated that all 
subjects will develop neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the capsid serotype. Although development of AAV- specific NAbs is not associated with any  symptoms or AEs, these 
antibodies would persist for years and prevent the repeat treatment with the same AAV vector until they  are naturally  cleared. Furthermore, the AAV serot ype-specific NAbs may  or may  not 
also cross -neutralize rAAV made using alternative AAV serotypes and diminish th eir efficiency . 
This consideration is relevant since the expected persistence of expression from a single injection of BAX 888 is currently  unknown.
In addition to the humoral response described above, a clinical laboratorycomplication of asymptomatic liv er transaminase elevation (in particular the relativel y 
liver-specific alanine aminotransferase – ALT) has been documented in some subjects onmultiple hemophilia gene therapy and other AAV liver -directed gene therapy  trials

The loss of FIX expression could be demonstrated in some subjects to be associated with the expansion of AAV capsid-specific T effector l ymphocy tes in the peripheral blood, resulting in 
inflammatory signaling targeting the AAV transduced hepatocy tes. This has been further noted 
clinically  by observations of vector dose-dependent elevations of liver transaminase (serum

Itremains unknown whether the capsid-directed immune response is the initiating phenomenon 
that leads to the loss of gene expression or whether other mechanisms are primary  with the T cell 
signaling being a secondary  phenomenon. Inseveral oftheclinical studies, the observed 
transaminitis and/or decrease in FIX levels was treated with weeks to months of high, tapering 
dose corticosteroids (prednisone / prednisolone), which have a broad but not T cell specific immunosuppressive action. Corticosteroid therap y has in general been associated with 
normalizing liver transaminase levels, and in some (although not all) trials, with maintenance of some level of clotting factor activity.
Besides the primary  T-cell mediated immune responses, innate immune responses to rAAV 
infection have been described in the preclinical setting. However, such responses have rarel y 
been detected s ystemically in human clinical studies.
Preliminary  results from an ongoing clinical study using the AAV5 vector to deliver the 
B-domain deleted (BDD) FVIII gene were recently  published ( Rangarajan et al., 2017 ). Six of 
seven subjects treated with high doses of rAAV5 BDD FVIII were reported to be expressing 
FVIII at normal or supernormal levels with at least 34 weeks of follow-up, with a seventh subject expressing FVIII at 15%. Although chronic expression of FVIII at >150% activity  carries an 
increased relative risk of thrombosis, no thromboses have been reported in this or any other trial of AAV- directed gene therapy  for hemophilia. Following elevation of ALT in the first high dose 
subject in the hemophilia A trial, all subsequent subjects were treated with prophy lactic 
corticosteroids. The utility of proph ylactic corticosteroids was not demonstrated in this trial, 
however, as all subjects developed mild transaminitis in the 1- 2X normal range (ie ,in the same 
range as the high dose individual who did not receive proph ylactic corticosteroids, but instead 
received corticosteroid dosing only after developing transaminase elevation). Following prolonged taper of corticosteroids, the ALT levels of the seven subjects are reportedl y at or near 
normal levels. The sponsors of this single stud y of AAV gene therap y for hemophilia A have 
concluded that proph ylactic corticosteroids will not be used with future dosing.
Neutralizing antibodies (“inhibitors”) to FIX or FVIII have not developed in any  AAV -directed 
trial of gene therapy for hemophilia. The specific concern that expression of FVIII after AAV gene transfer to hepatocytes might promote cellular stress via activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) has r ecently  been examined in a preclinical model, and a dose-dependent UPR 
could not be demonstrated, nor any negative effect upon liver pathology or FVIII immunogenicit y (Zolotukhin et al., 2016 ). Moreover, data from large and small animal disease 
models suggests that liver-mediated expression of potential ly immunogenic antigens, in the 
context of gene transfer, can mitigate the immune response to the transgenic protein, mediated in part by  the induction of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory  T cells (Crudele et al., 2015 ;Perrin et 
al., 2016 ).For range as the high dose individual who did not receive proph

5.5.1.1 Prednisolone
Prednisolone is a highl y potent glucocorticoid steroid having anti- inflammatory  and 
immunosuppressive activity, as well as anti-proliferative, vasoactive, hormonal and metabolic 
effects qualitatively  similar to those of hy drocortisone ( Czaja and Manns, 2010; Liu et al., 2013) . 
The anti -inflammatory  and immunosuppressive properties of glucocorticosteroids result from 
upregulating the transcription of anti- inflammatory genes or b y downregulating the 
transcription of inflammatory  genes, leading to changes in downstream production of 
cytokine/chemokine proteins that initiate or maintain inflammation. Prednisolone, which is the 
active metabolite of prednisone, modifies the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli including autoimmune processes. Taking this into consideration, the American Association for the Study  of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommendations for the treatment of autoimmune 
hepatitis, for example , specify  a starting dose and tapering approach using the corticosteroid 
prednisone as a single agent (Manns et al., 2010 ;Soloway  et al., 1972 ), while the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines allow initiation of therapy with either prednisone or prednisolone (given at identical to tal dose) ( European Association for the Study  of 
the L iver, 2015 ).
Prednisolone toxicity  is related to both the dose and cumulative duration of its use. For most 
prednisolone- relate d AEs, a precise threshold dose or duration of treatment is not established. 
Despite the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids, and the very common clinical use of prednisolone in a variety of disorders, the use of these agents (in particular long- term sy stemic 
use) is associated with a great variet y of well -recognized adverse events, including: low bone 
mineral density; osteonecrosis; adrenal suppression; hy pergl ycemia and diabetes; cardiovascular 
disease and lipid d ysregulation; sleep and psy chiatric dist urbances; and immune suppression 
(Liu et al., 2013 ).
NOTE: In geographies where prednisolone cannot be sourced at the strengths required forthe 
specified dosing regimen (eg, USA), prednisone will be utilized. Prednisone is converted to the active metabolite prednisolone in the liver and is recommended b y the AASL D and the EASL 
for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis.
5.5.1.2 Evaluation of Anticipated Benefits and Risks of Co- admini stration of Prednisolone 
and AAV
The BAX 888 vector design incorporates a single-stranded genome structure and an efficient 
codon optimization which greatly reduces the content of CpG repeats. These features minimize the appearance of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) so as to minimize potential

The protocol includes a prophylactic course of corticosteroids. As seen in prior AAV hemophilia 
gene therap y trials, subjects may demonstrate clotting fa ctor expression followed by  an apparent 
cytotoxic ly mphocy te (CTL ) response against transduced hepatocy tes. The rationale to use 
corticosteroids in an attempt to prevent the course of the apparent CTL response includes 1) to maintain the health of the gene-transduced liver and 2) to rescue transgenic clotting factor expression, with the understanding that rescue (if possible) of even modest amounts of sustained circulating factor activity is expected to improve the severe bleeding phenoty pe and that repeat 
administration of the same gene therapy vector will not be possible due to expected development of high titer and long-lived AAV NAb. The rAAV- associated liver inflammation has in most 
individuals resolved rapidly  (ie, within 2 weeks) (Nathwani et al., 2014 )with the institution of 
high dose corticosteroid therap y, followed b y taper over 8 -12 weeks. What has varied between 
individuals enrolled in three different AAV hemophilia B gene therap y trials is that the degree to 
which the supportive institution of corticosteroids has been associated with sustained clotting factor expression has varied from 0% to 100%.
Utilization of supportive corticosteroid treatment to interrupt ongoing transaminitis/loss of factor 
activity  involves an initial sy stemic high dose of prednisolone followed b y a conservative taper 
over 5 to 8 weeks, patterned after the guidelines of the AASLD and the EASL for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis (Nathwani et al., 2014 ;Manns et al., 2010 ;Soloway  et al., 1972 ). 
Chronic use of s ystemic steroids at doses of ≥5 mg daily is associated with a wide variety of 
AEs, although the risk for many of these AEs increases particularl y with continuous use for 
greater than 3 -6months. Should subjects receive a course of prednisolone therapy of <3 months 
(per protocol) the most important risks include: low bone mineral densit y (osteoporosis), 
osteonecrosis, adrenal suppression, hy pergl ycemia and diabetes; sleep and psychiatric 
disturbances. Loss of bone mineral densit y ma y occur with the planned doses, although in a 
meta- analysis of adult patients, the fracture risk rose with duration of therapy  of 3 to 6 months or 
longer (Liu et al., 2013 ;van Staa et al., 2002 ). Nevertheless, low bone mineral densit y and 
osteoporosis at baseline are prevalent in the hemophilia population, and understanding this risk is important. Osteonecrosi s (most commonly  at the femoral head) is greatest with courses longer 
than proposed in this protocol but has occurred with short-term glucocorticoid exposure. Adrenal suppression is expected after two weeks of prednisolone therap y (Liu et al., 2013 ). The 
protocol’s empiric prednisolone taper minimizes this risk, and screening for this outcome will be performed following tapering of prednisolone to a physiologic dose ( Liu et al., 2013 ;
Ahmet et al., 2011 ). Subjects will be monitored for the development of Cushingoid features, as it 
is common within 2 months of start of therap y (Fardet et al., 2007) . Hypergly cemia may  occur 
and glucose will be assayed regularly  in all study  subjects. Glucocorticoids used for even short 
periods of time may  lead to psy chiatric and cognitive disturbances including memory
impairment, irritability , mood lability  and sleep disturbance. For osteonecrosis, adrenal suppression, hy

7. STUDY DESIGN
7.1Brief Summary
This is a global, Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label, safet y, and dose esc alation study  of BAX 888 
in adult subjects with severe hemophilia A. Up to 12 subjects may be administered BAX 888 in 
up to 3 dose cohorts. 
Before an y stud y-related procedures are followed, subjects will provide signed informed consent. 
During the course of the study , FVIII activity levels will be assessed by a central laboratory
(both the one- stage and chromogenic assay s) and by  the local laboratory  (either one-stage or 
chromogenic assay ) as specified in Table 3.  However, only central laboratory  FVIII activity
level s derived from the one- stage clotting assay  will be utilized for the primary  anal ysis. FVIII 
activity level s obtained from the central labo ratory chromogenic assay  will be utilized to support 
the one- stage assay  results. BAX 888 will be administered as a single peripheral IV infusion. On 
the day  of dosing with BAX 888 (Day 0), subjects will be admitted to the infusion center and 
will be observed for at least 8 hours following dosing. If the infusion center is not the subject’s 
Hemophilia Treatment Center/local investigator’s institution, a second separate consent will be obtained from the subject for the Day 0 visit and for all procedures surrounding the infusion period. Subjects will be monitored for the first 8 hours and may  remain in the infusion center for 
24 hours following the BAX 888 infusion at the discretion of the investigator or return to the center for the 24 -hour post-infusion follow-up. All subsequent follow-up visits will take place at 
the subject’s own Hemophilia Treatment Center/local investigator’s institution at: Week 1 and Week 2 (once weekl y), Weeks 3 to 14 (twice weekly, with separate clinic visit and laboratory 
visit each week), Week 15- 18 (once weekl y), and then Months 5, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36,

Safety , efficacy , and health- related quality  of life ( HRQoL ) data will be collected throughout the 
5-year post -gene transfer period.
7.2 Overall Study Design

Completion of study  enrollment with no further dosing
-Preliminary  evaluation following 2 subjects dosed with 2.0 × 1012cp/kg (lowest dose level) 
showed minimal impact on FVIII activity . Preliminary  evaluation following 2 subjects dosed 
6.0 × 1012cp/kg (middle dose level; 3 -fold higher than lowest dose level) suggests that the 
peak FVIII activity was as expected but increased more than proportional to the increase in dose. A mouse model suggested a potential non-linear dose- FVIII activity relationship 
(doubling of the dose might produce more than a doubling of the FVIII activity). To ensure informed dose escalation in subjects with hemophilia A, instead of a 3-fold increase in dose, the next proposed dose is 1.2 × 10
13cp/kg which is 2-fold the middle dose level originally
proposed.For If sustained Week 14 FVIII

Study  could be completed with no further dosing.
Immunosuppression
Vector -derived factor expression followed by  a decrease in factor levels has been observed in 
previous hemophilia gene therap y trials and has been attributed to an immune response directed 
against the successfully  transduced cells. To address this issue and to ensure factor activity is 
achieved and sustained, BAX 888 has been engineered to have a reduced prospect of eliciting an 
immune response.
Nevertheless, a proph ylactic course of glucocorticosteroid treatment with prednisolone as shown 
inTable 1 will be employ ed starting at Day 8 post-BAX 888 infusion. The following dosing 
schedule will be followed as a guideline. The corticosteroid regimen may be adjusted at the 
discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor depending on the subje ct’s tolerance of the regimen and the observed hepatic transaminase response. Subjects 
receiving corticosteroids may require unscheduled additional visits to evaluate potential side effects of corticosteroid therapy and for corticosteroid dose adjustments. FVIII activity levels 
and liver function tests (LFTs) will be measured at these unscheduled visits by local laboratories.

In geographies where prednisolone cannot be sourced at the strengths required for the specified 
dosing regimen (eg , USA), prednisone will be provided. Prednisone is converted to the active 
metabolite prednisolone and is recommended by the AASLD and the EASL for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis.
The purpose of the prophy lactic treatment with the taperin g course of prednisolone is to prevent 
clinical or subclinical hepatic inflammation and to support the potential for sustained transgenic 
factor VIII expression. 
Assessment of possible reactions to corticosteroids will be performed b y the Investigator and
modification of treatment instituted as necessary after consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor. I n such instances, consideration should be given to combination therap y with 
azathioprine/corticosteroid per AASLD guidelines or other drug as per standard of practice, in consultation with a hepatologist, so that the care can be individualized to the subject’s needs.
Recurrent elevations in transaminases after Year 1 should be evaluated and treated at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Full details on the procedures to be performed at each study visit, including screening, can be 
found in Section 19.1 (Study  Flow Chart and Dose Escalation), Section 19.2 (Schedule of Stud y 
Procedures and Assessments), and Section 19.3 (Clinical Laboratory  Assessments).
The following sections summarize the procedures and assessments to be performed at each visit.
7.2.1 Screen 1
Prior to Screen 1 visit, all subjects will undergo a minimum wash-out period of 5 days following 
their last FVIII therap y (on -demand or proph ylaxis), after which blood samples will be collected 
to determine eligibility at Screen 1 visit. Baseline FVIII activity  levels will be based on the 
central laboratory  one- stage clotting assay  and determined at the Screen 1 visit.
The following procedures and assessments will be performed:
Signed informed consent for Screen 1 visit.
Eligibility  criteria checked.

7.2.11 Further Management of Presumptive Vector -Related Hepatitis
Any subject who develops an ALT or AST level >3 × upper limit of normal ( ULN) during the 
study  will continue to be treated with prednisoloneixas outlined in the Prednisolone Tapering 
Regimen tables above in the I mmunosuppression Section (Section 7.2). Additionally , the subject 
must have the test repeated and confirmed within 72 hours.
In addition, if an increase in transaminase ALT or AST of 3 × ULN is observed, the additional 
clinical and laboratory  monitoring should be initiated by the investigator. To ensure subject 
safet y and comply with regulatory guidance, the investigator is to consult with the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor regarding collection of specific recommended clinical information and follow- up laboratory  tests. If the level remains >3 × ULN, a diagnostic workup of potential 
infectious and toxic/metabolic causes of hepatitis will be pursued, including consultation with a hepatologist. This workup of potential etiologies for hepatitis (that may be unrelated to the Investigational product) will include careful history to assess potential liver diseases resulting from toxic exposures including alcoholic liver disease and laboratory  evaluation by Central lab 
for potential viral co-infection with HBV, HCV, hepatitis E virus, hepatitis A virus as well as for non-infectious etiologies for hepatitis including hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, and alpha- 1 antitry psin deficienc y.
The laboratory workup to be obtained includes the following studies , which may  be 
supplemented by additional studies as determined to be appropriate for the individual case by the consulting hepatologist:
Potential viral co- infection: anti- HCV antibody, HCV RNA PCR, Hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg), anti-H epatitis B core (HBc) immunoglobulin M ( IgM) Ab, anti-Hepatitis A virus 
(HAV) IgM, anti -Hepatitis E virus ( HEV) IgM.
Hemochromatosis: serum ferritin (elevated iron stores), transferrin saturation.
Autoimmune hepatitis: total serum immunoglobulin G ( IgG), antinuclear antibody  (ANA), 
SMA (smooth muscle antibody ), anti -liver/kidney microsomes t ype 1 ( LKM1 ) antibodies, 
anti- liver cytosol ty pe 1 ( LC 1 ), AMA (anti- mitochondrial antibody ).
Alpha1- antitry psin deficiency : serum alpha antitrypsin.
Wilson’s disease: serum and urine copper, serum ceruloplasmin.
                                                
ixIn geographies where prednisolone cannot be sourced at the strengths required for the specified dosing regimen 
(eg, USA), prednisone will be provided. Prednisone is converted to the active metabolite prednisolone, and is recommended by the AASLD and the EASL for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis.For HCV antibody

201501 Protocol Am endment 9 10Nov 2021
Severe autoimmune hepatitis is defined by  the American Association for the Study  of Liver 
Diseases (AASLD) as an AL T or AST of ≥10 × ULN OR ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN with serum 
total IgG ≥2 × ULN or bridging necrosis on biopsy. Severe disease requires urgent treatment 
with corticosteroids. The AASL D evidence -based guidelines state that autoimmune hepatitis 
patients who have no, or only  mild sy mptoms or laboratory abnormalities have very  good 
immediate survival without corticosteroid therap y.
Management of presumptive vector-related hepatitis will be in accordance with a modified (more 
conservative) version of the most recent published guideli nes by the AASLD: “Diagnosis and 
Management of Autoimmune Hepatitis” and the EASL for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis
x,(European Association for the Study  of the L iver, 2015 ).
If no other cause of the elevated ALT is identified, consideration should be given to combination therap y with azathioprine/corticosteroid per AASLD guidelines or other drug regimens as per 
standard of practice, in consultation with a hepatologist. 
7.3Duration of Study Period(s) and Subject Participation
The overall duration of the study  is 8 years from study  initiation ( ie, first subject enrolled) to 
study  completion ( ie, last subject last visit). The recruitment period is expected to be about 
40months.
The subject participation period is approximately  5.5 y ears including the screening period and 
the 5- year post gene transfer follow-up.
7.4 Outcome Measures
7.4.1 Primary Outcome Measure
The primary  outcome measure is the incidence of BAX 888-related AEs (serious or non-serious)

7.7 Investigational Product(s)
7.7.1 Packaging, Labeling, and Storage
Product Name: BAX 888
Vector Name (Biologic Substance) 
Serotype: AAV8
Gene Insert: F8Transgene
BAX 888 contains an AAV genome consisting of a modified (truncated) 320 bp transthy retin 
(pre-albumin, TTR) promoter/enhancer, followed by a 77 bp intron fragment from minute virus 
of mice-MVM, driving expression of a codon-optimized BDD F8cDNA. The codon 
optimization algorithm results in conservation of the wild type FVIII amino acid sequence 
without any  mutation introduced. The B domain of the FVIII is deleted with the SQ linker at the 
site of the deletion; this SQ linker is the same sequence that is used in the commercially available recombinant FVIII proteins Refacto
®and Xy ntha®. The gene insert has a s ynthetic short 
polyadeny lation se quence (polyA). The insert is bounded by  the 145 bp AAV2 inverted terminal 
repeats (ITR).
Both terminal repeats have the wild type 145 nucleotide sequence, so as to direct replication and 
packaging of conventional single strand AAV DNA sequences. The biolo gical function of the 
gene expression cassette has been tested by transfection, viral vector packaging, and in vivo
intravenous injection into hemophilia A mice.For BAX 888 contains an AAV genome consisting of a modified (truncated) 320 bp transthy

8.3 Withdrawal and Discontinuation
Any subject may voluntarily  withdraw (ie , reduce the degree of participation i n the study ) 
consent for continued participation and data collection. The reason for withdrawal will be 
recorded on the End of Study eCRF. Assessments to be performed at the termination visit (including in cases of withdrawal or discontinuation) are descri bed in Section 9.6and 
Section 19.1.
Discontinuation ( ie, complete withdrawal from study  participation) may  be due to dropout (ie , 
active discontinuation by subject) or loss to follow-up ( ie, discontinuation by  subject without 
notice or action). Additionally, the investigator and sponsor have the discretion to discontinue any subject from the study  if, in their judgment, continued participation would pose an 
unacceptable risk for the subject.
Subjects also will be withdrawn during the screening period for the following reasons:
The subject develops a confirmed FVIII inhibitory  antibody  (≥0.6 BU by  Nijmegen 
modification of the Bethesda assay ).
The subject is non- compliant with study  procedures, in the opinion of the investigator.

9. STUDY PROCEDURES
9.1 Informed Consent
Any subject who provides informed consent ( ie, signs and dates the informed consent form [ICF] 
and assent form, if applicable) is considered a subject in the study.
9.2 Subject Identification Code
The following series of numbers will comprise the SIC: protocol identifier ( eg, 201501) to be 
provided b y the sponsor, 2- or 3-digit number study site number ( eg, 02) to be provided by  the 
sponsor, and 3- or 4-digit subject number ( eg, 0003) reflecting the order of providing informed 
consent. For example, the third subject who signed an I CF at study  site 02 will be identified as 
Subject 201501- 020003. All study  documents ( eg, eCRFs, clinical documentation, sample 
containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Additionally , a 
uniquely  coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information 
that allows identification of a subject ( eg, collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would 
not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy.
9.3 Screening and Study Visits
In general, subjects will undergo at least 2 screening visits (1 and 2) prior to dosing with 
BAX 888 (refer also to Section 7.2. Initially , subjects will provide consent for procedures and 
assessments to be performed at the first screening visit. The rationale for the Screen 1 visit is that 
it is expected that approximately 30 to 35% of the adult hemophilia population will have circulating antibodies that recognize and may neutralize AAV8. Treatment with BAX 888 is expected to be sub-therapeutic or non-therapeutic in the presence of such evidence of adaptive immunity . Therefore, subjects may elect to perform Screen 1 initially  and to only  complete the 
full Screen 2 if eligible based upon the res ults of Screen 1. Subjects who meet all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will then advance to Screen 2, which will take place approximately 3 weeks but ≤70 day s prior to dosing with BAX 888. Subjects will provide consent for all procedures and 
assessments to be performed at the Screen 2 and all following Study  Visits. A targeted phy sical 
exam will be conducted at the Screen 2 visit. The rationale for the Screen 2 visit is to ensure that the subject does not have covert liver inflammation that has developed since the time of Screen 1 and does not have unrecognized immune responses to AAV or FVIII that have developed since the time of Screen 1, because the new development of either of these findings might compromise the safet y and efficacy of BAX 888 therap y. E-diaries to capture subject reported data including 
bleeding episodes and FVIII usage will also be distributed at the Screen 2 visit.
The study  site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all 
subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. For circulating antibodies that recognize and may

Ifasubject does not satisfy  all screening criteria, the same subject may be re -screened at a later 
date. A complete or partial re- screen may  also become necessary  at the discretion of the 
investigator or sponsor. All screening data will be collected and reported in eCRFs, regardless of 
screening outcome. For the purpose of anal ysis, only  the data from the most recent screening 
outcome will be used. If a subject is re- screened, the End of Study  eCRF should be completed, 
and a new ICF, new SI C and new eCRF are required for that subject. Exemptions may  be 
granted for administrative reasons ( eg, delay  in timely availability  of laboratory  results). 
9.4 Medications and Non-Drug Therapies 
The following medications and non-drug therapies are notpermitted within 4 weeks prior to 
dosing and during the course of the stud y (unless stated otherwise):
Medications:
Systemic antiviral and/or interferon therapy (with the exception of antiretroviral 
therap y).
Concurrent chemotherapy or biological therapy for treatment of neoplastic disease or 
other disorders.
Received an AAV vector previously  or any other gene transfer agent in the previous 
12 months prior to Study  Day  0.
An investigational intervention within 4 weeks prior to dosing or within 5 half-lives of 
the investigational drug administration, whichever is longer.
Non-drug therapies:
Major surg ery or an orthopedic surgical procedure planned within 6 months after 
dosing.
A subject who has taken any of these medications or anticipates receiving any of these non- drug 
therapies within the specified timeframe will be recorded as a protocol deviation.
The following medications and non-drug therapies are permitted within 4 weeks before study

9.4.1 Use of Exogenous FVIII Throughout the Study
Clinical bleeding episodes will be managed with infusion of exogenous FVIII. Usage of 
exogenous FVIII for the prevention (proph ylactic treatment) or episodic management 
(on-demand FVIII treatment) of hemorrhages will be at the discretion of the investigator and/or 
local hemophilia physician, and in consultation with the study  subject. However, in order to 
assess FVIII activity levels derived specificall y from the BAX 888 transgene and not exogenous 
FVIII produc ts, subjects will be asked to refrain from prophy lactic FVIII usage between Weeks 3 
to 18 post- BAX 888 administration and during the 3 weeks prior to the Month 9 Visit. During 
these periods which are critical for the evaluation of sustained FVIII expression from the vector (as both an efficacy  and safet y evaluation), on -demand treatment that is required for clinical 
bleeding should, if possible, be performed using a standard half- life FVIII product (rather than an 
extended half- life FVIII concentrate). 
All use of exogenous FVIII will be recorded by the subject in the e- diary  (source document) and 
transcribed by the site to the eCRF.
It is recognized and expected that suspected or evident bleeding episodes will be treated with 
infused FVIII protein as per the standard of care. If possible, study  visits should be scheduled at 
least 3 to 5 day s after a FVIII dose to minimize the chance that any  FVIII activity level measured 
at the study  visit results from exogenously administered FVIII. However, with the exception of 
Screen 1, stud y visits should not be postponed if the study subject has infused FVIII ( eg, for the 
treatment of bleeding) within 4 day s of the scheduled study  visit. 
9.5 Subject Diary and Patient Reported Outcomes

measure generic HRQoL. This 36-item questionnaire measures 8 domains, including: 
physical functioning, role- physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, 
role emotional, and mental health. Two summary  scores can be calculated, the Phy sical 
Component Score and the Mental Component Score; additionally, scores can be calculated for each of the 8 domains. Higher scores indicate better health status.
2.EuroQol- 5D: The EQ -5D is a self -administered, standardized measure of health status that 
provides a generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal consisting of the following 5 dimensions: mobility , self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety /depression each with 5 levels.
3.Haemo -QoL -A:The Haemo -QoL-Ais a validated hemophilia A –specific instrument 
covering 6 areas (ph ysical functioning, role functioning, worry , cons equences of bleeding, 
positive affect, and treatment concerns) (Rentz et al., 2008).
4.VERITAS- Pro: VERITAS -Pro is a self/parent -reported questionnaire consisting of 
24 questions on 6 (4-item) subscales (Time, Dose, Plan, Remember, Skip, Communicate) 
to assess adherence to prophy lactic treatment. Lower scores reflect higher adherence 
(Duncan et al., 2010 ).
5.HaemoPREF: HaemoPREF is a 14-item questionnaire designed to measure ease of use 
and patients' preference for hemophilia treatment (Teal et al., 2014 ).
6.Patient Activity Level: Subjects will be asked to estimate their activity  levels. This will 
consist of a few questions asking subjects to rate their current level of activity.
After stud y closure, the investigator will receive the PRO records for their subjects, including 
audit trail records, in PDF format .The data will be transmitted to the eCRF by  a validated 
transfer.
9.6 Subject Completion/Discontinuation
A subject is considered to have completed the study when he/she ceases active participation in 
the study  because the subject has, or is presumed to have, completed all study procedures 
according with the protocol (with or without protocol deviations).
Reasons for completion/discontinuation will be reported on the Completion/Discontinuation 
eCRF, including: completed, screen failure, AE ( eg, death), discontinuation by subject ( eg, lost 
to follow-up [defined as 3 documented unsuccessful attempts to contact the subject], dropout), physician decision ( eg, progressive disease, non- compliance with IP/protocol violation[s], 
recovery ), study terminated by  sponsor, or other (reason to be specified by  the investigator, eg , 
technical problems). Regardless of the reason, all data available for the subject up to the time of completion/discontinuation should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.

FVIII activity level (Central Laboratory : one-stage clotting and chromogenic assays; Local 
Laboratory: one -stage clotting or chromogenic assay ).
FVIII antigen.
10.2 Number of Bleeding Episodes Post- BAX 888 Infusion 
The primary  measure of hemostatic efficacy  is the number of bleeding episodes post- BAX 888 
administration. The number of bleeding episodes will be assessed based upon each individual 
bleeding episode, spontaneous or traumatic, recorded in the subject’s e- diary , and/or recorded in 
the physi cian/nurse/study site notes. Documented bleeding episodes in the 12 months prior to 
study  enrollment will also be recorded in the eCRF.
A bleed is defined as subjective ( eg, pain consistent with a joint bleed [see Section 19.4.1]) or 
objective evidence of bleeding which may  or may  not require treatment with FVIII. Bleeding 
episodes occurring at the same anatomical location ( eg,right knee) with the same etiology
(eg,spontaneous vs. injury ) within 72 hours of onset of the first episode will be considered a 
single bleeding episode. If a bleed occurs following resolution of the bleed, it will be considered to be a “new” bleed and recorded accordingl y. Bl eeding occurring at multiple locations related to 
the same injury  (eg, knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding 
episode.
Adverse events and the details of concomitant medication use coincident with the treatment of all 
acute bleeding episodes will be recorded. Note that bleeding episodes are not to be reported as AEs (Section 11.1) .
Hemophilia-related events meeting the criteria for seriousness will be reported as SAEs and described on the SAER form.
10.3 Consumption of Exogenous FVIII Compared to before Gene Transfer
Data pertaining to the consumption of exogenous FVIII during the 12- month period prior to 
BAX 888 infusion will be collected and recorded as part of the medical history . Post -gene 
transfer consumption of exogenous FVIII will be measured at the time points in Table 2.For to be a “new” bleed and recorded accordingl

11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
11.1 Adverse Events
11.1.1 Definitions
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an IP that does 
not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be an y 
unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom ( eg, rash, pain, 
discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease ( eg, peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or outcome of death 
temporally  associated with the use of an I P, whether or not con sidered causally  related to the IP.
11.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose meets one 
or more of the following criteria:
1. Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death).
2.Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the 
investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death had it been more severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization - inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admission, regardless of 
length of stay .
4. Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (ie, a substantial disrupti on of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).
5. Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect.
6.Is a medically important event –a medical event that may not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or require hospitalization but may  jeopardize the subject 
or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed 
in the definitions above. Examples of such events are:
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dy scrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development 
of drug dependence or drug abuse.
Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for, HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV, or parvovirus B19 (B19V).
Development of a confirmed inhibitor to FVIII with an inhibitor level ≥0.6 BUusing 
the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.
Severe h ypersensitivity /anaphy lactic reactions to BAX 888.

Uncomplicated pregnancies, following paternal exposure to IP are not considered an (S)AE; 
however, an y pregnancy complication or pregnancy termination b y therapeutic, elective, or 
spontaneous abortion shall be considered an SAE. 
Any pregnancy  that occurs in the partner of the father after administration of IP but prior to 
clearance of BAX 888 genomes from the semen will be reported on a Pregnancy Report Form 
and followed-up at estimated date of delivery  and 1 y ear post- delivery , if feasible.
11.1.1.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)
Any suspected adverse reaction to study treatment ( ie, including active comparators) that is both 
serious and unexpected. 
The event(s) must meet all of the following
Suspected adverse reaction
Serious
Unexpected
Assessed as related to study  treatment
Once determined to meet the criteria for a SUSAR, a SAE should be submitted to regulatory
agencies expeditiously .
11.1.1.3 Non-Serious Adverse Event
A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE.
11.1.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Events
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity, specificity, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Saf ety 
Information (RSI). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB and/or 
prescribing information as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product, but are not specificall y ment ioned as occurring with 
the particular product under investigation. In addition, several human clinical trials using AAV2, AAV5 or AAV8 delivered via the systemic circulation have been associated with asymptomatic liver inflammation as evidenced b y elevate d liver transaminases (in particular, ALT elevations 
above the subject’s baseline) observed by laboratory evaluation. Liver enzyme elevation is a known complication for this drug class and is considered to be an expected complication of interest.For 11.1.1.4 Unexpected Adverse EventsFor 11.1.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Eventsnon-commercial Once determined to meet the criteria for a SUSAR, a SAE should be submitted to regulatory

The expec tedness of AEs will be determined by  the sponsor using the IB and/or prescribing 
information as the RSI . This determination will include considerations such as the number of 
AEs previously observed, but not on the basis of what might be anticipated from th e 
pharmacological properties of a product.
11.1.1.5 Preexisting Diseases
Preexisting diseases that are present before entry  into the study  are described in the medical 
history , and those that manifest with the same severity , frequency , or duration after IP exposure, 
will not be recorded as AEs. However, when there is an increase in the severity, duration, or 
frequency  of a preexisting disease, the event must be described on the AE eCRF.
11.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events
For the purposes of this study, the following non-serious events experienced after the first I P 
exposure are collected under other study endpoints and thus are not reportable on the AE eCRF, 
nor will they  be included in the anal ysis of AEs:
1.Hospital or study  site visits for administration of FVIII.
2. Hospitalization for routine bleeding episode management that could be managed in the 
clinic or home-setting but for which the subject was hospitalized.
3. Hospitalizations for planned medical or surgical procedures, eg, placement of a central 
venous line (however, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a 
preexisting disease, the event must be described on the AE eCRF).
4. Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study
period.
5. Bleeding episodes/hemophilia- related events: Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying 
disease and therefore are not AEs. If a bleeding episode was caused b y an injury ( eg, a 
fall), the injury  would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding 
other than a bleeding episode ( eg, abrasion of skin; fractured tibia). Therefore, any
hemophilia -related event (eg , hemarthrosis, bruising, hemorrhage) will not be reported as 
an AE, but these events will be recorded on the bleeding event eCRF. However, 
hemophilia -related events meeting the criteria for seriousness ( eg, a gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage requiring hospitalization) will be reported as SAEs and described on the SAER form.
All other AEs from the first I P exposure until study  completion/discontinuation will be described 
on the AE eCRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis could be established 
at the time of reporting the AE, a s ymptom or sign, in standard medical terminology in order to 
avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see definition in Section 11.1) . 
Each AE will be evaluated by the investigator for:

2.Severity  as defined in Section 11.1.2.1.
3. Causal relationship to I P exposure or study  procedure as defined in Section 11.1.2.2.
For each AE, the outcome ( ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with 
sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if applicable action taken ( ie, dose 
increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or 
unknown) will also be recorded on the AE eCRF. Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution, medically  stabilized, or 4 weeks after the study  completion/termination visit, 
whichever comes first, and the follow-up information is to be documented in the eCRF. If the severit y rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will 
be revised ( ie, the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of any  AE, the 
highest severity rating will be reported.
Deviations from the protocol-specified dosage (including overdosing, underdosing, abuse, and 
withdrawal), treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol-defined dosing schedule), failures of exp ected 
pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard to occurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy, and/or other observations because these events may be reportable to regulatory authorities.
If an investigat or becomes aware of an SAE occurring in a subject after study completion, the 
SAE must be reported on the provided SAER form within 24 hours after awareness; no additional reporting on eCRFs is necessary.
11.1.2.1 Severity
The investigator will assess the severit y of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment 
based on the most appropriate description below:
1.Mild
The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner with 
the subject’s normal functioning level.
The AE resolves spontaneously  or may  require minimal therapeutic intervention.
2.Moderate
The AE produces limited impairment of function and may require therapeutic 
intervention.
The AE produces no sequela/sequelae.
3.Severe
The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may  lead to temporary
inability  to resume usual life pattern.For The investigator will assess the severit For The investigator will assess the severitnon-commercial , and/or other observations because these events

intervention.
These severity  definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study- related 
proced ure(s), if necessary .
11.1.2.2 Causality
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the IP is 
etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment includes, eg, assessment of 
temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) 
with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likel y cause, and physiological 
plausibility . For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and 
the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
Related : The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent/procedure – ie, an event 
that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study  intervention, 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is confirmed by
improvement on stopping and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure and that could n ot 
be reasonabl y explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state. 
Possibly Related : An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response patt ern to 
thesuspected intervention, but that could readil y have been produced b y a number of other 
factors. 
Not Related : The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent/procedure - ie, 
another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinicall y plausible temporal sequence is 
inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is 
considered biologicall y implausible.
For events assessed as not related or unlikely related and occurring within 14 weeks after the I P 
administration, the investigator shall provide the alternative etiology . These causality  definitions 
will also be used to assess the relationship of an AE with a study-related procedure(s), if necessary .
11.2 Urgent Safety Measures

order to protect subjects participating in a clinical trial from immediate harm. For The adverse event is clearl For The adverse event is clearlnon-commercial improvement on stopping and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure and that could n

Urgent safety measures may  be taken by  the sponsor or clinical investigator, a nd may  include 
any of the following: 
1. Immediate change in study design or stud y procedures.
2.Temporary  or permanent halt of a given clinical trial or trials.
3.Any other immediate action taken in order to protect clinical trial participants from 
immediate hazard to their health and safet y.
The investigator may  take appropriate urgent safety measures in order to protect subjects against 
any immediate hazard to their health or safet y. The measures should be taken immediately  and 
may be taken without prior author ization from the sponsor. I n the event(s) of an apparent 
immediate hazard to the subject, the investigator will notify the sponsor immediately  by phone 
and confirm notification to the sponsor in writing as soon as possible, but within 1 calendar day
after the change is implemented. The sponsor will also ensure the responsible EC and relevant 
competent authorit y(s) are notified of the urgent safet y measures taken in such cases according to 
local regulations.
11.3 Untoward Medical Occurrences
Untoward medical occu rrences occurring before the first exposure to IP are not considered AEs 
(according to the definition of AE, see Section 11.1) . However, each serious untoward medical 
occurrence experienced before the first IP exposure ( ie, from the time of signed informed 
consent up to but not including the first IP exposure) will be described on the AE eCRF and on 
the SAE Report Form. These events will not be considered as SAEs and will not be included in the anal ysis of SAEs.
For the purposes of this study, each non- serious untoward medical occurrence experienced by  a 
subject unde rgoing study -related procedure(s) before the first IP exposure will be recorded on 
the AE eCRF; these events will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the anal ysis 
of AEs.
For the purposes of this study, each of the following non-serious events experienced after the 
first I P exposure will not be considered an AE, and thus, not included in the anal ysis of AEs:
Hospital or study  site visits for administration of BAX 888.
Hospitalization for routine bleeding episode management that could be man aged in the 
study  site or home-setting but for which the subject was hospitalized.
Hospitalizations for planned medical or surgical procedures, eg, placement of a central

Hospital admittance without inpatient hospitalization or emergency  room visit/admittance 
in itself (although the event triggering the visit may  be an SAE).
Seroconversion after documented HBV vaccination prior to or during the study  period.
Bleeding episodes/hemophilia-related events: 
Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs. 
Ifa bleeding episode was caused b y an injury ( eg, a fall), the injury  would not be reported 
as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode ( eg, abrasion 
of skin; fractured tibia). Therefore, any hemophilia-related event (eg, hemarthrosis, 
bruising, hemorrhage) will not be reported as an AE, but these events will be recorded 
on the bleeding episode eC RF. However, hemophilia -related events meeting the criteria 
for seriousness ( eg, a gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring hospitalization) will be 
reported as SAEs anddescribed on the SAER form.
11.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Subjects
Male subjects will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately  inform the 
investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the stud y or within 6 months after infusion 
date. A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by  the investigator immediat ely (ie, no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy ) and submitted via the electronic data capture 
(EDC )system. Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome 
of an y pregnancy in the partner of a male subject exposed to BAX 888. The pregnant partner will 
need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow 
for follow- up on her pregnancy . Once the authorization has been signed, the investigator will 
update the Pregnancy  ReporteCRF with additional information on the course and outcome of the 
pregnancy. An investigator who is contacted by the male subject or his pregnant partner mayprovide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, tosupport an informed decision in cooperation with the treating ph ysician and/or obstetrician. In 
the event that the EDC system is unavailable, follow reporting instructions provided for Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects and Abortions. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female partner of a male subject exposed to study drug should be classified as an SAE, recorded on the AE eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately ( ie, no more than 24 
hours after learning of the event). An y abortion performed in response to the identification of 
possible congenital anomaly /birth defect should be reported in the same fashion.
11.4 Non-Medical Complaints
A non- medical complaint (NMC) is any  alleged product deficiency  that relates to identity , 
quality , durabi lity, reliability , safet y and performance of the product but did not result in an

Any NMCs of the product will be documented on an NMC form and reported to the sponsor 
within 1 business day . If requested, defective product(s) will be returned to the sponsor for 
inspection and anal ysis according to procedures.
11.5 Medical, Medication, and Non-Drug Therapy History
At the Screen 1 visit, the subject’s medical history will be described for the following body
systems including severity  (defined in Section 11.1.2.1 ) or surgery  and start and end dates, if 
known: eyes, ears, nose, and throat; respiratory; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal; musculoskeletal; neurological; endocrine; hematopoietic/ly mphatic; dermatological; and 
genitourinary . History  will also include hemophilia history  (confirmation of diagnosis and 
severit y; presence of any  target joints; historical ABR based on documented data within the 
previous 12 months) and documentation of all FVIII replacement therapies and other medications used within the last 12 months.
The historical ABR including treated and untreated bleeding episodes in the 12 months prior to

An infectious center assay  is used as a quality  control and part of the characterization of the 
stocks of the investigational product. No viral growth- based assay  is used in the evaluation of the 
body  fluids of the treated subject.
11.7.7 Assessment of Laboratory Values
The investigator’s assessment of each laboratory value will be recorded on the eCRF. For each 
abnormal laboratory  value, the investigator will determine whether the value is considered 
clinically  significant or not. For clinicall y significant values, the inves tigator will indicate if the 
value constitutes an new AE (see definition in Section 11.1, and record the sign, s ymptom, or 
medical diagnosis on the AE eCRF), is a s ymptom or related to a previously recorded AE, is due 
to a pre -existing disease (described in Section 11.1.1.5 ), or is due to another issue that will be 
specified. If the abnormal value was not clinically significant, the investigator will indicate the reason, ie, because it is due to a preexisting disease, due to a laboratory error, or due to another 
issue that will be specified. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically  indicated. Any  abnormal value that persists should be followed at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
11.8 Vital Signs and 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
Vital signs will include body temperature (°C or °F), respiratory  rate (breaths/min), pulse rate 
(beats/min), and s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg).
Vital signs will be measured at Screen 2, on Day  0 up to 3 hours before administration of I P and 
5, 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after administration of I P, at each subsequent study
visit, and at study  completion/discontinuation. Blood pressure will be measured when subj ects 
are in the supine position.
Vital sign and 12 -lead ECG values are to be recorded on the eCRF. For each value, the 
investigator will determine whether the value is considered an AE (see definition in 
Section 11.1) and record the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE eCRF. Additional 
tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal result, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated.

12. STATISTICS
All details regarding the statistical analy sis and the preparation of tables, listings, and figures will 
be described in the statistical anal ysis plan (SAP).
12.1 Sample Size and Power CalculationsThe sample size is expected to range from 2 to 12 evaluable subjects depending on the actual 
number of cohorts and the actual number of subjects in each cohort. This sample size was chosen to provide sufficient evidence of safet y and exploration of signs of efficacy for this indication 
and is not based on formal statistical considerations. The sample size and escalation plan are designed to minimize the risk to subjects of experiencing significant toxicity or receiving a sub-therapeutic dose. If a given dose shows lack of efficacy , enrollment will be limited to 
2 subjects in the cohort.
With the limited number of subjects per group, statistical analyses will be primarily conducted in 
a descriptive fashion. There are no inferential procedures planned.
12.2 Analysis Sets
Classification into the Safety  Anal ysis Set will be conducted prior to database lock. The Safety
Analy sis Set will consist of all subjects that have received 1 administration of the I P. All safet y 
analyses (including the primary  anal ysis) will be performed on the Safet y Analysis Set.
12.3 Handling of Missing, Unused, and Spurious DataSince the statistical analyses will be presented in descriptive summary tables and individual data 
listings, no action will be taken to handle missing data. All data will be evaluated as observed; no 
imputation method for missing values will be used. A subject who withdraws prior to the last planned observation in a trial period will be included in the analys es up to the time of 
withdrawal.
12.4 Methods of Analysis
In general, descriptive summaries will be presented for the primary , secondary , and tertiary
outcome measures. Continuous variables will be summarized using mean, standard deviation 
(SD), maximum, minimum, median, and other percentiles as appropriate. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Analyses will be performed within each cohort separatel y and overall. The primary outcome of the incidence of BAX 888-related 
AEs will be anal yzed as a categorical variable. More detailed information about summarization 
of data, graphical representations, and anal ysis conventions will be provided in the SAP.For yses will be presented in descriptive summary tables and individual data

19.4 Definitions
19.4.1 Joint Bleeds
Features of an acute joint bleed include some or all of the following: ‘aura’, pain, swelling, 
warmth of the skin over the joint, decreased range of motion and difficulty  in using the limb 
compared with baseline or loss of function.
The earliest clinical signs of a joint bleed are increased warmth over the area and discomfort with 
movement, particularl y at the ends of range.
Later s ymptoms and signs include pain at rest, swelling, tenderness, and extreme loss of motion.
In patients with advanced arthropathy  it may  be difficult to distinguish pain-related arthritis from 
that associated with an acute bleed. Rapid resolution of pain following infusion of factor concentrates (t ypical of an acute hemarthrosis) or improvement of p ain associated with activity
soon after a period of rest (typical of chronic arthritis) can help distinguish between the two.
In infants and young children, reluctance to use the limb alone may  be indicative of a 
joint/muscle bleed.
19.4.2 Muscle Bleeds
Muscle bl eeds can occur in any  muscle of the body , usuall y from a direct blow or a sudden 
stretch. A muscle bleed is defined as an episode of bleeding into a muscle, determined clinicall y 
and/or by  imaging studies, generally associated with pain and/or swelling and functional 
impairment over baseline.
For further definitions of CNS, gastrointestinal, and abdominal hemorrhages see the Guidelines 
for the Management of Hemophilia from the World Federation of Hemophilia (World Federation of Hemophilia Treatment Guidelines Working Group, 2012 ).

Study Synopsis  
 
 
Title A  Phase  II  Investigator  Sponsored  Study  of  Nivolumab  in 
Patients with Advanced Refractory Biliary Tract Cancers 
Clinical study phase Phase II 
Study objective(s) Primary Objective 
 
The primary endpoint will be overall response rate (ORR). ORR 
is defined as complete responses (CR) plus partial responses 
(PR). 
 
Secondary Objectives 
• To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events 
and tolerability of the regimen in patients with advanced 
refractory BC receiving nivolumab 
• To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) in 
patients with advanced refractory BC receiving 
nivolumab. PFS is defined as the duration of time from 
start of treatment to time of progression or death, 
whichever comes first. 
• To determine the overall survival in patients with 
advanced refractory BC receiving nivolumab 
• To determine the overall response rate by the immune 
response criteria 
 
 
Exploratory Objectives 
 
Immunohistochemical staining and next generation sequencing 
will be performed with tumor samples to evaluate the correlation 
with clinical outcome in a descriptive analysis. .

Background  
The outcome of patients with advanced biliary cancer remains 
dismal with the current standard of care options. There is 
currently an unmet medical need for patients with advanced BC 
who have failed systemic therapy. 
 
BC includes a heterogeneous group of cancers but data has 
suggested that there is an immune  component to the development 
of these tumors and high PD-1 protein expression has been found. 
The second line setting therefore offers a unique opportunity to 
evaluate the activity of anti-PD1 immunotherapy agents like 
nivolumab. 
 
Indication  
Patients with advanced biliary tumor who have failed at least one 
prior line of systemic therapy. 
 
Diagnosis and main criteria 
for inclusion  
Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented 
carcinoma primary to the intra- or extra-hepatic biliary system or 
gall bladder with clinical and/or radiologic evidence of 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients with 
ampullary carcinoma are not eligible. 
 
Patients must have failed one but no mo re than 3 prior lines of 
systemic chemotherapy for advanced biliary cancer. Patients who 
are intolerant to first line therapy will be allowed. Patients who 
had disease recurrence after first line therapy will be allowed. 
Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and had evidence 
of disease recurrence within 6 months of  completion of the 
adjuvant treatment are also eligible. If patient received adjuvant 
treatment and had disease recurrence after 6 months, patients will 
only be eligible after failing one line of systemic chemotherapy 
used to treat the disease recurrence. 
 
Patients must have measurable disease, as defined by RECIST 1.1 
criteria. 
 
Patients must not  have been treated with any prior anti-PD1, anti- 
PDL1, or anti-CTLA4 agents 
 
Study design  
This is a multi-institutional phase II single arm two-stage design 
trial using nivolumab as a single agent. 
4   
 
Type of control  
Patients will receive nivolumab at a dose of 240 mg IV every 2 
weeks for 16 weeks and then 480 mg  IV every 4 weeks until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 2 cycles (1 
cycle= 28 days), tumor response will be evaluated using the new 
international criteria proposed by the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines 
(version 1.1) as well as immune response criteria. Treatment 
beyond progressive disease (PD) will be allowed for pseudo 
progression as determined by clinical benefit or immune response 
criteria. 
 
Number of subjects  
52 evaluable 
 
Plan for statistica l analysis The primary endpoin t for this study will be re sponse rate (CR + 
PR) at 4 months. We w ill use a Simon’s Two-Stage Design in 
which the po wer is 0.9 and the type 2 error is 10%. The stud y 
will be expanded to the s econd stage if  there is a 20% 
probability of response. At l east 1 patient of the first 18 
enrolled will need to have a comple te or partial response for 
study continuation. 
Alternatively, if there are at lea st 4 patients with stable disease 
for 16 weeks (2 restaging assessments), the pr incipal 
investigator will discuss pro ceeding to the second stage of the 
study with the B MS medical team. 
 
T
he second stage of this study w ill involve an additional 14 
patients. The study w ill have met its primary endpoint of 
response rate if there are at least four patients in th e 
nivolumab  only arm who achieve a re sponse. 
 
We anticipate an attrition rate of 10%, so abo ut 40 patients 
will  be recruited. Based  on previous trials, we exp ect to 
enroll about 12 pa tients per year at our center and so wi ll 
involve 2 other center s to comple te enrollment within 18 
months. Pl ease see section 8.2 for rationale for the expansion 
of the study.

8  1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Background 
 
Biliary trac t cancers (BTC) typically include intra and e xtrah epatic cholangiocarcino ma and cancers 
of the gallbladder.  In the US in 2015, an es timated 2,600 intrahepa tic cholangiocarcinomas and 
10,000 cases of ext rahepatic bile duct cancer. Of the latter, two thirds were ga llbladder cancer s.1 
This is a rare but agg ressive group of malignancies with many pa tients presenting with advanced 
disease and overall dismal outcomes.2 
 
The only cure for patients who present with local disease is surgica l resection or live r 
trans
plantation. However, the ra te of disease recurrence remains high even in resectable patients  
and there is no compe lling data regarding the role for adjuvant therapy in this se tting. Though meta- 
analyses have shown a non significant over all survival benef it to adjuvant therapy,3 there is limited 
prospective data on which agents are active in this dis eas e. 
 
However, the ma jority of patients presen t with unres ectable dis ease and treatment options are very 
limited. Sy stemic chemotherapy has histori cally been disapp ointing in adv anced BTC, though new 
com
bination re gimens have shown activity. ABC-02, a randomized pha se III study, enro lled 410 
patients and compared gemcitabine plus cisplat in with gemc itabine alone.4 The median over all 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were greater for gemc itabine plus cisplatin th an 
for gemcitabine alone without si gnificantly inc reased toxicity (OS: 11.7 v 8.1 months; log- rank P 
= .002; PFS: 8.0 v 5.0 months; P = .003). This drug combin ation set a new interna tional standard of 
care for the first line treatment of advanced BTC. Based on ph ase II data, the combin ation of 
gemcitabine and oxaliplatin is al so used in the first line se tting after efficacy and tolerability were 
shown.5 
 
Several phase II trials have evalu ated various chemotherapy regimens in the second line se tting, 
including FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, 5 -fluorouracil, and leucovo rin), oxalipla tin with capecitabine, and 
5-fluorouracil and cisplatin.6,7 However, there is no established re gimen for treatment in patients 
with progression on first line th erapy or refractory disease. The survival in this se tt ing remains 
dismal at a median of less than 6 months.8-10 Advances have been slow in p art because  of the tumor 
heterogeneity of BTCs.11 There remains a significant need to identify nove l agents and to t reat this 
deadly disease. 
 
Out
comes can perhaps be improved with greater under standing of the underlying dis ease biology. 
The development of BT C appears to be re lated to the immune sy stem, and carcino genesis has been 
linked to chro nic parasitic infections a s well as autoimmune conditions like p rimary sclerosing 
cholangitis.12,13 In addition, patients with ev idence of immune sy stem activation, mea sured by 
higher levels of lymphocytes, have been shown to have i mproved prognosis.14 Recent data suggests 
that the immune regulatory protein PD-1 is up regulated in int rahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tis sues 
compared to cancer adjacent tumor s.15 It has also been shown that hi lar cholangiocarcinomas ma y 
evade immunolog ic surveillance through the apoptosis of lymphocytes.16 
 
In pre-clinical work at Moffitt Cancer Center, we found tha t cholangiocarcinoma tu mors which 
stained positive for CD45R0 (lymph node like structure) were associated with improved median OS 
(63 months vs 18 mon ths, P = 0.003).17 These immune active tu mors are likely to have es caped the 
inhibitory effects of  programmed dea th ligand complex. 
 
Immunoth erapy has been evaluated in a fe w patients with BTCs. In one ca se report, a patient with a 
locally advanced int rahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was treated initially with surgica l resection 
followed by adjuvant t reatment with immunotherapy (CD3 act ivated T cells as well as dendrit ic 
  
cells). She had no dis ease recurrence for over 3 ye ars.18 More recently, an anti-PD1 agen t was 
recently eva luated in tumor s with microsatellite instability in a pha se II study.19 Included in this 
cohort was one patient with mismatch repair deficient bile duc t cancer who had a partia l response 
with a 41% decrease in tumor size and a 93% decrea se in tumor marker at 20 week s. 
 
 
 
1.2 Nivolumab 
 
Human tumors have a myriad of genetic alterations lead ing to neoantigens which should be 
recognized by the host immune sy stem. However, cancer can dys regulate immune checkpoint 
proteins as a way of evading the host immune system and ensuring survival.20 Immunotherapy in 
oncology has b een evaluated as a m eans of up regulating the host immune sy stem so that tumor s can 
be recognized as foreign and endo genous an ti-tumor immunity can attack tumor cells. Immune 
checkpoint pa thway inhib itors such as anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies have been evaluated in 
the treatment of a variety of tumor s. 
 
Preclinical Stu dies 
 
Programmed death 1 is a protein which limits T-ce ll ac tivity in an effort to minimiz e 
aut
oimmunity.21 When activated by ligands, PD-1 along with its cos timulatory prote in B7, decrease 
T
 cell activity which can allow tumors to es cape immune recognition. Anti bodies against PD-1 have 
been developed in an effort to increa se T cell activity. 
 
N
ivolumab is a human monoclona l antibody tha t targets the programmed death-1 (PD-1) CD279 
cell surface membra ne receptor and inhibits PD-1 interaction with its ligand s PD -L1 and PD-L2. 
PD-1 knockout mice develop autoimmune conditi ons from excessive T ce ll activity including 
glomerulonephritis and autoimmune car di omyopathy.22,23 In vitro, nivolumab h as resulted in 
increased T- cell proliferation and interferon ga mma release in mixed lymphocyte reaction.24 In 
vivo, PD-1 blockade by a nivolumab analog resulted in enhanced anti-tumor re sp onse and tumor 
rejection in sever al murine mo d els (BMS investigator’s brochure). Nivolumab has been generall y 
well 
tolerated in the preclinical setting. In toxicity studies of cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was 
tolerated at doses of 50mg/kg every 2 weeks. Ther e was increased neonatal morta lity in pregnant 
monkeys, in k eeping with the ro le of PD-L1 in maintaining murine fetomaternal tolerance.25 
 
 
 
Clinical Studies 
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
Nivolumab h as been tested in over 8600 human subjects with doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg as 
both a single dose as well as multip le doses every few weeks. Steady state drug concentration was 
achieved by 12 weeks when nivolumab wa s administered at 3mg/kg every 2 weeks. Dr ug clearan ce 
has not been affected by age, gender , race, or tu mor type. Though  glomerular filtration rate and mild 
hepatic impairment have had an effect on cl earance, it has not been clinica lly meaningful. 
 
Clinical Efficacy 
Nivolumab has been FDA approv ed for the trea tment of metastat ic melanoma, metasta tic non-small 
cell lung cancer, and clear cell renal cancer based on the re su lts of phase III studies.26-29 The 
majority of responses ha ve been durable and have ex ceeded 6 months. In melanoma, nivolumab has 
been approved in metasta tic dise ase in the first line sett ing. In non-squa mous lung cancer, it has 
been approved in advance d disease after progression on one prior t reatme nt. Similarly, nivolumab is 
appr
oved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma p atients who have progressed on pre vious 
therapy. 
 
9 
10  Clinical S afety 
No maximum tol erated dose of nivolumab has been established a t doses tested up to 10mg/kg. The 
safety profi le is similar across tumor type s and there has been no patt ern of adverse effects with 
regards to incidence or severity based on dose level. Common drug related adver se effects have 
included pulmonary toxic ity, GI toxicity, liver toxic ity, and dermatologic toxicity, the majority of 
which have been manageable wi th supportive care, dose delay, or st eroid treatments. 
 
The  overall  safety  experience  with  nivoluma b  is  based  on  c li n  ic a l  experience  in 
approximately 8,600 subj ects. In genera l, for mon otherapy, the safety profi le is similar acro ss 
tumor types. The   most   frequently  reported treatment-related AE is fatigue, which is almos t 
always of low grade. 
 
Rationale: 
 
The outcome of patients with advanced biliary cancer  remains d isma l with the current standard of 
care options. Ther e is no established second line option for pa tients with advanced BC who have 
failed one prior sy stemic therapy. 
 
 
Given that immune modulatory agents are known to have activity in BTCs,30 we propose to 
evaluate the anti-PD1 agent nivolumab in advanced, refrac tory BTC, a rare malignancy in which 
there is a critica l unmet clinical need. 
 
2. Study Objectives 
Primary Obj ective 
To determine the disease response rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) in patients wi th 
advanced biliary tract cancers (BTC) receiving nivolumab as a single agent 
 
Secondary Objectives 
1. To determine the median prog ression free survival (PFS) and overall surviva l (OS) and response 
rate by immune response criteria in patients with advanced BTC receiving n ivolumab 
 
2. To determine the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in B TC 
 
Exploratory Objectives 
 
1. To explore potential co rrelations between mismatch repair status and  outcome 
 
 
2. T
o explore potential correlation of mutation al burden and outcome, a s evaluated by the Ke w 
CancerPlex immune signature panel. 
 
3. Study Design  
 
 
This is a multi-ins titutional single arm study with two stage de sign using ni volumab in advanced 
BTC, who h ave failed or are intolerant to at least one line of th erapy and no more than 3 lines of 
therapy. In the first stage, 18 p atients will be accr ued. If there is at least one response (or several 
patients wi th stable disease based on the study t eam’s discretion), an additional 14 patients will be 
accrued for a total of 32 patients. Patien ts will receive nivolumab at a fla t dose of 240mg every 2 
weeks for 16 weeks (4 cycles). Respo nse and progression will be evaluated using the new 
11  international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criter ia in Solid Tu mors 
(RECIST) guidel ines (version 1.1).  The pr imary endpoint is d isease response after 2 cycles of 
treatment (8 weeks). Patients with stable disease or disease response wil l continue on therapy until 
progression. Patients can continue on therapy if there is pseudo -progression which is defined by the 
immune response criteria or if they are having c linical benefi t as determined by the investigator 
after discussion with the princip al investiga tor.

• History or concurrent condition of  interstitial lung dis ease of any grade or severely impaired 
pulmonary function. 
• Unresolved toxicity higher than CTCAE g rade 1 attributed to any p rior therapy/procedure 
excluding alopeci a. 
• Pregnant or breast-feeding pa tients. Women  of childbe aring potential must have a negativ e 
serum o r urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitiv ity of 25 IU/L or equiv alent units of HCG) 
perfor med within 24 hours prior to the start o f nivolumab and a negative re sult must be 
documented  before start of treatmen t. 
• Any illness or medica l conditions tha t are unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the 
patient and his/her complian ce in the stu dy. 
 
Excluded Th erapies and Medication s for Cancer  
 
• Anticancer chemotherapy during the study or within 4 weeks of study enrollmen t. Subjects 
must have recov ered from the tox ic effects of the p revious anti-cancer chemotherapy (with 
the exception of alopecia).  Anti- can cer therapy is defined as any agent or combination of 
agents with clinically p roven anti-tumor activity administered by any route with the 
purpose of affecting the malignancy,  either directly or indirectly, including pal liative and 
therapeutic endpoints. 
• Hormonal therapy during the study or with in 2 weeks of first study enro llment. 
• Radiotherapy to t arget lesions during study or within 2 weeks of enrol lme n t. 
• An irradiated lesion is cons idered evaluable only if it ha s shown enl arg ement since the 
completion of las t radiation. 
• Bone marrow t ransplant or ste m cell r escue. 
• Investigation al drug therapy outside of this trial during or within 4 weeks of first s tudy 
treatment. 
 
 
 
4.3 Withdrawal of Su bjects from Study 
 
4.3.1 Withdrawal  
 
Subjects must discontinue investigational produc t for any of the following r easons: 
• Withdrawal of informed consent (sub ject’s decision to wi thdraw f or any reason). A 
subject must be remov ed from the tria l at his/her own requ est or at the request of his/he r 
legally acceptable representative. A t any time during the tria l and without g ivi ng 
reasons, a subject may decline to p articipate further. The subjec t will not suffer any 
disadvantage as a result. 
• Any clinica l adverse event (AE), labo ratory abnorma lity or intercurrent illness which, in 
the
 opinion of the investiga tor, in dicates that continued p articipation in the study is not 
in t
he best interest of the subject 
14  • Pregnancy will be reported as an SAE and the pa tient will be withd rawn. (Note : subjects 
who have been withdrawn from t reatment with study drug be cause of p regnancy should 
not undergo CT s cans [with contrast]/M RI or bone s cans while pregnant.) 
• Termination of the study by Bristol-My ers Squibb (BMS) 
• Loss of ability to freely provide consent through i mprisonment or involuntar y 
inc
arceration for t reatment of either a psychiatr ic or physical (e.g., infec tious disease) 
illness. 
• Subject is lost to fol low-up 
• Death 
 
All subjects who discontinue should comply with pro tocol specified follow-up and surv ival 
procedures. The ONLY ex ception to this requirement is when a subjec t withdraws consent for al l 
study procedures or loses the ability to consen t freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involunt arily 
incarcerated  for the treatment of e ither a psychiatr ic or physical illness). If a subject was withdrawn 
before completing the study, the reason for wi thdr awal must be ente red on the appropria te case 
report form page. 
 
 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the s tudy for the following reason s: 
 
• The subject is non -complian t with study d rug, trial procedures, or both; including the use 
of anti-cancer therapy not p rescribed by the study pro tocol. 
• Severe allergic reaction to nivolumab 
• The development of a second cancer. 
• Development of another il lness or si tuation which  would, in the judgment of the 
investigator, signifi cantly affec t assessments of clinical status and tria l endpoints. 
• Deterioration of ECOG perfo rmance status to 3 or 4.  
• Use of illicit drugs or other su bstances that may, in the opinion of the inves tigator, have a 
re
asonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise skewing trial result. 
 
Any subjec t removed from the trial w ill remain under medi cal supervision until d ischarge or 
transfer is medically acceptable. 
 
Any subjec t with progression of disease will come off of treatment. In all cases, the reason for 
withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the su bject's medica l records. 
 
 
 
4.3.2 Screen Failures/ Dropouts/Replacements 
 
A subject who discontinues study p articipation prematurely for any reasons except death, d isease 
progression and severe toxicity is d efined as a dropout. 
 
Dropouts who did no t receive at least one st aging assessment (after 2 cycles or 8 weeks of 
treatment) w ill need to be re placed. 
 
A subject who, consents to p articipate but does not qu alify for treatment based upon the eligibility 
criteria is regarded a “screening failure”. 
 
Patients who are screening failures will need to be replaced. 
 
Pa
tient who receive at l east one st aging ass essment (after 2 cycles or 8 weeks of t reat ment), will be 
included in the an alysis of disease response. 
15  5. Treatment 
 
5.1 Treatment to be administered  
 
All patients will receive Nivolumab 
 
 
Agent Dose Route  Schedule* 
 
Nivolumab 240mg IV q2weeks   until 16 weeks 
 
*One cycle = 28 days 
 
Agent Dose Route  Sch edule* 
 
Nivolumab 480mg IV q4weeks   from 17 weeks to end of study 
 
 
 
 
5.1.1 Flat Dose Regimen 
 
The safety and efficacy of 240  mg Q2W flat d ose of nivolumab is expected to be similar to 
3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen. Using the PPK model, exposure of nivolumab at 240 mg flat dose 
is identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subj ects weighing 80 kg, which is the approximate median 
body weight in nivolumab clinical trials.  Across the various tumor typ es in the clinical program, 
nivolumab has bee n shown to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of 10  mg/kg, and the 
relationship b etween nivolumab exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and effic acy and safety has been 
found to be relativ ely flat. Given the similarity of niv olumab PK across tumor types and  the 
similar expo sures predicted following administ ration of 240 mg flat dose compared to 3 mg/kg, 
it is expected that the safe ty and efficacy pro file of 240 mg nivolumab  will be similar to t hat of 
3 mg/kg nivo lumab. Hen ce, a flat dose of 240 mg ni volumab is under i nvestigation. Of note, 240 
mg is identical to 3mg/kg for 80 kg pa tients; 80 kg is the median body weight. 
 
 
 
5.2 Management of Toxicities Associated with St udy Drug 
 
Subjects will receive trea tment with nivolumab as a 60 minute IV infusion, on W eek 1, Day 1 and 
Week 3, D
ay 1 of a treatmen t cycle (every 2 weeks). 
 
There will be no do se escalations or reduct ions of ni volumab allowed. This incl udes both the 
240mg q 2 week portion of the study as well as the 480mg q 4 week portion of the study. 
 
Su
bjects may be dosed no le ss than 12 day s from the pre vious dose. There ar e no premedications 
recommended for nivolumab on the first cycle. If an acute infusion reaction is noted, subjects 
should be man aged according to S ection 5.2.5. 
 
Treatment may be delayed for up to a maximum of 6 weeks from the last do se (See Sections 5.2.1 
and 5.2.4.1). 
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study. Trea tment modifications (eg dose 
delay or discontinuation) will be based on  specific laboratory and adver se event criteria. 
 
In some cases, the na tural history of immunotherapy- related AEs of specia l intere st can di ffer and 
be more severe than AEs caused by other th erapeutic classes. Early reco gnition and management 
may mitigate sever e toxicity . The management of organ specif ic toxicities is detailed through flow 
sheets in Appen dix 1. 
16  Summary of Sa fety 
 
Most related AEs are thought to be due to  the effects of inf la mmatory cells on specific tissues. In 
general, the appro ach to suspected nivolumab -related AEs is similar across any invo lved 
organ system. Safety management algo rithms for organ-specif ic AEs are found in Appendix 1. 
Subjects  should   have  a th orough  dia gnostic  work -up   to   ev aluate  potentia l  drug-  and 
non-drug-related diagnos es. For suspected nivolumab-related AEs, based on the severity of the 
event, management with  immunosuppressant may be necessary. In genera l, dose  delays and 
observation are adequate for low-grade AEs. For mode rate- and high-g rade AEs, 
immunosuppression wi th corticosteroids should be utilized. Once the AE has begun to i mpr ove, 
corticosteroids can be tapered over approx imately 3 weeks to 6 weeks (d epending on the severity 
of the AE). 
 
Immune Mediated Eve nt Assessme nt 
 
This assessment of AE is made by the individual i nves tigator and should be based on clinica l 
evidence su ch as: 
• Responsiveness to treatment (e.g. st eroids) 
• Diagnostic test results (e.g. evidence of inflamma tion) 
• Medical history (other illn ess, prior therapies, etc.) 
 
An IMAE is an AE consistent with an immune-mediated m echanism or immune- 
mediated  component (alternate etiology ex acerbated by the induction of autoimmun ity ) for 
which non-  inflamma tory etiologie s (e.g. infection or tumor prog ression) have been ruled out, 
and  consideration given to evid ence of inflamma tion such as tumor biop sies or respo nsiveness 
to  steroids. 
Likely reasons an event is not an IMAE: 
• Likely due to  concomitant drug/chemo therapy/radiation 
• Documented ev idence of tumor a s cause 
• Same grade event at baseline/history 
• Event likely caused by infection 
 
Likely reasons an event is an IMAE: 
• Inflammation per pathology or endoscopy 
• Improves/resolves after immunosupp ression 
• Similar to previous immune mediated event in sa me organ 
 
 
 
Pulmonary Adverse Events 
 
Pulmonary AEs have been observ ed following treatment with nivolumab and have occur red after a 
single dose and  after as many as 48  treatments. The majority of cases reported were Gr ade 1 or 
2, and subjects p resented wi th either asymptomatic radiographic changes (eg,  focal ground glas s 
opacities and  patchy infiltrates) or with symptoms of dyspnea, cough, or fever. Subjects with 
reported Grade 3 or 4 pulmonary AEs were noted  to have mo re severe symptoms, mo re extensive 
radiographic findings, and hypoxia. At this time, no underlying risk factor, including p rior 
radiotherapy, presence of lung metastase s, or underlying pulmonary medi cal history, has been 
iden
tified. 
 
Guidelines on the reco mmended management of pneumonitis  and other pulm onary AEs ar e 
found in Appendix 1. Early recognition and  treatment of pneumonitis  is c ritical to its management. 
Subjects should be advised  to seek medical evaluation promptly if t hey develop new -onset 
dyspnea, cough, or fever or if they have worsening of these baseline symptoms. It is important 
17  that an evaluation/work -up distin guishes between non-drug-related causes (eg, infec tion or 
progression of disease) and a possible drug- related pulmonary toxicity as the management of these 
events can be quite different. For sy mptomatic nivolumab -related pneumonitis, the p rincipal 
treatment is co rticosteroids (Appe ndix 1). All subj ects with Grade 3-4 pneumonitis should 
discontinue nivolumab and initiate treatment with high doses of cor ticosteroids. 
 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Events 
 
Gastrointestinal AEs have b een observed following trea tment with n ivolumab. Most cases of 
diarrhea were of low grade (Grade 1-2). Colitis occurred less frequently than diarrh ea. High-g rade 
cases of dia rrhe a and colitis were managed with cor tic osteroids and, in al l cases, the events 
resolved. 
 
The recommended management of GI AE s is provided in Appendix 1.  Early recognition a nd 
treatment of diarrhea and co litis are critical to their management. Subj ects should be adv ise d to 
seek medical eva luation if the y develop new -onset diarrhea, blood in stool, or sever e abdominal 
pain or if they have worsening of baseline diarrh ea. It is importan t that an evaluation/work- up 
distinguishes between non-drug-related causes (eg, infection or p rogression of dis ease) and a 
possible drug- related  AE as the management can  be quite different.  The principal treatment for 
high-grade GI AEs is corticosteroids (Appendix 1). Caution should be taken in the use of narcotics 
in subjects with diarrhea, colitis, or abdominal pain as pa in medicines may mask the si gns of 
colonic perforation. Grade 3 diarrhea/colitis requires permanent discon tinuation re gardless of AE 
duration. 
 
Diverticular P erf oration  
Given the high  prevalence of diverticulosi s and diverticulitis in the gen eral populat ion, it is 
expected that some nivolumab-t reated subject s will have th ese conditions concurrently w ith their 
malignancy. While ther e is insufficient evidence to sugge st that diverticulosis or div erticulitis is a 
predisposing f actor for GI perfora tio n following nivolumab administratio n, clinical caution should 
be exercised, as appropriate, for subjects on concomitant medi cations of cor ticosteroids, NSAID, 
or opioid analge sics. In addition, vigilance should be used for signs and sympto ms of potentia l 
perforation, especially in subjects with known diverticular disease. 
 
Hepatic Adverse Events 
 
Hepatic AEs, including elev ated liver function tests (LFTs) and, infrequently, drug induced liver 
injury (DILI), h ave been observed following t reatment with nivolumab. Most cases were of low or 
moderate grade. Higher-grade hepatic AEs, including DILI,  were managed with cortico steroids 
(with or without mycoph enolate mofetil) and, in almost al l cases, the events re solve d. 
 
The recommended man agement of h epatic AEs is provided in Appendix 1.  Early recognition a nd 
treatment of elevated LFTs and DILI are critical to their management. Subj ects should be adv ised 
to 
seek medical evalua tion if they notice jaundice (yellow app earance of skin or scl era) or if they 
develop bruising, bleeding, or right-sided abdominal pain. Physicians should monitor LFTs prior 
to each nivolumab t reatment. As LFT abnormalitie s are common in subj ects with cancer, it is 
important that an evaluation/work-up distinguishes between non-drug- related causes (eg, 
infection,  prog ression  of disease, concom ita nt  medications, or alcohol) and a possible drug- 
related  AE  as  the management  can  be  quite d ifferent.  The pr incipal treatment for high-g rade 
hepatic AEs is corticosteroids (Appen dix 1). 
18  For any g rade increase in AST or ALT, the investigator needs to ensure that it is not due to biliary 
obstruction or the intr oduction of n ew drugs. Biliary obstruction should be ruled out by imaging if 
needed. If the elevation of A ST or ALT is due to biliary obstruction, a nd the biliary obstruction is 
treated, the study drug may be restarted upon return of the AST and ALT to baseline or grade 2. 
 
For any g rade increase in bilirubin, the investigator needs to ensure that it is not due to biliary 
obstruction or the intr oduction of new drug s. Biliary obstru ction shou ld be ruled out by imaging if 
needed. If the elevation of bilirub in is due to biliary obstruction, and the biliary obstru ction is 
treated, the study drug may be restarted upon return of the bilirubin to baseline or Grade 1. 
 
 
 
Endocrinopathies 
 
Endocrinopathies have been observed following treatment wi th nivolumab.  Most cases were of 
low or moder ate grade. The events h ave typically been identified through e ither routine p eriodic 
monitoring of specific laboratories (e.g., TSH) or as par t of a work-up for asso ciated 
symptoms (e.g., fatigue). Events may occur with in weeks of beginning treatmen t, but also  have 
been  noted  to  occur  afte r  many  months  (while  still  on  t reatment).  More than 1 endocrine 
organ may be involved (e.g., hypop hysitis [pituitary inflammation] may need to be evaluated at 
the time adrenal  insufficiency o r  thyroid  disord er is  suspected).  Moderate- to high-grade 
cases were managed wi th hormone replacement therapy and, in some  cases, wi th the addition of 
corticosteroids. In some case s, nivolumab treatment was held until adequate hormone replacement 
was provided. 
 
 
Guidelines on the re commended  management of endocrinop athies are provided in App endix 1. 
Early recognition and trea tment of endocr inopathies are critical to its management. Subjects 
should be ad vised to seek medical evaluation if they notice new -onset fatigue, lightheadedness, 
or difficulty w ith vision or if baseline fatigue worsens. As fatigue is common in subjec ts with 
cancer, it is impo rtant that an evaluation/work-up distingu ishes between non-drug- related causes 
(e.g., progression of dis ease, anemia, concomitant medication s, or  depression) and a possible 
drug-related AE as the management can be quite differen t. The prin cipal management of 
endocrinopathies is hormone replacement th erapy. For subjects with moder ate- or high-grade 
e
vents, corticosteroids may also be used (Appendix 1). 
 
 
Skin Adverse  Events 
 
R
ash  and  pruritus  were the most  common  skin  AE s  observed  following trea tment  with 
nivolumab. The rash was typically focal with a maculopapul ar appearance occurring on the 
trunk, back, or extremitie s. Most cases have been of low or modera te grade. In some case s, rash 
and pruritus reso lved without int ervention. Topical corticosteroids have been used for some cases 
of rash. Anti-histam ines have b een used for some cases of pruritus. More severe  cases responded 
to systemic corticosteroids. 
 
Subjects should be advised to seek medical evaluation if they notice new - onset rash. Earl y 
consultation wi th a dermatology specialist and a biopsy should be considered if there is 
uncertainty as to the cause of the rash, or if there is any unusual appea rance or clinical feature 
associated with it. Other d rugs that may cause rash should be considered in the differential and, if 
possible, discontinued. 
 
The principal treatment f or skin AEs, such as rash and pruritu s, consists of symptomatic 
management.  Topical  co rticosteroids  can  be used for low- to moderate-grade focal rash. 
19  Systemic corticosteroids should be used for di ffuse and high-g rade rash. 
 
Renal Adverse Events 
 
Elevated creatinine and b iopsy-confirmed  tubuloint erstitial nephritis and all ergic nephritis have 
been infrequently observed following treatment with ni volumab. The frequency of renal AEs 
may be greater with  nivolumab  combination therapies than  with nivolumab mono therapy. Most 
cases were Grade  2 or 3 and  based on creatinine elevation. Subj ects with a history of RCC or 
prior nephrec tomy did not appear to  be at higher risk. Events were managed wi th corticosteroids 
and, in all cases, renal function par tially or fully improved. 
 
The recommended man agement of renal AEs is provid ed in Appendix 1. Phy sicians should 
monitor creatinine regul arly. As creatinine abn ormalities are common in subjects with cancer 
and  other comorbidities, it is important that an evaluation/work-up dist inguishes  between 
non-drug-related cause s (e.g., dehyd ration, concomitant medi cations, hypotension, or progressi on 
of disease) and a possible drug- related AE as the management can be quite differen t. The principal 
treatment for re nal AEs is corticostero ids (Appendix 1).  
 
Neurologic Adverse Events 
 
Neurologic AEs have b een uncommonly obs erved following treatment with nivoluma b. 
Neurologic AEs can manifest as central abnormalities (e.g., aseptic meningitis, enceph alopathy, or 
encephalitis)  or  periphera l  sensory/motor  neuropathies   (e.g.,   Guillain-Barr e  Syndrome, 
myasthen ia gravis complicated with sepsis and fatality). 
 
The
 recommended  management of n eurologic AEs is provided in Appendix 1. Ear ly recognition 
and treatment of n eurologic AEs is critical to its management. Subjects should be advised to seek 
medical evalua tion if they notice impairment in motor fun ction (e.g., weakness),  changes in 
sensation (e .g., numbness), or symptoms suggestive of possible cent ral nervous system 
abnormalities such as new headache or mental status changes. As neurolog ic symptoms can be 
common  in  su bjects  with  cancer ,  it is  important  that  an  evaluation/wo rk-up distinguishes 
between non-drug-related causes (e.g., progression of d isease, concomitant medi cations, or 
infect
ion) and  a possible dru g-related AE  as the man agement can  be quite different. The 
principal treatments for n eurologic toxicity a re dose delay, cortico ste roids, and 
IV immunoglobulin as outlined  in the safety algorithm (Appendix 1). For high-g rade related 
neurological AEs, nivolumab should be discontinued.  
 
Uveitis and Visual Complain ts 
 
Immune therapies have b een uncommonly a ssociated with visual complaint s. Inflammation of 
components within the eye (e.g., uveiti s) is an uncommon,  but clinically important, event. An 
ophthalmologist should ev aluate visual complain ts with exam ination of the conjunct iva, anterior 
and posterior cha mbers, and retina.  Topica l corticost eroids may be used to manage low-grade 
events. Lo w-grade events that do not resolve and high-grade events should be managed with 
systemic corticosteroids. Complaints of double vision should al so p rompt medi cal evaluation. In 
addition to ocular inflammatory events, a work-up should also consider pitu itary inflammation as a 
cause. 
 
 
 
Ot
hers 
range, delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity 
20  Other clinically significant immun e-mediated a dverse reactions can occur with nivolumab. 
Imm
une-mediated  adverse reactions may o ccur after discontinuation of n ivolumab therapy. For 
any suspected immune-mediated adver se reactions, exclude o ther causes. Based on the sever ity of 
the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold nivol uma b, administer high-dose 
corticosteroids, and if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Upon  improvement to 
Grade 1 or less, consider initiation of cortic osteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 
month. 
Consider restarting nivo lumab after completion of corticosteroid taper based on the 
severity of the event. 
 
Overdose, Warnings, and Precautions  
There is no av ailable information concerning over dose with nivolum ab. Depending on the symptoms 
and/or signs leading to the suspicion of overdose, supportive medical management should be provided. 
There is no specific antidote. 
 
Precautions for Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
 
The   nonclinical   findi ngs   of   increased   late-stage   pregnanc y  loss   and   early  infant 
deaths/euthanasia in nivolumab-exposed  pregnant monkeys su ggest a potential risk to human pregnancy if 
there is continued treatment with  nivolumab during pregnancy. Giv en the potential risk sugge sted by 
preliminary data from nonclini cal  and clinical data, dosing during pregnancy w ill continue to be prohib ited. 
In addition, women of childbearing potential (WOCB P) receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adher e to 
contraception for a period of 23 weeks after the last dose of nivolumab.  Men receiving nivolumab and who 
are sexually active with WOCB P will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after 
the last dose of nivolumab. 
 
 
These durations have been  calculated using the upper limit of the half- life for nivo lumab 
(25 days) and are based on  the recommend ation that WOCBP use cont raception for 5  half-lives 
plus 30 day s, and men who are sexually active w ith WOCBP use contracep tion for 5 half-l ives 
plus 90 days after the last dose of nivolumab. Females should not breast feed while receiving 
nivolumab and for any subsequent protocol-specified p eriod. 
 
 
 
5.2.1 Dose Delay Criteria 
 
Tumor assessment s for all subjects should c onti nue as per protocol ev en if dosing is interrupted. 
Nivolumab administ ration should be delayed for the following: 
• Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin,  drug-related adver se event, with the following exceptions: 
− Grade 2 d rug-related fatigue or clinically insignifi cant labora tory abnormalities do 
not req
uire a treatment delay 
• Any Grade 3 drug-related skin adverse event 
• Any Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the following ex ceptions for blood 
counts, AST, ALT,  or total bilirubin: 
− Grade 3 lymphopen ia or leukop enia does not require dose delay 
− Grade 2 anem ia does not require a dose delay 
• If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT or tota l bilirubin that is with in normal limits, dela y 
dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 2 toxicity 
• If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin with in the  Grade 1 or Grade 2 toxicity 
 • A sudden increase in transaminases that the investigator determines is s ec ondary to 
dislocation of a sten t will not be counted as an AE. Treatment should be held until stent 
replacement can be performed and only resumed once LFTs have returned to the patient’ s 
baseline 
• Any adver se event, labora tory abnorma lity, or inte rcurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medi ca tion. 
 
 
 
 
5.2.2 Criteria to Resume Dosing 
 
Subjects may resume trea tment with nivolumab wh en the drug- related AE(s) resolve(s) to Grade ≤ 
1 or baseline, with the following exceptions: 
• Subjects may resume trea tment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue 
• Subjects who have not exper ienced a Grade 3 drug- related skin AE may resume t reatment in 
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity 
• Subjects with baseline AST/ALT or total bilirubin in the Gr ade 1 or 2 toxicity range may 
resume treatment in the presence of return to Gra de 1 or 2 AST/ALT OR total bi lirubin, 
respectively 
• Subjects who started out with normal baseline LFT s who develop combined Grade 2 
AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting discontinuation pa rameters (Section 5.2.4.1) 
should h
ave treatment permanently discontinued 
• Drug-related pulmonary toxicity or diarrhea/coli tis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/coli tis require permanent discontinuation of the 
drug regardless of dura tion. Drug-related endocrinopathie s adequately contro lled with only 
physiologic hormone repl acement may resume trea tment 
 
If treatment is delayed > 6 weeks, the subj ect must be per manently discontinued from study therapy, 
except as specified in Section 5.2.4.1 
 
 
 
5.2.3 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression 
 
Accumulating ev idence indicates a minority of subj ects treated with immunothera py may derive 
clinical ben efit despite initial evide nce of progressive disease (PD). 
 
Subjects treated with nivolumab will be per mitted to continue treatment beyond in itial RECI ST 1.1 
defined PD as long as they m eet the following criteria: 
1. Invest igator-a ssessed clinical be nefit, and do n ot have rapid disease p rogression 
2. Continue to meet all other study protoco l eligibility cri teria 
3. Tolerance  of study drug 
4. Stable performance status 
5. Treatment be yond  progression will not delay an imminent interven tion to prevent serious 
compli
cations of disease progres sion (e.g., CNS metasta ses) 
 
If the subject appears to be deriving clinical benefit despite disease progression, the decision to 
continue treatment beyond d isease progression should be discu ssed with the Principal  Investigator 
and documented in the study records. 
 
21 
22  A radiographic assessment/ scan should be performed within six (6) weeks of original PD to 
determine whe ther there has been a decrea se in the tumor size, or continu ed PD. The assessment of 
clinical ben efit should be balanced by clinical judgmen t as to whether the subj ect is clinicall y 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued t reatment with nivolumab. 
 
If the principal investigator feels that the subj ect continues to achieve clini cal benefit by continuing 
tre
atment, the subject should remain on the trial and co ntinue to receive monitoring a ccording to the 
Time and Events Schedule. The decision to continue treatment should be discussed and  documented 
in the study records. 
 
 
 
5.2.4 Treatment Discontinuation Criteria 
 
Tumor assessment s for all subjects should c onti nue as per protocol ev en if dosing is disco ntinued. 
 
 
 
5.2.4.1 Nivolumab Do se Discontinuati on 
 
Nivolumab treatment should be per manently discontinued for the following: 
 
Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis, eye pain or blurred vision that do es not respond to topical therap y 
and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re -treatm ent period OR requires systemic 
treatment 
 
Any Grade 3 non-skin, dru g-related adverse event lasting > 7 day s, with the fol lowing exceptions : 
Grade 3 drug-rel ated uveitis, pneu monitis, broncho spasm, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion 
reaction of any duration requires discontinuation 
 
Grade 3 drug-rel ated labo ratory abnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation except: 
1. Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated with bl eeding requires 
discontinuation 
2. Any drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnorma lity that meets the following criteria 
require discontinu ation: 
a. AST or ALT > 10x ULN 
b. Total bilirubin > 5x U LN 
c. In subjects with norma l baseline LFT s, the developmen t concurrent AST or ALT > 
3x ULN and tota l bilirubin > 2x U LN 
 
Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or labora tory abnorma lity, except for the following event s 
whi
ch do not require discontinuation: 
1. Grade 4 neutropenia ≥ 7 days 
2. Grade 4 lymphop enia or leukopenia 
3. Isolated Gr ade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associate d with clinica l 
sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropria te management within 72 hour s 
of their onset 
 
Any dosing int erruption lasting > 6 weeks with the following exceptions: 
23  1. Dosing interruptions to allow  for prolonged st eroid tapers to manage drug-related adverse 
events are allowed. Prior to re-initiating treatment in a su bject with a dosing interrupti on 
lasting > 6 weeks, the Principal Investigat or must be consulted. Tu mor assessments should 
continue as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted.  
2. Dosing interruptions > 6 weeks that occur for non-drug- rela ted reasons may be al lowed if 
approved by the Principal Investigator. Prior to re-initiating t reatment in a subj ect with a 
dosing int erruption lasting > 6 weeks, the Pr incipal Investigator must be consulted. Tumor 
assessments should con tinue as per protocol even if dosing is interr upted. 
3. Any adver se event, laboratory abnormality, or concurre nt illness which, in the judgment of 
the
 Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject wi th continued nivolumab 
dosing. 
 
Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of t reatment without obj ective 
evi
dence of disease progression at that time should be re ported as ‘symptoma tic deterioration’. 
Every effort should be made to document obj ective progression (ie radiographic confirmation) even 
after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
 
 
5.2.5 Treatment of Nivolu mab-Relat ed Infusion R eactions 
 
 
Since nivolumab contains on ly human immunoglobulin prote in sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogen ic and induce in fusion or hyp ersensitivity reac tions. However, if such a reaction were to 
occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, ra sh, pruritus, ar thalgias, hypotension, 
hypertension, broncho spasm, or other allergic-like reactions. Al l Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions 
should be reported as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusion reactions should be g raded according 
to NCI CTCAE (V ersion 4.0) guidelines. 
 
Treatmen t recommenda tions are provided below and may be modified based on local treatmen t 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate: 
 
For Grade 1 symptom s: (Mild reaction; infusion i nterruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated). 
Remain at bedside and monitor subj ect until recovery from symptoms. The fol lowing 
prophylactic premedications are recommend ed for future in fusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen /para cetamol 325 to 1000 mg at l east 30 minute s 
before additiona l nivolumab ad ministratio ns. 
 
For Grade 2 symptom s: (Moderate reaction req uires therapy or in fusion interruptio n but 
responds promptly to sy mptomat ic treatment [e.g., antihistamines, non-steroida l anti- 
inflammatory drug s, na rcotics, corticosteroid s, bronchodilato rs, IV flui ds]; prophy lactic 
medications indicated for 24 hours). 
 
Stop the nivolumab in fusion, begin an IV infusion of normal sa line, and treat the subject 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen /paracetamol 325 to 
1000 mg; rem
ain at bedside and monitor subj ect until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid and/or b ronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the 
24  infusion is interrupted, then re start the infusion at 50% of the orig ina l infusion ra te when 
symptoms reso lve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the ra te may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subj ect closely. If symptom s recur, 
then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit. 
 
For future infusion s, the following prophyl actic premedica tions are recommended : 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen /paracetamol 325 to1000 mg 
shoul
d be administered at least 30 mi nutes before nivolumab infusion s. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used. 
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptom s: Follow guidelines for Grade 2 infusio n reaction as above a nd 
permanent ly discontinue study drug.  
 
 
 
5.3 Study Treatment, Drug Ordering, an d Pharmacy Reference Info rmation 
 
Nivolumab 100 mg (10 mg /mL) will be packaged in an open-label fashion.  Ten nivolumab, 10 mL 
vials will be p ackaged within a carton, and are not subject or tr eatment arm specific. The 
appearance of the solution is cl ear to opales cent, colorless to pa le yellow liquid that may contain 
particles. It should be sto red between 2 and 8 degr ees Celsiu s and should be protected fro m light 
and freezing. 
 
Treatment should be ini tiated within 28 days of enro llment. Treatmen t will be continu ed until 
disease progression, discontinuation due to toxic ity, withdra wal of consent, or the study ends. 
 
Treatment will be ad ministered at a dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks for 16 w eeks and then at 480 mg 
e
very 4 weeks until dis ease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 24 months. Trea tment can 
continue at the dis cretion of the inv estigator if clinical benefit is noted. 
 
For full information re garding nivolumab drug ord ering as well as pharmacy reference material, 
please see Appendix 2 and Ta ble 3. 
 
5.3.1 Handling and Dispensing 
 
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug is sto red in  accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temper ature, light, and humidity) as det ermined by the sponsor. If 
concerns regarding the qua lity or appearance of the study drug arise, do not di spense the study dru g 
and contact the sponsor i mmediately. Nivolumab vials must be stored in the refrigerator at 2-8 °C, 
protected from light and  freezing. If stored in a glass front refrigerator, vials should be sto red in the 
carton. 
 
Investigational product docu mentation must be maintained tha t includes all processes required to 
ensure drug is accurately administered. Thi s includes documentation of drug stora g e, administ ration 
and, as applicable, sto rage temperatures, reconstitutio n, and use of required processes (e.g. required 
diluents, administration se ts). 
 
Recommended safety m easures f or preparation and handling of nivolumab include labora tory coats 
and gloves. 
25  After nivolumab has been pre pared for administration, the total stora ge time (combination of 
refrigeration and room temperature) is not to exceed 24 hours. For details on pre pared drug stora ge 
and use time under room temp erature/light and refrigeration, pl ease refer to the curre nt Nivolumab 
Investigator Bro chure. 
 
Care must be taken  to assure sterility of the prepared solution as the product does not contain an y 
anti-microbial pre servative or bacterio static agent. No inco mpatibilities between nivolumab a nd 
polyolefin bags have been observ ed. 
 
Nivolumab is to be ad ministered as a 60 minute IV infusion, using a volumetr ic pump with a 
0.2/0.22 micron  in-line filter at the protocol-specified dose s. It is not to be ad ministered as an IV 
push or bolus injection. At the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal 
saline (per institutional standar d of  care). 
 
Details regarding the mixing and  concentrations of the dose (preparation) and administration can be 
found in the cu rrent Investigator bro chure for nivolumab. 
 
 
 
5.3.2 Blinding 
 
 
This is an op en-label trial. Th ere will be no ra ndomization or b linding. 
 
 
 
5.3.3 Drug Logistics and Accountability 
 
 
All study drugs will be store d at the investigational site in accordance with good clinical p ract ice 
(GCP) and GMP requirements and the instructio ns given by the clinical supplies depar tment of the 
sponsor (or its affiliate / Contract Research Organization [CRO]),  and will be inaccessible to 
unauthorized personne l. Special storage conditions and a complete record of batch numb ers and 
expiry date s can be found in the sponsor study f ile; the site-relev ant element s, of this information 
will be availab le in the ISF.  The responsible site p ersonnel will confirm re ceipt of study drug and 
will use the study d rug only w ithin the fram ework of this clinical study and in accordance wi th this 
protocol. Receipt, distribution, return and destruc tion (if any) of the study drug must be p roperly 
documented according to the sponsor’s agreed up on and specified procedure s. 
 
 
 
5.3.4 Treatment Compliance  
 
 
 
Treatmen t compliance will be monitored by drug a ccountability a s well as the subject’s medica l 
record and eCRF. 
 
5.3.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug 
 
 
Destruction of S tudy Drug For this study, study drugs (those supplied by BMS or sourced by the 
investigator) such as partially used study drug container s, vials and syringes may be de stroyed on 
site. Any unused s tudy drugs can only be de stroyed aft er being in spected and reconc iled by the 
 responsible BMS Study Monitor  unless study d rug contain ers must be immediately de stroyed as 
required for safety, or to meet local regul ations (e .g. cytotoxics or biolo gics). On -site destruction is 
allowed provided the follo wing minimal standards are met: 
 
• On-site disposal pra ctices must not expose humans to risks from the drug. 
• On-site disposal pra ctices and procedure s are in agreemen t with applicable laws and regulations, 
including any special requirements for controlled or haz ardous substances. 
• Written p rocedures for on-site disposal are available and followed. The procedures must be filed 
with the site’s SOP s and a copy provided to BMS upon request. 
• Records are maintain ed that allow for traceab ility of each contain er, inc luding the date disposed 
of, quantity disposed, and identification of the per son dis posing the containers. The method of 
disposal, i.e. incinerator, licensed  sanitary landf ill, or licensed  waste disposal vendor must be 
documented. 
• Accountabili ty and disposal records are complete, up -to-date, and ava ilable for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.  
 
If conditions for d estruction cannot be me t, the responsible BMS Study Monitor w ill make 
arrangements for return of study drug. It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal 
of all empty containers, provided that pro cedures for proper di sposal have been e stablished 
acc
ording to applicable federal, state, local, and institutiona l guidelines and procedure s, and 
provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept. 
 
 
 
5.3.6 Return of Study Drug 
 
If study drug will not be destroyed upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/or 
partially used study drug tha t was supplied by BMS must be returned to BMS. The return of stud y 
drug will be arranged by the re sponsible BMS Study Moni tor.  It is the investiga tor’s responsibilit y 
to arrange for disposal of a ll empt y containers, provided that procedure s for proper disp osal have 
been established according to appli cable federal, state, local, and institutional guidelines and 
procedures, and provided that appropriate records of di sposal are kept. 
 
 
 
5.4 Prior and Concomita nt Therapy 
 
5.4.1 Prohibited Concomitant Anti-cancer Therapy:  
 
 
CYP3A4 Inhibitors and I nducers 
 
The following strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoid ed during the st udy . This include s (but is 
not limited to):  
 
• Ketoconazole 
• Itraconazo le 
• Clarithromycin 
• Atazanvir • Indinavir 
• Nefazodone 
• Nelfinavir 
• Ritonavir • Saquinavir 
• Teithromycin 
• Voriconazole 
 
The following medi cations are prohibited during the study (unless utilized to t reat a drug-related 
 
26 
27  adverse event): 
 
• Immunosuppressive agents 
• Immunosupp ressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 5.4.3). 
• Any concurrent antineoplastic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal th erapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-palliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents for treatment of 
biliary trac t cancers). 
 
Palliative and supportive care for disease related symptom s (including local radiotherapy, 
bisphosphonate s and RANK-L inhibi tors) may be offered to al l subjects prior to first dose of stud y 
thera
py (prior radioth erapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment). 
 
 
 
5.4.2 Other Restrictions and P recautions 
 
 
• Subjects with active, known or suspec ted autoimmune d isease. 
• Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to au toimmune 
thyroiditis only requiring hormone replacement, or conditio ns not expected to recur in  the 
absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll. 
• Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg 
daily prednisone equiv alent) or other immunosupp ressive medications w ithin 14 days of 
enrollment. 
• Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrena l replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone 
equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune d isease. 
 
 
 
5.4.3 Permitted Therapy 
 
• Subjects are permitted  the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalationa l 
corticosteroids (with minimal sy stemic absorption). 
• Physiologic replacement doses of sy stemic corticosteroids (e.g., pre dnisone ≤ 10 mg/day) 
are permitted. 
• A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g.,  contrast dye 
allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmun e conditions (e.g., delayed-type hyp ersensitivity 
reaction caused by a contact allerg en) is permitted. 
• The poten tial for overlapping toxicities with radiotherapy and nivolumab currently is not 
known. Therefore, palliative ra diotherapy is not recommended whi le receiving nivolumab.  If 
palliative radiotherapy is required, then nivolumab should be withheld for at least 1 week 
before, during, and 1 we ek after radiation. Subj ects should be closely monito red for any 
potential toxicity du ring and after receiving radiotherapy, and AEs should resolve to Grade 
≤ 1 prior to resuming nivolumab. Only non -target bone lesions that do not include lung 
tissue in the planned radiation field may receive palliative ra diotherapy. Details of palliative 
radiotherapy should be documented in the sou rce records and electron ic case report form 
(eCRF). Deta ils in the so urce records should include: dates of treatment, anato mical site, 
dose administered and fractionation schedule, and adver se  events. If warranted, symptom s 
requiring palliative radiotherapy should be eva luated for objective evidence of disease 
progression.

7. Adverse Events 
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward  medical o ccurrence or wo rsening of a pre - 
existing medica l condition in a su bject or clini cal investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causa l r elationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any un favorable and unintended sign ( including an 
abnormal labo ratory finding, for exampl e), symptom, or dis ease temporally a ssociated with the use 
of investigational product, wheth er or not considered related to the investigational product. 
 
The causal relationsh ip to study d rug is determined by a phy sician and should be used to asses s all 
a
dverse events (A E). The casual relationship can be one of the following: 
 
 
The 5 categories for AE g rading are: 
 
 
1. Not related  
2. Not Likely 
3. Possible 
4. Probable 
5. Definite 
 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended quest ioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to p revent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.) 
 
All AEs will be moni tored until resolution or, if the AE is determined to be chronic, a cause is 
identified. If an AE is considered potentially related to study trea tment and remains ongoing at the 
conclusion of the study, the event wi ll be followed until resolution, stabilization, or initiation of 
treatment th at confounds the ability to assess the even t. AEs will be collected for a minimum of 30 
days from the end of trea tment. All SAEs must be coll ected from when the patient begins the stud y 
drug to within 100 days of d iscontinuation of dosing or until the p atient begins ano ther anti-cancer 
therapy. 
 
 
 
7.1 Safety Monitoring 
 
Safety assessment s will consist of monitoring and recording al l adverse events and s erious adverse 
events, the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry paramet ers and regular physical 
examinations. Adverse events will be evaluated continuously throughout the study. Safety and 
tolerability will be assessed according to the NIH/NCI Common Terminology Cr iteria for Adverse 
Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) that is availab le 
at: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1 /CTCAE/Ab out.html 
32  7.1.1 Internal Safety Monitoring 
 
The Moffitt Protocol Monitoring Committee (PM C) meets monthly and revi ews accrual, patterns 
and frequencies of a ll adverse events, protocol violations and when app licable, interna l audit 
results. 
The PMC, upon review of any agenda it em, may approve the study for con tinuation, require 
revisions, suspend or c lose a protocol. 
 
Data will be captured in OnCore , Moffitt’s Clinica l Trials Database. Regula tory documents and 
case report forms will be reviewed routinely a ccording to Mo ffitt’s Mon itoring Policies. 
 
 
 
 
7.2 Serious Adver se Events 
 
 
A Serious AE (SAE) is any unto ward medical o ccurrence that at any dose: 
7.2.1 results in death  
7.2.2 is life-threatening (d efined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the  time of the event; it does no t re fer to an event which hypothe tically might have 
caused dea th if it were more severe) 
7.2.3 requires subject hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospita lization (see 
NOTE
 below) 
7.2.4 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
7.2.5 is a
 congenital anomaly/birth defect 
7.2.6 is an important medica l event (def ined as a medi cal event(s) that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon 
appropriate medical  and scientif ic judgment, may jeopar dize the subj ect or may require 
intervention [eg, medical, su rgical] to prevent one of the other s erious outcomes listed in 
the definition  above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive 
treatment in an  em ergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscra sias 
or convulsions  that do not result in hospita lization.) Potential dr ug induced liver injury 
(DILI) is also  consider ed an important medi cal event. (See Section 7.6 for the def inition 
of potential  DILI.) 
 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agen t (e.g., any organism, virus or infectious par ticle, 
pathogenic or non-pathogenic) via the study drug i s an SAE. 
 
Information abou t all seri ous adv erse events will be collected and recorded. To en sure  patient 
safety, each serious adverse event must be re ported to the PI and to BMS e xpeditiously (see below 
for BMS requirements). Moffitt Cancer Center and a ll participating sites will report SAEs by 
completing an  SAE report in ONCORE, the electronic d ata capture system and a Med watch For m 
online at http://www.fda .gov/medwatch The SAE must be re ported by emai l 
(affiliate.research@moffitt.org) to the MCRN  within 2 working day s. 
33  Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug indu ced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulato ry definition, these events must be han dled as SAEs. (See Section 7.4 for 
reporting pregnancies). 
 
NOTE: 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAE s: 
 
• A visit to the em erg ency ro om or other hospital dep artment < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medi cal or life-threa tening event) 
• Elective surgery, plann ed prior to  signing con sent 
• Admission s as per protocol for a planned medica l/surgical proce d ure 
• Routine health assessment requiring adm ission for baseline/t rending of hea lth status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy) 
• Medical/surgica l admission for pu rpose other tha n remedying ill h ealth state and was 
planned prior to entry into the study. Appropria te documentation is required in the se cases 
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance tha t carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medi cal/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of hous ing, economic in a dequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, admini strative reason) 
 
 
 
 
7.2.1 S erious Adverse Event Collection and Re porting 
 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the stu dy, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be co llected, in cluding those thou ght to be associated with pro tocol- 
specified procedure s. All SAEs must be collected from when the pa tient begins the study d rug to 
within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing or until the patient begins another anti- cancer 
therapy. If applicable, SAEs must be co llected that relate to any later protoc ol-specified pro cedure 
(e.g., a follow-up skin biopsy). 
 
The investigator should report any SAE occurr ing after these time periods that is believed to be 
related to study d rug or protocol-specified pro cedure. 
 
An SAE repo rt should be completed  for any event wher e doubt exis ts regarding its status 
of  seriousness. 
 
If the investigator be lieves that an  SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the conditions of the study ( such as withdrawal of pre vious therapy, or a compli cation of a stud y 
procedure), the relation ship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Repor t Fo rm. 
 
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug,  as well as pregnancies, must be reported to 
BMS (or designee) within 24 hours. SAEs mus t be recorded on the SAE Report For m; 
pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form (el ectronic or paper for ms). When using pape r 
forms, the reports are to be tran smitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission  to:

34  For studies capturing SAEs/pre gnancies through el ectronic data capture (EDC), el ectronic 
submission is the required method  for reporting. The paper forms should be used and sub mitted 
immediately,  only in the event the el ectronic system is unava ilable for t ransmission. When pap er 
forms are used, the original pap er forms are to remain on site. 
 
If only limited information is initially ava ilable, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow- up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator t erm(s) initially reported.) 
 
If an ongoing SAE ch anges in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes  available,  a follow-up  SAE report should  be sent within  24  hours  to  the  BMS 
(or designee) using the sa me procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. 
 
All SAEs should be follo wed to resolution or stabilization. 
 
Any event that is both serious and unexpected must be re ported to the Food  and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as soon as possible and no later than 7 days (for a death or life -threatening 
e
vent) or 15 days (for all other SAE s) after the investigator’s or institution’s initia l receipt of the 
information. BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the 
FDA. 
 
SAEs should be reported on MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be acce ssed 
at: http://www.accessdata.fda.go v/scripts/medwatch/ . 
 
MedWatch  SAE forms should be sent to the FDA at:

An SAE report should be completed for any event wher e doubt exists regarding its seriousnes s. 
 
For studies with long-term follow-up periods in which safety d ata are being reported, include the 
timing of SAE coll ect ion in the pro tocol. 
 
If the investigator believe s that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of p revious therapy or a comp lication of a s tudy 
pr
ocedure), the re lationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Repor t Fo rm. 
35  If only limited informa tion is initially ava il able, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow- up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator t erm(s) initially reported.) 
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or re lationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a fo llow-up SAE report should be sen t within 24 hou rs to BMS using the same 
procedure used for t ransmitting the in itial SAE repor t. All SAEs should be fo llowed to resolution or 
stabilization. All SAEs should be followe d to resolution or stabilizat ion.The Sponsor wil l reconcile 
the clinical databa se SAE cases (case level only) transmi tted to BMS Global Pharmacovigilance 
(Worldwide.Safety@bms. com). Frequency of reconciliation should be every 3 months and prior to 
the databa se lock or final da ta summary. BMS GPV&E will email, upon request from the 
Investigator, the GPV&E reconciliation report. Requests for re conciliation should be sent to  
aepbusinessprocess@bm s.com. The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation re port will 
be used for case identification purpose s. I f the Investigator determines a case wa s not tran s mitted to 
BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to BMS. 
 
 
 
7.3 Non-serious Adverse Events 
 
A non-seriou s adverse event is an AE not classified as serio us. 
The collection of nons erious AE information should beg in at initiation of study drug. 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or st abilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
bec
ome serious (see S ection 7.2). Fol low-up is also re quired for nonserious AEs that cause 
in
terruption or discon tinuation of study drug, or those that are present at the end of study trea tment 
as appropriate. Al l identified nonserious AEs must be reco rded and des cribed on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
 
C
ompletion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or labora tory abnormalitie s 
that are reported/identified during the course of the stud y. 
 
 
7.4 Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
 
The follo wing labo ratory abnormalities should be captured on the nons erious AE C RF page or 
SAE Repor t Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate: 
 
• Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or m eets the def inition of an SAE 
• Any laboratory abnorma lity that required the subject to have study drug discont inued or 
interrupted 
• Any laboratory abnorma lity that required the subject to receive specif ic corrective therapy. 
 
Wherever possible the clinica l, rather than the labora tory term, should be used by the 
reporting investigator (e.g., anemia versus low he moglobin value). 
 
 
7.5 Pregnancy 
36  Following initiation of the investigational product, if it is subsequently discov ered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational pro duct exposu re, 
including during at least 6 half-lives after product administratio n, the investigation al product will 
be permanently discontinued in an appropria te manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary for subject 
safety). Protocol- required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must be performed 
on 
the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x-ray studies).  Other app ropriate 
pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated. 
 
The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or d esignee) Medical Monitor of this event 
and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hour s 
and in accordance wi th SAE reporting pro cedures descr ibed in Section 7.2.1. 
 
Follow-up information reg arding the course of the pregnancy, including per inatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offsp ring inf ormation must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance For m. 
 
Any pregnancy that o ccurs in a female partner of a ma le study participant should be re ported to 
the sponsor. Information on this p regnancy w ill  be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form. 
 
 
7.6 Overdose 
 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional admin istration of any dose of a produc t 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. A ll occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 7.2.1 for reporting deta ils). 
 
 
7.7 Other Safety  Considerations 
 
Any significant worsening noted during int erim  or final phy sical examina tions , electrocar diograms, 
x-rays, and any other potential safety a ssessments, whe ther or not these procedures are required by 
the protocol, should also be reco rded as a nons erious or serious AE, a s appropriate, and reported 
accordingly. 
 
For recommend ations reg arding suspected pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea and coli tis, suspected 
h
epatotoxicity (including asymptomat ic LFT elev ations), or suspected endocrinopa thy, please

8. St
atistical Consid erations 
 
8.1 Sample Size Determination  
Patients will be accrued to the protocol according to a Simon two -stage design.31 Based on pa tient 
response
 (CR + PR after 2 cycles), as defined by RECI ST 1.1 criteria, we will ei ther conclude tha t 
the therapy is effective or ineffective. The two- stage design has the smallest effective sample siz e 
with the following two  properties: 
37  8.1.1if the true response rate is less than or equal to 5% , we wi ll conclude that the therapy 
is ineffective with probability of at l east 0.07 (alpha), and 
8.1.2if the true response rate is at least 20%, we will conclude tha t the therapy is effective 
with probability at l east 0.90 (power). 
 
At least one of eighteen patients must respond (CR or PR) in the fir st stage to proceed to the s econd 
stage.  At any point wh en it is realized that this cannot happen, the study will be stopped and the 
the
rapy will be considered ineffect ive. 
 
If there are at least 4 patients wi th stable disease for 16 weeks (2 restaging assessments), the 
principal investigator will d iscuss proceeding to the second stage of the study w ith the BMS 
medical team. This would require an amended protocol to d efine a successful tria l result. 
 
The second stage of this study w ill involve an additional 14 patient s. The study w ill  have met its 
primary endpoint of response rate if there are at least four patien ts out of thirty two p atients who 
have a response. 
 
8.2 Rationale for an expansion of the study 
 
In March, 2018, it was det ermined that the Simon-2 sta ge results led to the rejection of the null 
hy
pothesis, and  conclusion that the therapy was promising, as 5 of 32 pa tients had par tial 
responses. Two additional pa tients were also enroll ed due to confusion reg arding the ev aluability of 
two patients, with best responses of PD and SD. Thus 5 of 34 pa tients overall have had PRs (note:5 
patients did not have any follow-up RECI ST assessments; 4 pa tients had clini cal progression, while a 
5th patient withdrew consent).  The study t eam would like to enroll an additiona l cohort of 20 patients, 
which would give us a total sample size of 54 patients, for which the 6-month PF S and OS rates are 
the primary endpoints to be estimated. P resuming no ce nsorship of pa tients in the first six months 
after starting treatment, we will be able to estima te the 6-month PF S and 6-month O S rates with a 
95% confidence interval half-width of 13.3% (N ormal approximation to the binomial 
calculation).  Current 6 —month estimate s from the study are 41%  for PFS, and 73% for 
OS.  Notably, the last of the 10 deaths to da te occurred at 6.4 months, and 15 pa tients have ex ceeded 
that time by an average of 5.0 months, suggesting that th ere will be a high rate of long-term 
survivors.  Thus, the expansion would provide additional va luable information on this promising 
therapy. 
 
 
 
 
8.3 Populations for Analyses 
 
All enrolled subjects: All subjects who signed an in formed consent fo rm and were registered into 
the IVRS. An alyses of the patients en rolled into the study but not treated and the reason for not 
being treated will be p erformed on the data set of all enrolled subject s. 
 
All treated subjects : All subjects who received at l east one dose of n ivolumab. 
This is the pr imary dataset for dosing and s afety. 
Response Evaluable Subjects: treated subj ec ts whose change in the sum of di am eters of target 
lesions wa s assessed (ie. target lesion measu rements were made at baseline and at least one on- 
study tumor assessment.) 
38  8.4 Endpoint Definitions 
 
 
 
8.4.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary objective in the study will be m easured by the primary endpoint of OR R (CR + PR) as 
measured by RECI ST 1.1 criteria. 
 
 
 
8.4.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
8.4.2.1 Overall Survival (OS) 
 
OS is defined as the time from enrollment to the da te of death. A su bject w ho has not died will be 
censored at last kno wn date alive. OS will be follo wed continuously while subject s are on the stud y 
drugs and every 3 months via in - person or phone cont act after subjects discontinue the study drug s. 
39   
8.4.2.2 Progression F ree Survival (PFS) 
 
PFS is def ined as the time from first treatment to the date of the first documented tumor prog ression 
as determined by the investigator (per RECI ST 1.1), or death due to any caus e. 
 
Subjects who die without a reported prior progression will be considered to have prog ressed on the 
date of their death. Subj ects who did not prog ress or die will be censored on the date of their last 
evaluable tumor assessment. Su bjects who did not have any on study tumor assessments a nd did 
not die will be censored on the date they were en rolled. Subjects who started any subsequent anti- 
cancer therapy (including on -treatmen t palliative RT of non-target bone lesions or CNS les ion s) 
without a prior reported prog ression will be censored at the las t e valuable tumor assessment prior to 
or on initiation of the s ubsequent anti-cance r therapy. 
 
8.4.2.3 Safety and Tolerability 
 
Safety and tolerability obj ective will be m easured by the incidence of adver se events, serious 
adverse events, dea ths, and labo ratory abnormal ities. 
 
Adverse event assessments and labo ratory tests are performed at baseline, and continuousl y 
throughout the study at the beginning of each subsequent cycl e. 
 
8.4.2.4 Immune Response Criteria 
 
In addition to evalua tion by RECI ST criteria, subjects will be evaluated using the immune re sponse 
crite
ria.32 In this classification, the overal l response is determ ined as follows: 
 
• Immune response CR (irCR) is a complete disappearance of all lesion s (whethe r measurable 
or not, and no  new lesions) with confirmation by a repeat, consecutive asses sment no less 
than 4 week s from the first documentat ion. 
• Immune response PR (irPR) is a decrease in tumor burden of greater than or equal to 50% 
relative to baseline. This mu st be confirmed by a consecutive a ssessment at lea st 4 weeks 
after the first documentat ion. 
• Immune response SD (irSD) is clas sified as those who do not mee t criteria for irCR or irP R 
and who do not have ir PD 
• Immune response PD (irPD) is an increase in tumor burden of greater than or equal to 
25%relative to the minimum reco rded tumor burd en which must be confirmed by a re peat, 
consecutive asse ssment no less than 4 weeks from the fir st documentatio n. 
 
 
 
 
8.4.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
 
 
 
Immunohistochemical stains 
Archive tumor samples (paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or unstained slides) will be used for 
evaluation of expression of PD-L1, CD4, FOXP3, CD8, granzymen B, CD45RO, CD68 and CD163 
using immunohistochemical (IHC) methods with commercial antibiodies. Paraffin blocks may be 
processed according to standard institutional protocols. This IHC scores including PD-L1, memory 
effector cells (CD8+granzyme B+CD45RO+), M2 macrophage (CD163+) an d Treg 
40  (CD4+FOXP3+) will be correlated with the clinical efficacy. Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue from the colon cancer will be cut and stained with the respective antibodies against 
PD-L1, CD4, CD8, granzyme B, FOXP3, CD163, CD68 and CD45RO. In brief, the slides will be 
immersed in citrate buffer solution for antigen retrieval and boiled in microwave for 10 min and 
washed in buffer solution. They will be incubated with primary antibody for 1 hr at room 
temperature and then washed in buffer solution. After 1 hr of incubation in the secondary antibody, 
the sections will be incubated with streptavidin-biotin-complex. Appropriate positive and negative 
controls will be used.  
   
Immune Signature 
An immune signature using next generation sequencing  will be performed on a ll patients and  
correlated to outcome. Total  RNA will be e xtracted from FFPE tissue s ections  or slides fol lowed 
by hybrid-capture next-generation sequencing to evaluate gene expression profiles.  First-strand 
complementary DNA was synthesized from random hexamer-primed RNA templates. Individual 
target-gene amplification will be multiplexed with 18S rRNA endogenous control and run in 
triplicate in 384-well format on fast real-time PCR systems . Normalized cycle threshold values for 
each amplified target gene replicated will be calculated. Resulting triplicate normalized cycle 
threshold values for individual target genes will be averaged, yielding a final value.  
 
Tumor RNA seq , PD-L1, CD8 T cells, Tregs and macrophages will be reported as percentage 
m
easure. The percentage measurement will be summarized using mean (standard deviation). 
 
 
 
 
9. Data Recording 
 
9.1 Institutio nal Review Boa rd (IRB) Approval and Consent 
 
It is expected that the I RB w ill have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulation s.  The IRB should approve the consent for m and 
protocol. 
 
In obtaining and do cumenting informed consent, the investigator should comply w ith the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s),  and should adher e to Good Clini cal Practice (GCP) and to 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Decla ration of Helsinki. 
 
Before recruitment and en rollment onto this study, the patien t will be given  a full explanation of 
the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must 
include all the relevant elemen ts currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state 
regulations.  On ce this essential information ha s been provided to the patient and the investigator is 
assured that the patien t understands the imp lications of par ticipating in the st udy, the patient will be 
asked to give consent to p articipate in the study by signing an IRB-approved consen t form. 
 
 
 
9.2 Required Documenta tion 
 
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the s ite will be requi red to provide regulatory 
documentation to the Mo ffitt Clinical Res earch Network (MCRN) at Moffitt Cancer Cent er. Sites 
must provide a co py of their informed consent to the MCRN Coordinating Center for review 
and approval prior to submission of any do cuments to the site’s IRB. Any changes re- quested by 
the site’s IRB must be provided to the MCRN staff for review and appro val prior to resubmission 
41  to the IRB. 
 
The MCRN C oordinating Center mu st receive the following trial specific documents ei ther by 
hardcopy, fax, or email before a site can be activated for any trial: 
42  1. IRB Approval L etter that includes the protocol ver s ion and d ate 
2. FDA Related  Forms 1572/1571/310 as a ppropria te

s
tatements,  etc.) as needed 
8. Updated Labo ratory Documents (certifications, normal ranges,  etc.) as needed 
9. Signed protocol specific Task Order 
 
A study initiation visit (or teleconference ) will be held prior to the start of any study related 
activity at the site.  Attendance is required for: 
• The site PI and app ropriate research staff 
• Moffitt PI and MCRN research coord inator 
 
The requirements of the pro tocol and all associated  procedures and processes will be reviewed 
and agreed upon prior to the activation of the study. The MC RN utili zes the EDC system, 
O nC o r e .  OnCore training w ill be scheduled if indicated with the appropria te staff from the 
site. 
 
a. Registration  Procedures 
 
All subjects must be registered with the MCRN Coordinating Center to be able to participate in 
a trial. The participating site must fax or ema il the completed  study specific eligibility 
checklist and registration forms, suppor ting documen ts a nd signed informed consent to the 
Coordinating Center. Unsi gned or incomplete forms will be returned to the s ite. Once 
documents are received, the MCRN Research C oordinator wi ll review them to confirm eligibility 
and to complete the registration process.  If eligibility cannot be confirmed, the re search 
coordinator will query the site for cl arification or additional documents as n eeded. Subjects 
failing to meet all study eligibi lity requirements will not be registered and will be unable to 
participate in the trial. 
 
Upon completion  of registration, the MCRN  Research Coo rdinator will provide the par ticipating 
site with the study sequence number. Within 24-48 hours after registrati on, it is the site’s 
re
sponsibility t o: 
 
 
• Enter the demog raphic and on-study patient information into the OnCor e 
database. 
• Order investigation al agent(s) if indicated per protoc ol. 
 
It is the responsibility of the par ticipating Investigator or d esignee to inform the subject of the 
research treatment plan and  to conduct the study in compliance with the proto col as agreed upon 
with Moffitt Cancer Center and approved by the sit e’s IRB. 
 
T
o register a patient send the completed  signed eligibility checklist along w ith supporting 
43  documentation to the MCRN via email a t affiliate.researc h@moffitt.org or via fax at 813-745-

b. Data Management and  Monitoring/Aud iting 
 
Data will be captured in OnCore , Moffitt’s Clinica l Trials Database. Regula tory documents and 
case report forms will be monitored internally according to Moffi tt Cancer Center Monitoring 
Po
licies. Monitoring will be performed regularly to verify data is accurate, complete, and v eri fiable 
from source documents; and the conduct of the trial is in complian ce with the curre ntly approved 
protocol/ amendments, Good Clinica l Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements. 
 
To obtain access to OnCore, the site research staff must complete an OnCore Acce ss Request 
Form and a Moffitt Informa tion Systems Confidentia lity Agreement (provid ed in the MCRN 
Handbook at the site ini tiation visit) and subm it both to the Coordinating Cent er. Once the 
completed for ms are received, the site coordinator will receive V PN access, logon/password, and 
information on  how to access OnCore using the VPN. The MC RN Coordinating Center wil l 
provide OnCore training to the site once initia l access is gran ted and on an  ongoing basis, as 
needed. 
 
c. Adherence to the Protocol 
 
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the prot ection, safety, and well-being of 
the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study sh all be conducted ex actly as des cribed in 
the approved protoco l. 
 
d. E
mergency Modifi cations 
 
Moffitt Cancer Center and Aff iliate investigators may implement a d eviation from, or a change of, 
the protocol to eliminate an im mediate hazard(s) to trial subjec ts without prior H. Lee Mo ffitt 
Cancer Center or their re spective insti tution’s approval/favorable opinion. 
 
For Institutions Relyi ng on Moffitt’s IRB: 
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a Moffitt IRB modification form must be 
completed by Moffitt Resea rch Personnel within five (5) busine ss days of making the chang e. 
 
For Institut ions Relying on Their Own IRB: 
 
For Affiliate investiga tors relying on the ir own institution’s IRB, as soon as possible af ter the 
modification h as been made, the implemented deviation or change and the rea sons for it should be 
submitted to Mo ffitt Princ ipal Investigator for agreemen t and the Affi liate institution’ s IRB for 
review and approval. (Once IRB’s response is received, this should be forw arded to the MCRN.) 
 
e. Record Retention 
 
Stu
dy documentation includes a ll eCRFs, data correction for ms or querie s, source documents, 
Sponsor-Investigator corre spondence, monitoring logs/letter s, a nd regulatory documents (e.g., 
protocol and amendment s, IRB correspondence an d approval, signed patient consent forms). 
44  Source document s include all recordings of observations or notations of c linical  activities and all 
reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstru ction of the clinical research study. 
 
Government agency regulations and d irectives require that all study documentation p ertaining to 
the conduct of a c linical trial must be retaine d by the study investiga tor. In the case  of a study with 
a drug seeking regula tory approval and mark eting, these documents shall be retained for at l east 
two years after the last approv al of mark eting application in an Int ernational Conferen ce on 
Harmonization (ICH) region.  In all other cases, study documents should be kept on f ile  until three 
years after the completion and fin al study report of this investigation al study. 
 
f. Obligations of Investigators 
 
T
he Principal Investigato r is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in acc ordance 
with Title 21 of the Code of Fed eral Regulations and/or the Declara tion of Helsinki. The Principal 
Investigator is responsible for personally o verseeing the trea tment of all study pa tients. The 
Principal Investigator must  assure that all study site personnel, including sub-investiga tors and 
other study staff members, a dhere to the study pro tocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and 
guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion. 
 
The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all the 
required data will be collec ted and ent ered into the e CRFs. Periodically , moni toring visits will be 
conducted and the Principal Inv estigator will provide access to his /her original records to permit 
verification of prop er entry of data. 
 
 
 
9.3 Ethical and Legal Aspects 
 
 
a. Ethical and Legal Conduct of the Study 
 
The procedures set out in this pro tocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of 
this study,  are designed to ensure that the investigator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines and under the guiding pr inci ples detailed  in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study w ill 
also be carried out in keeping with app licable local law(s) and regulation(s). 
 
Documented approval from appropriate IEC(s)/IRB s will be obtain ed for all par ticipating centers 
before start of the study,  according to GC P, local laws, regulations and organizations. Wh en 
necessary, an extension, amendment or renew al of the EC/IRB approval must be obtain ed and also 
forwarded to Bristol-Myers- Squi bb. 
 
Strict adherence to a ll specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects of stud y 
conduct; the inves tigator may not modify or a lter the pro cedures described in this pro tocol. 
 
Modifications to the study protocol w ill not be im plemented by the investigator without discussion 
and agreement by Br istol-Myers-Squibb. However, the investigator may implement a deviation 
from, or a change of, the pro tocol to elim inate an immediate hazard(s) to the trial subjects without 
prior IEC/IRB/Bristol-My ers-Squibb approval/favorable opinion. As soon as possible, the 
implemented  deviation or change, the reasons for it and, if ap propriate, the proposed pro tocol 
amendment should be submitted to the IE C/IRB/head of medical instituti on. Any deviations from 
the protocol must be explained and documented by the inv estigator. 
45  The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clini cal trial at the site in accordance 
wit
h Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Decla ration of Helsinki. The Principal 
Investigator is responsible for personally ov erseeing the tr eatment of a ll study patients. The 
Principal Investigator must assu re that all study site personnel, including sub-inv estigators and  
other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/N CI regulations and 
guidelines regarding clini cal trials both during and afte r study comple tion. 
 
The Principal Investigator at each institution or s ite will be  responsible for assuring that all the 
required data will be co llected and proper ly documented. 
 
 
 
b. Subject In formation and Conse nt 
 
Each subject/legal representative or proxy consenter w ill have amp le time and opportunity to ask 
questions and will be informed ab out the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any 
disadvantage and without h aving to provide reasons for this decisio n. 
 
Only if the subject/legal representative or proxy consenter volunt arily agrees to sign the informed 
consent for m and has done so, may he/she enter the study. Additionally, the in vestigator and othe r 
information p rovider (if any) will p ersonally sign and date the form. The subject/legal 
representative or proxy consenter will receive a copy of the signed and dated fo rm. 
 
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator si te file or, if locally 
required, in the patient’s note/file of the medica l institution. 
 
In the event that info rmed consent is obta ined on the da te that baseline study procedure s are 
performed, the study record or subject’s clinica l record must cl early show that informed consent 
was obtained prior to the se procedures. 
 
1. If the patient is not ca pable of providing a si gnatur e, a verbal statement of consent can also 
be given in the p resence of an impartial witness (independent of Bristol-My ers-Squibb and the 
investigator).  This is to be documented by a si gnature from the informing phy sician as well as by a 
signature from the w itness. 
 
2. For minors or adults under legal p rotection, consent sh all be given by the legal guar dian(s). 
The consent of a minor or adu lt under legal protection sh all also be requested wher e such a person 
is able to express his/her own will. His/her refusal or the withdrawal of his/her consent may not be 
disregarded. 
 
3. In emergency situatio ns, when prior consent of the pa tient is not possible, the consent of the 
patient’s lega l representative(s) or proxy consent er, if present, should be requested. The pa tient

These gen eral guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing  the Sponsor. The guidance a pplies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens. A general principle is that diff erential  diagnoses should be 
diligently evaluated according to standard medical pra ctice. Non-inflammatory etiologies should be 
considered and appropriately  treated. 
 
 
Corticosteroids are a primary th erapy for imm uno-oncology drug- related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recomme nded IV d oses may be consid ered for ambulatory patients with low-grade 
toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral cortic osteroids should be taken into  account when 
switching to the e quivalent dose of oral corticos teroids. 
 
 
Consultation with a  medical or sur gical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic pro cedure, is recommended. The frequency and severity of the related adverse event s 
covered by these algorithms w ill depend on the imm uno-oncology  agent or regimen being use d.

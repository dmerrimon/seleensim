SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol AI424451
Title of Study: Protocol AI424451 : A Prospective Single Arm, Open-Label, International, Multicenter Study to 
Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy and Pharm acokinetics ofAtazanavir (ATV) Powder boosted with Ritonavir (RTV) 
with an Optimized NRTI Background Therapy, in HIV Infected, Antiretroviral, Naive and Experienced Pediatric 
Subjects from 3Months to Less Than 11Years. (Pediatric Atazanavir International Clinical Evaluation: the 
PRINCE IIstudy)
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): ATV oral powder with RTV liquid (or RTV capsules/tablets for 25 to < 35 kg weight band only) at 
doses recommended per protocol. 
Subjects will receive ATV powder with RTV liquid (or RTV capsules/tablets for 25 to < 35 kg weight band only) 
once a day with food. 
Duration of treatment is dependent on a subject’s age, weight, and the timing with which a country receives 
approval and has availability for the pediatric indicat ion of a formulation whose requirements are met by the subject.
ATV/RTV should be taken orally with food at approximately the same time of each day .
Two NRTIs must be locally approved for pediatric use and should be dosed as per the local country label. Study 
physicians will prescribe NRTIs based on viral resistance results, the local guidelines for ARV treatment and 
subject’s treatment history . Tenofovir is prohibited. 
Study Phase: 3b
Research Hypothesis: Regimens consisting of ATV powder boosted with RTV with an optim ized dual-NRTI 
backbone are safe and well tolerated in pediatric subjects 3 months to  yrs who are 5 kg to < 35 kg.
Prim ary Objective: To describe the safety of ATV pow der formulation boosted w ith RTV based HAART regimens 
in pediatric subjects dosed through a minimum of 24 weeks , as measured by the frequency of deaths, serious adverse 
events and discontinuation due to AEs.
Secondary Objectives:
1)To describe efficacy as measured by proportions of subjects with a virologic response as defined by HIV RNA 
levels < 50 copies/mL and < 400 copies/mL by Roche AmplicorHIV-1 RNA Assay (version 1.5), or Abbott 
RealTime HIV-1 assay after the Roche Amp licor assay is discontinued, at Week 24and Week 48 of ATV 
powder formulation
2)Todescribe the pharmacokinetic profile of ATV powder formulation boosted with RTV in pediatric subjects 
weighing 25 to < 35 kg and/or who are 6 to  years of age, and for subjects enrolling in the new 5 -

Key Inclusion Criteria :
Confirmed HIV 1 infection diagnosed by protocol criteria
  5kg  to < 35kg, and 3 months to 11years of age at the time of first treatment
Antiretroviral naive or treatment -experienced. Treatment experienced subjects are defined by a previous 
exposure to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) through either prior treatment for their HIV disease or through a post-
natal treatment with 1 ARVs for the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT). For the purposes of 
this study, subjects exposed to ARVs in utero or intra-partum are eligible for the study, but will be considered 
‘treatment naive’.
Screening HIV RNA 1000 copies/mL by Roche Amplicor HIV-RNA Assay (version 1.5), or Abbott
RealTime HIV -1 assay after the Roche Amplicor assay is discontinued.
Antiretroviral naive subjects must have genotypic sensitivity at screening to ATV and at least 2 NRTIs 
(excluding TDF). NRTIs must be approved for pediatric use at the local country leve l. 
Antiretroviral experienced subjects (as defined above) must have documented genotypic and phenotypic 
sensitivity at screening to ATV (Fold Change in susceptibility < 2.2) and at least 2NRTIs (excluding TDF). 
NRTIs must be approved for pediatric use at the local country level.

information (eg, expedited safet y reports, amendments and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory  requirements or institution procedures.
2.3 Informed Consent
Investigators must ensure that subjects, or, in tho se situations where consent cannot be given by 
subjects, their legall y acceptable representatives, are clearly  and fully informed about the 
purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they 
volunteer to participat e. 
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
1)Provide a copy  of the consent form and written information about the study  in the language 
in which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study  participa tion. The language 
must be non- technical and easily  understood. 
2) Allow time necessary  for subject or subject's legally  acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the study
3)Obtain an informed consent signed and personally  dated by the subject or the subject's 
legally  acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion. 
4)Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent 
form and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the 
study , and after any  revisions are completed for new information.
5)If informed consent is initially  given by a subject’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently  becomes capable of making and communicating their 
informed consent during the study , then consent must additionally  be obtained from the 
subject.
6)Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consen t. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator,

3 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
3.1 Study Design and Duration
3.1.1 Study Design
This study  is a prospective, internat ional, multicenter, non-randomized study  of a cohort of HIV 
infected pediatric subjects 3 months to  years of age and weight 5 kg to < 35 kg, treated 
with ATV powder and RTV optimized regimens. 
Subjects can be antiretroviral naive or experienced ( without prior exposure to ATV). Treatment 
experienced subjects are defined by a previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) through 
either prior treatment for their HIV disease or through a post natal treatment with 1 ARVs as 
part of a prevention ofmother to child transmission (PMTCT) program (in accordance with 
multiple guidelines: WHO, DHHS and South Africa PMTCT guidelines). For the purposes of 
this trial, subjects exposed to ARVs intra -uterine or peri-partum will not be considered treatment 
expe rienced (but are still eligible for the study). 
Nucleoside backbone therapy  will be determined by the investigator on the basis of the viral 
resistance profile and local guidelines according to the subject’s treatment history . It will consist 
of 2 NRTI s approved for pediatric use and dosed as per the local country  label (tenofovir will be 
excluded). Background NRTI s should remain unchanged through the duration of the study  unless 
changes are required for treatment -limiting NRTI toxicity . 
The choice of theswitched NRTI backbone has to be locall y approved for pediatric use and 
dosed as per the local country  label and will be determined by  the investigator on the basis of the 
viral resistance profile of the subject, susceptibility  profile of the NRTI s being considered, and 
local guidelines for treatment of HIV infected children.
A total of approximately 95 subjects will be treated with the ATV powder formulation boosted 
with RTV oral solution (or RTV capsules/tablets for 25 to < 35 kg weight band only)in order to 
have a minimum number of 56 treated subjects with at least 24 weeks follow -upon ATV powder 
formulation .In the event that the minimum number of subjects (overall and/or per weight band) 
with at least 24weeks follow -up is projected not to be metdue to higher than projected early

discontinuation rate, then enrollment target will be re-adjusted during enrollment period or 
enrollment re -opened during the study  to replace these subjects.
The study  consists of two stages (see Figure 3.1.1-1):
STAGE 1
In-clinic study  visits in Stage 1 will be at Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, then every  4 weeks through 
Week 16, then every  8 weeks through a minimum of 24 weeks or a maximum of 48 weeks. A 
“visit” done via the telephone is conducted after the first week of study  participation, primarily  to 
check in with the caregiver to ask how the subject is tolerating the stud y drug regimen.
Important assessments done during Stage 1 include but are not limited to:
A Week 2Intensive 24 hour PK samples will be collected only for subjects in Stage 1 who 
either enter the study  weighing 25 - < 35 kg and/or 6 to 11 years of age or those who 
grow into that weight or age range during Stage 1, or for subjects enrolling in a new 5 -
<10 kg cohort with 200 mg ATV and 80 mg RTV dose, (see Section 5.5.1 )
Malfunctions to the venous catheter, poor venous access, or other difficulties which 
would cause time point sample delay s may be cause for the reschedule of the Intensive 
PK visit ;
A PK Trough sample (Ctrough ) will be collected for all subjects for ATV and RTV (see 
Section 5.5.2) at each scheduled visit from Week 4 through a minimum of 24 weeks up 
through Week 48,
ECGs will be collected at each scheduled in-clinic visit for all subjects, and during the 
Intensive PK portion at Week 2 (pre-dose, 2.5, 4 hours post-dose) for subjects weighing 
25 - < 35 kg and/or 6 to < 11 years of age or those who grow into that weight or age 
range during Stage 1, or for subjects enrolling in a new 5 - < 10 kg cohort with 200mg 
ATV and 80 mg RTV dose . 
It is important to note that all visits in Stage 1 (with the exception of Week 2 and Transition 
Visits) includ e a PK trough assessment, so it is of critical importance to instruct the caregivers 
that study  medication should NOT be administered on the day  of a study  visit, rather at the clinic 
after the blood draw has been completed.  An elapsed time from the previ ous dose of study 
medication to the draw of the blood for PK must be within a 20 -28-hour window.
Dosing of ATV in Stage 1 is performed only with the powder formulation, dosed according to 
weight, as outlined in Table 3.1.1 -1. When dosing with ATV powder, RTV oral solution is dosed 
at 80 mg for subjects weighing 5 to < 25 kg, and 100 mg RTV oral solution or 100 mg RTV 
tablets/capsules for subjects weighing 25 to < 35 kg. 
Once a subject has qualified by weight to move to a higher weight band/higher dose, they will 
remain at that new dose regardless of an y subsequent weight loss.
BMS will require extra monitoring of subjects each time they transition to a higher weight 
band/higher dose of ATV. If a subject is moved to a higher weight band during Stage 1 on or 
after Week 16 (beyond which study  visits occur every  8 weeks), the subject will be required to

return to the clinic for a weight band transition visit 4 weeks later. If they moved to the 25 to 
< 35 weight range or reach 6 years of age during Stage 1, a 24-hr intensive PK will be taken 
2 weeks after the dose change for the new weight band. If the subject becomes 6 years of age but 
without a dose change then the intensive PK vis it can occur at the next regular Stage 1 visit.
Intensive PK collection for the age range ( 6 to 11 years), but not fulfilling the 25 to < 35 
weight range, will be stopped when PK samples  from approximately 10 subjects have been 
collected. All subjects from the weight cohorts ( 25 - < 35 kg, 5 - < 10kg on 200 mg ATV and 
80 mg RTV dose) will be evaluated for Intensive PK.
Subjects who reach the weight 35kg during Stage 1: Subjects must immediately enter Stage 2 
and be switched to the capsule formulation of ATV and the corresponding capsule/tablet formulation of RTV.
Subjects who do not reach the weight 35kg during Stage 1: Subjects continue on the powder 
formulation of ATV through the end of the 48-week pe riod of Stage 1 and then move into Stage 
2 while remaining on the powder formulation.
Subjects who did not have the opportunity to reach Week 48 or weight 35kg during Stage 1 by 
the time the last treated subject reaches Week 24 will have a final Stage 1 status assessment 
performed and will immediately move into Stage 2 while remaining on ATV powder. These 
subjects will follow then the assessments and in-clinic study visits specified in Stage 2.
STAGE 2
In-clinic study visits in Stage 2 will be conducted every 12 weeks through the end of study 
participation. 
Dosing of ATV in Stage 2 may include subjects taking ATV powder and subjects taking ATV 
capsules, dosed according to weight, as outlined in Table 3.1.1-1 and Table 3.1.1- 2, respectively. 
When dosing with ATV powder, RTV oral solution is dosed at 80mg if weight < 25 kg and is 
dosed at 100 mg RTV oral solution or 100 mg RTV tablets/capsules when weight is 25 -
< 35 kg. When dosing with ATV capsules, RTV (capsules/tablets) is dosed at 100mg.
Once a subject has qualified by weight to move to a higher weight band/higher dose, they will 
remain at that new dose regardless of any subsequent weight loss.
BMS will require extra monitoring of subjects each time they transition to a higher weight 
band/higher dose of powder and capsules. If a subject is moved to a higher powder or capsule 
weight band during Stage 2, the subject will be required to return to the clinic for a weight band 
transition visit 4 weeks later.
10% aspartame ATV powder to 4.2% aspartame ATV Powder Transition:
Subjects who remain on ATV powder formulation in Stage 2 must be switched to the new 4.2% 
aspartame ATV oral powder formulation at their next regularly scheduled visit that occurs after 
the IRB/IEC approval of the amended protocol and informed consent has been received. Dose 
recommendation of new 4.2% aspartame ATV powder is the same as for the 10% aspartame 
ATV powder and will be determined b y weight according to Table 3.1.1- 1.

Subjects who reach the age of 12 years or weight of 35kg during Stage 2: Subject must be 
switched from the powder formulation of ATV to the capsule formulation of ATV.
ATV Powder-to-Capsule Transition :
Subjects who are transitioning from powder to capsules, either at entry to Stage 2 or at any point 
during Stage 2, will be required to return to the clinic for two subsequent powder-to-capsule 
transition visits 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the switch is initiated.
Dose of the ATV capsule will be determined by weight, according to Table 3.1.1-2 ; RTV is 
dosed at 100mg (capsules or tablets) when dosing with the ATV capsule;
Subjects who are unable to swallow the ATV and RTV capsules/tablets by the end of the 
8-week transition period will be required to be discontinued from the study;
Subjects who complete a successful transition to ATV and RTV capsules/tablets will 
continue in Stage 2 and will be dosed according to the recommendations provided in Table 
3.1.1 -2. 
Subjects are required to switch to capsules in Stage 2 when they reach 35 kg and/or 12 years 
of age. However, subjects who reach a weight of 25 kg and/or 6 years of age during Stage 2 
may, at the discretion of the investigator and caregiver, choose to attempt switch to the solid 
dosage forms of ATV/RTV. Careful consideration should be given to the time of switch as subjects who are unable to swallow capsules after an 8-week transition period must be discontinued from Stage 2.
Stage 2 participation ends when:
A subject reaches the age of 18 years
A subject’s country has an approved and available pediatric indication whose requirements 
are met by the subject; the subject will then transition off of the study and will be dosed 
according to those local guidelines.
If an approved pediatric indication for ATV capsules becomes available for a subject who 
is dosing with the powder formulation, the powder-to-capsule transition will occur within 
the study within an 8-week timeframe as desc ribed above.  After the 8-week transition 
period, the subject will be discontinued from the study, regardless of tolerability of the capsule.
Subjects who are medically stable may be eligible for a post-study drug program to 
ensure continuity of care (for greater detail regarding the post-study drug program, please 
see Section 3.2).

3.1.2 Study Duration
STAGE 1  
Duration of stud y participation in Stage 1 is dependent on weight milestone:
Subjects who do not reach a weight of 35kg while in Stage 1 will complete the full 
48weeks of dosing with ATV powder, at which point they will transition to Stage 2 and 
continue on ATV powder.
Subjects reaching the weight of 35kg at any point during Stage 1 will immediately 
transition to Stage 2 and begi n the transition to the ATV capsule formulation.
Subjects who did not have the opportunit y to reach Week 48 by the time the last treated subject 
reaches Week 24 will have a final Stage 1 status assessment performed and will immediatel y 
move into Stage 2 while remaining on ATV powder. These subjects will then follow the 
assessments and in- clinic study  visits specified in Stage 2.
STAGE 2
Duration of study  participation in Stage 2 is dependent on an age milestone, or by the timing of 
approval of a local pedi atric indication (whichever is first):
Subjects will end study  participation in Stage 2 when they  reach the age of 18 years, or when 
there is approval and availability  of a locally -approved pediatric indication whose 
requirements are met b y the subject.
The sponsor reserves the right to terminate Stage 2 if any of the following occur: a) the 
marketing application is rejected by responsible health authorit y; b) the study  is terminated due 
to safety  concerns; c) the subject can obtain medication from a gover nment sponsored or private 
health program; or d) therapeutic alternatives become available in the local market. 
3.2 Post Study  Access to Therapy
At the conclusion of the study , subjects who complete the study  and continue to demonstrate 
clinical benefit will be eligible to receive study  drug. In countries where the study  drug is not 
approved and available, study  drug will be provided via an extension of the study , a rollover 
study  requiring approval by  responsible health authority  and ethics committee or throu gh another 
mechanism at the discretion of the sponsor. The sponsor reserves the right to terminate access to 
study  drug if any of the following occur: a) the marketing application is rejected by responsible 
health authorit y; b) the study  is terminated due to safet y concerns; c) the subject can obtain 
medication from a government sponsored or private health program; or d) therapeutic 
alternatives become available in the local market.
In countries where the regimen is approved and available, subjects who are not able to receive 
drug reimbursement through a private or government sponsored health program and are in 
financial need may be eligible to continue to receive medication they received on study  through 
the BMS Post Study  Drug Program. This program will provide only medicines that 1) were used

Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and noninvestigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for an y of t he following reasons:
Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any  reason)
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory  abnormality  or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued partici pation in the study  is not in the 
best interest of the subject
Termination of the stud y by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)
Loss of abilit y to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily  incarceration 
for treatment of either a psy chiatric or ph ysical (eg, infectious disease) illness
Subject requires a medication prohibited by the protocol as outlined in Sections 3.4.1 and 
3.4.2 .
Virologic failure or disease progression which, in the investigator’s opinion, precludes the 
subject’s continued participation in the study  or meets any  of the following criteria:
Subjects with an incomplete virologic response defined as  less than a 1 log10 drop from 
baseline in plasma HIVRNA level by Week 16  (using the Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay 
for measuring HIV RNA), confirmed by  a second plasma HIV RNA level redrawn within 
2 and 4 weeks from original sample; or
Subjects with a confirmed HIV RNA of ≥ 1000 copies/mL  (after Week 24); or
Subjects with a confirmed HIV RNA of ≥ 400 copies/mL  and showing Genoty pic and / 
or Phenoty pic resistance to ATV/RTV and/or one or more assigned NRTI study  drugs
Non-compliance by the subject with the requirements of the protocol, treatment or 
monitoring.
Inability  to swallow capsule after an 8-weeks transition period from powder to capsule in 
Stage 2.
Any of the following cardiac findings:
Clinical sy mptoms potentially  related to heart block,
QTc interval > 440 msec seen on EKG,
Third degree AV heart block.
All subjects who discontinue should comply  with protocol specified follow -up procedures as 
outlined in Section 5. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws 
consent for all study  procedures or loses the ability  to consent freely (ie,is imprisoned or 
involuntarily  incarcerated for the treatment of either a ps ychiatric or ph ysical illness).
If a subject was withdrawn before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal must be 
entered on the appropriate case report form (CRF) page.

3.5.1 Premature Termination
With the exception of subjects who did not have the opportunity  to reach 48 weeks of treatment 
by the time that the last treated subject reaches week 24, premature termination is defined as 
discontinuing the study prior to 48 weeks of treatment.
If premature termination is due to toxicity  or occurs while the subject is experiencing 
Grade 3 toxicities, these should be followed with appropriate clinical and/or laboratory  
monitoring until resol ved to Grade 2.
Subjects who fail to comply  with the study  requirements (in taking study  medications or in 
showing up for scheduled visits) may  be terminated by  the investigator.
Subjects who discontinue the study  early for reasons other than withdrawn consent will be 
asked to participate in an earl y discontinuation study visit. 
Subjects who discontinue study  medications due to virologic failure, and subjects who 
discontinue study  treatment for any other reason except withdrawal of consent, will be asked
to provide a sample for HIV genot ypic and phenoty pic resistance testing at their early 
discontinuation study  visit. If a subject withdraws consent to participate, no additional study 
blood draws will be performed. 
When a subject is “lost to follow -up”, eg, does not return for clinic visits, a reasonable effort 
should be made (and documented) to have the subject return for end -of-treatment evaluation.
Subjects unable to tolerate 2 NRTIs in addition to ATV/RTV will be terminated from the 
study .
Subjects who did not have the opportunity  to reach week 48 by the time the last patient reach es 
week 24, they  will be consi dered to have completed Stage 1.

4.1.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined as follows:
A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a 
clinical study , including products alread y with a marketing authorization but used or assembled 
(formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information a bout the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The investigati onal product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
In this protocol, investigational product(s) is/are: Atazanavir, and Ritonavir. Both will be 
provided as part of the study . Please refer to Table 4.1-1 for details regarding these 
2medications.
4.1.2 Noninvestigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as component s of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be 
considered as noninvestigational products. 
In this protocol, noninvestigational product(s) is/are: Any antiretroviral medication from the 
NRTI  class. NRTIs must be approved for pediatric use and should be dosed as per the local 
country  label. Study  physicians will prescribe NRTI s based on viral resistance results and 
subject’s treatment history . In cases where NRTI backbone therap y is not covered by private 
insurance, government programs, etc, Bristol -Myers Squibb will provide treatment or reimburse 
for the cost of prescription therap y.
4.1.3 Handling and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study  drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, andhumidity ) as determined by the sponsor. If 
concerns regarding the quality  or appearance of the study  drug arise, do not dispense the study 
drug and contact the sponsor immediately .
Storage facilities for controlled substances must be securel y locked and s ubstantially  constructed, 
with restricted access to prevent theft or diversion, as applicable b y local regulations.
4.2 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
At the start of the screening period, the investigative staff will call the Assignment Center viaan 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) designated by the Sponsor to enroll the subject and 
to obtain a subject/patient identification number (PID), which must be recorded on the Case

Report Form (CRF). This unique subject number must be used on all further documentation and 
correspondence referring to this particular subject.
For subjects who meet the protocol eligibility  criteria, the investigative staff will call the IVRS 
on Day 1 and subjects will be assigned to a dose of ATV/RTV appropriate to weight. It is the 
responsibility  of the principal investigator to ensure that the subject is eligible for the study  prior 
to a second call to the assignment center for confirmation of the appropriate dosage. It is 
important that the investigative staff reconf irm the subject’s willingness to continue in the trial 
prior to treatment administration. Once the dosage has been confirmed, study  medication should 
be initiated within 3 day s, with the first dose being given in the clinic at the Day  1 visit. Note: if, 
inorder to allow for timely  provisioning of study  medication by the site investigational 
pharmacy , it is necessary  to call IVRS in advance of the subject’s Day 1 visit (within 1day 
prior), this is acceptable and will not be considered a protocol deviation. All efforts should be 
made to call IVRS on Day 1, however, to limit the possibility  of enrolling subjects that do not 
start treatment. If a subject is enrolled but does not receive study  medication, the study  team 
must be notified immediately.
A minimum of 56treated subjects on ATV powder with at least 24 weeks of follow -up are 
needed with a minimum number of subjects with at least 24 weeks of follow -up from the 
following weight bands: 
Minimum 5 subjects (on 150 mg ATV powder and 80 mg RTV) between 5 - < 10 kg,
Minimum 6 subjects (on 200 mg ATV powder and 80 mg RTV) between 5 -< 10 kg ,
Minimum 10 subjects between 10 -< 15 kg,
Minimum 10 subjects between 15 -< 25 kg,
In the event that the minimum number of subjects in any  one weight band has been met w hile the 
other 3 weight bands remain substantially  under -enrolled, further enrollment in the fully  enrolled 
weight band may be temporarily  put on hold. Enrollment will continue for the under -enrolled 
groups until the minimum number of treated subjects has been achieved (except for 25 - < 35kg 
weight band) . After this point, enrollment will continue for all weight bands until at least a total 
of 95subjects started treatment in order to have a minimum numbe r of 56 treated subjects with a 
minimum of 24weeks follow -up. In the event that the minimum number of subjects (overall 
and/or per weight band) with a minimum of 24 weeks follow -up is projected not to be met due to 
higher than projected early  discontinuation rate, then enrollment target will be re -adjusted during 
enrollment period or enrollment re -opened during the study  to replace these subjects.
Subjects in a lower weight band who transition to the 25 - < 35 kg weight band during Stage 1 
willhave a Week 2 In tensive PK assessment completed.
A total of 30 ARV experienced subjects treated with ATV powder for minimum of 24 weeks will 
be enrolled in this study, which will be tracked through the IVRS. Treatment experienced 
subjects are defined by a previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) through either prior 
treatment for their HIV disease or through a post natal treatment with ≥ 1 ARVs for prevention 
of MTCT. In the event that the minimum number of ARV experienced subjects remains

put on hold until the target of 30 ARV experienced is met. After this point, enrollment will 
continue for both ARV naive and experienced subjects. Enrollment will remain open until a 
minimum of 30 ARV experienced subjects are enrolle d (regardless of weight band) and treated 
with ATV powder for minimum of 24 weeks.
4.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Dosing information for RTV oral solution and ATV powder is provided in Table 3.1.1- 1; dosing 
information for RTV and ATV capsules is provided in Table 3.1.1 -2.
Initial dose will be determined by the subject’s weight on the day of the first on-treatment study 
visit (Day  1).
Dosing changes are driven by  weight band thresholds provided in Table 3.1.1 -1and Table 3.1.1 -
2.
Transitioning from the powder to the capsule formulation of ATV is driven by reaching the age 
of 12or weight of  35 kg.
Please refer to Section 3.1.1 Study  Design for specific details of dosing changes.
4.3.1 Dosing Instructions
The prescriber should instruct the caregiver to tap the sachet to settle the contents. Use scissors 
to cut open the sachet on the dotted line.
The powder may be mixed with a small amount of food or beverage (eg, water, milk, chocolate 
milk, liquid infant formula, applesauce or yogurt). If water is used, the mixture must be taken 
with food. The entire contents of the mixture must be consumed to obtain the full dose. The 
mixture should be consumed within one hour and may be stored at room temperature 20° - 25C 
(68° - 77F) during this time.
Ritonavir oral solution should be taken immediately after the ATV powder preparation.
ATV capsules should be ingested with food and stored at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 
15° - 30°C (59° - 86°F).
Ritonavir capsules should be ingested with food immediately  before or after ATV intake.
Ritonavir tablets should be ingested with food immediately  before or after ATV intake. The 
tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed.

4.3.2 Specific Dosing Instructions on Days of Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Intensive PK 
Intensive 24 hour PK samples will be collected i n Stage 1 onl y on subjects who:
Enter the study  weighing 25 -< 35 kg and/or 6 to 11years of age at scheduled Week 2 
visit or 
Subjects moving into the 25 - < 35 kg weight range or becoming 6 years old during Stage 
1, the intensive PK visit will occur two weeks after the dose change for the new weight band. 
If the subject becomes 6 years of age but without a dose change then the intensive PK visit 
can occur at the next regular Stage 1 visit. 
Subjects enrolling a new 5 -<10 kg cohort with 200mg ATV and 80 mg RTV dose.
Intensive PK collection for the age range (6 to 11 years), but not fulfilling the 25 to <35 
weight range , will be stopped when PK samples from approximately  10 subjects have been 
collected. All subjects from the weight cohorts ( 25 - < 35 kg, 5 - <10kg on 200 mg ATV and 
80 mg RTV dose) will be evaluated for Intensive PK.
Subjects must be instructed to take their dose of study  medication such that the last dose 
(dose on the day prior to the PK visits) of ATV/RTV is approximately  24 hours prior to the 
pre-dose sample collection.
Subjects must be instructed not to take any dose of study  medication prior to the study  visit 
on the day  of the PK assessment. 
The investigative s ite should ensure that the atazanavir powder is administered either mixed 
with a food substance or water and taken with a light meal and should ensure the NRTIs are 
dosed according to the local label, but after the pre -dose sample collection.
ATV/RTV Trough PK (All subjects at scheduled visits Week 4 through a minimum of 
24weeks and up through 48 weeks , except transition visits)
Trough PK will be collected at scheduled study  visits through a minimum of 24 weeks and up to 
a maximum of 48 weeks. Trough PK collection will be stopped for ongoing subjects in Stage 1 
when the last treated subject reaches Week 24.
Subjects must be instructed to take their dose of study  medication such that the last dose of 
ATV/RTV is approximately  24 hours prior to the trough sample collection. Subjects must be 
able to provide the date and time of the meal and dose prior to the trough sample collection.
Subjects must be instructed not to take their dose of study  medication prior to the study  visit 
on the day of the trough PK assessment, and must not take their dose prior to the trough 
sample collection. Subjects may take their dose at the investigative site after the trough 
sample collection.

4.5 Treatment Compliance
Subject adherence to the treatment regimen will be critical in the conduct of this study . Subjects 
will be required to complete study  medication diaries through Stage 1 of the study . Caregivers 
should be provided with the medication diary  at the Day 1 visit, instructed on its completion, 
including the importance of making daily entries and bringing the diary  at each visit throughout 
Stage 1. Where feasible, the study  coordinator should make a telephone call to the caregiver in 
the interim period (eg, at Week 1) to provide further adherence support. Adherence will be 
evaluated by the investigative staff at every  treatment visit through direct interviews with the 
subject’s caregivers, a sachet count and the review of a diary. In addition, periodic contact with 
the caregivers between study  visits is strongly  encouraged in order to confirm compliance with 
the study  regimen. The caregiver should be instructed to bring all unused study  medication back 
in the original container to each visit. Use of the study  medication diaries; will be used for all 
subjects.
Subjects remaining on ATV powder in Stage 2 are encouraged to continue using the study 
medication diaries. After the switch from the 10% aspartame ATV powder to the new 4.2% 
aspartame ATV powder in Stage 2, study medication diaries will be used as long as the subject is 
on the new 4.2% aspartame ATV powder or maximum duration of one year, whichever comes 
first. The caregiver should be inst ructed to continue bringing the diary at each visit.
4.5.1 Guidelines for the Management of Subjects with Rebound HIV RNA 
Levels Greater Than or Equal to 50 copies/mL
This section provides clinical guidance for the management of subjects with virologic failure 
during the study . Laboratory  results must be confirmed with repeated testing before a final 
assessment of virologic treatment failure is made.
Virologic failure occurs as an incomplete virologic response to therapy  or as a viral rebound after 
virologic suppression is achieved.
Incomplete virologic response to therapy is defined as:
Less than a 1 log10 drop from baseline in plasma HIV RNA level by Week 16(using the 
Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay, or Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay  after the Roche Amplicor 
assay  is discontinued, for measuring HIV RNA), confirmed by a second plasma HIV RNA 
level redrawn within 2 and 4 weeks from original sample; or

A plasma HIV RNA level > 200 copies/mL after Week 24, confirmed by a second plasma 
HIV RNA level redrawn within 2 and 4 weeks from original sample; or 
Repeate d plasma HIV RNA level 50 copies/mL (using the Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay , or 
Abbott RealTime HIV -1 assay  after the Roche Amplicor assay  is discontinued, for measuring 
HIV RNA) after Week 48.
Viral rebound is defined as:
A plasm a HIV RNA level 400copie s/mL  (using the Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay ,or Abbott 
RealTime HIV-1 assay  after the Roche Amplicor assay  is discontinued, for measuring HIV 
RNA) confirmed by a second plasma HIV RNA level of 400copies/mL  redrawn within 2 
and 4 weeks from original sample) at any time in a subject who had previously  achieved a 
plasma HIV RNA level < 50 copies/mL .
Subjects with a plasma HIVRNA level 50 copies/mL  and < 1000 copies/mL  (using the 
Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay , or Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay  after the Roche Amplic or 
assay  is discontinued, for measuring HIV RNA) followed by return to virologic suppression 
will be considered a viral blip and not a viral rebound. 
The subjects meeting the criteria for viral rebound or virologic failure at any time during the study 
will be managed as follows:
Those with a confirmed HIV RNA of < 400 copies/mL  may continue on their assigned 
treatment and must have a repeat confirmatory  HIV RNA checked every  study  visit.
Those with a confirmed HIV RNA of 400 copies/mL  and < 1000 copies/ mL may  remain on 
assigned treatment at the discretion of the investigator, in consultation with the BMS Medical 
Monitor. 
A viral resistance test will be conducted automatically  and the result forwarded to the site 
investigator.
Subjects with Genot ypic and / or Phenot ypic resistance to ATV/RTV and/or one or more 
assigned NRTI study drugs must be discontinued. 
Further management will be at the discretion of the investigator in consultation with the 
BMS Medical Monitor.
Those with a confirmed HIV RNA of 1000 copies/mL  must be discontinued from the 
study .
Those subjects with an incomplete virologic response defined as less than a 1log10 drop 
from baseline in plasma HIV RNA level by Week 16 (using the Amplicorv1.5 PCR assay , 
or Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay after the Roche Amplicor assay  is discontinued, for 
measuring HIV RNA), confirmed by a second plasma HIV RNA level redrawn within 2 and 
4 weeks from original sample, must be discontinued from the study .
Plasma samples for resistance testing will be collected at screening and at, or immediatel y after, 
a rebound or virologic failure. Samples will be submitted for immediate testing and the results

5.3 Safety Assessments
Safety assessments include vital signs, physical measurements, deaths, adverse events (serious 
and non-serious), including Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Class C AIDS events, 
concomitant medication, laboratory measurements, and ECGs.
Toxicities will be graded according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the US National 
Institutes of Health, Toxicity Tables for Grading Severity of Adult and Pediatric (> 3 months of 
age) Adverse Experiences [December 2004; clarification August 2009] ( Appendix 2 ). The 
modified WHO grades will be used if DAIDS grading are not available ( Appendix 5 ). Harriet 
Lane laboratory normals will be used to grade toxicities when laboratory normal ranges are not 
available.29Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and symptoms related to cardiac conduction 
abnormalities will be monitored as per protocol (see Section 5.1 for a schedule of ECGs).
5.3.1 Vital Signs and Physical Examinations
The schedule of vital signs, physical examinations, and targeted physical examinations is 
provided in Section 5.1(Flow Chart/Time and Events Schedule). Vital signs (blood pressure, 
heart rate, respiration rate, and temperature) should be measured after the subject has been 
sitting/resting for at least 5 minutes. Targeted physical examinations will include an examination 
of the heart, lungs, skin, abdomen, any symptomatic organ system, and general appearance.
5.3.2 Adverse Events
Subjects will be closely monitored throughout the study for any new or ongoing HIV-related 
diagnoses ( Appendix 3 ) and/or adverse events. Events that occur from the Screening Visit 
through Day 1 (prior to dosing) will be recorded as Pre-treatment Events. All events that occur

after dosing on Day 1 will be recorded on the appropriate Adverse Event eCRF. Additional 
information on Adverse Events is provided in Section 6.
 
 
5.3.4 Electrocardiograms
The schedule of electrocardiograms (ECGs) is provided in Section 5.1(Flow Chart/Time and 
Events Schedule). ECGs will be read by  a central vendor to monitor for evidence of arrhy thmias, 
ischemia, or AVB at Screening to determine eligibility , including PR prolongation, QTc 
increase, QRS widening and any other abnormalities occurring on treatment. A complete report 
will be generated f or each ECG, including all standard measurements and an interpretation.
5.3.5 Physical Measurements
Physical measurements (measured without shoes, without diapers, and wearing minimal 
clothing) include height, weight, head circumference (for subjects < 3 years of age at the visit), 
and BSA.
5.4 Efficacy  Assessments
5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
All efficacy  assessments address secondary  study  objectives.
5.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy  analysis will include: proportions of subjects with HIV RNA < 50 c/mL  and 
< 400 c/mL  at each scheduled visit through Week 24 and up to Week 48; (see Section 8.3for 
further detail). 
Change from baseline in HIV RNA, CD4 cell count and CD4 percentage will be assessed.
Results from Stage 2: Efficacy  will be assessed only to ensure subjects maintain virologic 
and immunologic control.
Subjects who did not have the opportunit y to reach Week 48 by the time the last treated subject 
reaches Week 24 will have a final Stage 1 status assessment performed and will immediatel y 
move into Stage 2 while remaining on ATV powder .

Subjects enrolling a new 5 -< 10 kg cohort with 200mg ATV and 80 mg RTV dose
An intensive PK assessment will be conduc ted at Week 2 (Day  14). Serial plasma concentrations 
will be collected over a 24-hour period in order to assess the stead y state PK of ATV and RTV. 
Table 5.5.1-1 lists the sampling schedule to be followed for the assessment of PK over a 24 hour 
period at Week 2. For subjects moving into the 25 to < 35 kg weight range or becoming 
6years old during Stage 1, the intensive PK visit will occur 2 weeks after the dose change for the 
new weight band. If the subject becomes 6 years of age but without a dose change then the 
intensive PK visit can occur at the next regular Stage 1 visit. 
Intensive PK collection for the age range (6 to 11 years), but not fulfilling the 25 to <35 
weight range, will be stopped when PK samples from approximately  10 subjects have been 
collected. All subjects from the weight cohorts (25 - < 35 kg, 5 - <10 kg on 200 mg ATV

There are several important dates and times to record relative to the Intensive PK visit at Week 2, 
not only on the day of the actual visit, but also on the day prior to the visit, as well as the day 
after the visit is in itiated.
PK data is viable only  if the time elapsed between the dose taken prior to the sampling (taken on 
the day before the sampling) and the actual start of the Intensive PK blood sampling (the 0-hr 
blood draw) is between 20 - 28 hours.  In order to determine adherence to this window, data 
points collected on the CRF and on the laboratory  requisition are analy zed to calculate the 
elapsed time.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.

Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In ord er to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see 
NOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such event s include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, any organism, virus or infectious particle, 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic) via the study  drug is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by regulatory  definition, these events must be handled as SAEs for data 
transmission purposes (See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or event life 
threatening)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscop y)

cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , care -giver respite, family  circumstances, administrative).
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 30 days of discontinuation of dosing. The investigator should report any SAE 
occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study  drugor protocol -
specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness . 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therap y, or a complication of a study  
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs must be recorded on the BMS SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a BMS Pregnancy  
Surveillance Form. These original BMS Forms are to remain on site. SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or designee) within 24 
hours via confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission, or scanned and re ported via electronic mail to:
SAE Email Address: Worldwide.Safet y@BMS.com
SAE Facsimile Number: See Contact Information list.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting): See Contact Information 
list.
If only  limited information is in itially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or if new information 
becomes availa ble, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.

6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug, or those that are present at the end of study  
treatment as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the 
nonserious AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Laboratory  Test Abnormalities
The following laboratory  abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF page or 
SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory  abnormali ty that required the subject to have study  drug discontinued or 
interrupted
Any laboratory  abnormality  that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term would be used 
by the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
Females who may become sexually  active women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use 
an effective method of birth control during the course of the study , in amanner such that risk of 
failure is minimized. The definition of WOCBP is addressed in protocol Section 3.3.3. 
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently  discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, 
including during at least 6 half -lives after product administration, the investigational product will 
be permanentl y discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, do se tapering if necessary  for subject 
safet y).Protocol -required procedures for study  discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy  follow -up procedures sh ould be considered if indicated.

The investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS (or designee) Medical Monitor of this event 
and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours 
and in accordance with SAE reporting p rocedures described in Section 6.1.1 . 
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form. 
Any pregnancy  that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
the sponsor. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form.
Specific Information Related to ATV and Pregnancy
Atazanavir is classified by the US FDA as Pregnancy  “Category  B” (Animal reproduction 
studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well -
controlled studies in pregnant women.)
At maternal doses producing the s ystemic drug exposure levels equal to (in rabbits) or 2 times (in 
rats) those at the human clinical dose (400 mg once daily), ATV did not produce teratogenic 
effects. In the pre -and post -natal development assessment in rats, ATV, at maternally  toxic drug 
exposure levels 2 times those at the human clinical dose, caused body  weight loss or weight gain 
suppression in the offspring. Offspring were unaffected at a lower dose that produced maternal 
exposure equivalent to that observed in humans given 400 mgonce daily . ATV had no effect on 
reproductive performance of the offspring. In conclusion, ATV demonstrated no selective 
developmental toxicity  and no effects on reproductive function or fertility  in rats and/or rabbits at 
exposures that were at least equal to or slightly  greater than that observed in humans given 400 
mg once dail y.
Atazanavir has been evaluated in a limited number of women during pregnancy  and postpartum. 
In clinical trial AI424-182, ATV/RTV (300/100 mg or 400/100 mg) in combination with 
zidovudine/lamivudine was administered to 41 HIV-infected adult pregnant women during the 
second or third trimester. The study  also assessed 40 infants who received antiretroviral 
prophy lactic treatment (which did not include ATV) and were negative for HIV-1 DNA at the 
time of delivery  and/or during the first 6 months postpartum.  PK and safet y results were 
evaluated and detailed information is available in the U.S. Package insert for Reyataz and in the 
Summary  of Medicinal Product Characteristics in the EU.  Available human and animal data 
suggest that atazanavir does not increase the risk of major birth defects overall compared to the 
background rate. However, because the existing studies in humans cannot rule out the possibility  
of harm, atazanavir should be used during pregnancy  only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk. There are no studies and adequate clinical data in pregnant teenager females. 
The CDC recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breast -feed their infants to avoid risking 
postnatal transmission of HIV. Studies in lactating rats have demonstrated that ATV is secreted 
in milk. It is not known whether ATV is secreted in human milk. Because of both the potential 
for HIV transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactio ns in nursing infants, mothers 
should be instructed not to breast- feed if they  are receiving ATV.

Pregnancy  testing must also be performed throughout the study  as specified in Section 5.1(see 
flow chart/time and events schedule) and the results of all pregnancy  tests (positive or negative) 
recorded on the CRF or transferred electronically .
In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately  if they 
suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study 
participation.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically  important. All occurrences ofoverdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1. for reporting details).
Potential drug in duced liver injury  is defined as 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND 
2. Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase),  
AND 
3..No other immediately  appare nt possible causes of AT elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic 
or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x-rays, and any other potential safety  assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by the protocol, should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, 
as appropriate, and reported accordingly . 
6.7.1 Toxicity Management
There will be no dose reductions for study drug toxicities. Additionally, there will be no 
substitutions for ATV/RTV. On-study  substitutions of nucleoside analog therapy  with one or 
more other nucleoside analogs approved for use by infants/children will be permitted for toxicity  
at the discretion of the investigator. The BMS medical monitor or designee should be contacted 
prior to the substitution, if possible.

The cost of “alternative” NRTI  agents not provided per protocol will be defray ed by the sponsor. 
Alternative nucleoside analogs, if used, must be administered according to labeled dosing 
recommendations. Subjects must receive 2 nucleoside analogs in addition to ATV/RTV 
throughout the st udy. 
If it becomes necessary  to temporarily  interrupt any study medication for toxicity , all 
antiretrovirals must be stopped and restarted at the same time (on the same day), at full dose. If 
either NRTI is replaced with an alternative nucleoside analog a ll, new drugs should be started on 
the same day  with ATV/RTV; sequential restarting of study  medications is not allowed.
Symptomatic therap y for toxicity  (eg, analgesics, anti-emetics, anti -diarrhea agents, or other 
medications) is permitted as long as it is not an exclusionary  medication, but must be recorded in 
the CRF.
The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) standardized toxicity  table for grading severity  of pediatric 
adverse experiences (Appendix 2) will be used for grading toxicities. The supplemental toxicity  
tables supersede the DAIDS toxicity  table when grading skin rash, triglyceride, and cholesterol 
toxicities.
In general, for abnormal treatment -related, or possibly  treatment-related, clinical or laboratory  
observations of:
Grade 1 severit y -Continue study  medications; routine monitoring.
Grade 2 severit y -Continue study  medications; monitor closely  with more frequent visits; 
work -up to exclude other causes.
Grade 3 severity  (with the exception of hyperbilirubinemia) -Repeat observation within 
72hours for confirmation. Subjects should continue taking study  medications pending receipt 
of the confirmatory  laboratory  tests. However, the clinician has the option of immediately 
interrupting the study  medications if a repeat confirmatory  laboratory test cannot be
performed within 72 hours, or if the clinician determines that the continuation of study  
medications is unsafe while awaiting test results. For all confirmed Grade 3 toxicities, stop 
all study  medications until toxicity  resolves to Grade 2. Subjects will be allowed to 
interrupt study  treatment for up to 14 days. If toxicity  persists at Grade 3 for more than 
14days or recurs on re-challenge, study  medications generally  should be discontinued 
permanentl y. 
Grade 4 severit y* (with the exception of hyperbil irubinemia) - Hold study  medications and 
notify  the BMS medical monitor or designee. Obtain confirmatory  laboratory  results within 
72hours and notify  the BMS medical monitor or designee of those results. For all confirmed 
Grade 4 toxicities, stop all study medications until toxicity  resolves to <Grade 2. Subjects 
will be allowed to interrupt study  treatment for up to 14 days. If toxicity  persists at 
Grade 4for more than 14 days or recurs on re-challenge, discontinue study  medications 
permanentl y.
*Note :For all Grade 4 toxicities (with the exception of hy perbilirubinemia) -, telephone the BMS 
medical monitor or designee within 24 hours of the event.

6.7.1.1 Management of Hyperbilirubinemia
Many  subjects taking ATV experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) 
bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP -glucuronosy l transferase (UGT). Hepatic transaminase 
elevations that occur with hy perbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. Dose 
modification of ATV is not permitted. Subjects who experience unacceptable jaundice/ocular 
icterus should be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine if subjects are to be 
discontinued from study .
The investigator must contact the BMS Medical Monitor prior to discontinuing any subject due 
to hy perbilirubinemia.
A post -study  follow up will be require d for the following discontinued subjects: 
Subjects who discontinue for hy perbilirubinemia and/or jaundice or ocular icterus (regardless 
of the grade of either) 
Subjects who discontinue for other reasons unrelated to hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice or 
ocular icterus but have a total bilirubin of Grade 2 at the time of discontinuation 
The post-study  follow up will consist of additional visits every 2 weeks until the 
hyperbilirubinemia decreases back to Grade 0 or until in the opinion of the investigator the 
hyperbilirubinemia is no longer an effect of study  medication (eg, it is attributable to other 
medication or concomitant illness). 
Follow -up visit procedures will include laboratory evaluation of liver function, assessments of 
concomitant medications and adverse events (and jaundice or ocular icterus resolution if 
applicable), and a targeted phy sical exam as needed (see Table 5.1 -4).
6.7.1.2 Criteria for Treatment Interruption
Study  medications may be interrupted either for medication toxicity , as detailed previously , or 
for an intercurrent illness, for up to 14 days. Therapy  or proph ylaxis for opportunistic infections 
requiring use of concomitant medications not allowed in the protocol should be discussed with
the BMS medical monitor or designee.

8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
The following efficacy  endpoints will be summarized on treatment:
Proportions of subjects with HIV RNA < 5 0 c/mL and < 400 c/m L at Week 24 :
Modified intent -to-treat (ITT): The numerator is based on subjects with HIV RNA < 50 
(400) c/mL at Week 24 . The denominator is based on treated subjects.
Observed values: Similar to modified ITT, the numerator is based on subjects with HIV 
RNA < 50 (400) c/mL  at Week 24. However, the denominator is based on subjects with 
HIV RNA at Week 24.
Proportions of subjects with HIV RNA < 50 c/mL and < 400 c/mL at Week 48:
Modified intent -to-treat (ITT): The numerator is based on subjects with HIV RNA < 50 
(400) c/mL  at Week 48. The denominator is based on treated subjects who had the 
opportunity  to be assessed at Week 48.
Observed values: Similar to modified ITT, the numerator is based on subjects with HIV 
RNA < 50 (400) c/mL  at Week 48. However, the denominator is based on subjects with 
HIV RNA at Week 48.
Response rates will be presented with exact binomial 95% CIs using modified ITT and observed 
values.
HIV RNA log10values and changes from baseline at each analysis week in Stage 1 through 
Week 48 onATV powder ;
CD4 cell count and CD4 percentage: values and changes from baseline at each visit week in 
Stage 1 through Week 48 on ATV powder ;

Intensive PK (only for subjects weighing 25 - < 35 kg and/or aged 6 to < 11 yearsand 
subjects enrolling in the new 5 -< 10 kg cohort (200mg ATV and 80mg RTV ).
An intensive PK assessment for ATV and RTV will be conducted. Serial plasma concentrations 
will be collected over a 24-hour period at Week 2 in order to assess the steady  state PK of ATV 
and RTV. For subjects moving into the 25 to < 35 kg weight range or becoming 6 years old 
during Stage 1, the intensive PK visit will occur two weeks after the dose change for the new 
weight band. If the subject becomes 6 years of age but without a dose change then the intensive 
PK visit can occur at the next regular Stage 1 visit. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ATV and 
RTV will be derived from plasma concentration versus time data by a non-compartmental 
method using a validated pharmacokinetic program. Stead y state parameters to be assessed 
include: 
Cmax: Maximum observed concentration;
Tmax: Time of maximum observed concentration; 
Cmin: P lasma concentration 24 hours post observed dose;

APPENDIX 4 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDA TION FOR MA NAGEMENT O F 
OTHER TOXICITIES
1 CLINICA L PA NCRE ATITI S
If a subject develops nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain of any grade associated with any 
elevation of serum fractionated pancreatic am ylase or lipase, or develops a cli nical sy ndrome that 
in the opinion of the subject's clinician is classified as pancreatitis, study  medications should be 
permanentl y discontinued. Future consideration should be given to avoiding ddI or other drugs 
potentially  affecting the pancreas. Notif y BMS medical monitor or designee immediately . 
2 HYPERLIPA SEMI A
For elevations of lipase in blood, follow this algorithm:
For Grade 2 hyperlipasemia (> 1.5 ULN), consider holding all study  drugs, Notify  BMS 
medical monitor or designee immediatel y, schedule follow -up visits every  two weeks if 
necessary  until toxicity  resolves to  Grade 1.
For any Grade 3 hyperlipasemia (> 2.5 ULN), hold all study  drugs until both lipase and 
amylase are Grade 1. Notify  BMS medical monitor or designee immediately .
For Grade 4 hyperlipasemia (> 5.0 ULN), all study  drugs should be held and may be 
permanentl y discontinued. If study  drugs are not permanently  discontinued, do not restart 
until both lipase and amylase are Grade 1. Notify  BMS medical monitor or designee 
immediate ly to determine course of action. If hyperlipasemia recurs, discontinue all study 
drugs.
3 HYPERA MYLA SEMI A
For Grade 3 or 4 hyperamy lasemia, the amylase should be fractionated and the pancreatic 
fraction should then be used for toxicity  management. A lipase should also be obtained and the 
following algorithm applies:
If there is an elevation in lipase, hold all study  drugs until both amylase and lipase are 
Grade 1. Notify  BMS medical monitor or designee immediately . 
Pending the results of the fractionated amylase evaluation if the lipase is normal, study 
medications may  be continued. Notify  BMS medical monitor or designee.
Once available, fractionated pancreatic amylase elevations should be managed in 
consultation to with the BMS Medical Monitor or designe e.

4 INCREA SE IN VA LUES F OR THE LIVER FUNCTION TESTS (LFTS):
The following algorithm for management of this toxicity  should be observed:
For all Grade 2 LFTs, monitor subject every  two weeks until values return to Grade 1. Notify  
BMS medical monitor or desi gnee
In general all Grade 2 LFTs or higher, should be reported to the team every other week.
Elevations in LFTs shou ld be managed as per Section 6.7.1 depending on the toxicity  grade.
5 CNS SYMPTOMS
For grading CNS symptoms follow Appendix 2 “Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Toxicity  Table for 
Grading Severity  of Adult and Pediatric (> 3 months of age) Adverse Experiences [December 
2004; clarification August 2009].” 
For management of CNS toxicities follow Section 6.7.1. Contact the BMS medical monitor or 
designee i f you have an y doubts on how to proceed after observing specific CNS sy mptoms.
6 CHOLESTEROL A ND TRIG LYCERIDES
Initiation of HAART therap y, with and without PIs and/or NNRTIs has been associated with 
elevations in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. (See Appendix 2 “the Division of AIDS 
(DAIDS) Table for Grading Severit y of Adult and Pediatric (> 3 Months of Age) Adverse 
Experiences [December 2004; clarification August 2009]”).
If triglycerides 750mg/dL  (Grade 2 or greater), obtain fasting triglycerides, as well as amylase 
and lipase (follow Section 6.7.1 for toxicity  management if elevated); if fasting triglycerides < 
749mg/dL, continue study  drugs; if fasting trigly cerides 750mg/dL (Grade 2), notify  BMS 
medical monitor or designee immediatel y to determi ne course of action. After a subject has had a 
Grade 2 or Grade 3 trigly cerides in non-fasting state, all future trigly cerides must be obtained in 
fasting state.
7 HYPERGLYCEMI A/GLYCOS URIA
If non-fasting blood glucose > 200 or urinary dipstick > 2+ positive , obtain fasting blood 
glucose. If the fasting blood glucose is 150mg/dL  or greater, notify  BMS medical monitor or 
designee immediatel y. Consult with an endocrinologist regarding possible new onset diabetes, 
and relay  this information to the BMS medical monitor or designee.
8 SKIN RA SH
Rashes which meet the criteria for Grade 2 or higher AE (using the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) 
Toxicity  Table for Grading Severit y of Adult and Pediatric (> 3 months of age) Adverse 
Experiences [December 2004; clarification Augu st 2009]), (Appendix 2) must be reported

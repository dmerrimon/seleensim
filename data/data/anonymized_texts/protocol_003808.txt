Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 81.INTRODUCTION
Please see INTRODUCTION of the BAY 11348 (CHEST -1) protocol.
In addition, the following aspects should be considered with respect to the long -
term exte nsion trial :
Based on the currentl y available scientific evidence, a large proportion of Chronic 
Thromboembolic Pulmonary  Hypertension (CTEPH) patients who are inoperable or 
who have a persistent pulmonary  hypertension after they underwent pulmonary 
endart erectom y (PEA) cannot be cured. Therefore, it can be assumed that their 
disease will progress over the years, requiring a long-term medical treatment to 
maintain their quality  of life and to increase their life expectancy .
Although the experiences with BAY 63-2521 with respect to the treatment of 
CTEPH are limited, in the light of the severit y of the underly ing disease it is 
justified to offer all patient swho participated in the CHEST -1 trial a long-term 
treatment with BAY 63-2521 (until commercially avail able).
In this context, it should be highlight edthat BAY 63-2521 revealed a positive 
benefit -risk ratio in the trials conducted in Pulmonary  Hypertension (PH) patients to 
date (trials # 11874 and # 12166), allowing continuation of the development 
program. Moreover, in a first interim analysis of the extension phase of trial # 
12166 (includes 21 patient s with a BAY 63-2521 treatment up to one year) the 
improvements in walking distance observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment 
were sustained without an y significant safet y concerns.
For further information refer to the Investigator Brochure .The Investigator’s 
Brochure will be updated at regular intervals during the conduct of the trial. New 
versions of the Investigator’s Brochure will be made available to the investigators 
without delay

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 82.STUDY  OBJECTIVES
To asses sthe long-term safety  and tolerability  of BAY 63-2521 in patients with 
inoperable Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary  Hypertension (CTEPH) or 
recurrent or persisting pulmonary  hypertension after sur gical treatment.
The trial provides patients, who have completed 16 weeks of BAY 63-2521 double 
blind treatment (CHEST -1 trial, # 11348), the option of long-term treatment with 
BAY 63-2521.
Efficacy  assessments are included to provide an indication of main tenance of 
efficacy  with long -term treatment.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 84.INVESTIGA TIONAL  PLAN
4.1 Study Design and Plan
Multi centre , multinational, open label ,one arm study  in patients with CTEPH.
Study Phases:
 Treatment Phase:
Titration Phase: 8 weeks
Main-Study  Phase: Duration until BAY 63-2521 receives official 
approval and will be commerciall y available
 Safety  Follow Up Phase: 30 day s
BAY 63-2521 will be administered orally  as a tablet in doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0mg, 1.5
mg, 2.0 mg, and 2.5 mg tid.
Titrat ion Phase (8 weeks):
General aspects:
During the first eight weeks of the trial, patients from the Placebo Arm ofthe 
CHEST -1 trial will be up-titrated, if tolerated, up to 2.5 mg BAY 63-2521 tid 
according to an individual dose titration scheme.
To maintai n the blinding of CHEST -1, the CHEST -2 study  medication 
(BAY 63-2521) is blinded with respect to the dose during the Titration Phase and 
investigators will not know at which dose level a certain patient enters the CHEST -2 
trial.
Patients from the BAY 63-2521 Individual Dose Titration Arm will enter the 
extension trial on the same dose level which they have received on the last day of 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 9of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8CHEST -1.In contrast to that, all patients from the Placebo Arm of the CHEST -1 
trial will start at Visit 1 with a BAY 63-2521 dose of 1.0 mg tid.
To allow a blinded individual dose titration, the titration will be performed with the 
aid of an IVR-System. At each Titration Visit (with the exception of Visit 1) the 
investigator should decide, based on the patient’s systolic blood pressure, if the 
study  medication dose should be modified. The respective decision (increase, 
maintain or decrease dose) must be entered in the IVR-System that will 
automatically  allocate the right dose in accordance with the respective titration 
scheme. Afterwards, the investigator will be informed by the system, which of the 
blinded medication bottles (blinded with respect to the dose) needs to be hand ed
over for the next titration period (starts alway s with the morning dose).
Independentl y from the patie nt’s allocation to a specific treatment arm in CHEST -1, 
the investigators will apply  the following blood pressure based titration rules for 
their dose decision in CHEST -2:
The individual study  medication dose of the next titration step will be 
determined every 2 weeks according to the peripheral SBP measured at trough 
before intake of the morning dose under consideration of the following 
algorithm (= individual dose titration scheme):
If trough SBP 95 mmHg ,increase dose (+0.5 mg tid) .
If trough SBP 90 -94 mmHg, maintain dose .
If trough SBP <90 mmHg without symptoms of hypotension ,reduce dose (-
0.5 mg tid) .
If any SBP <90 mmHg with clinical symptoms of hypotension such as 
dizziness or presyncope, stop study  treatment; restart after 24 hours with 
reduced d ose ( -0.5 mg tid).
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 10of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8In general, if the investigator requests an increase or decrease of study  medication 
dose via the IVR-System, the subsequent dose modification will not exceed 
plus/minus 0.5 mg study  medication.
Although the individual dose titration scheme is solely  based on the patient’s 
systolic blood pressure, investigators are obliged to consider in addition the 
patient’s well being. Therefore, it is allowed in case of study  medication side 
effects, to suspend a foreseen up -titration step and to main tain the dose.
To request an increase of study  medication dose is only possible at the planned 
study  visits Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 4.
The Titration Phase ends at day 56 (Visit 5). At this visit the actual dose of the 
patients will be unblinded by  the I VR-System.
Patients from the CHEST -1 Placebo Arm:
For patients from the CHEST -1 Placebo Arm the starting dose will be 1 mg 
BAY 63-2521 tid. The individual BAY 63-2521 dose will be titrated every 2 weeks 
according to the peripheral SBP measured at trough before intake of the next 
morning dose. At the end of the Titration Phase (Visit 5) patients will have reached 
BAY 63-2521 doses between 0.5 mg tid and 2.5 mg tid.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 11of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Patients from the CHEST -1 Individual Dose Titration Arm:
Patient s from the BAY 63-2521 Individual Dose Titration Arm of the CHEST -1 
study  will enter the extension trial on the same dose which they  have received on the 
last day of CHEST -1(Visit 7). Although the investigator will apply  during the 
Titration phase the same titration rules as for the CHEST -1 placebo patients, the 
individual dose cannot be increased above the dose received at last day  of CHEST -1.
If the investigator requests a dose increase above that level via the IVR-System, the 
patient will undergo a sham titration. Nevertheless, in case that the investigator 
requests a dose decrease (eg for safety  reason s), dose modifications are possible , but 
without a subsequent re -increase before Visit 5 .
Main -Study Phase (Duration until BAY 63-2521 receives official a pproval and 
will be commercially available ):
From Visit 5 on(begin of theMain -Study  Phase)investigators are allowed to 
modify  the BAY 63-2521 dose in a dose range between 0.5 mg tid and 2.5 mg tid 
according to the patient ’s need. In contrast to the Titration Phase, patients may be 
up-titrated between regular schedule visits .In this context, investigators have to 
consider the patient’s blood pressure (refer to the individual dose titration scheme), 2 weeks2 weeks2 weeks2 weeks 2.0mg tid

Safety Follow Up Phase (30 days)
For all patients stopping study  treatment at any time aSafety Follow Up Visit 30 
days after stop of study  medication intake should be performed.
General Note : Stop of study medicat ion and d ose reductions for safet y reasons (eg 
patient suffers from severe symptomatic hypotension) are allowed at anypoint in 
time during the Titration and the Main -Study  Phase. In case of intended dose 
reductions the investigator will contact the IVR-System, which can be done 
independentl y from any planned study  visit, and request a dose reduction (-0.5 mg 
study  medication).

4.3 Removal of Patient s from Study
A patient who withdraws is one who discontinued in a clinical study  for any reason.
Patients may  be withdrawn from the study  for the following reasons:
At their own request .
At the specific request of the sponsor ( egdetection of a new significant 
safet y concern related to the study drug) .
Occurrence of adverse events or intercurrent diseases which the investigator 
judges unacceptable for continuation of p articipation in the study .
Occurrence of adverse drug reactions, which have from the investigator’s 
point of view, a negative impact on the patient’s individual Risk -Benefit 
Ratio (I nvestigators are obliged to reassess the patient’s individual Risk -
Benefit Ratio on a continuous basis. Factors like anticipated treatment effect, 
progression of underly ing disease, occurrence of side effects and alternative 
treatment options have to be considered) .
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 14of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Pertinent non -compliance with the conditions for the trial or i nstructions by  
the investigator .
Although not intended, patients may  interrupt their intake of study  
medication due to various reasons (eg hospitalization in a remote hospital 
without study  medication access , safet y reasons, side effects ). 
In case that aninterruption took place during the Titration Phase and 
lasts longer than 3 day s at a stretch (9 missing doses), it is not allowed to 
restart the stud y medication again (respective patients must be withdrawn 
from the trial). In case of shorter interruption s, it is at the discretion of 
the investigator if the study  medication can be restarted.
In case that aninterruption took place during the Main Study  Phase and 
lastslonger than 14 day s at a stretch, it is not allowed to restart the stud y 
medication again (respective patients must be withdrawn from the trial ). 
In case of shorter interruptions ,it is at the discretion of the investigator if 
the study  medication can be restarted.
In case of pregnancy  or breast feeding .
Participation in another clinical trial
In case that the patient ful fills one of the stopping criteria specified in 
Section 4.5.7 “Prior and Concomitant Therap y”.
In case no further dose reduction is possible and patient does not tolerate the 
lowest possible BAY 63-2521 dose (0.5.mg tid) .
Patients who withdraw should take part inthe Termination Visit and the Safet y 
Follow Up Visit (refer to Section 4.6.3 ).Moreover, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility , in case of permanent discontinua tion of the study  medication, to 
decide together with the patient about the initiation of an alternative treatment.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 15of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 84.4 Premature Termination of Study/Closure of Centre
The sponsor has the right to close this study , and the investigator/sponsor has the 
right to close a centre , at any time, although this should occur only after 
consultation between involved parties. The EC/IRB must be informed. 
Reasons to close the study prematurel y ma y be for example:
If patients can be transferred to another clinical study  ortreatment program 
with BAY 63-2521 that ensures that patients who benefit can be treated with 
the compound until the drug receives official approval and will be 
commerciall y available.
The occurrence of a new relevant safet y related finding that has a negative 
impact on Risk -Benefit Ratio of the compound.
Should the study /centre be closed prematurely , all study  materials (except 
documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be returned to the sponsor. 
The investigator will retain all other document s until notification given by the 
sponsor for destruction.

4.5.3 Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups
Not applicable
4.5.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose selection for this study  was based on the following rati onale:
The dose range of 1.0 -2.5 mg tid was tested in health y volunteers in a multiple -
dose study  (study  11260). The highest dose of 2.5 mg tid showed a clear increase in 
adverse events and further escalation was stopped. A dose of 0.5 mg was identified 
in healthy  volunteers (study  11258) as the no-effect dose while 1.0 mg alread y 
showed clinicall y relevant hemody namic effects in some patients in the proof of 
concept study  11874. In the same study  a strong lowering of sy stemic blood pressure 
was observed in one patient at the highest dose level (5 mg). Therefore 1.0 mg tid 
was selected as the minimal dose and 2.5 mg tid as the maximum dose for further 
studies in patients (for further details refer to the Investigator Brochure). In an 
ongoing Phase II trial (12166) in patients with PAH and CTEPH the respective dose 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 17of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8range is tested in combination with an individual dose titration scheme. Based on 
interim analy ses doses between 1.0 mg tid and 2.5 mg tid are effective and safe.
4.5.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
BAY 63-2521 will be administered tid as I R tablets with or without food. 
During the eight week sTitration Phase, patients from the Placebo Arm of CHEST -1 
trial will be up-titrated, if tolerated, to BAY 63-2521 2.5 mg tid according to the 
individual dose titration scheme. In contrast to that, patients from the CHEST -1 
Individual Dose Titration Arm will remain on their “optimal dose” from CHEST -1 
(for further details refer to Section 4.1).
After an individual BAY 63-2521 dose has been determined all patients will enter 
the Main -Study  Phase (Visit 5) . During the Main -Study  Phase investigators are 
allowed to modify  the BAY 63-2521 dose according to the patient ’s need. In 
contrast to the Titration Phase, patients may  be up-titrated between regular schedule 
visits. The maximum allowed BAY 63-2521 dose is 2.5 mg tid, the minimum 0.5 mg 
tid (for further details refer to Section 4.1).
4.5.6 Blinding
Titration P hase:
To ensure the blinding of the treatment regimen of CHEST -1 study , the dosing of 
BAY 63-2521 will be kept blinded during the Titration Phase of CHEST -2.
Main Study Phase:
During the Main-Study Phase the blinding of dosing will be removed and patien ts 
will be treated with “open label ” medication .
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 18of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 84.5.7 Concomitant Therapy
Titration Phase
The intake of the following concomitant medications is not allowed during the 
Titration Phase of the trial (after Visit 5 concomitant treatment is allowed) :
Endothelin Receptor Antagonists
Prostacy clinAnalogues
Patients, who require respective medications during the Titration Phase , need to be 
withdrawn from the study ( refer to Section 4.3“Removal o f Patients from Study ”).
Titration Phase and Main -Study Phase
The intake of the following concomitant medications is not allowed during the 
Titration Phase and the Main -Study  Phase of the trial:
Specific (egSildenafil or Tadalafil) or unspecific Phosphodi esterase 
Inhibitors ( egDipy ridamole, Theophy lline)
NO donors ( egNitrates)
Patients, who require respective medications, need to be withdrawn from the study 
(refer to Section 4.3“Removal of Patients from Study ”).
Other concomi tant therapy:
Due to possible pharmacokinetic interactions between BAY 63-2521 and 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg Ketoconazol) concomitant treatment should 
be applied with caution (eg additional blood pressure monitoring). Such 
drugs may significantl y increa se BAY 63-2521 plasma concentrations. In 
this context, dose reduction of BAY 63-2521 should be considered (eg –0.5 
mg tid), in particular if the patient suffers a clinical relevant decrease in 
blood pressure (eg systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg with clini cal 
symptoms). For further information refer to the Investigator Brochure.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 19of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Antacids like aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (eg Maaloxan ®) 
should not be taken simultaneously  with BAY 63-2521, because a negative 
impact on the bioavailability  of the study drug has been observed (please 
refer to the Investigator Brochure). To avoid such kind of interaction, 
antacids should be taken 1 hour after intake of BAY 63-2521 at the earliest.
Pre-and co-treatment with Omeprazole led to a decrease in BAY 63-2521 
bioavailability , indicating a lower bioavailability  of BAY 63-2521 in neutral 
versus acidic milieu (for further information refer to the Investigator 
Brochure).
Preliminary  inspection of trough and peak plasma concentrations of 
BAY 63-2521 and BAY 60-4552 (Main BAY 63-2521 metabolite) in a 
cohort of patient s treated with bosentan (n=6) compared to the patient s not 
treated with bosentan (n=66) clearl y indicate a decrease in 
BAY 63-2521/BAY 60-4552 plasma exposure, most probably  due to the 
known CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing effects of concomitant bosentan. 
However, patient s treated with bosentan profited in about the same 
magnitude in the 6 minute walk test as patient s in the therapy  naïve cohort 
did (for further information refer to the Investigator Brochure, trial 1 2166).
Participation at a supportive physical training program , defined as a 
structured exercise and rehabilitation program supervised by a physician 
and/or a physiotherapist is not allowed during the Titration Phase of the 
study .However, later on during the Main Study  Phase participation at 
respective training program is allowed, but need to be documented in the 
electronic CRF.
Concomitant treatment in case of clinical deterioration:
In case of a clinical lyrelevant deterioration of the patient’s signs orsymptoms of 
pulmonary  hypertension the investigator may consider starting an alternative 
treatment at his own discretion at an y point in time .
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 20of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8In case that the administration of the treatment is in conflict with the limitations 
mentioned above, the treatm ent with the study  drug needs to be terminated (refer to 
Section 4.3“Removal of Patients from Study ”).
Due to possible synergist iceffects on blood pressure Phosphodiesterase Type-5 
Inhibitors should only be administered after an appropriate wash out time of 24 
hours after last intake of BAY 63-2521 .
4.5.8 Treatment Compliance
The packages of the investigational drug have to be brought back to the 
investigational site, and tablets will be counted for a compliance check. The 
respective compliance should be between 80% and 120% of calculated dose. 
Moreover, plasma concentrations will give additional information about patients' 
compliance.
4.6 Study Variables
The objective of the trial is to assess safet y and tolerability of long -term treatment 
of BAY 63-2521 in patients with CTEPH. In addition, efficacy  assessments are

pressure and heart rate will be measured .
Subsequently , the patients will be allocated via the IVR-System to their individual 
BAY 63-2521 starting dose. In this context, the IVR-System will consider the 
patient’s treatment arm allocation from the CHEST -1 trial (for further details refer 
to Section 4.1).
Two to three hours after the first intake of study medication, blood pressure and 
heart rate measurement will be repeated (for further details about the order of the 
procedures and the temporal relationship refer to Section 10.1).
Between six to eight hours after first study  medication intake, the patients should
take the second dose of study  medication (second measurement cycle). One to zero 
hours before intake of second dose of study  medication, blood pressure and heart 
rate will be measured , pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected and a 12-
lead electrocardiogram will be recorded .2-3 hours after intake of second dose of 
study  medication the blood pressure and heart rate should be measured (for further 
details about the order of the procedures and the temporal relationship refer to 
Section 10.1).
In addition to the measurements related to the measurement cycles Adverse Events 
will be questioned and documented. Adverse events that occur before intake of first 
dose of CHEST -2 medication will be allocated to CHEST -1.

worsening Pulmonary  Hypertension.
Persistent decrease of more than 15 % from baseline or more than 30% 
compared to the last study  related measurement in 6MWD due to worsening 
pulmonary  hypertensionb.
The persistence of the decrease has to be confirmed by a second measurement 
performed after 14 day s. In case that the period between first occurrence of the 
event and the Termination Visit is less than 14 days, the decrease needs to be 
confirmed at the Termination Visit.
Persistent worsening of functional class due to deterioration of Pulmonary  
Hypertensionb:
Patients who deteriorate from class II or III to class IV: The persistence of 
worsening has to be confirmed by a second measurement performed after 14 
days. In case that the period between first occurrence of the event and the 
Termination Visit is less than 14 days, the decrease needs to be confirmed at 
the Termination Visit.
Other Events of Special Interest
The first occurrence of the following event of special interest needs to be 
documented in the electronic CRF, but will not b e considered for the calculation of 
the combined end point “Time To Clinical Worsening”:
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 35of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Initiation of a supplemental long-term oxygen therapy  (=oxygen application 
for more than 30 days at a stretch )or persistent modification of a pre-existing 
supplement al long term oxy gen therap y (ie need for a persistent increase of the 
amount of delivered oxygen for more than 30 days) due to worsening 
pulmonary  hypertension.b
aTransient deteriorations of clinical status requiring hospitalization, treatable by eg short time 
application of iv diuretics, positive inotropic agents or non -invasive ventilation and allowing patients 
discharge within 48 hours are not considered as persistent with respect to the event of special interest 
definition.
bIn case of clinical deteri oration the investigator has to assess carefully if the deterioration of the 
patient’s condition (eg worsening functional class) is related to the underlying pulmonar y 
hypertension or can be explained by an alternative cause (eg transient infection, muscul oskeletal 
disease, surgical or medical intervention other than PH related, exacerbation of a concomitant lung 
disease, lacking compliance of medication intake). Only persistent clinical deteriorations caused by 
the underlying pulmonary hypertension will be considered as events of special interest.
cAlthough it is only allowed to include patient sinto theCHEST -1trial considered as technically 
inoperable or with persisting/recurrent PH after PEA, it cannot be excluded that in exceptional cases, 
patients who’s pulmonary hypertension considerably deteriorates will undergo rescue PEA during 
CHEST -2. In this case, respective events will be considered as an event of special interest.
Frequency : At every  visit with the ex ception of Visit 1 and Safety  Follow -Up Vi sit 
the investigator must check if an event of special interest has occurred in the period 
between start and termination of the study  drug treatment. With respect to each 
subcategory  (eg “hospitalization due to persistent worsening of pulmonary  
hypertensio n”) it is only  necessary  to document the first occurrence of such an event

For further details refer to Section 10.7 andSection 10.8.
Use of healthcare resources
Forhealth economic calculations (see section 4.6.1 ) investigators need to collect 
information about the use of healthcare resources. This includes information about:
Visits at healthcare professionals (eg t ype of healthcare profe ssional visited)
Hospitalizations and rehabilitation procedures (eg start and stop date of 
hospitalization)
Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (eg ty pe of diagnostic procedure)
Frequency : From Visit 2 until Visit 6 investigators need to collect on a ong oing 
basis information about health care resources that the patient uses since intake of the 
first dose of CHEST -2 study  medication. The respective information will be 
recorded in the electronic CRF.
4.6.5 Drug Concentration Measurements
For investigation of drug exposure and potential relationships to drug effects, 
plasma concentrations of BAY 63-2521 (and its main metabolite BAY 60-4552 ) 
will be determined at the times given in the Trial Flow Chart (see Section 10.1) and 
in the Appe ndix 10.2 using a sparse sampling approach in all participating patients .
Frequency : Visit 1 and Visit 5
BAY 63-2521 and metabolite M -1 (BAY 60-4552 ) concentrations in plasma will be 
measured by a validated HPLC-MS/MS method. Quality  control (QC) and 
calibration samples will be anal yzed concurrently with study  samples. The results of 
QC samples will be reported together with concentrations in unknown samples in 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 37of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8the MRR of this study . Drug concentrations are calculated from the 
chromatographic raw data in accordance with current Bayer guidelines (see Section 
9). The data are evaluated using CCW software in its most recentl y released 
version.
4.7 Data Quality
Monitoring and auditing proce dures defined/agreed by  the sponsor will be followed, 
in order to comply  with GCP guidelines. Each centre will be visited at regular 
intervals by a monitor to ensure compliance with the study  protocol, GCP and legal 
aspects. This will include on-site check ing of the case report forms (CRF) for 
completeness and clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification 
of administrative matters.
4.8 Documentation
An electronic data capture system will be used in this study  (electronic CRF). All 
entries made in the electronic CRF must be verifiable against source documents.  
The source data parameter to be verified and the identification of the source 
document must be documented. The study  file and all source data should be retained 
until notification given by the sponsor for destruction.
5.ETHICAL  AND LEGAL  ASPECTS
5.1 Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB)
Documented approval from appropriate Ethics Committee(s)/I RBs will be obtained 
for all participating cente rs/countries prior to study  start, according to GCP, local 
laws, regulations and organizations. When necessary , an extension, amendment or 
renewal of the Ethics Committee approval must be obtained and also forwarded to 
the sponsor. The Ethics Committees must supply  to the sponsor, upon request, a list 
of the Ethics Committee members involved in the vote and a statement to confirm 
that the Ethics Committee is organized and operates according to GCP and 
applicable laws and regulations.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 85.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The procedures set out in this protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study , are designed to ensure that the sponsor and investigator 
abide by Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and under the guiding principles 
detailed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study  will also be carried out in keeping 
with applicable local law(s) and regulation(s). This may include an inspection by 
the sponsor representatives and/or Regulatory  Authority  representatives at any time.  
The investigator must agree to the inspection of study -related records by the 
Regulatory  Authority /sponsor representatives, and must allow direct access to 
source documents to the Regulatory  Authority /sponsor representatives.  
Mod ifications to the study  protocol will not be implemented by  either the sponsor or 
the investigator without agreement by both parties. However, the investigator may 
implement a deviation form, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to the trial patient s without prior EC/IRB/Sponsor approval/favorable 
opinion. As soon as possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for 
it and if appropriate the proposed protocol amendment should be submitted to the 
EC/IRB/Sponsor. Any deviations from the protocol must be fully explained and 
documented b y the investigator.
5.3 Regulatory Authority Approvals/Authorizations
Regulatory  Authority  approvals/authorizations/ notifications, where required, must 
be in place and fully  documented prior to study  start.
5.4 Patient Information and Consent
A core Information and Informed Consent Form will be provided. Prior to the 
beginning of the study , the investigator must have the ECs/IRB written 
approval/favorable opinion of the written Informed Consent Form and any other 
written information to be provided to patient s. The written approval of the EC/IRB 
together with the approved Patient Information/Informed Consent Forms must be 
filed in the study  files.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 39of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedure 
takes place. Participation in the study  and date of informed consent given by the

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 86.STATISTICAL  METHODS AND DETERMINA TION OF  SAMPLE 
SIZE
6.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The aim of this long-term extension study  is primarily the assessment ofsafety  and 
tolerability , so no single primary  variable has been identified. Patient numbers will 
be determined by those completing the CHEST -1 study  and willing to enter the 
CHEST -2 study. As the extension is of an open label design with no comparator 
group , all statistical analy ses will be descriptive. The summary  tables will be 
presented for the overall group of patient s, and also split by previous treatment 
group in CHEST -1. Baselin e will be week 0 in CHEST -1(changed with amendment 
8). 
Statistical analysis of safety variables
For the analysis of safet y, all patient s entering CHEST -2 and receiving 
BAY 63-2521 will be included. For treatment -emergent adverse events, ECG and 
laborator y test abnormalities, frequency  counts of incidence rates during the 
extension period (changed with amendment 8) and incidence per 100 patient years 
at risk will be presented.  For ECG and laboratory  test measurements , vital signs, 
changes from baseline will also be summarized using descriptive methods (mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum).
Statistical analyses of other variables
Patient s will be included in these analy ses if they areincluded in the safety analy sis 
and have both baseline and post-baseline data available for the variable being 
analyzed. For Time To Clinical Worsening, incidence tables of the overall rate and 
the particular event leading to clinical worsening will be presented, together with 
the Kaplan -Meier survival curve. Change in Borg CR 10 Scale or Modified Borg 
Dyspnoea Scale and functional class at each visit will be summarized by frequenc y 
counts. Patients with data on the Borg CR10 Scale and patients with data on the 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 41of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale will be combined in the statistical analysis. Change 
in 6MWD ,NT pro-BNP , EQ-5D and LPHat each visit will be summarized using 
descriptive methods.
The study  endpoints related to health care resource utilization will be summarized 
using appropriate statistical methods: categorica l variables by frequency  tables and 
continuous variables by sample statistics.  It is envisaged that all endpoints will be 
measured either on a semi -continuous scale or have ordered categories, and so 
exploratory  statistical tests will be ANCOVA or the stratified Wilcoxon test, 
depending on the distribution.
Statistical summaries
It is planned to produce two formal statistical summaries.  The first will be when all 
patients enrolled in the long-term extension at Last Patient First Treatment of the 
CHEST -1 study  have reached Visit 5 and the CHEST -1 study  has been unblinded 
(changed with amendment 8) . The second will be at the conclusion of this extension 
study .Additional summaries will be performed, at least on a yearly basis, to 
monitor long -term safet y.
6.2 Determination of Sample Size
Not applicable
7.ADVERSE EVENTS
7.1 Contraindications/ Warnings/Precautions /Interactions /Undesirable 
Effects
The potential for drug -drug pharmacod ynamic interactions, leading to an 
exaggerated vasodilatation and excess blood pressure d rop should alway s be 
considered if patients are treated concomitantly  with other drugs with vasoactive 
properties.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 42of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Concomitant treatment with specific or unspecific Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors 
leading to higher production and decreased degradation of cGMP is not allowed 
during the trial (refer to Section 4.5.7 “concomitant therap y”).
Due to possible pharmacody namic interactions, BAY 63-2521 must not be 
administered together with NO donors/nitrates (refer to Section 4.5.7 “concomitant 
therap y”).
Due to possible pharmacokinetic interactions between BAY 63-2521 and strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg Ketoconazol) concomitant treatment should be applied with 
caution (eg additional blood pressure monitoring). Such drugs may significantly 
increase BAY 63-2521 plasma concentrations. In this context, dose reduction of 
BAY 63-2521 should be considered (eg –0.5 mg tid), in particular if the patient 
suffers a clinical relevant decrease in blood pressure (eg sy stolic b lood pressure <90 
mmHg with clinical symptoms). For further information refer to the Investigator 
Brochure.
Antacids like aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (eg Maaloxan ®) should 
not be taken simultaneously  with BAY 63-2521, because a negative impact on the 
bioavailability  of the study  drug has been observed (please refer to the Investigator 
Brochure). To avoid such kind of interaction, antacids should be taken 1 hour after 
intake of BAY 63-2521 at the earliest.
Pre-and co-treatment with Omeprazole led to a decrease in BAY 63-2521 
bioavailability , indicating a lower bioavailability  of BAY 63-2521 in neutral versus 
acidic milieu (for further information refer to the Investigator Brochure).
Preliminary  inspection of trough and peak plasma concentrations of BAY 63-2521 
and BAY 60-4552 (Main BAY 63-2521 metabolite) in a cohort of patient s treated 
with bosentan (n=6) compared to the patient s not treated with bosentan (n=66) 
clearl y indicate a decrease in BAY 63-2521/BAY 60-4552 plasma exposure, most 
probably due to the known CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing effects of concomitant 
bosentan. However, patient s treated with bosentan profited in about the same 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 43of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8magnitude in the 6 minute walk test as patient s in the therapy  naïve cohort did (for 
further information refer to t he Investigator Brochure, trial 12166).
The BAY 63-2521 clearance was increased in smokers compared to non -smokers in 
a previous trial in patients with pulmonary  hypertension (IMP 12166; see IB for 
more information). Therefore, patients should report their smoking status to the 
investigator.
Due to the pharmacological mode of action of a guan ylate cyclase stimulator, 
treatment with BAY 63-2521 may unmask existing Pulmonary  Veno-Occlusive 
disease (PVOD), leading to pulmonary  congestion and subsequent pulmona ry 
edema. Given the severity  of the underl ying disease this effect may be life-
threatening. Clinical symptoms of uncovering of a PVOD may occur weeks to 
months after start of treatment with BAY 63-2521 . Should signs of pulmonary 
edema occur when BAY 63-2521is administered, the possibility  of associated 
PVOD should be considered and BAY 63-2521 should be discontinued 
immediately .
The following undesirable effects of the compound have been observed in clinical 
trials: decrease in blood pressure (in healthy  volunteers mainl y diastolic blood 
pressure), postural h ypotension, dizziness, sy ncope, increase in heart rate, nasal 
congestion, feeling hot, headache, d yspepsia, nausea, vomiting, gastritis, flushing, 
and hy perhidrosis (refer to the Investigator Brochure). Most of the undesirable 
effects are caused b y the vasodilators mode of action of the drug. The effects of the 
compound on smooth muscles may  lead to gastrointestinal sy mptoms (eg dilation of 
the esophageal sphincter with heartburn, esophagitis and dy sphag ia; diarrhea; 
constipation).
In addition, the possibility  of hitherto unforeseen side effects and allergic reactions 
to drugs, which can result in severe damage and even death, must alway s be 
considered.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 44of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Any new, relevant information about adverse drug reactions of BAY 63-2521 will 
be given to the patients (verball y and in writing).
Inadvertent overdosing with total daily  BAY 63 -2521 doses of 9 mg (13 and 
32days), 22.5 mg (14 and 15 day s), and 25 mg (2 day s) was reported for 5 subjects, 
which was tolerated without any  adverse events (for further information refer to the 
Investigator Brochure).
Overdosage following administration of BAY 63-2521 should be treated as 
clinically  indicated. There is no known antidote to BAY 63-2521.
Due to the pharmacological pr ofile of BAY 63-2521, cardiovascular effects as 
described in the Investigator Brochure ( Section 5.3.3.3) may be expected in case of 
overdose.
If symptoms develop after the investigational drug has been administered, any  
therap y that becomes necessary  has t o be guided by  the predominant sy mptoms. 
Patients have to remain under medical supervision until all relevant adverse effects 
have subsided. If adverse events occur, the investigator has to decide whether or not 
to remove the patient from the trial (refer to Section 4.3). Emergency  drugs and 
equipment has to be available to provide an y treatment, which may  become 
necessary.
In case of overdose, general measures to prevent absorption (eg, gastric lavage, 
activated charcoal) shoul d to be taken .
Note: To keep the investigators up-to-date regarding any kind of safety  relevant 
information the Development Core Safet y Information (DCSI), which is an 
appendix of the Investigators’ brochure, will be updated at regular intervals during 
theconduct of the trial. New versions of the investigator’s brochure will be made 
available to the investigators without delay .
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 45of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 87.2 Adverse Event Monitoring
Patient s must be carefully monitored for adverse events. Adverse events should be 
assessed in terms of their seriousness, severity , and relationship to the study 
drug.
7.3 Adverse Event Definitions
7.3.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation patient administered with a pharmaceutical product. The adverse event 
does not necessarily  have to have a causal relat ionship with this treatment.  An 
adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the 
use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product.
Adverse events associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related, include the following:
An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in 
professional practice.
An adverse event occurring from an overdose whether accidental or intentional.
An adverse event occurring from drug abuse.
An adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal. 
An adverse events where there is a reasonable possibility  that the event occurred 
purely as a result of the patient s participation in the study  (eg adverse event or 
serious adverse event due to discontinuation of anti-hypertensive drugs during 
Wash-Out Phase) must also be reported as an adverse event even if it is not 
related to the investi gational product.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 46of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharmacological action is not 
recorded as an adverse event if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the 
electronic CRF. If, however, the event fulfills any of the criteri a for a “serious” 
adverse event, it must be recorded and reported as such.
7.3.2 Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose: 
Results in death.
Is life -threatening.
Requires in -patient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization.
Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
Is an important medical event.
Life-threatening : The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refe rs to 
an adverse event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It 
does not refer to an adverse event which hypothetically  might have caused death if 
it were more severe.
Hospitalization : Any adverse event leading to hospitalizat ion or prolongation of 
hospitalization will be considered as Serious, UNLESS at least one of the following 
exceptions are met:
The admission results in a hospital stay  of less than 12 hours.
OR
The admission is pre-planned (ie elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to 
the start of the stud y). 
OR
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 47of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8The admission is not associated with an adverse event (eg, social hospitalization 
for purposes of respite care).
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospitalization may 
fulfil lthe criteria of ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as a 
serious adverse event dependent on clinical judgment . In addition where local 
regulatory  authorities specificall y require a more stringent definition, the local 
regulation takes precedent.
Any hospitalization required for carry ing out a routine right heart catheterization 
(RHC) procedure for conducting diagnostic invasive hemody namic measurements to 
evaluate a patient’s underly ing disease (without taking into account any clinical 
suspicion or finding with regard to the worsening of the underl ying disease) will not 
be considered as a serious adverse event. In this context, a RHC procedure is 
considered as a procedure and not as an adverse event (added with amendment 8) .
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal 
life’s functions.
Important medical event : Any  adverse event may be considered serious because it 
may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent another serious 
condition. As guidance for determination of important medical events refer to the 
“WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology  –Critical Terms List. These terms either 
refer to or might be indicative of a serious disease state. 
Such reported events warrant special attention becau se of their possible association 
with a serious disease state and may lead to more decisive action than reports on 
other terms.
7.3.3 Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected adverse event is any adverse drug event, the specificity  or severit y 
of which is not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure (refer to Section 
8.1. “Development Core Safety  Information” of the Investi gator Brochure ). Also, 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 48of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8reports which add significant information on specificit y or severit y of a known, 
alread y documented adverse event constitute unexpected adverse events. For 
example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the Investig ator 
Brochure would be considered “unexpected”. Specific examples would be; (a) acute 
renal failure as a labeled adverse event with a subsequent new report of interstitial 
nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis.
7.3.4 Relationship of Adverse Event to Investigational Product
The assessment of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of study  
drug is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the 
completion of the case r eport form.
An assessment of ‘No’ would include:
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation eg, mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.
OR
2. Non-Plausibility  eg, the patient is struck by an automobile when there is no 
indication that the drug cause d disorientation that may have caused the event; 
cancer developing a few day s after the first drug administration. 
An assessment of ‘Yes’ indicates that there is a reasonable suspicion that the 
adverse event is associated with the use of the investigation al drug.
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the adverse event to study 
drug include: 
The temporal sequence from drug administration: The event should occur after 
the drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be 
evaluated in the clinical context of the event.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 49of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Recovery  on discontinuation (de-challenge), recurrence on reintroduction (re-
challenge): Patient ’s response after drug discontinuation (de-challenge) or 
patient s response after drug re-introduction (re-challenge) should be considered 
in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.
Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each report should be evaluated 
in the context of the natural history  and course of the disease being treate d and 
any other disease the patient may have.
Concomitant medication or treatment: The other drugs the patient is taking or 
the treatment the patient receives should be examined to determine whether any 
of them may  be suspected to cause the event in questi on.
The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the test drug: The pharmacokinetic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the test 
drug(s), coupled with the individual patient ’s pharmacod ynamics should be 
considered.
7.3.5 Severity of th e Adverse Event
The following classification should be used:
The severit y of adverse events should be graded as follows:
Mild –usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal 
activities.
Moderate –sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal activities
Severe –prevents normal activities.
7.3.6 Adverse Event Documentation
All adverse events occurring in the period between the patient has signed the 
informed consent and until 30 days after definite stop of study  medication must be 
fully recorded in the patient’s case record form. However, in case that more than 30 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 50of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8days after stop of study  medication an adverse event occurred that has been 
considered as related b y the investigator, this needs to be documented too.
Documentation must be supported by  an entry  in the patient ’s file.  A laboratory  test 
abnormality  considered clinically  relevant, eg, causing the patient to withdraw from 
the study , requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged 
relevant by the investigator, should be reported as an adverse event.  Each event 
should be described in detail along with start and stop dates, severity , relationship to 
investigational product, action taken and outcome.
7.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events /Pregnancy
Serious adverse events (SAEs), including laboratory  test abnormalities fulfilling the 
definition of serious, that occurred in the period between the patient signed the 
informed consent and until 30 daysafter definite stop of study  medication must 
immediately  (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) be reported to the 
person detailed in the study  file. A serious adverse event form must also be 
completed within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness and forwarded to the 
designated perso n as detailed in the study  file. For reporting of serious adverse 
events an electronic adverse event form as provided in the electronic CRF shall be 
used. If the electronic CRF is not available due to technical problems (eg 
information cannot be entered into the electronic CRF ) serious adverse even ts need 
to be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness by using print out 
forms (e.g. via fax). Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution 
or stabilization by  submission of upd ated reports to the designated person.
If Global Pharmacovigilance requests supportive documents in context with a 
serious adverse event report (eg autops y report, hospital report) these documents 
shall be forwarded to the person detailed in the study  file(eg via fax).
The same rules apply to serious adverse events that occurred more than 30 days 
after definite stop of study  medication, if the investigator considers them as related 
to the study  medication.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 51of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events 
must be reported to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory  Authorities.
Pregnancy  occurring during a clinical investigation, although not considered a 
serious adverse event, must be reported to Bayer within the same timelines as a 
serious adverse event on a Pregnancy  Monitoring Form. The outcome of a 
pregnancy  should be followed up carefull y and any abnormal outcome of the 
mother or the child should be reported. This also applies to pregnancies following 
the administration of the investigational product to the father prior to sexual 
intercourse .
7.5 Reporting of Safety Related Events of Special Interest
For this trial the following safet y related event of special interest ha sbeen defined:
Syncope
Any syncope has to be reported as “i mportant medical event” (see section 7.3.2 ) and 
therefore as Serious Adverse Event (SAE) to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event.
8.USE OF  DATA AND PUBLICA TION
All data and results and all intellectual prope rty rights in the data and results derived 
from the study  will be the propert y of the sponsor, who may utilize the data in 
various ways, such as for submission to government regulatory  authorities or 
disclosure to other investigators. The investigator, whilst free to utilize data derived 
from the study  for scientific purposes, must discuss any publication with the 
sponsor prior to release and obtain written consent of the sponsor on the intended 
publication. The sponsor recognizes the right of the investiga tor to publish the 
results upon completion of the study .  However, the investigator must send a draft 
manuscript of the publication or abstract to the sponsor thirty  days in advance of 
submission in order to obtain approval prior to submission of the final version for 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 52of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8publication. This will be reviewed promptly  and approval will not be withheld 
unreasonabl y. In case of a difference of opinion between the sponsor and the 
investigator(s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a 
solution which satisfies both parties.

time need to be documented in the electronic CRF .
dDuring the Titration Phase t hese test have to be performed b y a second person (for WHO functional class assessment a second 
physician) who is not involved in the p rocess of study  drug titration and is unaware of the immediate reaction of the patient’s blood 
pressure and heart rate after dosing. This person will record the test results on a separate work sheet and a different person (could be 
the same person as invol ved in titration) will enter them into the electronic CRF
For consistency  reason, patients who were enrolled in trial 11348 before approval of protocol amendment 3 in their country  must use
the “Modified Borg Dy spnoea Scale” until the end of this study (for further details see section 4.6.4 ).

Sample collection, processing and storage
The blood samples will be collected in specific tubes which will be 
provided b y the central laboratory. Further details on collection, 
labeling, storage and shipping of samples are provided in a separate 
laboratory  manual.
At the latest at the end of the study  when all planned anal yses are 
completed, all PK samples will be destro yed.

possible no supplementary  oxygen should be given during the resting 
period and while blood samples are drawn. If the patient requires 
oxygen, car e should be taken that all samples are drawn with the same 
flow of ox ygen throughout the study whenever possible. Printouts from 
the analyzerhave to be stored in the patient file and the measured values 
have to be transferred into the electronic CRF.

10.4 6 Min Walking Distance (6MWD) Test
The 6MWD Test must be performed in accordance with the American 
Thoracic Societ y Guideline ( American Thoracic Society . ATS Statement: 
Guidelines for Six-Minute Walk Test. American Journal of Respiratory  
and Critical Care Medicine 2002; V ol 166. pp 111 -117)
According to the guideline, the 6MWD Test should be carried out 
indoors, along a long, flat, straight, enclosed corridor with hard surface 
that is seldom traveled. The walking course should be preferabl y30 m in 
length , but not less than 25 meters (longer walking courses should be 
shortened to 30 m).The length of the corridor and turnaround points 
should be marked.
Patients will be instructed to walk alone, not run, from one end to the 
other end of the walking course, at their own pace, while attempting to 
cover as much ground as possible in 6 min.
During the walk, patients are allowed to stop, lean against the wall and 
rest, but should resume walking as soon as they  feel able to do so.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 64of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8A “warm -up” period before the test should not be performed. The 
patients should sit at rest in a chair, locate d near the starting position, for 
at least 10 minutes before the test starts.
Investigators should not walk with the patients. Moreover, only 
standardized phrases for encouragement must be used during the test. To 
allow reproducibility , standardized phrase s should be used every minute 
according to the following pattern:
After the first minute, tell the patient the following (in even tones): 
“You are doing well. You have 5 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the 
followi ng: “Keep up the good work. You have 4 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the 
following: “You are doing well. You are halfway  done.”
When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the 
following: “Keep up the good work. You have only  2 minutes left.”
When the timer shows only 1 minute remaining, tell the patient: 
“You are doing well. You have onl y 1 minute to go.”
To reduce the variability of the 6MWD Tests, it is of utmost importance 
that the eligibility -test, the baseline -test and all following tests are 
performed under the same conditions (changed with amendment 8) :
Patients, who used walking aids alread y at the eligibility -test and the 
baseline -test (eg cane, walker), need to use the same walking aids at
every  subsequent 6MWD Test.
For quality  reasons, the inhalation of supplemental oxygen and the use 
of walking aids during the 6MWD Tests must be documented in the 
electronic CRF.
In case that a patient has never performed a 6MWD Test, a 
familiarization test should be performed during the Pre-Treatment Phase. 
To avoid any interactions, it is not permitted to perform the 
familiarization test on the same day  as the eligibility  6MWD Test.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 810.5 Borg CR 10 Scale®or Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale (if 
applicable)
In context with 11348 protocol amendment 3 the “Modified Borg 
Dyspnoea Scale” was replaced by the Borg CR 10 Scale®. For 
consistency  reason, patients who were enrolled before approval of 11348 
protocol amendment 3 in their country  must usethe “Modified Borg 
Dyspnoea Scale” throughout the main and the extension study .
The Borg CR 10 Scale or the Modified Borg Dy spnoea Scale (if 
applicable )will alway s be measured in conjunction with the 6MW D 
Test.
The Borg CR 10 Scale or the Modified Borg Dy spnoea Scale (if 
appli cable )will be explained to the patients before starting the 6M WD 
Test ( questionnaires and instructions will be provided in local language). 
Patients will be asked to rank their exertion at the end of the 6MWD 
Test. If a patient has problems to understand the principles of rating, an 
attempt should be made to explain the principles in a neutral and 
unpersuasive manner.
The test result will be entered on same work sheet as the 6MWD Test 
result .Later on the results will be transferred into the electronic CRF .
10.5.1 Borg CR 10 scale and test instructions
Use this rating scale to report how strong your perception of exertion is. 
First look at the verbal expressions. Start with them and then the 
numbers. Of these ten (10) or ”Extremel y strong”, “Maximal” is a very 
important intensity  level. This is the most intense perception or feeling 
you have ever had.
If your experience or feeling is “Very weak”, you should say “1”, if it is 
“Moderate”, say  “3”. Note that “Moderate” is “3” and thus weaker than 
“Medium”, “Mean” or “ Middle”. If the experience is “Strong” or 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 66of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8“Heav y” (it feels “Difficult”) say  “5”. Note that “Strong” is about half of 
“Maximal”. I s your feeling “Very  strong”, choose a number from 6 to 8. 
If your perception or feeling is stronger than ”10”, -“Extremely  strong”, 
“Maximal” –you can use a larger number, e.g. 12 or still higher (that’s 
why “Absolute maximum” is marked with a dot “ ●”).
It's very  important that you report what y ou actually  experience or feel, 
not what y ou think y ou should report. Be as spontan eous and honest as 
possible and try  to avoid under -or overestimating. L ook at the verbal 
descriptors and then choose a number. 
When rating your exertion give a number (in principle any  kind of 
decimal number is allowed) that corresponds to how hard and s trenuous 
you perceive the work to be. The perception of exertion is mainly  felt as 
strain and fatigue in your muscles and as breathlessness or an y aches.
0 ”Nothing at all”, means that y ou don’t feel any  exertion 
whatsoever, no muscle fatigue, no breathle ssness or difficulties 
breathing.
0.3
0.5 “Extremely  weak”, “Just noticeable”
0.7
1 “Ver y weak” means a very  light exertion. As taking a shorter walk 
at your own pace.
1.5
2 “Weak”, “Light”
2.5
3 “Moderate” is somewhat but not especially  hard. It feels good and 
not difficult to go on.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 85 “Strong -Heav y”. The work is hard and tiring, but continuing isn't 
terribly  difficult. The effort and exertion is about half as intense as 
“Maximal”.
6
7 “Ver y strong” is quite strenuous. You can still go on, but yo u really  
have to push yourself and you are very  tired.

9
10 “Extremely  strong –Maximal” is an extremely  strenuous level. For 
most people this is the most strenuous exertion they have ever 
experienced previously  in their lives.

● Is ”Absolute maximu m –Highest possible” for example ”12” or 
even more
10.5.2 Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale
Patients will be asked to rank their exertion. The rate of exertion will be 
given according to the following score ranging from 0 to 10:
0: nothing at all,
0.5: just noticeabl e, 
1: very  slight,
2: slight,
3: moderate, 
4: somewhat severe, 
5: severe,
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 68of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 86: between 5 and 7,
7: very  severe, 
8: between 7 and 9,
9: very  very  severe (almost maximal), 
10: maximal.
10.6 WHO functional class
The patient’s functional class will be determined by using the WHO 
classifi cation (Class I -IV / refer to American College of Chest 
Physicians. Diagnosis and Management of Pulmonary  Arterial 
Hypertension: ACCP Evidence -Based Clinical Practice Guidelines. 
Chest 2004; 126; 7 -10s):
I: Patients with PH but without resulting limitation of physical activit y. 
Ordinary  physical activity  does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, 
chest pain, or near s yncope.
II: Patients with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activit y. 
They  arecomfortable at rest. Ordinary  physical activity  causes undue 
dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near s yncope.
III: Patients with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity . 
They  are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity  causes undu e 
dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near s yncope.
IV: Patients with PH with inability  to carry  out any  physical activity  
without sy mptoms. These patients manifest signs of right -heart failure. 
Dyspnoea and/or fatigue may  even be present at rest. Discomfo rt is 
increased b y any physical activity .

EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health 
outcome. It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value 
for health status. The EQ -5D is a self -report questionnaire and nee ds to 
be completed b y the patient (questionnaires will be provided in local 
language). However, if the patient has problems completing the 
questionnaire, an attempt should be made to explain the questions in a 
neutral and unpersuasive manner.
After the patient has filled in the questionnaire, the questionnaire is 
transferred to the study  personnel, who will enter the content into the 
electronic CRF.

The L PHquestionnaire is designed to measure the effects of PHand PH 
specific treatments on an individual’s quality  of life.
The L PHis a self -report questionnaire and needs to be completed b y the 
patient (questionnaires will be pro vided in local language). However, if 
the patient has problems completing the questionnaire, an attempt should 
be made to explain the questions in a neutral and unpersuasive manner.
After the patient has filled in the questionnaire, the questionnaire is 
transferred to the stud y personnel, who will enter the content into the 
electronic CRF.
To measure the effects of sy mptoms, functional limitations, 
psychological distress on an individual’s quality  of life, the L PHasks 
patients to indicate using a 6 -point, zero to five, Likert scale how much 
each of 21 facets prevented them from living as they  desired.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 810.9 Role of the Steering Committee (SC)
The Steering Committee has the overall scientific responsibility  of the 
study . It will guide the trial in all aspects of safet y and efficacy  and has 
to assure that all relevant information coming from the sponsor (e.g. 
from the Global Pharmacovigilance department), from other study  
committees (e.g. from the Data Monitoring Committee) and from the 
investigators will thoro ughly be reviewed and all relevant decisions with 
regard to the conduct will be taken in due time. In particular the Steering 
committee has the following responsibilities:
 Primary  responsibility  for designing the stud y
 Primary  responsibility  for the conten t of protocol amendments
 To ensure a scientificall y sound and safe conduct of the study
 To decide on Data Monitoring Committee recommendations 
together with the sponsor
 Primary  responsibility  for the final study  report
10.10 Role of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
It is the main responsibility  of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
to protect the safety  of the patients participating in the BAY 63 -2521 
phase III program. In this context, the DMC will regularl y review 
accumulating study  data with the responsibi lity to provide an 
independent recommendation on the advisability  of continuing the study  
as planned.
The DMC will conduct its reviews based on unblinded data summaries. 
During the course of the trial the DMC and the SC should closely  
interact and alert ea ch other in order to assess all safet y relevant 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 75of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8information. The DMC should also closely  interact with the sponsor´s 
Global Pharmacovigilance department.
In case of unacceptable safet y profile, the DMCcan recommend to stop 
the trial. However, the final de cision will be made by  the SC together 
with the sponsor.
DMC will stop when all patients are on open label dose of Riociguat.

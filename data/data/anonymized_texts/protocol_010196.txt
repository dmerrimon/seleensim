2.1 Background and Rationale  
 
2.1.1 Impact of AMPS on the health of individuals and healthcare system:  
One in every four adolescent experiences chronic pain (1), which is defined as recurre nt or persistent pain for more 
than three months (2). Chronic musculoskeletal pain is prevalent in children and adolescents and increasingly being 
recognized as a public health concern (1,3,4).  
Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome (AMPS) is a p ain synd rome  with excessive musculoskeletal pain 
without a primary organic etiology. This includes Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), localized and diffuse 
amplified musculoskeletal pain syndromes, the latter also called as Juvenile Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JFS) . 
Prevalence of JFS in children is as high as 7.5% (5) with higher rates of depression (5, 6), lower quality of life (6) 
and greater school absenteeism, while parents suffer financial, social, and psychological consequences (1, 7).  
The cost of care for ado lescents with chronic pain without rheumatic diseases is almost three times as high as those 
with rheumatic diseases (7). The total costs to society for adolescents with chronic pain are estimated to be $19.5 
billion annually in the United States (8). Adol escents with chronic pain have a higher likelihood to transition into 
adults with chronic pain (9, 10), which is one of the costliest conditions in the modern western society (7) with the 
annual costs greater than heart disease and nearly 30 percent higher  than the combined cost of cancer and diabetes 
(11).  
Adolescents with AMPS have considerably higher level of disability than those with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(36, 37, 38 ). The monetary costs of AMPS are significant even before the diagnosis is made as there is a long 
diagnostic delay close to a year (36). Across tertiary care pain centers in the US, the mean annual cost of caring for 
a child with persistent pain is estimated to be $11,787 comparable to Attention Deficit Hyperactivit y Disorder (8). 
Many pediatric rheumatologists believe they are seeing increasing numbers of children with AMPS in the past two 
decades, although this may represent a recall bias (39). Further investigation into novel treatment regimens for 
pediatric AMPS is needed to replace or act as adjunctive options to relieve pain, improve function and reduce its 
overall socioeconomic burden.  
 
2.1.2 Critical gaps between AMPS treatment plan and implementation:  
 
A multimodal approach including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), aerobic and neuromuscular exercise with 
improving sleep hygiene and family functioning is the standard of care for AMPS patients (12). Most of these 
recommendations are founded on clinical  experience only, with the most robust efficacy data for CBT pain coping 
skills. Recent evidence suggests that CBT pain coping skills training has a significant, although modest and 
potentially only short -term effect, in reducing pain and disability for yo uth with chronic musculoskeletal pain (13).  
Furthermore, there are critical gaps between the treatment plan and implementation as these multicomponent 
treatment regimens are difficult to coordinate, often expensive, not fully reimbursed by insurance compa nies, and 
poorly accepted by many families. One study reported only 54% of families pursued any aspect of the recommended 
treatment plan and CBT interventions were pursued by less than 25% of the patients (14). Surprisingly 25% of 
adolescent AMPS patients receive an opioid and another quarter are treated with polypharmacy (15). AMPS patients 
become increasingly medicalized every year, resulting in unnecessary medical costs and an increased risk of 
iatrogenic injury (16). Poor availability of psychological a nd non -pharmacological services and treatments have 
been suggested as potential reasons for this unwarranted opioid exposure to the youth (15).  
2.1.3 Evolution of Virtual Reality as acceptable tool to treat acute pain in children:  
Virtual Reality (VR) is a state -of-the-art technology that consists of elements including a computer -generated virtual 
world, immersion, sensory feedback and interactivity (17). VR technology is a rapidly evolving field with an 
immense potential of use in medicine especially in p ain-medicine. Hoffman in 1996 was the first to report that VR 
could alleviate pain perception during painful burn care in adolescent patients (40). The past two decades have seen

Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 6 of 25  the evolution of VR to become an acceptable, safe and effective tool to provi de analgesia for acute painful 
procedures in children and adults alike. At present, there are 8 randomized controlled trials reporting the efficacy 
and safety of Immersive VR using a Head Mounted Device (HMD) in children and adolescents undergoing burn 
care, wound care, venipuncture and dental care (41 -48). In addition to patient -reported subjective pain outcomes, 
there is evidence from neuroimaging studies reporting VR distraction alone significantly reduced pain -related brain 
activity in the pain matrix ( insula, thalamus, and secondary somatosensory cortex) comparable to opioids for acute 
pain (49).  
2.1.4 Emerging evidence for use of VR for chronic pain in adults:  
The application of VR for chronic pain is fairly recent. The first application of VR for a c hronic painful condition 
was reported by Leibovici in 2009 for chronic pruritus (50) and the first mention of Virtual Reality as a potential 
intervention for fibromyalgia appeared in the scientific literature in 2010 by Ramchandran (25). Since then VR 
technology has been successfully applied for chronic neuropathic pain (19), phantom limb pain (20), CRPS (21, 
22), chronic neck pain (23, 24) and fibromyalgia patients (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34). Small sample sizes, 
non-immersive VR applications,  and lack of a control group limits most of these studies. There is one RCT 
(reference) reporting immersive VR as an intervention for chronic musculoskeletal pain.  The literature is wholly 
absent on the use of VR for diffuse amplified musculoskeletal pain in children or adolescents.  
Early acceptability and efficacy studies for Fibromyalgia patients emerged from Spain starting 2013 (28, 29). The 
first RCT evaluating efficacy of a projector -based VR intervention in adult fibromyalgia patients was published i n 
2015 which reported improved disability and quality of life in the intervention arm (30). The same year a proof of 
concept study reported that expos ing patients with fibromyalgia to visuals of exercises elicited neurophysiological 
changes in functional brain areas associated with pain catastrophizing (27). More recent studies in adult chronic 
pain patients report the use of immersive VR that uses a He ad Mounted Display showing promise for acceptability, 
safety and efficacy to reduce pain in the immediate period (31, 32, 33). However, they are limited by potential 
sources of bias and lack of a control group.  
2.1.5 Dearth of literature for the use of Vi rtual Reality for pediatric chronic pain:  
Our systematic review of literature of VR for chronic pain in pediatric patients found only two small studies (51, 
52), first in chronic headaches (n=10) and the other in Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (n=4). We did n’t find any 
published study on the use of VR for diffuse amplified musculoskeletal pain in children or adolescents.  
2.1.6 Distraction as a potential mechanism of action for acute pain relief:  
Our understanding of the potential mechanism of analgesia prod uced by VR is considered as key to its utilization 
for chronic pain (18, 53, 54, 55). The most well studied mechanism for acute pain management is active distraction. 
VR is thought to be more effective than traditional methods of distraction because of the  qualities of immersion and 
presence in engaging central attention resources. ‘ Immersion ’ is an objective term that describes the amount of 
sensory input the VR system creates. ‘Presence' is a subjective value of the illusion one experiences when using the  
system. While separate values, an increase in immersion often leads to an increase in presence felt by the user (17, 
56, 57). Strong evidence has also shown that the quality of VR, the amount of immersion, and interactivity directly 
correlates with the me asured quantity of analgesic effect (17, 40, 48, 58, 59). What remains unknown to date is 
whether VR -induced distraction is effective for pediatric AMPS patients even transiently.  
2.1.7 Impact of Virtual Reality at point of care for AMPS patients via distr action:  
AMPS can be a very painful condition and the mean pain score has been reported as high as 6.5 on a 0 -10 visual 
analog scale in this population (36). Patients experience periods of extreme discomfort and disability, which has 
psychological and econo mic consequences for both patients and parents. AMPS patients presenting to primary care 
and pediatric emergency department with extreme body pain and inability to walk often leads to hospitalizations. If 
VR is shown to be an effective analgesic modality l eading to immediate improvement in perceived pain in this 
population, its implications at the point of care could be far -reaching. In addition, it could be utilized as an adjunct 
to the often painful desensitization physical therapy. Repeated VR sessions i n which a person with persistent pain 
is exposed to a highly engaging virtual environment has been suggested to build confidence in one’s ability to use

Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 7 of 25  distraction for pain (54). It might also provide a novel option for AMPS patients who fail to respond t o conventional 
treatment such as CBT (54).   
2.1.8 Non -Distraction mechanisms for VR: Innovation and potential for improvement with research:  
Evidence  around  non-distraction  mechanisms  for application  of VR for chronic  pain is in its infancy.  The hope  is 
that it will produce  lasting  benefits  on pain control  even  when  the patient  is not actively  using  a VR device.  These  
hypothesized  mechanisms  include  self-control  over pain (35, 51), targeting  catastrophizing  via exposure  (26, 27), 
mirror  visual  feedback  (21, 25), and promoting  motivation  for movement  and positive  emotions  (28, 29, 30).  
 
Pain catastrophizing is a cognitive strategy broadly defined as “an exaggerated negative orientation towards actual 
or anticipated pain experiences that significantly contri butes to the maintenance of pain” (26). The ability to 
transition  from visuals representing feelings of pain in the virtual world to visuals representing feelings of calm, 
comfort and happiness has been shown to enhance self -efficacy in controlling pain and decrease pain catastrophism 
as compared to distraction only (35 ).  
It is worth noting that greater perceived coping efficacy and less catastrophizing to cope with pain is associated 
with better health outcomes in pediatric AMPS patients with lower levels of pain, functional disability, and 
psychological impairment (60 ). Pain catastrophizing has been suggested as a potential target in fibromyalgia 
patients by the use of VR exposure therapy similar to its use for phobias of spiders and flying (61, 62, 63). It is 
hypothesized that reducing catastrophizing will lead to red uced fear of movement and increased compliance with 
exercise therapy. Along these lines, Gromala et al. (65) and Arceneaux et al. (64) have used VR to help patients 
cope with pain that can occur during walking.  
In Conversion Disorder a person experiences blindness, paralysis, or other symptoms affecting the nervous system 
that cannot be explained solely by a physical illness or injury. Conversion symptoms can be seen in AMPS patients.  
VR technology has been shown to simulate movement of specific body part s that the patient is unable to control or 
avoids using (66). AMPS patients with conversion gaits and limb paralysis could potentially benefit from this VR 
functionality.  
Finally,  VR has been  reported  as a means  to promote  positive  emotions,  motivation  and education  (28, 29, 30). It 
is a strategy  not meant  to treat pain directly,  but instead  to overcome  one of the obstacles  that can hurt the treatment  
effectiveness  of patients  with chronic  pain syndromes.  It is known  that the optimal  outcomes  in AMPS  patie nts is 
often  contingent  in large  part on the degree  to which  patients  understand  and implement  appropriate  self-
management  strategies  (12).  VR has been  envisioned  as a “pain -coach”  standardizing  the presentation  of 
information  and education  around  pain processing  and behavior  in form  of providing  a common  application  using  
images,  instructions,  and sounds  (54).  Once  patients  have achieved  enhanced  pain control  via a combined  VR-
behavioral  intervention  protocol,  they may be more  motivated  and more  successful  with practicing  the behavioral  
intervention  on its own in their home  environment  (54).   
 
What remains unknown is whether immersive VR would reduce pain in adolescents with a chronic pain disorder 
like AMPS via one or a combination of these mechanisms.  Although studying the impact of VR delivered over 
multiple sessions and collecting cognitive pain measures in pediatric AMPS patients to demonstrate a lasting 
improvement should be the ultimate goal, the first step is to study the feasibility and acceptabilit y of VR in pediatric 
AMPS patients. Informed by the emerging evidence for potential mechanism of action of VR for chronic pain, we 
propose this pilot trial using a VR application that is immersive and would promote positive emotions in AMPS 
patients.  
2.1.9 Choice of VR Intervention for a pilot trial in AMPS subjects:  
It is important  to realize  that children  and adolescents  with AMPS  are characterized  by being  in chronic  disabling  
pain with a significant  impact  on their emotional,  physical  and social  wellne ss. The use of a novel  application  like 
VR warrants  a delicate  balance  between  sufficient  level  of immersion  without  any risk of creating  negative  emotions  
in this patient  population.  Gromala  has published  a series  of recommended  best-practices  laying  out a framework  
for adoption  of VR in clinical  practice,  creating  therapy  applications  or technology  (67).  Extrapolating  from  these  
PROTOCOL  TITLE:  A Pilot  Trial  of Audio -Visual  Relaxation  Techniques  for Pediatric  Amplifi ed Musculoskeletal  Pain 
Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 8 of 25  guidelines,  we did a search  of publicly  and commercially  available  VR applications  and found  most  of them  unfit  
for the pediatri c population  with AMPS.  Some  of the reasons  were  being  non-immersive  (projector -based  VR),  
posing  a risk of creating  negative  emotions  such as over stimulation,  nausea,  or a sense  of failure,  and finally  being  
hard to learn,  requiring  too much  setup  (hand,  head  trackers)  or complex  interactions  not likely  tolerated  by an 
adolescent  in pain.   
 
We found  Happy  Place  to be the only publicly  available  application  with an explicit  intent  to be used for chronic  
pain patients  (68).  It distracts  the user from  real world  and real body  by maximizing  presence  but has a low risk of 
inducing  negative  emotion.  In fact, it is intended  to promote  positive  effects  such as relaxation,  calmness  and feeling  
of awe and wonder.  It is easy to use and has a flat version  for screen  use.  
 
 
2.2 Risks to Subjects : 
Immersive VR has been found to be very safe in randomized controlled trials for acute pain in children. Usually, 
there are no side -effects. Potential side effects may include nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Attached with the 
protocol is a table summarizing  the adverse events in the eight RCTs studying immersive VR in the pediatric 
population published till date. In 6 out of the se 8 trials there were no side effects reported. In 2 studies, 5% and 16% 
of the subjects experienced mild nausea. Apart from nausea  there are no other side -effects reported from a brief use 
of immersive VR in the under 18 -year-old age group in the published literature.  
The safety manual of the device Oculus GO which we will use for this trial, mentions that 1 in 4000  children may 
have seizures, eye or muscle twitching or blackouts triggered by light flashes or patterns, even if they did not have 
a history of seizure -disorder. Thus, s ubjects with history of seizures, motion  sickness, severe headaches with 
contraindicat ion to the use of visual exposures to stimuli will be excluded.  
 
2.3 Potential Benefits to Subjects : 
 
There  is no direct  benefit  from  participation  in this study.  AMPS  subjects  participating  in this study  might  
experience  pain relief  for a variable  period  of time from  the use of immersive  VR. It might  enhance  their pain 
coping  skills,  improve  self-efficacy  to manage  pain and reduce  pain catastrophizing.   
 
If VR is shown  to reduce  chronic  pain in the immediate  period,  the implications  for the AMPS  population  could  be 
far-reach ing. It might  provide  transient  analgesia  for AMPS  patients  during  desensitization  physical  therapy  and 
also in the emergency  room  when  they present  with chronic  pain exacerbation.  The integration  of VR as a non-
pharmacological  intervention  in the manageme nt of AMPS  patients  could  help avoid  unnecessary  and potentially  
harmful  opioids  and provide  another  treatment  option  for non-responders  to standard  of care.  Finally,  if VR is shown  
to enhance  self-efficacy  in managing  pain,  AMPS  patients  can be more  succe ssful  in self managing  their pain in 
their home  environment.  
 
2.4 Alternatives  
 
Participation in this research study is  completely voluntary. If the subjects choose not to participate, they will 
continue to get standard of care treatment for AMPS. Non -participation in the study will not affect their management 
in any way.  
 
Standard of care for AMPS includes desensitization physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise 
and sleep hygiene.  
 
The VR device, Oculus GO and the application ‘Happy Place’ are available outside the research setting as well if 
the su bjects wish to continue using them  after participation in the study . Oculus GO costs $199 at the time of writing  
this protocol , and ‘Happy Place’ is a  free application.

Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 9 of 25  3 Objectives : 
 
The overarching research aim for this pilot trial is to collect feasibil ity data and other clinical estimates in 
preparation for a full scale adequately powered RCT to determine the effect of Virtual Reality on pediatric AMPS. 
As a pilot trial, the purpose is to evaluate the feasibility of trial processes, establish realistic milestones for 
completing trial enrollment, and estimate unknown parameters needed to design the large trial. We propose this 
pilot trial to address whether conducting a definitive RCT using Virtual Reality for pediatric AMPS is an appropriate 
trial design  and whether it is feasible with regard to 1) subject recruitment and data collection, 2) subject and parent 
acceptability of the intervention and control arms, 3) adherence to protocol. In addition, we wish to obtain estimates 
of the variance of the prima ry and secondary outcomes in the intervention and control arms required to design a 
definitive RCT.  
The primary objectives of this trial are as follows:  
1. To assess recruitment potential:  how many pediatric AMPS subjects were found eligible out of those screened 
within the trial period (eligibility rate) and out of these eligible subjects how many choose to participate in the 
trial (consent rate).  
2. To investigate the acceptability of interv ention (Virtual Reality) and control (iPad) to pediatric AMPS 
subjects and their parents  by using a mixed -method questionnaire (both quantitative and qualitative questions).  
3. To measure key outcome domains  for completion rates, missing data, estimates, vari ance (means, standard 
deviation and 95% confidence intervals for the differences between the intervention and control groups) for 
primary and secondary outcome measures for pediatric AMPS subjects (this data synthesis will inform the sample 
size of a defin itive trial).  
• The primary outcome of a definitive RCT will be subject pain intensity reported on the Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS) (73). The secondary outcomes include pain catastrophizing reported on Pain Catastrophizing 
Scale - Children (PCS -C) (71) and subject’s self -efficacy to manage pain reported on the Self -Efficacy 
Scale for Child Functioning (SES -C) (72).  
The secondary objectives of the trial are as follows:  
1. To assess eligibility criteria by determining whether the eligibility criteria for inclusio n in the trial are too open 
or too restrictive by estimating feasible eligibility (number of pediatric AMPS patients not eligible) and the 
reasons for ineligibility.  
2. To assess response of subjects  by estimating the completion rate of outcome measure quest ionnaires on day 2 
after the study visit in the intervention and control groups.  
3. To explore the trial design  by studying the logistics of blinding, randomization, adherence to protocol and data 
collection on REDCap.  
We hope that the results of this pilot trial will help address these areas of uncertainty before a future definitive RCT 
can take place. The decision to proceed with a future definitive trial is dependent on successful recruitment, 
randomization within the  planned time window, successful use of Virtual Reality and an adequate response rate 
from AMPS subjects. This proposal is informed by and based on the CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to 
randomized pilot and feasibility trials (reference). Thus , the prim ary focus of this pilot trial is not hypothesis -driven 
testing of efficacy or effectiveness but to assess feasibility of conducting a future definitive RCT.  
This proposal  is innovative  because  it explores  a new non-pharmacological  intervention  for AMPS.  It is significant  
because  the results  of a future  larger  RCT  based  on this pilot trial has the potential  to change  clinical  practice  for 
patients  with AMPS.  It is necessary  because  there  are no other  studies  studying  Virtual  Reality  to reduce  pain in 
pediat ric AMPS  population.

4 Enrollment and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
1. Age between 13 years and 17 years old (inclusive) at the time of consent.  
• Younger children's heads will likely be too small to use the VR headset (70) and 17 is the upper 
age limit for the definition of pediatric population.  
2. A primary diagnosis of AMPS including CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome), or localized or 
diffuse amplified pain syndrome  (as determined by the investigating pediatric rheumatologist).  
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1. An unde rlying  organic  cause  can explain  the pain including  inflammatory,  infectious,  traumatic  or 
malignant  etiologies.  
2. A history  of motion  sickness,  underlying  epilepsy,  severe  headaches  or other  conditions  where  the use 
of visual  exposures  to stimuli  is contrai ndicated.  
3. Inability  to report  a pain score  and/or  incapacity  to give assent  due to intellectual  deficit.  
4. Blind  subjects.  
5. Non-English -speaking  subjects  will be excluded  due to the unavailability  of the content  of the VR 
application  used in this study  in languages  other  than English.  
6. Any other  condition  that the investigators  think  can compromise  the integrity  of the study  or subject  
safety.  
 
 Study subject s may participate in another research study while participating in this research study.  
 
4.3 Withdrawal of  Subjects  
• If a subject develops severe nausea or vomiting or severe headache or dizziness, he or she will be 
withdrawn from the research without their consent.  
 
4.4 Recruitment and Retention  
4.4.1 Local Recruitment Methods  
 
4.4.1.1 Study Sites:  
The study will be carried out in the pediatric rheumatology clinic situated at the 4th Floor of Floating 
Hospital for Children and Tufts affiliated pediatric rheumatology satellite clinics in Woburn, Lawrence, 
Brockton and Chelmsford. The setting of these interventions will  be in a private clinic room at one of the 
sites.   
For the Tufts affiliated satellite clinics, the pediatric rheumatology clinic space  will be used for the purpose 
of this study. These institutions will not be engaged in research or data transfer.  
 
4.4.1. 2 Recruitment Sites:  
Subjects will be recruited from the pediatric AMPS population seeking care at Tufts Medical Center. 
Subjects will be identified through recruitment strategies employed at the pediatric rheumatology clinic in 
Boston and the Tufts affil iated pediatric rheumatology satellite clinics in Woburn, Lawrence, Brockton and 
Chelmsford.  
 
4.4.1.3 Recruitment Strategies:  
Subjects will be recruited during clinic interactions and through identification in the EMR by ICD searches.  
 
4.4.1.3.1 Clinic interactions:   
A screening sheet will be designed to assess eligibility as determined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
(see appendi x). This will be used by the investigators (TD, YZ, SJ) to identify eligible subjects during 
PROTOCOL  TITLE:  A Pilot  Trial  of Audio -Visual  Relaxation  Techniques  for Pediatric  Amplifi ed Musculoskeletal  Pain 
Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 11 of 25  routine clinic interactions. The investigators will use a study introduction sheet to explain the purpose of 
the trial briefly to potential subjects and their parents.  
 
Medical record numbers of eligible and interested subjects will be shared with one of the investigators (SJ)  
during the weekly departmental meetings (every Wednesday and alternate Fridays).  
 
This co -investigator (SJ) will then follow up with these eligible and interested subjects by telephone or 
email. A pre-defined script will be used for email and voicemail  (see appendix) . For over t he phone 
conversation, we will use the study introduction sheet (see appendix).  Attempts to contact potential subjects 
via email and telephone will be limited to a total of three attempts one week apart.  
 
4.4.1.3 .2 EMR ICD Search:   
We will utilize the CTSI's HER Chart Abstract Services to identify eligible subjects with the following 
ICD-10 codes (G89.0, G89.4, G90.50, G90.59, G90.511, G90.512, G90.513, G90.519, G90.521, G90.522, 
G90.523, G90.529). This search wou ld be limited to identifying potential subjects seen at Tufts or Tufts 
affiliated pediatric rheumatology clinic one year prior to trial commencement. All eligible subjects will be 
approached telephonically or via email if available and invited to participa te in the study. Once again, the 
study introduction sheet will be used to explain the purpose of this research.  
 
4.4.1.3.3 Screening Log:  
A screening log will be maintained tracking all the pediatric AMPS patients who are screened and those 
who were foun d eligible. For ineligible subjects, the reason for ineligibility will be reported. The screen 
failure data will only be retained u ntil the manuscript is written (~March 2020). This data will be used to 
assess the eligibility rate. In addition, this log will maintain a list of consented subjects.  
 
4.4.1.4 Scheduling the Study Visit:  
Subjects will be able to choose a date for the study visit in advance. For practical considerations, we will 
offer the sub jects and their families to choose a study visit day from three working days of a week (Tuesday, 
Thursday or Friday). The only exception will be eligible subjects presenting to Boston clinic on Thursday. 
If they agree to participate in the study the same d ay, they will be allowed to do that. One of the co -
investigators (SJ) will travel to the satellite clinics for consenting and study interventions if subjects are not 
able to travel to the study site in Boston.  
4.4.2 Study -Wide Recruitment Methods  
Is this a multi center study where subjects will be recruited by methods not under the control of the local 
Tufts site (e.g., call centers, national advertisements)?  
NO 
 
4.4.3 Payment  
Will subjects receive money, gifts, or any other incentive for participating in this  study?  
This does not include reimbursement for expenses, which is considered in the next section.                    
NO 
     
4.4.4 Reimbursement   
Will subjects be reimbursed for their expenses, such as travel, parking, meals, or any other study related 
costs?  
NO

 Page 12 of 25  5 Study Design  
5.1 Study Timelines  
 
The study  will run from  April  2018  (panning  phase)  to March  2020  (appendix)  with the data collection  to commence  
in ~January  2019  and be completed  by ~December  2019.  
 
5.2 Procedures  
 
The proposed  project  is a Randomized  Controlled  Pilot Trial  using  VR as an intervention  for perceived  pain in 
AMPS  patients  in the immediate  period.  There  are two arms  in this study.  The subjects  in the intervention  arm 
will be using  a brief  immersive  VR experience  “Happy  Place”  (68) delivered  via a stand -alone  head  mounted  
device,  Oculus  GO (69).  The control  subject  will watch  the same  content  without  the immersive  VR on an 
Apple  Tablet  (iPad)  for the same  duration.   
 
 
5.2.1 Study Procedure and Self -reported Forms:  
One co-investigator (SJ) will be responsible for study proced ures. Following informed consent, questions 
assessing baseline characteristics and  pre-intervention pain measures (VAS, PCS -C, SES -C) will be 
administered to each participant (please see appendix: Da ta Capture and Data Capture 2). After these baseline 
characteristics have been obtained, the participants will be randomized to the intervention (VR) and control 
(iPad) groups.  The participants in the intervention arm will receive an immersive VR experienc e “Happy Place” 
promoting positive emotions delivered via a stand -alone head mounted devise, Oculus GO for a total duration 
of 10 minutes. The participants in the control group will watch the same experience on an Apple Tablet for the 
same duration. The participant may only be accompanied by the parents. The participant in the VR arm will be 
given some time to get familiar with the equipment before starting the intervention. Pain measures (namely the 
VAS, PCS -C and SES -C) will then be administered after the relaxation session for each participant  (please see 
appendix, Data Capture 2) . In addition, the participants will get quantitative and qualitative questionnaires 
assessing  feasibility and acceptability (Data Capture 3).  Finally, p articipants would be asked to report VAS, 
PCS-C and SES -C measures two days after the study day in both groups via an email sent using REDCap  (Data 
Capture 2) .  
 
5.2.2 The Equipment:  
Oculus GO will be used as the VR equipment which is a stand -alone consum er-grade head -mount display 
(HMD). The HMD is placed on the head of the user, blocking off the surrounding environment. The visuals 
and audio are relayed through the HMD in a virtual space. An Apple iPad will be used for controls.  
 
5.2.3 The VR/iPad Conte nt: 
The content will be the application Happy Place created by agency Wenderfalck as a joint venture between 
Sweden's largest private pharmacy, Apotek Hjärtat and VR therapy startup Mimerse. It aims to distract subjects 
from their pain with a peaceful and interactive environment. The scene is a serene lakeside campground, and 
guided relaxation and soothing music is optional. Although MPAA rating for this content is not available it is 
estimated to be rated “G”. Happy Place is a publicly available applicatio n with an explicit intent to be used for 
chronic pain subjects. It distracts the user from real world and real body by maximizing presence but has a low 
risk of inducing negative emotion. In fact , it is intended to promote positive effects such as relaxation, calmness 
and feeling of awe and won -der. It is easy to use in the immersive VR environment and on the flat screen. 
Happy Place uses an innovative ‘gaze -based interaction’ with the virtual worl d. Around 50 “gaze objects” are 
placed around the scene and gazing at them would enable a timer following which an event is triggered. It is up 
to the user to figure out and explore through trial and error which objects trigger events.  
 
The control subjects will watch the same content for the same duration on an iPad screen. This experience will 
be different from the intervention subjects in two ways: 1) Lack of an immersive environment, 2) Lack of 
interactivity with the environment.

Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 13 of 25   
 
 
5.2.4 Duration of Content:  
The entire duration of the experience can be adjusted by running the application as a loop but will be kept at 10 
mins for the purpose of this study in both the groups. This is based on previous studies using HMD immersive 
VR fo r chronic pain subjects (32, 67) and also the mean duration of use of this application in the chronic pain 
popula tion reported by the developers . 
 
5.3 Evaluations  
Will you perform any laboratory tests for this study?  
NO 
  
5.4 Collection and Storage of Human Biological Specimens (Tissue Banking)  
Will biological specimens be stored for future, unspecified , research?   
NO  
  
 
6 Ethics and Protection of Human Subjects  
6.1 Informed Consent Process  
Will subjects be required to provide informed consent ? 
  
 
• After eligibility is determined, informed consent from the parents or legally authorized caregivers and 
assent from the child will be obtained (see appendix).  
• One co -investigator (SJ) will be responsible for consenting eligible subjects.  
• Consent and assent will be obtained in a private clinic room.  
• We will follow the SOP: Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP -090).  
• We will follow SOP: Written Documentatio n of Consent (HRP -091)  
• We will exclude Non -English -speaking subjects due to the lack of availability of the content of the 
intervention in languages others than English.  
 
 
6.2 Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process  
This applies for studies where informed consent will not be obtained, required information will not be 
disclosed, or the research involves deception . 
• Is a waiver or alteration of the consent process be ing requested for this study ?  
Yes. Waiver of consent is needed for the access of medical record for screening prior to signing the 
ICF. 
• Is a waiver of  the consent process be ing requested for parents  for research involving childre n?  
 
NO  
• Is a waiver of the consent process for planned emergency research  being requested ?  
No

6.4 Confidentiality  
 
The co -investigators will code all subject samples with a unique study id number. Only three co -
investigators (TD, YZ, SJ) screening patients in the clinics will access to this list saved as an Excel sheet 
and be able to link code number to subject name. T his Excel sheet will be stored on a TMC drive in a folder 
protected behind TMC Firewall and accessible only to these three co -investigators via a secure TMC login.  
  
Study data are to be collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (RE DCap) 
electronic data capture system. Participants will be entering their own data. This will be achieved using 
REDCap's functionality to send a clickable link to subject's email address, which will open up the 
questionnaires. On submission of the question naires, the data will be sent and securely saved in REDCap.  
 
For those who choose to answer the qualitative questionnaires on paper, one of the co -investigators (SJ) 
will subsequently enter the data into REDCap. HIPAA identifiers collected through REDCap w ill be limited 
to email address and date of birth.  
  
Consent / assent forms and paper qualitative questionnaires will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked 
office (pediatric rheumatology fellow’s office). Data will be exported from REDCap database int o 
statistical software for analysis. Additionally, REDCap has an audit trail that records every time changes 
are made to any data entered on the website.  
 
The signed and dated ICFs, child -assent forms and research data collected in this s tudy will be main tained 
for a minimum of 7 years after the study has been closed out in the IRB office . The screen failure data will 
only be maintained until the end of the study (~March, 2020).  
 
 
6.5 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
• Only one co -investigator will be responsible for obtaining informed consent, assent and carrying out 
the study procedures. This will limit the number of individuals obtaining private information.  
 
6.6 Provisions to Monitor the Study to Ensure the Safety of Su bjects  
Immersive virtual reality is very safe and typically does not result in any adverse events. The investigators 
will monitor the subjects for known side effects like nausea, headache and dizziness during the intervention. 
The intervention will be stop ped in the setting of severe nausea, vomiting, severe headache or dizziness.  
 
6.7 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
Does the research involve greater than minimal risk to subjects? (or if minimal risk, is there potential risk 
of research -related injury?):  
NO  
6.8 Economic Burden to Subjects  
Does the research involve any costs to subjects?  
NO

If the research involves individuals who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, describe the rationale 
for their inclusion and the additional safeguards included to protect their rights and welfare.  
Will pregnant women be enrolled?   
NO  
Will the research involve neonates of uncertain viability or non -viable neonates?  
NO  
 
 
Will subjects  who are not yet adults (neonates, children, teenagers) be enrolled?  
YES .  
 
We would use an informed -consent form for the parents or legal guardians.  
Eligible subjects contacted over the phone or email will have adequate time to between study introductio n 
and obtaining the assent.  
Subjects found eligible in clinic will be explained the study on the same day. If they are interested, they 
will have the option to participate the same day or return at a later date.  
Since it is a one -time intervention with a  brief follow up survey on day 2 after the procedures, we believe 
the assent obtained at the start of the study should suffice.  
Children enrolled as subjects will participate on the day of the intervention and then fill up a survey on 
day 2 after the part icipation.  
We will ensure to emphasize in an age appropriate language that the participation in the study is entirely 
optional and will in no way affect the medical care (please see assent attached).

8 Statistical Considerations  
8.1 Study Endpoints  
 
8.1.2 Description of study outcome for primary and secondary objectives:  
 
The overarching research aim of this pilot trial is to assess feasibility and determine estimates for a future 
definitive RCT. We will perform the following measurements to achieve our primary objectives:  
 
1. To assess recruitment potential, we will calcul ate the following:  
• Out of the screened patients, how many eligible subjects were found within the trial period (eligibility rate)  
• Out of the eligible subjects, how many choose to participate in the trial (consent rate)  
 
2. To investigate the acceptability of intervention (Virtual Reality) and control (iPad) to pediatric 
AMPS subjects and their parents  we will use a mixed -method questionnaire (including both quantitative 
and qualitative ques tions, see appendix) after the interventions.  
 
Quanti tative questionnaires  in REDCap will assess the following:  
• Prior use of VR, iPad and Happy Place,  
• Degree of immersion and fun experienced during the interventions  
• Side effects (dizziness, nausea, headache) experienced during the interventions  
 
Qual itative questionnaire  will also be REDCap based. Subjects and their parents will be given an option 
to write their responses on a paper -based questionnaire if they chose otherwise. Questions will be open 
ended assessing preferences of subjects about their VR or iPad experience, their suggestions for 
improvement, and willingness to try it in the future  in the clinic . The parent/caregiver questionnaire is 
limited to only two questions (see appendix, ‘Data Capture 3’) , firstly if they are willing to allow thei r child 
to try this technology in the future in the clinic and secondly, if they have any comments on the relaxation 
session.  
 
3. To measure key outcome domains for the definitive RCT,  we will calculate completion rates, missing 
data, rates, variance (means,  standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals for the differences between 
PROTOCOL  TITLE:  A Pilot  Trial  of Audio -Visual  Relaxation  Techniques  for Pediatric  Amplifi ed Musculoskeletal  Pain 
Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 17 of 25  the intervention and control groups) for primary and secondary outcome measures for pediatric AMPS 
subjects. This data synthesis will inform the sample size of the definitive tria l. 
 
• The primary outcome of a definitive RCT will be subject pain intensity reported on the Visual Analog Scale 
(VAS) (73). The secondary outcomes include pain catastrophizing reported on Pain Catastrophizing Scale - 
Children (PCS -C) (71) and subject’s se lf-efficacy to manage pain reported on the Self -Efficacy Scale for Child 
Functioning (SES -C) (72). These outcomes are described in detail in the next section.  
• These three self -reported outcomes are previously validated scales for pain in the adolescent p opulation. 
They will be administered before and after the intervention or control session for each participant. In addition, 
these outcome measure will be collected via online questionnaires on day 2 after the study visit in the 
intervention and control gr oups.  
 
To assess the secondary objectives, we will measure the following:  
 
1. To assess eligibility criteria,  we will determine whether the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the trial are 
too open or too restrictive by estimating feasible eligibility. To measure this, we will calculate the number 
of pediatric AMPS patients screened but not found eligible for the study, and the reasons for ineligibility.  
2. To assess response rate of subjects  we will estimate the completion rate of outcome measure (VAS, PCS -
C and SES -C) questionnaires on day 2 after the study visit in the intervention and control groups.  
3. To explore the trial design,  we will assess the logistics of blinding, randomization, adherence to protocol, 
potential sources of bias, and data collection on REDCap.  
 
8.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
We will report the results using the template for a CONSORT flow diagram for pilot trials. Th is would include 
numbers identified, approached, and recruited. For each group, losses and exclusions after randomization, and 
numbers analyzed, together with reasons (e.g., subjects’ unwillingness to use iPad) will be reported.  
 
A table showing baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of each group will be generated including 
active medications, psychological co -morbidities, and quality of life score.  
 
Quantitative Data:  
The quantitative questions assessing acceptability and feasibility will be  described using means and 
percentages. These would include recruitment rate (consisting of eligibility and consent rates), response rate for 
questionnaire completion at day 2 after the study, immersion and fun scores, and questions assessing side 
effects.  
 
Qualitative Data:  
The feasibility and acceptability outcomes will also be reported descriptively and narratively in the open -ended 
questionnaires. The data will be qualitatively analyzed by identification of emerging themes, and reporting 
subject and par ent’s quotes verbatim.  
 
Sub-group Analysis and Definitive Trial Sample Size Calculation:  
To measure key outcome domains for the definitive RCT, we will report descriptive statistics. This would 
include calculation of missing data, rates, means, standard d eviation and 95% confidence intervals for the 
differences between the intervention and control groups for primary and secondary outcome measures. There 
will also be a sub -group analysis for the same domains including only the strata with VAS of more than e qual 
to 4 out of 10. This data synthesis will be more representative of active AMPS and will inform the sample size 
of the definitive trial.  
 
8.3 Number of Subjects  
 
PROTOCOL  TITLE:  A Pilot  Trial  of Audio -Visual  Relaxation  Techniques  for Pediatric  Amplifi ed Musculoskeletal  Pain 
Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 18 of 25  Since this is a pilot trial, a formal sample size calculation is not performed. We aim to rec ruit up to 40 
participants in order to have  a total of 30 subjects to complete the study ( 15 subjects in each arm ). This is based 
on the estimate of how many subjects the authors can practically enroll within the timeframe of this trial. Cocks 
(79) have re ported a table of recommendations for sample size calculations for pilot trials with a range of 20 
(10 subjects per arm) to 55 subjects in total. Our sample size of 30 is within this range.  
 
8.4 Data Management  
 
• Study data are to be collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) 
electronic data capture system. Participants will be entering their own data. This will be achieved using 
REDCap's functionality to send a clickable link to subj ect's email address  which  will open up the 
questionnaire (see appendix, ‘Script for follow -up survey email’). On submission of the questionnaires, 
the data will be sent and securely saved in REDCap.  
• For those who choose to answer the qualitative questionna ires on paper, one of the co -investigators (SJ) 
will subsequently enter the data into REDCap. HIPAA identifiers collected through REDCap will be 
limited to e mail address and date of birth. Data will be exported from REDCap database into statistical 
softwar e R Studio for analysis.  
• Consent / assent forms and paper qualitative questionnaires will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked 
office (pediatric rheumatology fellow’s office). Data will be exported from REDCap database into 
statistical software for a nalysis. Additionally, REDCap has an audit trail that records every time 
changes are made to any data entered on the website.  
 
 
8.5 Randomization  
Will subjects be randomized?  
YES  
 
Randomization and Allocation Concealment:  
We propose a parallel -group randomized controlled pilot -trial with a stratified randomization and 
an equal allocation ratio of 1:1. After a child -assent and a parent or legal guardian consent has been 
obtained, the subjects will be randomly allocated into Group A (VR group/intervention group) or 
Group B (iPad group/control group) using a computer -generated random number sequence 
constructed by a biostatistician. This allocation will be deployed using standard opaque envelopes 
containing a pre -generated allo cation sequence which is unveiled to the investigator just prior to 
the intervention. The investigator performing the interventions will not have access to allocation 
codes.  
The randomization will be stratified on the basis of pain score on the day of int ervention. Subjects 
with a pain score of 4 or higher on the 0 -10 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on the day of participation 
will belong to a stratum and will be subjected to a separate randomization scheme than those who 
have a score of less than 4. This is bas ed on the mean pain score of 6.5 reported in pediatric AMPS 
population (1, 36) with the IQR (difference between 75th and 25th percentile) of 4 and 8.5 on a 
Visual Analog Scale of 0 -10. This is to ensure that outcome domains representative of active AMPS 
are captured to inform the sample size of a future trial at the same time maximizing the benefit of 
this pilot trial to all interested AMPS subjects.  
 
Blinding:  
• In this pilot trial blinding of the subjects completely is not possible as subjects will know the 
intervention they receive. In order to minimize the subject bias, we will introduce the study as 
PROTOCOL  TITLE:  A Pilot  Trial  of Audio -Visual  Relaxation  Techniques  for Pediatric  Amplifi ed Musculoskeletal  Pain 
Syndrome  
VERSION DATE:  11.15.2018  
 
 Page 19 of 25  comparison of two audio -visual relaxation techniques, without  using the terms “Virtual Reality” 
or “iPad”. The subjects would not know the modality of use in the other group.  
• It is not possible to blind the test administrator either as one of the co -investigators (SJ) will 
perform the trial interventions. We plan t o minimize this bias by having the subjects directly 
entering the outcomes as digital data in REDCap proof to tempering by the investigators. Only 
the qualitative questionnaires assessing acceptability and feasibility will be paper -based, if 
subjects choos e that option.  
• Finally, the data analyzer (SJ) will be the same co -investigator performing the intervention and 
thus not blinded to the groups.  
  
 
9 Drugs or Devices  
Will the research involve drugs ?   
NO 
Will the research involve devices?   
YES  
 
10 Study Administration  
10.1 Setting  
 
The study will be carried out in the pediatric rheumatology clinic situated at the 4th Floor of Floating 
Hospital for Children and Tufts affiliated pediatric rheumatology satellite clinics in Woburn, Lawrence, 
Brockton and Chelmsford. The setting of these interventions will be in a private clinic room at one of the 
sites.  
 
10.2 Registrati on 
 
A screening sheet will be designed to assess eligibility as determined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
(see appendix). This will be used by the co -investigators (TD, YZ, SJ) to identify eligible subjects during 
routine clinic interactions. The co-investigators will use a study introduction sheet to explain the purpose 
of the trial briefly to potential subjects and their parents. The same introduction sheet will be used as a script 
to introduce the study over the phone for subjects identified thr ough ICD -10 searches.  
 
A screening log (see appendix) will be maintained tracking all the pediatric AMPS patients who are 
screened and those who were found eligible. For ineligible subjects, the reason for ineligibility will be 
reported. In addition, this log will maintain a lis t of consented subjects.  
 
10.3 Resources Available  
 Trevor Davis, Yujuan Zhang and Saumya Joshi will be responsible for screening patients presenting to 
pediatric rheumatology clinics.  
 Saumya Joshi will be responsible for screening and contacting patients thro ugh ICD -10 searches . 
 Saumya Joshi will be responsible for obtaining informed consent, assent and performing the study 
procedures . He has adequate training and expertise for consenting participants.

 Page 20 of 25  
 At the pediatric rheumatology clinic at TMC, Boston, we see two new AMPS patients every week on 
average in addition to follow up visits from AMPS patients. W e believe recruiting 30 AMPS patients 
in one -year period should be feasible.  
 We have purchased the  VR device for the purpose of the study.  
 We have a secure departmental iPad which we plan to use for controls and collection of data on 
RECDap.  
 The pediatric rheumatology departmental weekly meetings (every Wednesday and alternate Fridays ) 
will be used to  ensure adequate o versight of the informed consent and assent process, adherence to the 
study protocol and procedures in addition to reminding all members of the research team about their 
roles and responsibilities and discussing any emerging side effects.  
 
10.4 IRB Review  
• Tufts IRB registered with the OHRP  will review and approve this study.   
• Any amendments to the protocol or informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by the 
IRB prior to use, unless required to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects.

Protocol Title:   A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT -494) Once 
Daily Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) Monotherapy in MTX -Naïve Subjects w ith Moderately to 
Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis
Objectives:   
Period 1
1.To compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg once daily (QD) monotherapy (for 
subjects in Japan only), 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 30 mg QD monotherapy versus weekly 
methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy for the treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthr itis 
(RA) in MTX- naïve subjects with moderately to severely active RA.
2.To compare the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy and upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
monotherapy versus weekly MTX monotherapy for prevention of structural progression in 
MTX -naive subjects with moderately to severely active RA.
Period 2
To evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD (for subjects in 
Japan only), 15 mg QD, and 30 mg QD in subjects w ith RA who have completed Period 1.
Investig ators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 330
Study Population:   Adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a duration of 
symptoms consistent with RA for ≥ 6 w eeks who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/European League Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA and no prior or limited MTX treatment.  Eligible 
study subjects must have ≥6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 
68joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and hig h-sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP) 
≥ 5mg/L (central lab, upper limit of normal [ULN] 2.87 mg/L) at Screening.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 975 subjects
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes tw o periods and a Japan sub -study.  Period 1 is a 
48-week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, active comparator controlled treatment period 
designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD monotherapy (for subjects in 
Japan only), 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 30 mg QD monotherapy versus MTX monotherapy in adult 
MTX -naïve subjects with moderately to severely active RA.  Period 1 is also designed to compare the 
efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy and 30 mg QD monotherapy versus M TX m onotherapy 
for the prevention of structural progression.  Period 2 is a long -term extension to evaluate the long -term 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib (7.5, 15, or 30 mg QD) in subjects w ith RA who have 
completed Period 1.

Methodolog y (Continued):
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will receive open -label 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Subjects receiving MTX will receive open -label MTX.
The study duration will include a 35 -day screening period, a 48 -week randomized, double -blind, 
parallel -group, active- comparator controlled treatment period (Period 1); a 212-week extension period 
(blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1) (Period 2); and a 30 -day follow -up (call 
or site vis it).
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment Groups 2, 3 and 4 below , except for subjects 
from Japan, who will be randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4: 
Group 1:  Upadacitinib 7.5mg QD monotherapy ( subjects in Japan only ; N = 7 5)
Group 2:  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy (N = 300) (includes 37 subjects from Japan)
Group 3:  Upadacitinib 30 mg QD monotherapy (N = 300) (includes 37 subjects from Japan)
Group 4:  MTX monotherapy (N = 300)(includes 37 subjects from Japan)
Each subject will be instructed to take 2 capsules once weekly (MTX and/or matching placebo) and 
1tablet once daily (upadacitinib or matching placebo) to maintain blinding.  MTX and matching placebo 
will be assigned via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system, and distributed as identical 
capsules in blister packs, to provide the correct total dose for each individual subject and to maintain 
blinding during and after MTX titration (Period 1 and Period 2).  Detailed dosing instructions can be 
found in the Subject Dosing Diary and Instructions.   Starting w ith Amendment 6 subjects receiving MTX 
will receive open -label MTX tablets in quantities sufficient to cover their respective dose.
Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD, or 30 mg QD will start on their 
respective upadacitinib dose at Baseline.  Subjects who are assigned to the MTX treatment group will 
start oral MTX treatment at 10 mg/week and will be titrated up to 20 mg/week (increase by 5 mg every 
4weeks), as tolerated, b y Week 8 (minimum 15 mg/week final dose required, w ith documentation of 
intolerance of > 15 mg/week).  (For subjects in Japan:  start at 7.5 mg/week with titration up to 
10mg/week at Week 4 and to 15 mg/week, as tolerated, by Week 8; minimum of 7.5 mg/wee k for final 
dose is required, w ith documentation of intolerance of > 7.5 mg/week).  After completion of MTX (or 
placebo) titration, a single dose reduction of study drug (by 5 mg of MTX) is allow ed for safety reasons, 
up to Week 26, as long as the subject remains on ≥ 15 mg/week of MTX (or matching placebo) w eekly 
(for subjects in Japan:  ≥7.5mg/week).  In addition, all subjects should take a dietary supplement of oral 
folic acid (or equivalent) throughout study participation.  Folic acid dosing and timin g of regimen should 
be follow ed according to Investigator 's discretion.  Rescue therapy has been defined for Weeks 12 
through 24, Week 26, and Weeks 36 through 40.  Starting at the Week 48 Visit (after Week 48 
assessments have been performed) and thereafter, initiation of or change in background RA 
medication(s), including corticosteroids, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
acetaminophen/paracetamol, and csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the 
combination of MTX and leflunomide ) is allowed as per local label.
Rescue therapy for those subjects who meet the following criteria from Week 12 through Week 24 are as 
follows:
Those w ho do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared w ith baseline at 
two consecutive visits starting at Week 12 w ill continue on their blinded therapy and the 
Investigator should optimize (initiate or increase) background RA medications:  NSAIDs, 
corticosteroids (oral ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent or prednisone equivalent 
≤0.5mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days) and/or low -potency analgesics.

Methodology (Continued):
Rescue therapy for those subjects who meet the following criteria at Week 26 are as follows:
1.Subjects who were originally randomized to MTX:
Those w ho do not achieve CR by CDAI :
obut achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared with baseline will continue 
on blinded MTX and the Investigator should optimize (initiate or increase) background RA 
medications:  NSAIDs, corticosteroids (oral ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent and up to 
2local injections), low -potency analgesics and csDMARDs (only 1 of the following:  
sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine) throughout the remainder of Period 1 and 
until the study is unblinded.
oand do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in b oth TJC and SJC compared w ith baseline will 
be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive blinded upadacitinib 15 mg QD or upadacitinib 
30mg QD (for subjects in Japan:  randomize 1:1:1 to receive upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 
15mg QD, or 30 mg QD) while continuin g MTX treatment in a blinded manner and w ill 
remain on upadacitinib plus MTX throughout the remainder of Period 1 and until the study 
is unblinded.
Those w ho achieve Clinical Remission (CR) by clinical disease activity index (CDAI) (CDAI 
≤2.8) at Week 26 will continue blinded treatment with MTX throughout the remainder of 
Period 1 and until the study is unblinded (the study is unblinded when all subjects have 
completed Period 1).
2.Subjects who were originally randomized to upadacitinib:
Those w ho do not achieve CR by CDAI: 
obut achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared with baseline will continue 
on blinded upadacitinib and the Investigator should optimize (initiate or increase the dose) 
background RA medications:  NSAIDs, corticosteroids (or al ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone 
equivalent and up to 2 local injections), low -potency analgesics and csDMARDs (only 1 of 
the following:  sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine) throughout the remainder 
of Period 1 and until the study is unblinded.
oand do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared w ith baseline will 
add MTX 10 mg/week (7.5 mg for Japan) to upadacitinib in a blinded manner and will 
remain on upadacitinib plus MTX 10 mg/week (7.5 mg for Japan) throughout the remainder 
of Pe riod1 and until the study is unblinded.
Those w ho achieve Clinical Remission (CR) by CDAI (CDAI ≤ 2.8) at Week 26 w ill continue 
blinded treatment with upadacitinib throughout the remainder of Period 1 and until the study is 
unblinded (the study is unblind ed when all subjects have completed Period 1).

Methodology (Continued):
Rescue therapy for those subjects who meet the following criteria from Week 36 through Week 40 are as 
follows:
Starting at Week 36, those who do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC 
compared with baseline at tw o consecutive visits will continue on their blinded therapy and the 
Investigator should optimize (initiate or increase) background RA medications:  NSAIDs, 
corticosteroids (oral ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent or prednisone equivalent 
≤0.5mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days, and up to 2 local injections), low -potency analgesics 
and csDMARDs (only 1 of the following:  sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine)
An unblinded analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Week 24 for the purpose of 
regulatory submission.  To maintain integrity of the trial and avoid introduction of bias, study sites and 
subjects will remain blinded for the duration of Period 1.  Additional unblinded analyses may be 
conducted after the Week 24 analysis.
Each subject will undergo a maximum of 3 scheduled visits for x -ray examination of bilateral hands and 
feet during Period 1 (unless unscheduled repeat imaging is needed due to failure to meet the quality 
requirements) at Screening, Week 24, and Week 48/Premature Discontinuation.  One additional x -ray 
examination of bilateral hands and feet may be needed depending on the time of premature study drug 
discontinuation for those subjects that continue the study.
Subjects who complete the Week 48 Visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long -term extension, Period 2 
(212weeks).  Subjects will continue study treatment per assignment at the end of Period 1 in a blinded 
fashion.  When the last subject completes the last visit of Pe riod 1 (Week 48), study drug assignment in 
both periods may be unblinded to the Sponsor and sites, and subjects w ould then be dispensed study drug 
in an open -label fashion until the completion of Period 2.  All subjects will continue study treatment to 
which they were assigned at the time of study unblinding.  Dose changes of open -label study drugs are 
not permitted during unblinded Period 2.  Background therapies may be adjusted as per the discretion of 
the investigator (refer to Section 5.2.3.1 for additi onal details on permitted background therapy in 
Period 2).
Each subject will undergo a maximum of 3 scheduled visits for x -ray examination of bilateral hands and 
feet during Period 2 (unless unscheduled repeat imaging is needed due to failure to meet the quality 
requirements) at Week 96, Week 192, and Week 2 60.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue from 
Period 2 will undergo an x -ray of hands and feet unless the previous x -ray was performed within the 
previous 24 w eeks.
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will receive open -label 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD.  Subjects receiving MTX will receive open -label MTX.
Study visits may be impacted by state of emergency or pandemic like COVID -19.If visits cannot be 
conducted onsit e due to travel restrictions or other pandemic or state of emergency related reasons, 
virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit frequency and timing of study 
procedures, among others may be performed. Every effort should be made to ensure the safety of 
subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study.

Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the Full Analysis Set population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
Period 1 Efficacy
Analysis of the Prim ary and Key Secondary Endpoints:
For the global analysis, comparisons of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be mad e 
betw een the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups versus the MTX group for all subjects 
(excluding the Japan specific upadacitinib 7.5 mg treatment arm).  The overall type I error rate of the 
primary and key secondary endpoints for the two doses will be strongly controlled.
For the Japan sub -study, comparisons of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be made 
betw een the upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups versus the MTX group for 
subjects enrolled in Japan only.  
For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group.  Pairw ise 
comparisons between each upadacitinib group and the MTX group w ill be conducted using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification fact ors.  
For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported for each 
treatment group.  Pairw ise comparisons betw een each of the upadacitinib treatment groups and the MTX 
group will be carried out using the analysis of covariance model w ith treatment group as the fixed factor, 
and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates.
For mTSS -based endpoints, both linear extrapolation and as observed analysis will be conducted.  For 
other endpoints, non -responder imputation approach w ill serve as the primary analysis approach for key 
binary endpoints and multiple imputations will serve as the primary analysis approach for key continuous 
endpoints.  Sensitivity analyses based on observ ed cases will also be conducted for key endpoints.
Long -Term Efficacy for Period 1 and Period 2 Combined:
Long -term efficacy by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
Pharm acokinetic:
A non-linear mixed -effects modeling approach w ill be used to estimate the population central values and 
the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual values of upadacitinib oral clearance (CL/F) and 
volume of distribution (V/F).  Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of 
the data.
Safety:
Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set, which includes all subjects who receive 
at least one dose of study drug.  Analyses will be conducted for Period 1 alone, as w ell as for Period 1 
and Period 2 combined.   Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, 
ECG, and vital signs.  Frequency tables and lists of subjects w ith treatment -emergent AEs by preferred 
term as in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary, b y system organ class, by 
severity, and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the Investigator w ill be provided.  The 
changes from baseline in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory values will be 
analyzed in a descriptive manner.  Shift of laboratory values from baseline to defined time points will be 
tabulated.

3.0 Introduction
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disease of unknown 
etiology .  The hallmark feature of RA is an inflammatory  process manifested by  persistent 
symmetric pol yarthritis of sy novial joints which can ultimately  lead to bone erosions, 
deformity , and disability .  Left untreated, or inadequately  treated, progressive functional 
impairment with increasing disability  occurs leading to a reduction in quality  of life.  The 
prevalence of RA in the general population is approximately  1%, and increases with age 
in both genders, with women bei ng more prone to developing RA than men.  Earl y 
therap y with disease -modify ing anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the standard of care, 
including conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) (e.g., methotrexate [MTX], 
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine, and leflu nomide), and biologic DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) (e.g., anti -tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and non- anti-TNF biologics).
The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends a Treat -to-Target 
(T2T) approach to initiate therap y immediatel y after diagnosis of RA wit h a goal of 
achieving clinical remission (CR) or low disease activity  (LDA), as these are associated 
with improved long -term outcomes.1-3  Also, in line with recent advances in earl y 
diagnosis, new classi fication criteria have been developed.  The 2010 American College 
of Rheumatology  (ACR)/EULAR classification criteria redefined the paradigm of RA b y 
focusing on features at earlier stages of disease that are associated with persistent and/or 
erosive disea se, rather than defining the disease by  its late -stage features.4
Despite major progress in the treatm ent of RA, there still remains a large unmet medical 
need, as onl y a small percentage of RA patients reach or maintain a status of LDA or CR 
over time or need to discontinue due to safet y or tolerability issues.5,6  Novel therapies are 
therefore needed to complement the available interventions to address the unmet need.5-7

JAK Inhibitor
Evidence suggests that inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) -mediated pathway s is a 
promising approach for the treatment of patients with this chronic disease.8  AbbVie is
developing a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib (ABT -494), that may  address 
the current needs.
The JAK family  is composed of 4 famil y members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine kinase 2 
(Tyk2).  These cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases are associated with me mbrane cy tokine 
receptors such as common gamma -chain receptors and the gly coprotein 130 
transmembrane proteins.9  Activation of JAK pathway s initiates expression of survival 
factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocy te cellular 
trafficking and cell proliferation which contribute to inflammatory  and autoimmune 
disorders.
Hence, the JAK family  has evoked considerable interest in the area of inflammatory 
diseases leading to the development of various JAK inhibitors with different selectivity 
profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Ty k2 which have demonstrated efficacy  in 
indivi duals with RA.10-14  Tofacitinib, the first in this class, has been approved in the 
United States and in other countries for treating moderately  to severely  active RA patients.  
Although tofacitinib, a non-selective JAK inhibitor, improves the clinical signs and 
symptoms, and inhibits structural progression in RA patients, questions regarding the 
safet y profile remain, including serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, 
malignancies, and hematologi c adverse events (AEs).
The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different selectivity  profiles against JAK1, 
JAK2, JAK3, and Ty k2, are in development.8  Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 
inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severel y 
active RA.  In an in vitro setting, upadacitinib potently inhibits JAK 1 activity, but to a 
lesser degree, inhibits the other isoforms, JAK2 and JAK3.  The enhanced selectivity of 
upadacitinib against JAK1 may  offer an improved benefit -risk profile in patients with RA.  
The clinical h ypothesis is that upadacitinib should be e ffective in decreasing joint

inflammation and damage associated with RA by  interfering with JAK1 -mediated 
signaling pathway s (i.e., interleukin -6) without causing excessive anemia due to its 
reduced activity  against JAK2 (IC 50120 nM), which is essential f or ery thropoietin 
signaling.  Upadacitinib is also less potent against JAK3 (I C502.3 µM), an important 
component of ly mphocy te activation and function.  As such, treatment with upadacitinib, 
a selective JAK1 inhibitor with reduced JAK3 inhibition, could r esult in a decreased risk 
for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy compared to a pan JAK 
inhibitor or less selective JAK inhibitors.
Phase 2 Studies with Upadacitinib
The Phase 2 program for upadacitinib consisted of 2 randomized cont rolled trials (RCTs), 
both on stable background MTX therap y, in subjects with moderatel y to severel y active 
RA and one open -label extension (OL E) stud y (Study M13 -538; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for those 
subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs.  Study  M13 -550([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response to anti -TNF therap y and 
Study M13 -537 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolled subjects who had shown an inadequate 
response to MTX.  A total of 4 twice dail y (BID) and 1 once dail y (QD) dose regimens of 
upadac itinib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 18 mg BID, 
and 24 mg QD) were evaluated.
In TNF -inadequate responder (TNF -IR) subjects, who represent the population with the 
greatest unmet need, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was 
significantl y greater at all doses of upadacitinib (up to 73%) compared with placebo 
(35%).  In addition, numericall y higher proportions of subjects achieved ACR50 and 
ACR70 responses and LDA (based on Disease Activity  Score [DAS]28 C -React ive 
Protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI ]) in the upadacitinib dose 
groups versus placebo.
In MTX -inadequate responder (MTX -IR) subjects, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 
response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
31
of upadacitinib compared with placebo (50%).  At all doses of upadacitinib compared to 
placebo, significantl y higher proportions of subjects achieved LDA and CR at Week 12.
Safety  data from these two studies (N = 575) showed that the t ypes and frequencies of 
AEs during upadacitinib treatment were consistent with subjects with moderatel y to 
severel y active RA receiving immunomodulatory  therapy .  The incidences of AEs were 
numericall y higher in the upadacitinib dose groups, with a trend t oward higher rates with 
higher doses of upadacitinib.  The most frequentl y reported AEs ( ≥ 5%) in the 
upadacitinib treated subjects were urinary  tract infection, headache, upper respiratory  tract 
infection, and nausea.  There were 6 subjects (1.3% of total combined populations) with 
herpes zoster reactivation distributed across the upadacitinib dose groups, and 2 subjects 
(1.9%) in the placebo groups.  I n these two 12 week studies, a total of 2 subjects in the 
upadacitinib treatment groups reported malignan cies.  One subject reported non -
melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) and 1 subject 
was diagnosed with lung cancer after the final scheduled visit, and subsequently died 
14weeks after stud y completion.  These events were re ported by  the Investigators as not 
possibly  related to study  drug.  Elevations of liver function tests were sporadic with no 
clear dose -response relationship observed.  As observed with other JAK inhibitors, 
treatment with upadacitinib resulted in an incre ase in lipids (low -density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol [L DL-C] and high- densit y lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL -C]).  Among subjects 
with laboratory  evidence of sy stemic inflammation (as evidenced b y high -sensitivity  
C-reactive protein [hsCRP] > upper limit of normal [UL N]), treatment with lower doses 
of upadacitinib (3 mg BID and 6 mg BID) was associated with improvements in mean 
hemoglobin relative to placebo.  At higher doses, there was a reduction in mean 
hemoglobin; however, the mean hemoglobin levels remaine d within normal range 
throughout the treatment period.
3.1 Differences Statement
Study  M13 -545 differs from other upadacitinib studies as it is the first study to evaluate 
the safet y and efficacy (clinical and structural) of upadacitinib in subjects diagnosed with 
active RA who are naïve to MTX therap y.

3.2 Benefits and Risks
Despite the availabilit y of various RA therapies, including csDMARDs and bDMARDs, 
many  patients still do not respond adequatel y to these treatments, or gradually lose 
response over time.  Upad acitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability  to 
decrease joint inflammation and damage mediated by  JAK1 signaling while having 
minimal inhibitory  effects on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could potentially  minimize some of 
the reported safet y concer ns with non -selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be 
mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways.  The Phase 2 program 
with upadacitinib demonstrated efficacy  for improvement in signs and s ymptoms of RA 
and the safety  results were co nsistent with those known to be associated with JAK 
inhibition.13-21  Taken together, the safet y and efficacy data from the Phase 2 program 
support further development of upadacitinib in Phase 3 in subjects with RA.
In view of the COVID -19 pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory  therapies on COVID -19 is being e valuated.  At this time, the effects 
of upadacitinib on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined.

Period 2
To evaluate the long -term safet y, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD (for 
subjects in Japan onl y), 15 mg QD, and 30 mg QD in subjects with RA who have 
completed Period 1.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods and a Japan sub -study .  
Period 1 is a 48- week randomi zed, double -blind, parallel -group, active comparator 
controlled treatment period designed to compare the safet y and efficacy  of upadacitinib 
7.5mg QD monotherap y (for subjects in Japan only), 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 30 mg 
QD monotherap y versus MTX monot herap y in adult MTX -naïve subjects with 
moderatel y to severel y active RA.  Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherap y and 30 mg QD monotherap y versus MTX 
monotherap y for the prevention of structural progression. Period 2 is a long -term 
extension to evaluate the long -term safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of upadacitinib (7.5, 
15, or 30 mg QD) in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.   Starting with 
Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will receive 
open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Subjects receiving MTX will receive open-label 
MTX.
The study  is designed to enroll approximately  975 subjects at approximately  
330study centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory  objectives without enrolling 
an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the 
target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility  that additional subjects 
in screening may  not be enrolled.
The study  duration wil l include a 35 -day screening period, a 48 -week randomized, 
double -blind, parallel -group, active -comparator controlled treatment period (Period 1); a  
Upadacitinib

34
212week long -term extension period (blinded until the last subject completes the last visit 
of Period 1) ( Period 2); and a 30 -day follow -up (call or site visit).
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment Groups 2, 3 and 4 below, except 
for subjects from Japan, who will be randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4:
●Group 1:  Upadacit inib 7.5mg QD monotherap y (subjects in Japan only ; 
N = 75)
● Group 2 :  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherap y (N = 300) (includes 
37subjects from Japan)
● Group 3 :  Upadacitinib 30 mg QD monotherap y (N = 300) (includes 
37subjects from Japan)
● Group 4 :  MTX monotherapy  (N = 300) (includes 37 subjects from Japan)
Each subject will be instructed to take 2 capsules once weekl y (MTX and/or matching 
placebo) and 1 tablet once daily ( upadacitinib or matching placebo) to maintain blinding.  
MTX and matching placebo will be assigned via the Interactive Response Technology  
(IRT) sy stem, and distributed as identical capsules in blister packs, to provide the correct 
total dose for each individual subject and to maintain blinding during and after MTX 
titration (Pe riod 1 and Period 2).  Detailed dosing instructions can be found in the Subject 
Dosing Diary  and Instructions. Starting with Amendment 6 subjects receiving MTX will 
receive open- label MTX tablets in quantities sufficient to cover their respective dose.
Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD, or 30 mg QD will start 
on their respective upadacitinib dose at Baseline.  Subjects who are assigned to the MTX 
treatment group will start oral MTX treatment at 10 mg/week and will be titrated up to 
20mg/week (increase b y 5 mg every 4 weeks), as tolerated, b y Week 8 (minimum 
15mg/week final dose required, with documentation of intolerance of > 15 mg/week).  
(For subjects in Japan:  start at 7.5 mg/week with titration up to 10 mg/week at Week 4 
and to 15 mg/week, as tolerated, b y Week 8; minimum of 7.5 mg/week for final dose is 
required, with documentation of intolerance of > 7.5 mg/week).  After completion of 
MTX (or placebo) titration, a single dose reduction of study drug (b y 5 mg of MTX) is

allowed for safet y reasons, up to Week 26, as long as the subject remains on 
≥15mg/week of MTX (or matching placebo) weekly (for subjects in Japan:  
≥7.5 mg/week).  In addition, all subjects should take a dietary supplement of oral folic 
acid (or equivale nt) throughout study  participation.  Folic acid dosing and timing of 
regimen should be followed according to Investigator 's discretion.  Rescue therap y has 
been defined for Weeks 12 through 24, Week 26, and Weeks 36 through 40.  Starting at 
the Week 48 Visit (after Week 48 assessments have been performed) and thereafter, 
initiation of or change in background RA medication(s), including corticosteroids, non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen/paracetamol, and 
csDMARDs (concomitant use o f up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of MTX and 
leflunomide) is allowed as per local label.
Rescue therap y for those subjects who meet the following criteria from Week 12 through 
Week 24 are as follows:
Starting at Week 12 through Week 24, those who d o not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in 
both TJC and SJC compared with baseline at two consecutive visits will continue on their 
blinded therap y and the Investigator should optimize (initiate or increase) background RA 
medications:  NSAIDs, corticosteroids (ora l ≤ 10 mg/day  prednisone equivalent or 
prednisone equivalent ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day  for 3 consecutive day s) and/or low -potency  
analgesics.
Rescue therapy for those subjects who meet the following criteria at Week 26 are as 
follows:
1. Subjects who were originally  randomized to MTX:
●Those who do not achieve CR by  CDAI: 
○but achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared with 
baseline will continue on blinded MTX and the Investigator should 
optimize (initiate or increase) background RA medications:  NSAI Ds, 
corticosteroids (oral ≤ 10 mg/day  prednisone equivalent and up to 2 local 
injections), low -potency  analgesics and csDMARDs (only  1 of the

following:  sulfasalazine, hy droxychloroquine or chloroquine) throughout 
the remainder of Period 1 and until the study  is unblinded.
○and do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared 
with baseline will be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive blinded 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD or 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD (for subjects in Japan:  
randomize 1:1:1 to receive upadaci tinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD, or 30 mg 
QD) while continuing MTX treatment in a blinded manner and will remain 
on upadacitinib plus MTX throughout the remainder of Period 1 and until 
the study  is unblinded.
●Those who achieve Clinical Remission (CR) by  clinical disease activity  index 
(CDAI) (CDAI ≤ 2.8) at Week 26 will continue blinded treatment with MTX 
throughout the remainder of Period 1 and until the study is unblinded (the 
study  is unblinded when all subjects have completed Period 1).
2. Subjects who were orig inally  randomized to upadacitinib :
●Those who do not achieve CR by  CDAI:
○but achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared with 
baseline will continue on blinded upadacitinib and the I nvestigator should 
optimize (initiate or increase) background RA medications:  NSAI Ds, 
corticosteroids (oral ≤ 10 mg/day  prednisone equivalent and up to 2 local 
injections), low potency  analgesics and csDMARDs (only  1 of the 
following:  sulfasalazine, hy droxychloroquine or chloroquine) throughout 
the remainder of Period 1 and until the study  is unblinded. 
○and do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared 
with baseline will add MTX 10 mg/week (7.5 mg for Japan) to 
upadacitinib in a blinded manner and will remain on upadacitinib plus 
MTX 10 mg/week (7.5 mg for Japan) throughout the remainder of Period 1 
and until the study  is unblinded.
●Those who achieve Clinical Remission (CR) by  CDAI (CDAI ≤ 2.8) at 
Week 26 will continue blinded treatment with upadacitinib throughout the 
remainder of Period 1 and until the study  is unblinded (the study  is unblinded 
when all subjects have completed Period 1).

Rescue therap y for those subjects who meet the following criteria from Week 36 through 
Week 40 are as follows:
●Starting at Week 36 through Week 40, those who do not achieve ≥ 20% 
improvement in both TJC and SJC compared with baseline at two consecutive 
visits will continue on their blinded therap y and the Investigator should 
optimize (initiate or increase) background RA medications:  NSAI Ds, 
corticosteroids (oral ≤ 10mg/day  prednisone equivalent or prednisone 
equivalent ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day  for 3 consecutive day s and up to 2 local injections), 
low-potency  analgesics and csDMARDs (onl y 1 of the following:  
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine or chloroquine).
An unblinded anal ysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Week 24 for 
the purpose of regulatory submission.  To maintain integrit y of the trial and avoid 
introduction of bias, study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of 
Period 1.  A dditional unblinded anal yses may  be conducted after the first unblinded 
analysis for regulatory  purposes.
Each subject will undergo a maximum of 3 scheduled visits for x -ray examination of 
bilateral hands and feet during Period 1 (unless unscheduled repeat imaging is needed due 
to failure to meet the quality  requirements) at Screening, Week 24, and 
Week 48/Premature Discontinuation.  One additional x -ray examination of bilateral hands 
and feet may  beneeded depending on the time of premature stud y drug disc ontinuation 
for those subjects that continue the study (refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for additional details) .
Subjects who complete the Week 48 Visit (e nd of Period 1) will enter the long -term 
extension, Period 2 ( 212weeks).  Subjects will continue study  treatment per assignment at 
the end of Period 1 in a blinded fashion.  When the last subject completes the last visit of 
Period 1 (Week 48), study  drug assignment in both periods may  be unblinded to the 
Sponsor and sites, and subjects would then be dispensed study drug in an open-label 
fashion until the completion of Period 2.  All subjects will continue study treatment to 
which they  were assigned at the time of study  unblinding.  Dose changes of open -label

study  drugs are not permitted during unblinded Period 2.  Background therapies may be 
adjusted as per the discretion of the investigator (refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for additional 
details on permitted background therap y in Period 2).
Each subject will undergo a maximum of 3 scheduled visits for x -ray examination of 
bilateral hands and feet during Per iod 2 (unless unscheduled repeat imaging is needed due 
to failure to meet the quality  requirements) at Week 96, Week 192, and Week 2 60.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from Period 2 will undergo an x -ray of hands and 
feet unless the previous x -ray was performed within the previous 24 weeks.
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will 
receive open- label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Subjects receiving MTX will receive open-
label MTX.

Screening Period
Within 35 day s prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full explanation of the 
study  design and stud y procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the 
screening procedures outlined in Appendix D.  Lab values can be re -tested once during

the screening period.  If the re -tested lab value(s) remain exclusionary , the subject will be 
considered a screen failure with no additional re -screening possible.  Redrawing samples 
if initial samples were unable to be analy zed would not count as a retest since initial result 
was never obtained.
Subjects that initially  screen fail for the study  are permitted to re -screen once following 
re-consent.  For additional re -screening, AbbVie The rapeutic Area Medical Director 
approval is required.  All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below 
will be repeated during re -screening.  The subject must meet all the inclusion and none of 
the exclusion criteria at the time of re -screening in order to qualify  for the study .  There is 
no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re -screen for the stud y.  If the subject 
had a complete initial screening evaluation including the assessment of an Interferon -
Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA; Qu antiFERON Tuberculosis [TB] Gold I n Tube test) or a 
purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent), or chest x -ray and 
electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re -screening 
provided the conditions noted in Sectio n 5.2 are met and no more than 90 day s have 
passed.
Period 1 (48 -Week Randomized, Double -Blind Treatment Period)
Period 1 will begin at the Baselin e Visit (Day  1) and will end at the Week 48 Visit.  At the 
Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study  and 
randomized to double -blind treatment.  During this period o f the stud y, subjects will visit 
the study  site at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 26, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 48.  A ± 3 day 
window is permitted around scheduled stud y visits until Week 32 and then ± 7days for 
the remainder of the period.  The last dose of study  drug in Period 1 is taken the day  prior 
to the Week 48 Visit.  Subjects who complete Period 1, but decide not to continue in 
Period 2 should complete a 30 day  follow -up visit after the last dose of study  drug.

42
Period 2 (Long- Term Extension Period [212 Weeks])
Period 2 will begin at Week 48 Visit after all assessments have been completed.  During 
Period 2, subjects will visit the study  site at Weeks 60, 72, 84, 96, every  12 weeks through 
Week 240, and Week 260/PD.  A ± 7- day window is permitted around scheduled study  
visits.   Starting at Week 48, subjects who fail to show at least 20% improvement in both 
TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits, despite optimization of 
background RA therapies (see Section 5.2.3.1 for permitted background RA therapies), 
will be discontinued from study  drug.  Therefore, the earliest discontinuation would be at 
Week 60, after completion of all Week 60 study  visit activities.
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will 
receive open- label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Subjects receiving MTX will receive open-
label MTX.
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Stu dy Participation (Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may  discontinue study  drug treatment, but may  choose to continue to participate 
in the study  (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study  drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as 
soon as possible, preferably  within 2 weeks , and preferabl y prior to initiation of another 
therap y.  To minimize missing data for efficacy  and safet y assessments, subjects who 
prematurel y discontinue study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all 
regularl y scheduled visits as outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix Dand 
Appendix F), unless subjects have decided to discontinue study  participation entirely  
(withdrawal of informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific 
importance of their data e ven if they  discontinue treatment with study  drug earl y.  
Following discontinuation of study  drug, the subject should be treated in accordance with 
the investigator' s best clinical judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to 
continue participat ion in the study .  In addition, all future rescue -and efficacy -driven 
discontinuation criteria no longer appl y.  This includes 20% TJC/SJC calculations at 
Weeks 12 –24, Weeks 36 – 40 and Week 48 and thereafter, as well as CDAI calculation

at Week 26, if applicable.  If at an y point a subject no longer wants to provide assessments 
(withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study  drug, a second PD 
visit is not required.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent) ( Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may withdraw from the study  completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for 
any reason at any  time (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  If a subject 
prematurel y discontinues study drug treatment and study participation (withdrawal of 
informed consent) the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation Visit (PD 
Visit) should be completed as soon as p ossible, preferabl y within 2 weeks of study drug 
discontinuation and preferably prior to initiation of another therap y.  In addition, if the 
subject is willing, a 30 -day follow- up visit (or phone call if a visit is not possible) may  
occur to determine the status of any  ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any  new 
AEs/SAEs.
Follow -Up Visit
A Follow -Up Visit will occur approximately  30 day s after the last dose of study  drug to 
obtain information on any  new or ongoing AE/SAEs, and to collect vital signs and clinical 
laboratory  tests.
Subjects will complete the Follow -Up Visit when they  have either:
●Completed the last visit of Period 1 (Week 48), but decided not to participate 
in the extension Period 2; OR
●Completed the last visit of Period 2 (Week 26 0); OR
●Prematurel y discontinued study drug and/or study participation.  This visit 
may be a telephone call if a site visit is not possible.  Vital signs and laboratory  
test may  not be required.  The Follow -Up Visit is not applicable for subjects 
who discontinued st udy drug and continued stud y participation and completed 
at least one study visit at least approximately 30 days after last dose.

5.2.3 Prior, Concomitant, and Prohibited Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements including folic acid) that the subject is receiving 
within 28 day s prior to Screening, or receives during the stud y, must be recorded along 
with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage 
information including dose, route and frequency  on the appropriate electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  Also, me dications including but not limited to DMARDs taken for RA 
(based on subject recollection and available medical records), should be entered into the 
appropriate eCRF.
The AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director should be contacted if there are an y 
questions regarding concomitant or prior therapies.
5.2.3.1 Permitted Background RA  Therapy
Subjects should continue on their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
oral corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day ), or inhaled corticosteroids.
●If taking any of the above on a scheduled basis, they should continue to take 
them as they  did at study  entry  with no change in dose or frequency , including 
on study  visit day s.
●If not taking an y of the above at baseline, these must not be initiated except 
where permitted b y protocol -defined rescue therapy .
●If taking an y of the above, including low potency analgesics, i.e., tramadol, 
codeine, h ydrocodone, or propox yphene at baseli ne on an as -needed basis 
(PRN), they  should continue to use them for the same reason and same dose 
each time but they  should not be taken within the 24 hours prior to any  study  
visit to avoid bias in outcome measurements.
In the event of tolerability (or other safety) issues, the doses of these medications may be 
decreased or discontinued with substitution of another permitted medication from that 
class (see Section 5.2.3.2 for prohibited therapies) .  PRN use of inhaled corticosteroids is 
permitted at an y time.

In Period 1, starting at Week 26 (after Week 26 assessments have been performed) and 
thereafter, intra-articular, intramuscular, intravenous, trigger point or tender point, intra -
bursa, and intra -tendon sheath injections of corticosteroids, dosage and frequency  per 
standard of care, are allowed.  To avoid confounding effects of s ystemic absorption of 
intra-articular corticosteroids, joint injections should be avoided, if possible, within 
21days prior to the next scheduled study  visit.  For the anal ysis of the TJC and SJC, 
injected joints will be considered "not assessable "for 3 months from the time o f the 
intra-articular injection.  Refer to Section 5.2.3.3 for rescue therap y at Week 26.
In Period 2, starting at Week 48 (after Week 48 assessment s have been performed) and 
thereafter, initiation of or change in corticosteroids (including:  oral, intra -articular, trigger 
point or tender point, intra -bursa, intra -tendon sheath, intramuscular and intravenous) is 
allowed.  In addition, the initiation o f or change in NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol 
and low potency  narcotics is also permitted to optimize concomitant RA medications.  
Adding one of the following, sulfasalazine, hydrox ychloroquine, or chloroquine, is also 
permitted, as per local label.  Pe riod 2 may  be unblinded after all subjects complete 
Period 1, at which time the Investigator will know if the subject is taking MTX or MTX 
placebo.  If subject is not taking MTX, he/she may add a maximum of 2 csDMARDs, 
including MTX, leflunomide, sulfasala zine, hy droxy chloroquine, or chloroquine, but not 
MTX plus leflunomide.  For RA flare treatment, no more than 3 consecutive days of high-
dose sy stemic corticosteroids (maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day  of prednisone or its 
equivalent) are allowed, after which subject should resume his/her usual daily  oral 
corticosteroid dose.
Traditional Chinese Medicine
Traditional oral Chinese medicine cannot be initiated or changed during the study as these 
may interfere with upadacitinib metabolism and exposure and may  impa ct efficacy  and 
safet y of upadacitinib treatment.

corticosteroids (oral ≤ 10 mg/day  prednisone equivalent or predniso ne 
equivalent ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day  for 3 consecutive day s and up to 2 local injections), 
low-potency  analgesics and csDMARDs (onl y 1 of the following:  
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine or chloroquine).
5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendatio n for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/ mL. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
59
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required and a serum pregnancy test must be performed (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective me thods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day 1 (or 
earlier) through at least 180 days after the last dose of study drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associat ed with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Stud y Day 1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilatera l tubal occlusion/ligation. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
60
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received 
medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of 
the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (I UD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
●True abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements):  Refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the subject (periodic abstinence [e.g., calen dar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of t he highly  
effective birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence).
It is important to note that contraception recommendations described above are 
specificall y intended to prevent pregnancy during and after exposure to the investigational 
therapies, upadacitinib and MTX.  In Period 2, starting at Week 48, concomitant 
csDMARDs (i.e., sulfasalazine, hy droxychloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomide) can be 
prescribed, per standard of care.  The duration of contraception after discontinuation of 
these prescribed csDMARDs should be based on the local label.
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation is available, contraception measures as defined above are no 
longer required.
Additional local requirements may  appl y.  Refer to Appendix Cfor local requirements 
(Canada and Colombia).
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for male subjects receiving upadacitinib only , or 
their female partner(s).   
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
61
For a male subject receiving MTX who has a female partner who is postmenopausal or 
permanentl y sterile, no contraception is required.
A mal e subject receiving MTX who is sexually  active with female partner(s) of 
childbearing potential must agree from Study  Day  1 through 180 day s after the last dose 
of MTX study  drug to practice contraception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at lea st one of the contraceptive 
measures (as defined in the protocol for female study subjects of childbearing 
potential) .
●True abstinence: Refraining from heterosexual intercourse -when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject .  (Note:  Periodic 
abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods]
and withdrawal are not acce ptable).
Additionally , male subjects receiving MTX must agree not to donate sperm from Study  
Day 1 through 180 day s after the last dose of MTX study  drug.
Male subjects receiving MTX are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of 
becoming pregnant and for reporting an y pregnancy  to the study  doctor.  
It is important to note that contraception and sperm donation recommend ations described 
above are specificall y intended to prevent pregnancy during and after exposure to the 
investigational therap y, MTX.   In Period 2, starting at Week 48, concomitant csDMARDs 
(i.e., sulfasalazine, h ydrox ychloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomi de) can be prescribed, 
per standard of care.  The duration of contraception and requirement not to donate sperm 
after discontinuation of these prescribed csDMARDs should be based on the local label.
Additional local requirements may  appl y.  Refer to Appendix Cfor local requirements 
(Canada and Colombia).

Medical and Surgical History
A complete non -RA-related medical and surgical history , including history  of alcohol and 
nicotine use, will be take n from each subject during the Screening Visit.  Additionally , a 
list of each subject 's specific RA -related medical and surgical history will be recorded at 
Screening.  History  of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B 
vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history .  An updated medical 
history  will be obtained prior to study  drug administration at Baseline, to ensure the 
subject is still eligible for enrollment.
A detailed medical history with respect to TB risk factor s will be documented in the study  
source documentation.  This information will include BCG vaccination, cohabitation with 
individuals who have had TB, and travel to, residence in, or work in TB endemic 
locations.
Patient Questionnaires
Subjects will comple te the following questionnaires as specified in Appendix Dand 
Appendix F; a validated translation will be provided in their local language, as applicable:
Period 1
●Patient 's Global Assessment of Disease Activity  Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
(Appendix J)
●Patient 's Assessment of Pain VAS (Appendix K)
●Health Assessment Questionnaire –Disability  Index (HAQ -DI) to assess the 
physical function and health -related quality  of life of each subject

each subject ( Appendix L)
●Patient 's Assessment of Severit y and Duration of Morning Stiffness NRS 
(Appendix M)*
*Paper; all other patient -reported outcomes (PROs) collected electronically .
The subject should complete the questionnaires before site perso nnel perform any  clinical 
assessments and before any  interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing 
the subject 's response.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, questionnaires will be 
completed b y the subject at the next feasible visit.
TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis
The TB screening tests are diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the 
subject' s epidemiology , histor y, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB.
At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB b y a risk 
assessment form ( Appendix I) and tested for TB infection by  QuantiFERON -TB Gold test.  
The PPD skin test should be utilized only  when a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is not 
possible for an y reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).  The site staff 
will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
67
If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (and/or PPD) test (or IGRA 
equivalent such as T -SPOT TB test) within 90 day s prior to Screening and source 
documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has 
changed in the subject 's medical history  to warrant a repeat test.  These cases may be 
discussed with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.  The results of the TB 
test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or most recent evaluation, an 
annual TB re -test will be performed.  The TB test(s) to be performed depends on local 
guidelines and whether or not the site has capacit y to perform QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
testing (see below).  If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a chest x -ray 
(CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus 
latent TB.  Expert consultation can be considered per Investigator 's discretion.  Any  
positive TB test result after the patient has started study drug should be reported as an 
adverse event (AE).
TB Test:
●For regions that require both PPD and QuantiFERON -TB Gold testing, both 
will be performed.  A positive TB test is defined by  local guidelines (for 
example, in some countries, both PPD and QuantiFERON- TB Gold are 
performe d, and if either one is positive, the TB test is considered positive). 
●In the absence of local guidelines defining a positive result when both PPD 
and QuantiFERON -TB Gold tests are performed, then the QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold test result will be the TB test re sult (QuantiFERON supersedes PPD).
●If a site has the capacit y to perform both PPD and QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
tests, and local guidelines require onl y one test to be performed, then the 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold is the preferred test.  At a site with capacit y to 
perform both tests, whatever TB test method (i.e., PPD or QuantiFERON- TB 
Gold or other IGRA) was performed at screening, then the subject should have 
their annual TB test performed with the same test method.
●If QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is NOT possible (or if both the 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold testand the PPD skin test are required per local  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
68
guidelines) :  the PPD skin test (also known as a TB skin test) will be 
performed according to standard clinical practice. The TB skin test should be 
read b y alicensed healthca re professional between 48 and 72 hours after 
administration.  A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be 
rescheduled for another skin test.  The reaction will be measured in millimeters 
(mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm for RA subjects is considered a 
positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm "not 
"negative. "  Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB skin test in 
the past should not be re -exposed and the TB Skin Test should be considered
positive with no requirement for subsequent testing with either PPD or 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold test .
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator 
should perform a local QuantiFERON- TB Gold test (or through the central 
laboratory  if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result.  I f testing 
remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be 
positive for the purpose of this study .  If the testing result is negative, then the 
patient is considered to be negative.
●Interpretation of a positive annual TB test in low risk subjects:  I n cases where 
the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test by  the central laboratory  is positive and the 
Investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB and has no clinical 
suspicion of TB, the In vestigator may  perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory  if not locally  available) to 
confirm the positive test result.  If the repeat testing result is negative, the 
Investigator may  consider the test to be negative based on his/her clinical 
judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the test is 
considered positive.
●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T -SPOT TB 
test) may  be substituted for the Qua ntiFERON -TB Gold test.
●Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold Test (or equivalent) and/or PPD are not required to repeat either test 
during the stud y and should be considered positive.  Annual TB questionnaire 
should be completed for ALL subjects.

Subjects with a negative TB test and CXR not suggestive of active TB or prior TB 
exposure may  be enrolled.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent 
TB, including signs and sy mptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or s ymptoms and a 
CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see 
below).  Subjects with evidence of active TB may  not be enrolled.
TB Prophylaxis:
At Screening, if the subject has evidence of a latent TB infection (positive TB test and the 
subject has a CXR not suggestive of active TB), prophylactic treatment must be initiated 
at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study  drug (or per local guide lines, whichever is 
longer).  The proph ylaxis needs to be completed; however, the full course of proph ylaxis 
does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study drug.  If the Investigator 
deems that it is necessary, consultation with a TB expert could be considered. 
Note:  Rifampicin or Rifapentine is Not Allowed for TB prophylaxis
In Period 2, when stud y drug has been unblinded, rifampicin or rifapentine are allowed for 
TB proph ylaxis for subjects not receiving upadacitinib.
Subjects with a pri or history  of latent TB that have documented completion of a full 
course of anti -TB therapy  within 1 y ear prior to first study  drug administration will be 
allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject 's medical history  to 
warrant r epeat treatment.
Obtain a CXR annuall y for subjects with newl y identified TB risk factors as determined 
by the TB risk assessment form (Appendix I), or for subjects living in areas endemic for 
TB or for subjects with newly positive PPD or QuantiFERON -TB Gold test.
For subjects with seroconversion on an annual TB test, if a CXR cannot be done due to 
state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, the Investiga tor should contact  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
70
the AbbVie TA MD to determine if the subject may continue on study drug.  CXR should 
be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospital/facility.
Subjects with a documented completion of a full course of anti -TB therapy  greater than 
1year prior to first study  drug administration may be allowed to enter the study  only after 
consultation with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
Newl y initiated proph ylactic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and i n the source 
documents.  Prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF.
During the study , subjects with new evidence of latent TB should initiate prophylactic 
treatment immediatel y per local guidelines.  Study drug(s) should notbe withheld and 
Isoniazid and/or rifampin/rifapentine should be initiated and 2 to 4 weeks later (per local 
guidelines), subject should be re -evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and sy mptoms of 
isoniazid toxicity . 
In Period 2, when stud y drug has been unblinded, rifampicin or ri fapentine are allowed for 
TB proph ylaxis for subjects not receiving upadacitinib. 
If the subject is experiencing signs or s ymptoms suspicious for TB or something has 
changed in the subject 's medical history  to warrant a repeat test before the next schedul ed 
annual TB re -test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the 
AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
Chest X- Ray (CXR)
A CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) is required:
●For all subjects at Screening to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically  
relevant findings.  The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous 
normal CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) within 90 days of Screening, 
provided all source documentation is available at the site as o utlined below and 
provided nothing has changed in the subject 's medical history  to warrant a 
repeat test. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
71
●Annually  for subjects with newly  identified TB risk factors as determined by 
the TB risk assessment form (Appendix I) or for subjects living in areas 
endemic for TB or for subjects with newly positive PPD and/or 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold test.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVI D-19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit requires 
completion of a CXR, the CXR will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit, unless 
the Investigator has determined, based on clinical jud gement, that a CXR is required to 
ensure that it is safe to continue study drug administration. In this case, CXR should be 
performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospital/facility.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any  time du ring the stud y as warranted, based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.
A radiologist or pulmonologist must perform an assessment of the CXR.  The Principal 
Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of an y findings and will sign and date 
the report.  In the assessment of the CXR, the Principal Investigator or his/her delegate 
must indicate the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural 
scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB.  If the CXR demonstrates changes 
suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleural 
thickening) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator 
should contact the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director before enrolling the subjec t.
12-Lead ECG
For all subjects, a resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening and every  
48weeks thereafter, as specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  A qualified phy sician 
will interpret the clinical significance of any abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG.  
ECG with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia 's correction formula 
(QTcF) should be reported (or calculated) and documented in the source documents and 
later transcribed on to the appropriat e eCRF if QTcF prolongation is observed.  A valid 
QTcF cannot be calculated in subjects who have a pacemaker or supraventricular or  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
72
ventricular conduction abnormalities.  In case of QTcF prolongation, the baseline QTcF 
will need to be entered into the appr opriate eCRF for comparison as well.  In addition, any  
clinically  significant findings will be documented in the source documents and later 
transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.  Each signed original ECG will be monitored by 
the responsible site monitor and kept with subject 's source documents onsite.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at 
Screening will not be required, provided source documentation is available and provided 
nothing has changed in the subject 's medical history  to warrant a repeat test.  If there are 
other findings that are clinically significant, the Investigator must contact the AbbVie 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director before enrolling the subject.
Subjects can have a repeat ECG at an y time duri ng the stud y as warranted, based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit requires 
completion of an ECG, the ECG will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit, 
unless the Investigator has determined, based on clinical judgement, that an ECG is 
required to ensure that it is safe to continue stud y drug administration. In this case, the 
ECG should be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local 
hospital/facility .
X-Rays of Hands and Feet
Detailed instructions for performing and transmitting the stud y related x -rays of hands and 
feet are provided in a separate Imaging Acquisitio n Guideline (IAG)/Site Operational 
Manual.
Handling of X- Rays of Hands and Feet at Screening
Screening x- rays of bilateral hands (posterior -anterior view) and bilateral feet 
(anteroposterior view) must be performed within the 35- day screening period. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
73
Once a subject has been deemed eligible to participate and has had screening x -rays 
performed, the x -rays will be sent to the central imaging laboratory  designated by  the 
Sponsor.  Digitalized images may be acceptable, provided that they  meet the 
specifications outlined in the IAG/Site Operations Manual.  X -rays not meeting the 
quality  requirements must be repeated within the 35 -day screening window.  Subjects can 
receive the first dose of study  drug if the x -rays have been determined to be of sufficient 
quality by the central imaging laboratory .
Screening x- rays of hands and feet will serve as baseline x -rays for scoring purposes.
Joint x -rays will be sent to the central imaging vendor designated b y the Sponsor.  The x-
rays will only  be assessed by  the imaging vendor for erosions and joint space narrowing, 
and will not be assessed for an y other clinically significant findings that may impact a 
subject' s health.
Handling of X- Rays of Hands and Feet after Baseline
Handling of x -rays of hands and feet after baseline in Period 1 is illustrated in Figure 3.  
All subjects (regardless of response) will receive Week 24 x -rays (Figure 3, box A) and 
Week 48 x -rays (Figure 3, box B).
If a subject prematurely  discontinues from the study  (withdrawal of informed consent), 
depending on the time of discontinuation, new x -rays might be needed.
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue before Week 12 will not get x -rays 
(Figure 3, box C)
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from Week 12 to before Week 24 
(≥Week 12 and < Week 24), will have new x -rays performed ( Figure 3, 
boxD).
●Subjects who prema turely  discontinue after Week 24 to before Week 36 
(>Week 24 and < Week 36), will not have x-rays performed (Figure 3,box E).

(≥Week 36 and < Week 48), will have new x -rays performed ( Figure 3, 
boxF).
If a subject prematurely  discontinues from study  drug but continues to participate in the 
study , subject should follow the regular visit schedule as outlined in Appendix Dand 
Appendix F, including performance of scheduled x -rays of hands and feet.  However, 
depending on the time of study  drug discontinuation in Period 1, ne w x-rays might be 
needed.
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study  drug before Week 12 will 
not get new x-rays.
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study drug from Week 12 to 
Week 16 (≥Week 12 and ≤ Week 16), will have new x -rays performed.
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study  drug after Week 16to 
Week 24(>Week 16 and ≤Week 24), will have x-rays performed at Week 24 
(standard).
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study  drug after Week 24to 
Week 36(>Week 24 and <Week 36), will not have new x-rays performed .
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study  drug from Week 36 to 
Week 40(≥Week 36 and ≤Week 40), will have new x-rays performed. 
●Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study  drug after Week 40to 
Week 48(>Week 40 and ≤Week 48), will have x-rays performed at Week 48 
(standard).
X-rays will be sent to the central imaging laboratory  designated by  the Sponsor.  
Digitalized images may  be acceptable, provided that they  meet the specifications outlined 
in the IAG/Site Operations Manual.  X- rays not meeting the quality requirements must be 
repeated.
Overall in Period 1, each subject will undergo a maximum of 3 scheduled visits for x -ray 
examination of bilateral hands and feet (unless unscheduled repeat imaging is needed due  
Upadacitinib

to failure to meet the quality  requirements) at Screening, Week 24, and Week 48/PD.  
One additional x -ray examination of bilateral hands and feet may  beneeded depending on 
the time of premature study  drug discontinuation for those subjects th at continue the 
study .
In Period 2, a follow- up x-ray of hands and feet is planned at Week 96, Week 192, and 
Week 26 0.  Subjects who prematurel y discontinue from Period 2 will undergo an x -ray of 
hands and feet unless the previous x -ray was performed within the previous 24 weeks.  
Images will be sent to the central imaging laboratory designated b y the Sponsor.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situat ions, if a visit by  phone or video 
conference occurs at one of the designated stud y visits specified to complete x -rays of 
hands and feet, it will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit.

Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in sitting position, pulse 
rate, respiratory  rate, a nd body  temperature will be obtained at visits specified in 
Appendix Dand Appendix F.  Blood pressure, pulse rate, bod y temperature, and 
respiratory  rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
Physical Examination
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the designated study  visits as 
specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The physical examination at the Baseline Visit 
will serve as the baseline phy sical examination for the entire stud y.  Physical examination 
abnormalities noted b y the Inv estigator at Baseline prior to the first dose of study  drug 
will be recorded in the subject 's medical history ; abnormalities noted after the first dose of 
study  drug will be evaluated and documented b y the Investigator as to whether or not the 
abnormality  is an AE (see Section 6.1.1.1 for AE definition).  All findings whether related 
to an AE or part of each subject 's medical history  will be captured on the appropriate 
eCRF page.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit by phone or video 
conference occurs at one of the designated stu dy visits specified to complete phy sical 
examination, the complete phy sical examination will be performed at the next feasible 
visit.
At any  time, a sy mptom -directed ph ysical examination can be performed as deemed 
necessary  by the Investigator.
Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS
At visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F, the Phy sician will rate global 
assessment of subject 's current disease activit y ranging from 0 to 100 independent of the 
subject' s self -assessment using the VAS, which consists of a horizontal 100 mm li ne

M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
78
anchored at either end b y opposite adjectives reflecting the spectrum/severity of the 
parameters assessed ( Appendix G).
Due to a state of emergen cy or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the Phy sician Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity  will be completed by  the ph ysician at the next feasible 
visit.
TJC and SJC Asse ssment
TJC Assessment
An assessment of 68 joints ( Appendix H) will be done for tenderness b y pressure 
manipulation on phy sical examination at visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  
Joint pain/tenderness will be classified as:  present ( "1"), absent ( "0"), replaced ( "9") or no 
assessment ( "NA").
SJC Assessment
An assessment of 66 joints ( Appendix H) will be done by directed phys ical examination at 
visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The joints to be examined for swelling 
are the same as those examined for tendernes s, except the hip joints are excluded.  Joint 
swelling will be classified as present ( "1"), absent ( "0"), replaced ( "9") or no assessment 
("NA").
Any injected joints will be considered as "not assessed" (" NA") for 3 months from the 
time of the intra -articular injection.
If possible, the TJC and SJC should be performed by  an independent and blinded joint 
assessor who should not perform an y other stud y related procedures.
In order to minimize variability , the same independent joint assessor should evaluate the 
subject at each visit for the duration of the trial as much as possible.  A back -up 
independent joint assessor should be identified.  The independent joint assessors should  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
79
be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, physician 's assista nt, phy sician).  An y 
other joint assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments.  I t is 
the responsibility  of the Investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained 
to perform joint assessments.  If the independent a ssessor is not available, the pre -
identified back- up assessor should perform such assessments.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the TJC and SJC will be 
performed at the next feasible visit by  the independent joint assessor, if possible.
CDAI
The CDAI calculation is required to determine if a subject fails to achieve Clinical 
Remission at the Week 26 visit.  An I nteractive Response Technology  (IRT) will calculate 
CDAI  with input from site personnel on joint counts and the subject 's and phy sician 's 
Global Assessment of RA Disease Activity  score.  A worksheet will be provided to 
capture the components required for IRT entry  to obtain the CDAI cal culation.
The calculation used to determine CDAI score at Week 26 is as follows:
CDAI  = TJC28 + SJC28 + PtGA + PhGA
NOTE:  As described in the section pertaining to Rescue Therap y, the Investigator should 
optimize background RA therapies in subjects who fa il to achieve a CDAI ≤ 2.8 at 
Week 26, but achieve at least 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC.
Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy  test will be performed for all women of child bearing potential at the 
Screening Visit.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by  the central 
laboratory .  If the serum pregnancy  test is positive the subject is considered a screen 
failure.  If the serum pregnancy  test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ 3 day s later to 
determine eligibility .  If the repeat seru m pregnancy  test is: 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
80
●Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;
●Still borderline, ≥ 3 day s later, this will be considered documentation of 
continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the trial.
In Period 1, a urine pregnancy  test will be performed for all women of childbearing 
potential at the Baseline Visit prior to the first dose of study drug and at all subsequent 
visits.  More frequent pregnancy  tests will be performed throughout the study  if required 
per local/country  requirements.
●If the baseline urine pregnancy  test performed at the site is negative, then 
dosing with study  drug may  begin.  If the baseline urine pregnancy  test 
performed at the site is positiv e, dosing with study drug must be withheld and 
a serum pregnancy  test is required.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to 
and performed b y the central laboratory.  If the serum pregnancy test is 
positive, study  drug must be permanently  discontinued.  In the event a 
pregnancy  test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required.
●If a urine pregnancy  test post baseline is positive, study  drug needs to be 
temporaril y discontinued and a serum pregnancy test is required.  The serum 
pregnancy  test will be sen t to and performed b y the central laboratory.  If the 
serum pregnancy  test is negative, study  drug may  be restarted.  If the serum 
pregnancy  test is positive, study  drug must be permanently  discontinued.
In Period 2, for women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy  test will be performed 
at all visits and monthly  at home between scheduled study  visits.  The results of the 
monthly  at home tests will be communicated to the site.  If a urine pregnancy  test is 
positive, the subject must stop dosing, retu rn to the study  site and have blood drawn for a 
serum pregnancy  test that will be analy zed at the central laboratory .
In the event a urine pregnancy  test may  not be performed at the protocol specified visits 
due to study  modifications related to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like 
COVID- 19, it can be performed by subjects at a local laboratory or it is possible for the 
Investigator to arrange a shipment from the study  site directly  to the subject 's home of  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
81
urine pregnancy  test kits to have the u rine pregnancy  test done at home (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 -Sub-Section "Study  Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance "for 
details). Home urine pregnancy  test should be performed monthly , regardless of ability  to 
obtain other laboratory  samples.
At each visit, the study  staff should review the pregnancy  avoidance recommendations 
with each subject of childbearing potential and male subjects receiving MTX with a 
partner of childbearing potential, and document this discussion in the subject 's source 
records.
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation as described in Section 5.2.4 is available, pregnancy  testing 
is no longer required.
A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation in this study  or be 
allowed to continue study drug.
Clinical L aboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained for the clinical laboratory tests listed in Table 2.  Unscheduled 
clinical labs may  be obtained at an y time d uring the study  if deemed appropriate per 
Investigator 's discretion.  A certified central laboratory  will be utilized to process and 
provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  All abnormal laboratory tests that are 
considered clinically  significan t by the Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory  
resolution.
The central laboratory  chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing, and shipping of these samples.
If travel restrictions or other changes in loca l regulations due to state of emergency  or 
pandemic situation like COVID -19 prevent the subject from having blood drawn for 
laboratory  testing at the study  site, it is possible for the Investigator to arrange for subjects 
to have laboratory  work done at a local lab, hospital, or other facility  to ensure the safet y  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
82
assessments are conducted per protocol.  Local lab results should be obtained along with 
reference ranges and kept within the subjects 'source documentation.  L ocal lab results 
should be reviewed by  the investigator or designee as soon as possible and documented in 
the eCRF.
If laboratory  samples cannot be obtained, study  drug administration may  be continued 
provided labs have been obtained within the prior 3 months, the investigator has reviewed 
the laboratory  results and confirmed and discussed with the subject that there is no safet y 
concern for the subject to continue use of the study drug in the absence of current lab 
results.  The subject should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as fea sible and no 
later than the next scheduled visit in order to continue the study drug administration.
If laboratory  results are not available within the prior 3 months/two consecutive 12 -week 
intervals, study  drug dispensation is not allowed until the requi red laboratory  tests are 
completed to ensure the safet y assessments are conducted per protocol.
Blood samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests at visits specified in Appendix D
and Appendix F.  Blood draws should be performed only  after all questionnaires 
(HAQ -DI, Patient 's Assessment of Pain, etc.), clinical assessments, and vital sign 
determinations are obtained.
For clinic visits where samples for serum chemistry tests are collected, subjects should be 
fasting (a minimum 8 -hour fast) whenever possible.  If a subject is not able to f ast when 
necessary , due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in 
study  source documentation.
Urine samples will be obtained for urinal ysis testing at visits specified in Appendix Dand 
Appendix F.  The central laboratory  will be responsible for performing a macro scopic 
urinaly sis (urine dipstick) on the collected urine specimens.  Specified abnormal 
macroscopic urinal yses defined as leukocy tes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater 
than negative, or glucose greater than normal will be followed up with a micr oscopic 
analysis at the central laboratory .

83
For an y laboratory  test value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to 
be clinically  significant, the Investigator should apply  the standard of care for medical 
evaluation and treatment per local guidelines:
●The Investigator will repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value.
●The Investigator will follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory  clinical 
resolution.
A laboratory  test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from st udy drug or 
requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE.

Hepatitis Screen
All subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV and HCV at Screening.
Hepatitis B:
Subjects will be test ed for the presence of HBV at Screening using the following tests:
●HBs Ag (Hepatitis B surface antigen)
●HBc Ab/anti -HBc (Hepatitis B core antibod y)
●HBs Ab/anti -HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody )
A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary .
A negativ e result for HBs Ag will be tested (automatic reflex testing) for core antibodies 
(HBc Ab) and surface antibodies (HBs Ab).
●A negative test result for HBc Ab does notrequire HBV DNA PCR qualitative 
testing and the subject may be enrolled ( Figure 4, Scenarios A and B).
●For a subject who has had a HBV vaccination (should document in the medical 
history ), a positive test resul t for HBs Ab is expected and the subject may  be 
enrolled ( Figure 4, Scenario B).*
●A positive test result for HBc Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic 
reflex testing) ( Figure 4, Scenarios C and D).
○A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection 
sensitivity  will be exclusionary .
○A subject with a negative r esult for HBV DNA may  be enrolled.
●For subjects in Japan only:  A positive result for HBs Ab/anti -HBs requires 
HBV DNA PCR testing .
○A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection 
sensitivity  will be exclusionary .
○A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may  be enrolled.

Hepatitis C:
Blood samples for Hepatitis C serology will be obtained at the Screening Visit.  A subject 
will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate active Hepatitis C (HCV 
RNA detectable in an y subject with anti HCV Ab).
HIV
Subjects with a known history of HIV infection are excluded from study  participation.  If 
required b y country  regulatory  authorities to confirm eligibility , subjects will be tested for 
antibodies to HIV at Screening.  This tes ting is to be done at a local lab.  A subject will 
not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection.  
AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of an y 
positive result.

VZV ( For Subjects in Japan Only)
Tests for varicella -zoster virus (VZV) will be performed at Screening to evaluate 
immunity  of a subject to VZV for better understanding of the safet y profile of 
upadacitinib.
To assess the cell -mediated immune status to VZV, a skin test using the VZV antigen will 
be performed.  VZV antigen is injected intradermally into the forearm of each subject, and 
the longest diameters of erythema and edema will be measured in millimeters (mm) 
between 24 (recommended) and 48 hours after the injectio n and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page along with date and time of injection and measurement.  The 
absence of er ythema or edema will be recorded as "0 mm. "
Blood samples will be used for measuring IgG -class antibodies specific to VZV to 
estimate the prior exposure to VZV of the subject.
Randomization/Drug Assignment
All Screening laboratory  results must be reviewed, signed, and dated b y the Principal 
Investigator or Sub -investigator prior to the Baseline Visit.  Subjects will not be enrolled 
into the s tudy if laboratory  or other Screening result abnormalities are deemed clinically  
significant b y the Principal I nvestigator or Sub -investigator.
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria (Section 5.2) at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study .
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio using interactive response technology  (IRT)
to treatment Groups 2, 3, and 4, below, except for subjects from Japan, who will be 
randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4:
●Group 1:  Upadacitinib 7.5mg QD monotherap y (subjects in Japan only ; 
N = 75)
● Group 2 :  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD monot herap y (N = 300) (includes 
37subjects from Japan)

Randomization will be stratified b y geographic region.
See Section 5.5.3 for details.
Study Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance
Study  drug(s) will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline (Day  1) and as specified 
in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The first dose of study  drug(s) will be administe red after 
all other Baseline (Day  1) procedures are completed.  Subjects will maintain a dosing 
diary  for all study  drug(s) administered outside of the study  visit (i.e., at home) to capture 
dosing dates and times.  At visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F, the site 
personnel will review and retain a cop y of the dosing diary , returned stud y drug kits, and 
empty  study  drug packaging to verify  compliance.
To maintain the blind in this study  with two blinded investigational stud y drugs (MTX 
and upadacitinib), each subject will be instructed to take two capsules once weekl y (MTX 
and/or matching placebo) and a tablet once dail y (upadacitinib or matching placebo).  
MTX and matching placebo will be dis tributed as identical capsules to maintain blinding 
during the MTX titration and during the rest of the study .  Starting with Amendment 6 
subjects receiving MTX will receive open- label MTX tablets in quantities sufficient to 
cover their respective dose.
Determination of which subjects are assigned to receive MTX- placebo versus 
upadacitinib placebo will be via the IRT (Interactive Response Technology), which will 
randomly  assign each subject to the appropriate treatment group in a blinded manner.
All relevant dosing information will be entered into the eCRF at each visit.

Study  drug may  be shipped from the stud y site directly to the stud y subject 's home due to 
study  modifications related to a state of emergency or pandemic situation like COVID -19 
if all the following criteria are met:
●Direct -to-patient (DTP) shipment of study  drug is allowed by  local re gulations 
and the relevant ethics committee
●Subject agrees to have the study  drug shipped directly  to their home
●Shipments may  also include other study  supplies (e.g., drug dosing diaries, in -
home urine pregnancy  test kits).  I nstructions will be provided by AbbVie as to 
how a study  site can initiate a DTP shipment using Marken, a global vendor 
selected b y AbbVie to provide this service when necessary.  Shipments of 
study  drugs from the study  site to a subject 's home will be appropriatel y 
temperature controlled (qualified shipper or temperature monitoring) within 
the labeled storage conditions.  Signature is required upon delivery; due to 
COVID- 19 related social distancing, this may  be provided b y the courier after 
delivery .  Documentation of the shipment is to be retained by the clinical site.
●AbbVie will not receive subject identify ing information related to these 
shipments, as the site will work directl y with the courier.
The study  site is responsible for meeting IRB/IEC reporting requirements related to DTP 
shipments of study  drug, and for obtaining consent to provide delivery  information to the 
courier and documenting this consent in source documents.
Optional Home Healthcare Service Due to State of Emergency or Pandemic 
Situation like COVID- 19
Subjects may  be offered the option of home healthcare visits provided b y a study  nurse or 
third- party vendor.  Study procedures conducted in the home setting may include vital 
signs and bod y weight, physical exam, blood and urine samples collection, urine 
pregnancy test, adverse event and concomitant therap y assessment including compliance 
to contraception requirements if applicable, latent TB risk assessment form, review of 
subject dosing diary , TJC and SJC performed by  the same independent joint assessor, if 
possi ble, to minimize variability .

This option can only  be offered in countries and sites that comply  with local regulatory  
and I RB/IEC requirements for homecare.  An y pre-requisite submissions or notifications 
to the site I RB/IEC and local competent health aut hority  should be made, and approvals 
must be obtained prior to implementation.
The investigator should be available via phone call if a consultation is necessary.
It is recommended that medical personnel entering a subject 's home adhere to local health 
regulations during the COVID- 19 pandemic, such as the use of Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE), as required.
If the home visits will not be performed b y site personnel, the site may be responsible for 
selecting a vendor, contracting with a vendor, and for e nsuring continued compliance with 
the terms of the Clinical Study  Agreement.
Individuals performing home visits need to be added to the delegation log.
5.3.1.2 Collection and Handling of Optional Samples for 
Exploratory  Research and Validation Studies
In Period 1, subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research and 
validation studies.  Subjects may  still participate in the study  even if they  decide not to 
participate in this optional exploratory  research/validation study .
Exploratory  resea rch can help to improve our understanding of how individuals respond 
to drugs and our ability  to predict which subjects would benefit from receiving specific 
therapies.  In addition, exploratory  research may  help to improve our understanding of 
how to diag nose and assess/monitor RA by  assessing associations between disease 
characteristics, outcomes data, and biomarkers of interest.
Validation studies, including those related to the development of potential in vitro 
diagnostic tests, may  be carried out retro spectively  in order to assess associations between 
events of interest (i.e., efficacy and/or safet y events) and candidate biomarkers.

Optional samples may  be collected to conduct exploratory  investigations into known and 
novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarker s to be anal yzed may  include, but are not 
limited to nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or metabolites.
Biomarker assessments may  be used to assess and generate prognostic, predictive, 
pharmacod ynamic, or surrogate biomarker signatures.  These assessments ma y be 
explored in the context of RA or related conditions and/or upadacitinib or drugs of similar 
classes.  These results from these anal yses are exploratory  in nature and may  not be 
included with the clinical study report (CSR).
The samples may  also be use d to develop new therapies, research methods or technologies.

used to validate putative biomarker signatures obtained from a prospective study, leading 
to the developm ent of diagnostic tests.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Subjects can request to be discontinued from participating in the stud y at any time for an y 
reason, including but not limited to disease progression or lack of response to treatment.  
The Investigator may  discontinue any  subject 's participation for an y reason, including an 
AE, safet y concerns, lack of efficacy, or failure to comply with the protocol.  See 
Section 6.1.7 for toxicity  management criteria.
Subjects will have study  drug discontinued immediately  if any  of the following occur:
●Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  result s or AEs, which rule out 
continuation of the study  drug, as determined b y the Investigator orthe 
AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Serious infections (e.g., sepsis) which cannot be adequatel y controlled within 
2weeks by anti-infective treatment o r would put the subject at risk for 
continued participation in the trial as determined by the Investigator .
●The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
●The subject requests withdrawal from the study.
●Inclusion or exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study  drug, when continuation of the study  drug would place the subject at risk 
as determined b y the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuatio n of the 
study  drug would place the subject at risk, as determined by  the AbbVie 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Subject is non- compliant with TB proph ylaxis (if applicable) or develops 
active TB at any time during the stud y.
●The subject becomes pregnant while on study  drug.
●Malignancy , except for localized NMSC or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
100
●Subject is significantl y non-compliant with study  procedures which would put 
the subject at risk for continued participation as determined by the Investigator 
or the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Subject develops a gastrointestinal perforation (other than due to appendicitis 
or mechanical injury ).
●Subject with disease progression or not responding to treatment as determined 
by the Investigator.
●Confi rmed diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or 
non-cardiac, non- neurologic arterial thrombosis.
●Starting at Week 48, subjects who fail to show at least 20% improvement in 
both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits, despite 
optimization of background RA therapies (see Section 5.2.3.1 for permitted 
background RA therapies), willbe discontinued from study  drug.  Therefor e, 
the earliest discontinuation would be at Week 60, after completion of all Week 
60 study  visit activities.
In order to minimize missing data for efficacy and safet y assessments, subjects who 
prematurel y discontinue study drug treatment or study particip ation should complete a 
Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as described in Section 5.1.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of t he last study  drug dose and the 
primary  reason for discontinuation of study  drug or study  participation.  The information 
will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not 
interfere with the initiation of an y new treatmen ts or therapeutic modalities that the 
Investigator feels are necessary  to treat the subject 's condition.  Following discontinuation 
of study  drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator 's best clinical 
judgment, irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study.
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, it has been necessary  to employ  mitigation strategies to 
enable the investigator to ensure subject safet y and continuity of care.
During a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, the investigator 
should contact the sponsor medical contact before discontinuing a subject from the study  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
101
or study  drug for a reason other than "planned per protocol, "to ensure all acceptable 
mitigation steps have been explored.
Lost to Follow -Up
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, two phone calls must 
be made and one certified letter must be sent and d ocumented in the subject 's source 
documentation.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  terminate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at an y study  site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the inte nded 
termination.  The Investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately 
notify  the Investigator b y telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments A dministered
There are two a ctive study  drugs in this study .  The first is daily  upadacitinib and the 
second is weekl y MTX.
Upadacitinib (or matching placebo) stud y drug will be taken orall y once daily , beginning 
on Day  1 (Baseline), and should be taken at approximately  the same time each day .  The 
study  drug can be taken with or without food. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
102
MTX (or matching placebo) study  drug will be taken orall y once weekl y, beginning on 
Day 1 (Baseline), and should be taken the same day  and approximately the same time 
each week.  The study  drug can be taken with or without food.
Each subject will be instructed to take 2 capsules once weekl y (MTX and/or matching 
placebo) and 1 tablet once daily (upadacitinib or matching placebo) to maintain blinding.  
MTX and matching placebo will be assigned via the Interactive Response Technology  
(IRT) sy stem, and distributed as identical capsules in blister packs, to provide the correct 
total dose for each individual subject and to maintain blinding during and after MTX 
titration (Period 1 and Period 2).  Detail ed dosing instructions can be found in the Subject 
Dosing Diary  and Instructions.   Starting with Amendment 6 subjects receiving MTX will 
receive open- label MTX tablets in quantities sufficient to cover their respective dose.
Subjects should take a dietary  supplement of oral folic acid beginning on Day  1 (Baseline) 
throughout stud y participation.  Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be 
followed according to the Investigator 's instructions.
When the last subject completes the Week 24 Visit of Period 1, the study  conduct of 
Period 1 may  be unblinded only  to the sponsor for anal ysis.  Subjects and sites will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment throughout Period 1.  When the last subject 
completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 48), study  drug assignment in both periods may  
be unblinded to the Sponsor and sites, and subjects would then be dispensed study drug in 
an open -label fashion until the completion of Period 2.  All subjects will continue study  
treatment to which they  were assigned at th e time of study  unblinding.  Dose changes of 
open -label stud y drugs are not permitted during unblinded Period 2.  Background 
therapies may  be adjusted as per the discretion of the investigator.   
Starting with 
Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will receive open-
label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Starting with Amendment 6 subjects receiving MTX will 
receive open- label MTX.
If a subject is unable to come to the study  site to pick up their study  drug due to state of

Subjects should take study drug as outlined in Section 5.5.1.
On dosing day s that occur on study  visit day s, subjects should follow the regular dosing 
schedule (refer to Section 5.3.2.1 regarding Week 2 and Week 4 Visits).
Each subject 's dosing schedule should be closel y monitored by  the site at each study  visit 
by careful review of the subject 's dosing diary .  This will ensure that all subjects enrolled 
into the study  maintain their original dosing schedule beginning with the first dose of 
study  drug (Baseline/Day 1).

Upadacitinib/Placebo tablets (daily  dosing):
●If a subjec t should forget to take his/her dail y upadacitinib (or matching 
placebo) dose at his/her regularl y scheduled dosing time, he/she should take 
the forgotten dose as soon as they remember the dose was missed as long as it 
is at least 10 hours before his/her n ext scheduled dose.  If a subject only  
remembers the missed dose within 10 hours before next scheduled dose, the 
subject should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the scheduled 
time.
●If the subject experiences a study drug interruption > 14 con secutive day s 
during Period 1 or > 30 day s during Period 2 (other than for reasons listed in 
Section 6.1.7), he/she should notify  the Investigator, and the Investigator will 
determine if stud y drug should be restarted .  If study  drug treatment is 
interrupted or withdrawn in Periods 1 or 2, both daily  and weekl y stud y drug 
administration must be stopped.  Period 2 may  be unblinded after all subjects 
complete Period 1, at which time daily  and weekly  study  drugs can be 
individually  interrupted.
MTX/Placebo capsules or tablets (weekly  dosing):
●Weekly  MTX (or matching placebo) should be taken the same day  and 
approximately  the same time each week.  If the subject should forget to take 
his/her oral MTX (or matching placebo) dose on his/her regularl y scheduled 
dosing date, he/she should take the forgotten dose as soon as he/she 
remembers.  If more than 72 hours has elapsed since the missed dose, the 
subject s hould contact the Investigator for further dosing instructions.  The 
study  drug can be taken with or without food.
●If the subject experiences a study  drug interruption ≥ 3 consecutive missed 
doses in Period 1 or 2 (other than for reasons listed in Section 6.1.7), he/she 
should notify  the Investigator, and the Investigator will determine if stud y drug 
should be restarted.  If study  drug treatment is i nterrupted or withdrawn in 
Periods 1 or 2, both daily and weekl y stud y drug administration must be 
stopped.  Period 2 may  be unblinded after all subjects complete Period 1, at 
which time daily  and weekly  study  drugs can be individually  interrupted.

5.5.5 Blindi ng
5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of AbbVie Drug Supply  Management Team), the Investigator, study  site 
personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject 's treatment throughout 
Period 1.
In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib and placebo tablets along with MTX and 
placebo capsules provided for the stud y will be identical in appearance.  The I RT will 
provide access to unblinded subjec t treatment information in the case of medical 
emergency .
In the event of a medical situation that requires unblinding of the stud y drug assignment, 
the Investigator is requested to contact the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director 
prior to breaking the blind.  However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary  
which warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting the AbbVie Therapeutic Area 
Medical Director, the Investigator can directl y access the I RT sy stem to break the blind 
without AbbVie n otification or agreement.  Unblinding is available in the IRT sy stem via 
the Unblind Subject transaction, which is available only to the Investigator.  If the IRT 
system is unavailable, unblinding may  occur b y contacting EndPoint technical support via 
either phone (preferred) or email (support@endpointclinical.com).  For country -specific 
phone numbers, please see the following website:  http://www.endpointclinical.com/help-
desk/.  I n the event that the blind is broken before notification to the AbbVie Thera peutic 
Area Medical Director, we request that the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director be 
notified within 24 hours of the blind being broken.  The date and reason that the blind was 
broken must be convey ed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
When the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 48), stud y drug 
assignment in both periods may  be unblinded to the Sponsor and sites, and subjects would 
then be dispensed stud y drug in an open -label fashion until the completion of Perio d 2.

5.5.5.2 Blinding of Data for Data Monitoring Committee
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised of persons independent of 
AbbVie and with relevant expertise in their field will review unblinded safety data from 
the ongoing stud y.  The primary responsibility  of the DMC will be to protect the safet y of 
the subjects participating in this study .
A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the 
roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency  of data revi ews, and relevant 
safet y data to be assessed.
Communications from the DMC to the Study  Teams will not contain information that 
could potentially  unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.
As of September 2018, with all subjects having reached the end of Period 1, and after 
final review of unblinded safety data, the DMC concluded its oversight of this study .
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study  in accordance with 
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary.  Subjects will be instructed to 
return all drug contai ners (even if empty ) to the study  site personnel at each clinic visit.  
The study  site personnel will document compliance in the study  source documents.
5.5.7 Drug A ccountability
The Investigator or his/her representative will verify that stud y drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by signing and dating the 
Proof of Receipt or similar document and b y registering the arrival of drug through the  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
109
IRT.  The original Proof of Receipt Note and the IRT confirmation sheet will be kept in 
the site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, an I RT will be used to document investigational product accountability  
including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, 
subject number, and the identification of the person dispensing the drug.
All empty /used study  drug packaging will be inventoried by  the site.  Empty /used study  
drug packaging should be returned b y the subject at each visit for accountability  and 
compliance purposes and n ew packaging issued as necessary .  Site staff will complete 
study  drug accountabilit y via I RT by  using source documents, subject dosing diaries, and 
by visually inspecting the packaging whenever possible.  After drug accountability  and 
monitor reconciliati on has been completed, used packaging and unused study  drug will be 
destroy ed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the 
destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet AbbVie 's documentation requirements 
for on -site destru ction).  The use of a third -party vendor for drug destruction must be pre -
approved b y AbbVie.  For sites performing on -site drug destruction or using a third -party 
vendor for drug destruction, a cop y of the destruction methodology and date of 
destruction s hould be maintained at the site 's facility .
Site monitors will reconcile the site 's processes, source documents, subject 's dosing 
diaries, IRT or site accountability  records, and destruction records to assure site 
compliance.
5.6 Discussion and Justification o f Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
This multicenter study  includes two periods.  
Period 1 is a 48- week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, active 
comparator -controlled treatment period designed to compare the safe ty and efficacy  of 
upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD monotherap y (for subjects in Japan only), 15 mg QD  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
110
monotherap y, and 30 mg QD monotherap y versus MTX monotherap y in adult MTX -
naïve subjects with moderatel y to severel y active RA.  Period 1 is also designed to 
compa re the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy  and 30 mg QD 
monotherap y versus MTX monotherapy for the prevention of structural progression.  
Period 1 is designed to test superiority of upadacitinib versus MTX for achieving the 
primary  endpoint (the proportion of subjects achieving ACR50 response [US/FDA 
regulatory  purposes] or the proportion of subjects achieving CR [EU/EMA regulatory  
purposes] or ACR20 and change from baseline in mTSS [Japan/PMDA regulatory  
purposes]) at Week 24, and other secondary efficacy  parameters.
The purpose of Period 2 is to evaluate the long -term safet y, tolerability, and efficacy of 
upadacitinib (7.5, 15, or 30 mg QD) in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.  
All subjects will continue treatment to which they were a ssigned at the end of Period 1 in 
a blinded manner.  This will allow unbiased assessments of long -term safety  of 
upadacitinib without compromising the study conduct or results of ongoing Period 1.  
Dose reduction or escalation of upadacitinib during Period 2 is not permitted to allow 
unbiased assessments of long -term safet y and efficacy  of upadacitinib 30 mg QD versus 
15 mg QD.
When the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 48), stud y drug 
assignment in both periods may  be unblinded to the Sponsor and sites, and subjects would 
then be dispensed stud y drug in an open -label fashion until the completion of Period 2.
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will 
receive open- label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Starting with Amendment 6 subjects 
receiving MTX will receive open- label MTX.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory  procedures will be utilized in this study .  All 
efficacy  measurements in this study  are standard for a ssessing disease activity  in subjects  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
111
with RA.  All clinical and laboratory  procedures in this study  are standard and generally  
accepted.
5.6.3 Suitability  of Subject Population
The intended stud y population is moderately to severel y active RA patients who are n aïve 
to MTX treatment.  Key  entry  criteria are to enroll adult female and male subjects who are 
at least 18 y ears of age with sy mptoms consistent with RA for ≥ 6 weeks who also fulfill 
the 2010 ACR/EUL AR classification criteria for RA and no prior or limit ed MTX 
treatment.  Eligible stud y subjects must have ≥ 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) 
and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and 
hsCRP ≥5 mg/L  (central lab, ULN 2.87 mg/L) at Screening.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
Three doses of the once -daily  formulation of upadacitinib will be evaluated:  upadacitinib 
7.5mg QD (subjects in Japan onl y), 15 mg QD, and 30 mg QD.  The dose selection in 
this study  is based on extrapolation of pre -clinical efficacy  models and analy ses of PK, 
pharmacod ynamic, safety, and efficacy data from the Phase 1 studies in healthy 
volunteers (single and multiple ascending dose Studies M13- 401 and M13 -845, 
respectivel y) and Phase 2 studies in RA subjects (Studies M13 -537 and M13 -550).  The 
doses selected for Study  M13 -545, upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD (for subjects in Japan only ), 
15mg QD, and 30 mg QD, dosed up to 2 60 weeks, are expected to be efficacious with an 
acceptable safet y profile.
Preliminary  results from an ongoing relative bioavailability  study  demonstrated that single 
15 mg and 30 mg doses of the once -daily formulation provide comparable AUC and 
significantl y lower C maxthan single doses of 12 mg immediate release formulation (AUC 
equivalent to 6 mg BID dose tested in Phase 2) and 24 mg immediate release formulation 
(AUC equivalent to 12 mg BID dose tested in Phase 2), respectivel y, under fasting 
conditions.  At steady -state, the once -daily  dose of 15 mg QD is predicted to achieve 
comparable daily  AUC and C max, and non -infer ior C trough to 6 mg BID immediate release 
formulation.  I n the Phase 2 studies, the 6 mg BID dose was shown to achieve near  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
112
maximum efficacy .  The once -daily dose of 30 mg QD is predicted to achieve comparable 
daily  AUC and C max, and non -inferior C trough to 12 mg BID immediate release formulation.  
In the Phase 2 studies, the 12 mg BID dose was clearl y shown to achieve the plateau of 
efficacy .

6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a 
causal relationshi p with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
the event is cons idered causally  related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in 
severit y of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and 
changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only  if they  result in discontinuation from 
study  drug, necessi tate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator 
considers them to be AEs.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during the study  will not be considered 
an AE if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condit ion and the 
surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the pre -existing 
condition deteriorates unexpectedly  during the study  (e.g., surgery  performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which th e elective surgery /procedure 
is being done will be considered an AE.
6.1.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE.
Death of S ubject An event that results in the death of a subject. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
114
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality  if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would ha ve 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for an y 
length of time or prolongs the subject 's hospital stay .  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
result in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that sub stantially  
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly , or persistent or significa nt disability /incapacity ).  
Additionally , any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at 
home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse.
For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form.

event to the use of stud y drug: 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
116
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality  assessments, events ass essed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated. "  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated. "  
In addition, when the Inv estigator has not reported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator 's opinion of no reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by th e investigator for the Serious 
Adverse Event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 day s following 
discontinuation of study  drug administration have elapsed will be collected, whether 
solicited or spontaneously reported b y the subject.  Subjects who discontinue study drug 
treatment but continue to participate in the stud y will have SAEs and nonserious AEs 
collected for the remainder of study participation.  I n addition, SAEs and protocol -related
nonserious AEs will be collected from the time the subject signed the study -specific 
informed consent.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 5.

for upadacitinib and/or the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for MTX, as 
applicable .
In Japan, the Principal Investigator will provide documentation of all SAEs to the Director 
of the investigative site and the Sponsor.
6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after the site 
becomes aware of the p regnancy .  Subjects who become pregnant during the study  must 
be discontinued from study  drug (Section 5.4.1 ).
Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy  will be collected.  Pregnancies in study  subjects will be collected from the date 
of the first dose through 180 days following the last dose of study drug.
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not cons idered an AE.  However, the medical outcome of 
an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomal y is considered an 
SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the 
event.
Subjects and partners of subjects receiving MTX should avoid pregnancy throughout the 
course of the stud y, starting with the Screening Visit through 180 days after the last study 
drug administration for female subjects and male subjects receiving MTX.  Mal e subjects 
receiving MTX should also refrain from donating sperm for up to 180 days post last dose 
of study  drug.  Results of a positive pregnancy  test or confirmation of a pregnancy  will be 
assessed starting with the Screening Visit through the final stud y visit.  
6.1.7 Toxicity  Management
The toxicity  management of the AEs including AEs of special interest consists of safet y 
monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safet y 
issues by  a safet y data monitoring committee), inte rruption of stud y drug dosing with 
appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
121
the study  drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory  parameters is described 
below.
For subjects who discontinued study  drug, but continued study  participation and are 
instead on standard of care therapies, these toxicity management requirements do not 
apply  (including alerts from the central lab) and any  intolerabilit y to standard of care 
therapies should be managed b y the pr escribing phy sician.
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and sy mptoms of infection during and after treatment with study  drug.  Study  drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.  A 
subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study  drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As 
appropriate, antimicrobial therap y should be initiated, and the subject should be closel y 
monitored.  Re -challenge with study  drug may  occur once the infection has been 
successfull y treated.  Subjects who develop active TB must be discontinued from study 
drug.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study  drug in subjects with a confirm ed diagnosis of COVID -19.  
Consider interrupting study  drug in subjects with signs and/or s ymptoms and suspicion of 
COVID- 19.  The COVID -19 eCRF must be completed.
Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporaril y interrupting 
study  drug until the episode resolves.
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   If a diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed 
(other than appendicitis or penetrating injury), the subject must be permanently  
discontinued from study  drug.
Cardiovascular Events (MACE):   Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular 
events should be carefully monitored.  These events will be reviewed and adjudicated b y 
an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded manner. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
122
Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop s ymptoms of thrombosis should be promptly  
evaluated and treated appropriatel y.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolus or non- cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must
be discontinued from study  drug.
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ 
of the cervix must be discontinued from study drug.  Information including 
histopathologi cal results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic 
skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
ECG Abnormality:   Subjects must be discontinued from study  drug for an ECG change 
conside red clinically  significant and with reasonable possibility  of relationship to study  
drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > 500 msec.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:  For an y given laboratory 
abnormality , the Investigator should assess the subject, appl y the standard of care for 
medical evaluation and treatment following an y local guidelines.  Specific toxicity  
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory  values are described in Table 4, and may

Hemoglobin  If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing 
with new sample.
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline without an alternative etiology, 
interrupt study dosing and confirm by repeat testing with new sample.
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline and an alternative etiology is 
known, the subject may remain on study drug at the investigator 's discretion. 
 If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value returns to 
normal reference range or its baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) If confirmed < 1000 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its baseline 
value.
 Discontinue study drug if confirmed < 500 cells/µL by repeat testing with new 
sample.
Absolute lymphocyte 
counts (ALC) If confirmed < 500 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study drug 
dosing until ALC returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
Total white blood cell 
count  If confirmed < 2000 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until white blood cell cou nt returns to normal reference range or its 
baseline value.
Platelet count  If confirmed < 50,000 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until platelet count returns to normal reference range or its baseline

Laboratory Values (Continued)
Laboratory Parameter Toxicity Management Guideline
AST or ALT  Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by repe at 
testing with new sample and either a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or an international 
normalized ratio > 1.5.
o A separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure INR at the 
time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.  A repeat test of INR is not n eeded for 
determination if above toxicity management criteria are met. 
 Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by repeat 
testing with new sample along with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).
 Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 5 × ULN by repeat 
testing with new sample for more than 2 weeks. 
 If ALT or AST > 8 × ULN, interrupt study drug immediately, confirm by repeat 
testing with new sample, and contact the TA MD.
Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an alternative 
etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically appropriate.  If 
applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented in the eCRF.  If ALT or AST 
values return to the normal reference range or its Baseline value, study drug may be 
restarted.  If restarting study drug, documentation should include reason that rechallenge 
is expected to be safe.  If after clinica lly appropriate evaluation, no alternative etiology 
for ALT or AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not resolved or is 
not trending down toward normal, the subject should be discontinued from study drug.
For any confirmed ALT or AST eleva tions > 3 ULN, complete supplemental hepatic 
eCRF.
 Subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA at 
screening who develop the following should have HBV DNA by PCR testing 
performed within 1 week:
o ALT > 5 × ULN OR
o ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily identified
o A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the 
time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing in these subjects will require 
immediate interr uption of study drug and a hepatologist consultation should occur 
within 1 week for recommendation regarding subsequent treatment.
Serum Creatinine  If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test for 
serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results.  If the 
results of the repeat testing still meet this criterion, then interrupt study drug and re -
start study drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × baseline value and ≤ ULN.
 If confirmed serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL, interrupt study drug and re -start study 
drug once serum creatinine returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
For the above serum creatinine elevation scenarios, complete supplemental renal eCRF.

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and A nalytical P lans
A global anal ysis will be conducted for the comparisons of upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 
30mg QD treatment groups versus the MTX treatment group for all subjects (excluding 
the Japan specific upadacitinib 7.5 mg treatment group).  A separate Japan sub -study 
analysis will be conducted for the comparisons of upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg QD, 
and 30 mg QD treatment groups versus the MTX treatment group for subjects enrolled in 
Japan only .
An unblinded anal ysis will be conducted after all subjects have comple ted Week 24 for 
the purpose of regulatory submission.  To maintain integrit y of the trial and avoid 
introduction of bias, study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of 
Period 1.  Additional unblinded anal yses may  be conducted after the W eek 24 anal ysis.
Completed and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully 
documented in the Statistical Anal ysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the 
database lock for the primary anal ysis at Week 24.  The stati stical anal yses will be 
performed using SAS (SAS I nstitute Inc., Cary , NC, USA).
Starting with Amendment 6, subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD will 
receive open- label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Starting with Amendment 6 subjects 
receiving MTX will receive open- label MTX. The details for handling the change in dose 
in analy sis will be described in the Statistical Analy sisPlan (S AP) for final reporting.

8.1.4 Efficacy  Analysis
All efficacy  analy ses will be carried out using the FAS population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
8.1.4.1 Efficacy  Analysis for Period 1
8.1.4.1.1 Primary  Efficacy  Variables
The primary  endpoints for US/FDA, EU/EMA, and Japan/PMDA regulatory  purposes are 
listed in Section 5.3.3.1.1 .  Analy ses will be conducted separatel y for US/FDA, EU/EMA 
and Japan/PMDA regulatory  purposes; for each set of anal yses, onl y the specified primary 
endpoint is applicable.
The anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be conducted on the FAS based on 
treatment as randomized.  Supportive analysis will also be conducted on the Per Protocol 
Analy sis Set.  For the analy sis of ACR20, ACR50 and CR, the comparisons will be made 
between each upadacitinib dose and the MTX group using the Cochran -Mantel- Haens zel 
test adjusting for main stratification factors.  Non -Responder Imputation (NRI ) will be 
used as the primary  anal ysis.  For the analysis of change from baseline in mTSS, between -
group comparisons for each upadacitinib treatment group and the MTX treatme nt group 
will be performed using the anal ysis of covariance model with treatment group as the 
fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the 
covariates.  Both linear extrapolation analy sis and as observed anal ysis will be conducted.
The primary  efficacy  analyses will be performed in demographic subgroups including age, 
gender, weight, bod y mass index, race, and geographical region to assess the consistency 
of the treatment effect.  Additional subgroup analyses based on baseline disease 
characteristics and stratification factors will also be conducted.
8.1.4.1.2 Key Secondary  Efficacy  Variables
Key secondary  endpoints for US/FDA, EU/EMA, and Japan/PMDA regulatory  purposes 
regulatory  purposes are listed in Section 5.3.3.1.2 . 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
133
For binary  endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment 
group.  Similar analy ses as for the primary  endpoi nt will be conducted.
For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be 
reported for each treatment group.  Between -group comparisons for each upadacitinib 
treatment group and the MTX treatment group will be performed using the anal ysis of 
covariance model with treatment groups as the fixed factor, and the corresponding 
baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates.
See Section 8.1.4.1.5 for imputation methods.
8.1.4.1.3 Other Efficacy  Variables 
Additional efficacy  variables are listed in Section 5.3.3.1.3 and will be summarized for all 
visits, including visits beyond Week 24.  For binary endpoints, frequencies and 
percentages will be reported for each treatment group.  For continuous endpoints, the 
change from baseline mean, standard deviation, media n, and range will be reported for 
each treatment group.
8.1.4.1.4 Multiplicity  Control for the Primary  and Ranked Key  
Secondary  Endpoints
For the global anal ysis of upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD compared to MTX 
(excluding the Japan specific upadacitinib 7.5 mg treatment group), the overall type I 
error rate of the primary  and ranked key  secondary  endpoints for the two doses will be 
strongl y controlled using a graphical multiple testing procedure.23  Specifically , the testing 
will utilize the endpoint sequence of primary  endpoint(s) followed by  the ranked key  
secondary  endpoints in the order as specified in Section 5.3.3.1.2, and will begin with 
testing the primary  endpoint using α of 0.025 for each dose.  Continued testing will follow 
a pre -specified α tran
sfer path which includes downstream transfer along the endpoint 
sequence within each dose as well as cross -dose transfer.  More details of the graphical 
procedure will be specified in the SAP.

134
8.1.4.1.5 Imputation Methods
The following methods will be used for missi ng data imputation:
Observed Cases (OC):   The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, 
and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded 
from the OC anal ysis for that visit.
Multiple Imputation (MI):  The M I anal ysis imputes missing data multiple times under 
appropriate random variation and thus generate multiple im puted "pseudo -complete "
datasets.  Results will be aggregated across the multiple imputed datasets, overcoming 
drawbacks of the single imputation methods .
Non- Responder Imputation (NRI):   NRI applies to binary  endpoints only.  I n NRI 
analysis, subjects who prematurel y discontinue study drug will be considered 
non-responders after discontinuation.
Linear Extrapolation for Radiographic Data:   For radiographic data (i.e., mTSS -based 
endpoints), if a subject receives rescue therap y or prematurel y discontinued, the 
radiographic data at time points after rescue or discontinuation will be imputed assuming 
a linear relationsh ip between baseline and previous time point when X -ray should be 
collected. 
For non -radiographic data, the NRI approach will serve as the primary  analy sis approach 
for key  binary  endpoints.  The MI approach will serve as the primary  anal ysis approach 
for key continuous endpoints.  Sensitivity  anal ysis based on OC will also be conducted for 
key endpoints.  For radiographic data, anal ysis based on both linear extrapolation and an 
as-observed anal ysis (where the as -observed Week 24/48 assessments for all subj ects are 
used) will be conducted.
8.1.4.2 Long- Term Efficacy  for Period 1 and Period 2 Combined
The efficacy  endpoints of long -term efficacy  analy sis are listed in Section 5.3.3.2 and will 
be summarized for all visits. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
135
Long -term efficacy  by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  For 
binary  endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be summarized.   For continuous 
endpoints, the mean and standard deviation will be reported.
8.1.5 Safety  Analysis
8.1.5.1 General Considerations
Safety  anal yses will be carried out using the Safety  Analy sis Set.  Anal yses will be 
conducted for Period 1 alone, as well as for Period 1 and Period 2 combined.
Safety  analyses are based on treatments actuall y received.  Safet y will be assessed by  AEs, 
physical examination, laboratory  assessments, ECG, and vital signs.  Frequency  tables 
and lists of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs by  preferred term as in the Medical 
Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) dictionary , by system organ class, by  
severit y, and b y relationship to the study  drug as assessed by  the Investigator will be 
provided.  The changes from baseline in vital signs, phy sical examination results, and 
clinical laboratory values will be anal yzed in a descriptive manner.  Shift of laboratory  
values from baseline to defined time points will be tabulated.
Missing safet y data will not be imputed.
8.1.5.2 Analysis of Adverse Events
Unless otherwise specified, the following conventions apply for both the Period 1 safet y 
analysis and the combined safet y analysis of Period 1 and Period 2.
8.1.5.2.1 Treatment -Emergent A dverse Events (TE AE)
AEs will be coded using MedDRA.  A TEAE is defined as AE that began or worsened in 
severit y after initiation of study drug.
AEs starting more than 30 day s following the last dose of study  drug will not be included 
in summaries of TEAEs.  For subjects who continued into Period 2, AEs that are reported 
in Period 2 w ill be summarized in the combined safety anal ysis of Period 1 and Period 2. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
136
As a general safet y summary, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs 
will be summarized for each treatment group for the following AE categories:
●All AEs;
●All seve re AEs;
●All reasonabl y possibly related AEs;
●All SAEs;
●Frequent AEs (reported in 2% of subjects or more in any  treatment group);
●Frequent reasonabl y possibly  related AEs (reported in 5% of subjects or more 
in any  treatment group);
●Discontinuations due to A Es;
●Death.
Additional AEs may be considered for tabulation/summary based on recommendations 
from Clinical and Safet y as deemed appropriate.
TEAEs will be summarized and presented b y system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred 
terms (PTs) using MedDRA.  The SOCs will be presented in alphabetical order, and the 
PTs will be presented in alphabetical order within each SOC.
TEAE will also be summarized by  maximum severity  and b y maximum relationship.
The AEs of special interest (including but not limited to serio us infection, opportunistic 
infection, herpes zoster, TB, gastrointestinal perforations, malignancies, MACE, renal 
dysfunction, anemia, increased CPK, drug -related hepatic disorders, and embolic and 
thrombotic events (non- cardiac, non -CNS)) will be summari zed.  Event rate (per 
100patient y ears) for AEs of special interest will also be summarized for the combined 
safet y analysis of Period 1 and Period 2.
All AEs leading to discontinuation of study  drug will be presented in listing format.  A 
listing by  treatment group of TEAEs grouped b y SOC and MedDRA preferred term with 
subject identification numbers will be generated.

8.1.5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events and Death
All treatment -emergent SAEs and AEs leading to death will also be presented in listing 
format.  In addition, SAEs will be summarized by  SOC and MedDRA PT.
8.1.5.3 Analysis of Laboratory , Vital Sign, and ECG Data
Changes from baseline by visit, and changes from baseline to minimum value, maximum 
value, and final values in continuous laboratory  data, and vital si gns will be summarized 
by treatment group.
Baseline values are defined as the last non -missing measurements recorded on or before 
the date of the first dose of study  drug in Period 1.
The laboratory data will be categorized as Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 
according to OMERACT criteria (Rheumatology  Common Toxicity  Criteria v.2.0).  For 
creatine phosphokinase, and serum creatinine, NCI CTC criteria will be used.  The shift 
tables will tabulate the number and percentage of subjects with baseline and post-baseline 
values by  grade level.
Listings will be provided for potentially  clinically  significant laboratory  values and vital 
signs.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure -Response A nalyses
Individual upadacitinib plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and 
summarized with appropriate statistical methods.
Data from this study  may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK 
and exposure -response analy ses.  Population PK and exposure -response analy ses of onl y 
data from this s tudy may  not be conducted.  The following general methodology  will be 
used for the population PK and exposure -response anal yses.
Population PK analy ses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to 
dosing.  PK models will be built using a no n-linear mixed -effects modeling approach with  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
138
NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version).  The structure of the starting PK 
model will be based on the PK anal ysis of data from previous studies.  The CL /F and V/F 
of upadacitinib will be the PK paramet ers of major interest in the anal yses.  If necessary, 
other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be 
fixed if useful in the analysis.
The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of 
different models.
1. The objective function of the best model is significantly  smaller than the alternative 
model(s).
2. The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more 
randomly  distributed across the line of unity  (a straight line with zero intercept and 
a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
3. Visual inspection of model fits standard errors of model parameters and change in 
inter-subject and intra -subject error.
Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter -and intra -subject error structure) is 
developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be 
calculated b y the posterior conditional estimation technique using non -linear 
mixed -effects modeling.  The relationship between these conditional est imates CL /F and 
V/F values with onl y potentially ph ysiologicall y relevant or clinically meaningful 
covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory 
markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using ste pwise forward 
selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level 
of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of 
covariates from the full model will be employ ed to evaluat e the significance (at P < 0.005, 
corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of 
each covariate in the full model. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
139
Linear or non -linear relationships of primary  PK parameters with various covariates will 
be explored.
Relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy 
variable) will be explored.  Exposure -response relationships for secondary  efficacy  
variables and/or some safety  measures of interest may  also be explored.  The relati onship 
between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area 
under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model- predicted PK profiles, or 
some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored.  Several 
classes of models (e.g., linear, log -linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be 
evaluated to characterize the exposure -response relationship based on observed data.  
Results of the PK and exposure -response analy ses may  be summarized in a separate report 
prior to regulatory  filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of RA, rather than in the CSR.
Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The planned sample size of 900 (not including the Ja pan specific upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD 
treatment group) provides at least 90% power for a 20% difference in ACR50 response 
rate (assuming a Week 12 MTX ACR50 rate of 20%).  This sample size also provides at 
least 90% power for a 16% difference in DAS28 CR response rate (assuming a Week 24 
MTX CR rate of 24%), and for a 20% difference in ACR20 response rate (assuming a 
Week 12 MTX ACR20 rate of 50%).  With this sample size, there is approximately  80% 
power to detect a difference of 0.58 in change from baseline in mTSS (assuming a 
standard deviation of 2.2).  This sample size will also provide at least 90% power for 
other ranked key  secondary  endpoints including change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP), 
change from baseline in HAQ- DI, ACR70, and SF -36.  The above powe r calculations are 
all based on a two -sided significance level of 0.025 and accounting for a 10% dropout rate.  
An additional 75 Japanese subjects will be enrolled into the Japan specific upadacitinib 
7.5 mg QD treatment arm for Japan/PMDA regulatory  purpo ses.

Randomization will be stratified b y geographic region.
See Section 5.5.3 for details.
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
Investigator 's Brochure, the informed consent, and all other forms of subject information 
related to the stud y (e.g ., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and an y other necessary 
documents be reviewed by an IEC/I RB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific 
and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the 
protocol, informed consent, and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will 
be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB approval prior to implementation 
of an y changes made to the study  design.  The investigator will be required to submit,  
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
141
maintain and archive study  essential documents according to International Conference on 
Harmonization (I CH) GCP.
Any SAEs that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by  local regulations, will be 
reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required b y 
local regulations.  During the conduct of the stud y, the I nvestigator should promptly  
provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and an y additional r eports required 
by local regulations) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect the conduct of the study  
and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH guidelines, applicable 
regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities o f the clinical 
investigator are specified in Appendix A.
In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epidemic/pandemic, natural disaster, 
conflict/combat) occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified procedures, 
AbbVie may  engage with study  site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, 
maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrit y of the stud y while 
trying to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative methods for 
assessments (e.g., virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use of a 
local lab instead of a central lab), and shipping investigational product and/or supplies 
direct to subjects to ensure continuity  of treatment where allowed.  In all cases, these 
alternative measures must be allowed b y local regulations and permitted by I RB/IEC.  
Investigators should notify AbbVie if an y urgent safet y measures are taken to protect the 
subjects against an y immediate hazard.

9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to an y stud y-related 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A cop y of 
the informed consent will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject' s medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject 's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtaine d prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participati on 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent.
Samples for exploratory  research/validation studies will only  be collected if the subject 
has voluntarily  signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory 
research/validation studies, approved b y an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has 
been explained and the subject has had an opportunity  to ask questions.  The separate 
written consent must be signed before the exploratory research/validation studies samples 
are collected and testing is performed.  The separate written consent may  be part of the 
main consent form.  If the subject does not consent to the exploratory research/validation 
studies, it will not impact the subject' s participation in the study .
In the event a subject withdraw s from the main study , optional exploratory  research 
samples will continue to be stored and anal yzed unless the subject specifically  withdraws 
consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the 
subject must inform the ir study  doctor, and once AbbVie is informed, the optional 
samples will be destro yed.  However, if the subject withdraws his/her consent and the 
samples have alread y been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall 
research data.

Due to a pandemic situation like COVID -19 or state of emergency , it is possible that 
additional protocol modifications not outlined in this protocol may become necessary.  If 
this situation arises, in addition to the study  informed consent, additional verbal cons ent 
may be obtained prior to these adaptations or substantial changes in stud y conduct in 
accordance with local regulations.
9.3.1 Informed Consent Form and Explanatory  Material
In Japan, the Principal Investigator will prepare the informed consent and explanato ry 
material required to obtain subject' s consent to participate in the study  with the 
cooperation of the sponsor and will revise these documents as required.  The prepared or 
revised consent forms and explanatory  material will be submitted to the sponsor. 
Approval of the IRB will be obtained prior to use in the study.
9.3.2 Revision of the Consent Form and Explanatory  Material
In Japan, when important new information related to the subject' s consent becomes 
available, the Principal Investigator will revise the informed consent and explanatory  
material based on the information without delay  and will obtain the approval of the IRB 
prior to use in the study .  The Investigator will provide the information, without delay, to 
each subject alread y participating in the study , and will confirm the intention of each 
subject to continue the study  or not.  The Investigator shall also provide a further 
explanation using the revised form and explanatory material and shall obtain written 
consent from each subject of their own f ree will to continue participating in the study .

11.0 Data Quality  Assurance
Prior to the initiation of the study, a meeting may be held with Ab bVie personnel, the 
investigators and appropriate site personnel.  This meeting may include a detailed 
discussion of the protocol, performance of stud y procedures, CRF, subject dosing diary , 
and specimen collection methods.  Another alternative of site tra ining may include 
module training via a study  portal.  
The AbbVie monitor will monitor each site throughout the study .  Source document 
review will be performed against entries on the CRF and a quality  assurance check will be 
performed to ensure that the Investigator is comply ing with the protocol and regulations.
Data hand entered in the database will be verified at AbbVie.  An y discrepancies will be 
reviewed against the CRF and corrected on -line.  After completion of the entry  process, 
computer logic and manual checks will be created by  AbbVie to identify  items such as 
inconsistent study  dates.  Any  necessary  corrections will be made by  the site to the eCRF.
Routine hematology, serum chemistry  and serology , and urinal ysis, and other tests such as 
rheumatoid factor, anti -CCP, and HBV/HCV testing, will be conducted using a central 
laboratory  (refer to Appendix Dand Appendix F).  The data from these analy ses will be 
electronically  transferred from the central laboratory  to the study  database.
Laboratory  tests including, but not limited to, urine pregnancy  testing and ESR, will be 
conducted locally  by each study  site (refer to Appendix Dand Appendix F).  Sites will 
provide AbbVie with laboratory  certifications and normal ranges for each local laboratory  
used.  The full name, address, phone number and fax number for each local laborat ory

Section 5.2.1 Inclusion Criteria
10. If female of childbearing potential, subject must be practicing two forms of 
contraception (one highly  effective m ethod combined with one effective method, 
refer to Contraception Recommendations for Females below) that are effective 
from Study  Day  1 through at least 180 day s after the last dose of stud y drug.
11. Male subjects who are sexually  active with female partner(s ) of childbearing 
potential must agree from Study  Day  1 through 180 days after the last dose of study  
drug to practice the protocol -specified contraception (refer to Contraception 
Recommendations for Males below ).
Section 5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilat eral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more m onths without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.   
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
157
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified cont raception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.  
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required and a serum pregn ancy  test must be performed (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 m onths are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to use two forms of 
contraception.  This includes one form of highl y effective contraception and one effective 
method of contraception that are effective from Study  Day 1 (or earlier) through at least 
180 day s after the last dose of study  drug.
●Highl y effective methods:
○Hormonal contraceptives started at least 2 months prior to randomization 
(e.g., combined [estr ogen and progestogen containing] oral contraceptives, 
patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants);
○Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine s ystem (IUS);
○Vasectom y and tubal ligation.
●Effective methods: 
○Barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male condom, female condom, 
cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge). 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8
EudraCT 2015 -003334 -27
158
○Note:  The proper use of diaphragm or cervical cap includes use of 
spermicide and is considered one barrier method.  The cervical cap and 
contraceptive sponge are less effective in parous women.  The use of 
spermicide alone is not considered a suitable barrier method for 
contraception.  When used consistently  and correctly , "double barrier "
methods of contraception (e.g., male condom with diaphragm, male 
condom with cervical cap) can be us ed as an effective alternative to the 
highl y effective contraception methods described above.  Male and female 
condoms should not be used together as they can tear of become damaged.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requir ements for male subjects receiving upadacitinib only , or 
their female partner(s).  
For a male subject receiving MTX who has a female partner who is postmenopausal or 
permanentl y sterile, no contraception is required.
A male subject receiving MTX who is se xually  active with female partner(s) of 
childbearing potential must agree from Study  Day  1 through 180 day s after the last dose 
of MTX study  drug to practice contraception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the highly  effective 
contraceptive methods as defined in the protocol for female stud y subjects of 
childbearing potential .
Additionally , male subjects receiving MTX must agree not to donate sperm from Study  
Day 1 through 180 day s after the last dose of MTX study  drug. 
Male subjects receiving MTX are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of 
becoming pregnant and for reporting an y pregnancy  to the study  doctor.

Section 5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing pote ntial and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.
Postmenopausal is defined as:

medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alt ernative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least 180 days after the last dose of study drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Stud y Day 1. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -545 Protocol Amendment 8

●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received 
medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of 
the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine d evice (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
A second form of contraception (barrier) such as a male or female condom with or 
without spermicide OR cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in 
addition to one of the highly  effec tive birth control methods listed above.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for male subjects receiving upadacitinib only , or 
their female partner(s).  
For a male subject receiving MTX who has a female partner w ho is postmenopausal or 
permanentl y sterile, no contraception is required.
A male subject receiving MTX who is sexually  active with female partner(s) of 
childbearing potential must agree from Study  Day  1 through 180 day s after the last dose 
of MTX study  drug to practice contraception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the contraceptive 
measures (as defined in the protocol for female study subjects of childbearing 
potential).
Additionally , male subjects receiving MTX must agree not to donate sperm from Study  
Day 1 through 180 day s after the last dose of MTX study  drug.

a. Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (withdrawal of informed consent) or may discontinue study drug treatment, but may choose to continue to participate in the 
study (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  If a subject is prematurely discontinued from study drug, the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit 
(PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of study drug discontinuation.
b. The Baseline Visit procedures will serve as the reference for all subsequent visits with the exception of the ECG and x -rays of hands and feet, which will be obtained at 
Screening only and used as the baseline reference (see also footnote l regarding x -rays of the hands and feet at Screening).
c. This visit is 30 days after last dose of study drug for those subjects who prematurely disconti nue from study drug and study participation.  A 30 -day follow -up phone call may 
occur for subjects who prematurely discontinued from study drug and study participation to determine the status of any ongoin g AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new 
AEs/SAEs.  
d. Informed consent should be obtained at Screening prior to performing any study related procedures.
e. Also note herpes zoster and hepatitis B vaccination status in medical history.  
f. Collect serious adverse events and protocol -related nonserious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consent, prior to the first dose of study drug.
g. At Week 48 (after Week 48 assessments have been performed), per Investigator judgment, may add csDMARDs (concomitant use of u p to 2 csDMARDs, except the 
combi nation of MTX and leflunomide), or increasing csDMARD dose.
h. Prior to other procedures.  For morning stiffness, duration will be captured only if NRS rating is > 0.
i. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures TB Testing for specific requirements for TB testing and TB prophylaxis.  QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (and/or PPD skin test) is not 
required at the PD visit.

j. The screening chest x -ray will not be required if a subject had a previous normal chest-x-ray within 90 days of Screening, provided that all source documentation is available 
at the site (refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Chest X -Ray for specific requirements).  At Week 48, obtain chest x -ray for subjects with TB risk factors as identified by the TB risk 
assessment form or for subjects living in areas endemic for TB or for subjects with a newl y positive QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (and/or PPD skin test) after baseline.  A 
chest x -ray is not required at the PD visit.
k. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided al l sou rce documentation is available.  Refer to 
Section 5.3.1.1 12-Lead ECG for additional details.  All subjects will have an ECG at Week 48 and PD visit as applicable.
l. X-rays of hands and feet must be performed during the screening process.  Subjects are eligible for the study if the locally re ad screening x -rays confirms the presence of 
≥ 1bone erosion OR in the absence of the documented bone erosion, both positive RF and positive anti -CCP autoantibodies are required.  Screening x -rays will serve as 
baseline x-rays for scoring purposes.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures X -Rays of Hands and Feet for additional details.
m. For handling of x -rays during the study, please refer to Section 5.3.1.1 .
n. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
o. A full physical exam is r equired at the visits indicated.  A symptom -directed physical exam may be performed when necessary.
p. For all women of childbearing potential, collect serum for pregnancy test at screening.  If serum pregnancy test comes back b orderline, a repeat test is necessary (pregnancy is 
an exclusion criterion).  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
q. For all women of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits.  If urine pregnancy test ( which is performed at the site) is 
negative, begin or continue dosing.  If urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and pe rform a serum pregnancy test.  Pregnant subjects must permanently discontinue 
study drug.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
r. Central lab hsCRP results will remain blinded to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and subject for all visits except Screening.  Results of tests such as hsCRP 
may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, th ereby limiting the clinical utility of these tests in the setting of a possible safety assessment or adverse event management . 
Any local hsCRP or local CRP tests should not be reported to the investigator until treatment allocation is unblinded.
s. Minimu m 8-hour fast.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
t. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits.  A microscopic analysis will be performed in the event the dipstick 
results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.
u. If required by country regulatory authorities to confirm eligibility, subjects will be tested for antibodies to HIV at Screening, and it should be documented that the test has 
been performed.  This testing is to be done at a local lab.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test r esults indicate a positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will not 
receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.
v. For subjects in Japan only, VZV skin test will be performed locally at Screening.
w. For subjects in Japan only , VZV specific IgG will be measured centrally at Screening.

x. At Week 2 and Week 4 Visits, PK samples should be collected prior to dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood 
sample.  However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing 
schedule and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit.
y. PK samples should be col lected at any time during the visit.  Subject should follow the regular dosing schedule.
z. Samples only collected if subject provides written consent.
aa. Rescue therapy is clearly outlined for subjects who meet the criteria described in Section 5.2.3.3 .
bb. Rescue therapy for those subjects who meet the following criteria at Week 26 is described in Section 5.2.3.3 .
cc. For subjects entering Period 2.
Note: Visit window is ± 3 days for the first 32 weeks and ± 7 days for the remainder of Period 1.  Any of the procedures may be per form ed at an unscheduled visit at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  Subjects who choose to discontinue study drug treatment, but continue to participate in the study, should complete a 
Premature Discontinuation Visit (PD Visit) as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks.  Refer to Section 5.1Discontinuation of Study Drug and 
Continuation of Study Participation (Period 1 and Period 2) for additional details.

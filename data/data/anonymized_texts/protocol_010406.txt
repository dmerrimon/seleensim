 1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable  United States  government regulations and Mayo Clinic  research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
 
Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a chronic, disfiguring, relapsing -remitting inflammatory disease  
primarily involving the lower extremities. NL disproportionately afflicts younger patients and is  
classically associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). Clinically,  NL presents with atrophic yellow  
telangiectatic plaques that ulcerate in 30% of patients .1-5  
 
Although multiple therapies have been used  to treat NL lesions, experience is largely anecdotal 
and there is paucity of data to guide  effective treatment. Topical, intralesional, and systemic 
corticosteroids have been effective in a  small number of non -DM patients6; however , 
corticosteroids are high -risk treatment option in  diabetic patients because they increase blood 
glucose levels and promote insulin r esistance.  Various non -steroidal immunosuppressants have 
been used, including methotrexate, tumor  necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, mycophenolate 
mofetil, and fumaric acid esters, all with mixed  success. Better treatment options with acceptable 
risk/benefi t profile are clearly needed.  
 
To characterize NL at the molecular level, we performed RNA sequencing to identify underlying 
immune mechanisms and possible  therapeutic targets. We sequenced 18 representative NL tissues  
and 5 normal skin tissues, and identified deregulated genes enriched for immune system  functions. 
Independent validation was performed using a Nanostring expression panel (594  immune -specific 
genes), demonstrating high concordance in the set of genes identified as  differentially express ed 
by both platforms. Upregulated immunologic processes/pathways  included those involved in T -
helper cell induction, dendritic cell maturation, macrophage  stimulation, and autoimmunity, 
indicating diverse immunological pathways are active in NL.  
 
Importantly, we focused on identifying targetable “drivers” of downstream RNA expression  
changes. We prioritized such driver  genes  using by querying multiple drug databases in order to  
identify clinically targetable drivers. Using stringent criteria, we id entified JAK1/2  and IFNγ  as 
key, activated drivers, and ruxolitinib as one of  the most highly rated potential therapeutics in this 
search.  
 
Interestingly, a recent report of an  individual with polycythemia vera and NL reported near total 
resolution of his  ulcerated NL upon  treatment with oral ruxolitonib7. Based upon our discovery 
of JAK -induced immune  upregulation, we propose an open label, single arm study of topical 
ruxolitinib cream  for NL patients  to determine the effect of JAK inhibition on NL lesions. The 
primary objective will be the  assessment of the impact of topical ruxolitinib cream on NL in a 
pilot setting, with the secondary objective  being safety of treatment in NL patients. In order to 
further understand the responses,  investigate the molecular effect of JAK inhibition , and explore 
Ruxolitinib cream in NL                                                                                                                                       Version 5.0

 potential biomarkers , we propose  to RNA sequence tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells pre - and post -treatment.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
 
Ruxolitinib  is an inhibitor of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases. Mitogenic and 
inflammatory cytokines are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, alopecia areata, 
atopic dermatitis, and lichenoid tissue reactions of the skin including NL. Ruxo litinib cream also 
potently inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT proteins and the production of pro -inflammatory 
factors induced by cytokines such as IL -23 and IFNγ. (Investigator’s Brochure)  
 
Ruxolitinib cream 1.5%, topical application  will be used  twice daily on lesions of NL. 
1.3 Preclinical Data  
Ruxolitinib potently (IC50 < 5 nM) inhibits JAK1 and JAK2, yet it does not significantly inhibit 
(< 30% inhibition) a broad panel of 26 kinases when tested at 200 nM (approximately 100 times 
the average IC50 value  for JAK enzyme inhibition). Moreover, in cell -based assays relevant to 
the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases, such as IL -2–stimulated phosphorylation of 
STATs and IL -2–induced proliferation of T cells, ruxolitinib demonstrates excellent potency 
(IC50 values of 10 to 40 nM). This effect was not due to general cytotoxicity because ruxolitinib 
(up to 10 μM) had no effect on the survival of resting T cells (without IL -2 stimulation). 
Ruxolitinib also potently inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT prot eins and the production of 
proinflammatory factors induced by cytokines such as IL -23 and IFN -γ. Topical application of 
ruxolitinib demonstrated excellent efficacy in an in vivo model of immune -based skin 
inflammation, the DTH model in mice, including redu ced ear swelling, reduced immune cell 
infiltrates, and normalization of tissue histology. Further, ruxolitinib was also efficacious in the 
inflammatory phase of the dorsal DTH model when applied in a clinically relevant cream 
formulation. In summary, pharm acological data obtained with in vitro and in vivo model systems 
support the use of topically applied ruxolitinib cream in the treatment of psoriasis, AD, vitiligo, 
and other inflammatory diseases of the skin. For all preclinical data below, please refer t o the IB 
for more details.  
 
The absorption, PK, distribution, and metabolism of ruxolitinib were characterized in CD -1® 
mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys, beagle dogs, and Gottingen minipigs. The metabolism of 
ruxolitinib was characterized in vitro in the rat, dog, and human and in vivo  in the CD -1 mouse, 
rat, dog, minipig, and human.  The toxicologic and toxicokinetic profiles of ruxolitinib were 
characterized in rats, dogs , rabbits and the Gottingen minipig . Additional studies include the 
mass balance excretion of 14C-ruxolitinib in ra ts, dogs, and humans after oral dosing, the tissue 
distribution in rats after an oral dose, and the skin distribution in Gottingen minipigs after daily 
topical application.    
 
Based on human data, the relative bioavailability of ruxolitinib cream was mark edly (~90%) 
lower than that following oral administration. The primary clearance pathway is via metabolism.  
In vitro  metabolism studies show that CYP3A4 is the predominant CYP isozyme responsible for 
the metabolism of ruxolitinib.

Ruxolitinib cream (up to 1.5%) was well -tolerated when applied daily for up to 9 months in the 
Gottingen minipig. Observed decreases in lymphocytes were considered nonadverse in the 
absence of any other findings suggestive of systemic toxicity. Ruxolitinib  did not induce contact 
sensitization, and dermal and ocular irritation was minimal to negligible. Ruxolitinib does not 
have acute phototoxicity or photoallergic potential. There was no evidence of systemic toxicity 
following repeated ocular administration  to rabbits or dogs.  
 
Ruxolitinib administered as a single oral dose produced adverse effects on respiratory function in rats 
and blood pressure in dogs at exposures that were several -fold higher than in patients administered 
ruxolitinib cream.  
 
Administr ation of oral ruxolitinib to juvenile rats beginning at Days 7, 14, or 21 postpartum 
(approximately equivalent to a human newborn, 1 -year-old, or 2 -year old , respectively)  resulted in 
effects on growth and bone. In animals administered ruxolitinib beginnin g on Day 21 postpartum, the 
NOAEL was considered to be 15 mg/kg per day. There was no indication of a generalized or 
persistent effect on bone growth. Systemic exposure at this dose was several -fold higher than that 
observed in patients administered ruxoli tinib cream.  
 
Oral administration of ruxolitinib to pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in maternal toxicity and 
minimal embryo -fetal toxicity only at the highest doses evaluated. Ruxolitinib was not teratogenic in 
either species. The NOAEL for both rats and rabbits was 30 mg/kg per day. In an evaluation of 
fertility and early embryonic development, no effects were noted on reproductive performance or 
fertility in male or female rats. Increases in postimplantation loss were noted at the higher doses. In a 
pre- and postnat al development study in rats, there were no adverse effects on embryo -fetal or 
postnatal survival, growth, and developmental parameters.  
 
Ruxolitinib was not mutagenic or clastogenic, nor did it demonstrate potential for carcinogenicity in 
a 6-month study in Tg.rasH2 mice or in 2 -year studies in mice or rats.  
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
 
Plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib cream were determined f ollowing topical application of 
ruxolitinib cream in plaque psoriasis, AA, AD, and vitiligo, mostly using sparse sampling. The 
exposures of ruxolitinib were generally strength -dependent with moderate intersubject variability.  
 
In Study INCB 18424 -201 in p laque psoriasis, the observed systemic bioavailability of ruxolitinib 
was independent of formulation strength.  
 
In Study INCB 18424 -202 in plaque psoriasis, an intensive sampling scheme was used on the last 
day of treatment to better characterize the PK f ollowing topical application. The systemic PK 
following topical application was characterized by apparent first -order release, modest peak -to-
trough excursion (ratio ~2), estimated relative bioavailability of 3% to 5%, and an t ½ of 
approximately 3 days. Sy stemic bioavailability of ruxolitinib cream was shown to be independent of 
the strength of the cream formulation and %BSA. The PD results from skin biopsies, including 
markers for Th1, Th17 pathway activation, reduced levels of inducible nitric oxide synth ase, and 
KRT16 transcript levels, suggest that ruxolitinib cream was pharmacologically active at a local but

 not systemic level when administered to participants with active psoriasis for 28 days as either a QD 
or BID regimen and suggest that key pathologi c pathways in the psoriatic lesion are favorably 
impacted by treatment with ruxolitinib cream.  
In Study INCB 18424 -204 in AA, ruxolitinib trough concentrations increased as percentage scalp 
involvement increased.  
 
In Study INCB 18424 -206 in AD, trough pl asma concentrations increased as the strength of 
ruxolitinib cream and frequency of applications increased. Participants whose plasma concentrations 
exceeded 125 nM (equivalent to half of the IC 50 value based on the effect of ruxolitinib on IL -6) 
tended to  have more extensive skin involvement and highly inflamed AD lesions. However, no 
correlation was observed between higher ruxolitinib blood levels in these participants and their 
response to treatment.  
 
In Study INCB 18424 -102 in AD patients, steady -state plasma concentrations (based on geometric 
mean) following BID administration of 1.5% ruxolitinib cream in adolescent participants were 
similar to that in adult participants.  
 
In Study INCB 18424 -211 in vitiligo, plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib incre ased as the strength 
and frequency of application of the cream were increased.  
 
The plasma metabolite profile following topical application is generally similar to that observed 
following oral administration.  
 
Psoriasis  
Study INCB 18424 -201: a double -blind, vehicle -controlled, increasing strength, safety, tolerability, 
PK, and preliminary efficacy study of ruxolitinib cream 0.5% QD (n = 6), 1.0% QD (n = 6), and 
1.5% BID (n = 6) in Part 1. Efficacy (change from baseline to  Day 28 in mean total lesion scores) 
was consistently shown for the 1.0% QD and 1.5% BID cohorts compared with vehicle. In Part 2, 
1.5% BID showed a change in mean total scores for target lesions compared with Dovonex ® 
(calcipotriene) 0.005% (n = 6) and wi th Diprolene ® AF (betamethasone dipropionate) 0.05% (n = 5) 
at Day 28.  
 
Study INCB 18424 -202: an open -label, multicenter, sequential -cohort, increasing strength, safety, 
tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy study of different regimens of ruxolit inib cream 
applied for 4 weeks (28 days) to participants based on their BSA: 2% to 7% (1.5% BID; n = 5), 8% 
to 13% (1.5% BID; n = 5), 14% to 20% (1.5% BID; n = 5), 14% to 20% (1.0% BID; n = 5), and 14% 
to 20% (1.5% QD; n = 5). The results of this study ind icated that all 5 of these regimens were 
effective in decreasing the individual signs of lesion severity, lesion area, and the overall disease 
severity of psoriatic plaques.  
 
Study INCB 18424 -203: a double -blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel -group, v ehicle -controlled 
dose-ranging study to compare the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream 0.5% (n = 51), 1.0% (n = 
49), or 1.5% (n = 49) QD with a vehicle cream (n = 50) when applied for 12 weeks (84 days). 
Overall, 199 participants were enrolled of whi ch 161 (80.9%) completed the Day 84 visit. Within 
each active treatment group, the mean scores for the individual and total psoriasis lesion assessments, 
the PASI, and the PGA, as well as the mean treatable percent BSA decreased from baseline to each 
subse quent assessment, which indicated an overall lessening of disease severity.

Alopecia Areata  
Study INCB 18424 -204: a 2 -part study with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID applied for 24 weeks. 
Part A (n = 12) was open -label and Part B (n = 78) was double -blind, r andomized, and vehicle -
controlled. Participants enrolled in Part B were to receive ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID or placebo 
for 24 weeks. If eligible, participants in Parts A and B could have continued on to an open -label 
extension period (24 weeks) and long -term extension period (48 weeks). The primary endpoint 
was not met since no significant difference in SALT50 response in terminal hair was observed 
between the ruxolitinib cream and vehicle groups at Week 24.  
 
Atopic Dermatitis  
Study INCB 18424 -206: a dou ble-blind active - and vehicle -controlled study. In total, 306 
participants received study treatment in 1 of 6 treatment groups: ruxolitinib cream 0.15% QD (n 
= 51), 0.5% QD (n = 51), 1.5% QD (n = 51), and 1.5% BID (n = 50), an active comparator group 
(triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID; n = 51), and a vehicle control group (BID; n = 52). Participants 
received study drug (ruxolitinib cream or vehicle) for 8 weeks and triamcinolone cream for the 
first 4 weeks followed by vehicle only for 4 weeks. All participants w ere offered the option to 
continue treatment for an additional 4 weeks with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID. For the study’s 
primary endpoint (mean percenta ge change from baseline in EASI score with ruxolitinib 1.5% 
cream BID at Week 4), ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID demonstrated a statistically significantly 
larger mean percentage change ( -71.57%) when compared with the vehicle treatment group ( -
11.90%; p < 0.0001). Also, ruxolitinib 1.5% cream QD and 0.5% QD treatment groups showed 
statistically significant large r mean percentage changes from baseline in EASI score at Week 4 ( -
66.72% and -52.80%, respectively) compared with the vehicle treatment group ( -11.90%; p < 
0.0001). At Week 8, all 4 ruxolitinib treatment groups ( -50.24% to -79.01%) had larger 
percentage im provements (decreases) from baseline in EASI score than the vehicle treatment 
group ( -21.86%). Ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID ( -71.57%) was noninferior to the triamcinolone 
treatment group ( -59.54%) based on the mean percentage change from baseline in EASI sco re at 
Week 4, with a numerical trend toward superiority. At Weeks 4 and 8, all ruxolitinib treatment 
groups had higher percentages of IGA responders t han the vehicle treatment group.  
 
In INCB 18424 -303, the most frequently reported TEAEs were upper respir atory tract infection 
in 3 participants (1.6%) and dermatitis atopic, ear infection, gastroenteritis, headache, papule, 
pruritus, and respiratory tract congestion in 2 participants each (1.0% each). In INCB 18424 -304, 
the most frequently reported TEAEs wer e application site pain in 5 participants (1.5%), headache 
and nasopharyngitis in 4 participants each (1.2% each), and application site pruritus, 
oropharyngeal pain, and upper respiratory tract infection in 3 participants each (0.9% each).  
 
No fatal TEAEs were reported, and few serious TEAEs occurred across the program.

 In addition to the safety pharmacology and toxicology studies that were completed to support 
development of ruxolitinib cream . The relative bioavailabi lity of ruxolitinib cream  was markedly 
(~ 90%) lower than that following oral administration. In vitro metabolism studies strongly 
suggest that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the predominant CYP isozyme responsible for the 
metabolism of Ruxolitinib cream . 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID was generally found to be the 
most efficacious regimen in studies with AD and psoriasis ( see below ) and hence this regimen is 
also proposed for this trial.  
 
Ruxolitinib cream  has been evaluated in over 200 subjects with plaque psoriasis in 3 clinical 
studies with dosing of 1 to 3 months' duration. Study INCB 18424 -201 was a double -blind, 
vehicle -controlled, rising -dose, safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy study o f 
INCB01824 1% cream applied QD and 1.5% cream applied BID. All adverse events (AEs) were 
mild to moderate in intensity and most judged unrelated to study medication, with no associated 
serious AEs (SAEs) or withdrawals. Laboratory and ECG evaluations did not suggest any safety 
issues, specifically no instances of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia.  
 
INCB 18424 -202 was an open -label, multicenter, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation, safety, 
tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy study of Ruxolitinib cream  
1.0% or 1.5% applied to 2% to 20% BSA QD or BID for 4 weeks. Application area increased 
sequentially, and alternative dosing paradigms were explored at the highest application area. The 
efficacy analyses collectively dem onstrated efficacy of all 5 regimens of Ruxolitinib cream  in 
psoriasis. The incidence of all reported AEs, the clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG 
findings showed no confirmed safety signals or trends. Mean topical bioavailability ranged from  
3.4% to 5.2% with no significant inhibition of cohort mean PD. Overall, Ruxolitinib cream  
(1.0% or 1.5%) was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated when applied QD or BID for 28 
days to plaque psoriasis affecting 2% to 20% of the BSA.  
 
INCB 18424 -203 was a double -blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, vehicle -controlled 
dose-ranging study with application of Ruxolitinib cream  or vehicle in subjects with stable 
plaque psoriasis.  Overall, Ruxolitinib cream  (0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5%) was demonstrated to be safe 
and well tolerated when applied QD for 12 weeks to plaque psoriasis affecting 2% to 20% of the 
BSA.”  
 
Study INCB 18424 -206 was a double -blind active - and vehicle -controlled study in adults with 
AD. Three hundred seven participants were randomiz ed, and 306 participants received blinded 
study treatment.  Those who received treatment in the 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID arm achieved 
a significantly larger improvement from baseline when compared to the vehicle treatment group. 
Thus, we propose to use th at same dosing regimen in this trial as it has demonstrated efficacy in 
treatment of  AD and psoriasis in other trials.  
 
1.6 Risk s and Benefits  
 
Benefits:  
Ruxolitinib cream in NL                                                                                                                                       Version 5.0

 Pregnancy Risk : 
The effect of the study drug on a fetus (developing baby still in the womb), or on a breastfeeding 
infant,  is unknown and may be harmful. Because of these risks, women cannot take part in this 
study if they are pregnant or breastfeeding.  
 
Skin biopsy:  
A skin biopsy is generally a safe procedure, but some potential risks may include local pain, mild 
local bruis ing, bleeding, scarring, and an infection at the site where the skin biopsy was 
performed.  If a topical antibiotic is used afterwards, then there is a small risk of an allergic 
reaction.  
 
Chest X -ray: 
Subjects  will be exposed to radiation from the chest x -ray. The amount of radiation has a low 
risk of harmful effects.  
 
Blood draw:  
The risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and/or fainting, or rarely, 
infection at the site of the needle stick.   
 
Other:  
As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised; however, we 
take precaut ions to minimize this risk.  
 
 
2 Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective : 
To determine the efficacy of ruxolitinib cream  as measured by the change in NL score (0 -12) of 
the index treatment lesions (weeks 0 and 12). In prior psoriasis studies including Study INCB 
18424 -201 and Study INCB 18424 -202, preliminary efficacy (change from baseline) was evident 
by Day 28. However, t he single case report of NL treated with systemic ruxolitinib required 3 
months of therapy. Therefore, we will request 12 weeks of therapy.  
 
Secondary Objective : 
To determine the efficacy of INCB018424 and the duration of response after discontinuation as  
measured by the change in 24 hour recall of Pruritus NRS, (week 0 to week 4, week 0 to week 8, 
week 0 to week 12 , week 0 to 16 , weeks 4 to 8,  weeks 8 to 12 , weeks 12 to 16 ), Change in 
Skindex -16 (week 0 to week 4, week 0 to week 8, week 0 to week 12, week 0 to 16, weeks 4 to 
8, weeks 8 to 12 , weeks 12 to 16 ), Change in Physician Global Assessment (PGA) ( week 0 to 
week 4, week 0 to week 8, week 0 to week 12, week 0 to week 16, weeks 4 to 8,  weeks 8 to 12 , 
weeks 12 to 16 ), Change in BSA ( week 0 to week 4, week 0 to week 8, week 0 to week 12, week 
0 to 16, weeks 4 to 8,  weeks 8 to 12 , weeks 12 to 16 ), Change in NL Lesion Score ( week 0 to 
week 4, week 0 to week 8, week 0 to week 12, week 0 to 16, weeks 4 to 8,  weeks 8 to 12 , weeks 
12 to 16 ).

Exploratory Objectives:  
To predict responses and examine the pharmacodynamics of treatment through the  identification  
of unique biomarkers and transcriptomic changes of NL at week 0 and utilizing  RNA sequencing 
on responsive and non -responsive tissue at week 4 To correlate these  biomarkers with measures 
of global response: NL Lesion Score, PGA, and BSA.  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Description  
 
This is a single center, exploratory, open -label, single -arm design study of 12 patients. Treatment 
naïve and treatment refractory patients with NL will be treated with ruxolitinib cream . Patients 
who are non -responders, to physician choice standard of car e, such as t opical, intralesional, and 
systemic or various non -steroidal including methotrexate, tumor  necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, 
mycophenolate mo fetil and fumaric acid esters will undergo a washout period and will be 
enrolled in the study.  
 
Multiple safety studies have been conducted with ruxolitinib cream (see Safety) and a treatment 
regimen  of 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID on up to 20% BSA is deemed safe  (Investigator’s 
Brochure) . Due to the thinned skin and potential for ulceration of NL, we will only treat up to 
10% BSA  Therefore, we propose a single center, exploratory, open -label, single -arm design 
study of 12 patients. Treatment naïve and treatment refractory patients with NL will be treated 
with ruxolitinib cream . 
 
Individuals with NL will be eligible. All lesions will be treated , annotated, photographed, and 
scored. Prior treatment will be allowed; however, a washout period of 2 weeks for topical and 4 
weeks for systemic agents  which may alter disease course  is required. At the washout period, 
individuals will undergo evaluation with a PGA , BSA calculation  and NL lesion  score lesion. 
Additional Pruritus measures using the NRS and Skindex -16 will be collected at that time.  
 
Individuals will then initiate trea tment on all lesions of NL BID and will be evaluated weekly 
and assessed by PGA, BSA, NL lesion score , Pruritus NRS, and Skindex -16 between weeks 0 -4 
(see Appendix). At week 12 will be the primary endpoint; however therapy will be continued for 
an addition al 4 weeks. Therapy will be stopped and the individuals will be evaluated at week 12 
and assessed by PGA, BSA, NL lesion score , Pruritus NRS, and Skindex -16. Laboratory and 
safety monitoring will occur at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 , 16. 3D photographs will be  taken at weeks 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 , 16. Individual lesions will be circled at that time  and the exact volume of each 
lesion will be measured  through use of 3D images . Up close photos will be taken of the disease 
and normal tissues attained at weeks 0 &  12.  
 
Tissue will be collected for RNA sequencing at week 0 and 4. Blood collection will include the 
isolation at week 0, 2, 4 , 8, 12 . 5mL vials of blood which will be separated and the serum and cell

 pellet will be stored for future analysis. Three  skin b iopsies will be taken during the study. At week 
0, one 3mm tissue biops y will be taken from lesional skin and one biopsy will be taken from non-
lesional ( adjacent but normal -appearing  a minimum of 2 cm from the primary lesion but within 
the same anatomical subunit ) skin. At week  4, a 3mm biopsy  will be taken  from a treated lesion 
(Ideally the same lesion as the initial biopsy, separated by a minmum of 1cm, or a similar lesion 
in the s ame anatomical subunit) . The lesions will be chosen using full body photographs taken at 
week 0. From the biopsy specimen, a small piece of tissue (approximately 1 mm) will be cut and 
placed in a bottle labeled for RNAseq. The larger specimen will be place d in a bottle labeled for 
biobank  storage . Both samples will be snap frozen  and stored in the biobank . Once sample 
collection is completed  for all samples , the tissues labeled for biobank storage will continue to be 
stored in the biobank and RNA sequencing will be performed on  the tissue samples labeled for 
RNAseq ( up to  36 tissue samples ) and analysis will be performed. Paired analysis of treatment 
respons ive and refractory lesions will be made as well as treated and untreated lesions.  
 
Nucleic Acid Extractions: RNA will be extracted from a total of 50 um of fresh tissue using the 
Qiagen FFPE RNeasy Micro extraction Kit according to manufacturer’s recommen dation.  
 
RNA Transcriptome Sequencing: RNA transcriptome sequencing will be carried out using 
commercially available techniques.  Briefly, RNA libraries will be created using up to 100ng of 
RNA as starting material using the Illumina  RNA TruSeq  Library ki t according to 
manufacturer’s recommendation. Libraries will be QCed for quality and quantity using the 
Illumina TapeStation  High Sensitivity tape. Paired-end sequencing will then be carried out on the 
Illumina HiSeq 4000 using 101bp insert fragments.

All efficacy assessments will be performed prior to the administration of study treatment at each 
visit. The recommended order and the overall outline of measurements for the efficacy 
assessments are described below.

3.6 Primary Safety Endpoints  
 
A thorough baseline screening will be followed for all patients and is outlined in Table -2. A 
detailed list of the methods in which baseline screening will be performed is outlined in 
Supplemental 2. All blood draws and safety assessments must be performed prior to study 
treatment administrati on. Appropriate safety assessments (e.g., evaluation of AEs and SAEs) 
should be repeated after dosing with study treatment. A physical examination, including general 
appearance and vital signs, will be performed as indicated in Table -2. If indicated, based  on 
medical history and/or symptoms, additional exams will be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator. If possible, the same member of the study site staff throughout the study will 
perform assessments for an individual subject. Information for all  physical examinations will be 
included in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior 
to the subject signing informed consent will be included in the Medical History. Significant 
findings made after the signing of the informed consent, which meet the definition of an AE, 
must be recorded as an AE. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, height, weight) will be assessed at 
each physical examination as indicated in Table -2 (see Supplemental 2 for details on how to 
acqu ire vital signs). Whether action needs to be taken to address notable vital signs will be 
decided by the investigator, considering the overall status of the subject. Laboratory studies will 
be drawn as indicated in Table -2. Whether action needs to be taken  to address notable laboratory 
values will be decided by the investigator, considering the overall status of the subject. 
Hematology assessments will be measured at all scheduled study visits specified in Table -2. 
Serum chemistry will be a comprehensive me tabolic panel will be measured at all scheduled 
study visits specified in Table -2. 
 
If the prohibited treatment is being used during the study for any indication, the subject must 
discontinue use of the prohibited treatment if he/she wishes to continue in the study.  In case of 
undue safety risk for the subject, the subject should discontinue study treatment at the discretion 
of the investigator/qualified site staff. If the subject received a live virus vaccination during the 
study, the subject must discont inue study treatment.

7 Statisti cal Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
 Data analysis: Due to the costs associated with a study, we propose a single armed study of 12 
subjects  with corollary science including RNA sequencing. This will reduce costs and provide 
Ruxolitinib in NL   Version 5.0 
  01/29/2021 
 
Page  28 of 47 
Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D.    CONFIDENTIAL  biomarkers predictive of response. Effect sizes will be estimated for the appropriate statistical 
tests that will be used for group comparisons in future studies. This wil l enable more accurate 
power and sample size estimates moving forward.  
 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
Sample Size Computation and Power Analysis : 
The sample size for this pilot study is set at 12 subject s for logistical and financial reasons. This 
is similar in size to other exploratory studies and will provide adequate data for estimation 
purposes for planning future studies.  With 12 subjects , the study is intended to be for estimation 
purposes only.    
 
Statistical Analysis Plan:  
Data Analysis - The statistical analysis will provide descriptive summary statistics for categorical 
and continuous outcomes.  Categorical variables will be described by their count and proportion 
of occurrence while continuous, normally distributed variab les will be described by their mean 
and standard deviation; and continuous, non -normally distributed variables will be described by 
their median and range. The paired or unpaired Wilcoxon tests will be used to quantify 
differences in numerical outcomes whi le the Fisher’s exact test and the McNemar’s or Bowker’s 
tests will be used to quantify changes in categorical variables.  
 
If missingness occurs at random a mixed model will be utilized to assess the change in the lesion 
over time. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the last observation carried forward and 
the results will be compared to that of the mixed -model.  
 
Effect sizes will be estimated for the appropriate statistical tests that will be used for group 
comparisons in future studies. This will enable more accurate power and sample size estimates 
moving forward.  
 
Bioinformatic Analysis :  
RNA -seq analysis: We  will use our recently developed LinNorm  program 
 to process RNA -seq 
data and detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing the RNA -seq profiles. We 
will first find DEG between responsive and non -responsive samples  from the same individual by 
using paired or unpaired Wilcoxon rank -sum test (depending on how the samples are collected). 
We will then rank each gene in the DEGs based on the occurrence frequencies in all 12 subject s 
to find common DEGs for responsiveness (use permutation test to determine the p value).  By 
comparing the normal tissue with the pathogenic tissue (responsive + non -responsible) using the 
above approach, we will detect a common DEGs for NL pathogenesis. Hierarchical clustering 8 
and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 9 will be a pplied to samples for their hierarchical 
relationship and clustering properties. Ideally normal, responsive and non -responsible tissues 
should form three distinct groups. The PCA analysis will provide us a set of gene signatures that 
can distinguish these three types of tissues. The common DEGs for responsiveness and 
pathogenesis, as well as gene signature from PCA will be used for our pathogenesis or survival

profile s of responsive and non -responsive tissue and to correlate immune profiles. Predictive 
biomarkers will be correlated with lesional and global responses.   
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
• All-completed population :  All subjects that receive at least one dose will be considered 
for analysis.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPIRTSO)  
 
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new inf ormation (i.e. 
publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opinion 
of the local investigator may adversely affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects 
or others, or substantially compromise the research data , AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
"unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it i s possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include ; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospitalization  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant  disab ility or incapacity  
• birth defect/anomaly

and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opinion of the sponsor -investigator  
may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromised the rese arch data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is defined as 30 days following the last 
administration of study treatment.   
 
 
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse 
event.   
 
A thorough baseline screening will be followed for all subjects  and is outlined in Table -2. A 
detailed list of the methods in which baseline screening will be performed is outlined in 
Supplemental 2 . All blood draws and safety assessments must be performed prior  to study 
treatment administration. Appropriate safety assessments (e.g., evaluation of AEs and SAEs) 
should be repeated after dosing with study treatment. A physical examination, including general 
appearance and vital signs, will be performed as indicated  in Table -2. If indicated, based on 
medical history and/or symptoms, additional exams will be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator. If possible, the same member of the study site staff throughout the study will 
perform  assessments for an individual subject. Information for all physical examinations will be 
included in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior 
to the subject signing informed consent will be included in the Me dical History. Significant 
findings made after the signing of the informed consent, which meet the definition of an AE, 
must be recorded as an AE. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, height, weight) will be assessed at 
each physical examination as indicate d in Table -2 (see Supplemental 2  for details on how to 
acquire vital signs). Whether action needs to be taken to address notable vital signs will be 
decided by the investigator, considering the o verall status of the subject.

Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D.    CONFIDENTIAL   
Skin Scoring:  
There are no validated skin scoring systems for NL. One prior publication developed a non -
validated NL skin scoring system (0 -12) which examines erythema, infiltration, ulceration, and 
pain10. We will use other simple measures of BSA which is objective and PGA which is well 
validated in other inflammatory skin conditions11-13. Additionally, we will simply annotate the 
number of lesions on the individual as a marker of total disease burden.  
 
 
Itch Scoring:  
 
The NRS and Skindex -16 are all well validated measure of itch14,15. The First score measure 
focuses in upon a gestalt of itch. The later scoring system focuses in upon the itch and its impact 
upon quality of life.  
 
Supplemental 2: Safety Measures  
 
 
 
 
Baseline Screening:  
 
A serum β -hCG  test will be performed in all pre -menopausal women as indicated. All pre -
menopausal women who are not sterile at screening will also have a urine pregnancy test 
performed locally as indicated. Any woman with a confirmed positive pregnancy test during 
screening is not eligible for the study. A positive urine pregnancy test during the treatment 
periods of the study requires immediate interruption of study treatment until serum β -hCG is 
performed and found to be negative. If the serum β -hCG test is positive, study treatment must be 
definitively discontinued.  
 
Blood Pressure and Pulse:  
 
Height and Weight:  
Height and body weight will be measured in indoor clothing, but without shoes. If possible, body 
weight assessments should be performed by th e same study site staff member and using the same 
scale throughout the study.  
 
Blood Draws:  
Subjects should avoid smoking within the hour preceding the blood draws. All laboratory studies 
will be conducted within the Mayo Clinic Health Systems (Mayo Clinic  Arizona and Mayo 
Clinic Rochester). Details on the collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results will 
follow Mayo Clinic’s current protocols. For the identification of notable values, the Mayo Clinic 
reference laboratory should be consulted.

Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D.    CONFIDENTIAL  Supplemental 3: Safety Monitoring  
 
Infection monitoring:  
Study subjects will be evaluated at each visit for signs or symptoms of infection.  
• Vitals signs as well as constitutional symptoms will be assessed.  
• Assessment for common infections such as cellulitis as well as oral, vaginal, and cutaneous 
candidiasis will be performed  
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the sponsor -investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last 
scheduled visit, the sponsor -investigator should instruc t each subject to report , to the sponsor -
investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if   
 
 
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms,  
• they are considered clinically significant,  
• they require therapy.  
 
Laboratory studies will be drawn as indicated in Table -2. Whether action needs to be taken to 
address notable laboratory values will be decided by the investigator, considering the overall 
status of the subject. Hematology assessments will be measured at all scheduled study visits 
specified in Table -2. Serum chemistry will be a comprehensive metabolic panel will be measured 
at all scheduled study visits specified in Table -2. 
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:   
 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for d iagnostic or elective surgical procedures 
for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.  
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the study team  must seek information on adverse events by 
specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events

event section  of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic , laboratory or  procedure results should recorded in the source document . 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable  cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up , to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during the Adverse Event Reporting  
 
 
Period  and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
 
When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriated action 
necessary to protect the study participant and then co mplete the Stu dy Adverse Event Worksheet 
and log.  The sponsor -investigator will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up 
and reporting required.  
 
8.3.1 Sponsor -Investigator  reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB  
 
The sponsor -investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPIRTSOs and Non -UPIRTSOs 
according to the Mayo IRB Policy and Procedures.  
 
Action taken regarding treatment

Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D.    CONFIDENTIAL  An SAE is defined as any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following 
criteria (Life -threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at 
risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might 
have caused death if more severe.):  
• Is fatal or life -threatening  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity  
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
•  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is for:  
o Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associate d with any 
deterioration in condition (specify what this includes)  
o Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent  
o Treatment on an emerge ncy outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission  
o Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s 
general condition  
• Is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention.  
 
SAE Reporting:  
 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of causality, occurring after the patient has 
provided informed consent and until 30 -days after the subject stopped study participation must 
be reported to the Incyte as soon as possible but no later than 5 days from learning of its 
occurrence according to the Mayo Clinic IRB policy. Any SAEs experienced after  the 30 -days 
period should only be reported to Incyte and the Mayo Clinic IRB if the investigator suspects a 
causal relationship to study treatment. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the 
initial SAE must be reported as follow -up to the o riginal episode, regardless of when the event 
occurs. This report must be submitted as soon as possible but no later than 5 days from the 
investigator receiving the follow -up information. SAE should be followed up until resolution or 
until it is judged to be permanent. An SAE that is considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.

Page  37 of 47 
Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D.    CONFIDENTIAL   
Unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be 
reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 
3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt  of the 
information about the event.  
 
Other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious 
suspected adverse reacti on.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 
15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the 
event.  
 
Any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse reactions over those 
listed in the protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  
This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the 
sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
Findings from other studies in human or an imals that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the drug will be reported.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no 
later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigators initial receipt of the information about 
the event.  
 
SAE Reporting to the Sponsor (Incyte)  
 
Incyte needs to be notified within 24 hours of learning of an event. Incyte also needs to be provided 
a completed SAE form via email. SAE reporting for each subject begins the day the informed 
consent is signed by the patient and within 30 days after subject has completed or discontinued 
from the study or has taken last dose of the study drug, or as described in the IST protocol.  
 
SAEs, occurring using Incyte Study drug, are reported in  accordance with the effective protocol.  
SAEs occurring with any another commercial drug are reported to manufacturer of that drug in 
accordance with regulations and protocol.  
 
Initial Serious Adverse events (SAEs) and/or subsequent follow -up reports sho uld be reported via 
email to: or fax .  SAE reports should be for a 
single subject. SAE forms will be e -mailed with a cover sheet and any additional attachments.  
 
All adverse event information is reported to Incyte on the Principal Investigator’s/Institution’s 
Adverse Event Report Form, or a CIOMS -I or MedWatch Form FDA 3500A, or on an Adverse 
Event Report Form which may be provided by Incyte upon request. The Pri ncipal Investigator 
does not provide medical records (e.g., discharge summary) to Incyte, unless specifically 
requested.  
 
Copies of IND safety reports submitted to the FDA by the Institution will be shared with the 
contact above  so that these reports can be evaluated and included in investigator brochure or

Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D.    CONFIDENTIAL  Incyte IND safety submissions as required to ensure safety of other p atients who are receiving 
the product from Incyte for sponsored trials.  
 
Procedure for Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor (Incyte)  
 
An “Initial Pregnancy Report” or equivalent must be completed in full and emailed to 
, fax  within 24 hours of discovery of a 
pregnancy of a subject who has taken the Incyte product or the pregnancy of a partner for a  
 
subject who has taken the Incyte product.  The “Follow -up Pregnancy Report Form” or 
equivalent must be completed and emailed to , fax 
 within 30 days after delivery, so that Incyte is provided with information regarding the 
outcome of the pregnancy.  If the pregnancy results in any events which meet the serious criteria 
(i.e., miscarriage or termination), the SAE reporting process needs to be follo wed and the 
timelines associated with an SAE should be followed.  
 
Stopping Rules  
 
The stopping rules specified below are based on the knowledge available at study development. 
The stopping rule applies to the overall study. We note that the Adverse Event Stopping Rule 
may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re -opening to accrual or (2) at any time 
during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the 
adverse event profile of the treatment(s) und er investigation. The study team may choose to 
suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified 
rule below.  
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events considered 
at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute specified as 
“possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfy the following:  
 
• If 2 or more patients in the first 6 treated patients (or 30% after the first 6 treated patie nts have 
been accrued) experience a grade 3 or higher non -hematologic adverse event.  
 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be 
related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a pre viously unrecognized 
treatment -related adverse event.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate rep orting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -
monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting ”).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the n umber and type of serious adverse events.

Page  39 of 47 
Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D.    CONFIDENTIAL  The occurrence of adverse events will be sought by non -directive questioning of the patient at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when the patient volunteers 
them during or between visits or through physical examination, labor atory test, or other 
assessments. Please see Supplemental 3  for a detailed description of safety monitoring. Clinically 
significant abnormal lab oratory values or test results will be identified through a review of values 
outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the 
previous visit, or values which are non -typical in patient with underlying disease. Investigators 
have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual pati ent and identifying adverse  
 
events. Alert ranges for labs and other test abnormalities are included determined by the Mayo 
Clinic Arizona and Mayo Medical Laboratory. Adverse events will be recorded in the Adverse 
Events Case Report Form (CRF) under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis a ssociated with them, 
and severity. All adverse events will be treated appropriately. Once an adverse event is detected, 
it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment 
should be made at each visit (or more f requently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the 
suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome 
(see Supplemental 3 ). Information about common side effects already  known about the 
investigational drug can be found in the package insert. This information will be included in the 
patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
The investigator will also instruct each patien t to report any new adverse event (beyond the 
protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to study treatment. This information should be recorded in the 
investigator’s source docu ments, however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE. To ensure 
patient safety, every SAE (see Supplemental 3  for definition), regardless of suspected causality, 
occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and after the patient begins taking 
study drug and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study participation will be recorded and 
reported to Incyte. Any SAEs experienced after this 30 -day period should only be reported to 
Incyte if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug. All malignant 
neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria 
are not met. Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether other 
situa tions should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the 
patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the outcome s listed in SAE. Any 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious 
adverse reaction. All AEs (serious and non -serious) are captured and recorded, SAEs also require 
individual reporting ( see Supplemental 3 ). To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring 
while the patient is on study treatment must be reported to the sponsor -investigator within 24 
hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, 
including spontane ous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. 
Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessme nt of 
the possible relationship to the study treatment.  Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and 
unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form.

Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D.    CONFIDENTIAL  9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept  confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 
• What protected health in formation (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
 
The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. Study data will 
be securely  stored on a password protected computer that only the research study team will have 
access to.  Any study related paper documents will be store d in a locked cabinet that only the 
research study team will have access to.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revoca tion of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their sche duled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in so urce documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records 
include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automate d 
instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medi co-technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on 
the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write 
“N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be 
printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has  been made, to correct such an error, draw a 
single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such 
changes must be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or use “white -out” for errors.   For clarification 
of illegible o r uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.   If 
the reason for the correction is not clear or needs additional explanation, neatly include the 
details to justify the correction.

 3 1.0  OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Primary  Objective 
1.1.1. To evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant FOLFOX -A for patients with resected pancreatic cancer  
1.2 Secondary  Objective 
1.2.1 To evaluate the disease- free and overall survival for  patients with resected pancreatic cancer treated 
with adjuvant FOLFOX -A. 
 
2.0  BACKGROUND 
Adjuvant t reatment of pancreatic cancer:  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer 
death in the United States.  Only those patients who have undergone resection have the potential to be cured. 
However, d espite potentially curative resectio n, the 5 -year survival rate is <25 %. 1-3 The benefit of adjuv ant 
radiation is unclear. The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) performed a small, randomized trial 
that demonstrated an improvement in survival for patients receiving adjuvant radiat ion with fluorouracil .4 
However a statistically significant benefit was not detected with radiation in the EORTC and ESPAC 
trials.5,6  
 A multinational German trial (the CONKO -1 trial) randomly assigned 368 patients with resected  pancreatic 
cancer to gemcitabine or no additional therapy. There was a significant improvement in median and 3- year 
survival advantage in the gemcitabine group (median 22.8 versus 20.2 months, p = 0.005, five -year survival 
21 versus 9 percent).
7,8 However, even with gemcitabine, the majority of patients will relapse and die of 
systemic disease. Substantially more effective chemotherapy regimens are needed to incre ase the number 
of patients who can be cured.   
FOLFIRINOX:   The PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial compared FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 
irinotecan and fluorouracil) to gemcitabine for first- line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. The 
trial enrolled 342 patients between 01/2005 and 10/2009. The median overall survival was 11.1 months in the FOLFIRINOX group as compared with 6.8 months in the gemcitabine group (P<0.001).
9 Median 
progression-free survival was 6.4 months in the FOLFIRINOX group and 3.3 months in the gemcitabine 
group. The objective response rate was 31.6% in the FOLFIRINOX group versus 9.4% in the gemcitabine 
group. Grade 3/4 toxicities increased with FOLFIRINOX including neutropenia (18.7% versus 45.7%), febrile neutropenia (0.6% versus 5.4%), diarrhea (1.2% versus 12.7%) and neuropathy (0% to 9%), respectively. It is possible that FOLFIRINOX may improve survival as compared to gemcitabine in the adjuvant pancreatic cancer setting and thi s is being investigated by the consortium in France . However, 
toxicity associated w ith FOLFIRINOX can be prohibitive, especially  for patients recovering from major 
pancreatic cancer su rgery.   
 
Irinotecan is not an effective agent in pancreatic cancer:  The contribution of irinotecan in 
FOLFIRINOX is unclear. Single agent irinotecan is without significant activity in pancreatic cancer.10 
Furthermore, the combination of irinotecan and gemcitabine does not improve survival as compared to gemcitabine alone.
11 However, the inclusion of irinotecan adds substantially to the toxicity of 
FOLFIRINOX.

Abraxane : Abraxane is a biologically interactive albumin -bound paclitaxel combining a protein with a 
chemotherapeutic agent in the particle form. This composition provides a novel approach of increasing 
intra-tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor- mediated transpo rt process allowing transcytosis 
across the endothelial cell. This albumin- specific receptor mediated process involves the binding of 
albumin to a specific receptor (gp60) on the intraluminal endothelial cell membrane, resulting in 
activation of a protein (caveolin -1), which initiates an internalization process in the endothelial cell 
through the formation of caveolae, with transport of the intact albumin-bound chemotherapeutic complex via these caveolae to the underlying tumor interstitium.
12 A protein spe cifically secreted by the tumor 
(SPARC) binds albumin, allowing release of the hydrophobic drug to the tumor cell membrane.
13Abraxane is the first biologically interactive nanoparticle product leveraging this gp-
60/caveolin -1/caveolae/SPARC pathway  to incr ease intra-tumoral concentration of the drug and reducing 
toxic effects in normal tissue.13 Pancreatic cancer cells and surrounding stroma are known to overexpress 
SPARC (secreted protein acid rich in cysteine), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes.13 The 
albumin-bound nanoparticle form of paclitaxel increases tumor accumulation of paclitaxel through binding of albumin to SPARC.

Abraxane  + gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer:   The regimen of Abraxane , 125mg/m2, and gemcitabine, 
1gm/m2, weekly  x 3 weeks in 28 day cycles, was developed by Von Hoff et al in a phase I/II study for 
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.14 A phase III study of 861 patients demonstrated that the 
combination of Abraxane and gemcitabine was superior to gemcitabine alone. As shown in the table 1 
below, overall survival (OS), progression- free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), and 
response rate (RR) were significantly improved in the Abraxane + gemcitabine arm.15

Phase I Study of FOLFOX -Abraxane  (FOLFOX -A): Irinotecan is responsible for much of the toxicity 
of FOLFIRINOX but may not contribute significantly to the regimen’s activity. The addition of irinotecan 
to gemcitabine was not superior to gemcitabine alone. In contrast, the addition of Abraxane to gemcitabine 
increased survival. Therefore, the Brown University Oncology Research Group initiated a protocol to 
remove  irinotecan from FOLFIRINOX and substitute Abraxane – this new regimen is called FOLFOX -A.

 5 All patients received oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 and 5- FU 2400 mg/m2 IV over 46 hours 
with Abraxane . Cycles were repeated every 14 days. Three dose -levels of Abraxane were evaluated:  
• Level 1: Abraxane 125mg/m2 
• Level 2: Abraxane 150 mg/m2  
• Level 3: Abraxane 175 mg/m2  
 
All 3 dose- levels have been evaluated and the maximum tolerated dose has been determined.  Fifteen 
patients were entered: Dose level 1 (n=6), dose level 2 (N=6), dose level 3 (N=3). The median age was 64 
(35-81). Ten patients had metastatic and 5 had locally advanced disease. One of six patients at dose- level 
1 had grade 3 nausea. At dose- level 2, one of six patients had urosepsis with an absolute neutrophil count 
of 900 cell/mm3. Noteworthy was that on dose- level 2 an 81 year-old and a 76 year-old patient have been 
on treatment without significant toxicity.  (In contrast, FOLFIRINOX is not recom mended for patients > 
75 years of age). The MTD of nab-P is 150mg/m2 every 2 weeks with FOLFOX. Cumulative peripheral 
neuropathy, similar to other FOLFOX regimens, is the most significant toxicity generally occurring after > 10 cycles of treatment. FOLFOX- A has substantial activity and may represent a promising regimen in 
pancreatic cancer. Based on the initial activity and toxicity profile from the phase I study, FOLFOX -A 
appears to be a promising regimen for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. To further evaluate efficacy and toxicity, a phase II study will be initiated. To reduce the potential for neurotoxicity, this 
protocol will include dose reductions of oxaliplatin for grade 2 neurotoxicity. 
 
Current proposal - A phase II study of adjuvant FOLFO X-A: Our preliminary data suggests that 
FOLFOX -A may have equal or superior activity as compared to FOLFIRINOX and appears to be better 
tolerate d. Therefore, FOLFOX -A  may be a better regimen in the adjuvant setting for patients with 
resected pancreatic cancer. This protocol will obtain preliminary data on safety and disease- free and 
overall survival following administration of FOLFOX- A for patients with resected pancreatic cancer.

post treatment  
•  Antiemetics will be administered as per standard institutional policy.  
(Adjuvant radiation therapy with concurrent fluoropyrimidine may be administ ered post patient coming 
off FOLFOX -A according to standard institutional policy)  
5.0 TOXICITIES, DOSE MODIFICATIONS, AND MANAGEMENT  
Toxicities will be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event case report form and must be graded 
using The National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) version 4.0 (Appendix C). 
Dose modification table: for neuropathy reductions see section 5.3 
 Starting Dose for all 
patients  Dose level -1 Dose level -2 
Abraxane  150 mg/m2 120 mg/m2   96 mg/m2 
Oxaliplatin  85mg/m2 68 mg/m2 54 mg/m2 
Leucovorin  400 mg/m2 400 mg/m2 400 mg/m2 
5-FU 1200mg/m2 960 mg/m2 768mg/m2 
Each patient can be dose reduced a total of 2 times. All dose reductions are permanent. 
**Please note that if a patient has experienced a reduction for neuropathy (section 5.3) they will 
be receiving doses of drugs from different dose levels** 
Doses of chemotherapeutic agents do not need to be recalculated if weight change is less than 10% of 
total body weight. Weight gain secondary to edema does not require dose re- calculation even if >10%. 
5.1 A new course of treatment should not begin until the following criteria are met:  
• Platelets > 75x109/L (75,000/mm3) 
• Granulocytes >1.0x109/L (1000/mm3) 
• Recovery from other treatment related, non- hematologic toxicities to < Grade 2 , this does not 
include alopecia.     
 If the patient does not meet these criteria delay day 1 until recovery. Delay the cycle, until these 
requirements are met.  Patients who require a treatment delay of more than 4 weeks from the scheduled 
treatment day due to treatment related toxicity will be removed from protocol treatment ( see section 5.3 
for allowed holds for neuropathy) . Treating  investigators may hold treatment for clinical reasons to 
alleviate toxicities as long as the toxicities with grades and delay are documented and submitted to 
BrUOG. 
5.2  A 1 dose- level  permanent  reduction is required for the following:  
• Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm3) 
• ANC <1000/mm3 with fever or infection

Amendment 14 2/20/18, Amendment # 15 6-26-18, Amendment # 16 11/20/18  
 8 • Platelets <25,000/mm3 
• Platelets <50,000/mm3 requiring transfusion 
• Grade 3 or 4 treatment related non- hematologic toxicities excluding alopecia. Grade 3 or 4 
electrolyte abnormalities d o not require a dose modification the electrolyte disorder can be 
corrected to grade 2 or less within 72 hours. This must be documented and submitted to BrUOG. 
• Delay of treatment for > 2 weeks due to toxicity **If the 2 week delay is secondary to neuropathy 
see section 5. 3 for dose reductions for neuropathy ** 
 
 Each patient can be dose reduced a total of 2 times. All dose reductions are permanent.  
5.3  Neuropathy  
The goals of the following dose modification rules are to prevent patients from developing grade 3/4 
neuropathy during or after completion of FOLFOX -A and to facilitate patients being able to receive 12 
cycles of FOLFOX -A without grade 3/4 neuropathy. Fluorouracil and leucovorin are not reduced for 
neuropathy.  
5.3.1 For patients experiencing grade 2 neuropathy: 
• Oxaliplatin should be permanently decreased to Oxaliplatin dose level -1 (68mg/m2) for patients 
who develop grade 2 neuropathy. Patients may continue on treatment with grade 2 neuropathy at 
this 20% reduced dos e of oxaliplatin. Abraxane, 5-FU and Leucovorin doses are not reduced for 
grade 2 neuropathy. 
• It is the investigators discretion to hold FOLFOX -A treatment for up to six weeks secondary to 
patient’s experiencing grade 2 neuropathy. Hold for neuropathy must be documented. 
• For patients developing grade 2 neuropathy, it is the investigators discretion to stop FOLFOX- A 
after 10 cycles instead of continuing to 12 cycles. Reason for patient discontinuing treatment 
must be documented. 
5.3.2 For patients experienci ng grade 3: 
• For patients developing grade 3 neuropathy, FOLFOX -A should be held until neuropathy 
improves to grade 2 or less.  When treatment is resumed oxaliplatin and abraxane doses should be permanently decreased to dose level -1, 68mg/m2 and 120mg/m2 respectively.  
• Patients developing grade 3 or worse neuropathy investigators should not receive more than 10 
cycles of FOLFOX -A. 
• For patients developing a second episode of grade 3 neuropathy, FOLFOX-A should be held until neuropathy improves to grade 2 or less. When treatment is resumed oxaliplatin and Abraxane ®  
dose should be permanently decreased to dose level -2,  54mg/m
2 and 196mg/m2 respectively.  
• Investigators  may  hold FOLFOX -A treatment for up to six weeks secondary to patient’s 
experiencing grade 3  neuropathy, however treatment holds of greater than 6 weeks require the 
patient to come off study. Hold for neuropathy must be documented on treatment and AE forms.

 9 5.3.3 For patient experiencing grade 4 neuropathy, they will be removed from study 
For patients who experience neuropathy grade 2 or worse and thus require a dose reduction to drugs as 
per 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 and then require a dose reduction per the criteria in section 5.2, please note that patients will be reduced per the dose modification table under section 5.0 per drug.  
For example if a patient experiences grade 2 neuropathy, per section 5.3.1 Oxaliplatin will be reduced by 
20%. However if they then experience a toxicity per section 5.2 which prompts a dose reduction per the dose modification table in section 5.0, the Abraxane and 5- FU would be reduced per Dose level - 1 
(Oxaliplatin would be reduced per Dose level -2 as this patient would have experienced a dose reduction 
to Oxaliplatin per the neuropathy grade 2) . Please note that investigators can hold treatment for 6 weeks 
secondary to neuropathy and this will not count as another reason for dose reduction as per section 5.2. 
For patients who experience neuropathy grade 3, per section 5.3.2, FOLFOX -A will be held and when 
neuropathy is < grade 2, Abraxane and Oxaliplatin will be reduced by 20%  (or 1 dose level ) and 5- FU 
and Leucovorin are not reduced. However if they then subsequently experience a to xicity per section 5.2 
which prompts a dose reduction per the dose modification table in section 5.0, the 5- FU will be reduced 
per Dose level -1 and the Oxaliplatin and Abraxane will be reduced per Dose level -2. Leucovorin is not 
reduced Please note that investigators can hold treatment for 6 weeks secondary to neuropathy and this 
will not count as another reason for dose reduction, (as noted above in bullet 6 of section 5.2).   
There are no further reductions past Dose level -2. 
  5.4  Hypersensitivity reactions  
Patients with grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions from oxaliplatin or Abraxane must be removed from 
protocol treatment. Patients with grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions may be re -challenged with the use of 
additional pre -medications to prevent allergic reactions based on institutional standard practice.  
Examples of medications to r educe risk of hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin and Abraxane include:  
Dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV, 12 and 6 hours prior to the oxaliplatin or Abraxane dose; 
Dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV, as well as diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and one of the following: 
cimetidine 300 mg IV, ranitidine 50 mg IV, or famotidine 20 mg IV 30- 60 minutes  prior to oxaliplatin or 
Abraxane administration. 
 
If these prophylactic measures fail to prevent severe oxaliplatin or Abraxane related hypersensitivity, 
therapy with oxaliplatin and Abraxane should be discontinued and the patient should be removed from 
protocol treatment.  
5.5 Pulmonary Fibrosis  
In the case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as nonproductive cough, dyspnea or radiological 
pulmonary infiltrates, oxaliplatin should be discontinued until further investigation excludes interstitial 
pulmonary fibrosis.  If interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is confirmed, oxaliplatin therapy should be terminated 
and the patient removed from protocol treatment. If pulmonary fibrosis is not confirmed and the investigator 
believes the patient can continue on study, the patient will begin treatment at their next scheduled cycle at 
a 20% dose reduction. If this is their third episode of dose reduction, patient will be removed from study.

 10 5.6  Drug Interactions 
While no drug interactions have been studied, the metabolism of paclitaxel is enhanced by CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4. Therefore  patients should be informed about the potential of a drug interaction if they are also 
taking drug that induce or inhibit CYP2C8 (antifungals, erythromycin, cimetidine etc) or CYP3A4 (rifampicin, phenytoin, etc).

9.0  PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS  
9.1 Fluorouracil  
See package insert for comprehensive information.  
9.1.1  Formulation 
Each 10 ml ampule contains 500 mg of the drug (50 mg/ml), adjusted to a pH of approximately 9 with sodium hydroxide. 
5-Fluorouracil is a fluorinated pyrimidine differing from the normal RNA substrate, uracil, by a 
fluorinated number 5 carbon. The chemical has a pH of 8.1, a nd the commercially available solution 
is buffered with NaOH to obtain an alkaline solution with a pH of around 9.0. The drug is both 
light sensitive and will precipitate at low temperatures or, occasionally, after a prolonged period at room temperature. Melting range of the solid is 280- 284° C. At 25°C the solubility is 1.2 mg/ml in 
chloroform. The sodium content is 8.24 mg/ml and molecular weight 130.08. 
9.1.2  Mechanism of Action   
The metabolism of 5- FU in the anabolic pathway blocks the    methylation re action of deoxyuridylic 
acid to thymidylic acid. In this fashion, 5- FU interferes with the synthesis of DNA. This creates a 
thymine deficiency that provides unbalanced growth and cell death. Prolonged administration of 5-FU continuous infusion may favor 5-FU incorporation into RNA. 
9.1.3  Pharmacokinetics  
5-FU is rapidly absorbed by the tissues. Studies with radioactively labeled 5 -FU administered i.v., 
have indicated passage of the drug through the blood- brain barrier. Intravenous administration 
gives a half -time of 5 -7.5 minutes at a 15 mg/kg dose. Following the i.v. administration of a single 
15 mg/kg dose of radioactively labeled drug, levels of 28 mcg/ml, 2 -8 mcg/ml, and 0.72 mcg/ml in 
plasma were observed at 10 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours, respectiv ely. The drug is largely 
catabolized in the liver and excreted in the form of nontoxic metabolites. Eighty percent of the drug

 13 is excreted as CO 2 from the lungs, and approximately 15% is excreted intact in the urine in 6 hours. 
Of this, 90% is excreted in the first hour.  
9.1.4  Administration  
5-FU will be administered as a continuous IV infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks.   
9.1.5  Known Side Effects and Toxicities 
Mild nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, anorexia, diarrhea, alopecia, hand/foot syndrome, 
myelosuppression, cerebellar ataxia, skin, and cardiac toxicity have been observed. The most 
common toxicities with continuous infusion 5-FU are mucositis and hand/foot syndrome. 
9.1.6  Storage and Stability 
5-FU is stored at room temperature. 5 -FU is light  sensitive and forms precipitates at low 
temperatures.  
9.1.7  Supply 
Commercially available.  
9.2 Oxaliplatin  
Refer to the package insert for additional information.  
9.2.1 Other Names  
Eloxatin, trans -l-diamino cyclohexane oxaliplatin, cis -[oxalato(trans -l-1,2-diamino 
cyclohexane)platinum(II)]/-OHP, Eloxatine , Dacplat, SR96669. 
9.2.2 Classification  
Alkylating agent; cytotoxic  
9.2.3 Mode of Action  
The mechanism of action of oxaliplatin is similar to cisplatin. The main site of action is intra strand  
cross -linking, therefore inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. 
9.2.4 Availability  
Freeze- dried powder for IV infusion in vials containing 50 mg or 100 mg of oxaliplatin. The powder 
is a white to off -white cake or powder contained in clear glass vials, sealed with an elastomeric 
stopper and aluminum seal with a flip- off cover. The excipient is lactose monohydrate, 450 mg and 
900 mg respectively.

Reconstitute with 10 mL for 50 mg and 20 mL for 100 mg product sterile water or 5% dextrose to 
provide an initial concentration of 5 mg/mL. Subsequent dilution with 250- 500 mL 5% Dextrose.  
9.2.6 Incompatibilities  
Do not mix or administer with saline or other chloride containing solutions. Oxaliplatin is unstable in the presence of chloride. Oxaliplatin may be administered simultaneously with leucovorin by the same infusion line, provided that they are reconstituted in D5W. Do not mix 
with alkaline solutions. Oxaliplatin is unstable under alkaline conditions. Do not use components 
containi ng aluminum for the preparation of oxaliplatin administration. There is a risk of drug 
degradation when in contact with aluminum. 
9.2.7 Administration 
The diluted solution of oxaliplatin in 250-500 ml 5% dextrose is administered IV by an infusion pump over 2 hours.

ABRAXANE  is injected into a vein [intravenous (I.V.) infusion] over 30 minutes.  The use of an in- line 
liter is not recommended.  
Reconstitution and use of ABRAXANE  
1. Calculate th e patient’s body surface area at the beginning of the study and if the weight changes 
by > 10% by using the formula provided in the study manual. If this is not done it will be 
considered a minor deviation. Weight gain secondary to edema does not require d ose re-
calculation. 
2. Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by:  
• Total Dose (mg) = BSA x (study dose mg/m2 )  
3. Calculate the total number of vials required by: 
Total Number of Vials = Total Dose (mg)  
                                           100 (mg/vial) 
Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number when a fractional 
number of vials is obtained by the above formula (eg, if the total number of vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be reconstituted).  
4. Using ste rile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.  
5. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
6. Aseptically, reconstitute each ABRAXANE  vial by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 
USP.  
• Slowly  inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a minimum of 1 minute , using 
the sterile syringe directing the solution flow onto the inside wall  of the vial.  
• DO NOT INJECT  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution directly onto the lyophilized 
cake as this will result in foaming.  
• Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 (five) minutes to ensure proper 
wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.    
• Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete dissolution of any 
cake/powd er occurs.  Avoid generation of foam.  Rapid agitation or shaking will result in foaming. 
• If foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides.

 17 • Each ml of reconstituted product will contain 5 mg of paclitaxel. 
7. Calculate  the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml suspension required for the patient: 
• Dosing volume (ml) = Total dose (mg) / 5 (mg/ml) 
8. The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogeneous without visible particulates.  If 
particulates or settling are visi ble, the vial should be  gently  inverted again to ensure complete 
resuspension prior to use.  Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitates are observed.  
9. Once the exact volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE  has been withdrawn from the vials, discard any 
excess solution left over in accordance with standard operating procedures.  
10. Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE  
suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC IV bag using an injection port.  Inj ect perpendicularly 
into the center of the injection port to avoid dislodging plastic material into the IV bag.   
11. Administer the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE  suspension by IV infusion over 
30 minutes.  The use of in- line filters is no t recommended because the reconstituted solution may clog the 
filter.  
9.3.5: Supply 
Commercially available. A drug accountability log is required  
9.4 Leucovorin 
Leucovorin is a chemically reduced derivative of folic acid, and is useful as an antidote to drugs that act as 
folic acid antagonists.  It is indicated to enhance the activity of 5- fluorouracil. Leucovorin calcium for 
injection is commercially available and is supplied in sterile, single -use 350 mg vials. 
9.4.1 Supply 
Leucovorin is commercially available.  
9.4.2 Formulation and Storage 
Each 350mg vial of leucovorin calcium for injection should be reconstituted according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. This solution yields a concentration of 20 mg of leucovorin per milliliter and must be used immediately. If leucovorin calcium for injection is reconstituted with bacteriostatic water for injection, the resulting solution must be used within 7 days. Leucovorin calcium  vials for injection must be 
stored at 25 °C and protected from light.   
9.4.3 Schedule 
In the FOLFOX -A regimen leucovorin is administered in 250- 500 cc D5W over 2 hours on day 1 of each 
treatment cycle. Cycles are repeated every 14 days.  
9.5 Weight Change: 
Doses of chemotherapeutic agents do not need to be recalculated if weight change is less than 10% of total 
body weight. If this is not done it will be considered a minor deviation.  Weight gain secondary to edema

10.0 AGENT ACCOUNTABILITY 
Agent Inventory Records – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must 
maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from manufacturer using 
a Drug Accountability Re cord Form.   
10.1 Treatment Compliance  Records of study medication used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be recorded 
during the study. Drug accountability will be noted. 
All drugs will be administered to eligible patients under the  supervision of the investigator or identified 
sub-investigator(s).  The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt drug preparation, and dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers. Any discrepancy between the calculated dose and dose administe red and the reason for the discrepancy must be recorded in the source documents.  
10.2 Study Drug Disposition 
All study vials should be destroyedin accordance with the institution’s standard operating procedure for the 
destruction of a cytotoxic agent. 
 
11.0 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (ADR) REPORTING  
BrUOG considers the SAE reporting period to begin when the subject signs the study specific informed 
consent.  
 
This study will utilize the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 for grading all adverse events. All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE versio n 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 
4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).   
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical pro duct and that does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
Abra xane  whether or not considered related to Abraxane. This includes any newly occurring event or 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of drug. 
 
During clinical trials, adverse events can be spontaneously rep orted or elicited during open-ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.) 
 Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded in the case report form for the duration of the trial, regardless of 
whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial medication. All AEs considered related to trial 
medication will be followed until resolution even if this occurs post- trial.

 19 11.1 Definitions  
An adverse event  is any new, undesirable medical experience or change of an existing condition that 
occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered product- related.  
 
Serious adverse event (SAE) 
An adverse event occur ring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes (CFR 312.32): 
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization excluding  those for study drug administration, transfusional support, disease staging/re-staging procedures, concomitant 
radiotherapy, thoracentesis / paracentesis, or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated 
with other serious events. 
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
• congenital an omaly / birth defect.  
 The definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important medical event . Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other 
situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or  result in  
death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples 
of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of treatment should be considered an important 
medical event.  
 The definition of “related” being that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse experience. 
 
Unexpected adverse event  
An adverse event that is not mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure or package insert or the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the investigator's brochure or package insert.  
 Life-threatening  
Any adverse drug experience that places the patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 11.2 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation  
Adverse events, both serious and non- serious, and deaths that occur during the patient’s study 
participation will be recorded in the source documents.  All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness(es).  
 
11.3 BRUOG ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
Investigators are required by Federal Regulation to report adverse drug reactions. Question regarding drugs as used in this stu dy should be directed to the Brown University Oncology Research Group 
(BrUOG) Central Office, Phone: (401) 863-3000 Fax (401) 863-3820, which will in turn notify the Principal Investigator.  
IND 12/4/13, 12/11/13 to LOCR, 1/23/14 post IRB, Amendment #1 2/1/14, Amendment #2 3/28/14, Amendment # 3 5/22/14, Amendment 
#4 6/19/2014, Amendment # 5 9/10/14, Amendment # 6 11/21/14, Amendment # 7 2/13/15, Amendment # 8 10/5/15HS approval, Amendment # 9  11/16/15, Amendment #10 3/16/16, Amendment # 11 3/1/17, Amendment # 12 5/25/17, Amendment #13 8/21/17, 
Amendment 14 2/20/18, Amendment # 15 6-26-18, Amendment # 16 11/20/18  
 20  
Intensity for each adverse event will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE 
Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov ).  All appropriate 
treatment areas have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by the investigator or reported by the patient, must be recorded, with details about the 
duration and intensity of each episode, the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must  evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test drug and 
for its seriousness.  
All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non -serious, related or unrelated, 
will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until 30 days after the last dose of 
FOXLFOX -A, or until the subject withdraws consent from study participation (declines participation) or 
at the time patient becomes a screen failure, whichever occurs first.   
 11.3.1 Pregnancies  
Pregnancies occurring while the subject is on study drug or within 4 weeks after the subject’s last dose of study drug are considered expedited reportable events.  If the subject is on treatment  the treatment  is to 
be discontinued immediately.  The pregnancy must be reported by the Brown University Oncology Research Group within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by phone and facsimile using the SAE Form. 
 
The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must noti fy BrUOG of the 
outcome as specified below.  The Investigator will provide this information as a follow-up to the initial 
SAE. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congeni tal anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs (i.e., report the event to BrUOG by facsimile within 24 hours of the Investi gator’s 
knowledge of the event).  Any suspected fetal exposure to Abraxane must be reported to BrUOG within 24 hours of being made 
aware of the event.  The patient should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects to be related to the in 
utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported. In the case of a live “normal” birth, BrUOG 
should be advised as soon as the information is available.  
 
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male subject 
taking IP should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their 
healthcare provider immediately. 
 
11.3.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
A notification is required, prior to the submission for a ll SAEs  and pregnancy reports  or fetal exposures  to 
the Brown University Oncology Research Group.  Initial SAE information and all amendments or additions must be recorded on a MedWatch 3500A SAE form and be faxed or emailed to BrUOG within 
5 days of being made aware of the event (unless event is a pregnancy or fetal exposure which requires 
more expedited reporting) . See section 11.5 for more information

 21  
The treating investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse events to the Brown University 
Oncology Research Group’s (BrUOG) office who in return will report to the FDA, and all sites 
participating in the trial.   
 Expedited Reporting by Investigator to BrUOG  
Serious adverse events (SAE)  are defined above.  All events must be reported, by FAX or email  to the 
Brown University Oncology Research Group.  The initial report must be as complete as possible, including an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the investigati onal product(s), if 
available.  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow-up report.  A final report 
to document resolution of the SAE is required.   
 
This includes serious, related, labeled (expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse 
experiences. All deaths during treatment or within 30 days following completion of active protocol 
therapy must be reported within 5 business days or as soon as the investigator is made aware of the event.  
 
All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non -serious, related or unrelated 
will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until 30 days after the last dose of 
FOXLFOX -A, or until the subject withdraws consent from study participation (declines participation) or 
at the time patient becomes a screen failure, whichever occurs first.  This includes the period in which the  
study protocol interferes with the standard medical treatment given to a patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication). 
 
Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after st udy discontinuation need only be reported if a 
relationship to the Celgene study drug (or therapy) is suspected.  
 
11.4 Assessing Causality:  
Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that treatment caused or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidance may be used. 
 
Yes: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to treatment administration makes a  
causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
 
No:if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to treatment administration makes a  
causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
11.5 Types of Report:  
Telephone report :  For SAE’s contact BrUOG Central Office at (401) 863-3000 within 24 hours upon 
learning of the event and submit a notification to BrUOG within 24 hours prior to submitting the SAE  as 
well (see reporting requirements for pregnancy and fetal exposure above as report itself requiring within 24 hours, therefore notification required more expeditiously). 
 Written report : Send the copy of the complete and signed (by treating MD or PI) Medwatch 3500A 
within 5 business days of  being made aware of the event  (unless it is a pregnancy -see pregnancy reporting 
section)  to the BrUOG Central Office by email, scan or Fax:

 MedWatch 3500A Reporting Guidelines:  
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication information, the report 
should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 
3500A form: 
• Treatment regimen (dosing frequency, combination therapy) 
• Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
• Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcom e, if known  
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics 
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to each investigational product and suspect medication . Site must document relationship to FOLFOX and to Abraxane.  
• SAEs must be typed  
• Document BrUOG 295 
• Document action taken with treatment and study based on SAE (i.e. was treatment held, discontinued, if patient coming off study etc).  
 
Follow -up information:   
• When submitting a follow-up SAE report submit a new Medwatch3500A and briefly summarize 
initially reported information, clearly documenting what is being newly reported with the follow-
up report (i.e. new attribution to previously reported event, new event , discharge etc).  
• A follow-up report is required to report discharge from hospital 
• All elements noted under MedWatch 3500A reporting guidelines apply to follow-up reports 
 
Summarizing new information, including subject identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, subject number), protocol 
description and number, if assigned, suspect drug, brief adverse event description, and notation that 
additional or follow -up information is being submitted  (The subject identif iers are important so that the 
new information is added to the correct initial report).  11.6 BrUOG Responsibility Regarding Reporting:   
The BrUOG Central Office will notify by phone and/or fax all drug reaction reports to the FDA, the Principal Investigator, and the participating sites (who will in turn notify their local IRBs) as soon as 
possible but no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. A copy of

 12.0 REMOVAL OF PATIENTS FROM PROTOCOL THE RAPY  
Extraordinary medical circumstances or withdrawal of consent by the patient: If, at any time, the constraints 
of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health, and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol 
therapy, the patient shall be withdrawn from protocol therapy.  Patients will also be withdrawn from study for the following reasons:  
Disease Progression: Any patient with disease progression should be removed from study.  Details and tumor measurements should be documented on flow  sheets.  
1. Patient is unable to tolerate the toxicity resulting from the study treatment, even with optimal 
supportive care, in the opinion of the Treating Physician. Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the 
investigator, may cause severe or permanent h arm or which rule out continuation of study drug.  
2. The physician feels it is in the best interest of the patient to stop the treatment. 
3. Inter current illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessment of clinical 
status to a signifi cant degree or require discontinuation of study treatment 
4. Non protocol chemotherapy or immunotherapy is administered during the study 
5. Noncompliance with protocol or treatment—major violation 
6. Suspected Pregnancy  
7. Patient is lost to follow -up 
8. Patient refuses to continue treatment (patient will continue to be followed for disease -free 
survival and overall survival)

13.0 FOLLOW -UP  
All Subjects that discontinue treatme nt early for any reason as well as patients who complete therapy will 
be followed for five years. At treatment discontinuation, subjects will undergo adverse event evaluation 
and again approximately 30 days post the last dose of study drug. In addition off study evaluations will be 
done when treatment is discontinued -Section 6.0. 
14.0 REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
This research study is sponsored by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Howard Safran, in collaboration with 
Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG), which will serve as the central coordinating office for the study.  
14.1 Protection of Human Subjects  
The Investigator must ensure that patients or their legally acceptable representatives are clearly and fully 
informed about the purpose, potential risks and other critical issues regarding clinical trials in which they 
volunteer to participate.  Preparation of the consent form is the responsibility of the Investigator and must include all elements required by CFR 21 Part 50.25 and the local IRB. 
14.2 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions:  
The study must be conducted as described in this approved protocol.   
All revisions to the protocol must be provided to Brown University Oncology Research Group.  The 
Investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC of an Amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study patients.  
Documentation of approval signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB(s)/IEC(s) must be sent to Brown University Oncology Research Group.  If the revision is an Administrative Letter, Investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
The Investigator mus t ensure that patients or their legally acceptable representatives are clearly and fully 
informed about the purpose, potential risks and other critical issues regarding clinical trials in which they volunteer to participate.  Preparation of the consent for m is the responsibility of the Investigator and must 
include all elements required by CFR 21 Part 50.25 and the local IRB. 
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from either the patient 
or his/her guardian or legal representative prior to study participation.  The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH-GCP and all 
applicable regulatory requirement(s).

 25 • Any change or addition (excluding administrative) to this protocol requires a written protocol 
amendment that must be reviewed and approved by Brown University Oncology Research Group, 
and the investigator before implementation. Amendments significantly affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study require additional approval by the IRB at each study center.  A copy of the written approval of the IRB must be 
provided to Brown University Oncology Research Group . Examples of amendments requiring 
such approval  
• Increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of subjects  
• Significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group) 
• Increases in the number of invasive procedures 
• Addition or deletions of a test procedure required for monitoring of safety. 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the investigator or by Brown University Oncology Research Group in the interests of preserving the safety of 
all patients included in the trial.  If an immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by the investigator and is implemented for safety reasons Brown University Oncology Research Group must be notified a nd the IRB at the center must be informed immediately. Amendments affecting only 
administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol amendments or IRB approval but the IRB must be kept informed of such administrative changes.  
Examples of ad ministrative changes not requiring formal protocol amendments and IRB approval include: 
• Changes in the staff used to monitor trials  
• Minor changes in the packaging or labeling of study drug. 
 
15.0 DATA MONITORING / QUALITY ASSURANCE/ RECORD RETENTION 15.1 Good Clinical Practice:  The study will be conducted in accordance with the International

 26 to the protocol will require approval from BrUOG and written IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion prior 
to implementation, except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients.  The IRB/IEC may provide, if applicable regulatory authority (ies) permit, expedited review and 
approval/favorable opinion for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that have the approval /favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC.  The investigator will submit all protocol modifications to BrUOGand the 
regulatory authority (ies) in accordance with the governing regulations.  
Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source documents.   
15.4 On- site Audits:  Regulatory authorities, the IEC/I RB and/or BrUOG clinical quality assurance group 
may request access to all source documents, data capture records, and other study documentation for on-
site audit or inspection.  Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by the investigator, who 
must provide support at all times for these activities.  
15.5 Drug Accountability:  Accountability for the drug at all study sites is the responsibility of the 
principal investigator.  The investigator will ensure that the drug is used only in accordance wit h this 
protocol.  Drug accountability records indicating the drug’s delivery date to the site (if applicable), inventory at the site (if applicable), use by each patient will be maintained by the clinical site.  
Accountability records will include dates, and patient numbers.   
15.6 Premature Closure of the Study: This study may be prematurely terminated, if in the opinion of 
the investigator or BrUOG, there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Written notification documenting the 
reason for study termination wi ll be provided to the investigator by the terminating party.   
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients 
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable  rate 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements  
• Insufficient complete and/or evaluable data  
• Plans to modify, suspend or discontinue the development of the drug 
 15.7 Record Retention:  The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH -GCP and applicable regulatory

16.0 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARDS  
All trials initiated by the Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG) are subject to oversight by the Data Safety Monitorin g Board (DSMB).  This board meets two times per year with any additional 
meetings scheduled when needed.  The responsibilities are as follows:  
• Familiarize themselves with the research protocol (s)  
• The DSMB reviews trial performance information such as accrual information.   
• Review interim analyses of outcome data and cumulative toxicity data summaries to determine 
whether the trial should continue as originally designed, should be changed, or should be 
terminated based on these data.   
• The DSMB also determines whether and to whom outcome results should be released prior to the 
reporting of study results. 
• All adverse events are reviewed by the committee, with assurances that these have been in fact sent for review to all pertinent IRBs.  
• Review of reports of related studies to determine whether the monitored study needs to be changed or terminated.  
• Review major proposed modifications to the study prior to their implementation (e.g., termination, dropping an arm based on toxicity results or other reported trial outcomes, increasing 
target sample size).  
• Following each DSMB meeting, provide the study leadership with written information concerning findings for the trial as a whole related to cumulative toxicities observed and any relevant recommendations rela ted to continuing, changing, or terminating the trial.  
 
The study leadership will provide information on cumulative toxicities and relevant recommendations to 
the local principal investigators to be shared with their IRB’s.   
17.0 STATISTICS 
17.1: Feasibility of Adjuvant FOLFOX -A 
The primary goal will be to determine the feasibility of administration of adjuvant FOLFOX -A in patients 
who have undergone resection of  pancreatic cancer. Successful administration of FOLFOX -A will be 
defined as the abil ity to receive ≥8 cycles of FOLFOX -A. To address the feasibility of administering 
FOLFOX -A, the ≤65% rate of receipt of ≥8 cycles of FOLFOX -A will be considered unacceptable. 
According to Fleming’s single -stage design, the study will have 90% power to reject the null hypothesis

Agreement to Participate in a Research Study  And Authorization for Use and Disclosure of 
Information 
Adjuvant FOLFOX -A For Resected Pancreatic Cancer:  
A Phase II Brown University Oncology Research Group Trial 
 
You are being asked to take part in a research study.  All research studies carried out at <INSERT 
HOSPITAL> are covered by rules of the Federal government as well as rules of the State and <INSERT HOSPITAL> .  Under these rules, the researcher  will first explain the study, and then he or she will ask 
you to participate.  You will be asked to sign this agreement that states that the study has been explained, 
that your questions have been answered, and that you agree to participate. 
The researche r will explain the purpose of the study. He or she will explain how the study will be carried 
out and what you will be expected to do.  The researcher will also explain the possible risks and possible 
benefits of being in the study.  You should ask the researcher any questions you have about any of these 
things before you decide whether you wish to take part in the study.  This process is called informed 
consent.  
This form also explains the research study.  Please read the form and talk to the researcher ab out any 
questions you may have.  Then, if you decide to be in the study, please sign and date this form in front of 
the person who explained the study to you. You will be given a copy of this form to keep. 
Nature and Purpose of the Study      
Your doctors are participating in this research study sponsored by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Howard 
Safran, in collaboration with Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG), which will serve as the central coordinating office for the study.  
You are being a sked to take p art in this study because you recently had surgery to remove your pancreatic 
cancer. All the cancer has been removed but there is a high risk that your cancer will come back . The 
current standard of care for resected pancreatic cancer is Gemcitabine. Your doctors are studying the 
chemotherapy drug treatment FOLFOX -A (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin and Abraxane ) to see if it 
can safely be given to patients with pancreatic cancer after pancreatic surgery. Your doctors will also 
evaluate the risk of recurrence (your tumor growing back) of pancreatic cancer after completion of 
FOLFOX -A chemotherapy.  
How Many People will take part in the Study ?  
Approximately 38 patients will participate  
Explanation of Procedures   
What will happen if I take part in this research study?  
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then 
you will need the following tests, while on the study.  They are part of regular cancer care.  
• Medical history prior to starting treatment.  
IND 12/4/13, 12/11/13 to LOCR, 1/23/14 post IRB, Amendment #1 2/1/14, Amendment #2 3/28/14, Amendment # 3 5/22/14, Amendment 
#4 6/19/2014, Amendment # 5 9/10/14, Amendment # 6 11/21/14, Amendment # 7 2/13/15, Amendment # 8 10/5/15HS approval, Amendment # 9  11/16/15, Amendment #10 3/16/16, Amendment # 11 3/1/17, Amendment # 12 5/25/17, Amendment #13 8/21/17, 
Amendment 14 2/20/18, Amendment # 15 6-26-18, Amendment # 16 11/20/18  
 31 • Physical examination prior to starting treatment then every 2 weeks  
• Blood tests prior to starting treatment then every 2 weeks  
• CT scan , PET scan,  or MRI of the chest and abdomen prior to starting treatment, approximately every 
3 months while on treatment, then  approximately every  6 months during follow-up if your disease 
has not spread or grown. 
• EKG prior to starting treatment  
FOLFOX -A is administered intravenously ( IV) every 2 weeks (one treatment cycle is equal to  2 weeks). 
These drugs are given into a speci al intravenous  (in your vein) device called a port -a-cath. A port-a- cath 
is a standard  device used for chemotherapy that is implanted beneath the skin below the collarbone. A 
surgeon or radiologist will place the port-a- cath. You will sign a separate surgical consent for placement 
of the port -a-cath. This is standard of care.  
When you receive FOLFOX -A treatment, you will first be given Abraxane  over 30 minutes. The 
oxaliplatin is then administered over 2 hours. The leucovorin can either be administered a fter the 
oxaliplatin or at the same time and takes about 2 hours. The fluorouracil is then given using a small outpatient chemotherapy pump, which will last over 46 hours. Hospitalization is usually not required for the administration of these drugs. After completion of the 46 hour infusion of fluorouracil, a nurse will 
come to your home or you will return to the clinic to have the chemotherapy pump disconnected. After 
completion of the FOLFOX -A treatment  you may receive the standard drug  called  Neulasta, which is   a 
shot given beneath the skin to help reduce the risk that your white blood cells will become too low and  to reduce your risk of infection.  
How long will I be in the study?  
You will receive FOLFOX -A for up to six months (12 treatments) or as long as your cancer does not 
grow or spread and you do not have severe side effects from FOLFOX- A. After completion of FOLFOX-
A, you will be followed approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years to evaluate for pancreatic cancer 
recurrence.  If you are taken off study for disease progression, you  will also be followed approximately 
every 6 months for five years.  
Can I stop being in the study?  
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or 
decide to stop.  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from the 
discontinuation of treatment can be evaluated by your doctor.  Another reason to tell your doctor that you 
are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you.  
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your 
best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped.

• skin or tissue damage from prior radiation therapy can become damaged again, when a person 
receives chemotherapy after having had radiation therapy. This is referred to as radiation recall and 
may involve redness, peeling, pain, and swelling.  Skin changes have been noted to range from mild 
redness to tissue death. Radiation recall may also occur in the lungs and other internal organs.  
 
The following events are also possible side effects that are being noted as they have been observed by the 
Principal Inve stigator of the study:  
• Hearing loss.  
• Pain and bruising at injection sites. 
• Heart damage.  
• Kidney and liver damage.  
• Irregular heartbeat.  
• Bone, muscle and joint pains. 
• Allergic reactions or skin rash.  
• Mood changes  
• Cramps in the legs or back  
• Liver failure  
• Respiratory Failure  
Reproductive Risks  
Chemotherapy may decrease  sperm count. This is usually temporary but can be  permanent, which would 
result in sterility  (not being able to father a baby).  
 Because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby, you should not become pregnant while on this 
study. 
 If you are a woman of childbearing potential or sexually active male, you must practice an effective 
method of birth control while receiving study treatment and for at least 3 months after completing or 
discontinuing study treatment. Ask your study doctor for more information regarding preventing pregnancy during the study treatments. 
 You should not nurse your baby while on this study. If you are premenopausal, your periods are likely to 
stop temporarily and may stop permanently due to the study treatments, which may lead to symptoms of 
menopause, such as hot flashes, and the inability to become pregnant, which may be permanent. If you 
are concerned about this, ask your study doctor about options for preserving your reproductive choices, 
which may include referral to a specialist in this field.

 38 By signing this document you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the information 
presented in this Reproductive Risk section. 
Antiemetics (anti -nausea medications): Various medications used to prevent nausea and vomiting may 
cause drowsiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, headache, restlessness, agitation, anxiety, dizziness, 
involuntary tremors, skin rash, and possible allergic reaction. 
You will receive pre-medication to reduce the risk of infusion/injection reactions on your treatment days. 
Overall, the pre -medications you w ill be given are well tolerated.  
 Venipuncture (inserting a needle into a vein to obtain blood or give medication): May cause 
inflammation, pain, bruising, bleeding, or infection. 
When you receive chemotherapy by vein, there is a slight risk that some of t he drug may leak out around 
the needle at the injection site. A skin burn may result. Most skin burns are treatable and heal well.  
In order to monitor the side effects, your physician will examine you frequently and obtain laboratory 
tests (blood tests, ch est x-rays, or CT scans as needed) to determine the effects of your treatment and alter 
the drug dosages if necessary.  
Risk of CT imaging:  CT imaging uses x -rays. The radiation dose associated with this procedure is 
estimated to be a small fraction of the annual permissible dose to an x- ray technologist.  There is no 
significant risk from this amount of radiation.  
There may be other side effects that have not been reported. If you have any unusual symptoms, you 
should report them immediately to your doctor or nurse. 
 
Benefits  
While doctors hope that FOLFOX- A will help lower the risk that your pancreatic cancer will come back  
and the side effects are not too severe, this is not yet known. We do know that the information from this study will help doctors learn more about these drugs as a treatment for cancer. This information could help future cancer patients.  
Alternative Therapies  
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?  
• Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study such as receiving the chemotherapy 
drug gemcitabine or combinations of chemotherapy such as  FOLFIRINOX  or gemcitabine and  
Abraxane. 
• Receiving radiation treatments.  
• Taking part in another study 
• Getting no treatment 
• Being followed closely by CT scans and not receiving treatment.   
 Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.

 39 You decide whether or not you want to be in the study.  Participation is voluntary.  If you decide now to 
participate, you can change your mind later and quit the study.  If you decide not to participate, or if you 
quit the study, it will not affect the health care services that you normally receive.  If the researcher or 
your doctor feels it is in your best interest, they may choose to take you out of the study at any time 
before you complete the study.   
As soon as it becomes available, the researcher will give you new information about the study that may or 
may not affect your decision to stay in the research study. 
If you decide to withdraw from this study (stop taking study medication) for any reason, you will be 
asked to sign a form i ndicating whether you give your permission for your doctor and the research staff to 
continue to collect and submit follow-up information on your health status from your physicians and 
medical record. After signing the form, you still have the right to change your mind, at any time, regarding follow- up after withdrawal.  
Medical Treatment/Payment in Case of Injury  
A research injury is any physical or mental injury or illness caused by being in the study. If you are 
injured by a medical treatment or procedure you would have received even if you were not in the 
study that is not a research injury. To help avoid research injury and added medical expenses, it is very important to follow all study directions carefully. If you do experience a research injury, 
<INSERT HOSPITAL>  or the study doctor can arrange medical treatment for you. Such treatment 
will be paid for as described below.  
 
Medical treatment will be available if you suffer a research related injury; however, you and/or your health insurance company will be charged for this treatment. The study will not pay for this medical treatment. Neither Dr. Howard Safran nor BrUOG, the coordinating center, have money set aside to reimburse you for medical bills from treatment of a research related injury or otherwise compensate 
you in the event of a study-related injury.  
 
If you have insurance and have a research injury that is not covered by the study, it is possible that some or all of the cost of treating you could be billed to your insurer. If your health insurance will not cover such costs, it is possible you would have to pay out of pocket. In some cases,
 <INSERT 
HOSPITAL> might be able to help you pay if you qualify for free care under <INSERT HOSPITAL>  
policy. However, <INSERT HOSPITAL>  has no policy to cover payment for such things as lost 
wages, expenses other than medical care, or pain and suffering.

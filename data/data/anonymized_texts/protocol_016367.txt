STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Analysis Populations:  
Enrolled:  The Enrolled Population will consist of all subjects who signed the informed consent to 
participate in the study, and had Screening visit electronic case report form s (eCRFs) collected.  
Randomized:  The Randomized Population will consist of all Enrolled su bjects who w ere randomized at 
Baseline/Visit 2  (Day 1) 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT):  The ITT Population will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
dose of study medication.  
Per-Protocol (PP) : The PP Population will include all ITT subjects who had adequate exposure to the 
randomiz ed study medication (>85%) during the 24 -week period as defined in the final statistical analysis 
plan, have completed all study visits  and have adequately complied with the protocol as assessed by the 
investigator and sponsor prior to database lock.  The final definition of the PP Population will be 
documented in an addendum to the prospectively developed statistical analysis plan (SAP) prior to 
unblinding any data. 
 
Analysis Endpoints : 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:   The primary efficacy endpoint is percentage change from Baseline/Visit 2 
(Day1) to Study Termination/Visit 8  (Day 168/Week 24) in body weight  
Primary Safety and Tolerability Endpoint:   The primary safety and tolerability endpoint is the incidence 
of all treatment -emergent adverse events.  
 Statistical Analyses:  
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, SE, median, min, and max) will be used to summarize values of the 
primary efficacy endpoint, change in percent body weight  from Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1 ) to Study 
Termination/Visit 8 (Day 16 8/Week 24 ) and intermediate study visits as applicable by treatment group.  
These summaries will be presented for the PP Population with observed data and the ITT Population with 
Last Observation Carried Forward  (LOCF) approach.   A mixed-model of analysis of variance (ANCOVA) 
will be used to analyze change in body weight over the study duration in PP and ITT Populations.  The 
ANCOVA will include treatment group and time as the main effects with baseline weight as the covariate.   
The LS means, SEs, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) for the changes from b aseline to 
Week 24 will be derived from the model for each treatment.  Each of the fixed- dose combinations of 
leucine, sildenafil, and /or metformin  treatment groups (Treatment B, C, D and E) will be compared  to 
placebo group (Treatment A), and the LS means for the treatment difference (Treatment B, C D or E  minus 
Treatment A), the SEs, the associated 95% C Is, and the p -values will be computed.  
 SAMPLE SIZE 
 
A sufficient number of individuals will be screened to enroll at least 250 subjects (~50/treatment arm).  With an assumption of 20% dropout rate, approximately 200 subjects (~40/treatment arm) are expected to complete treatment through Study Termination/Vi sit 8 (Day 168/Week 24).   
Using a two -sided, two -sample comparison (t -test) of means at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, sample 
sizes of 23 subjects per treatment will provide approximately 90% power to detect a mean treatment difference of 3 kg body  weight (~3.0- 3.3% weight loss over 24 weeks), assuming a common standard 
deviation of 25%.  However, detection of significant changes in obesity co -morbidities require a higher 
sample size; detection of a 6 mm Hg change in blood pressure will require a sample size of 40 subjects per treatment group at 80% power; accordingly, the sample size has been increased to 40/treatment arm to enable assessment of this secondary endpoint. These assumptions of effect size and standard deviation are based on data derived from the previous clinical trial of NS -0200 (NS -0200-01) and represent  the 
anticipated treatment effect of effective fixed -dose combinations of leucine and sildenafil, with or without 
metformin, compared to placebo .

1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
 
Global obesity prevalence has doubled over the past three decades, and the obesity epidemic 
now represents a significant public health risk in the US and other developed countries as well as in the developing world.  In the US, >35% of the adult population and 17% of the pediatric and adolescent populations are obese, and ~70% of the population is overweight or obese [1,2]. 
Obesity is associated with significant mortality risk, as shown by a 9 -13 year reduction in 
lifespan and >300,000 obesity- related deaths annually in the US  [3–7].  Further, obesity 
increases the risk of co -morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and some cancers  [4–8].  The risk of 
obesity-related co -morbidities increases with increasing body mass index (BMI); conversely, 
even modest reduction in BMI resulting from a 5-10% weight loss reduces the risk and severity of these co -morbidities  [9,10]. 
 Lifestyle intervention focused on reducing caloric intake and increasing caloric expenditure are the first -line approach to obesity management; however, patient adherence is generally 
poor and obesity control through lifestyle intervention alone rarely exhibits sustained success.  Accordingly, pharmacotherapy is an important adjunct to diet and exercise to achieve sustained weight reduction.  The proposed fixed dose combination of the amino acid leucine and two well characterized agents with established good safety profiles is expected to modulate energy metabolism and facilitate sustained weight loss.  
 AMPK and Sirt1 are well known regulators of lipid and energy metabolism. Activation of Sirt1 and AMPK stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation with concomitant suppression of lipid synthesis and storage [11–16]. NuSirt Biopharma has demonstrated that L-leucine has a unique role as an activator of the Sirt1/AMPK pathway, serving as a partial 
mimetic of caloric restriction, and thereby modulates Sirt1 -dependent lipid and energy 
metabolism [17–19] . NuSirt has shown that addition of L-leucine to metformin (fixed dose 
combination, NS-0100) results in a novel synergistic interaction that enables significant dose reduction of metformin with no loss of anti- diabetic efficacy  (IND# 121112) and that a triple 
combination of L- leucine with low -dose metformin and sildenafil (NS-0200) regresses 
steatohepatitis in preclinical studies  [19,20] and reduces hepatic fat in non- alcoholic fatty liver 
disease patients with elevated liver enzymes (IND #126214). Further, data from the Phase 2A trial conducted under this IND also provided a robust weight loss signal accompanied by decreases in obesity associated co -morbidities.  This finding is supported by both mechanism 
of action and preclinical studies demonstrating reductions in adiposity in a rodent obesity model.  NuSirt also has preclinical data which suggests that metformin may not be a necessary component to achieve weight loss; we therefore will evaluate a related fixed dose combination of leucine and sildenafil in the absence of metformin (NS-0300) in this study.  The superior combination will then be utilized for f urther development.   
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this  study is: 
• To evaluate the percentage change in weight  in subjects from : Baseline/Visit 2 
(Day 1) to Study Termination/Visit 8  (Day 168/Week 24) receiving two fixed -dose 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 12  
combinations of leucine and sildenafil or t wo fixed-dose combinations of leucine, 
sildenafil and metformin  compared to placebo  
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary  objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of two fixed -dose 
combinations of leucine and sildenafil or t wo fixed-dose combinations of leucine, 
sildenafil and metformin  compared to placebo  in obese on the following  parameters:  
• Absolute body weight from Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1) to Study Termination/Visit 8  
(Day 168/Week 24)

4.4 Removal of Subjects from Study Participation  
Participants  are to be removed from the study if any of the following conditions are met after 
study entry: 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 17  
 
• Withdrawal  of Consent - Subject wishes to withdraw from the study as outlined in the 
informed consent. All subjects reserved the right to withdraw from the study without  
prejudice to themselv es or their future medical care. This implies a direct request to 
withdraw from the study and a refusal of further contact.  
• Adverse Event - Subject experiences  an adverse event, which in the investigator’s  
opinion necessitates  withdrawal  from the study.   
• Investigator Decision - Investigator  assessment  that it is in the subject’s best interest 
to terminate participation.  
• Protocol Violation – Includes subject non-compliance,  documented pregnancy,  study 
entry violation, and/or start of an unacceptable concomitant medication  (listed in 
section 4.3). 
• Lost To Follow-Up - Subject fails to return for study visits and cannot be reached 
with reasonable attempts.  At the close of the study one final attempt to contact 
the subject will be made to attempt to determine the subjects well -being. 
• Administrative  Reason – Includes discontinuation  of the study protocol by the 
sponsor, the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA), or other regulatory  
authority,  and/or discontinuation of the study site’s participation  in the study 
protocol. 
• Pregnancy  
Any withdrawal  from the study will be fully documented  on the subject’s eCRF and in the 
subject’s study record at the site. The documentation will include reasons for the withdrawal  
and details of any sequelae (followed  through until the symptoms  resolved or returned to 
baseline levels) if the reason was an adverse event. 
Every effort will be made to conduct all protocol specified  procedures  and examinations  
required to  complete the study. Optimally,  all procedures should be performed  within 24 
to 48 hours of termination  and, if possible, prior to initiating new therapies.   Diligent 
attempts will be made to follow through endpoint assessment those patients who do not 
withdraw consent and/or are not lost to follow up.  
Subjects who discontinue from the study after randomization  and prior to completion  of 
Study Termination  /Visit 8 will be considered  early withdrawals  and, if enrollment  is still 
open, enrollment m ay be expanded  to ensure a full complement of evaluable subjects. 
 
4.5 Subject Restrictions  
Once screened and qualified for entry, subjects will be instructed  as follows: 
• Take no new prescription or over-the-counter medications  without prior 
notification of the investigator.  For restrictions  on concomitant  medications,  refer 
to Section 4.3   
• Remain on their usual diet and exercise regimen throughout the study  
  
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 18  
• Fast overnight for at least 10 hours (no food or beverage except  water) prior to each 
visit 
• Do not donate blood for the duration of the study 
The sponsor should be contacted  if the investigator is informed of any restriction  violations.  
The sponsor will decide whether a subject with restriction  violations  will be granted a 
deviation and allowed to continue study participation. 
 
4.6  Concomitant  Medications  
Subjects must follow the medication  restrictions  outlined in the inclusion and exclusion  
criteria (Section 4.3) during the study. Dosages for certain concomitant medications  should 
be maintained  constant during the study (Section 4.2 and 4.3) unless instructed  otherwise  by 
the investigator or a treating physician.  Any change in regimen for any concomitant 
medication,  including restricted concomitant medications,  must be reported to the sponsor 
and recorded in  the eCRF. 
The sponsor should be contacted  if the investigator  is informed of consistent  concomitant  
medication  restriction  violations.  The sponsor will decide whether the subject will be allowed 
to continue study participation.  
 
5 STUDY MEDICATIONS  
Study medications  administered  in this protocol include either placebo or one of four  
combinations of leucine, sildenafil  and/or metformin (See Section 5.1) .  All drugs will be 
provided as tablets with identical appearance to double-blind the medications  to subjects 
and study personnel.  Study medication is to be kept at ambient temperature at all times.  
Any deviations will require the drug to be temporarily quarantined and the deviation 
reported to NuSirt.  NuSirt will then make an assessment as to how to proceed. 
 
5.1 Formulation, Packagi ng, and Storage  
Fixed Dose Combination  Arms: Each dose of study medicatio n will consist of three tablets , 
two tablets containing either 550 mg L -leucine alone or 550mg L -leucine in combination with 
250 mg of Metformin an d one tablet either 1.0 mg or 4.0 mg of sildenafil.  
Placebo Arm: Each dose of placebo will consist of three tablets , identical in appearance 
to those used in the two active treatment arms, containing 93.5% Microcrystalline cellulose PH 102, 5.0% Crospovidone XL 10, 1.0% Silica gel (Syloid 244), 0.5% Magnesium stearate I MF3V for the leucine matched placebo and 99.5% Avicel PH200 , 0.5% magnesium stearate (w/w) and Opadry II White coating 3% weight gain for the 
sildenafil matched placebo.  
 
5.2 Dispensing  of Study Medication  
Study materials will be provided to subjects by the investigator, medically  qualified sub- 
investigator named on form FDA 1572, or other qualified study-site personnel. Under no 
circumstance will the investigator  or sub-investigator(s) allow the study medication  to be 
used other than as directed by the protocol or to be administered  to any persons other than 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 19  
subjects who have signed an informed consent and are participating  in the study. 
Study-site personnel will be responsible  for instructing  subjects to administer  the correct 
doses of study medication  as shown in Appendix  1. 
Study medication  will be provided in blinded, randomized kits. Each kit dispensed will be 
labeled with a unique package number. 
 
5.3 Dose Administration,  Route and Schedule  
Study medication  will be self-administered  by the patient as 3 tablets taken orally BID within 
30 minutes prior to the morning and evening meals. Each dose of study medication  will 
consist of 3 tablets, which will be identical in appearance across all treatment groups.  
 
5.4 Randomization Schedule  and Blinding Procedures  
A randomization  schedule will be prepared and not shared with anyone directly involved in 
study conduct. Subjects will be assigned to one of five treatment groups ( Table 1) based 
on the randomization schedule. 
Subjects will be assigned a randomization number on Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1) . The 
randomization  numbers will be allocated in strict chronological order. The number will 
uniquely identify the subject and dictate the assigned, blinded treatment group. 
The sponsor  personnel involved in study conduct, study staff and subject will be blinded to 
the identity of study medication  during the study. The study medication  will be provided to 
the study centers in a blinded fashion. The study center pharmacist  will use the subject’s 
assigned randomization number to ensure that the appropriate blinded study medication  is 
allocated at each visit. The study centers will  be provided with sufficient study medication  to 
supply all randomized subjects.  
 
5.5 Drug Accountability  
The investigator listed on form FDA 1572 will be responsible for all clinical supplies 
(study medication) accountability. Upon receipt of all study medication, the contents of 
each shipment will be verified against the enclosed shipping form. After verification, the 
form will be signed and dated, a copy will be retained for the investigator’s file, and the 
original will be returned to the sponsor. The sponsor will be notified immediately if any irregularities, discrepancies, or damages are identified.  
The investigational materials will be prescribed only by the investigator or sub -
investigators. Under no circumstances will the investigator or sub -investigators allow the 
investigational drug to be used other than as specified in the protocol. 
Drug dispensing and returns will be recorded on a sponsor-provided or sponsor-approved 
drug disposition form, to provide a complete accounting of the receipt, disposition, and 
return of study medication. At the completion of the study, all remaining used and unused study medication, empty containers, and copies of the completed drug disposition forms will be returned to the sponsor or designee.

6.15 Ethical Safety Considerations  
 
Metformin, on rare occasions, has been associated with lactic acidosis in patients on higher 
doses than allowed in this study.  In addition, these events have usually occurred in patients encountering major medical illnesses superimposed on their diabetes.  These issues are addressed in Section 8.1 with an emphasis on early detection.  
 
Treatment with sildenafil at the approved doses of 50 to 100 mg (≥20 times the doses employed 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 26  
in this study) has been associated with the following rare adverse events:  
 
1. Sudden loss of vision 
2. Ringing in the ears 
3. Loss of hearing  
4. Ischemic cardiovascular events  
 
Should any study participant experience one of these events, study drug is to be held, 
appropriate medical evaluation arranged and the medical monitor contacted.  It will then be the determination of the medical monitor, after discu ssions with the PI, whether the subject will be 
removed from the study.  
 
7 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
 
7.1 Percent Change in Body Weight  
Body weight will be assessed at Screening/Visit 1 (Day -7/Week-1), Baseline/Visit 2 
(Day1), Visit 3 (Day 28/Week4), Visit 4 (Day 56/Week 8), Visit 5 (Day 84/Week 12), 
Visit 6 (Day 112/Week 16), Visit 7 (Day 140/Week 20) and Study Termination/ Visit 8 
(Day 168/Week 24) or Early Termination .  Percentage change is defined as Study 
Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24) or Early Termination weight  minus Baseline/Visit 
2 (Day1) weight divided by Baseline/Visit 2 (Day1) weight multiplied by 100 .  Weight 
measurements  will be done without  shoes or street clothing ; subjects will be weigh ed in 
undergarments with gowns (front and back) . All scales will have certified calibration  and 
sites will maintain their cur rent calibaration schedule.  When possible the  same scale that is 
used for a subject at Screening/Visit 1 (Day -7/Week-1) will be used for all remaining visits 
for that subject.  All weights are to be made and reported in kilograms to the first decimal 
place. 
 
7.2 Absolute Body Weight

Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 27  
 
7.4 Waist Circumference  
Waist circumference will be measured at  Baseline/Visit 2 (Day1), Visit 3 (Day 28/Week4), 
Visit 4 (Day 56/Week 8), Visit 5 (Day 84/Week 12), Visit 6 (Day 112/Week 16), Visit 7 
(Day 140/ Week 20) and Study Termination/ Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24) or Early 
Terminatio n.  Waist circumference is measured at the end of several consecutive natural 
breaths, at a level parallel to the floor, midpoint between the top of the iliac cres t and the 
lower margin of the last palpable rib in the mid axillary line.  Measurement s are made with 
a stretc h‐resistant tape (which will be provided by NuSirt) that is wrapped snugly around 
the subject, but not to the point that the tape is constricting.   The tape is kept level and 
parallel to the floor at the point of measurement.  Subjects will be  standing upright during 
the measurement, with arms relaxe d at the side, feet evenly spread apart and body weight 
evenly distributed.  All measurements are to be made and reported in centimeters  to the 
first decimal place .  
 
7.5 Fasting Lipids  
Fasting lipid concentrations (total cholesterol,  LDL, HDL, triglycerides) will be 
measured in all subjects from blood samples collected at Screening/Visit 1 (Day -
7/Week-1), Baseline/Visit 2 (Day1), Visit 5 (Day 84/Week 12) and Study 
Termination/Visit 8  (Day 168/Week 24) or Early Termination . 
 
7.6 Fasting Glucose  
Fasting glucose will be measured in all subjects from blood samples collected at 
Screening/Visit 1 (Day -7/Week-1), Baseline/Visit 2 (Day1), Visit 5 (Day 84/Week 12) and

(Day-7/Week-1), Baseline/Visit 2 (Day1), Visit 5 (Day 84/Week 12) and Study 
Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24) or Early Termination.  
 
7.8 Blood Pressure  
Blood Pressure will be measured in all subjects at Screening/Visit 1 (Day -7/Week-1), 
Baseline/Visit 2 (Day1), Visit 3 (Day 28/Week4), Visit 4 (Da y 56/Week 8), Visit 5 (Day 
84/Week 12), Visit 6 (Day 112/Week 16), Visit 7 (Day 140/Week 20) and Study 
Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24) or Early Termination. Blood pressure will be taken 
using the Omron HEM-907XL provided by NuSirt. Q ualified site personnel will program  
the machine to capture a series of 3 measurements  starting with a  5 minute delay followed 
by a delay of 2 minutes between the first and second reading and the second and third 
reading. The patient is to be in a s eated position with their back resting on the back of the 
chair, feet flat on the floor  and arm resting comfortably approximate ly at heart level .  The 
appropriate cuff size, cuff placement and wrapping of the cuff on the subjects arm will be 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 28  
applied following the instruction manual provided with the equipment.  Once the patient and 
equipment is set, site personnel will leave the room for approximately 10 minutes.  After the 
measurements are completed, qualified site personnel will then document the 3 
measurements , as well as the average provided by the machine (refer to the Omron HEM -
907XL instruction manual for detailed instructions on all the directions listed above). 
 
7.9 hsC-Reactive Protein  
hsC-Reactive Protein will be measur ed in all subjects from blood samples collected at 
Baseline/Visit 2 (Day1), Visit 5 (Day 84/Week 12) and Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 
168/Week 24) or Early Termination. 
 
7.10 Biomarkers  
  Biomarkers will be measured in all subjects from blood samples collected at Baseline/Visit 2 
(Day1), Visit 5 (Day 84/Week 12) and  Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 16 8/Week 24) or 
Early Termination. Biomarker analysis will not include genetic testing. Biomarker analysis 
may include but is not limited to assessments of ad iponectin, TNFα , IL-6, PAI-1, and a 
lipidomic panel. Additional non- genetic biomarkers identified subsequent to trial initiation 
may also be used. 
 
8 SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study by examination  of adverse events, concomitan t 
medications,  clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, physical examinations,  and 12-lead 
ECGs. Safety assessments  by visit are  listed in Appendix 1. 
8.1 Targeted Safety Surveillance Items  
This study represents the second evaluation of the concomitant administration of leucine, 
sildenafil and metformin in combination  and the initial evaluation of the concomitant 
administration of leucine and sildenafil  in combination.  Given that leucine is a naturally 
occurring amino acid  that is regularly ingested as part of normal dietary practices, the well -
established safety profiles of sildenafil and metformin when administered at higher doses and 
the observed safety of the drug combination in preclinical studies to date, the assessed risk is 
low.  However,  the fact that this represents the second  systematic  administration of the 
leucine, sildenafil and metformin combination and the initial systemic administration of the 
leucine and sildenafil combination to humans, constant attention to safety monitoring is 
warranted.  The following issues need careful attention throughout the course of the study. 
 
8.1.1 Metformin Associated Lactic Acidosis  
Although its occurrence is extremely rare, lactic acidosis has been reported in patients using full do se metformin (1 500 to 2500 mg/day).  Given that lactic 
acidosis is a serious condition and the possibility that the leucine- metformin -
sildenafil combination might potentiate this effect, study staff need to have a 
heightened awareness of this possibility.   
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 29  
The initial signs and symptoms associated with lactic acidosis are subtle , vague 
and non-specific including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
lethargy and, with advancing severity, hyperventilation and hypotension.  Since 
plasma lactate levels are erratic and of little help until the severity of the 
disorder has advanced, it is important to be attentive to the electrolyte measurements on the chemistry panel and investigate further any anion gap that is noted.  Also, study staff should be attentive to patient reports  and implement 
appropriate clinical evaluation of persistent complaints of lethargy and fatigue.  
If in doubt, contact the medical monitor. Study medication should be stopped immediately if any evidence of lactic acidiosis is seen.  
Also, since intravascular volume depletion can increase the risk for lactic 
acidosis, the study medication should be discontinued prior to any procedures, surgical or otherwise, that require restricted fluid intake.  
8.1.2 Nephrotoxic Effects of Radiocontrast Age nts in Patients Taking 
Metformin  
The administration of iodinated radiocontrast agents has been associated with 
acute nephrotoxic effects when administered to patients taking metformin.  
Thus, it is recommended that study medication be discontinued for 24 hours 
prior to the patient receiving any iodinated radiocontrast material.  Study medication should then be resumed once the patient has returned to their usual 
diet and fluid intake.  
8.1.3 Risk of Hypoglycemia in Patients Taking Metformin 
While metformin is a gl ucose lowering agent, it is unusual for patients taking 
only metformin to experience hypoglycemia.  (Hypoglycemia associated with 
metformin use is seen almost exclusively when used in combination with a 
sulfonylur ea or insulin.)  However, since  the experie nce is limited with  leucine, 
metformin and sil denafil administered together, it is possible that the risk of 
hypoglycemia could be observed.  Therefore, patients will be instructed 
regarding the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and advised to ingest carbohydrate should they encounter the symptoms of hypogly cemia as well as 
to notify the study site. Study medication should be stopped immediately if any 
evidence of hypoglycemia is seen.  
8.1.4 Hypotension  
Sildenafil , at doses as low as 5mg TID, has been shown to cause hypotension. 
Although rare, if any signs of hypotension are present , in addition to reporting 
as an adverse event, please notify the medical monitor within 24 hours. Study medication should be stopped immediately if a ny evidence of hypotension is 
seen. 
8.1.5 Changes in Vision  
Sildenafil, at doses of 50 to 100 mg, has been associated with sudden loss of 
vision.  In addition, patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for 
developing macular edema.   While it is unlikely that macular edema will be an 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 30  
issue in this study of only 24- weeks duration .  Should a patient report blurry 
vision and/or a change in color vision, they should be referred for evaluation to 
an ophthalmologist. 
Sildenafil, at doses of 50 to 100mg, has been associated with non- arteritic 
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy . Although rare, if any signs of non- arteritic 
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy  are present ,  in addition to reporting as an 
adverse event, please notify the medical monitor within 24 hours. Study 
medication should be stopped immediately if any evidence of non- arteritic 
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is seen.  
8.1.6 Leucine Toxicity  
Leucine, when consumed as a dietary supplement at high doses (>500 
mg/kg/day), has been associated with an increase in blood ammonia levels.  While it’s unlikely that the doses employed in this trial are adequate to elevate 
blood ammonia levels, the potential for synergism between leucine, metformin 
and sildenafil exists.  Also, the potential exists for the combination to magnify the hypoglycemic effects of metformin.  
Therefore, any study participant presenting with neurological symptoms should 
be evaluated for low blood glucose val ues and elevated ammonia levels.  If 
either are found, in addition to reporting as an adverse event, please notify the 
medical monitor within 24 hours. Study medication should be stopped immediately if any evidence of leucine toxicity is seen.  
8.2 Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reported in accordance with the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.  (Appendix 2).  The 
CTCAE grades the severity of the AE based upon Grades 1 through 5 and lists unique 
clinical descriptions of severity for each AE. 
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL.  
Grade 3:   Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL  
Grade 4:   Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5:   Death related to AE  
In the event of the occurrence of a same category of three or more grade III CTCAE or 2 -
grade IV CTCAE or one grade V CT CAE, the trial will be paused, evaluated for safety by 
the Medical Monitor and allowed to proceed only after the Medical Monitor  determines  the 
causality is not associated with the investigational fixed -drug combination.

Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 31  
8.3 Adverse Events and Subject  Withdrawals  
Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence associated  with the use of a therapy in humans, whether 
or not considered treatment  related. 
 
Life-Threatening  
Any untoward medical occurrence that places the patient or subject at immediate  risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected  adverse reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
ANY SAE THAT OCCURS  AFTER THE SIGNING  OF THE ICF THROUGH 30 
DAYS AFTER ADMINISTRATION  OF THE LAST DOSE OF STUDY 
MEDICATION  MUST BE REPORTED  IMMEDIATELY  (WITHIN  24 HOURS OF 
KNOWLEDGE)  TO THE SPONSOR’S MEDICAL  MONITOR  (858-342-7057). FAX 
THE SAE REPORT  FORM TO THE NUMBER LISTED ON THE FORM 
An adverse event is considered "Serious"  if, in the view of either the investigator  or sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• A life-threatening  adverse event 
• Inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant  incapacity  or substantial disruption  of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment,  
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention  to 
prevent one of the outcomes  listed in this definition.  
Any SAE, unexpected  events or death encountered  during the course of the investigation and 
for a reasonable time thereafter will be reported to the principal and/or co -investigators by 
the subject (immediately  by telephone and subsequently in writing within five (5) days). The 
investigator will immediately  report the SAE/unexpected event or death within 24 hours of 
being notified to the sponsor for review and assessment/causality  confirmation, and to the 
IRB (per FDA requirements).  
 
Unexpected  Adverse Event:  
An adverse event is considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or 
is not listed at the specificity  or severity that has been observed. 
FDA guidelines recognize that: 
1. “Individual adverse event reports generally require an evaluation  of their relevance and 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 32  
significance  to the study, including an evaluation of other adverse events, before they can 
be considered  to be an unanticipated  problem,” and 
2. “All reports to the IRB of unanticipated  problems should explain clearly why the event 
described  represents  a ‘problem’ for the study and why it is ‘unanticipated.’’ 
Investigators are required to report unexpected adverse events that fit the following criteria 
within 10 working days of the time the investigator  has become informed of the event(s) to 
the IRB and sponsor. 
The following guidelines  provide further definition  to unexpected  adverse events: 
• Event is unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures  that are described  in the protocol- related documents,  such as the IRB- 
approved research protocol and informed consent document,  or the investigator 
brochure; and (b) the characteristics  of the subject population being studied, 
• Related or possibly related to participation  in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility  that the incident, experience,  or outcome may have 
been caused by the procedures involved in the research);  and 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic,  or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
If the adverse event is clearly not related  to the study drug, device, procedures,  or washout  
process, it would not represent a risk to other subjects in the research or a “problem” for the 
study and, therefore,  does not have to be reported to the IRB. 
 
Intensity:  
The intensity of each adverse event will be characterized  as mild, moderate, or severe, as 
follows: 
• MILD: Usually transient, requires no special treatment,  and does not interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities.  
• MODERATE:  Usually causes a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject 
and may interfere with daily activities,  but is usually ameliorated  by simple 
therapeutic  measures.  
• SEVERE:  Interrupts  a subject’s usual daily activities and generally requires 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment.  
Causality: 
The investigator  will grade the association  of the adverse event as UNRELATED  or 
RELATED  to study medication.  The following criteria should be considered  for determining  
relatedness:  
• UNRELATED:  The adverse event is judged to be produced by the subject's clinical 
state or by other therapies administered  to the subject. 
• RELATED:  The adverse event is judged to be related to the administration  of study 
medication.  
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 33  
Pregnancy : 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the study or within 30 days of discontinuing study drug, 
the Investigator should report the pregnancy to the NuSirt Medical Monitor  within 24 hours 
of being notified. The NuSirt Medical Monitor will then forward the Exp osure In Utero form 
to the Investigator for completion. A patient becoming pregnant while on study drug will 
immediately be withdrawn from the study and Early Termination study procedures will be performed. A patient who becomes pregnant should be fol lowed by the Investigator until 
completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify NuSirt Medical Monitor . At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator should document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome 
of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum 
complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly) the 
Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  If a pregnancy occurs during the study , the data is to be gathered regardless of the conclusion of the study and 
provided to NuSirt immediately after collection.  
 
8.4 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
The investigator  or medically  qualified physician  listed on the form FDA 1572 will evaluate 
all screening  and safety laboratory reports, and will sign and date the review. Any out of 
range laboratory results should be assessed for clinical significance.  The investigator  should 
follow all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring  during the study that were 
not present at baseline. These abnormalities should be evaluated  with additional tests, if 
necessary,  until the underlying cause is diagnosed or resolution  occurs. The diagnosis and 
resolution  date must be reported to the sponsor. Samples will be collected according  to the 
schedules  presented  in Appendix  1 and Section 6. 
The centralized  laboratory will provide specific instructions for collection,  processing,  
packaging,  and shipping of all samples.

hysterectomy),  pregnancy tests will be performed  from blood samples collected at 
Screening/Visit 1 (Day-7/Week-1). 
 
8.5.2 Urine Drug Screen 
A urine screen for drugs of abuse and alcohol  will be performed  from a urine sample 
collected at Screening/Visit 1 (Day -7/Week-1). Positive results due to prescription  
medications  (e.g., opioid-containing pain medications)  are not necessarily  
exclusionary  as long as it can be documented that they have a prescription.   
 
8.6 Vital Signs, Physical Examination Findings,  and ECGs 
Clinically  significant  ab normalities  in vital signs, physical examination  findings, and ECGs 
at Study Termination  must be followed up by the investigator and evaluated  with additional

Standard 12- Lead ECGs will  be performed  at Screening/Visit 1 (Day -7/Week-1) and 
Study Termination/Visit 8  (Day 168/Week 24) or Early Termination . 
Standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed  after at minimum 5 minutes of quiet rest with 
the subject in a supine position. If the ECG must be performed  with the subject in another 
position (sitting, standing, etc.), the investigator  should record the alternate position on the  
ECG eCRF page. This data also needs to be in the medical record. The investigator  should 
date and sign the ECG tracing and record the clinical significance of any abnormal result 
on the tracing. ECGs will be interpreted  by a qualified physician  (the investigator or 
qualified designee)  at the clinical study site. 
 
9 BLOOD VOLUME  
During this study, blood w ill be drawn for various analytes  and panels, including chemistry,  
lipids, hematology, and efficacy assessments.  The total amount of blood to be drawn 
(during the  entire study) is expected to be <90mL or ~3 ounces for each subject. 
 
10 DISCONTINUING  AND UNBLINDING  OF SUBJECTS  
Every effort should be made to conduct all protocol- required procedures  to complete the 
study. Subjects may be removed from the study for the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal  of Consent - Subject wishes to withdraw from the study as outlined in the 
informed consent. All subjects reserved the right to withdraw from the study without  
prejudice to themselves or their future medical care. 
• Adverse Event - Subject experiences  an adverse event which, in the investigator’s  
opinion, necessitates  withdrawal  from the study.   
• Investigator Decision - Investigator  assessment  that it is in the subject’s best interest 
is to terminate participation.  
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 36  
• Protocol Violation – Includes subject non-compliance,  documented pregnancy,  study 
entry violation, and/or start of an unacceptable concomitant medication.  
• Lost To Follow-Up - Subject fails to return for study visits and cannot be reached 
with reasonable attempts. 
• Administrative  Reason – Includes discontinuation  of the study protocol by the 
sponsor, the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA), or other regulatory  
authority,  and/or discontinuation  of the study site’ participation in the study 
protocol. 
• Pregnancy  
 
Any withdrawal from the study will be fully documented on the subject’s eCRF and in 
the subject’s study record at the site. The documentation will include reasons for the 
withdrawal and details of any sequela e (followed through until the symptoms resolved or 
returned to baseline levels) if the reason was an adverse event.  
Every effort will be made to conduct all protocol specified procedures and examinations 
required to complete the study. Optimally, all procedures should be performed within 24 to 48 hours of termination and, if possible, prior to initiating new therapies.  Diligent attempts will be made to follow through endpoint assessment those patients who do not withdraw consent and/or are not lost to follow up. 
Only withdrawls for withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up will not continue to be 
followed. For all other patients – regardless of whether or not study drug is discontinued – 
every effort should be made to continue all visits in the study for safety and should be 
encouraged to complete all study procedures.Subjects who discontinue from the study after randomization and prior to completion of Study Termination /Visit 8 will be considered early withdrawals and, if enrollment is still open, enrollm ent may be expanded 
to ensure a full complement of evaluable subjects. 
 
10.1 Unblinding  of Subjects 
The subject, investigator  (including all study-site personnel),  and sponsor will be blinded to 
the identity of the assigned study medication  during the 24- week treatment period (Visit 2 
to Visit 8). Every effort should be made to ensure that subjects remain blinded to their 
treatment.  The investigator  is to notify the sponsor’s medical monitor if an event occurs 
that requires a subject’s treatment assignment  to be unblinded. The code may be unblinded 
only after an irrevocable  decision has been made to withdraw a subject from the study and 
if immediate  knowledge of the study medication  is needed to optimize the clinical 
management  of the subject. 
  
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 37  
 
11 DATA MANAGEMENT  
A designated contract research organization (CRO) will perform all data management  
activities, including the writing of a data management plan , outlining the data management 
system and procedures to be used. The data management plan will detail the procedure for 
handling and documenting protocol deviations. 
Clinical study data will be recorded (captured)  electronically by study site personnel  on 
eCRFs. The eCRF will be a validated  clinical data management system according  to 
procedures  that comply with the Code of Federal  Regulations  21 Part 11 and the 
International  Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 
(Topic E6, April 2000) Section 5.5.3. The eCRF data will be entered by study-site 
personnel  and then reviewed and electronically  signed by the investigator  listed on form 
FDA 1572. All study-site personnel must use an electronic  signature access method to 
enter, review, or correct study data. Electronic  signature procedures shall comply with the 
CFR title 21 part II and the ICH guidelines for good clinical practice (GCP) (Topic E6, 
April 2000) section 5.5.3. Passwords  and electronic signatures  will be strictly confidential. 
All eCRF data will be downloaded from the electronic  data capture (EDC) system and 
reformatted  into SAS data sets. The sponsor’s data management  department  will receive 
electronic transfers of laboratory data from a central laboratory as well as other data from 
third-party vendors as appropriate. The electronic  data format of all transfers will be agreed 
upon with the sponsor. 
The clinical monitoring staff will verify data recorded in the EDC system with source 
documents  at the clinical study sites according  to the data management  plan and clinical 
monitoring plan. The data will be subjected to consistency  and validation checks within the 
EDC system with supplemental validation following  download to a SAS data set. 
Adverse events will be coded using a current version of medical dictionary for regulatory  
activities (MedDRA),  and concomitant  medications  using a current version of the WHO drug 
dictionary. The sponsor will perform a medical safety review of the coding. Completed  
eCRF images with a date- and time-stamped electronic audit trail indicating  the user, the data 
entered, and any reason for change (if applicable)  will be archived at the investigator’s  site 
and archived with backup at the sponsor’s site. 
 
12 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) describing each of the planned analyses in detail w ill 
be prepared  and signed before any of the data are unblinded.  
12.1 Analysis Populations:  
Enrolled: The Enrolled Population will consist of all subjects who signed the informed consent 
to participate in the study, and had Screening visit electronic case report form (e CRF) 
collected. 
Randomized: The Randomized Populations will consist of all Enrolled subjects who w ere 
randomized at Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1)  
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 38  
Intent-To-Treat (ITT): The ITT Population will include all randomized subjects who receive at 
least one dose of study medication.  
Per-Protocol (PP): The PP Population will include all ITT subjects who had adequate exposure 
to the randomize d study medication (>85%) during the 24- week period , completed Visit 8 
(Day 112/Week16)  and have adequately complied w ith the protocol as assessed by the 
investigator and sponsor prior to database lock.  The final definition of the PP Population will 
be documented in the prospectively developed SAP prior to undertaking any data analysis.  
 
12.2 Study Subjects  
Demographic and ba seline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment 
group.  Demographic and baseline characteristics include, but are not limited to:  gender, age, 
race, ethnicity, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, and fasting  glucose. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing observation obtained prior to the administration of 
the first dose of randomized study medication at Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1) . 
 
12.3 Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary ef ficacy endpoint is  percentage body weight change from Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 
1) to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24) . 
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, SE, median, min, and max) will be used to summarize 
values of the primary efficacy endpoint, percentage body weight change  from Baseline/Visit 2 
(Day 1) to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24)  and intermediate study visits as 
applicable by treatment group.  These summaries will be presented for the PP Population using 
only observed data and the ITT Populatio n employing the  LOCF approach. 
A mixed-model of analysis of variance (ANCOVA) will be used to analyze change in body 
weight over the study duration in PP and ITT Populations.  The ANCOVA will include treatment group and time as the main effects with baseline weight as the covariate.  The LS 
means, SEs, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the changes from 
baseline to Week 24 will be derived from the model for each treatment.  Each of the fixed -dose 
combinations of leucine, sildenafil, and/or metformin treatment groups (Treatment B, C, D and E) will be compared to placebo group (Treatment A), and the LS means for the treatment 
difference (Treatment B, C D or E minus Treatment A), the SEs, the associated 95% CIs, and 
the p-values will be co mputed. 
 
12.4 Secondary Endpoint Analys is 
All secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed with mixed- effects models similar to the 
primary endpoint analyses.  For endpoints that require logarithm -transformation to ensure data 
normality, the change from  baseline will be calculated as the log -transformed post -baseline 
data minus the log -transformed baseline data.  These changes from baseline data will be 
examined as the dependent variable and the log of the baseline covariate will be included as a 
covariate.  The LS means, SEs, and the corresponding 95% CIs for the changes from 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 39  
Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1)  to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24)  will be derived from 
the ANCOVA model for each treatment.  Each of the fixed -dose combinations of leucine and 
sildenafil and leucine, sildenafil and metformin treatment groups (Treatment B, C, D and E) 
will be compared to placebo group (Treatment A) , and the LS means for the treatment 
difference (Treatment B, C, D and E minus Treatment A), the SEs, and the associat ed 95% CIs 
and p-values will be computed.  The resulting estimates will be exponentially transformed 
back to the original scale to yield geometric LS mean ratios, SEs of the geometric mean ratios  
(calculated as geometric LS mean ratio multiplied by the SE of the LS mean of the log -
transformed data), and the 95% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios.  
 
12.5 Safety Analyses  
All reported terms (investigator descriptions) for AEs will be coded using the most recent 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  TEAEs are defined as adverse events with an onset or worsening after the first randomized dose.  Number and 
percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group, system organ 
classification, and preferred term.  AEs occu rring prior to receiving the first randomized dose 
(e.g., during the Screening and Pre -Treatment Periods) will not be summarized but will be 
provided in listings.   
TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study, TEAEs possibly or probably related to stud y 
treatment, serious TEAEs, death, TEAEs by severity (or intensity), and TEAEs with maximum severity (or intensity) and causality, will be summarized.   
Additionally, TEAEs of special interest, e.g., specific gastrointestinal symptoms, will be summarized separately if deemed necessary.  
All hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis results will be listed by treatment group, subject, and visit, including scheduled and unscheduled/repeat measurements.  Laboratory assessments that are outside of normal ran ges and/or with potential clinical importance will be 
flagged.  Baseline values, the values at each visit, and changes from baseline values will be summarized descriptively for each of the quantitative laboratory assessments by treatment group.  Additionally, shift tables of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis  results will 
be generated to summarize the normal and abnormal (abnormal high and abnormal low) status 
changes from baseline to each post -baseline visit.  
For vital signs, baseline values, t he values at each visit, and changes from baseline values will 
be summarized by treatment group.  
ECG and physical examination data will be provided in listing. 
 13. SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CALCULATION 
A sufficient number of individuals will be screened to enroll at least 250 subjects (50 /per 
treatment).  With an assump tion of 20% dropout rate, approximately 200 subjects (40/per 
treatment) are expected to complete treatment through Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 
168/Week 24) .   
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 40  
Using a two -sided, two -sample comparison (t -test) of means at the alpha=0.05 level of 
significance, sample sizes of 23 subjects per treatment will provide approximately 90% 
power to detect a mean treatment difference of 3 kg body weight (~3.0- 3.3% weight loss 
over 24 weeks), assuming a common standard deviation of 25%.  However, detection of significant changes in obesity co -morbidities require a higher sample size; detection of a 6 
mm Hg change in blood pressure will require a sample size of 40 subjects per treatment group at 80% power; accordingly, the sample size has been increased to 40/treatment arm to 
enable assessment of this secondary endpoint. These assumptions of effect size and standard 
deviation are based on data derived from the previous clinical trial of NS -0200 (NS -0200-01) 
and represents the anticipated treatment effect of effective fixed -dose combinations of 
leucine and sildenafil, with or without metformin, compared to placebo

the date the marketing application  (NDA) is approved for the indication  for which the drug 
was investigated,  or (b) for a minimum of two years  following  the release date of the final 
report, if no marketing  application  is to be filed by the sponsor, or if the marketing  
application is not approved for the indication  of which the drug was investigated  or is 
discontinued and the FDA has been notified, or (c) for a minimum of 15 years after the 
completion  or discontinuation  of the study to be filed in support of registration  in the 
European  Union. If the investigator relocates,  retires for any reason or withdraws  from the 
study, the study records may be transferred  to an acceptable designee, such as another 
investigator, another institution,  or to the sponsor. The investigator  must obtain written 
permission  from the sponsor before disposing any study records. 
 
14.7 Deviation  from the Protocol  
The investigator  is not to deviate from the protocol. In  medical emergencies,  the investigator 
will use medical judgment and will remove the subject from immediate  hazard. The 
investigator will immediately  notify the sponsor and IRB regarding the nature of the  
emergency  and the course of action taken. The investigator  is to notify the sponsor of any 
inadvertent  protocol deviations upon discovery,  and is to document  the deviations  
appropriately in the study files or on the eCRFs. The sponsor assumes no responsibility or 
liability for any unapproved deviations.

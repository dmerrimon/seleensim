Study C16007 Statistical Analysis Plan
61.  INTRODUCTION
In general, the purpose of the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) is to provide a framework that 
addresses the protocol objectives in a statistically
 rigorous fashion, with minimized bias or 
analytical deficiencies.  Specificall y, this plan has the following purpose:
To prospectivel y (a priori) outline the ty pes of analy ses and data presentations that will 
address the stud y objectives outlined in the protocol, and to explain in detail how the data 
will be handled and analy zed, adhering to commonly  accepted standards and practices of 
biostatistic al analy sis in the pharmaceutical industry .
1.1  Study Design
This is an open -label, multicenter, phase 1, dose -escalation study  of MLN9708 in adult 
patient swith previously  treated s ystemic light-chain ( AL)amyloidosis
.  A 3 + 3 dose -
escalation scheme will be implemented.  Patients will receive escalating doses of MLN9708 
orally  (PO)on Day s 1, 8, and 15 in a 28 -day cycle in the absence of disease progression
(PD) or unacceptable toxicity .  If there is no hematologic response ( complete response 
[CR],very good partial response [ VGPR ], or partial response [ PR]) after completion of 3 
cycles of single -agent MLN9708, dexamethasone will be added on Day s 1 to 4 of every  
cycle (Day s1-4 every  28days) beginning with Cycle 4.  The patient’s response status will be 
reassessed after 3 additional cy cles; if there is no hematologic response at that time, the 
patient will be removed from treatment and followed for survival.
Once the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D )has been 
established, 2 expans ion cohorts of patients with relapsed or refractory  amy loidosis, 
including approximately  10 proteasome inhibitor -naïve patients and approximately  16 
proteasome inhibitor- exposed patients, will be treated at the MTD/RP2D to more fully  
characterize the safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of ML N9708, quality  of life (QOL) , and the 
pharmacokinetics ( PK)and pharmacod ynamics of ML N9708 in this patient population.

82.  POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSIS
2.1  Safety Population and Enrolled Patients
The Safet
y population is defined as patient swho receive at least 1 dose of ML N9708.  The 
Safety  population will be used for all safet y anal yses.In this study , the enrolled patients are 
the patients who received
at least 1 dose of MLN9708. 
2.2  DLT - Evaluable Population
The Dose -Limiting Toxicity  (DLT) Evaluable population is defined as patients who receive 
all Cy cle-
1 doses of MLN9708 or experience a DLT in C ycle 1 of the dose -escalation phase .  
The DLT
-evaluable population will be used to determine the MTD.
2.3  Organ Response - Evaluable Population
The Organ Response -Evaluable population is defined as patients who receive at least 1 cy cle 
of MLN9708, have am yloid involvement of at least kidney  or heart at baseline, and have at 
least 1 postbaseline organ response assessment.
2.4  Hematological Response Evaluable Population
The Hematologic Response -Evaluable population is defi ned as patients who receive at least 
1 cycle of MLN9708, have measurable disease at baseline, and have at least 1 post-baseline 
hematologic response assessment.
2.5  P harmacokinetic Analysis Population
The PK Anal ysis population is defined as p atient swho receive at least 
1dose of MLN9708
and h ave sufficient MLN2238 concentration -time data and dosing data to permit the 
calculation of PK parameters .
2.6  P harmacodynamic Analysis Population
The Pharmacod ynamic Analy sis population is defined as p atients who receive at least 1dose 
of MLN9708 and h ave sufficient whole blood 20S proteasome inhibition-time data to permit

93.  HYPOTHESES AND DECIS ION RULES
Not applicable for a phase 1 study
4.  INTERIM ANALYSIS
As this is a phase 1study ,there is not a formal interim anal ysis.  There will be an ongoing 
review of safet y data with the medical monitor and study  investigators.
5.  STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
Analy ses will be primarily  descriptive in nature. No formal statistical tests will be 
performed. Summary  tabulations will be presented that display  the number of observations,
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and 
the number and percent
age(calculated using nonmissing values) per category  for categorical 
data, unless specified otherwise.
Patients will be analy zed at the dose level to which they  were originally  assigned, including 
those who receive subsequent treatment at a lower dose level .
The anal yses for the clinical study  report (CSR) will be conducted after 75% of patients 
have PD or 12 months after last patient is enrolled, wh ichever occurs first in the study . At 
that time, all relevant data will be queried and cleaned; a database snapshot will be taken and 
used for the CSR. Additional follow -up treatment data will be entered into the database 
through stud y termination. Anal yses may  be updated based on additional information. An 
addendum to the CSR may  be written if warranted based on these anal yses.  
If deemed 
appropriate, however, the sponsor may  decide to perform the anal yses for CSR at the end of 
the study  (EOS) ,which i s approximately  2 years after the last patient is enrolled.
5.1  Sample Size Justification
A 3+3 dose -escalation scheme will be conducted, with 3 to 6 DL T
-evaluable patients 
evaluated at each dose level.  I t is expected that as many  as 30 patients will be enrolled in 
the dose -escalation part of this study .

Study C16007 Statistical Analysis Plan
10Once the MTD/R2PD has been established, the following 2 expansion cohorts will be 
treated at the MTD or RP2D :
1.Proteasome inhibitor -naive expansion cohort including approximately  8 organ 
response -evaluabl e patients.  There will be approximately  83% probability of 
observing at least 2 patients with organ responses among 8 patients based on the 
binomial probability  calculation if the overall organ response rate is 35% for this 
population.  Approximately  10 p atients will be enrolled to obtain 8 response -
evaluable patients.
2.Proteasome inhibitor -exposed expansion cohort including approximately  14 organ 
response -evaluable patients.  There will be approximately  80% probability of 
observing at least 2 patients with organ responses among 14 patients based on the 
binomial probability  calculation if the overall organ response rate is 20% for this 
population.  Approximately  16 patients will be enrolled to obtain 14 organ response -
evaluable patients.
Proteasome inhibitor -naïve patients are the patients who have not received any  prior 
bortezomib contained therap yand the roteasome inhibitor -exposed patients are the patients 
who received at least one prior bortezomib contained therap y. Because approximately  6 
patients in th e dose -escalation part of the study  will be included in the expansion cohorts, 
approximately  20 patients will be enrolled in the expansion part of this study . Please note 
that this is only  for sample size justification, and the sponsor can stop the study  enrollment 
for expansion cohorts at any  time if deemed appropriate.
Overall, as man y as 50 patients will be enrolled in this study .
5.2  Randomization and Stratification
No randomization or stratification will be performed in this study . Patients will be e nrolled 
in successive dose cohorts during dose escalation.  For the MTD disease expansion cohorts, 
patients will be enrolled in 1 of 
2 expansion cohorts based on whether they  have received a 
proteasome inhibitor- contain ingtherapy .
5.3  Unblinding
As this i s an open- label study ;no unblinding methodology  is required.

115.4  Data Handling
5.4.1  Methods for Handling Missing Data
Decisions regarding eligibility  for this study  may  be made using local laboratory  
determinations in the dose
-escalation segment of this st udy.  For dosing decisions, local 
hematology and chemistry  laboratory  results may  be used.
All available efficacy  and safet y data will be included in data listings. For summary  tables, 
laboratory  test results from the central laboratory  will be used when they are available. 
Laboratory  test results from local laborator ieswill be used only when no central laboratory  
test results exist at the same scheduled sample collection time point andwhen the local 
laboratory  results support an adverse event (AE) , dos e modification ,or other medical 
decision.
5.4.2  Definition of Baseline Values
Unless otherwise specified, the baseline value is defined as the value collected at the time 
closest to, but before , the start of study  drug administration .
5.4.3  Windowing of Visit s
All data will be categorized based on the scheduled visit at which they  were collected.  
T
hese visit designators are predefined values that appear as part of the visit tab in the 
electronic case report form ( eCRF ).
Refer to protocol Section 7.4.14 for de tails about the PKand pharmacod ynamic sample 
collection window s.
5.4.4  Justification of Pooling
All data from all sites will be pooled.  Study  center or treatment
-by-center interaction will 
not be included in an y statistical anal ysis.
Due to the use of modi fied accelerated titration design for dose escalation, at a minimum, 1
patient will be dosed at any  given dose level.  Data may  be pooled across dose levels for 
summary  purposes.  When appropriate, data will be summarized for patient sat each dose 
level and pooled dose levels during dose escalation, patients at each expansion cohort
(including the patients at MTD during dose escalation), all patient s enrolled at the MTD
dose level , and all patient soverall .

Hematologic disease PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of MLN9708 
to the date of documented hematologic PD oranydeath .Organ disease PFS is defined as 
the time from the date of the first dose of MLN9708 to the date of documented organ PD or 
any death.   Patients will be censored in an y of the following scenarios:
If the patient starts an alternative antineoplastic therap y before the documentation of 
PD, th en he or she will be censored at the date of the last available response 
assessment prior to the alternative antineoplastic therap y.
If the patient has no documented PD and has not started alternative antineoplastic 
therap y and is still alive at the time o f anal ysis, he or she will be censored at the date 
ofthelast available response assessment.
OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of MLN9708 to the date of death. 
Patients without documentation of death at the time of anal ysis will b
e censored at the date 
last known to be alive. One-year OSrate is defined as the patient survival rate at 1 year 
after the date of thefirst dose of MLN9708.
5.8.2  Efficacy Analyses
The hematologic response (CR, VGPR, PR, no change [ NC], PD) 
rate will be t abulated and 
analyzed based on the H ematologic Response -Evaluable population and presented with a 2-
sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval.  In addition, the overall hematologic response 
ratesup to the end of Cycle 3 and up to the end of Cycle 6 wil l also be tabulated and 
analyzed in asimilar way.
Vital organ response rate will be tabulated and analy zed based on the 
Organ Response -
Evaluable population. Organ- specific response rate will be tabulated and analy zed based on 
in the subgroup of theOrgan Response -Evaluable population with amyloid involvement of 
the specific organ at baseline. Estimates of the organ response rate will be presented with 2-
sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals.

appropriate.
Raw values of serum M
-protein, urine M -protein, serum free light chain (FLC) ,and the 
difference between amyloid-forming and nonam yloid -formi ng free light chain (dFLC), as 
well as the change from baseline ,will be presented in by -patient listings. A waterfall plot 
will be generated to display  the maximum change from baseline indFLC.
QOL will be assessed for patients in the expansion cohorts o nly using the European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Qualit y of Life Questionnaire -Core 30 
(EORTC -QLQ -C30,multiple my eloma module).  Descriptive statistics will be presented for 
both the actual values and the change sfrom baseline in EORTC- QLQ -C30 assessment over 
time.  EORTC -QLQ-C30 assessments will be analy zed to determine if hematologic response 
to therap y is accompanied by measurable improvement in QOL .
5.9   P harmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic , and Exploratory Analysis
5.9.1
  Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The PK A nalysis population will be used for the description of the PK profile and for the 
estimation of PK parameters .
PK evaluation will be based on concentrations of ML N2238, the complete hy drolysis 
product of MLN9708, in specimens collected at prespecified times before and after drug 
administration.  Actual sample collection times will be used for the calculation of PK 
parameters. In the event that actual collection times are either unreliable or missing, 
scheduled collection times will be u sed. For ease of presentation, scheduled collection times 
will be used to present results in tables and figures. Both scheduled and actual collection
times will be presented in listings.

MLN9708
Study C16007 Statistical Analysis Plan
18Concentrations of MLN2238 that are below the limit of quantificatio n (BLQ) will be treated 
as zero. Concentration data that are considered anomalous may  be excluded from the 
concentration summaries and plots and will not be used in the calculation of PK parameters. 
Evidence or explanation will be provided to justify  theexclusion of data.
When summarizing concentrations or PK parameters, a minimum of 2 values is required to 
show the mean and geometric mean, and at least 3 values are required to show the standard 
deviation and coefficient of variation ( CV).Summary  stati stics will be reported only  if the 
calculated mean value is greater than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and at least 
50% of the values are nonzero.
5.9.1.1   Plasma and Whole Blood Pharmacokinetic Profiles
Individual patient plasma and whole blood conc entration data will be listed. Concentrations 
will be summarized (N, mean, standard deviation, CV, geometric mean ,median, min, and 
max) according to dose cohort and dosing cy cle and day . Population mean and individual 
plasma and whole blood concentration- time data will be plotted by  dose cohort and dosing 
cycle and day .
5.9.1.2
  Plasma and Whole Blood Pharmacokinetic Parameters
The following PK parameters will be calculated by noncompartmental methods , as data 
permit, from concentration- time data:
Param eter Definition Units
Cmax Observed maximum concentration ng/mL
Tmax First time Cmax is observed hr
Ctrough Observed concentration at the end of a dosing interval ng/mL
AUC tau Area under the concentration -time curve, time 0 to end of dosing interval , 
estimat ed using the linear -log trapezoidal methodhr*ng/mL
lambda z Term inal disposition phase rate constant 1/hr
t1/2 Term inal disposition phase half -life hr
Rac Accumulation ratio unitless
Different PK parameters are to be estimated following dosing on Day 1and Day  15. For 
some of the doses, concentration data is coll ected only on either Day 1or on Day 15. PK 
parameters will be calculated accordingl y.The PK parameters to be estimated for each day  
of dosing are as follows:

according to dose cohort and dosing cy cle and day .
5.9.2   Pharmacodynamic Analyses
The Pharmacod ynamic A nalysis population will be used for the description of the 
pharmacod ynamic profile and for the estimation of pharmacod ynamic parameter s.
The pharmacod ynamic measure that will be anal yzed is whole blood 20S proteasome 
inhibition . The inhibition is defined as the postdose proteasome activity times divided by 
the baseline proteasome activity .  If the baseline proteasome activity  is missing or is BLQ 
for a patient, then no inhibition will be calculated for thatpatient. Individual and mean 
whole blood 20S proteasome inhibition data will be plotted over time ,and summary  
tabulations will be presented.
Actual specimen collection times will be used for the calculation of pharmacody namic 
parameters. In the event that actual collection times are either unreliable or missing, 
scheduled collection times will be used. For ease of presentation, scheduled collection times 
will be used to present results in tables and figures. Both scheduled and actual collection 
times will be presented in listings.
Proteasome activit y measurements that are BLQ will be treated as zero. Proteasome activit y 
measurements that are considered anomalous may be excluded fr om data summaries and 
plots and will not be used in the calculation of pharmacod ynamic parameters. Evidence or 
explanations will be provided to justify  the exclusion of data.

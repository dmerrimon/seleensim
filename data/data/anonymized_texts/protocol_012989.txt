PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Title  HIIN – COPD:   A Cluster Randomized, Stepped -Wedge Evaluation of Post 
Discharge Utilization among Patients wit h an Acute Exacerbation of COPD  
Study Design  A cluster randomized, stepped -wedge quality improvement evaluation  
Study 
Objectives  The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of using a COPD clinical 
pathway compared to usual care among patients with an acute COPD 
exacerbation, on 60 -day post discharge utilization (ED, inpatient, and observation 
encounters)  
 
The secondary objectives are to examine the COPD clinical pathway’s effect on 
additional patient outcomes, such as the  
a. CHS Quality, Comfort, and Care 30 -day readmission rate. This is a 
readmission rate among patients with an inpatient readmission to the same 
CHS facility as the index encounter.  
b. The patient -centric 30 -day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate 
among patients with an inpatient or observation readmission to any CHS 
facility.  
c. The patient -centric 30 -day readmission rate where the primary diagnosis of 
the readmission is COPD.  
d. Length of stay  
e. Rate of follow -up visit within 5 days of discharge.  
f. Antibiotic order rate during admission  
g. Steroid order rate during admission  
h. Short acting bronchodilator order rate during admission  
Additional analyses will be to explore:  
 
a. The methodology for identification of COPD exacerbation within the first 
24 hours of hospital admission will be compared to retrospective 
identification through billing cod es. 
b. As a sub -analysis, qualitative outcomes will be collected and measured 
with patients, providers, and leaders. These outcomes will be collected and 
evaluated, per a sub -study protocol addendum.  
Study 
Population  Patients 40 years of age or older hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of COPD 
are included. A n acute exacerbation is defined as an encounter where the 
following criteria are met within 24 hours of admission.  
 
• The use of the COPD PowerPlan  or 
• A respiratory therapy navigator notification of COPD exacerbation or 
• The use of the respiratory therapy department COPD bronchodilator 
protocol or 
Version Number: 1.0  
Version Date: 5 -15-17 
  
5 • A historical diagnosis of COPD or 
A history of COPD in the admitting documentation or 
A COPD diagnosis on the problem list AND  
An order of systemic steroids (prednisone or methylprednisolone)  
 
For the purposes of this project, the evaluable population will include patients who 
meet the same age criteria and have a discharge diagnosis of acu te exacerbation of 
COPD  
Study 
Procedures  During this project, patients who are hospitalized at select CHS sites with COPD 
acute exacerbation symptoms will be treated per the CHS COPD clinical pathway 
(COPD Pathway). The COPD clinical pathway will include four components: (i) 
discrete, evidence -based care steps (ii) patient navigation, (iii) daily data driven 
care gap identification, (iv) monthly leadership huddles.  
 
The evidence based care steps include: (1) verification of COPD diagnosis and 
severity, (2) patient/caregiver education regarding CO PD and basic self -
management skills, (3) standard pharmacologic bundle of systemic steroids, 
empiric antibiotics, bronchodilators, (4) pneumococcal and influenza vaccination 
review and completion, (5) smoking cessation advice and therapy when 
appropriate, (6) comprehensive care management assessment, (7) 
recommendations for pulmonary consultation, (8) recommendations for palliative 
care consultation, (9) use of discharge checklist, (10) recommendations for content 
of outpatient follow -up, and will be driven  primarily by provider utilization of a 
comprehensive order -set that includes each component and a discharge check list.   
 
Patient navigation will be provided by the  COPD Pathway Coordinator  (COPD 
Coordinator) at each site. This role will be filled by an individual (s) who already 
exists on a site’s care team. Because of this, the COPD Coordinator’s site role and 
background may vary by site. The COPD Coordinators will be responsible for 
daily  monitoring of care gaps that exist for COPD patients and their respective 
sites and alerting appropriate team member to help close those gaps. The COPD 
Coordinators will receive a daily COPD Gaps list. The COPD Gaps list identifies 
patients who are hospit alized at that time and the associated gaps in receiving the 
evidence based care components.  
 
The intervention occurs at the site level and sites are randomized to the order they 
will receive the intervention in clusters of two.  Two additional facilities  will be 
added on a rolling basis in 2 month intervals, until all 8 facilities are active in 
using the COPD pathway. Once added, sites will begin utilizing the COPD 
Pathway in their daily practice.  
 
As a part of the COPD clinical pathway, patients will me et the following discharge 
checklist criteria:  
 
• On a long acting bronchodilator for 24 hours  
• A short acting bronchodilator is scheduled no more frequently than 4 times 
daily for 24 hours  
Version Number: 1.0  
Version Date: 5 -15-17 
  
6  
 
 
  • Be off IV steroids for 24 hours prior to discharge  
• A steroid prescri ption, or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• An antibiotic prescribed or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• A scheduled appointment with a care provider within 5 days of discharge  
• Received COPD education during discharge  
Statistical 
Analysis  Analyses is among patients identified as having an acute exacerbation of COPD 
based on final billed coding.  Comparisons of patients hospitalized during the 
intervention and usual care periods will be made using generalized estimating 
equations to  control for clustering within hospital and repeated measures within 
hospital.  The primary outcome, 60 -day utilization, will be compared between the 
two groups of patients using a logit link in the generalized estimating equations. 
Results will be present ed with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.  
Sample Size 
Analysis  8 hospitals will be randomized to intervention in 2 facilities per 2 month 
increments. With the assumption of detecting a change in rates of 60 -day non -
elective acute care utilization from 43% in the control period to 33% in the 
intervention period, 59 patients with COPD exacerbation per hospital per two 
months is needed to achieve a power of 0.80 (intra -class correlation coefficients 
(ICC)=0.05 and two -side α=0.05. To account for this varying cluster size, we 
inflated the number of patients by 25% resulting in an average of 74 patients per 
hospital per two months, resulting in a total sample size of 2960 patients among 
the intervention group.

9 1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1. Hypothesis  
 
Patients with an acute COPD exacerbation, who receive care at a site using the COPD clinical pathway, 
will have lower 60 -day post discharge utilization than patients that receive usual care.  
1.2. Primary  Objective  
 
The primary objective is to evaluate the effe ctiveness of the use of the COPD clinical pathway 
compared to usual care, on 60 -day post discharge utilization (ED, inpatient, observation encounters) 
among patients with an acute COPD exacerbation.  
 
1.3. Secondary Objectives  
 
a. The secondary objectives are to examine the COPD clinical pathway’s effect on additional patient 
outcomes, such as the  
i. CHS Quality, Comfort, and Care 30 -day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate 
among patients with an inpatient readmission to the same CHS facility as the index 
encounter.  
ii. The patient -centric 30 -day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate among patients 
with an inpatient or observation readmission to any CHS facility.  
b. The methodology for identification of COPD exacerbation withi n the first 24 hours of hospital 
admission will be compared to retrospective identification through billing codes.  
c. Demographics and comorbid conditions will be characterized among the historical population of 
patients at CHS with COPD exacerbation.  
2. BACKGRO UND  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by persistent respiratory 
symptoms, incompletely reversible expiratory airflow obstruction, intermittent episodes of acute airway 
and alveolar inflammation termed exacerbat ions. CO PD is hallmark ed with  periods of symptom stability, 
and periodic acute deteriorations of the patient’s disease condition, called exacerbations. Acute COPD 
exacerbations frequently lead to ED utilization and/or hospitalization in acute care facilities1. Reported 
COPD costs in the U.S. have reached approximately $ 37 billion annually, with hospitalizations accounting 
for most  the estimated costs, and are only expected to contin ue rising.  Prior to implementation of the CMS 
Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, approximately 20% of patients admitted to a hospital for 
AECOPD were readmitted (all cause) within 30 days. Other types of acute care utilization following 
hospital admi ssion (ED visits, Urgent Care encounters, hospital observation stays have not been studied2.   
Less stringent definitions of care utilization including readmission and ED and/or Urgent Care encounters 
further than 30 days out, can safely be assumed to be even worse.  
 
With the advent  of value based care , and the rise of bundled payments for a single episode or cycle of care, 
it has become increasingly important to devise innovative care delivery systems and pathways that will 
both treat patients effectively in the acute setting and pr event readmissions. Further haste driving

10 innovation and work in this disease state, has been Medicare’s identification of COPD as a target for the 
Hospital Readmission Reduction Program . This program  penalizes hospitals for 30 -day readmissions  
among patie nts for specific index encounters, such as those with COPD3.  
 
Development and implementation of new acute COPD care models will cost significant investment of time 
and capital. Such investment and the need to have a valid assessment of benefit, necessitate strategic, a 
priori evaluation planning and execution prior to widespread implementation.  
 
Healthcare systems  are increasingly adopting disease specific Clinical Pathways (CPW’s) . These pathways  
are structured , multidisciplinary care plans, often inclusiv e of order sets, that detail necessary care steps for 
patients with a specific disease. Despite being present since the 1980’s and fairly ubiquitous in many 
hospitals since the early 2000’s, they have a limited evidence base. A 2011 Cochrane review could n ot 
draw conclusions on their effects on length of stay and cost , due to variability in study design s. However, 
review of the resulting data did show reduced hospital complications (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.36 -0.94).  
Another review show ed that a 3 -month integrated disease management intervention (multidisciplinary, 
multi -faceted care)  among inpatients  was beneficial  with 15 patients need ing to be treated to eliminate 1 
respiratory related hospital admission4-7. Particul arly in the transition to value based care models, there 
remains a n obligation  for further research to prove effectiveness and cost efficacy for care pathways . 
 
There have been ongoing efforts to define the COPD population based on biologic factors, clinic al 
characteristics, and social determinants of health to help identify patients at risk for exacerbations, hospital 
admission, hospital readmission, and mortality.  Some factors associated with increased risk of hospital 
readmission include congestive hear t failure, behavioral health issues, medical frailty, increasing age, and 
(simply) prior admission for a COPD exacerbation3,8.  Predictive models and scoring systems have been 
devised, most commonly using dyspnea scores, measurements of expiratory airflow limitation, previous 
hospitalizations, age, and chronic comorbidities; however, use of these tools has not been proven to reduce 
acute healthcare utilization.  Attempts at care pathways for delivery of standardized intervention for acute 
COPD exacer bations and complex care interventions for patients with COPD have produced equivocal 
results and there is lack of consensus as to whether such clinical care pathways convincingly improve 
overall patient outc omes.  
 
Even as improvements are made in terms of  the understanding of the COPD population , and risk factors for 
readmission, the optimal method to reduce utilization  remains questionable. Attempts at care pathways  
nationwide , and other interventions for COPD patients have been undertaken with mixed repo rts of 
success. The state of research is best summarized by noting that , while several intermediate or process -
oriented outcomes (such as patient self -report of ability to manage symptoms or number of follow -up 
phone calls made to patients) have been impacted by efforts to improve coordination of care, studies to date 
have yet  to convincingly illustrate an improvement in utilization rates after any such intervention9-11. 
 
3. RATIONALE  
To better enhance the care of patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD, Carolinas HealthCare System 
(CHS) has designed a COPD clinical pathway, a structured multidisciplinary care plan. The care plan 
utilizes a  data system that identifies patients with exacerbation and care gaps in real -time. It includes an 
EMR based order set, patient education, and discharge criteria. A COPD pathway coordinator wh o works 
to close care gaps and ensure a standardized approach is also part of the care plan.

Version Date: 5 -15-17 
  
11 At participating CHS hospital, patients who are admitted with a suspected acute COPD exac erbation, will 
enter the COPD  clinical p athway. The COPD clinical pathway  includes the following key components 
during hospitalization: and an order within 24 hours of being admitted of a short acting bronchodilator, an 
antibiotic, and a steroid, as well as a standardized discharge plan. A patient’s journey through the clinical  
pathway, ends at discharge. The discharge checklist requires that patients:  
 
• Be on a long acting bronchodilator for 24 hours  
• Bo on a short acting bronchodilator is scheduled no more frequently than 4 times daily for 24 hours  
• Be off IV steroids for 24 hou rs prior to discharge  
• Have a steroid prescription, or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• Have an antibiotic prescribed or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• Have a scheduled appointment with a care provider within 5 days of discharge  
• Receive COPD education during discharge  
This proposed evaluation is designed to guide CHS strategy and quality improvement for COPD by 
applying research methodology and data analytics to create valid outcomes. Ultimately, as CHS deploys 
resource intensive i nterventions like this, it is important for the system and its patients to know answers to 
questions such as: Does this process impact readmissions and utilization?  
 
This research project is a pragmatic, randomized quality improvement evaluation which seek s to evaluate 
the effects of standardizing the use of a COPD clinical pathway across various participating facilities 
among patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD.  The outcomes evaluation of this quality 
improvement intervention has been designed to integrate into the routine care and minimize frontline staff 
burden by deploying an evaluation that occurs in a real -world setting with no additional data collection 
outside of usual care.   
 
4. SUBJECT AND SITE SEL ECTION  
4.1 Accrual  
 
A daily patient list will be generated through an automated process utilizing clinical and patient registration 
information. The list will indicate patients newly hospitalized (hospitalization within the preceding 24 -hour 
period) with symptoms of suspected acute COPD exacerbat ion, at any of the eight facilities. The list 
contains inpatient and observation encounters. The patient list will identify patients at any of the eight 
facilities throughout the project, not just once the facility has implemented the standardized use of t he 
COPD clinical pathway. For the purposes of this project, we are not enrolling towards a targeted patient 
accrual. We will enroll patients during a pre -determined data collection period, See Section 6.  
 
4.2 Subjects  
 
An acute exacerbation is defined as a n encounter where one the following criteria are met within 24 hours of 
admission.  
 
• The use of the COPD PowerPlan or 
• A respiratory therapy navigator notification of COPD exacerbation or 
Version Number: 1.0  
Version Date: 5 -15-17 
  
12 • The use of the respiratory therapy department COPD bronchodilator protocol or 
• A historical diagnosis of COPD or 
A history of COPD in the admitting documentation or 
A COPD diagnosis on the problem list AND  
An order of systemic steroids (prednisone or methylprednisolone)  
 
To identify appropriate records of available clinical data for baseline and historical data collection and 
analysis, we will provision using the following ICD 10 code  for COPD:  J44.1  
 
4.3 Participating Sites  
 
As part of the research design and rollout of this project, randomization will occur at the site level. CORE 
has randomized the facility participation order in advance of project kickoff. Site enrollment will begin with 
two facilities,  adding on 2 additional facilities on a rolling basis in 2 month intervals, until all 8 facilities are 
active in using the COPD pathway. Once added, sites will begin utilizing the COPD clinical pathway in 
their daily practice with the target patient popula tion.  
 
The following Carolinas Healthcare System sites will be randomized for participation in this project.  
 
• Carolinas HealthCare System Cleveland  
• Carolinas HealthCare System Kings Mountain  
• Carolinas HealthCare System Lincoln  
• Carolinas HealthCare System NorthEast  
• Carolinas HealthCare System Pineville  
• Carolinas HealthCare System Union  
• Carolinas HealthCare System University  
• Carolinas Medical Center  
 
4.4 Inclusion \Exclusion Criteria  
4.4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Because this is a site -wide intervention, all patients who have a COPD exacerbation, as determined 
by their clinical care provider will be subject to receiving components of the intervention. Patients 
will be included in the daily Gap List based on the fol lowing criteria:  
 
• ≥ 40 years of age at time of admission  
• Identified as having an acute exacerbation of COPD  within 24 hours  of admission  
 
4.4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects mu st not meet any of the following criteria:  
 
• Death  during the index encounter  
• Not discharged by the end of the study

13 4.5 E valuable P opulation  
 
Patients included in the evaluable population for this project, will have their data inform the final outcomes 
assessment.  For the purposes of this project, t he evaluable population will inc lude patients  who meet the 
same age criteria and have a discharge diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD : J44.1  
 
5. OVERALL DESI GN 
5.1 Outcome Variables  
5.1.1 Primary Outcome Variable  
The primary outcome variable is 60-day post discharge utilization (ED, inpatient, and observation 
encounters).  
5.1.2 Secondary Outcome Variable(s)  
Secondary outcome variables of the evaluation include:  
 
Examining the COPD clinical pathway’s effect on additional patient outcomes, such as the  
i. CHS Quality, Comfort, and Care 30 -day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate among 
patients with an inpatient readmission to the same CHS facility as the index encounter.  
j. The patient -centric 30 -day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate among patie nts with an 
inpatient or observation readmission to any CHS facility.  
k. The patient -centric 30 -day readmission rate where the primary diagnosis of the readmission is 
COPD.  
l. Length of stay  
m. Rate of follow -up visit within 5 days of discharge.  
n. Antibiotic order r ate during admission  
o. Steroid  order rate during admission  
p. Short acting bronchodilator order rate  during admission  
5.1.3 Additional assessments  
The methodology for identification of COPD exacerbation within the first 24 hours of hospital 
admission  will be co mpared  to retrospective identification through billing codes.  
 
As a sub -analysis, qualitative outcomes will be collected and measured with patients, providers, 
and leaders. These outcomes will be collected and evaluated, per a sub -study protocol addendum.  
 
5.2 Trial Design  
5.2.1  Justification for stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial  
The primary aim is to assess the effectiveness of a structured multidisciplinary care plans 
(intervention ), compared with standard care (control) on 60 -day non -elective acute care utilization 
(ED visits, obs ervation , and inpatient encounters). The COPD clinical pathway  will be delivered at 
the level of hospital or cluster , thus minimizing contamination and the risk of selection bias , if 
subjects were randomized at the individual level12. Therefore, the unit of randomization and 
Version Number: 1.0  
Version Date: 5 -15-17 
  
14 analysis for this study will be the cluster. Considering logistical constraints  and design rigor , the 
intervention will be rolled out sequentially instead of at the same time.  Moreover, substantial and 
differential cluster -effects may exist because of distinct volume and characteristics of patients in 
each hospital. Thus, the stepped wedge design is advantageous  compared with other alternative 
designs.  
5.2.2 Randomization and allocation  
The stepped w edge design implies a baseline period , in which no clusters are exposed to the 
intervention12. Then, at the chosen tim e interval of two months, two hospitals will be randomized 
to cross from the control to intervention ( Figure 1 ). This process continues until all eight hospitals 
have crossed over to the intervention. The order of this cross over process will be randomized . We 
will use block randomization to assign two hospitals at a time to switch from the control to 
intervention using SAS Enterprise Guide version 6.1. Allocation will be communicated only to 
hospital  senior leadership initially to prevent contamination. Others including providers at the 
hospital will learn of allocation in the month preceding roll -out. Patients in included hospitals will 
be blind ed to the intervention or control period.

5.2.3 Sample size analysis  
Calculations of sample size were based on the primary endpoints of 60 -day non -elective acute care 
utilization. With the assumption of detecting a change in rates of 60 -day non -elective acute care 
utilization from 43% in the control period to 33% in the intervention period , 59 patients with 
COPD exacerbation per hospital per two months is needed to achieve a power of 0.80 (intra-class 
correlation coefficients (ICC) =0.05  and two -side α=0.05. Holding other parameters constant, the 
larger ICC is, the higher the power we will  obtain ( Figure 2 ). With sample size s per cluster per 
two months ranging from 30 to 158, our preliminary data shows that the coefficient of variation 
(CV) of sample size is approximately  0.5. To account for this varying cluster size, we inflated the 
number o f patients by 25% resulting in an average of 74 patients per hospital per two months13, 
resulting in a total sample size of 2960  patients among the intervention group and 5920 patients 
overa ll inclusive of our control population.  The power was calculated by using the PASS 1514.

5.2.4 Statistical analysis  
All data quality monitorin g and analysis will be overseen by Dr. Jing Zhao . Distributions of baseline  
characteristics for hospitals and patients will be compared between the intervention or control periods to 
assess effectiveness of the randomization, and statistical or clinical differences will be adjusted in 
sensitivity analyses. All analyses for treatm ent and control periods comparisons will use an intention -to-
treat approach and results will be reported used the CONSORT extension to cluster randomized trials.  
 
5.2.5 Primary aim  
The primary outcome for this study is 60 -day non -elective acute care utilization. Characteristics of the 
hospitals and individuals will be summarized by  levels  of randomization  steps , hospitals and individuals. 
The count, rates and 95% confidence intervals of 60 -day non -elective acute care utilization in the -control 
period  will be presented and compared with that in the -treatment period. The primary analysis will be 
conduct ed using  generalized estimating equations with fixed effects for intervention,  time (steps), and 
intervention multiply by the time, accounting for the c luster randomized trial design with a random cluster 
(hospitals) effect. We will estimate and report the intra class correlation coefficients for all outcome 
measures to assess assumptions for sample size analyses and for future investigations using simila r designs 
and outcomes. The primary  analyses will follow the intention to treat principle with an additional per 
protocol analysis  including by using denominator in those who had pathway ordered as well as 
intervention periods when truly occurred . The seco ndary analyses will include within cluster comparisons 
of intervention and control periods (not adjusting for any confounding effect of time) , as well as 
comparisons of a series of (unbalanced) quasi -parallel cluster trials  between those enrolled and unenr olled 
clusters at each intervention enrollment period . The same analyses plan will also be applied to secondary 
outcomes . 59 57 54 51 48 45938985807570167160151142134125

16 5.2.6 Missing data  
All the related available electronic data will be pulled without missing any subjects.  Thus, the missing of 
outcome variables are less likely to occur. However, the missing information on covariables is unavoidable. 
Sensitivity analyses are recommended for trials with missing data. We will compare baseline characteristics 
such as age, gende r, and health insurance status between patients with complete follow -up data to those 
with missing data by intervention period to assess potential biases that may exist in the complete case 
analysis. We will conduct sensitivity analyses for the primary and  secondary outcomes using several 
methods which have different missing data assumptions: (1) complete case analyses which assumes missing 
completely at random; (2) multiple imputation using M=10 imputations, which assumes missing at random; 
and (3) assigni ng poor scores and good scores for missing values differentially by treatment group, which 
aligns with non -ignorable missingness (the data missingness is related to the actual value).  
 
 
5.3 Training  
 
Beginning two to three weeks prior to first patient enrolment at the respective facility, the COPD pathway 
coordinator  and those responsible for discharge  will begin training on the materials supporting the pathway 
as well as use of the pathway itself. This will include communication touchpoints between the  coordinator, 
discharge facilitator as well as the individuals responsible for the clinical path. Specifically, there will be 
education on the COPD protocol, Education Checklist, the COPD clinical pathway  and order set as well as 
the criteria and fulfillme nt options required for discharge.  
 
5.4 Data Collection Dates 
 
The impl ementation of the COPD clinical pathway will begin on 6 /1/17 at the first two facilities . 
 
5.5 Continuation of the I ntervention  
 
Participating sites will likely continue treating patients diagnosed with an acute COPD exacerbation per the 
COPD clinical pathway after the study period has ended.  This is outside the purview  of the evaluation 
protocol and will be decided by clinical and administrative leaders at the respective sites.  
 
5.6 Data Collection and Reporting  
 
A daily list of patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD will be generated. Each morning at 06:00 the 
list is automatically emailed via secure transmission to the appropriate COPD pathway coordinator  at each 
participating facility  or stored on a secured server . Patient demographics, comorbid conditions and 
utilization will be obtained from the electronic medical record and billing systems. A monthly executive 
summary will be produced showing patient v olume  and related implementation metrics  such as:  
1. Rate of use of the COPD PowerPlan  
2. Rate of use of the respiratory therapy department COPD bronchodilator protocol  
3. Average l ength of stay  
4. Rate of follow -up visit within 5 days of discharge.  
5. Antibiotic order r ate during admission  
6. Steroid order rate during admission  
7. Short acting bronchodilator order rate during admission  
8. LAMA, LAMA/LABA, LABA/ICS order rate at discharge

7. INTERVENTION PLAN  
7.1. COPD CLINICAL PATHWA Y 
The pathway  includes the following components.  
• A data system that identifies patients with exacerbation and care gaps in real -time 
• A COPD pathway coordinator who works to close care gaps and ensure standardized approach.  
• A standardized care pathway inclusive of an EM R based order set, patient education, and discharge 
criteria.  
7.1.1.  EMR Based O rder Set 
The order set  includes an order within 24 hours of being admitted  of 
• A bronchodilator  albuterol, ipratropium, ipratropium -albuterol ) 
• An antibiotic  (amoxicillin -clavulanate, doxycycline, azithromycin, ampicillin -sulbactum)  
• A steroid  (prednisone, methylprednisolone)  
7.1.2.  Patient Education  
Education will be provided by the COPD pathway coordinator  and will be aligned to the 
treatment. The COPD pathway coordinator will use a set of standardized teaching tools and 
checklists in the process. Some components of the education include : 
• Action p lan (Living with COPD)  
• Home medication review  (steroids, antibiotics, etc.)   
• Respiratory equipment - technique, what to use and when, tips  
• Smoking cessation   
7.1.3.  Discharge Criteria  
At the time of discharge , the patient should have each of the following (unless otherwise stated):  

Version Number: 1.0  
Version Date: 5 -15-17 
  
18 • Stability on a long actin g bronchodilator  (e.g., spiriva, serevent)  
• Not requiring a short -acting bronchodilator more than qid  (e.g., albuterol, ipratropium, 
ipratropium -albuterol ) 
• Be on an oral steroid for 24 hours prior to discharge (e.g., prednisone, methylprednisolone)  
• A steroi d prescribed , supplied , or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• An antibiotic prescribed,  supplied , or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• A scheduled appointment with a care provider within 5 days of discharge  
• Received COPD education prior to discharge  
7.1.4.  Patient  Identification and Care Gaps  
Patients are identified as de scribed in the ‘Subjects’ section. Care gaps that are monitored daily 
include the initiation  of the COPD PowerPlan  and the Respiratory therapy department COP D 
bronchodilat or protocol. The PowerPlan includes order sets for  a bronchodilator, an antibiotic, 
and a steroid . 
7.1.5.  COPD Pathway Coordinator  
Once a patient is identified,  their clinical path will be guided by the pathway c oordinator. These 
individuals will monitor the use of the COPD clinical p athway and assure that all milestones 
within the patient experience are addressed  including assuring that discharge needs are met . The 
Pathway Coordinator will use the COPD Pathway Pr ogram which will inform the flowsheet used 
to track and record the patients clinical path. The COPD Pathway Coordinator  will be 
responsible for  report ing any pathway gaps to both the discharge facilitator and the clinician 
involved in the patient ’s care.   
8. STUDY GOVERNANCE  
This quality improvement trial will be conducted at Carolinas HealthCare System.  It will be run jointly by 
the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) and the Pulmonology Department. Daniel 
Howard , MD, ( Pulmonologist ) will ser ve as the Princip al Investigator and Jason Roberge as the C o-
Principal Investigator with oversight from the Executive Committee (EC).  The EC will consist of leaders 
across the System involved in the trial, quality improvement, and implementation (Table 1).  The EC will 
have the overall responsibility of trial oversight and direction.  Th e EC will support dissemination of 
project findings and next steps.  The EC will receive monthly progress reports and will meet periodically  
for status updates from the team and to set direction.  When appropriate, ad hoc committee meetings will 
be schedul ed to discuss pressing concerns.

19 9. SAFETY RISKS  
This project presents no more than minimal risk to patients who participate in the COPD clinical pathway. 
The deployment of the COPD clinical pathway at participating sites, utilizes care components that are 
already leveraged in CHS facilities. While based  on evidence and present in some facilities, t hese elements 
of care  are not consistently applied across sites and COPD patients .  
 
There is always the risk of disclosure of a patient’s private health information  (PHI) or medical 
information. However, the p rocesses identified in this protocol to enable the execution of this project,  do 
not increase inherent risk of disclosure. Carolinas HealthCare System utilizes several  hard and soft safety 
controls in the protection of patient information and medical records. Security controls include, but are not 
limited to, multiple system firewalls, access restrictions to patient records and information, locked offices 
and bui ldings housing research and  patient data, and multiple layers of username and password prot ected 
computer and system access.  The project team will ensure that appropriate handling of patient PHI follows 
standard CHS procedure. In the event of PHI disclosure, the appropriate departments will be informed per 
legislation and privacy regulations.  
9.1. Data and Safety Monitoring P lan 
The Co-PIs are responsible for the ethical and compliant conduct of this project in accordance with 
local, state, and federal laws and regulations. Ongoing supervision of the study progress and conduct 
will be facilitated thro ugh at least monthly meetings with key stakeholders and the PI s. These monthly 
meetings will address  data updates , milestones, and concerns. Because this project presents no more 
than minimal risk to patients, per the FDA Guidance for Clinical Sponsors: Es tablishment and 
Operations of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees, this study does not require oversight by a 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board or Committee.  
10. RESEARCH COMPLETION  
The Principal Investigator  has the right to close the project at any sit e and at any time.  
For any closure, the following applies:  
• Closures should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• All affected institutions must be informed as applicable , according to local law.   
• In case of a partial study or site closure, patients still participating in the COPD clinical pathway , or 
those who are considered in follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
 
The study will be considered complete when one or more of the following conditions is met:  
• The enrollment period has ended, and the data collection period is complete.  
• The IRB or Principal Investigator discontinues the study.  
• The Principal Investigator defines an administrative or clinical cut -off date.  
Upon study completion, a final report will be presented to the Executive Committee and all key 
stakeholders. The final report will detail all findings including primary, secondary and exploratory 
outcomes. The team will also prepare a manuscript for publication

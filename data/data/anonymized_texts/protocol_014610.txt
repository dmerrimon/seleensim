Title of Study:  A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized , Double Blind, Three -Arm Study to Evaluate 
the Efficacy a nd Safety of Tramadol Infusion  (AVE -901) versus Placebo in the Management of 
Postoperative Pain Following Bunionectomy  
Study center :  Approximately  6 centers in the United States  
Studied period:  
Estimated date first patient enrolls: Q3 2017 
Estimat ed date last patient enrolls: Q 2 2018  
Estimated date primary analysis: Q 2 2018 Phase of development:  3 
 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of intravenous (IV) tramadol 
(AVE -901) compared to placebo in the management of postoperative pain  following orthopedic 
(bunionectomy) surgery.  The Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) through 48 hours post first 
dose (SPID48) measured at rest will be used as the primary measure of efficacy.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are: 
• SPID through 24 ho urs post first dose (SPID24) measured at rest  
• Total consumption of rescue (supplemental) analgesia. This is the total amount of rescue 
analgesia given to the patient  after first dose of study medication through 48 hours post -
first dose.  
• Patient  Global Assessment of efficacy at 24 and 48 hours post first dose using a 5 -point 
scale.  The question to be posed is “How would you rate the study medication in terms of 
its effectiveness in controlling your pain?” (0=poor; 1=fair; 2=good; 3=very good; 
4=excellent).  
Additional analgesia endpoints are:  
• Time -specific pain intensity profile over time  
• Time (in minutes) to first rescue analgesia from the time of first dose of study 
medication.  
• Number (percent) of patients who require no rescue analgesia from T0 -T48. 
• Rate of consumption of rescue analgesia.  The total amount of rescue analgesia 
will be expressed as a function of duration of treatment  
• Time (in minutes) to meaningful pain relief after first dose.  
• Time (in minutes) to perceptible pain relief after  first dose.

Safety endpoints will include:  
• Adverse events (classified by the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred 
term) , including assessment of AE’s related to substance abuse .   
• Clinical laboratory, vital sign, PE, and ECG changes  
• Use of anti -emetic s and other concomitant medications  
• Local tolerability at the infusion site via pain, swelling, tenderness, and erythema.   
Population pharmacokinetic outcomes will be assessed through collection of plasma samples for a 
subset of the randomized patients.  Exposure -response relationships will be assessed for safety 
outcomes.  
Study Design:  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, double -blind, three -arm, randomized, placebo -controlled, 
multiple -dose, parallel -group trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and the efficacy of IV Tramadol 
(AVE -901) versus placebo in the management of postoperative pain in consenting patients 
undergoing a  unilateral primary first metatarsal bunionectomy  surgery.  The treatment groups will be:  
• AVE -901 50 mg , given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44.  
• AVE -901 25 mg, given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44.  
• Placebo, given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44.  
Approximately 405 patients wi ll be randomized (135 per treatment group).  
Each patient  will unde rgo the Screening Visit (Day -28 to Day  -1), the pre -operative assessment 
(within 24 hours prior to  surgery  start time ), the Surgical/Treatment Visit, the first day of which is 
when the bun ionectomy will be performed (Day 0), the primary treatment period through Hour 48 
(the last on treatment assessment, and the time of End of Treatment visit  assessments ), and the 
Follow -up Visit ( Day 14 ).  Confinement is anticipated to be a 4 -day 3 night st ay from Day - 1 to hour 
48. 
Screening will occur up to 28  days prior to surgery.  Following the pre -operative assessments, after 
the patient has met eligibility criteria , patient s will be randomized in a double -blinded fashion , 
stratified by study center,  in a 1:1 :1 ratio to the treatment groups.   
Following surgery, patients that have met post -surgical dosing  criteria will receive his or her  assigned 
study medication infusion regimen over a period of 48 hours . Patients will be confined at the 
healthcare f acility during  study drug administration, and will be discharged only if clinically stable .   
Efficacy will be assessed by patient reports of pain intensity (PI) performed at rest immediately prior 
to T0 (the first administration of study drug) and at 0.5,  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 
24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48 hours after first treatment (ie, post T0). PI  is 
reported by the patient on a numeric rating scale for pain (N PRS Pain , See Appendix 1 ) anchored at 0 
for no pain and 10 for the worst pain imaginable .  In addition, efficacy and safety will be measured by  
other parameters.    
Rescue medication ( Ibuprofen 400 mg Q4 PRN ) will be available any time after the initial dose of 
study medication to keep the patient  comfortable. However, patient s will be encouraged to wait at 
least 60 minutes after the initial dose of study medication before they  receive  rescue  therapy .  A pain

Patient  controlled analgesia (PCA) will not be allowed in this study.  
Study Periods  and Methodology  
There are 5 periods in this study:  Screening, Preoperative, Operative, Post -operative/Treatment 
Period, and Follow -up.  Procedures for each study period are described below.  
Screening : 
Screening will occur from Day -28 through Day - 1 and will be conducted as a clinic visit. Patient s 
will have the purpose and procedures of the study explained to them and, those who elect to 
participate in the study, will provide informed consent and be screened for participation according to 
the eligibility criteria. Patient s will undergo protocol specific education including but not limited to 
the various post -treatment efficacy  measures.   Screening will include eligibility assessment, medical 
history, physical examination, demographics, height and weight , BMI , vital signs (heart rate, systolic 
blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature , pulse oximetry ), ASA 
Physical Status, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology panel, chemistry panel, coagulation 
tests, infectious disease testing, urinalysis, urine drug screen, Alcohol breath test, serum pregnancy 
test (in females of childbearing potential), a nd prior/current treatments. All screening laboratory 
evaluations must be within acceptable limits as determined by the investigator prior to randomization.  
Preoperative : 
Preoperative assessments to confirm the patient’s eligibility will be performed within 24 hours of 
scheduled surgery start time.  This visit will include reassessment of eligibility  criteria , interim 
medical history, vital signs, brief physical exam, ASA Phy sical Status,  chemistry panel, hematology 
panel, coagulation tests, urinalysis, urine drug screen, Alcohol breath test, urine pregnancy test (in 
females of childbearing potential), and concomitant treatments.  These safety laboratory tests will not 
be used  for determining eligibility . Patients with Baseline laboratory values that are subsequently 
found to meet any exclusion criteria may be discontinued from the trial  at the discretion of the 
investigator, medical monitor and sponsor. A blood sample will be obtained during  the preoperative 
period and stored for possible analysis of CYP2D6 metabolizer status, in case such information is 
deemed to be of interest during the analysis. If all preoperative assessments meet eligibility (with the 
exception of the laboratory values noted) the subject will be randomized prior to surgery.  
 
Operative :  
Operative procedures are described in the Surgical and Anesthetic Regimen.  
Post-operative /Treatment Period : 
In addition to meeting all eligibility criteria prior to surg ery, patient s must  ALSO  meet all 
postsurgic al dosing  criteria . Treatment will occur from Hour  0 through Hour  44 (T0-T44).   
• Following surgery, patients will have their popliteal block withdrawn approximately  between  4 
and 5 AM . Post removal of the popliteal block, p atients must be assessed for the dosing eligibility 
criteria prior to dosing. Patients must be awake and alert,  and must  have a pain intensity of 5 or 
greater  on the NPRS and report a score of moderate or severe on a  4-point categorical rating scale 
(with categories of none, mild, moderate, or seve re) just before the first dose of the study drug.  
Patients who do not report pain at this level within 8 hours  of the removal of the block  will be 
discontinued  from the stu dy. 
• Antiemetic treatment with Reglan or Emend (not Zofran  or other 5HT 3 antagonists ) is allowed.

T0 will be time of start of infusion of first study drug administration.  Pain intensity will be recorded 
using a NPRS  from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10  is the worst pain imaginable  (See Appendix 1 ).  
Pain intensity assessments will be recorded immediately prior to first dose (baseline) and at the times 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments.  The patient must rest for 15 minutes (+/- 5 minutes) prior  
to NPRS assessments. The Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of efficacy will be  completed by the 
patient  at 24 hours and 48 hours post T0.  Ratings will be assessed as: 0=poor; 1=fair, 2=good, 
3=very good or 4=exc ellent.  
Two stopwatches will be started at the start of infusion of first study drug dose.  Patients will be 
instructed to stop the first stopwatch when pain relief is first perceptible and the second when pain 
relief  is considered meaningful.  Safety will be assessed  by recording vital signs including: respiratory 
rate, pulse oximetry reading, temperature, heart rate and blood pressure  throughout the study period.    
At the end of treatment (post T48), patients will undergo End of Treatment assessments, including a 
brief physical examination, vital signs measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG) NPRS, PGA, and 
clinical laboratory evaluations for safety. AEs and  concomitant medication use will be recorded. If 
feasible, any patient  who prematurely discontinues study medicatio n or the study prior to the T48 will 
undergo the procedures required at the end of treatment.   Post T48, pain management will be per 
investigator standard of care preference.  
Follow up:  
A final safety assessment via telephone call will be conducted on Day 14 (± 2  days); this will be a 
telephone contact.  
Rescue medication:  
Inadequate analgesia may be  treated with 400 mg Q4 of ibuprofen PRN  administered by a trained 
nurse or study clinician  to the patient s who request rescue medication any time after admi nistration of 
the initial dose of study medication.  However, patient s will be encouraged to avoid rescue 
medications for at least 60 minutes after their first dose of study drug.  A NPRS  will be obtained 
immediately (approximately 5 minutes)  prior  to admi nistering any rescue medication.  Patient s will 
continue to take study medication for the remainder of the 48 -hour period even if they take rescue 
medication.  Ibuprofen dosing is allowed: 400 mg PRN every 4 hours up to 2400 mg per day. The 
time of rescue m edication must be recorded in the case report form.  Investigator study team 
personnel will monitor the patient  carefully for 48 hours following the surgery to assess the patient 's 
condition and provide rescue medication whenever requested , within the abov e limits .  This will 
minimize the patient 's inconvenience caused due to pain.   
Pharmacokinetics:  
Approximately 33% of the total number of patients w ill be enrolled in the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
portion of this study at select sites.   Blood will be collected for analysis of tramadol and O -
desmethyltramadol (active metabolite) at  Hour 0, Hour 0.25, Hour 0.5, Hour 2.25, Hour 2.5, Hour 4,  
Hour 4.25,  Hour 4.5,  Hour 8, Hour 8.25, Hour 24.5,  Hour 44, Hour 44.25, H our 44.5, and Hour 48.  
Number of patient s (planned):  
A total of approximately 405 patient s in United States (US) undergoing bunionectomy who meet all 
of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria , randomized, have at least one pain intensity 
measurement  and receive at lea st a partial dose of study drug will be included in the study population. 
Patient s will be randomized to one of three  treatment arms ( AVE -901 50 mg , AVE -901 25 mg, or

• Physical examination  
• 12-lead ECG .  Of special note, an ECG will be performed between 20 and 30 minutes 
following the start of EACH dose during the first 24 hours of treatment.  
• Use of anti -emetics and other c oncomitant medications  
PK: 
• Plasma sampling in a subset (approximately 33%) of the population is planned at 
designated  time points.  Exposure -safety relationships will be assessed (including but not 
necessary limited to ECG, adverse event, and concomitant therapy/drug -drug interaction 
outcomes).

   Statistical methods:  
Sample Size Considerations:  
A sample size of 135 patients per arm (405 patients in total) provides over 90% power to detect a 
SPID48 difference of 250 between treatment with placebo and treatment with AVE -901, assuming a 
common SPID48 standard deviation of 600 (and thus an approximate 40% effect size), a n alpha of 
0.05 using a two -sided test of mean differences.   
General Statistical Methods 
The baseline for all variables will be the last measurement obtained prior to the patient receiving the 
first dose of randomized study drug.  
Patient disposition (inc luding t he number and percent of patient s who are randomized, who receive 
randomized treatment, who prematurely discontinue  and reasons for discontinuation , and who 
compl ete the study) will be tabulated by treatment group .  The number (%) of patients by ex posure 
will be tabulated.  
Baseline comparability among the two treatment groups with respect to demographic and other 
baseline characteristics will be assessed for quantitative variables with a two -way analysis of varian ce 
(ANOVA) with treatment group and study center as main effects. For categorical variables, the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will be used, stratified by center . 
Study Populations  
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population is defined as all randomized patient s who 
receive study medication.  Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment group 
they were randomized to.   
• The Safety Population is defined as all patient s who receive study medication.  
Patient s will be analyzed according to the actual treatment they receive.  
Alpha Levels  
There are 2 pairwise comparisons of interest:  
• High- dose tramadol (50 mg) vs placebo  
• Low-dose tramadol (25 mg) vs placebo  
All inferential assessments will be 2 -sided tests performed at the 0.05 alpha level.  A hierarchical 
alpha testing strategy will be utilized to control for the overall experiment -wise alpha.  As there are 
multiple tests being performed ( the single primary  efficacy variable pairwise test and the 3  key 
secondary efficacy tests), the following strategy will be applied:   
The high- dose tramad ol arm vs placebo comparison will be assessed for the primary endpoint at the 
0.05 alpha level.  If and only if the p -value is ≤ 0.05 for this pairwise comparison will the lower dose 
tramadol arm vs placebo comparison be assessed.  If the p -value for the h igh-dose arm is NOT 
significant, all testing will cease and it will be concluded that neither tramadol treatment arm provides 
better pain relief than placebo.  
If the primary endpoint is significant for the AVE -901 vs. placebo comparison  (in favor of the 
tramadol arm) for one or both pair -wise tests , then statistical testing will proceed to the secondary 
endpoints  within each pair -wise grouping , to be tested in the following order:  
• SPID24  
• Total consumption of rescue analgesia  
Protocol AVE -901-102 Phase 3  Orthopedic   Tramadol Infusion 
Avenue Therapeutics, Inc.   October 24, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  15  
   • Patient Global Assessment of efficacy at 24 and 48 hours (the two time points will be 
tested simultaneously)  
If a statistical test within each pairwise comparison is significant at the nominal 0.0 5 level, two-sided  
(in favor of the tramadol arm) , then test ing will proceed to the next endpoint in the list.  Once a non-
significant test occurs, endpoints lower in the list are considered not statistically significant.  
Note that while inferential comparison of the high dose to the low dose is not a key aspect of  the 
statistical analysis, assessment of the dose -response will be performed across the 3 doses in order to 
allow visual comparison of the outcomes for the primary and key secondary endpoints.  
Subgroups  
Analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints,  as well as treatment -emergent AE and serious 
AE incidence, will be provided by the following subgroups:  
• Gender  
• Race  
• Age (using the study median age)  
• Investigational center  
Efficacy  
Primary Endpoint  
SPID 48 (the sum of the time -weighted pain intensity diffe rences for the time period 0 -48 hours)  is the 
primary efficacy endpoint .   
Handling of Missing Data  
For the primary causal estimate in this study (to reflect the true treatment effects of tramadol 
compared to placebo), missing values within a patient  during the 48- hour treatment period will be 
handled in the following manner:  
• When rescue medication is used, the last pain intensity measure prior to the use of 
rescue medication will be used (imputed) for the subsequent protocol -specified time 
points for  measurement of pain intensity through 4 -hours after the time of the rescue 
medication.  
All other missing data will be imputed utilizing multiple imputation methods .  Multiple imputation 
provides a useful strategy for analyzing data sets with missing value s. Instead of filling in a single 
value for each missing value, Rubin’s (1976) multiple imputation strategy replaces each missing value 
with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the correct  value to impute . 
For patients  with arbit rary missing data patterns (missing at random, MAR), a pattern -mixture 
approach will be taken to the imputation.  The first step will be to apply a Markov C hain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) method (Schafer 1997) that assumes multivariate normality will be  used to im pute all 
missing values to make the imputed  (resulting) data sets have  strictly  monotone missing patterns.  The 
resulting monotone missing pattern will then, in a second imputation step, be used to impute the 
remaining missing values; specifically, a regre ssion -based method for continuous variables  will be 
applied.  
For patients  with missing data as a result of discontinuation due to adverse event (missing not at 
random, MNAR), the pattern -mixture approach will also be taken to the imputation (as for the 
Protocol AVE -901-102 Phase 3  Orthopedic   Tramadol Infusion

   monotone MAR data) , with  the difference that while a similar regression -based method for 
continuous variables  will be applied, a scaled (constant) adjustment to the imputed values will be 
made such that the outcomes that are imputed are distributionally ‘worse’ than those imputed for the 
monotone MAR data.  This scaled adjustment will increase each imputed value (from the regression) 
for these MNAR data by a constant of ‘1’, eg, if the regression provides an imputed value of 4.6 for a 
given missing value for a  patient  at a given timepoint, the MNAR imputed value will be set to 4.6 + 1 
= 5.6 for that patient at that time point.  This will, in effect, guarantee that the overall distribution  of 
missing values for discontinuations due to adverse event is WORSE than  that for other reasons.  
The SAS software system will be used to perform this imputation.  Because the imputation of missing 
data is a key aspect to the analysis of pain data, explicit details regarding this imputation are provided 
via sample SAS code that  is intended to demonstrate the application of these strategies.  Variable 
definitions are:  
• TRT=treatment group (1 or 0)  
• Pain_1 is the first time point for the pain score  
• Pain_2 is the second time point for the pain score  
• Pain_last is the last time point f or the pain score. Additional pain scores (between 
Pain_1 and Pain_last) would be included in this model according to the time points 
for collection.  
The first step will be to impute partially in order to obtain a monotone missing data pattern.  
proc mi data=DATAIN out=DATAIN_MONO nimpute=100 seed=123;  
var TRT Pain_1 Pain_2 …. Pain_last; 
mcmc chain=multiple impute=monotone;  
run;  
The second step will be to impute the remaining (monotone) missing data that is MAR for each of the 
100 imputed datasets from the  first step.  
proc mi data=DATAIN_MONO out=DATAIN_REG seed=465 nimpute=1;  
by _Imputation_;  
var TRT Pain_1 Pain_2 …. Pain_last;  
class TRT;  
monotone regression;  
run; 
In the case of missing data due to an adverse event, the following step will be used:  
proc mi data=DATAIN_MONO out=DATAIN_REG seed=465 nimpute=1;  
by _Imputation_;  
var TRT Pain_1 Pain_2 …. Pain_last;  
class TRT;  
monotone regression (pain1 pain2 … Pain_last);  
mnar adjust (pain1 pain2 … Pain_last / shift=1);  
run; 
Note that the regressions d o not include the treatment variable, and thus the imputed data at each time 
point will be based on the distribution of all data rather than treatment- group specific distributions.  A 
total of 100 imputed datasets will be created using these imputed data a nd analyzed according to the 
primary method of statistical analysis.  
Primary Method of Statistical Analysis  
Each of the 100 imputed datasets will be analyzed as follows:

• An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to test the primary efficacy 
endpoint.  The model will use treatment and study center as main effects, and baseline 
pain intensity ( NPRS  scale 0 to 10) as the covariate  (See Appendix 1 ).  Data from all 
three treatment groups will be included in the same ANCOVA model for purposes of the 
testing procedures.  
The 100 resulting treatment effect parameters and standard errors from these ANCOVA will be 
combined to provide a distribution of param eters (and standard errors) upon which the primary 
hypothesis of treatment effect will be determined.  
Key Secondary Endpoints  
The key secondary endpoints will be assessed  as follows:  
• 24-hour pain intensity (SPID24) will be assessed in a similar manner as t he primary 
endpoint.  
• Total consumption of rescue analgesia will be analyzed nonparametrically using the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test .   
• Patient  Global Assessment at scheduled evaluations will be assessed for treatment 
group differences using an AN COVA comparison with center  and the baseline pain 
score as the stratification factor . 
Tertiary endpoints  
• Time -specific pain intensity profile over time will be assessed using a mixed models 
repeated measures (MMRM), with fixed effects for treatment, time, t he treatment by 
time interaction, and random patient  effect.  Pairwise comparisons at each time point 
will be determined from the MMRM, and model -based means (LSMeans) and 
standard errors will be plotted for visual comparison of the treatment group 
outcome s. 
• The time to pain relief (meaningful and perceptible), as well as time to first rescue  
medication , will be assessed using a log -rank statistic, stratified by center.  A Kaplan -
Meier plot will be provided for each of these outcomes.  The time to event ana lyses 
will include the times to events of death or withdrawal from study as endpoints.

Patient s will be censored at 4 hours for time to pain rel ief, while time to first rescue  
medication  will be censored at 48 hours.   
• The number (%) of patients who requi re no rescue analgesia during the 48 -hour 
period following T0 will be assessed using a CMH test stratified by center.  
• The rate of consumption of rescue analgesia will  be analyzed nonparametrically 
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.   
Pharmacokinetics  
For th e subset  of patients undergoing PK blood sampling, descriptive statistics will be calculated for 
the plasma concentrations of tramadol and O -desmethyltramadol collected at the designated sample 
collection times .  An assessment of the exposure -response prof ile for key safety outcomes (ECG 
changes, select adverse events, drug -drug interactions) will be performed for both parent and 
metabolite.  Population pharmacokinetic methods (via exploration of potential intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors) may be applied if numerical assessments demonstrate potential associations between 
exposure and response.  
Safety  
All AEs will be classified with respect to the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred 
term.  The number and percent of patient s who report treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
will be summarized for each treatment group. Additional summaries by severity, relationship, and 
subgroup will be presented.   Serious AEs (SAEs) will be summarized similarly.  
Exploratory analyses of use of anti -emetics may be performed.  Other safety data presentations will 
be descriptive in nature and no formal statistical tests will be performed.  
ECG results will be analyzed on an ongoing basis by a central ECG reader on an individual patient 
level and as well as by group analysis  
Clinical laboratory  and vital sign s will be summarized  descriptively by time point .  Local tolerability 
at the infusion site will be assessed for pain, swelling, tenderness, and erythema.  Adverse events 
suggestive of abuse liability w ill be summarized separately.  These abuse -related AEs include 
euphoria -type adverse events, hallucinations and inappropriate affect, and withdrawal events after 
abrupt discontinuation of treatment.

   4. INTRODUCTION  
Effective postoperative pain control is a critical need as most patients undergoing surgical 
procedures experience pain immediately following the procedure, and require treatment for 
several days.  For instance, patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or bunionectomy 
typically demonstrate a need for short -term analgesia, which is critical for earlier mobilization 
and rehabilitation. In this setting, reducing pain intensity without providing extensive medical 
oversight required for some methods of treatment (such as neuraxial anesthesia) and prevention 
of effects such as opiate -induced respiratory depression and dependency would be highly 
beneficial (Sinatra et al., 2002).  
Several options are available for postoperative pain management (Singelyn et al., 1998;  Sinatra 
et al., 2002). Options include intermittent “on- demand” analgesia, including oral and via patient 
controlled analgesia (PCA) or by nurse -administered bolus injections of systemic opioids such as 
morphine. Second, continuous epidural analgesia with opioids and/or local anesthetics is 
effective, although this requires continued presence of the epidural catheter and oversight by an 
anesthesiologist. A third alternative is to provide a combination of nerve blocks with long -acting 
local anesthetics and/ or opioids initiated intra -operatively and continued into the immediate 
postoperative period.  
4.1. Tramadol Infusion  
Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic with a dual mechanism of action, comprised of 
μ-opioid activity and monoamine (serotonin and noradrenalin) reuptake inhibition. Tramadol is 
an analog of the phenanthrene group of opium alkaloids, which includes morphine and codeine, 
and is structurally related to these opioids (Grond and Sablotzki, 2004). Like codeine, there is a 
substitution of t he methyl group on the phenol ring that imparts a relatively weak affinity for 
opioid receptors.  
Tramadol was originally developed by the German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal GmbH 
in the late 1970s and is marketed globally under the trade names TRAMAL®  and others outside 
of the United States (US). The approved doses of tramadol are 50 mg or 100 mg administered as 
a slow injection every 4 -6 hours (Tramadol Core Product Label, 2008). 
In the US, tramadol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) and marketed as an 
oral tablet (the only available formulation) for moderate to moderately severe pain in adults. 
Tramadol was first approved in the US in April 1995 under the trade name ULTRAM® (Ortho-
McNeil -Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ). Tramadol is also an active agent in an extended release 
(ER) product, Ultram® ER, and as a combination product with acetaminophen, ULTRACET®. 
In the US, tramadol is only available as immediate release tablets or extended release tablets.  
Tramadol injection (IV/IM/SC) i s approved and used for the management of moderate to severe 
acute postoperative pain in several regions, including Europe, India and Australia/New Zealand; 
however, this dosage form is not available in the US. Tramadol ampoules or vials for parenteral 
(intravenous [IV], intramuscular [IM] and subcutaneous [SC]) administration and preservative -
free solutions for injection by the various spinal routes (epidural, intrathecal, caudal, etc.) are 
available forms in these regions. Other tramadol formulations appr oved in several countries 
include tablets, capsules, effervescent powders, and suppositories (Grond and Sablotzki, 2004; 
Rosenberg, 2009).

   There is extensive data demonstrating that tramadol use is not associated with the classic- opioid 
side effects seen with more potent opioids. There are numerous reports of the safety and efficacy 
of tramadol in this setting (Scott and Perry, 2000; Grond and Sablotzki, 2004). 
4.2. Nonclinical Summary  
Tramadol is a centrally -acting synthetic analgesic of the aminocyclohexanol group with opioid-
like effects. Tramadol is extensively metabolized following administration, which results in a 
number of enantiomeric metabolites that display different opioid -receptor binding properties, and 
monoaminergic reuptake inhibition (Grond and Sablotzki, 2004).  
Both enantiomers of tramadol and (+)- M1 are responsible for the analgesic effect. The primary 
metabolite [(+) -M1 or (+)- O-desmethyltramadol] of tramadol confers significant μ -opioid 
activity; (+) -tramadol confers weak μ -opioid activity and significant serotonin reuptake 
inhibition; and (−)- tramadol is responsible for the inhibition of noradrenaline re -uptake (Gillen et 
al., 2000; Raffa, 2008). Nonclinical studies have shown that antinociception induced by tramadol 
is only partially antago nized by the opiate antagonist, naloxone, indicating that non -opioid 
mechanisms are also involved in its pharmacodynamic action (Collart et al., 1992).  
Consistent with the known clinical effects of opioids, non -clinical safety pharmacology studies 
have shown that tramadol at high doses affects the central nervous system (CNS), producing 
sedation, impaired mobility, vomiting (dogs), decreased activity, and convulsions (Matthiesen et 
al., 1998). Also consistent with clinical effects, changes in blood press ure have been observed in 
cardiovascular studies in rats at high doses (Raimundo et al., 2006).  
The toxicity of tramadol has been summarized by Matthiesen et al. (1998). The single dose 
toxicity of tramadol was similar in all species tested, independent of  the route of administration. 
Notable acute findings included restlessness, unsteady gait, reduced spontaneous activity, 
exophthalmus, mydriasis, salivation, vomiting (dog), tremor, convulsions, slight cyanosis and 
dyspnea. The principle findings in repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were 
behavioral/clinical signs and convulsions at doses of ≥25 mg/kg/day. The kidney and liver were 
identified as potential target organs in rats, with mild effects (minimal tubular vacuolization and 
perivenular hydropic degeneration, respectively) following repeat intraperitoneal dosing at high 
doses of tramadol.  
There was no evidence of genotoxic potential for tramadol in standard in vitro and in vivo 
studies (Matthiesen et al., 1998). Carcinogenicity bioassays in m ice and rats showed no evidence 
of carcinogenic potential. An extensive reproductive and teratology program revealed no safety 
concerns with respect to fertility or teratogenic effects after oral administration (Matthiesen et 
al., 1998; Yamamoto et al., 1972). Toxicity to offspring only occurred at doses associated with 
maternal toxicity.  
In conclusion, none of the results in non- clinical toxicity studies indicated a safety concern 
regarding administration of AVE -901 at the intended clinical dose.  
4.3. Pharmacok inetic Profile  
Following oral administration, tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. The 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of tramadol were evaluated in healthy male volunteers (n=10) in a 
crossover design using 100 mg (PO) or IV doses (Lintz et al., 1986). Peak serum concentrations 
Protocol AVE -901-102 Phase 3  Orthopedic   Tramadol Infusion

CONFIDENTIAL  28  
   (Tmax) were reached approximately 2 hours after oral dosing and the peak serum concentration 
(Cmax) for PO tramadol was 280±49 ng/mL. The terminal half- life was 5.1 hours for PO and 5.2 
hours for IV administration. The area und er the serum tramadol concentration -time curve (AUC) 
was 2488±774 ng·h/mL for PO and 3709±977 ng·h/mL for IV administration. Total clearance 
was 467±124 mL/min for PO and 710±174 mL/min for IV administration. The absolute 
bioavailability of the oral dose w as 68±13%, based on comparison of the AUC values, while the 
estimated absorption of the oral dose was 86- 88%. The difference between absorption and 
bioavailability was attributed to first pass metabolism, which was estimated to be ~20%. 
However, the absolu te bioavailability approaches 90 -100% with continuous dosing, probably due 
to saturation of first pass metabolism (Liao et al., 1992). Other studies have corroborated these 
findings (Grond and Sablotzki, 2004). 
Tramadol undergoes hepatic metabolism and bot h the parent drug and the active metabolite are 
excreted by the kidneys. The only known active metabolite, M1 (O -desmethyltramadol), is 
produced by the action of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 isozyme of the cytochrome P450 enzyme 
system. It has a half -life of approximately 6.7 hours after oral administration (single dose of 100 
mg), compared to a half -life of 5.6 hours for tramadol. Hepatic impairment results in decreased 
metabolism of both the parent compound and the active metabolite. Elimination half -life 
incre ases approximately 2 -fold in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients who 
metabolize drugs poorly via CYP2D6 (Caucasian population prevalence ~ 8%) may obtain 
reduced benefit from tramadol due to reduced formation of M1 (Ultram® Prescribing 
Information, Ortho McNeil -Janssen, 2009). 
A Phase 1 study was performed to determine a treatment regimen of IV tramadol that would be 
comparable to the approved 100 mg dose of oral tramadol at steady state [Study title: “A Phase 
1, Open- Label, Single Center, Three- Period, Multi -dose Crossover Study to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics of Two Difference AVE- 901 (Tramadol Infusion) Regimens versus Oral 
Tramadol Tablets” (Study AVE -901-101)]. 
The two different IV re gimens were evaluated and compared to the oral regimen. A total of 18 
patient s, ages 24 to 55 years (inclusive) were enrolled (3 patient s to each of the 6 sequences). 
The study included 11 males and 7 females. 17 patient s completed all 3 treatment sequences.  
The treatment regimens evaluated were:  
1. 75 mg IV REGIMEN: IV tramadol 75 mg administered at Hour 0, followed by 75 mg at 
Hour 3 and Hour 6, and 75 mg every 6 hours thereafter through Hour 42  
2. 50 mg IV REGIMEN: IV tramadol 50 mg administered at Hour 0, fol lowed by 50 mg at 
Hour 2, 50 mg at Hour 4, and 50 mg every 4 hours thereafter through Hour 44  
3. ORAL REGIMEN: Oral tramadol 100 mg (50 mg tablets x 2) at Hour 0, 6, and every 6 
hours thereafter through Hour 42  
Examination of the parent (tramadol) as well as the primary metabolite, M1 (O -
desmethyltramadol), was performed over the 48- hour treatment period.  A focus of the analysis 
was on assessment of C max values (to ensure the C max for the IV formulation was similar to that 
of the oral formulation) as well as on early concentrations during the first doses (to ensure 
adequate medication would be provided during the initial 6 to 12 hours of treatment as the drugs

   reached steady -state concentrations). Overall exposure to tramadol was estimated primarily from 
average trough plasma concentrations.   
Figure  1 provides the mean plasma tramadol time- concentration profiles for the 100 mg oral, 50 
mg IV, and 75 mg IV regimens from Study AVE 901 -101. Mean plasma tramadol concentrations 
were higher after the 75 mg IV regimen compared to the 50 mg IV regimen and 100 mg PO q6h.  
As evidenced from the trough/pre -dose samples between 24 and 42 h, the mean tramadol trough 
conc entrations were very similar for the 50 mg IV regimen and 100 mg PO q6h but somewhat 
lower for the 75 mg IV regimen.   
Tramadol peak and trough concentrations for the 50 mg IV and the 100 mg PO q6h regimens 
were very similar at the end of the pharmacokinet ic sampling period, between approximately 44 
and 48 h.

Figure  2 provides the mean plasma O -desmethyltramadol time- concentration profiles for the 100 
mg oral, 50 mg IV, and 75 mg IV regimens from Study AVE 90 1-101. The mean plasma O -
desmethyltramadol concentrations were higher for the 75 mg IV regimen following the 3rd dose 
at 6 h, but there was appreciable overlap of the trough concentrations for the 75 mg IV and 50 
mg IV regimens between 24 and 42 h. The pre -dose concentrations as well as the concentrations 
after the last dose at 42 h were higher for 100 mg PO q6h compared to both IV arms, presumably 
due to first pass metabolism which results in a higher fraction of the active metabolite in 
systemic circulati on after oral administration.

The 50 mg IV regimen provided favorable C max and AUC values over the full 48 hour treatment 
period. Specifically:   
• Overall C max was comparable between the 50 mg IV and 100 mg PO regimens  but 
was achieved earlier with the IV regimen  
• Expos ure to tramadol at steady state (or near steady state, in the case of the oral 
regimen), based on C max and AUC, was also comparable between the 50 mg IV 
regimen and 100 mg PO q6h   
• The 50 mg IV regimen, as compared to the 75 mg IV regimen, resulted in less  peak to 
trough fluctuation with lower C max

   • Exposure to O -desmethyltramadol was higher after 100 mg PO q6h compared to 
either IV treatment, 50 mg IV or 75 mg IV regimens, based on AUC and C max values  
Based on these findings, the 50 mg IV regimen will be s tudied in this current protocol. 
4.4. Rationale for this Study  
This double -blind efficacy and safety study will be conducted in addition to one other  efficacy 
Phase 3 stud y and one open- label safety study.  This efficacy  study is being performed in an 
orthopedic model (AVE -901-102), while the other Phase 3 efficacy study is being performed in a 
soft tissue model ( AVE -901-103).  The safety study ( AVE -901-104) will be performed in a 
range of surgical types.   
Data from this current study will be co mbined with  data from the other studies into an overall 
safety  and efficacy  database for tramadol infusion.

   5. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of intravenous (IV) 
tramadol (AVE -901) compared to placebo in the management of postoperative pain following 
orthopedic (bunionectomy) surgery.   
The Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) through 48 hours post first dose (SPID48) 
measured at rest will be used as the primary measure of efficacy.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• SPID through 24 hours post first dose (SPID24) measured at rest  
• Total consumption of rescue (supplemental) analgesia. This is the total amount of 
rescue analgesia given to the patient after first dose of study medication through 48 
hours post -first dose.  
• Patient Global Assessment of efficacy at 24 and 48 hours post first dose using a 5-
point scale.  The question to be posed is “How would you rate the study medication in 
terms of its effectiveness in controlling your pain?” (0=poor; 1=fair; 2=good; 3=very 
good; 4=excellent).  
Additional analgesia endpoints are:  
• Time- specific pain intensity profile over time  
• Time (in minutes) to first rescue analgesia from the time of first dose of study 
medication.  
• Number (percent) of patient s who require no rescue analgesia from T0 -T48. 
• Rate of consumption of rescue analgesia.  The total amount of rescue analgesia will 
be expressed as a function of duration of treatment  
• Time (in minutes) to meaningful pain relief after first dose.  
• Time (in minutes) to perceptible pain relief after first dose.  
Safety endpoints will include:  
• Adverse events (classified by the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred 
term), including assessment of AE’s related to substance abuse.   
• Clinical laboratory, vit al sign, PE and ECG changes  
• Use of anti -emetics and other concomitant medicine  
• Local tolerability at  the infusion site via pain, swelling, tenderness, and erythema.   
Population pharmacokinetic outcomes will be assessed through collection of plasma samples  for 
a subset of the randomized patients.  Exposure -response relationships will be assessed for safety 
outcomes.

   6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, double- blind, three -arm, randomized, placebo- controlled, 
multip le-dose, parallel -group trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and the efficacy of IV 
Tramadol (AVE -901) versus placebo in the management of postoperative pain in consenting 
patients undergoing a unilateral primary first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery .  The treatment 
groups will be:  
• AVE -901 50 mg, given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44. 
• AVE -901 25 mg, given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44. 
• Placebo, given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44. 
Approximately 405 patients will be randomized (135 per treatment group).  
Each patient will undergo the Screening Visit (Day -28 to Day -1), the pre -operative assessment 
(within 24 hours prior to surgery  start time), the Surgical/Treatment  Visit, the first day of which 
is when the bunionectomy will be performed (Day 0), the primary treatment period through Hour 
48 (the last on treatment assessment, and the End of Treatment visit), and the Follow -up Visit 
(Day 14).  
Screening will occur up to  28 days prior to surgery.  Following the pre -operative assessments, 
and after the patient has met eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized in a double- blinded 
fashion, stratified by study center, in a 1:1:1 ratio to the treatment groups.   
Following surgery, patients that have met the post -surgical dosing  criteria will receive his or her  
assigned study medication infusion regimen over a period of 48 hours. Patients will be confined 
at the healthcare facility during study drug administration,  and will be discharged only if 
clinically stable.   
Efficacy will be assessed by patient reports of pain intensity (PI) performed immediately prior to 
T0 (the first administration of study drug) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 
24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48 hours after first treatment (ie, post T0). PI is 
reported by the patient on a numeric rating scale for pain (N PRS Pain) anchored at 0 for no pain 
and 10 for the worst pain imaginable  (See Appendix 1 ).  In addition, efficacy and safety will be 
measured by other parameters.   
Rescue medication (Ibuprofen 400 mg Q4 PRN) will be available any time after the initial dose 
of study medication to keep the patient comfortable. H owever, patients will be encouraged to 
wait at least 60 minutes after the initial dose of study medication before they receive rescue 
therapy.  An NPRS measure will be obtained immediately (approximately  5 minutes) prior to 
each administration of rescue medication.  Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) will not be 
allowed in this study.  
Approximately 33% of the total number of patients will be enrolled in the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
portion of this study at select sites.  Blood will be collected for analysis of tramadol and O -
desmethyltramadol (active metabolite) at Hour 0, Hour 0.25, Hour 0.5, Hour 2.25, Hour 2.5, 
Hour 4, Hour 4.25, Hour 4.5, Hour 8, Hour 8.25,  Hour 24.5, Hour 44, Hour 44.25, Hour 44.5, 
and Hour 48.

   6.2. Number of Patient s 
A total of approximately 4 05 patients in United States (US) undergoing elective orthopedic 
surgery who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, randomized, have at 
least one pain intensity measurement and receive at least a partial dose of study drug will be 
included in the study population.  
6.3. Treatment Assignment and Randomization  
Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms (AVE -901 50 mg AVE -901 25 mg, or 
placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio (approximately 135 patients per treatment group).  Randomization wi ll 
be stratified by study center.  
6.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
If the Investigator , Study Medical Monitor, or Avenue  Therapeutics discovers conditions arising 
during the study, which indicate that the clinical investigation should be halted, the study must 
be terminated after appropriate consultation between Avenue  Therapeutics , Study Medical 
Monitor, and the Investigator s.  Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not  
limited to:  
• The finding of an unacceptable risk to the patient s enrolled in the study,  
• Failure to enroll patient s at an acceptable rate,  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements and good clinical practices, or;  
• A decision on the part of the Avenue Therapeutics to suspend or discontinue 
development of the drug. 
6.4.1. Individual Patient  Stopping Rules  
If a patient  experiences  a serious  or severe adverse  event assessed as possibly, probably  or 
definitely  related  to study  drug, the Medical  Monitor and Investi gator will review  the patient ’s 
medical  record and determine whether the patient should have study  treatment  either temporarily  
interrupted or  permanently  discontinued.  
6.5. Schedule of Events  
Table 4  provides the schedule of events.   Note that patient s discontinuing prematurely from the 
study will have all End of  Treatment  assessments performed.

   6.6.4. Post-operative/Treatment Period  
In addition to meeting all eligibility criteria prior to surgery, patients must ALSO meet all 
postsurgical dosing  criteria. Treatment will occur from Hour 0 through Hour 44 (T0-T44).   
• Following surgery, patients will have their popliteal block withdrawn at 
approximately  between  4 AM  and 5 AM . Post removal of the popliteal block, Patients 
must be assessed for the dosing eligibility criteria prior to dosing. Patients must be 
awake and alert, and must have a pain intensity of 5 or greater and report a score of 
moderate or severe on a 4- point categorical rating scale (with categories of none, 
mild, moderate, or severe) just before the first dose of the study drug.  Patients who 
do not report pain at this level within 8 hours of the removal of the block will be 
discontinued (ie, not treated).  
• Antiemetic treatment with Reglan or Emend (not Zofran  or other 5HT3 antagonists ) 
is allowed.  
During the Treatment phase, pati ents will undergo:  
• NPRS -  T0 will be time of start of infusion of first study drug administration.  Pain 
intensity will be recorded using a N PRS from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the 
worst pain imaginable.  Pain intensity assessments will be reco rded immediately prior to 
first dose (baseline) and at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments.  The 
patient must rest for 15 minutes (+/ - 5 minutes) prior to assessments.  
• The Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of efficacy will be completed by the patient at 24 
hours and 48 hours post T0.  Ratings will be assessed as: 0=poor; 1=fair, 2=good, 3=very 
good or 4=excellent.  
• Two stopwatches will be started at the start of infusion of first study drug dose.  Patient s 
will be instructed to stop the first stopwatch when pain relief is first perceptible and the 
second when pain relief is considered meaningful. 
• Vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral temperature (after seated 
or supine for 5 minutes) and SpO2 as per the schedule of events  
• Study Drug dosing at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44 hours  
• 12 lead ECG (after supine for 5 minutes) at 20 to 30 minutes after the start  of each dos e 
for the first 24 hours  
• AEs 
• Concomitant medication use  
• Rescue medication use  
• For those patients enrolled in the PK portion of this study  (at select sites), b lood will be 
collected for analysis of tramadol and O -desmethyltramadol (active metabolite) at:  
Hour 0, Hour 0.25, Hour 0.5, Hour 2.25, Hour 2.5, Hour 4, Hour 4.25, Hour 4.5, 
Hour 8, Hour 8.25, Hour 24.5, Hour 44, Hour 44.25, Hour 44.5, and Hour 48.

CONFIDENTIAL  40  
   At the End o f Treatment  or Early Termination , patient s will undergo:  
• A brief (symptom driven) physical examination  (may be completed any time prior to 
discharge )  
• Vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral temperature (after 
seated or supine for 5 minutes) and SpO2 
• 12-lead ECG  (after supine for 5 minutes)  
• Blood samples for hematology, clinical chemistry , urinalysis, and pregnancy test  
(serum) 
• Pain Intens ity NPRS and Patient Global Assessment  
• AEs 
• Concomitant medication use  
• For those patients enrolled in the PK portion of this study (at select sites), blood will 
be collected for analysis of tramadol and O -desmethyltramadol (active metabolite)  
At time points  when multiple assessments are required, the order of assessments will be: Pain 
assessment, vital signs, blood draw,  and then study drug administration  
If feasible, any patient who prematurely discontinues study medication or the study prior to the 
T48 wil l undergo the procedures required at the end of treatment.   Post T48, pain management 
will be per investigator standard of care preference.  
6.6.4.1. Rescue medication during the Treatment Period  
Inadequate analgesia may be treated with 400 mg of ibuprofen q 4 hours PRN administered by a 
trained nurse or study clinician to the patients who request rescue medication after administration 
of the initial dose of study medication.  However, patients will be encouraged to avoid rescue 
medications for at least 60 m inutes after their first dose of study drug.  A NPRS measure  will be 
obtained immediately (approximately  5 minutes) prior to administering any rescue medication.  
Patients will continue to take study medication for the remainder of the 48 -hour period even if 
they take rescue medication.  Ibuprofen dosing is allowed: 400 mg PRN every 4 hours up to 
2400 mg per day. The time of rescue medication must be recorded in the case report form.  
Investigator study team personnel will monitor the patient carefully for 48 hours following the 
surgery to assess the patient's condition and provide rescue medication whenever requested, 
within the above limits.  This will minimize the patient's inconvenience due to pain.   
6.6.5. Follow up  
A final safety assessment will be conducted  on Day 14 (± 2 days) via a telephone call.

8.2. Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications, whether prescription, over -the-counter, herbal treatments or other 
therapy, taken  or used by the patient within 30 days of screening through end of study 
assessments (f/u phone call Day 14) will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and in the 
Concomitant Medications eCRF.  Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Dictionary.  
Rescue medication (Ibuprofen 400 mg Q4 PRN) will be available q 4 hours  after the initial dose 
of study medication to keep the patient comfortable. However, patients will be encouraged to 
wait at least 60 minutes after the initial dose of study medication before they receive rescue 
therapy. The rescue medication is the only analgesic allowed within the study.  Other non- pain

   relieving medications deemed necessary for the patient’s welfare are permitted, other than 
medications specified in the inclusion/excl usion criteria. Postoperative adverse events (AEs) 
such as nausea, vomiting and pruritus should be managed using standard of care, excluding 
medications specifically noted in the study protocol.  
If medication is needed to treat any adverse events during th e study, patient study continuation 
will be evaluated.  
8.3. Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance with study medication during the treatment periods is expected to be high, 
as patient s will be dosed directly in the clinic under well -controlled conditions.  The date and 
start/stop time of study drug administration will be recorded on the eCRF.   
8.4. Overdose  
Tramadol products in excessive doses, either alone or in combination with other CNS 
depressants, including alcohol, are a cause of drug- related deaths. Acute over dosage with 
tramadol can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or 
coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, seizures, bradycardia, 
hypotension, cardiac arrest, and death. Serious potential consequences of over dosage with 
tramadol are CNS depression, respiratory depression and death. Some deaths have occurred as a 
consequence of the accidental ingestion of excessive quantities of tramadol alone or in 
combination with other drugs, while others were associated with abuse of tramadol.  Review of 
case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when tramadol is 
abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids (Ultram® 
Presc ribing Information, 2009). 
Of note, while naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by over dosage with 
tramadol, the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration. In animals 
convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of tramadol could be suppressed with 
barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone. Naloxone administration did 
not change the lethality of an overdose in mice.  Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an 
overdose because it removes less than 7% of the administered dose in a 4 -hour dialysis period 
(Ultram® Prescribing Information, 2009).  
Additional details may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
8.5. Randomization, Blinding and Unblinding  
Patients will be randomized to one of 3 treatment groups, as follows:  
• AVE -901 50 mg, given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44. 
• AVE -901 25 mg, given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44. 
• Placebo, given at Hours 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44. 
Patients will be randomized to one of the three treatment arms (AVE -901 50 mg, AVE -901 25 
mg, or placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio (approximately 135 patients per treatment group).  
Randomization will be stratified by study center.   The study w ill remain blinded until all patients 
have completed their treatment period and completed all study procedures and the clinical

   11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
The primary e ndpoint  in this study is SPID48 for pain at rest .  Pain intensity will be recorded 
using a N PRS from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable  (See 
Appendix 1 ).   
Key s econdary e ndpoints  are: 
• SPID through 24 hours post first dose (SPID24) at rest  
• Total consumption of rescue (supplemental) analgesia. This is the total amount of 
rescue analgesia given to the patient after first dose of study medication through 48 
hours post -first dose.  
• Patient Global Assessment of efficacy at 24 and 48 hours.  The Patient Global 
Assessment (PGA) of efficacy will be completed by the patient at 24 hours and 48 
hours post T0.  Ratings will be assessed as: 0=poor; 1=fair, 2=good, 3=very good or 
4=excellent.  
Tertiary e ndpoints  (additio nal analgesia endpoints ) are:  
• Time-specific pain intensity profile over time  
• Clock time (in minutes) to first use of rescue medication from the time of first dose of 
study medication.  
• Number of patients who require no rescue analgesia from T 0-T48 
• The rate of consumption of rescue analges ia 
• Time (in minutes) to meaningful pain relief after first dose.  Two stopwatches will be 
started at the start of infusion of first study drug dose.  Patient s will be instructed to 
stop the first stopwatch when pain relief is first perceptible and the seco nd when pain 
relief is considered meaningful.  
• Time (in minutes) to perceptible pain relief after first dose

12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
12.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  Adverse events may include safety findings 
considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator.  An adverse drug event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not it is related to 
the medicinal product.  Reporting an adverse event does not necessarily reflect a conclusion by 
the Investigator that the event is causally related to the drug.  
Protocol AVE -901-102 Phase 3  Orthopedic   Tramadol Infusion 
Avenue Therapeutics, Inc.   October 24, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  54  
   All adverse events should be captured and documented along with any supporting 
documentation.  Adverse events should be spontaneously reported or elicited by non -suggestive 
probing.  Signs or symptoms associated with a worsening in either severity or frequency as 
compared to a baseline condition should be evaluated by the Investigator for clinical significance 
and adverse event reporting.  
Each adverse event in this study will be assessed for Grade, where Grade of an AE refers to the 
severity of the AE.   Grade will be assessed according to CTCAE Version 4.03 or higher.  The 
CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE 
that are based on this general guideline.   Table 6  provides the CTCAE grades and grade 
descriptions to be used in this study.  
Table  6: CTCAE Grade (Study AVE 901-102)  
CTCAE Grade  CTCAE Grade Description  
Grade 1: Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2: 
Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental ADL1. 
Grade 3: Severe Severe or medically significant but n ot immediately life- threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL2. 
Grade 4: Life -
threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5: Death  Death related to the AE . 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
1 Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
2 Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taki ng medications, and not 
bedridden.  
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), Version 4.03 will be used for AE 
grading.  A complete CTCAE list can be downloaded at http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html . 
12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during the stud y that fulfills one or more of the 
following:  
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life- threatening  
• It requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Protocol AVE -901-102 Phase 3  Orthopedic   Tramadol Infusion 
Avenue Therapeutics, Inc.   October 24, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  55  
   • It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient  or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
Reporting serious adverse events requires additional detailed reports and follow -up, depending 
upon the Investigator's estimate of a causal relationship between the test agent and the adverse 
event(s), and whether the adverse event(s) is identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the 
Investigator's Brochure or other risk information supplied to the Investigator.  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be submitte d promptly to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).  The investigator must make an effort to obtain 
all hospital medical records including discharge summary confirming final diagnosis.  The death 
of a patient  must be immedi ately (within 24 hours) reported to the IRB.  All serious and non-
serious adverse events should be thoroughly documented and followed out by the Investigator 
until the event resolves or until the termination visit.  The event may be followed longer, if 
deemed necessary.  For any death occurring during the trial, the medical condition that led to the 
death should also be noted.  The “outcome” status should be noted as “death” in these cases of 
SAEs that resulted in death.  In addition, all SAEs that occur wi thin 1 week following early 
termination visit should be recorded and reported as noted previously.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each A E.  The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her 
medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the 
investigational product.  For purposes of the definitions below, “temporal sequence” is defined 
as an association between administration of a drug and the observed reaction or event such that 
the drug was present prior to the reaction or event. 
DEFINITE -  The adverse event:  
• follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration,  
• abates upon discont inuation of the drug (dechallenge), AND  
• is confirmed by reappearance of the reaction on repeat exposure (rechallenge). 
PROBABLE - The adverse event:  
• follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration,  
• abates upon discontinuation of the drug (dechallenge), and  
• cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient ’s clinical 
state.  
POSSIBLE - The adverse event:  
• follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration, and;  
• could have been produced by the patient 's clinical state or by other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient . 
REMOTE  
Protocol AVE -901-102 Phase 3  Orthopedic   Tramadol Infusion 
Avenue Therapeutics, Inc.   October 24, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  56  
   • The temporal sequence between the adverse event and the drug administration is such 
that the drug is not likely to have had any reasonable association with the observed 
event. 
DEFINITELY NOT – The adverse event:  
• is definitely produced by the patient 's clinical state or by other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient . 
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the patient /caregiver  and/or in response to an open 
question from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at 
the investigational site.  The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible.  For each AE, the Investigator will ev aluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), severity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and 
whether or not it caused the patient  to discontinue the study.  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section 12.2.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity  
may not be considered serious.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on a pregnancy reporting form.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational 
product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the patient  was 
discontinued from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
12.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
Information about AEs and S AEs will be collected from treatment (i.e. from time of first dose ) 
through the follow -up phone call.  Events occurring prior to first dose of study treatment will  be 
recorded as medical history .  AEs or SAEs occurring after the first dose of study treatme nt wil l 
be treatment -emergent (S)AEs .  Any SAEs considered at least possibly related to the 
investigational product and discovered by the Investigator at any time after the study should be 
reported.  The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of 
the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents.  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be communicated within 
one business day of receipt and this should be com pleted on a follow -up SAE form and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the e CRF and/or 
study file.  
The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events.  It 
is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all SAEs that occur at his or her site.

   Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7/15 Day 
Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical trial.  Each site is respon sible for notifying its IRB 
or IEC of these additional SAEs.

   13. STATISTICS  
This i s a double -blind, 3- arm, placebo -controlled  treatment study to determine the efficacy and 
safety of tramadol infusion in patients undergoing bunionectomy.  T he statistical method s to be 
used in the analysis are consistent with both the study design and the study objectives.  
13.1. Sample Size Considerations  
A sample size of 135 patients per arm (405 patients in total) provides over 90% power to detect a 
SPID48 difference of 250 between treatment with placebo and treatment with AVE -901, 
assuming a common SPID48 standard deviation of 600 (and thus an approximat e 40% effect 
size), an alpha of 0.05 using a two- sided test of mean differences.   
13.2. General Statistical Methods  
Data will be tabulated (by treatment group) using descriptive and inferential statistics , where 
specified.  A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written and approved prior to 
unblinding .  This SAP will detail how missing values, windows for study visits, and other 
analysis considerations will be addressed.  
13.3. Analysis Populatio ns 
Populations identified for purposes of the statistical  analysis  are listed below . 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population is defined as all randomized patients who 
receive study medication.  Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment group 
they were randomized to.   
• The Safety Population is defined as all patients who receive study medication.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the actual treatment they receive.  
• The All Enrolled Population will include the F AS and subset of patients who are  
randomized but not treated due not meeting post -surgical dosing criteria.  The 
handling of these patients will be described  in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
13.4. Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics will be tabulated descriptively ( e.g., number a nd percent of patient s for 
each category for categorical parameters, and the number, mean, standard deviation, and range 
for continuous parameters).  Baseline comparability among the treatment groups with respect to 
demographic and other baseline character istics will be assessed for quantitative variables with a 
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment group and study center as main effects. 
For categorical variables, the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will be used, stratified by center.  
13.5. Patient  Disposition  
Patient disposition (including the number and percent of patients who are randomized, who 
receive randomized treatment, who prematurely discontinue and reasons for discontinuation, and 
who complete the study) will be tabulated by treatment group.   The number (%) of patients by 
exposure will be tabulated.

   13.6. Efficacy Analyses  
13.6.1. Primary Endpoint  
SPID48 (the sum of the time -weighted pain intensity differences for the time period 0 -48 hours) 
is the primary efficacy endpoint.   
13.6.2. Handling of Missing Efficacy Data  
For the primary causal estimate in this study (to reflect the true treatment effects of tramadol 
compared to placebo), missing values within a patient during the 48 -hour treatment period will 
be handled in the following manner:  
• When rescue medication is used, the last pain intensity measure prior to the use of 
rescue medication will be used (imputed) for the subsequent protocol -specified time 
points for measurement of pain intensity through 4 -hours after the time of the rescue 
medication.  
All other mis sing data will be imputed utilizing multiple imputation methods.  Multiple 
imputation provides a useful strategy for analyzing data sets with missing values. Instead of 
filling in a single value for each missing value, Rubin’s (1976,) multiple imputation s trategy 
replaces each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the 
correct value to impute.  
For patients with arbitrary missing data patterns (missing at random, MAR), a pattern -mixture 
approach will be taken to the  imputation.  The first step will be to apply a Markov chain Monte 
Carlo (MCMC) method (Schafer 1997) that assumes multivariate normality will be used to 
impute all missing values to make the imputed (resulting) data sets have strictly monotone 
missing pat terns.  The resulting monotone missing pattern will then, in a second imputation step, 
be used to impute the remaining missing values; specifically, a regression -based method for 
continuous variables will be applied.  
For patients with missing data as a res ult of discontinuation due to adverse (missing not at 
random, MNAR), the pattern- mixture approach will also be taken to the imputation (as for the 
monotone MAR data),with the difference that while a similar regression -based method for 
continuous variables will be applied, a scaled (constant) adjustment to the imputed values will be 
made such that the outcomes that are imputed are distributionally ‘worse’ than those imputed for 
the monotone MAR data.  This scaled adjustment will increase each imputed value ( from the 
regression) for these MNAR data by a constant of ‘1’, e.g. , if the regression provides an imputed 
value of 4.6 for a given missing value for a patient  at a given timepoint, the MNAR imputed 
value will be set to 4.6 + 1 = 5.6 for that patient  at th at time point.  This will, in effect, guarantee 
that the overall distribution of missing values for discontinuations due to adverse event is  
WORSE than th at for other reasons.  
The SAS software system will be used to perform this imputation.  Because the im putation of 
missing data is a key aspect to the analysis of pain data, explicit details regarding this imputation 
are provided via sample SAS code that is intended to demonstrate the application of these 
strategies.  Variable definitions are:  
• TRT=treatment  group (1 or 0) 
Protocol AVE -901-102 Phase 3  Orthopedic   Tramadol Infusion 
Avenue Therapeutics, Inc.   October 24, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  60  
   • Pain_1 is the first time point for the pain score  
• Pain_2 is the second time point for the pain score  
• Pain_last is the last time point for the pain score. Additional pain scores (between 
Pain_1 and Pain_last) would be included in this model according to the time points 
for collection.  
The first step will be to impute partially in order to obtain a monotone missing data pattern.  
proc mi data=DATAIN out=DATAIN_MONO nimpute=100 seed=123;  
var TRT Pain_1 Pain_2 …. Pain_last; 
mcmc chain=multiple impute=monotone;  
run;  
The second step will be to impute the remaining (monotone) missing data that is MAR for each 
of the 100 imputed datasets from the first step.  
proc mi data=DATAIN_MONO out=DATAIN_REG seed=465 nimpute=1;  
by _Imputation_;  
var TRT Pain_1 Pain_2 …. Pain_last;  
class TRT;  
monotone regression;  
run; 
In the case of missing data due to an adverse event, the following step will be used:  
proc mi data=DATAIN_MONO out=DATAIN_REG seed=465 nimpute=1;  
by _Imputation_;  
var TRT Pain_1 Pain_2 …. Pain_last;  
class TRT;  
monotone regression (pain1 pain2 … Pain_last);  
mnar adjust (pain1 pain2 … Pain_last / shift=1);  
run; 
Note that the regressions do not include the treatment variable, and thus the imputed data at each 
time point w ill be based on the distribution of all data rather than treatment -group specific 
distributions.  A total of 100 imputed datasets will be created using these imputed data and 
analyzed according to the primary method of statistical analysis.  
13.6.3. Primary Method of Statistical Analysis  
Each of the 100 imputed datasets will be analyzed as follows:   
• An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to test the primary efficacy 
endpoint.  The model will use treatment and study center as main effects, and baseline 
pain intensity ( NPRS scale 0 to 10) as the covariate.  Data from all three treatment 
groups will be included in the same ANCOVA model for purposes of the testing 
procedures.  
The 100 resulting treatment effect parameters and standard errors from th ese ANCOVA will be 
combined to provide a distribution of parameters (and standard errors) upon which the primary 
hypothesis of treatment effect will be determined.  
13.6.4. Key Secondary Endpoints  
The key secondary endpoints will be assessed as follows:  
Protocol AVE -901-102 Phase 3  Orthopedic   Tramadol Infusion 
Avenue Therapeutics, Inc.   October 24, 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  61  
   • 24-hour pai n intensity (SPID24) will be assessed in a similar manner as the primary 
endpoint.  
• Total consumption of rescue analgesia will be analyzed nonparametrically using the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test.   
• Patient Global Assessment at scheduled evaluations will be assessed for treatment 
group differences using an ANCOVA comparison with center and the baseline pain 
score as the stratification factor.  
13.6.5. Tertiary endpoints  
Tertiary endpoints will be assessed as follows:  
• Time- specific pain intensity profile over time will be assessed using a mixed models 
repeated measures (MMRM), with fixed effects for treatment, time, the treatment by 
time interaction, and random patient  effect.  Pairwise comparisons at each time point 
will be determined from the MMRM, and model -based means ( LSMeans) and 
standard errors will be plotted for visual comparison of the treatment group outcomes. 
• The time to pain relief (meaningful and perceptib le), as well as time to first rescue 
medication , will be assessed using a log -rank statistic, stratified by  center.  A Kaplan -
Meier plot will be provided for each of these outcomes.  The time to event analyses 
will include the times to events of death or withdrawal from study as endpoints.  
Patient s will be censored at 4 hours for time to pain relief, while tim e to first rescue  
medication  will be censored at 48 hours.   
• The number (%) of patients who require no rescue analgesia during the 48- hour 
period following T0 will be assessed using a CMH test stratified by center.  
• The rate of consumption of rescue analges ia will be analyzed nonparametrically using 
the Wilcoxon rank sum test.   
13.7. Alpha Levels  
There are 2 pairwise comparisons of interest:  
• High -dose tramadol (50 mg) vs placebo 
• Low-dose tramadol (25 mg) vs placebo 
All inferential assessments will be 2 -sided test s performed at the 0.05 alpha level.  A hierarchical 
alpha testing strategy will be utilized to control for the overall experiment -wise alpha.  As there 
are multiple tests being performed (the single primary efficacy variable pairwise test and the 2 
key se condary efficacy tests), the following strategy will be applied:   
The high -dose tramadol arm vs placebo comparison will be assessed for the primary endpoint at 
the 0.05 alpha level.  If and only if the p-value is ≤ 0.05 for this pairwise comparison will t he 
lower dose tramadol arm vs placebo comparison be assessed.  If the p -value for the high -dose 
arm is NOT significant, all testing will cease and it will be concluded that neither tramadol 
treatment arm provides better pain relief than placebo.

CONFIDENTIAL  62  
   If the pri mary endpoint is significant for the AVE -901 vs. placebo comparison (in favor of the 
tramadol arm) for one or both pair- wise tests, then statistical testing will proceed to the 
secondary endpoints within each pair -wise grouping, to be tested in the followi ng order:  
• SPID24  
• Total consumption of rescue analgesia  
• Patient Global Assessment of efficacy at 24 and 48 hours (the two time points will be 
tested simultaneously)  
If a statistical test within each pairwise comparison is significant at the nominal 0.05 lev el, two -
sided (in favor of the tramadol arm), then testing will proceed to the next endpoint in the list.  
Once a non- significant test occurs, endpoints lower in the list are considered not statistically 
significant.  
Note that while inferential comparison of the high dose to the low dose is not a key aspect of the 
statistical analysis, assessment of the dose -response will be performed across the 3 doses in order 
to allow visual comparison of the outcomes for the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
13.8. Subgroups  
Analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints, as well as treatment -emergent AE and 
serious AE incidence, will be provided by the following subgroups:  
• Gender  
• Race  
• Age (using the study median age)  
• Investigational center  
13.9. Safety  
The safety analysis will be descriptive in nature.  All safety data will be listed, and data will be 
tabulated  by treatment group  where the data warrant.   Safety data include:  
• AEs, including assessment of infusion site local reactions (skin and vein)  
• Clinical laboratory  tests (hematology panel, chemistry panel and urinalysis) pre -
treatment and discharge 
• Vital signs including: respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure, a s per the 
schedule of events   
• Physical examination pre- treatment and discharge 
• 12-lead ECG at pr otocol specified timepoints  
• Concomitant treatments  
Exploratory analyses of use of anti -emetics may be performed.  Exploratory analyses of use of 
anti-emetics may be performed.  Other safety data presentations will be descriptive in nature and 
no formal sta tistical tests will be performed.

   ECG results will be analyzed on an ongoing basis by a central ECG reader on an individual 
patient level and as well as by group analysis.  
13.9.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary; pat ient incidence of each 
system organ class and unique term will be tabulated.  AE incidence will also be tabulated 
according to relationship to study medication and severity.  Serious AEs and AEs resulting in 
premature discontinuation will be tabulated.   
Adverse events starting  before  the first dose of treatment will be reported as Medical History   
Adverse events starting  after the first dose of treatment will be considered treatment -emerg ent 
adverse events.  
Local tolerability at  the infusion site will be assessed for pain, swelling, tenderness, and 
erythema.  
13.9.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be reviewed and coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary, 
and tabulated by treatment.  
13.9.3. Clinical Laboratories  
Clinical laboratory obse rved values and changes from pre -treatment to on -treatment time points 
may be tabulated for continuous parameters, as warranted.   
13.9.4. Vital Signs  
Vital sign parameter outcomes (including SpO2) will be assessed for clinical significance; 
observed values and changes from pre -treatment to on -treatment time points may be tabulated 
for continuous parameters, as warranted.

   14. STUDY MONITORING, AU DITS, IRB, AND QUALI TY 
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a patient  into the study, a Sponsor representative will 
visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives.  This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor (or its delegate) 
and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor or Sponsor representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the e CRF, and that investigational product accountability checks 
are being performed  
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison o f the data in the e CRF 
with the patient ’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to 
the study.  This will require direct access to all original (or faxed/copied, if requested) 
records for each patient  (e.g. clinic charts) w hich may include access to medical records 
for purposes of remote (i.e. not on- site at the Investigator’s clinic) source data 
verification  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor (or its 
delegate)  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on e CRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Sponsor (or its delegate) and those SAEs that met criteria 
for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB . 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) o r other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, its delegate, a regulatory authority, an Independent 
Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or 
inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of an audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, anal yzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The

Aptinyx Confidential  6 Methodology:  
Study Design  
The study will be a 6 - to 9-week study, including a 1-to 4-week Screening Period, followed by a 
4-week double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled Treatment Period , and a 1 -week Follow Up 
Period.  
 
Screening Period  (Week -4 to -1) 
The subject s will be asked to provide informed consent for this study before any required procedures 
are performed. Subjects will also be required  to sign an additional consent for their inclusion in a 
subject registry data base. The database will use partially -identified subject information to review 
subjects’ research study history within a proprietary, secure platform . Subjects who meet any of the 
following criteria will not be eligible for continued screening: current enr ollment in another study, 
concurrent screening at another research site, violation  of the required number of half -lives since the 
last research study, violation of the washout period between studies, or incorrect age for the NYX -
2925 -2001 study. Employees,  contractors and volunteers of the study site, or relatives of any 
employees, contractors and volunteers of the study site are not eligible to participate.  
 
Subjects with Type 2 diabetes who have been on stable antidiabetic medication for at least 1 month (or 
have stable glycemic control with diet and exercise alone) and who have been suffering from painful 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the lower extremities for at least 6 months but not more than 10 years 
will be screened for diabetic peripheral neurop athy using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening 
Instrument and the Masquerading Disorders Tool. Subjects must have a score of ≥4 and ≤9 on the 11 -
point Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) for average pain over the past 24 hours at Visit 1 . Subjects will be 
assessed for widespread pain symptoms using the American College of Rheumatology  Fibromyalgia 
Criteria. Additional procedures during Visit 1 will in clude the administration of the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale ( HADS ), completion of the Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S-STS), adverse 
event collection which will begin at the time of informed consent, demographic characteristics, medical 
history including concomitant medications, complete physical examination (with c omprehensive 
neurological examination), 5 -minute electrocardiogram, vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse), 
height, body weight, and collection of blood and urine samples for chemistry,  Human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, triglycerides, hematology  (including HbA1c) , and urinalysis. 
All subjects will undergo urine drug and alcohol screen using a local urine testing kit and breathalyzer, 
respectively. Subjects who test positive for marijuana, opioids, benzodiazepines inconsistent with 
curre nt prescriptions, or alcohol will not be allowed to continue in the study. Female subjects of 
childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local urine testing kit  and will be counseled 
to begin or continue using highly effective contraceptio n.  
 
Eligible subjects who meet all entry criteria will enter a 1 - to 4-week Screening Period, during which 
they will discontinue all except 1 (if applicable) of their pharmacologic analgesic treatments for 
neuropathic pain associated with diabetic periphe ral neuropathy, and complete daily pain diaries. The 
duration of the Screening Period will depend upon the analgesic treatment that is being discontinued. 
The only allowed analgesic s for painful diabetic peripheral neu ropathy may not be  an N-methyl -D-
aspar tate receptor  ligand, must be non-opioid and non -sedative , and must not interfere with subjects’ 
pain reporting. The allowed analgesic  must have been taken for at least 1  month (30 days) prior to Visit 
1, and subjects must be on a stable fixed dose that is  not expected to change during the study.  Subjects 
already taking no more than 1  allowed concomitant analgesic medication at Visit 1 may directly begin 
Week -1 of the Screening Period.

Aptinyx Confidential  7 During Visit 1, eligible subjects will be provided a handheld device,  and as a method for ensuring 
consistency and reliability of pain scoring, subjects will be instructed at Visits 1 through 3 on how to 
record their pain on the device. Subjects will also be educated at Visits 1 through 3 on appropriate 
expectations around their participation in a clinical study and the importance of consistently  and 
accurately reporting their pain throughout the study.  Review of these  educational materials may be 
repeated for some or all subjects depending  on findings of an ongoing blinded data review (e.g., if pain 
score variability is increased on a subject or site level).  
 
Subjects will be dispensed acetaminophen to be used as rescue medication, and will be instructed to 
take no more than 2 g/daily (one to two 500 -mg caplets every 4 to 6 hours as needed) for DPN pain.  
 
Beginning immediately after Visit 1, pain intensity and rescue medication use will be recorded in the 
study -issued handheld device daily at bedtime. Subjects will enter their average pain i ntensity, worst 
pain intensity, pain on walking, and whether  rescue medication was used during the past 24 hours. Pain 
intensity will be recorded using an 11 -point (NRS ), with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain 
imaginable. Every morning upon awake ning, subjects will complete the Daily Sleep Interference Scale 
(DSIS ) via their study -issued handheld device.  
 
Screening Period (Week -1) 
The investigative site staff will contact  study subjects by telephone weekly through Week -1 to 
reinforce the reporting instructions  (i.e., diary completion) and to assess adverse events. Subjects will 
be asked a non -leading question to inquire about potential adverse events, “Have you experienced any 
new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since last week?”  Subjects taking no more than 1 
allowed concomitant analgesic medication s at Visit 1 may directly begin Week -1 of the Screening 
Period.  
 
Baseline Visit (Week 0)  
At Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), study personnel will verify eligibility with the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria when the subjects are on site, and prior to randomization. P ain scores reported by subjects 
during the Screening Period will be evaluated by the interactive response technolo gy system for raw 
score and for variability among scores after transmission of pain scores from the handheld devices  to 
determine randomization eligibility The interactive response technology system will notify the site if 
the subjects is “Eligible” or “No t eligible .” No other information will be provided.  
 
Subjects whose mean of the daily average pain intensity score during the preceding 7 (±1) days is 
within the protocol -defined algorithm and with adequate  compliance with daily diary completion will 
be el igible for randomization. The absolute pain score and variability among scores, as well as the 
actual percentage required for diary compliance will be masked to investigators and subjects. Subject 
eligibility for randomization into the study based on these  variables will be communicated to the 
investigator via the interactive response technology system.  
 
Subjects will again be asked a non -leading question to assess potential a dverse events .  Use of 
concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs (bl ood pressure and pulse) will be measured 
after sitting for 5 minutes and a 5 -minute electrocardiogram will be performed. Medical history will be 
updated and a brief physical examination performed. Blood and urine samples will be collected for 
chemistry, he matology, and urinalysis testing. Subjects will undergo drug and alcohol screen using a 
local urine testing kit and breathalyzer, respectively. Subjects who test positive for marijuana, opioids,

Aptinyx Confidential  8 benzodiazepines  inconsistent  with current prescriptions , or a lcohol , will not be allowed to continue in 
the study.  Female subjects of childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local urine 
testing kit and will be counseled to continue using highly effective contraception.  
 
Eligible subjects will be  random ized to receive either NYX -2925  or placebo for 4 weeks. Investigators 
and subjects will be masked to the randomization allocation.  
 
Subjects will be dispensed a 2 -week supply of investigational product and instructed to take 2 capsules 
by mouth once  daily. Subjects will also be re -dispensed acetaminophen to use as rescue medication  for 
DPN pain ; instructions not to exceed 2 g/day will be reinforced. The appropriate use of rescue 
medication will be assessed by inventory of the returned caplets, as wel l as by subject interview.  
 
Subjects will be instructed to continue entering their average pain intensity, worst pain intensity, pain 
upon walking, and  whether they used  rescue medication over the past 24 hours into their study -issued 
handheld devices ever y night. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will complete the DSIS via 
their study -issued handheld device. Pain diary compliance will be reviewed at each study visit by the 
study staff, and reporting instructions will be reinforced.  
 
Quantitative senso ry testing will be done using the Bedside Sensory Testing Kit. The following scales 
will be completed at the Baseline Visit: Brief Pain Inventory for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy 
(BPI -DPN), the Short -Form McGill Pain Questionnaire version 2  (SF-MPQ -2), the Norfolk Quality of 
Life Questionnaire - Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL -DN), the HADS, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the 
S-STS.   
 
One week following the Week 0 visit, subjects will be contacted by telephone for an assessment of 
adverse events and to reinforce diary completion. Adverse events will be assessed by asking the subject 
a non -leading question.  
 
Treatment Period: Week 2  
Subjects will return to the clinic at the end of Week 2 for assessment of compliance with study 
medication, use of re scue medication, and be dispensed the final 2 -week supply of investigational 
product and rescue medication  for DPN pain . Pain diary compliance will be reviewed by the study 
staff, and reporting instructions will be reinforced. Adverse events will be assess ed by asking the 
subject a non -leading question. Use of concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs 
(sitting blood pressure and pulse) will be measured. Blood samples will be collected for liver function 
testing. Female subjects of childbearing  potential will be counseled to continue using highly effective 
contraception. Subjects will be instructed to continue entering their average pain intensity, worst pain 
intensity, pain upon walking, and rescue medication use over the past 24  hours into the ir study -issued 
handheld devices every night. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will complete the DSIS via 
their study -issued handheld device.  
 
Scales to be completed at the Week 2 visit include the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C), 
the S -STS,  and the Insomnia Severity Index.   
 
One week following the Week 2 visit, subjects will be contacted by telephone for an assessment of 
adverse events and to reinforce diary completion.

Treatment Period: Week 4/Early  Termination  
During the Week 4 or Ear ly Termination Visit, subjects will be evaluated for compliance with study 
medication, and return all materials and unused study medication/rescue medication to the study site. 
The study -issued handheld device will be returned. Pain diary compliance will b e reviewed by the 
study staff. Adverse events will be assessed  by asking the subject a non -leading question. Use of 
concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse) and body 
weight will be measured, brief physical examination performed, and subjects will undergo a 5 -minute 
electrocardiogram. Blood and urine samples will be collected for chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
testing. Female subjects of childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local  urine 
testing kit. Subjects will undergo drug and alcohol screen using a local urine testing kit and 
breathalyzer, respectively.  
 
Scales to be completed at the Week 4/Early Termination V isit include BPI -DPN, PGI -C, SF -MPQ -2, 
HADS, QOL -DN, Insomnia Severity Index, and S -STS.  
 
7 Days Post -Treatment  Follow Up  Visit (Week 5)  
Subjects will return to the study site 7 days following the Week 4/Early Termination visit to assess 
adverse events and concomitant medication use. The adverse event assessment will  include any serious 
adverse events that were ongoing at the time of study completion, and whether any ongoing adverse 
events had progressed to becoming serious.  Blood samples will be collected for liver function testing.  
 
Number of subjects (planned and  analyzed):  
Approximately 300 subjects enrolled by a randomized method with a pre -specified number of  subjects

Aptinyx Confidential  14 Sample Size:  
The planned sample size is a total of 300 randomized subjects.  This sample size will provide 
approximately 80 % power for a 2 -sided t -test with Type I error of 0.048.  
Statistical methods:  
Safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population, which is defined as all subjects who receive at 
least 1 dose of investigational product. Efficacy analyses will be based on the modified I ntent -to-Treat 
Population, which is defined as all subjects in the Safety Population with at least 1 post baseline 
assessment of the pain intensity NRS.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the daily pain intensity NRS score from the handheld device will be 
averaged for baseline (Days -7 to -1) and Week 4 (Days 22 to 28) after randomization. Change from 
baseline to Week 4 will be assessed for treatment group differences with an analysis of covariance with 
fixed factors for study site and treatment, with basel ine value as a covariate.  As a sensitivity analysis, a  
mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to assess treatment differences. The 
model will include factors for study site, treatment, week, and the treatment -by-week interaction, w ith 
baseline value as a covariate.  
Change in the mean NRS score assessing average pain intensity in the past 24 hours from baseline 
(average of Days -7 to -1) to each week of treatment will be assessed for treatment group differences

Aptinyx Confidential  21 4 INTRODUCTION 
NYX-2925 is a novel small molecule being developed for the treatment of neuropathic pain and 
fibromyalgia. NYX-2925 is an N- methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) functional glycine-site 
partial agonist, and at low concentrations of endogenous agonist (glycine or D-serine), 
NYX-2925 partially activates NMDAR. NYX-2925 appears to act at a binding site that is 
distinct from NMDAR agonists or antagonists studied to date, such as D-cycloserine, ketamine, 
MK-801, or kynurenic acid. The NYX-2925 mode of action is distinct from that of all of existing 
and emerging drugs that are indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. 
While current medications target individual elements of pain signal transmission or modulation, 
NYX-2925 modulates multiple synaptic relays within pain circuits. 
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and acts 
through activation of glutamate recep
tors. A portion of the receptors bind preferentially to 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and are therefore, termed NMDARs . Unlike other glutamate 
receptor
s found in the brain, such as α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid or 
kai
nic acid receptors, the NMDARs ar
e unique in that they have distinct binding sites for both 
glutamate and glycine, and binding by both ligands is required for receptor activation. The 
NMDARs are implicated in a number of physiologica
l and pathological processes, including 
anxiety, cognition, learning, stroke, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain 
(Traynelis 2010, Mony 2009, Tai 2001).  
The central ner
vous system modulates the experience of pain in people with neuropathic pain, 
with the rostroventralmedial medulla ( Silva 2016 ), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
(Russo 2015), the insula and other brain regions ( Ossipov  2010) all thought to be involved. 
Neuropathic pain is caused by disease or in
jury of the somatosensory system as opposed to 
nociceptive pain where the sensory system is physiologically normal ( Jensen 2014). While 
neuropathic pain can initially arise within the central or the peripheral nervous system through a 
wide r
ange of etiologies, central nervous system modulation 
of the experience of pain is 
common, regardless of the specific precipit
ating factors or initial location of the pain. The 
prevalence of neuropathic pain is approximately 8% in the population in the United States 
(Gilron 2015, Toth 2013, Bouhassira 2008 ). 
Individuals suffering from  neuropathic pain, 
irrespective of the underlying disorder, currently have limited treatment options available. 
Current treatment options predominantly include antidepressants and antiepileptics. These 
therapies have shown some efficacy in treating neuropathic pain symptoms, although for a large 
proportion of patients, treatment is insuffic
ient. 
Preclinical pharmacology studies support the study of NYX-2925 in both fibromyalgia and 
neuropathic pain, both of which are chronic pain syndromes involving central nervous system 
modulation of pain signals. NYX-2925 is effective in several models of neuropathic pain, and 
has been shown to be effective in the chronic unpredictable stress model of fibromyalgia. Animal 
models of neuropathic pain in which NYX-2925 was tested include the rat Bennett model of 
neuropathic pain, the rat 
streptozotocin model of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and the rat 
Taxol® model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Unlike gabapentin (150 mg/kg orally), 
NYX-2925 (1 to 30 mg/kg orally) produced a rapid and long-lasting analgesia in the rat Bennett 
model of neuropathic pain without changes in locomotor activity after a single dose. Further, in 
Clinical Protocol Masked NYX -2925-2001  Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018 
Aptinyx Confidential  22 the chronic unpredictable stress model of fibromyalgia, NYX-2925 (10 mg/kg) has been shown 
to produce mechanical analgesia. In summary, these data support testing NYX-2925 in both 
fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain. 
Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in rats and dogs, and suggest that NYX-2925 is 
rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, and time to peak plasma concentration is reached within 
1 hour. NYX-2925 is rapidly eliminated from plasma with an apparent terminal elimination 
hal
f-life in the range of 1 to 2 hours. Brain exposure is approximately 5% to 10% relative to 
plasma levels of NYX-2925. 
Both si
ngle-dose and daily repeat-dose toxicology studies have been performed in rats and dogs. 
The maximum tolerated dose following a single oral exposure is at least 1000 mg/kg in both rats 
and dogs. After 6 weeks of daily oral doses, the no-observed-adverse-effect levels were the 
highest doses tested (180 mg/kg in dogs and 480 mg/kg in rats). There were no adverse findings 
in either species. The plasma levels (exposure) of NYX-2925 at the highest doses in these studies 
are considered to be at least 50- to 100-fold the projected human therapeutic dose.   
NYX-2925 has been administered to humans. The first- in-human study (NYX-2925-1001), for 
which r
esults are available, was a combined single and multiple ascending dose, placebo-
cont
rolled study in healthy volunteers that also includes food-effect, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 
and el
derly cohorts.  
In the single dose portion of the study, single doses of NYX-2925 were administered orally. Five 
ascending dose groups (50 mg, 150 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg) and an elderly cohort 
(300 mg) with 8 subjects each (6 on active drug, 2 on placebo in each group) were dosed. Seven 
days a
fter the initial dose, the 400 mg dose group received a second repeated dose (6 active drug, 
1 placebo) to examine the effect of food on plasma drug concentrations. A CSF cohort (50 mg) 
was also completed with 6 subjects receiving NYX-2925. In 7 dose groups or cohorts, 29 males 
and 
25 females were enrolled. A total of 52 of the 54 single dose subjects completed the study. 
Two 
subjects randomized to placebo discontinued study participation. One subject was lost to 
follow-up and 1 subject discontinued due to physician decision (related to subject 
noncompliance). One subject in the elderly cohort receiving 300 mg experienced a treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE) which was not considered related to NYX-2925. Five subjects 
in t
he CSF cohort receiving 50 mg experienced at least one TEAE, one of which (procedural 
headache) was deemed related to NYX-2925. One subject receiving placebo experienced a 
TEA
E. There were no TEAEs reported for clinical laboratories, safety electrocardiograms, or 
vit
al signs.     
In t
he multiple ascending dose phase, there were three ascending dose groups (150, 600 and 900 
mg) with 8 subjects in each dose group; 6 received active drug and 2 received placebo for up to 7 
days
. There were also 6 subjects in the CSF cohort who were dosed with NYX-2925 300 mg (no 
pla
cebo control) and 5 completed the study. A total of 15 males and 15 females were enrolled. 
Study medication was given once daily for up to 7 days. Two subjects in the CSF cohort 
discontinued study participation, 1 due to other  (related to subject noncompliance) and 1 due to 
protocol violation. All subjects in 150 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg dose groups received all 7 doses 
of study medication. Twelve subjects (1 NYX-2925 150 mg, 3 NYX-2925 600 mg, 1 NYX-2925 
900 mg, 2 placebo, and 5 NYX-2925 300 mg CSF cohort) reported at least 1 TEAE. There was 
one subject in the 150 mg dose group with urinary retention assessed as unrelated by the 
investigator, and possibly related by the sponsor. There was 1 subject with at least 1 study drug 
Clinical Protocol Masked NYX -2925-2001  Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018 
Aptinyx Confidential  23 related TEAE (flatulence and bloating) in the 600 mg dose group, 1 placebo subject with at least 
1 study drug related TEAE (fatigue and lethargy), and 1 CSF cohort subject with at least 1 study 
drug r
elated TEAE (headache). No grade 3 or higher TEAEs, serious TEAEs, or TEAEs leading 
to st
udy discontinuation were reported. No individual preferred adverse event term was reported 
for more than 1 subject in the 150 mg, 600 mg, or 900 mg dose groups. In the CSF cohort, 3 
subjects reported procedural headache, 5 subjects reported procedural pain, and 2 subjects 
re
ported vomiting. There were no TEAEs reported for clinical laboratories, safety 
electrocardiograms, or vital signs. 
Concerning cardiovascular safety, a thorough analysis of ECGs demonstrated that NYX-2925 
did not increase QTc at any dose up to 1200 mg.  The maximum geometric mean peak plasma 
concentration (C max) (20.1 μg/ml) was well above the expected exposure in clinical care.  There 
were no clinically significant changes in HR, PR and QRS or in ECG diagnostic statements. 
The pharmacokinetics of NYX-2925 in humans are similar to the pharmacokinetics in rats and 
dogs.
 Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that absorption of NYX-2925 was relatively rapid and 
peak conc
entrations were achieved within 2 hours after dosing and declined in a roughly 
monophasic manner over 24 hours. The pharmacokinetics were dose proportional over the dose 
range tested (within the variability) and showed minimal accumulation following once per day 
dosing for 7 days. A high-fat, high-caloric meal decreased the rate of absorption (delayed T max), 
lowered C max by 10%, but had no impact on the extent of exposure (area under the plasma 
conce
ntration versus time curve [AUC] values were comparable), suggesting that the compound 
m
ay be administered with or without food. The majority, approximately 60% to 70%, of the 
administered dose was eliminated as unchanged NYX-2925 in the urine. The central nervous 
syst
em exposure was confirmed from the CSF concentration time profile in both CSF dose 
groups. The CSF concentrations increased proportionally as the dose increased. 
In summary, NYX-2925 has been sufficiently tested in preclinical studies for safety and 
tolerability over a wide dose range, wi th exposures greater than the proposed clinical doses. 
General toxicology studies support clinical studies up to and including 6 weeks of daily doses. 
Results from the first- in-human study indicate that NYX-2925 is  safe and well-tolerated in the 
m
ale and female healthy volunteers dosed to date at single doses up to 1200 mg, and multiple 
doses up to 900 mg given daily for 7 days. The preclinical and phase 1 clinical data support 
further
 testing in humans. 
In addition to the current trial, there are 2 other ongoing clinical studies with NYX-2925. NYX-
2925-1003 is a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot, crossover study to assess the 
eff
ects of NYX-2925 on sleep architecture as assessed by polysomnography in healthy male 
subjects aged 40-55 when their bedtime is advanced by 3 hours in a sleep laboratory. Also 
ongoing is study NYX-2925-2002, in subjects with fibromyalgia. The primary objective of this 
study is to determine whether NYX-2925 modulates central nervous system activity in key pain 
neural circuitry, consistent with the potential to provide analgesia in subjects with fibromyalgia, 
as assessed by neuroimaging methods. Secondarily, this study will provide a preliminary 
characterization of the safety of NYX-2925 in subjects with fibromyalgia. 
Further, there is planned study ; a phase 1, double-blind, randomized, sponsor-open, parallel, 
placebo-controlled exploratory study to assess the effect of multiple dose levels of NYX-2925 on 
Clinical Protocol Masked NYX -2925-2001  Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018 
Aptinyx Confidential  24 the brain function of healthy volunteers as measured by electroencephalogram and event related 
potentials.  
To date, one seri
ous adverse event, cholelithiasis requiring inpatient hospitalization, has been 
re
ported in the clinical development program for NYX -2925, that being in the current study, 
NYX-2925-2001. The event is considered not related to NYX-2925. 
 
This study (NYX-2925-2001) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple -dose 
study to assess the efficacy and safety of NYX-2925 in subjects with neuropathic pain associated 
with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. NYX-2925 will be provided as capsules for oral 
administration.

Aptinyx Confidential  27 6 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
The study will be a 6- to 9-week study, including a 1- to 4-week Screening Period, followed by a 
4-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Treatment Period, and a 1-week 
Foll
ow-
Up Period ( Figure 1).  The schedule of assessments is provided in Table  3. The study will 
include approximately 35 study sites in the United States. 
Screening Period (Week  -4 to -1 ) 
Upon Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the protocol, subjects will be asked to 
provide informed consent for this study before any required procedures are performed. Subjects 
will also be required to sign an additional consent for their inclusion in a subject registry 
database. The database will use partially-identified subject information to review subjects’ 
research study history within a proprietary, secure platform. Subjects who meet any of the 
following criteria will not be eligible for continued screening: current enrollment in another 
study, concurr
ent screening at another research site, violation of the required number of 
half-
lives since the last research study, violation of the washout period between studies, or 
incorrect
 age for the NYX-2925-2001 study. Employees, contractors and volunteers of the study 
site, or r
elatives of any employees, contractors and volunteers of the study site are not eligible for 
study partici
pation. 
Subjects with Type 2 diabetes who have been on stable antidiabetic medication for at least 
1 month (or have stable glycemic control with diet and exercise alone) and who have been 
suffering from painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the lower extremities for at least 6 
months but not more than 10 years will be screened for diabetic peripheral neuropathy using the 
Michig
an Neuropathy Screening Instrument and the Masquerading Disorders Tool. Subjects 
must have a score of ≥4 and ≤9 on the 11-point NRS for average pain over the past 24 hours at 
Visit 1. S
ubjects will be assessed for widespread pain symptoms using the American College of 
Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Criteria. Additional procedures during Visit 1 will include the 
administration of the HADS , completion of the S- STS, adver se event collection which will begin 
at the time of informed consent, demographic characteristics, medical history including 
concomitant
 medications, complete physical examination (with comprehensive neurological 
examinati
on), 5-minute electrocardiogram, vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse after 5 
minut
es), height, body weight, and collection of blood and urine samples for chemistry, HIV, 
hepat
itis, an
d triglycerides, hematology (including HbA1c), and urinalysis. All subjects will 
undergo urine drug and 
alcohol screen using a local urine testing kit and breathalyzer, 
respectively . Subjects who test positive for marijuana, opioids, benzodiazepines inconsistent 
with current prescriptions, 
or alcohol will not be allowed to continue in the study. Female 
subjects of
 childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local urine testing kit and 
will be counseled to begin or continu
e using highly effective contraception.  
Eligible
 subjects who meet all entry criteria will enter a 1- to 4-week Screening Period, during 
which t
hey 
will discontinue all except 1(if applicable) of their pharmacologic analgesic 
treatments for neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and complete 
daily pain diaries. The duration of the Screening Period will depend upon the analgesic treatment 
Clinical Protocol Masked NYX -2925-2001  Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018 
Aptinyx Confidential  28 that is being discontinued. The only allowed analgesic for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
may not be an N-methyl- D-aspartate receptor ligands, must be non-opioid and non-sedative, and 
must not interfere with subjects’ pain reporting ( Sect ion 8.7 ). The allowed analgesics must have 
been taken 
for at least 1 month (30 days) prior to Visit 1, and subjects must be on a stable fixed 
dose 
that is not expected to change during the study.  
The discontinuation of all (but 1 allowed, as applicable) analgesic medications will be managed 
by the pr
incipal investigator at the investigative site. Subjects already taking no more than 
1 allowed concomitant analgesic medication at Visit 1 may directly begin Week -1 of the 
Scre
ening P
eriod. 
During Visit 1, eligible subjects will be provided a handheld device, and as a method for 
ensuring consistency and reliability of pain scoring, and subjects will be instructed at Visits 1 
through 3 on how to record their pain on the device  
 Subjects
 will also be educated at Visits 1 through 3 on appropriate 
expectations around their participation in a clinical study  
, and the
 importance of consistently and accurately reporting 
their pain throughout the study. Review of these educational materials may be repeated for some 
or a
ll subjects depending on findings of an ongoing blinded data review (e.g., if pain score 
variability is increased on a subject or site level). 
Subjects will be dispensed acetaminophen to be used as rescue medication, and will be instructed 
to take no more than 2 g/daily (one to two 500-mg caplets every 4 to 6 hours as needed) for DPN 
pain. 
Beginni
ng immediately after Visit 1, pain intensity and rescue medication use will be recorded in 
the study-
issued handheld device daily at bedtime. Subjects will enter their average pain 
intensity, worst
 pain intensity, pain on walking, and whether rescue medication was used during 
the past 24 hours. Pain intensity will be recorded using an 11-point NRS , with 0 being no pain 
and 10
 being the worst pain imaginable. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will complete 
the
 DS
IS via their study-issued handheld device.  
 
Screening Period (Week - 1) 
The investigative site staff will contact study subjects by telephone weekly through Week -1 to 
reinforce the reporting instructions (i.e., diary completion) and to assess adverse events. Subjects 
will be asked a non-leading question to inquire about potential adverse events, “Have you 
experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since last week?” Subjects taking 
no more than 1 allowed concomitant analgesic medication at Visit 1 may directly begin Week -1 
of the
 Screening Period.

Aptinyx Confidential  29 Baseline (Week 0, Visit 2) 
At Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), study personnel will verify eligibility with the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria when the subjects are on site, and prior to randomization. Pain scores reported 
by subjects during the Screening Period will be evaluated by the interactive response technology 
system
 for raw score and for variability among scores after transmission of pain scores from the 
handheld de
vices to determine eligibility. The interactive response technology system will notify 
the site i
f the subject is “Eligible” or “Not eligible”. No other information will be provided. 
Subjec
ts whose mean of the daily average pain intensity score during the preceding 7 (±1) days 
is within the protocol-defined algorithm ( Section 12.2) and with adequate compliance with daily 
diary completion will be eligible for randomization. The absolute pain score and variability 
among scores, as well as the actual percentage required for diary compliance, will be masked to 
inve
stigators and subjects. The appropriate use of rescue medication will be assessed by 
invento
ry of the returned caplets, as well as by subject interview. Subject eligibility for 
random
ization into the study based on these variables will be communicated to the investigator 
via the interactive response technology system. 
Subjects will again be asked a non-leading question to assess potential adverse events, for 
example, “Have you experienced any new or changes symptoms since we last asked/since your 
last visit?” Use of concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs (blood pressure and 
pulse
) will be measured after sitting for 5 minutes and a 5-minute electrocardiogram will be 
performed. Medical history will be updated and a brief physical examination performed. Blood 
and urine
 samples will be collected for chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing. Subjects 
will
 undergo drug and alcohol screen using a local urine testing kit and breathalyzer, 
respectively. Subjects who test positive for marijuana, opioids, benzodiazepines inconsistent 
with current prescription
s, or alcohol, wi ll  not be allowed to continue in the study. Female 
subjects of
 childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local urine testing kit and 
will be counseled to continue using highly effective contraception.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either NYX-2925 or placebo for 4 weeks. 
Inve
stigators and subjects will be masked to the randomization allocation. 
Subjects will be dispensed a 2-week supply of investigational product and instructed to take 
2 capsules by mouth once daily. Subjects will also be re-dispensed acetaminophen to use as 
re
scue medication for DPN pain; instructions not to exceed 2 g/day will be reinforced.  
Subjec
ts will be instructed to continue entering their average pain intensity, worst pain intensity, 
pain upon walking, and whether they used rescue medication over the past 24 hours into their 
study-issued handheld devices every night. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will 
complete the DSIS via their study-issued handheld device. Pain diary compliance will be 
revie
wed at each study visit by the study staff, and reporting instructions will be reinforced. 
Quantitative sensory testing will be done using the Bedside Sensory Testing Kit. The following 
scales will be completed at the Baseline Visit: BPI-DPN, the SF-MPQ-2, the QOL-DN, the 
HADS, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the S-STS.  
One week fo
llowing the Week 0 visit, subjects will be contacted by telephone for an assessment 
of adverse events and to reinforce diary completion. Adverse events will be assessed  by asking 
the
 subject a non-leading question.

Aptinyx Confidential  30  
Treatment Period (Week 2, Visit 3) 
Subjects will return to the clinic at the end of Week 2 for assessment of compliance with study 
m
edication, use of rescue medication, and be dispensed the final 2-week supply of 
inve
stigational product and rescue medication for DPN pain. Pain diary compliance will be 
re
viewed by the study staff, and reporting instructions will be reinforced. Adverse events will be 
assessed  by asking the subject a non-leading question; for example, “Have you experienced any 
new or changed sym
ptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” Use of concomitant 
medications will be documented. Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse after 5 minutes) 
will
 be measured. Blood samples will be collected for liver function testing. Female subjects of 
childbearing potential will be counseled to continue using highly effective contraception.  
Subjects will be instructed to continue entering their average pain intensity, worst pain intensity, 
pain upon walking, and rescue medication use over the past 24 hours into their study-issued 
handheld devices every night. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will complete the DSIS 
via their study-issued handheld device.  
Scal
es to be completed at the Week 2 visit include the PGI-C, the S- STS,  and the Insomnia 
Sever
ity Index. 
One week following the Week 2 visit, subjects will be contacted by telephone for an assessment 
of adverse events and to reinforce diary completion.  
 
Treatment Period (Week 4/Early Termination, Visit 4) 
During the Week 4 or Early Termination Visit, subjects will be evaluated for compliance with 
study medication, and return all materials and unused study medication/rescue medication to the 
study site. The study-issued handheld device will be returned. Pain diary compliance will be 
reviewed by the study staff.  Adverse events will be assessed by asking the subject  a non -leading 
question; for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last 
aske
d/since your last visit?” Use of concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs 
(sitting blood pressure and pulse after 5 minutes ) and body weight  will be measur ed, brief 
physical examination performed, and subjects will undergo a 5-minute electrocardiogram. Blood 
and ur
ine samples will be collected for chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing. Female 
subjects of childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local urine testing kit. 
Subjec
ts will undergo drug and alcohol screen using a local urine testing kit and breathalyzer, 
respectively. 
Scales to be completed at the Week 4/Early Termination Visit include BPI-DPN, PGI-C, 
SF-MPQ-2, HADS, QOL-DN, Insomnia Severity Index, and S- STS.  
 
Follow-Up Visit (Week 5/7 days Post-Treatment, Visit 5) 
Subjects will return to the study site 7 days following the Week 4/Early Termination visit to 
assess adverse events and concomitant medication use. The adverse event assessment will 
inc
lude any serious adverse events that were ongoing at the time of study completion, and

Aptinyx Confidential  35 6.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designs provide unbiased estimates of 
efficacy and safety. Withdrawal of all but 1 concomitant analgesic medication during the 
Screening Period is expected to reduce inter-subject variability in treatment response ( Katz 2005, 
Katz
 2015 ) . The 1-month duration of treatment is considered sufficient to identify clinically 
im
portant pain relief. 
Only masked versions of the informed consent and protocol will be provided to study sites. The 
masked ver
sions will obscure the number of dose groups (i.e., the probability of receiving 
placebo) and the ra
ndomization criteria ( Section 7.1) . Mas king is expected to reduce variability 
in treatment response and to reduce the response to placebo. 
6.3 Justification of Dose 
Multiple dose levels of NYX-2925 are planned. No dose is more than 1/6th of  the maximum 
single dose (1200 mg) given in phase 1, which was safe and well-tolerated. Further, no dose is 
more than 2/9th of the maximum multiple dose (900 mg) given once daily for 7 days in phase 1, 
which was sa
fe and well-tolerated. Both the 1200 mg single dose and the 900 mg multiple dos e 
were associated with pharmacokinetic exposures (maximum concentration and area under the 
concentratio
n curve) below the no-observed-adverse-effect levels for both the dog and rat in the 
Good Laboratory Practice toxicology studies. NYX-2925 has a terminal elimination half-life of 4 
to 5 hours and demonstrated no accumulation with once daily dosing over 7 days in phase 1. This 
is c
onsistent 
with pharmacokinetic data in rats and dogs, following much higher doses over six 
weeks. Approximately 65% of the NYX-2925 dose is eliminated as unchanged drug in the urine. 
Thus, no drug accumulation is expected in this study. Both male and female subjects were 
included in the phase 1 studies and provide adequate support for studying both female and male 
subjects wi
th neuropathic pain, when using appropriate contraception precautions. Thus, the 
selected dose strengths chosen for this study are well supported by the available preclinical and 
clinical safety and pharmacokinetic data. The 28-day duration of exposure to NYX-2925 in this 
study is support
ed by the general toxicology studies in rats and dogs, comprising 42 and 55 daily 
doses, respectively. 
The dose strengths of NYX-2925 planned for this study are expected to produce maximum 
plasma concent
rations ranging from approximately 170 to 3400 ng/mL. These levels 
approximate the plasma maximum concentration associated with efficacy in the rat Bennett, 
Taxol®, and streptozotocin models. In those pharmacology models, analgesia was observed at 
doses between 1 and 30 mg/kg, corresponding to maximum plasma concentrations levels of 210 
to 4500 ng/mL, respectively. Brain exposure in humans, as measured in CSF, is anticipated to 
approximate the CSF levels measured in rats at analgesic doses. Additionally, the anticipated 
CSF levels in humans should be 3- to 6-orders of magnitude greater than the NYX-2925 
concentration ass
ociated with half-maximal response at the NMDAR target.  
Preclinical data support 
daily dosing as sufficient to result in efficacy in pain syndromes. First, 
when given to rats, NYX-2925 enhances hippocampal long-term potentiation at 24 hours and as 
much as 1 week foll
owing a single-oral dose. This enhancement of synaptic plasticity is a 
probable mechanism for the long duration of effects in the pain models. Following a single oral 
dose in the rat Bennett model of neuropathic pain, analgesic activity was consistently seen at 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-2001   Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  36 24 hours post-dose, and in some experiments at 1 week post-dose. In a rat Bennett model 
exper
iment that included gabapentin as a positive control, gabapentin was active only at the 
1-hour time point. In the rat Taxol® model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, NYX-2925 was 
active at both 24 hours and 1 week after administration of a single dose, whereas the positive 
cont
rol, bupivacaine, was active only at the 1-hour testing interval. Gabapentin (150 mg/kg 
ora
lly) was inactive in this model. Finally, in the rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic 
neuropathy, NYX-2925 analgesic activity was also evident at 24 hours and 1 week following a 
singl
e dose. Given that the mean elimination half-life of NYX-2925 in the rat is approximately 
2 hours, these data indicate that the analgesic activity of NYX-2925, which is consistently 
pre
sent for 24 hours after a single dose and often present for a week, persists beyond the 
pre
sence of drug in the rat. Along with the corresponding 1-week persistence of effects on the 
enhanc
ement of synaptic plasticity, the proposed underlying mechanism of drug action, the rat 
pain model data support the idea that NYX-2925 effects will persist for at least 24 hours 
following a single dose in humans. Taken together, these preclinical data support daily dosing in 
humans.

Aptinyx Confidential  45 9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
9.1 Screening Assessments 
9.1.1 Masqueradi ng Disorders Tool 
The Masquerading Disorders Tool (Analgesic Solutions, Wayland, MA) is a screening 
instrument to help identify subjects with disorders that masquerade as painful diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy, such as Morton’s neuroma, peripheral vascular disease, Achilles tendonitis, arthritis, 
and tarsal tunnel syndrome. The screening instrument consists of symptom screening questions, 
and an in-clinic history and examination to target the nature and etiology of the subject’s 
peripheral pain. The results of this assessment tool are provisional, with the final decision based 
on the clinical judgment of the investigator. 
9.1.2 Mi chigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument 
The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument is a 15-item, self-administered questionnaire 
and a lower 
extremity examination that includes inspection of vibratory sensation and ankle 
reflexes. It can be used to assess distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy in diabetes 
(Herman 2012 ). 
9.1.3 Bedside Sensory Test ing Kit 
The Bedside Sensory Testing K it (Analgesic Solutions, Wayland, MA) is used to assess a 
subject’s sensory profile to allow phenotypic identification of subgroups of subjects with painful 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy who might respond differently to a given treatment. The kit 
consists of multiple sensory instruments that are applied to different peripheral anatomic sites to 
evaluate
 the following phenomena: extent of damage of low threshold mechanoreceptive small 
fibers in the
 feet, dynamic mechanical allodynia, punctate hyperalgesia, high threshold 
m
echanoreceptive function, and cold allodynia. 
9.1.4 Ameri can College of Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Criteria 
The 2010 American College of Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Criteria is a clinician-administered 
survey that is used as a d
iagnostic tool for fibromyalgia. The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia 
are met by the following 3 conditions:  
 Widespread Pain Index ≥7 and Symptom Severity Score ≥5, or the Widespr ead Pain 
Index is 3 to 6 and the Symptom Severity Score is ≥9;  
 S ymptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months; and 
 Subject does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the pain ( W olfe 2010).  
9.2 Efficacy
 Assessments 
9.2.1 Nu meric Rating Scale of Pain Intensity (NRS) 
The NRS of pain intensity is a unidimensional, segmented numeric version of the visual analog 
scale
. A subject selects a whole number (0 to 10) that best indicates the intensity of his/her pain. 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-2001   Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  46 The format consists of a horizontal line which is anchored by terms defining pain levels where 
0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain imaginable. 
Subjec
ts will r
eport at bedtime their average pain intensity, worst pain intensity, and pain upon 
walking during the past 24 hours, using the 11-point NRS. 
9.2.2 Pati ent Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) 
The PGI-C is a 7-point scale that allows subjects to rate the change in the disease state from 
study
 initiation to specific tim
e points during the study or at the end of the study. It provides the 
subject’s impression of overall change since beginning the study. 
9.2.3 Short -Form McGill Pain Que stionnaire, version 2 (SF-MPQ-2) 
The SF-MPQ-2 measures the sensory, affective, and evaluative qualities of pain, including 
sym
ptoms relevant to neuropathic pain. The tool includes visual analogue as well as verbal rating 
scales of pain intensity on a total of 22 neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain descriptors that are 
each evaluated on a 
10-point numerical rating scale ( Dworkin 2009).  
9.2.4 Norfol k Quality of Life Questionnaire – Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL -DN) 
The Norfolk QOL -DN is a 47 -item, subject -reported questionnaire designed to measure the 
relationship between symptomatic diabetic neuropathy and quality of life from the perspective of 
the patient. It is composed of 2 parts: questions related to symptoms e xperienced by the patient 
and questions related to the impact of the patient's neuropathy on activities of daily life. A factor 
analysis performed on the Norfolk QOL -DN separated the questions into 5 domains: activities of 
daily living, symptoms, small fib er neuropathy, large fiber neuropathy, and autonomic 
neuropathy.  The QOL -DN is sensitive to the different features of diabetic neuropathy including 
small fiber, large fiber, and autonomic nerve function ( Vinik  2005).  
9.2.5 Hospi tal Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
The HADS is a self-reported screening tool for anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric clinical 
populations.  The scale consists of 14 items (7 each for anxiety and depression), each rated on a 
4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very often). Responses are based on the relative 
frequency of symptoms over the preceding week. Possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each 
subscale. An analysis of scores on the two subscales supported the differentiation of each mood 
state into four ranges: ‘non cases’ (scores 0-7), ‘mild cases’ (scores 8-10), ‘moderate cases’ 
(scores 11-15), and ‘severe cases’ (scores 16 or higher) ( Zigmond 1983 ). 
9.2.6 Insomnia Severity Index 
The ISI is a 7 -item self -report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact o f 
insomnia. The usual recall period is the “last month” and the dimensions evaluated are: severity 
of sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, 
interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, n oticeability of sleep problems by 
others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5 -point Likert scale is used to rate each 
item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. 
The total score is inter preted as follows: absence of insomnia ( 0–7); sub -threshold insomnia 
(8-14); moderate insomnia (15 –21); and severe insomnia (22 –28) (Bast ien  2001) .

  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  47 9.2.7 Daily Sl eep Interference Scale (DSIS) 
The DSIS was developed to quantify sleep interference due to pain. The DSIS is a single-item 
measure that is completed by patients once a day (upon awakening) to accurately capture 
variability in sleep interference due to pain on a daily basis, thus minimizing recall bias. The 
DSIS has an 11-point response scale that asks patients to ‘‘Select the number that best describes 
how much your pain has
 interfered with your sleep during the past 24 hours.’’ Response options 
range from 0 (Did not interfere with sleep) to 10 (Completely interfered with sleep / unable to 
sleep due to pain). The DSIS is designed to be used in a patient daily diary that patients fill out 
upon awakening each morning ( Vernon 2008).  
9.2.8 Brief  Pain Inventory for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (BPI-DPN) 
The BPI is a patient-completed numeric rating scale that assesses the severity of pain (Severity 
scale), its impact on daily functioning (Interference scale), and other aspects of pain (e.g., 
location of pain, relief from medications). A modified version of the BPI, including the 4-item 
pain Severity scale (Worst Pain, Least Pain, Average Pain, and Pain Now) and the 7-item pain 
Interference scale (General Activity, Mood, Walking Ability, Normal Work, Relations With 
Others, Sleep, Enjoyment of Life) has been validated in patients with painful diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy), which distinguishes between pain due to DPN and pain due to other causes. Each 
BPI item uses a 0-10 numeric rating scale anchored at zero for “no pain” and 10 for “pain as bad 
as you can imagine” for Severity, and “does not interfere” to “completely interferes” for 
Interference. The 4 Severity items and the 7 Interference items can also each be averaged to form 
2 composite scores, the Pain Severity Index and the Pain Interference Index ( Zelm an 2005).

Aptinyx Confidential  48 9.3.4 Elect rocardiogram 
Electrocardiograms (5-minute duration) will be collected after 5 minutes of supine rest and prior 
to blood sample collection, if possible. The device will be a Spaulding electrocardiogram device 
that acquires a 12-lead electrocardiogram continuously at each time point for up to 5 minutes. 
The 5 minutes of electrocardiogram data will be converted into a summary electrocardiogram 
(simulated 10-second electrocardiogram) for each electrocardiogram time point and submitted to 
the designated electrocardiogram laboratory cardiologists for measurements and diagnoses as 
though it were a standard 10-second electrocardiogram. Electrocardiograms may be repeated for 
elig
ibility assessments.  
The investigator or qualified sub-investigator will review all electrocardiogram interpretations 
and interval duration measurements for clinical significance. Standard electrocardiogram 
parameters will be measured. Clinically significant, abnormal 12-lead electrocardiograms should 
be repeated. Clinically significant electrocardiogram changes should be recorded as an adverse 
event.  
The Spaulding electrocardiogram device should be used for all assessments during the study 
unless it is non-operational, in which case another electrocardiogram may be performed locally 
and transmitted to Spaulding for central reading via printout. 
9.3.5 Clini cal Laboratory Assessments  
Blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology will be obtained after an 8-hour fast, except 
for the Week 2 and Week 5 liver function tests. The study investigator should monitor subjects 
during the study for signs of hepatic abnormality potentially meeting the stopping criteria 
(Section 11 ).  
The investigator will review clinical laboratory test results as they become available, for 
det
ermination and documentation of clinical significance (if there are out of range values). The 
investigative site will contact the medical monitor for any liver function test results that 
potent
ially meet the stopping criteria. Possibly drug related or clinically relevant abnormal 
val
ues of uncertain causality must be repeated. Persistently abnormal laboratory values should be 
followed at
 the investigator’s discretion. Clinical labs may be repeated for eligibility 
asse
ssments. Abnormal liver function tests (specified in section 11) must be repeated within 48-
72 hours. 
Hematology assessments will include total white blood cell count, differential (neutrophils, 
lym
phocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), hemoglob in, hematocrit, red blood cell 
count
, platelet count and HbA1c (at Visit 1). 
Serum chemistry assessments will include electrolytes (bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, 
phosphorous
, potassium, sodium, and magnesium), enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate 
am
inotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and gamma-glutamyl 
transferase), and other (albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, creatinine, 
glucose, tr
iglycerides (at screening), total protein, blood urea nitrogen, and uric acid). 
Quali
tative urinalysis will include pH, specific gravity, glucose, ketones, protein, blood, 
leukocyte esterase, urobilinogen, nitrites, and reflex microscopy.

Aptinyx Confidential  49 All women of childbearing potential will receive urine  pregnancy tests (ß - human chorionic 
gonadotropin).   
The urine drug panel will include cannabinoids, opioid s, and benzodiazepines; an alcohol screen 
will
 also be performed with a breathalyzer.  
Hepatitis and HIV screen includes: Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and HIV. If 
the
 screening hepatitis C antibody test result is reactive, a nucleic acid test for HCV RNA should 
be performed for confirmation of chronic infection. If the screening HIV test is positive, a 
confirmatory Western Blot test should be performed to confirm HIV status. 
 
9.3.6 Sheehan S uicidality Tracking Scale (S-STS) 
T
he standard version of the S-STS ( Sheehan 2014[2] ) i s a 16-item scale that assesses the 
seriousness of suicidality phenomena on a Likert-type scale (0 to 4) ranging from 0 = “not at all” 
(0) to 4 = “extremely”. It also assesses the frequency of key phenomena and the overall time 
spent in suicidality. The standard version is available in identical clinician- and subject-rated 
format
s. The S-STS accommodates a wide range of time frames. In clinical trials, the frequently 
used variants are “in the past week”, “in the past month”, “since the last visit”, “lifetime look 
back
”, and “in the past day”.  
The 
S-STS maps to both the C-CASA, and to all of the categories in the FDA Draft Guidance 
docum
ents of both 2010 and 2012, and in addition provides coverage for all suicidal phenomena 
presented in the draft FDA guidance. The S-STS has been studied and validated against other 
instruments used for the assessment of suicidality in a study, and been shown provide at least 
equal sensitivity to detecting suicidal ideation and behavior ( Sheehan 2014 [1] ). 
Suicidality identified after baseline will be recorded as an adverse event. 
9.4 Safety and Pharmacovigilance 
9.4.1 Ad verse Events –  Relationship to Investigational Product 
An adverse event is any untoward, undesired, unplanned clinical event in the form of signs, 
symptom
s, disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a human being 
participating in a clinical study with an Aptinyx investigational product, regardless of causal 
relationship. A pre-existing condition is one that is present before investigational product dosing 
and is repo
rted as part of the subject’s medical history. Pre-existing conditions should be 
reported as an adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or character of the pre-existing 
condition worsens during the
 course of the study. 
Laboratory abnormalities are not considered adverse events unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. However, a laboratory abnormality 
(e.g., a clinically significant change detected on clinical chemistry, coagulation, hematology, 
urinalysis) that is independent from the underlying medical condition and that requires medical 
or surgical intervention, or leads to investigational product interruption or discontinuation, must 
be considered an 
adverse event.

9.4.2 Recording Adverse Events 
A “pre-existing” condition is one that is present before investigational product dosing and is 
reported as part of the subject’s medical history. Pre-existing conditions should be reported as an 
adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or character of the pre- existing condition worsens 
during the course of the study. Adverse events will be collected from the time the informed 
consent is signed to the end of the subject’s participation in the study. 
Subjects should be instructed to report all potential adverse events to the investigator, and, 
queried in a non-leading manner, without specific prompting (e.g., “How are you feeling?”). The 
sit
e study staff should assess emerging symptoms of dissociative reaction similar to those caused 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-2001   Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  51 by NMDA antagonists including memory impairment, disturbance in time, body or 
environmental perception, stilted speech, emotional withdrawal, impaired coordination, motor 
retardation, bizarre reasoning or illusory experiences in any sensory perception, or confused 
state; such symptoms may be captured as adverse event s. 
To avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, all adverse events should be recorded in 
standard medical terminology rather than in the subject’s own words. Each adverse event will 
al
so be described in terms of duration (start and stop date), severity, relationship to 
investigational product, action(s) taken, and outcome. Diagnoses (rather than symptoms) should 
be recorded wherever possible. 
9.4.3 Reporti ng Adverse Events 
All adverse events must be documented, evaluated, an d re ported in the source documents and 
eCRF. Adverse event collection begins after the subject has completed the informed consent and 
cont
inues until the subject’s participation in the study ends. Ongoing adverse events should be 
followed 
to a satisfactory resolution in the investigator’s opinion. Subjects should be instructed 
to r
eport all adverse events to the investigator. In addition, the investigator should seek to elicit 
any cl
inical or objective reactions by specific questioning (e.g., “How have you been feeling?”) 
and as
 appropriate by examination. Information on all adverse events should be recorded on the 
eCRF. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and results of diagnostic procedures performed in 
relation to an adverse event should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis.   
9.4.3.1 Severi ty of Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be assessed for severity, using the following general grading scale: 
Mild: Transient or mild discomfort (<48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required. 
Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity – some assistance may be needed; no or 
m
inimal medical intervention/therapy required. 
Severe: Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy,  required hospitalization possible. 
Life
 threatening: Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant 
m
edical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization, or hospice care probable. 
W
hen changes in the severity of an adverse event occur more frequently than once a day, the 
m
aximum severity for the experience that day should be noted. If the severity category changes 
over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset 
dates). 
9.4.3.2 Acti on Taken for Adverse Events 
For ea
ch reported adverse event, an investigator must document the action taken according to the 
following criteria: 
 No acti on taken 
 Concomitant medication taken 
 Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-2001   Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  52  Discont inued study 
 Nondrug therapy  
 Other  (specify) 
The inves
tigator must also document the action taken in regards to investigational product (as a 
re
sult of a given adverse event) according to the following criteria: 
 Dose not changed 
 Inve stigational product interrupted 
 Inve stigational product withdrawn 
 Not appli cable 
 Unknow n 
9.4.3.3 Outc ome for Adverse Events 
Adverse events should be followed until resolution. For each reported adverse event, the 
investigator must document the outcome according to the following criteria: 
 Fata l 
 Not re covered/not resolved  
 Recover ed/resolved 
 Recover ed/resolved with sequelae 
 Recovering/resolving 
 Unknow n 
9.5 Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events are reported to the sponsor-designated medical monitor using the Aptinyx 
provided form by email or fax at: 
  
  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
 Death: “Death” is an outcome and is NOT the adverse event. In the event of death, 
the cause of death should be recorded as the adverse event. The only exception is 
“sudden death” when the cause is unknown. 
 Is a life-threatening experience: Life-threatening adverse events include any adverse 
drug experie
nce, which, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurs. It does not include a reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death. 
 Requir es inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 

 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-2001   Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  53  Result s in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity : Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 Result s in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Additi onally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life 
thr
eatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
previously. Example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home. 
All serious adverse events that result in death or are life threatening, regardless of causal 
re
lationship, must be reported to the sponsor-designated medical monitor within 24 hours of the 
sit
e’s knowledge of the event. A copy of the initial serious adverse event report must be received 
withi
n 1 business day. 
All ot
her serious adverse events or other events reportable to the United States Food and Drug 
Ad
ministration (FDA) and/or IRB will be forwarded to the sponsor-designated medical monitor 
withi
n 1 business day. 
The serious adverse event report should provide as much of the required information as is 
avai
lable at the time. The following minimum information is required for reporting a serious 
adverse event: subject identification, reporting source, and an event outcome. Supplemental 
information may be transmitted using a follow-up report and should not delay the initial report. 
Aptinyx may contact the investigational site to solicit additional information or to follow-up on 
the event. 
If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes a serious adverse event, the information 
will be treated as a serious adverse event for the purposes of this protocol. Serious adverse event 
re
porting will begin at the time of consent and will end 30 days after the last dose.   
All r
elevant documentation pertaining to a serious adverse event (additional laboratory tests, 
consul
tation reports, discharge summaries, postmortem reports, etc.) will be provided to the 
sponsor-designated medical monitor in a timely manner. Serious adverse events will be followed 
unti
l resolution or return to baseline (when worsening of a pre-existing condition is reported). If 
a se
rious adverse event does not return to baseline but reaches a stable situation that is not 
expec
ted to change, this may be documented on the serious adverse event form. 
The Sponsor 
may break the treatment code for subjects who experience a serious adverse event 
in order to determine if the individual case or group of cases required expedited regulatory 
reporting. Individual treatment codes will be available to limited staff who are responsible to 
break codes for reporting purposes. 
All serious adverse events will be reported to the FDA. 
9.6 Other Re
portable Events 
Reports of overdose (with or without an adverse event), abuse, dependency, inadvertent or 
accidental exposure, pregnancy, and unexpected therapeutic benefit should be forwarded in the 
same timeframe as a serious adverse event. Overdose occurs when a subject is dosed or has taken 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-2001   Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  54 a dose greater than the intended or scheduled dose specified by the protocol. All pregnancies 
occur
ring during the study must be followed for information regarding the course of pregnancy, 
delivery, and condition of the newborn. Follow-up should be provided by the investigator to the 
sponsor-designated medical monitor in a timely manner. When the newborn is healthy, further 
follow
-up is not necessary. Male subjects must inform the investigator if their partner becomes 
pre
gnant during the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential and female partners of male 
subjects must use an acceptable method of birth control during the participation in this study.

Aptinyx Confidential  61 12 STATISTICS 
12.1 Sample Size Determination 
The planned sample size is 300 randomized subjects. This sample size will provide 
appr
oximately 80% power for a 2-sided t-test with Type I error of 0.048.  
12
.2 Randomization 
Daily pain scores and diary compliance will be transferred into the interactive response 
technology system, which will be used to assess the criteria for randomization. Subjects whose 
mean of the daily average pain intensity score during the preceding 7 (±1) days is within the 
protocol-defined algorithm and with adequate compliance with daily diary completion will be 
eligible for randomization. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either NYX-2925 or placebo for 4 weeks in a 
pre-specified allocation. The randomization will be stratified by study site. 
12.3 Statistical Analysis Plan 
The planned statistical analysis methods, including procedures for accounting for missing, 
unused, and spurious data, will be described in more detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan, which 
will
 be finalized prior to study completion. Deviations from the original Statistical Analysis Plan 
will
 be described in the final clinical study report.  
Descriptive statistics for categorical variables will include the number and percent of subjects 
with e
ach characteristic. Percentages will be based on the number of subjects with non-missing 
values. Descriptive statistics for ordinal and continuous variables will include the number of 
subj
ects with non-missing values, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum value, and 
m
aximum value. 
All relevant data collected in the eCRF will be shown for each subject in the individual subject 
data listings. 
12.4 Analysis Populations 
Safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population, which is defined as all subjects who 
receive at least 1 dose of investigational product. 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the modified Intent- to-Treat Population, which is defined as 
all subjects in the Safety Population with at least 1 post baseline assessment of the pain intensity 
NRS .

Aptinyx Confidential  62 12.5 Analyses of Efficacy  
12.5.1 Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint 
12.5.1.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the daily pain intensity NRS score from the handheld device 
will be 
averaged for baseline (Days -7 to -1 ) and  Week 4 (Days 22 to 28) after randomization. 
Change from baseline to Week 4 will be assessed for treatment group differences with an 
analysis of covariance with fixed factors for study site and treatment, with baseline value as a 
covariate. 
12.5.1.2  Sensitivity Analysis 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the daily pain intensity NRS score from the handheld device 
will be 
averaged for baseline (Days -7 to -1 ) and  each week (Days 1 to 7, Days 8 to 14, Days 15 
to 21,
 and Days 22 to 28) after randomization. A mixed model repeated measures analysis of 
var
iance will be used to assess treatment differences. The model will include factors for study 
site, treatment, week, and the treatment-by-week interaction, with baseline value as a covariate. 
12.5.2 Ot her Efficacy Endpoints 
Change in the mean NRS score assessing average pain intensity in the past 24 hours from 
baseline (average of Days -7 to -1) to each week of treatment (average of Days 1 through 7, 
Days 8 through 14, and Days 15 through 21) will be assessed for treatment group differences 
with a
n analysis of covariance with fixed factors for study site and treatment, with baseline value 
as a covariate. Change from baseline for the PGI-C, SF-MPQ-2, QOL-DN, Insomnia Severity 
Index, HADS, DSIS, BPI-DPN will be analyzed similarly. 
The use of rescue medication and percent of subjects meeting responder criteria (≥30% reduction 
and first ≥50% reduction in the NRS average pain intensity) will be summarized descriptive ly. 
The number of days to the first ≥30% reduction and first ≥50% reduction in the NRS average 
pai
n intensity and the number of days to sustained pain reduction will be assessed for treatment 
group diff
erences with the log-rank test. Subjects who fail to achieve the target reduction will be 
cens
ored at the end of their final week with NRS pain intensity measurements. 
12.5.3 Mult iple Comparisons 
The primary efficacy endpoint and primary statistical analysis are protocol-specified. A Type I 
error
 of 0.005 will be allocated to the interim analysis (if applicable) and a Type I error of 0.048 
will be allocated to the final analysis ( Fleming 1984 ). There will be no adjustment for multiple 
treatment group comparisons in this phase 2 study. 
12.6 Ana
lyses of Safety  
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical testing will be performed.

Aptinyx Confidential  63 12.6.1 Ad verse Events 
A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving investigational 
produc
t, or a continuing adverse event diagnosed prior to the date of first dose of investigational 
product
, which increases in severity after the start of dosing. Adverse events will be categorized 
by system organ class and preferred term with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Summary tables for TEAEs will include number and percent of subjects experiencing TEAEs by 
syst
em organ class and preferred term. If a subject has more than 1 TEAE that codes to the same 
preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that preferred term. Similarly, if a 
subject has more than 1 TEAE within a system organ class category, the subject will be counted 
only once in that system organ class category.  
The following TEAE summaries will be provided for the Screening Period and Treatment Period 
(i
ncluding Follow-Up) :  
 O verall summary of TEAEs  
 TEA Es by system organ class and preferred term  
 Drug -related TEAEs by system organ class and preferred term 
 TEA Es by system organ class, preferred term, and severity 
Serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to investigational product discontinuation will be identified. 
12.6.2  Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Mean change from baseline (Visit 2) to Week 4 (Visit 4) will be summarized descriptively for 
each analyte. 
Clinical laboratory results considered clinically important by the investigator will be identified. 
Individual
 results for clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) 
outsi
de the normal range will be flagged in the data listings.  
Clinical laboratory 
assessments will be conducted by the following central laboratory: 
  
  
  
 
 
  
12.6.3  Electrocardiogram 
The interpretation of electrocardiogram and interval duration measurements by the designated 
electrocardiogram laboratory cardiologists will be reviewed by the investigator. Clinically 
signi
ficant deteriorations from baseline will be reported and summarized as TEAEs. 
12.6.4  Vital Sign Measurement s  
Change from baseline to each scheduled measurement will be summarized descriptively. 
Baseline will be defined as the last evaluation prior to dosing with investigational product on 
Day 1.

.7 Interim Analysis 
One interim analysis may be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects (i.e., approximately 
150 subjects) have completed Visit 4. Based on the interim analysis, 1 or more dose groups of 
NYX
-2925 could be discontinued and the total sample size re-estimated. A Type I error of 0.005 
would be allocated to the interim analysis. Complete details of the interim analysis would be 
provi
ded in a separate analysis plan. It is not anticipated that the interim analysis would lead the

investigator or a subinvestigator listed on the FDA Form 1572. It is the responsibility of the 
principal investigator to ensure the eCRFs are completed and submitted to Aptinyx (or designee) 
in an accurate and timely manner. The processing of eCRFs will include an audit trail (to include 
changes made, reason for change, date of change and person making the change). 
13.4 Protocol Amendment(s) 
If a protocol has been filed with regulatory agencies or submitted to an IRB and requires 
changes, a protocol amendment must be written. The sponsor will make changes to the protocol. 
All amendments will be sent to a central IRB on the study sites’ behalf, if applicable. Sites using 
a local IRB are responsible for submitting the amendment for review and approval. 
13.5 Audits and Inspections 
During the course of the study, or after completion of the study, each study site may be subject to 
an audit by an Aptinyx Quality Assurance Auditor (or an auditor appointed by Aptinyx or its 
aut
horized representative) and/or an inspector from the FDA and/or other regulatory authority. 
Every attempt will be made to notify the investigator in writing in advance of the audit.

This protocol, the informed consent document, and all relevant supporting data must be 
submitted to the IRB for approval. Institutional Review Board approval of the protocol, informed 
conse
nt document, any subject-facing materials, and any advertisement used to recruit study 
subjects must be obtained before the study may be initiated. The IRB must comply with 
re
quirements set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 56. 
The inves
tigator is responsible for keeping the IRB advised of the progress of the study, changes 
to research activity, unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others, and any 
change
s made to the protocol as deemed appropriate, but in any case, at least once a year. The 
investigator is also responsible for notifying the IRB of any significant adverse events or 
protocol deviations that occur during the study, and meet IRB reporting requirements. 
The investigator agrees that he or she will not make any changes in the research without IRB 
approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects, as 
referenced in 21 CFR 312.66. 
13.7 Compliance with Regulatory Requirements 
This protocol will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and all regulatory requirements, 
in accordance with GCP, including ICH Guidelines, and in general conformity with the most 
re
cent version of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
13.8 Informed Consent 
Written informed consent must be obtained from potential study participants prior to the 
initiation of non-routine study-related tests. The original signed informed consent form for each 
par
ticipating subject shall be filed with records kept by the investigators(s). A copy of the signed 
inform
ed consent document must be provided to the subject. If applicable, written consent will 
be obtained using a certified translation. If the informed consent form is revised, subjects must 
be re-
consented in a timely manner. 
13.9 Study File Management 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study files are maintained. The study file will 
include, but is not limited to, source documents, correspondence, regulatory documents (IRB 
approvals/correspondence, study logs, FDA 1572 forms, financial disclosures, clinical study 
material records, investigational product accountability records, and medical records).

local laws and regulations on personal health information protection. 
Moni
tors, auditors, and other authorized agents of Aptinyx, the IRB approving this research and 
appl
icable regulatory authorities will be granted direct access to the study subjects’ original 
medical records for verification of clinical study procedures and/or data, without violating the 
confidentiality of the subjects, to the extent permitted by the law and regulations. In any 
presentation of the results of this study at meetings or in publications, the subjects’ identity will 
remain confidential. 
13.12 Compensation, Insurance, and Indemnity 
Information regarding compensation, insurance, and indemnity is addressed in the Clinical Trial 
Research Agreement. 
13.13 Financial Disclosure 
The investigator(s) are responsible for providing financial disclosure(s) in covered clinical 
studies. Principal investigators and subinvestigators are required to disclose applicable financial 
inform
ation, and to promptly update Aptinyx with any relevant changes throughout the study and 
for 1 year after study completion. 
13.14 Records Retention 
According to United States Investigational New Drug regulations (21 CFR 312.62), records and 
docum
ents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational product s 
including but not limited to source documents, eCRFs, informed consent forms, clinical 
laboratory test results, and drug inventory records will be retained. These records will be kept on 
file by the principal investigator for 2 years after a marketing application is approved for the drug 
for the indication for which it is being studied. If no application is filed or approved, these 
records must be kept for 2 years after the investigation has been discontinued and the FDA has 
been notified. Per ICH guidelines, documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the 
last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. Aptinyx will notify 
the
 investigator when records and documents no longer need to be retained. No study records 
should be destroyed without prior authorization.

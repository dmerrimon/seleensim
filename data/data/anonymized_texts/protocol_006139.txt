1.4 Stud y design and treatment
This is a randomized, sham controlled, rater blinded, parallel group des ign.Approximately  102 
subjects will be randomized (with a ratio 1:1) in the following groups:
- Group A: Clinician
-directed pharmacotherap y + PEAR -004.
-Group B: Clinical directed pharmacotherap y + Sham application.
An up to 28 -day screening period will include standard screening assessments as defined in the
assessment schedule. Eligible subjects will be randomized on day 1 into one of the treatment
groups. Subjects in both groups will continue to receive their clinician -directed standard of care
treatment for schizophrenia, including pharmacotherapy . Subjects in Group A will use PEAR-
004 for a period of 12 weeks. Subjects in Group B will use a sham for a period of 12 weeks.
Subjects will return to the clinic for outpatient visits at week 4 (day  29), week 8 (day 57), and
week 12 (day 85). At each visit, standard assessments will be performed according to the
assessment schedule, including PANSS, ISST-Plus, CGI , BMQ, MAP -SR, WHOQOL -BREF,
BDI-II, ISI, and Adverse Events (AEs). A final follow -up visit will be performed at week 16
(day 115), including the assessments as detailed in the assessment schedule. A graphical 
description of the described pro cedure is presented in Figure 1-1.

3 I nterim analy ses
Interim analyses may be conducted to support decision making concerning the current clinical 
study , the sponsor’s clinical development projects in general or in case of any  safety  concerns. 
In this case,the analyses as described in the sections below are conducted for the relevant 
endpoints.
4 Statistical methods: A nalysis sets
The Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) population will serve as the primary population for the anal ysis of 
efficacy  data in this trial. The FAS comprises all subjects to whom study  treatment has been 
assigned by randomization and who have a baseline observation and at least one post-
randomization observation for the anal ysis endpoint. According to the intent -to-treat principle, 
subjects will be analy zed according to the treatment they have been assigne d to during the 
randomization procedure. The baseline is defined as the last measurement obtained before 
administration of the randomized treatment intervention (PEAR- 004/Sham) on Day  1. 
Corporate Confidential Information

SAP CPEA001A12201
The Safety  Set includes all randomized subjects who received the study  treatment, with subjects
included in the treatment group corresponding to the treatment they actually  received. While no 
per-protocol analy sis is planned, a list of protocol violators (e.g. subjects with lack ofstudy 
treatment compliance change in background therapy  during the trial) will be finalized prior to 
analysis.
The anal ysis sets and protocol deviation codes are related as follows:

DBL .
5 Statistical methods for P harmacokinetic (PK) parameters
Not applicable.
6 Statistical methods for efficacy parameters
6.1 Primary  objective
Theprimary  efficacy  endpoint in the study  is change in total PANSS score from baseline to day
85 or last visit, analy zed using the FAS.
6.1.1 Variables
PANSS score.
6.1.2 Statistical model, assumptions ,hypotheses and method of analysis
The change from baseline in total PANSS score will be analy zed using the mixed -effects model
for repeated measures (MMRM) (see Mallinckrodt et al (2001)), including the fixed, categorical
effects of treatment, visit (i.e., day 1, 29, 57, 85) , and treatment- by-visit interaction, as well as
the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score, baseline score -by-visit interaction, and 
disease duration at baseline. An unstructured (UN) covariance structure will be used to model 
the within -patient errors. The Kenward -Roger (KR) method will be used to adjust the estimated 
covariance of the mean difference and the degrees of freedom.

SAP CPEA001A12201
6.1.2.1 Model checking procedures
The primary  MMRM model implicitly  imputes missing data under a missing at   random (MAR) 
assumption. Therefore, no explicit imputation of missing data will be done for the primary 
analysis approach.
Two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the primary anal ysis to missing data results 
will be performed.

6.1.2.2 Graphical p resentation of results
Because there is a temporal component throughout the data, individual plots and model adjusted 
mean and 95% CIs plot showing the change from baseline over time will be presented.
6.2 Secondary  objectives
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints listed below will be anal yzed separatel y using an MMRM
analysis.The model will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score, 
baseline score -by-visit interaction, and disease duration at baseline (in years).
6.2.1 Variables
The change from baseline to each post- baseline visit, which will be the dependent variable.
6.2.2 Statistical methods for analy sis
The anal ysis strategy  will be the same as for the p rimary  outcome. The outcomes to be 
analyzed are :
Change from baseline in the positive PANSS score;
Change from baseline in the General Psy chopathology  PANSS score;
Change from baseline in the negative PANSS score;
Change from baseline in the MAP -SR score;
Change from baseline in the WHOQOL- BREF scale;
Change from baseline in the BDI -II total score .
In addition, the percentage change from baseline in the total PANSS score will be analyzed 
using an MMRM approach . Estimates of mean percentage change from baseline to ea ch study 
visit with (95% CIs) will be obtained for each treatment group (i.e., 100*(Post Baseline -
Baseline)/Baseline )).

The data from BMQ will be listed and summarized descriptivel y.
6.2.3 Sensitivity analy sis for the primary endpoint
6.2.3.1 Model checking procedures
The primary  MMRM model implicitly  imputes missing data under a missing at   random (MAR) 
assumption. Therefore, no explicit imputation of missing data will be done for the primary 
analysis approach.
6.2.3.2 Graphical p resentation of results
Because there is a temporal component throughout the data, individual plots andmodel adjusted 
with mean and 95 % CIs plot showing the change from baseline over time will be presented .
6.2.4 Supportive analy sis for the primary  endpoint
The last-observation -carried -forward (LOCF) approach will be applied to analyzethe change 
from baseline in the total PANSS score. These results will only be used to aid in the 
interpretation of the results from the primary  analysis.

SAP CPEA001A12201
adverse events (AEs) will summarize only  on-treatment events, with a start date during the 
on-treatment period ( treatment -emergent AEs).
7.1 Variables
Adverse events, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate , body  temperature ) and I SST-PLUS.
7.2 Descriptive analy ses
Subject demographics and other baseline characteristics
All data for background and demographic 
variables will be listed by treatment group and subject. 
Summary  statistics will be provided by  treatment group.
Relevant medical history, curre nt medical conditions and any other relevant information will 
be listed by treatment group and subject.
All data for background and demographic variables will be listed by treatment sequence and 
subject. Summary  statistics will be provided for all subjects, as well as for each treatment 
sequence.
Relevant medical history, current medical conditions, results of laboratory screens, drug tests 
and an y other relevant information will be listed by treatment and subject.
Treatments
The Safet y Set will be used for the anal yses below. Categorical data will be summarized as
frequencies and percentages. For continuous data, mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and
75th percentiles, minimum, and maximum will be presented.
The duration of exposure to the study  treatment will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
Concomitant medications and significant non -drug therapies prio r to and after the start of the
study  treatment will be listed and summarized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical (ATC) classification sy stem, by  treatment group.
Reasons for discontinuation for all patients will be listed and tabulated for both treatment 
groups. The median time to all- cause discontinuation will be compared between the treatment 
groups. The log -rank test will be used to test the null hy pothesis against the alternate 
hypothesis that the median time to discontinuation is not th e same between the groups.

Vital signs
All vital signs data will be listed by treatment, subject, and visit/time and if ranges are available 
abnormalities (and relevant orthostatic changes) will be flagged. Summary  statistics will be 
provided b y treatment and visit/time.
Adverse events
All information obtained on adverse events will be display ed by treatment and subject.
The number and percentage of subjects with adverse events will be tabulated by body system 
and preferred term with a breakdown by treatment. A subject with multiple adverse events 
within a body s ystem is only  counted once towards the total of this bod y systemand treatment .
For the legal requirements of ClinicalTrials.gov and EudraCT, two required tables on <on-
treatment/treatment emergent> adverse events which are not serious adverse events with an 
incidence greater than X% and on <on-treatment/treatment emergent> serious adverse events 
and SAE suspected to be related to study treatment will be provided by  system organ class and 
preferred t erm on the safety  set population.
If for a same patient, several consecutive AEs (irrespective of study  treatment causalit y, 
seriousness and severit y) occurred with the same SOC and PT:
a single occurrence will be counted if there is ≤ 1 day  gap between t he end date of the
preceding AE and the start date of the consecutive AE
more than one occurrence will be counted if there is > 1 day  gap between the end date
of the preceding AE and the start date of the consecutive AE .
For occurrence, the presence of at least one SAE / SAE suspected to be related to study 
treatment / non SAE has to be checked in a block e.g., among AE's in a ≤ 1 day  gap block, if at 
least one SAE is occurring, then one occurrence is calculated for that SAE.
The number of deaths resulting from SAEs suspected to be related to study  treatment and SAEs 
irrespective of study  treatment relationship will be provided b y SOC and PT.
Other safety  evaluations
ISST -Plus score data will be listed by treatment, subject and visit/time; abnormalities willbe
flagged. Summary  statistics will be provided by  treatment and visit/time as appropriate.
7.3 Graphical presentation 
Boxplots to visualize trends in longitudinal safet y data will be created.

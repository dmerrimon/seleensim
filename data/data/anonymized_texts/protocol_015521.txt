BACKGROUND/RATIONALE  
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP ) is an autoimmune neurological disorder that 
causes  limb weakness  and numbness .  Many patients require  immunosuppressants  and plasma exchange 
(PLEX)  to control their symptoms .  Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)  is also an  effective treatment  (Hughes 
et al, 2006 & 2008; Hughes, 2009; Cocito et al, 2010), and the American Academy of Neurology ( AAN)  
guideline recommended that it should be offered in the long- term treatment of CIDP (Patwa et al, 2012) .  While 
effective, IVIG  causes systemic side effects in about 5% of patients.  These side effects include rash, pruritus, 
myalgia, fever, chills, headac he, low back pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in blood pressure or heart rate, renal 
failure, and aseptic meningitis (Berger, 2008).  For many patients who are chronically treated with IVIG, 
venous access may be a problem over time.  An alternative is the s ubcutaneous (SC) route, which has been in 
use since 1980 for primary immune deficiency disorders and is the treatment of choice for this condition in 
Scandinavia and England (Radinsky et al, 2003).  As compared to IV route, SC route maintains higher trough 
levels of immunoglobulins , increases patient independence, reduces systemic side- effects,  and is better tolerated 
in those who are pregnant or  sensitized to IgA (Radinsky e t al, 2003).  In a review of side effects associated 
with 33,168 SCIG infusions, no severe or anaphylactoid reactions occurred ( Gardulf et al, 1995).  Patients can 
self-administer medication, and hence, overall cost may be reduced.  A retrospective study of 28 children with 
primary immunodeficiency in Canada showed that the mean difference in costs between IVIG and SCIG during 
the study period (1 year on IVIG and 1 year on SCIG) was $4,346 in favor of SCIG (Ducruet et al, 2011).  Gardulf et al (1995) also reported a reduction of  US$10,100 in cost per year  per patient  with SCIG use  in 
Sweden.  Similar cost savings were achieved in other countries as well (Lazzaro et al, 2014; Zbrozek, et al, 
2014).  Disadvantages of SCIG include more frequent infusions and local reactions at site s of infusion (transient 
swelling, soreness, redness, induration, local heat, and itching) in about 1% of patients.   
There are few reports of SCIG used in patients with CIDP ( Koller et al, 2006; Lee et al, 2008; Cocito et al, 
2011). The data from these reports are summarized in table 1.  In general, SCIG was well tolerated and had 
similar clinical effects as IVIG.   
Table 1 .Summary of reported use of SCIG in patients with CIDP.N/A = Data not reported; SE = side effects;  
 
More recently, Markvardsen and colleagues  (2013)  reported the  effect of SCIG in 30 CIDP patients 
characterized as IVIG -responders by their treating physicians  (see also abstract by Jacobsen et al, 2012) .  The 
patients were randomized to receive either SCIG at a concentration of 1.6g/10cc or subcutaneous saline in a 
double -blinded fashion. Treatment with SCIG was dem onstrated to be feasible, s afe, and associated with  
improved strength, walking performance, and disability scores. 
Despite the potential advantages in terms of cost and scheduling conveniences, there are inherent barriers to the 
transition from IV to SC routes of administration.  Fi rst, self -administrating a large volume into the 
subcutaneous space may be unappealing to patients.  Second, the limb weakness caused by the disease may make it difficult to prepare the solution,  operate the pump, and inserting the needles .  Third, many of  the 
patients are elderly and may need considerable assistance to properly administer the medication.  However, in Pt No Age Gender IVIG dose IVIG

these patients, these obstacles may be overcome with assistance from a caregiver or a visiting nurse .  In 
additions , the impact s on quality of life ( QOL ) have  not been fully assessed in this subset of patients . 
This study will survey the patients’ barriers to the transition from IV to the SC route of administration.  The 
results will form a basis for establishing a guideline for the us e of SCIG.  
SPECIFIC AIMS  
As of October 2012, we identified more than 70 patients with the diagnosis of CIDP  at the University of South 
Florida  (USF)  Neurology Clinic .  We estimated that at least 2/3 of these patients  meet the  Inflammatory 
Neuropat hy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) G roup diagnostic criteria  (Sander &  Latov, 2003) .  Many of these 
patients still attend our clinic and many are dependent on IVIG to control symptoms.  Data are lacking in terms of tolerability , although our physicians are often contacted by patients or infusion centers for guidance 
regarding treatment of Ig infusion related side effects such as hypertension, flu- like symptoms, headaches, and 
joint pain .   
Specific Aim #1 .This study will assess the QOL and  adverse events experienced by patients on IVIG and 
whether patients currently treated with IVIG would be willing to try the SC route of administration.  This 
specific aim will be achieved via telephone or face -to-face survey.   The goal is to identify  factors that may 
reduce the patients’ willingness to consider alternate drug delivery method . 
Specific Aim #2 . For patients willing to switch to SCIG, this study will test the hypothesis that SCIG is safe and 
well tolerated  and can be self -administered by patients with CIDP .  We will monitor patient s’ adverse reactions 
via patient diary, questionnaires , examination, and laboratory studies.   
Specific Aim # 3.  To test the hypothesi s that  SCIG is associated wi th better QOL , we will compare QOL 
measures  pre- and post -treatment . 
Specific Aim # 4.We will collect clinical data to test the hypothesis that SCIG is  efficacious i n controlling the 
symptoms of CIDP .  Patients  will be followed with hand- held dynamometry (HHD) and 20- ft timed walk.  Pre - 
and post -treatment s cores  will be compared using appropriate statistical analysis.  
RESEARCH STRATEGY 
SIGNIFICANCE:  
We have a substantial number of CIDP  patients who require frequent doses of IVIG.  Due to the side effects and 
time required by the IV route , these patients would potentially benefit from SCIG for the reasons discussed .  
The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether SCIG is well tolerated, can be self -administered, 
improves QOL , and is efficacious in controlling CIDP  symptoms .   
INNOVATION:  
Currently, most if not all CIDP patients who required Ig treatment are receiving it via the IV route.  If proven efficacious and better tolerated, SCIG would be an attractive alternative.  Additional benefits of SCIG include 
lesser cost and increased convenience to patients.   
APPRO ACH : 
This is a prospective, open label study of SCIG for the treatment of patients with CIDP  who are dependent on 
IVIG for control of symptoms . 
4 
 
 
Participants :  Up to 30 patients with IVIG -dependent CIDP  will be enrolled. To qualify, a patient must meet 
ALL  of the inclusion criteria and NONE  of the exclusion criteria.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
1) Confirmed diagnosis of CIDP (having 2 or more of the following):  
a) Weakness in any limb  
b) Motor fatigue significant enough to interfere with ADL’s or work  
c) Paresthesia of sufficient severity to require medication  
d) Sensory impairment  
e) Walking impairment 
2) Requires IVIG to control symptoms  
3) Male or female patient, older than 18 years of age  
4) Able to provide informed consent  
5) Able to be trained to provide self -injection  
6) Willing to be on birth control for the duration of the study (for women of reproductive potential)  
Exclusion C riteria:    
1) Thrombocytope nia or other bleeding disorders;  
2) Patients on a nticoagulation therapy with an INR > 3.5;   
3) Severe or anaphylactoid reactions to IVIG;   
4) Cancer  (active or currently treated );  
5) Pregnancy;  
6) Breast -feeding;   
7) Renal i nsufficiency (creatinine > 1.5 upper limit of normal) or failure;  
8) Congestive heart failure;   
9) Psychiatric illness  that would interfere with ability to provide informed consent or adhere to protocol ;  
10) Current IVIG dose s greater than 2 g/kg per month;   
11) Subject with an IgA level < 5% lower limit of normal;  
12) History of active infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C;  
13) Presence of any other medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with 
performance;  
14) Participation in a trial of an investigational medicinal product for CIDP in the past 12 weeks . 
 
Sample size and statistical analysis:  Descriptive  information for the rate of change, such as mean and standard 
deviation, will be calculated. Due to the small sample size and self -control used in this study, instead of using 
paired t -test, Wilcoxon paired  ranked test will be used to compare the change of before and after from each 
patient.  Significan ce level is defined as 0.05 and all of the analyses will be carried by SAS (version 9.2).  
DESIGN:  The study will be submitted to the USF IRB for approval.   
Specific Aim #1 . We will assess QOL  using the Medical Outcome Study 36- item short form health status scale 
(SF-36) and the Rasch -built Overall Disability Scale (R -ODS).  The scales have been validated in patients with 
CIDP (Merkies et al, 2002; van Nes et al, 2011).  We will also do a  survey of  side effects  and satisfaction with 
treatment (using the Treatment Satisfaction  Questionnaire for Medication, or TSQM ) and  CIP-PRO20 scale 
(used by permission from Dr. Ted Burns ; see appendix 3 ).  No surveys will be completed until the patient signs 
the ICF. In addition, we will determine  whether patients currently treated with IVIG would be willing to try the 
SC route of  administration .  Reasons cited for unwillingness to switch will be collected.   
5 
 
 
Specific Aim #2.To test the safety and tolerability of SCIG  and feasibility of self -administration  in patients with 
CIDP.  
Patients will undergo baseline laboratory studies (CBC, CMP, TSH, quantitative IgG, PT/INR/PTT, pregnancy 
test for women of productive age), EKG, QOL questionnaire s, treatment satisfaction and SE questionnaire s, 
neurological and physical examination, and HHD measurements.  
The study will provide all study medications, pumps, and supplies.  
The first treatment of SCIG will start within 2 week s after the last IVIG course (to maintain serum Ig levels ).  
The first 2 weekly treatments will be done at USF Clinical Research Center (USF CRC).  Patients will be 
trained to perform  their  own infusions during these initial sessions and will receive additional training sessions 
if needed. Subjects will start self -administration at ho me after they feel comfortable and confident with the 
procedure . For each weekly treatment, 20% solution of human normal IgG (Hizentra, CSL Behring AG) will be 
infused subcutaneously in the abdomen, flanks , arms, or thighs. Simultaneous  SC infusion at mult iple sites will 
be done using a multi -needle administration set.  The volume at each infusion site will be  35 ml ( 7 g) or as 
tolerated,  and administered via a syringe driver pump at a rate of 20 -25 ml/hr/site  or as tolerated .  For this study, 
we will use a 1:1 conversion ratio for IV to SC dosing.  The total SC dose weekly will be the patient’s current IVIG dose divided by 4 ( 0.25 g/kg – 0.5 g/kg, corresponding to 1 – 2 g/kg per month, which is usually our 
maintenance dose for C IDP patients ).  Patients requiring > 2 g/kg of IVIG per month will be excluded from 
study. Weekly doses may be divided over the course of the week if needed  (e.g., twice or three times a week ).  
The SCIG will be given weekly for 24 weeks .  The dosing will be individualized to each patient depending on 
dose and patient response.  The regimen  may be changed at any point as needed for patient comfort  (e.g., a 
patient may increase his/her  dosi ng schedule from 1 day to 2 or 3 days per week) . After this period, the patients 
will be given a choice to discontinue treatment, continue with SCIG, or go back to IVIG.  Pregnancy screen will be performed monthly on women with reproductive potential while they are undergoing treatment.  If a subject becomes  pregnant during the study, she will be withdrawn from treatment but will be monitored for the rest of 
the study.  Please see table 2 for schedule of study visits. Study subjects will be monitored for allergic reactions 
(rash, urticaria, facial edema, whee zing, dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia ) and injection site reactions 
(transient swelling, soreness, redness, induration, local heat, and itching) while receiving their first infusion at USF CRC.  They will also keep a treatment log  of injection site r eactions  for the duration of the study.  
Additional monitoring includes:  
1. CBC with differential count and platelet count will be done prior to treatment and once per month 
during treatment.  
2. Symptom monitoring will be done via phone and at scheduled visits a t regular intervals.  Study visits 
will have a window of +/ - 7 days.  Patients will have 24/7 access to investigators to report any 
symptoms that develop. 
3. Subjects will be provided with emergency contact number for questions relating to any symptoms during the study. 
4. In the event that the subject experiences a reaction at home, they will call us.   They will also be trained 
to call 911 in an emergency situation.  
Primary End -Points. 
1. Significant side -effect s requiring withdrawal from study. 
2. Laboratory abnormalities requiring discontinuation of study.

Specific Aim # 3.  To test the hypothesis SCIG is associated with better QOL .   
 
At baseline (pretreatment  of SCIG , while subjects are being treated with IVIG ), QOL and treatment satisfaction 
questionnaires ( SF-36, CIP -PRO20, R -ODS , and TSQM ) will be done .  These measures will be repeated 
monthly during the course of the  study.  Data from pretreatment and  treatment with SCIG  phase  will be 
compared using appropriate statistical methods with correction for multiple comparisons.   
Specific Aim # 4.  To test the hypothesis that SCIG is  efficacious  in controlling the symptoms of CIDP .   
Clinical response to SCIG will be monitored using HHD and 20- ft timed walk .  Data from pretreatment  and 
SCIG treatment phase will be compared.  The HHD will measure  force generated by the following muscle  
groups:  Shoul der flexion, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist extension, first dorsal interosseous (hand), hip 
flexion, knee extension, knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion.  Measurement will be done bilaterally in duplicates.  For the primary efficacy endpoint, HHD musc le strength measured at Week 24 will be compared to HHD 
muscle strength measured at baseline (pretreatment)

Study Timeline and Feasibility: Participants will be recruited from the USF N euromuscular Clinic. This C linic 
is the tertiary referral center for the west coast of Florida, with a population of more than 4 million in the Tampa 
Bay region a lone. We estimated that we have more than 70 patients with CIDP .  In addition, we see an average 
of 2 new CIDP patients per month.  Thus, there are enough patients for a 3 to 1 screening to enrollment ratio.  Planned recruitment is an average of 1 patient  every 1.5 months , for a total of 22.5 months. This schedule will 
place the final recruit completing the trial during month 30 and af ford time during the final 6 months of the 
study for analyzing and preparing data for publication. This planned recruitment timeline is feasible given the size, established referral patterns, and historical recruitment experience of this clinic.  
 Rescue p rotocol:  If a subject worsens  (or “relapses”)  during the study, we will institute a rescue protocol.  
Relapse is defined as a 20% decrease in force (as detected on HHD) in more than 50% of the muscles tested  
when compared to baseline. In case of relapse, we will quantify the serum Ig levels, give IVIG 1 g/kg boost 
followed by SCIG at 2 g/kg per month.  If the subject is already on 2 g/kg per month of SCIG, we will switch 
the patients back to IV administration and /or institute other trea tment options (steroids, PLEX).  Please see 
algorithm in Appendix 2. We will also switch back to IVIG  if, at any point during the study:  
a. The subject requests the switch due  to treatment  failure, adverse events or patient preference.  
b. The investigators consider  it to be in the best interest of the subject (i.e., due to intolerable 
side-effects, pregnancy, or noncompliance).  
Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies:  There  is the potential that some  patients may lose interest or 
become t oo reticent in performing self -administration . Since compl iance may be an issue with self -
administration of an injectable medication, serum IgG levels will be done to monitor patient’s adherence to protocol.  The use of a home journal for recording therapy and a weekly telephone call will encourage compliance. In the scenario where there is con cern with patient compliance, a  weekly home therapy visit  will be 
done . Attrition is also expected during the course of the study. If a participant becomes a ‘drop out ,’ his or he r 
data will be used in the analysis using an intention to treat protocol. Fin ally, while recruitment can be an issue in 
clinical trials, our planned enrollment rate of an average of 1  patient  per 1.5 months  is feasible.  Furthermore, 
we already identified several  patients who are appropriate for this trial.  With an average of 2 ne w CIDP  
patients seen per month in the USF Neuromuscular C linic, we should be  able to recruit the remaining  patients in 
the proposed timeline.  Furthermore, there are many more CIDP  patients in the greater Tampa region  who are 
not being seen at USF .  Thus, there is an untapped pool of subjects available.  In the unanticipated scenario that 
we fall behind on subject recruitment, we have incorporated 6 additional months in our timeline for analysis and 
manuscript preparat ion that could be utilized for subject recruitment and treatment .   
Data Management and Quality Control : Physiologic  and questionnaire  data will be collected across t wo time 
points (pre - and SCIG treatment phase ) by the PI and coordinator  who are all proficient in these testing 
methods. To ensure participant confidentiality, data will be coded to remove patient identifiers into a password-protected database (E xcel) on a central computer system that is backed up daily. Data accuracy will be verified 
by double data entry. All  original paper questionnaires will be locked in the PI’s office with only coded 
identifying information. There will be an inter im analysis done after 8 patients have completed the study. 
 
Safety Monitoring and Adverse Events Reporting:   Patients will be closely monitored for safety and any adverse 
events. This monitoring of treatment tolerability will be achieved through weekly telephone contact and monthly visit . During the study visits, s ubjects will be seen b y a member of the research staff  and will complete 
all study instruments, undergo clinical assessment , and have blood drawn for safety and compliance monitoring.  
At all study visits, concomitant medications, symptoms and side effects will be reviewed.  Pa rticipants will also 
be provided with the Study Agent Intake and Symptom log which they will be required to complete. Adverse 
8 
 
 
Events will be reported to sponsor , USF IRB and regulatory agency, by i nvestigator s in a timely manner as 
required . 
 
Dose  and Toxicity Management:   
A patient’s treatment will be suspended in any of the following circumstances:   
 
1. Allergic reaction to product  2. Request of patient or patient’s physician;  3. Unusual symptoms reported during telephone follow -up or other unusual symptoms or blood work results 
observed during the study period 4. Pregnancy; or  
5. Worsening symptoms requiring hospitalization or PLEX.   Any side effects  associated or possibly associated with SCIG  will be managed according to standard medical 
practice.

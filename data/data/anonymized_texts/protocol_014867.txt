5 1 BACKGROUND/SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
     The Research Problem – Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits among patients 
with diabetes mellitus  (DM) are key contributors to rising U.S. DM -related health care costs.1
  DM self -
management education (DSME) has been shown to reduce utilization of acute care servi ces. 
Traditionally considered a suboptimal environment in which to provide education, the hospital may 
actually provide a unique opportunity to educate patients with DM.  Recent studies suggest that 
inpatient DSME, improving communication of discharge instructions and involving patients in medication  (Rx) reconciliation may reduce risk for early readmissions
2, and improves outcomes .3,4,5 
The American Diabetes Association ( ADA)6 and The Joint Commission7 delineate educational content 
to communicate to all DM patients before hospital discharge.  
Inpatient delivery of DSME per national guidelines presents a challenge to hospitals .6,8,9 
Hospital -based DM specialists - endocrinol ogists and DM educators - cannot reach all patients who 
need DSME.  Methodology for delivery of learner -centered DSME to inpatients with DM at the 
bedside within existing workflow on nursing units is needed.  This study will deploy pre-
implementation assessment methods and designs coupled with established implementation effectiveness (IE)  evaluation frameworks to integrate delivery of DSME  sustainably into ongoing 
hospital nursing unit processes for patient education and discharge planning. Evidence 
generat ed by this study will be used to support a future application for NIH R18 funding.  
 
     Importance of the Problem –  Studies of patients hospitalized with poorly controlled DM report 
that readmissions occurred in < 30 days in 14%, < 180 in 32%,4 and that 17% w ere readmitted to the 
ED in < 30 days.10 Readmissions  can be partially attributed to deficits in DM knowledge and self -
management skills, including poor adherence to DM medications (Rxs) . Hospitals face challenges in 
delivering education to all DM patients as recommended in national guidelines.6,8.9 Hospital -based 
DM specialists – endocrinologists and DM educators - cannot reach all patients who need DSME. 
Survival skills education,  teaching topics essential for safe patient discharge, is recommended for 
inpat ient DSME4. Despite some success, patient factors including Rxs non- adherence remain a 
critical barrier to improved outcomes  even when education is provided. This suggests that a more 
holistic approach is required including personalized feedback to effecti vely integrate the patient into 
the chronic care continuum .11 Innovative providers are responding by implementing efforts to deliver 
DSME and discharge transition support to patients. Evidence -based sustainable tactics for 
offering learner -centered, knowledge- based DM education in hospitals to all patients with DM 
are needed.   
 
     Literature important to the study  – The data summarized in the following section directly 
support the need for interventions such as  Diabetes To Go.  
    The need for DM  education. DSME, part of the chronic care and health promotion models, 
improves knowledge, self -care behaviors including Rx adherence,
12 clinical indicators and health 
status and reduces healthcare utilization.4,7,13  Patients who receive inpatient DSME have a lower 
frequency of 30 -day readmi ts than those who do not (11 vs 16%; p=0.0001).7 DSME is usually 
delivered outpatient 1:1 or via classes , allow ing the patient to make informed decis ions regarding 
daily self -care, yet many patients do not return to compl ete the full curriculum, and readmitted 
patients have been shown to have dramatically low knowledge.2

   The need for strategies to support improvement in Rx adherence. Patients  are primarily 
responsible for safely and appropriately self -administering Rx regimens. 6 In a study of  patients 
surveyed at discharge, only 28% were able to list all their Rxs, with only 37%  being able to recount 
their purposes, and just 14% able to state their  common side effects .14 To gain the benefits of drug 
therapy while minimizing adverse drug events, patients must : have a functional knowledge o f Rxs 
and their proper dosaging;  consolida te the regimen to an efficient daily schedule;  problem -solve 
around regimen use as changes occur (e.g., sick days);  and continue the behaviors over time. 
Studies have shown that patients have problems performing these tasks. This need is particularly 
impor tant for those with DM, a complex chronic condition requiring long -term understanding of the 
timing, purpose, and side effects of multiple Rxs .15-19 Initiatives targeting improved knowledge of 
and adherence to Rxs prescribed at hospital discharge are needed .  
 
   The need for  discharge care transition support. Illuri,  Wallia,  et al conducted a DM-specific 
Failure Modes Effects and Analysis , a risk assessment method used in high reliability industries. The 
analys is revealed that patient variability in both D M Rxs and education comprehension is a high risk 
barrier to improved care in the transition from inpatient to outpatient care. Of  the 3 highest risk s 
identified in this analysis , two are directly relevant to the present proposal: 1) variability in patient 
comprehension of DSME and DM Rxs (including use, effects and reconciliation);  and 2) Rx discharge 
recommendation variability between providers9.  
 
   The need for methodology for hospital DSME delivery.  Few, if any, clinical trials in the DM field 
have uti lized robust pre- implementation assessment methods and designs coupled with established 
implementation effectiveness (IE)  evaluation frameworks to help inform and assess implementation 
practices. This project will help overcome these deficiencies by 1) applying the principles of implementation science (IS) and human factors (HF) engineering
9,20-25 and 2) utilizing mixed methods 
to design the intervention, workflow processes and plan the intervention to be sustainable within existing care delivery models. In formation technology  (IT) tools are increasingly  being  leveraged as a 
method to deliver content at the bedside and provide support for care transitions from hospital to home.
26 An IT platform for delivery of messaging content  is used in the hospital in thi s study.   
 
Prior experience and/or history relevant to the research -   
 
   This proposal seeks to build on our transdisciplinary  investigators’  prior work and examine 
ways to optimize D SME, skills training and discharge transition support integration within 
nursing unit workflow.  This planning grant, will  address concerns  of the  NIDDK Special Emphasis 
Panel on Pragmatic Research and Natural Experiments Reviewers  provided in response to a PAR 
13-366 R18 proposal submitted by our group (eRA Commons IR18D K108109- 01; Grant11851018; 
reviewed 05- 06-2015). Here, we will examine the feasibility of integrating a diabetes survival skills 
self-management education program  ( Diabetes To Go ) within nursing unit workflow, assess 
potential ‘burden’ on staff, align nur sing and patient time for intervention delivery, and assess nursing 
unit staff, hospital leadership and patient acceptance of the intervention.  
 
The study team , led by Dr. Michelle Magee, PI, reported pilot study results for Diabetes To Go  in 
which a learner -centered survival skills DSME program was o ffered to 125 hospitalized patients with 
uncontrolled type 2 DM (mean age 58+ 13 yrs; 66% female; 89% Black). While 70% had had  prior DM 
education, only about half reported education within 2 -5 years. Deficits identified on a pre- test 
(KNOW Diabetes) auto- directed the patient to video education content (view content examples at - 
http://vimeopro.com/sitelvideo/diabetes  - password diabetes). Study team r esearch assistants spent 
30-60 min in 5- 10 min time blocks per patient for intervention delivery. DM knowledge improved, with 

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
7 61% answering > 5 questions correctly at baseline and 89% at post -test ( P<0.0001). Odds of being 
recognized as highly adherent (Modified Morisky Rx Adherence 4- item Score©) were 1.28 times 
higher at 2 wks (p<0.0001) and 1.36 times higher at 3 month  post-discharge (p=0.0002) compared to 
baseline. Hospital and ED readmissions, although not powered sufficiently for statistical testing, 
showed encouraging results , with a decrease from 14% to 5% ( P=0.0588).4 The D iabetes To Go pilot 
showed the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of delivering DSM E at the bedside. T his content and 
delivery model will be optimized and further developed for provision of education in this  proposed pilot  
intervention .  
 
The MedStar t eam has extensive experience in focused DSME delivery in additional settings, 
including the ED and the community  which have also generat ed support for such an approach and 
which was used to inform  Diabetes To Go education content. The Synergy To Enable Control 
Program for Adults with type 2 DM study  generated evidence that ED visits made by adults with 
DM and hyperglycemia can be used to initiate a 4- wk intervention with titration of DM Rxs and 
survival skills DSME . Among 101 participants  (96% Black; 54% female; and 62.3% 
Medicaid/Medicare insurance) learner -centered survival skills DSME initiated in the ED  significant ly 
increased  knowledge and few  patients required meter and insulin shot instruction at follow -up, 
indicating skills retention. Modified Morisky  Rx adherence score© improved from low to medium  
(p<0.001),  a clinically meaningful improvement.27.28 The ABCs of Diabetes placed a  DSME progra m 
in a public library. Two small -group interactive DSME classes improved  DM knowledge. Significant 
clinical outcomes included reduction in self -reported ED visits and in mean A1C.5 These data support 
the contention that concise, focused DSME, as will be pr ovided in this study, can improve DM 
outcomes among high- risk adults with type 2 DM.   
 
MWHC  has an established DM resource nurse champion (DRNC) program . Nurses interested in 
developing DM expertise are provided 1 hour a month to attend continuing education meetings at 
which a DM topic is presented and DM -related issues arising on units discussed. This group 
participated as a Diabetes To Go Advisory Board for the purpose of this grant submission . The 
proposed program was overviewed and the DRNCs were given the opportunity to ask questions and to provide input and preliminary suggestions on program design, perceived strengths and weaknesses and identificati on of processes to enable program success . Two areas for consideration 
in program development  were identified. The first was in- /exclusion-  criteria: Will Spanish speaking , 
low literacy patients , Psychiatry inpatients and/or ED patients be included? The second area was 
program design: It was suggested that the technology platform generate a report of survey results for each patient so the staff nurse can see in which areas education should be focused; Concern was expressed that iPads would be taken if not t ethered and that attaching the iPad to a rolling pole would 
prevent theft; It was noted that it will be important to determine which patients are also  seen by the 
hospital diabetes educators as a confounding variable of study outcomes.  These 
observations/f indings were considered in the present study design. This DRNC group will participate 
in the Advisory group for the R34 study.  
 
In addition to the DM related research, the study team has significant experience in conducting 
pragmatic health services resear ch in telehealth, patient safety, 29-31 and quality health improvement 
for patients with cardiovascular disease32-38.  Dr Kelly Smith h as experience in mixed methods and 
ethnographic approaches to examining how to integrate programs and processes into existing hospital workflow. Specific experiences include integrating and optimizing cardiovascular surgical approaches to off -pump surgery
34, examining effectiveness of oxygenators39, and optimizing surgical 
care for elderly patients  .33,40 In her current AHRQ funded study called We Want to Know , Dr. Smith 
is partnering with hospital leadership and nursing staff to actively engage hospitalized patients to 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
8 report potential patient safety events. Detailed interviews, field observations, and focus groups with 
patients, providers, and leaders in 9 units have been conducted to establish a sustainable process for program integration into standard hospital processes prior to launching the program system -wide. We 
Want to Know  is included in the MedStar Health system FY16 annual operating plan. Another 
example of pragmatic work is Dr. Smith’s AHRQ funded contract to implement, evaluate, and spread 
a medical liability and communication resolution toolkit called CANDOR . This work is ongoing and 
has also been approved as part of the FY16 operating plan. Program education and training of system leadership and local hospital leaders has been completed. Processes have been established and are currently in field testing. System -wide launch began in July 2015 and will be implemented 
throughout all hospitals within M edStar Health by January 2016. These experiences will support 
successful completion of the Diabetes To Go R34 planning study .

9 Dr Mete worked with Drs Magee and Smith in the design of the present proposal and developed the 
statistical analysis plan which she will conduct when the study is completed.  
 David Brennan, MBE is MI2 Director of Telehealth. With an extensive background i n technology 
development, project management, applied health services research, and clinical program development, he will lead user -centered design tasks related to updating and refining the Diabetes To 
Go content and managing usability testing.   
2. OBJECT IVES  
We seek to determine the feasibility of integrating the Diabetes To Go program sustainably into ongoing hospital nursing unit processes for patient education and discharge planning. If successful, preliminary data generated will be used to develop a r andomized controlled trial 
which will further assess program outcomes, including clinical and economic measures and potential for widespread dissemination.  
 
The objectives of the present R34 Diabetes To Go Inpatient proposal  are to refine the Diabetes To 
Go program content based on user feedback and experience, as well as to design and develop 
processes to enhance the feasibility of integrated implementation within usual nursing unit workflow within a large health system. A mixed- methods approach is used to  leverage implementation science 
frameworks and human factors principles to make DM survival skills education and discharge support more accessible, interactive and engaging for patients. The long -term goal of this research
 is to 
optimize scalable and sust ainable solutions for DSME and for DM -related discharge support. This 
personalized approach leverages e- health technologies to pursue the following Specific Aims:  
  Aim 1: To refine and optimize the Diabetes To Go program  content and implementation 
processes.  
  
This will be achieved by applying user -centered interface design principles, content development in 
partnership with patients and providers, detailed process mapping for program integration into existing processes and workflow, and integrating  mobile and e- health technology to support care 
transitions. The Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model will guide implementation planning and evaluation.      
   Hypothesis 1.   Diabetes To Go : will be optimized for patient and provider  usability and integration 
into nursing  unit workflow; will enhance patient self -care knowledge and skills; and will support the 
discharge transition process.   
 
Aim 2 :  To conduct iterative  rapid- cycle  usability testing of the enhanced  Diabetes To Go 
progr am content and processes  and establish a Diabetes To Go program toolkit for 
widespread implementation.  
   This will be achieved by a series of intervention- evaluation cycles of field testing, refinement, retesting 
of the Diabetes To Go program and evaluati on through: direct observation; patient, provider and 
system leadership stakeholder interviews and focus groups; and evaluation of changes in early patient outcomes.  
    
   Hypothesis 2.   The Diabetes To Go program will be perceived favorably by stakehold ers yielding a 
high-quality toolkit for implementation and delivery of the program for further evaluation and testing.

Preliminary data gathered during this study will be used to design an R18 pragmatic trial in response 
to PAR 15 -157 which will examine outcomes of implementation of the Diabetes To Go program when 
delivered on hospital nursing units to adult patients with diabetes across hospital s and health 
system s. The model has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in sustainable and generalizable 
approaches for delivery of patient -centered education and medication adherence and discharge 
transition support in the hospital  
 
3 EXPECTED RISKS/BENEF ITS 
If successful, Diabetes to Go has the potential to benefit patients and the health care delivery 
systems within which they receive care by caus ing a paradigm shift in sustainable and generalizable 
approaches for  delivery of  patient -centered education and discharge tr ansition support . We expect 
that enhanced delivery of education, targeted to the patient’s individual learning needs, will lead to 
enhanced understanding of the need for and adherence to medications to control their diabetes and other comorbid conditions.  Preliminary data gathered during this study will be used to desig n an R18 
pragmatic trial in response to PAR 15- 157 which will examine outcomes of implementation of the 
Diabetes To Go program when delivered on hospital nursing units to adult patients with diabetes across hospital s and health system s. In the future the l earnings from this study may benefit nursing 
staff, hospitals  and patients. Nursing unit staff and hospitals may benefit from the system developed if 
it is effectively  integrated into workflow processes and discharge care to support delivery of DSME at 
the bedside with minimal disruption of unit workflow. Benefits to patients in terms of knowledge 
conveyed and potential clinical impact of the Diabetes To Go Inpatient intervention will be determined in future studies.  
 We believe that t his study will expose nursing unit staff and patients to “Minimal risk ”.  The probability 
and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in this  research are not greater in and of themselves 
than those ordinarily encountered in daily  nursing unit  life or during the performance of routine 
physical or psychological examinations or tests.  No blood is being drawn.  All staff and patient level data, including  focus group, 1:1 interview and satisfaction data, as well as technology usage and 
usability d ata will be de -identified.  For staff and patient interviews, we will be seeking a waiver of 
documentation of informed consent as the only document linking the individual to the study outcomes would be the consent document itself. All data will be coded and de-identified. Data will also be 
presented only in aggregate form, further limiting the risks of loss of confidentiality and breach of privacy .  
   
4.  ELIGIBILITY  
Study population & sources - 
The participants will vary based upon the phase of the study .  
 
Phase 1. Workflow Assessment and Processes Intervention Design  
• A purposive sample of 10 -14 nurses and patient care technicians (PCTs)  on 4 non-critical care 
adult medicine nursing units, including 1 psychiatry unit  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
11 • A group of 4 patient end- users  will be engaged in usability testing. In addition to the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined below under Phase 2 that represent the target audience for the Diabetes To 
Go platform, the following additional criteria for inclusion will also be used:  
o Speak, read, write English 
o Inpatient admission to  a MedStar hospital within the prior 12- 18 months  
o Experience with the Diabetes To Go program and/or DSME  
 
Phase 2.   Pilot intervention.   
• All unit staff will participate in the education delivery program  which will be introduced as a unit 
Quality Improvement initiative.   
• Staff may opt- out of participation in the interview activities without consequences.  
• ALL patients on the 4 units who have a diagnosis of  DM will be offered the program  to 
minimize workflow disruption and enhance operational sustainability .  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria  – These criteria have intentionally been kept broad to minimize 
disruption to unit workflow and to increase generalizability  of findings.  Where appropriate, the 
justification for each criteria is also presented, eg exclusion of minors.  
    Inclusion Criteria --Age > 18 yrs (lower limit of age for admission to MWHC adult units ; all of the 
Diabetes To Go content is designed for adult learners ); English speaking  (Diabetes To Go content is 
currently only available in English) ; a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (ICD9 250.xx/ICD -10-CM E08 -
E11)  documented in the EMR ; admitted to one of the inpatient units (non- critical care adult medicine 
nursing units, including 1 psychiatry unit)  where the study is being conducted ; willing and able to 
participate in the program.   
    Exclusion criteria : Age < 18 years (MWHC does not admit minors to its Medicine units and 
Diabetes To Go content has been prepared for adult learners); Pregnancy or anticipated conception within 3 mos  (Diabetes To Go content does not address gestational diabetes or diabetes in 
pregnancy where management and glycemic targets differ considerably from those for non- pregnant 
adults ) ; admission to an intensive- care unit, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state  
– conditions in which the acuity level would likely preclude participation in DSME;  patient declines 
participation in the education program for any reason; and any medical condition or cognitiv e 
dysfunction that, in the opinion of unit staff, would preclude participation in the education program.  
5 SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Phase 1. Workflow  Assessment and Processes Intervention Design.  
 Drs. Magee, McCartney and Smith will present the Diabetes To Go research project at a nursing 
leadership meeting. Dr. McCartney  and Dr. Smith will work with unit nursing leaders to identify 
individuals who may serve as key informants . They will request permission to present the Phase 1 
study objectives to the frontline nurses during standing team meetings and/or during team huddles on 
the unit. A recruitment flyer with information about the study and about how to participate in the platform usability testing will be made available to each nurse and nurse manager. Indivi duals who 
agree to participate as key informants will go through the informed consent process at the time of the usability testing and be given an information sheet for their records. A waiver of documentation of informed consent will be applied for as it will be the only document linking the staff member to the project outcomes.  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
12 Dr. McCartney  and Dr. Smith will work with the nursing leaders to identify optimal dates/times to 
observe current rounding practices for diabetes education in order to map process es for the pilot 
intervention. Individuals (nurses, patient care technicians, and diabet es educators) will be shadowed 
by one of the project coordinators/human factors specialists. Identification of the individual shadowed 
will be withheld from documentati on and the output of the process mapping and field observations will 
be presented in aggregate as flow diagrams and thematic representations of current and optimal workflow.  
 Phase 2.   Pilot Intervention  
 A Diabetes To Go Inpatient Program informed consent will be provided to each patient admitted to the participating  units who has a DM diagnosis .   
 The study team will inform the DRNC (or alternate designated staff member)  via an ongoing 
electronic  screening  list of unit patients who have D M.  All DM patients admitted to the unit will be 
considered for  program  participation  by unit staf f.  Staff will assess ability to participate in the program 
(see Patient Screening Checklist)  and if appropriate will offer each patient  the program.  At the time 
the program is offered to each patient, nursing unit staff will answer any questions that the patient may have about Diabetes To Go. Patients who agree to participate will then be asked to provide 
informed consent and when they have done so, w ill be enrolled in the program.  
 Reasons for exclusion from the offering  (screen failures)  will be recorded in the study database by the 
study team from the screening checklists . Patients who decline participation in the program will be 
also be considered as screen failures.  The reason(s) for declining participation will be captured.  
6 STUDY DESIGN AND PRO CEDURES

The Diabetes To Go conceptual model is shown in Figure 2. Individualized l earner -centered 
education address es patient’s DM self-care 
management knowledge and skills deficits  
and discharge transition support. Knowledg e 
of DM medications (Rxs)  prescribed at 
hospital discharge, access to those 
medications and communication with the Primary Care Provider (PCP) to assure continuity of care will be emphasized. If successful, preliminary evidence generated by this R34 will s erve to inform the design, 
methods and measures to support a full scale pragmatic trial ( PAR- 15-157). This 
prospective pilot study will examine strategies to optimize an inpatient DSME, skill building and technology -assisted 
discharge care transition prog ram 
delivered at the bedside by existing staff 
on nursing units. Intervention design will be informed by mixed methods using human factors  
principles and implementation science  approaches to optimize unit integrati on.   
 
Phase 1 Project –  Design Diabetes T o Go Program & Processes  
 Aim 1: To refine and optimize the Diabetes To Go program content and implementation 
processes. This will be achieved by applying user -centered interface design principles, content 
development in partnership with patients and providers, detailed process mapping for program integration into existing processes and workflow, and integrating mobile and  e-health technology to 
support care transitions. The PRISM will guide stakeholder engagement, implementation planning and evaluation. Hypothesis 1 - The Diabetes To Go  program: will be optimized for patient and 
provider usability and integration into nursi ng unit workflow ; will enhance patient self -care knowledge 
and skills; and will support the discharge transition process.   
 
E1a. Baseline Workflow and Initial PRISM Elements Assessment. The MHRI Implementation 
Science team will collaborate  with the MedStar  Diabetes Institute (MDI) clinical research team and 
MWHC Nursing  to perform an ethnographic study  examining workflow  of identified staff engaged in 
DSME and discharge planning  to develop a process map for integrating Diabetes To Go into day -to-
day practic e. A purposive sample of nurses and patient care technicians ( PCTs ) (n=10 -14) will be 
observed  for 6- or 10-hr blocks on 4 non-critical care adult medicine nursing units, including 1 Diabetes To Go Conceptual Model

other observational studies of nursing care.41, 42 The time blocks were chosen to avoid shift turnovers, 
when no education will be taking place and will be varied s o that all days of the week and  
shifts will be covered. Semi -structured interviews with 
 nurses and PCTs will be conducted to solicit perceptions 
of how intervention integration could be optimized. 
Participatory action met hods will be employed to 
iteratively identify common themes and validate the themes and process maps that are developed with relevant nursing staff and leaders and hospital leadership.
43-49  
   Participatory action research is an iterative process that seeks to understand and improve the problem and reduce deficiencies through involving the recipients (stakeholders) of the intervention in the process of development who, in turn, take actions to improve the system . Figure 3 depicts  the 
iterative cycle of dat a collection, information synthesis 
and analysis, feedback and refining of assumptions, synthesis and prioritization, and output validation, prioritization and group consensus. The pr ocess 
continues until researchers and stakeholders comes to consensus.  This is a rapid process, quickly 
moving from base knowledge to group consensus.  It can also be used iteratively. Field observations 
will be recorded and time- stamped to document and code each staff task performed and time spent 
on the task in the patient room. Data on key characteristics of each task will be collected, such as whether the task is an interaction with the patient that is cognitive or physical or both, is required or optional, and whether the task is interrupted.  Descriptive statistics w ill be calculated to determine the 
total staff time spent in the room, and the nature and duration of the tasks performed there . Initial key 
informant interviews  will be conducted 1:1 with patients, with physician providers (inpatient and 
primary care providers ) and with nursing  and hospital  leadership. Initial PRISM elements will be 
assessed .Dr. Smith and her team have experience in applying these methods in support of hospital 
practice transformation.  
   User -Centered Development and Usability Testing of the T ablet -Based Learning Platform . 
The MedStar Institute for Innovation (MI2) team, under the direction of Dave Brennan, MBE, will plan and carry out the user -centered design of two additional Diabetes To Go modules.  How to Talk to 
Your Doctor ( adapted from t he AHRQ, NIH Office of Research in Minority Health endorsed Baylor 
College of Medicine “How to Talk to Your Doctor” (and get your doctor to talk to you!) program  
content 
50.) will focus on strategies  for enhancing patient -provider -communication and generat e take-
home printed handouts patients can use during  post-discharge PCP visits to generate discussions 
around DM targets and the importance of appropriate medication choices. The DM -related skills 
management module  will guide patients through insulin (vial and syringe or pen) and GLP -1 analog 
shot self -administration instructions and through the technique of performing fingerstick self -blood 
glucose monitoring.  Each module will consist of a mix of content format an d type (images, videos, 
animation  –eg for role modeling for patient -provider communication-  and text) developed in -house or 
from external industry partners. MedStar’s e- Visit platform  will also be integrated into the post -
discharge support process for pati ent and provider use and its’ uptake/adoption assessed.  
     A user -centered design approach will be employed during development of both the new modules 
as well as revisions to the entire tablet -based learning platform, which will be built using MedStar 
Health’s existing patient engagement and data collection engine, Tonic Health

15 (http://medicalhumanfactors.net/ ) will provide heuristic review of initial designs and conduct 3 
sequences of rapid- cycle usability testing, each with 4 patient end- users (a sample size which has 
been cited as being adequate to identify 80% of usability problems with a system51). Results from 
each cycle w ill be used to drive iterative improvements in design and to study the program  processes . 
During usability testing, participants will be asked to complete an entire education  session from 
registration through follow -up survey.  To support the Research Data Collection  needs of the study, 
the MI2 Team will code the required data collection instruments in the REDCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) web-based research data system .51 MedStar is a partner in the REDCap 
Consortium and this study will leverage an existing operational best practices for secure data 
access/storage and system -wide training.  
    
Implementation Design/Planning  
 
Implementation design and the pilot protocol  will be  informed by the workflow assessment and 
initial PRISM elements evaluation;  Analysis of observational and key informant interview data, 
and resource nurse focus group data  will provide insight into implementation barriers  and 
strategies to overcome them  to assure integration of the intervention with minimal workflow 
impact.  PRISM  will enhance the translation of research into practice52 by guiding Phase 1 
implementation planning and Phase 2 evaluation in support of Specific Aim 1  – Optimization of 
intervention design. The PRISM elements addressed during planning and throughout the trial are 
shown on Table 2.  
   Phase I activities aim to identify barriers and facilitators of intervention success across 
organizational, patient, and environmental (internal and external) stakeholders. Representatives from each group will be interviewed (semi -structured interviews/focus group). Data on barriers and 
facilitators will be validated with the  
stakeholder s using a participatory action methods approach. Phase 2 approaches are detailed i n the 
Implementation Effectiveness Evaluation section below.  
  Early identification and evaluation of barriers  and facilitators of implementation will allow for creative 
solutions to be embedded into the study protocol prior to clinical implementation, thu s, creating an 
innovative, sustainable program for patients and clinical stakeholders.

  Phase 2 Project – Iterative Pilot Testing  
 Aim 2 :  To conduct iterative  rapid- cycle  usability testing of the enhanced  Diabetes To Go 
program content and processes  and establish a Diabetes To Go program toolkit for 
widespread implementation.  
  This will be achieved by a series of intervention- evaluation cycles of field testing, refinement , 
retesting of the Diabetes To Go program and evaluation through direct observation, stakeholder (patient, provider, system leadership) interviews and focus groups, and evaluation of changes in early patient outcomes. This will enable demonstration of uptake and adoption of the program by unit staff and by patients. Hypothesis 2 - Diabetes To Go will be perceived favorably by patients, providers, 
and health system leaders yielding a high- quality toolkit for implementation and delivery of the 
program for furt her evaluation and testing.    
  
Pilot Implementation ( 9 months ). Phase 2 activities will enable accomplishment of Specific Aim 2.  
Diabetes To Go  will be piloted in 4 units  as a Quality I mprovement initiat ive. All methods described 
in this section are subject to revision per baseline workflow and PRISM assessments and the optimized study design developed by the team based on those findings.  The program will be offered 
by staff to ALL  patients on the unit with DM to minimize workflow disruption and enhance operational 
sustainability . A series of iterative implement -observe- refine cycles will be conducted during the 
Phase 2 to assess process, workflow and patient receptivity to the program.  This will provide opportunities to make rapid- cycle improvements.   Details of the pilot study work plan are provided 
below.

General Methods.  
  Baseline Assessment: All participants on intervention units  will undergo baseline assessment as 
shown in Table 4.  After unit staff have provided the patient with program information about the 
program, the study team will obtain baseline data as shown on Table 4. Because this pilot study, by 
design, is not assessing lab clinical outcomes the study will not be conducting any study -provided 
laboratory tests.  
  Patient outcomes surveys.  The KNOW Diabetes knowledge survey  and the Modified Morisky53 Rx 
Adherence Survey 8- item (MMAS -8© with permission from D. Morisky ) are delivered via the Tonic 
platform. Delivery oversight will be provided by the unit staff.  The KNOW Diabetes survey was 
developed by MedStar for use with  the STEP -DM and Diabetes To Go programs. Each knowle dge 
question is linked to video content so that education address es knowledge deficits directly via the 
platform  when an incorrect response is entered.  
  Evaluation of Implementation Costs . Pre liminary costs for program implementation will be 
collected by the study team and will include unit clinical staff effort /time  accrued in program delivery 
and costs for technology , for licenses  and for printed nurse and patient education tools.  
  Staff training.  The DRNC will train  staff via cha nge of shift in -services. Each staff member will also 
take the knowledge pre- test, view the program education content and take the post -test. A web -based 
training module will be available so that staff may also complete the training  online. A pocket version 
(print & tablet/smartphone app) of the education content will be provided. A CDE  member of the study 
team will serve as the unit program liaison/champion.  Unit in -services will address 1)  Evidence-
including research, clinical & patient experience, local data/information; 2)  Context -setting in which 
proposed change will be implemented; culture -how things are done at the site, values, beliefs, 
assumptions; leadership; evaluation,  effectiveness  3) Facilitation - including purpose, role and 
description of skills and attributes.

   The study team will inform the DRNC (or alternate designated staff member)  via an ongoing 
electronic list of unit patients who have DM.  S taff will  assess ability to participate and if appropriate 
will offer them the program. T raining in use of the technology until the patient feels comfortable with it  
will be provided. It is likely  that most patients will use the tablet to complete surveys  and access 
education content. The option to take the surveys on paper and to read the education cont ent in the 
Diabetes To Go book will be available should a patient prefer  the p rint modality. Using the methods 
agreed upon during the design phase, staff will encourage patients to progress through the program  
and provide an opportunity to ask questions when in the room.   
   Individualized education assignments  are driven by the pre- test knowledge assessment s. The 
patient takes the knowledge and MMAS -8 pre-tests via the Tonic platform . After the patient responds 
to each question, the program lets him/her know if the response was correct or not and gives the correct response as a first  teaching point.  At pre-test completion, the platform auto- directs the patient 
to each module corresponding to the areas in which a knowledge deficit existed . The unit staff 
member will be provided with a report card detailing the survey questions where deficits were identified so they can focus on these areas for subsequent education with the patient. Mandatory modules include those on each DM Rx  which will be  prescribed at discharge (including insulin or 
GLP-1 analog inject ion technique),  when to call the doctor  or go to the ED , and Talk To Your Doctor . 
DSME includes 7 core areas ; 5 of these will be tailored for each  patient based o n knowledge deficits 
identified by the KNOW Diabetes survey : 1) know your DM  numbers (sugar and A1C ), 2) know when 
your blood sugar is low , 3) know when your blood sugar is high,  4) basic diet education,  5) self -
monitoring of BG. Rx adherence issues identified on the MMAS -8 will also be addressed. DSME will 
be delivered via brief video clips (3- 5 minutes in length) via the tablet . When assigned content has 
been completed, the patient will take the post -test surveys . Each patient will be given a Diabetes To 
Go book with the same content  delivered on the videos to use as a reference following discharge.     
   Discharge DM Rxs management  and Arrangement for follow -up ‘virtual’ visits . Prior to 
discharge, unit staff will review the DM Rxs prescribed with the patient and flag the matching content 
in the Diabetes To Go book. Access to the Rxs will  be assessed  via the tablet /internet ( http://drg -
fingertipformulary. com/ ) and/or the hospital EMR formulary database. If Rx access is an issue,  staff 
will consult the provider writing the discharge Rxs to reconcile.  When possible, a 30d supply of any

Pilot 3 Rxs newly prescribed or in need of resupply will be delivered to the bedside prior to discharge  by the 
MWHC Pharmacy “Meds to Beds”  program to facilitate access.  Staff will let  patient s know that they 
will be called 2- 5 days post -discharge and will ask for preferred contact information and the best time 
to call/text/videochat.  We anticipate aligning these processes with current unit discharge medication 
management processes in order to minimize disruption to workflow.  
    Rapid cycle redesign and redeploymen t.  During the 
pilot, 2 -3 implement -observation- revision cycles for the 
program and process will be conducted (Figure 5 ). The  
approach to observations and refinement are detailed in section 1a- c. Each iteration will take approximatel y 2-3 
mos to complete. The final Diabetes To Go T oolkit 
deliverable  will be refined and revised based on user 
feedback at the end of the 3rd pilot. Stakeholders will be interviewed for user experience feedback. Process will be directly observed for >
 3 day s on each unit/iteration to collect implementation process information 
and feedback. Recruitment and retention approaches  are detailed in table 5 below.  
 
Table 5.  Recruitment and Retention Strategies  
Subject  Description  
Unit Staff  The main key to unit staff retention will be design optimization so it does not negatively affect workflow. 
Engaging unit staff and Nursing Leadership in study design will enhance program engagement. Staff will 
be invited to provide feedback to the study t eam during the intervention phase so that issues may be 
addressed. DRNCs will be enabled to have a specialized expertise in DM that will support nursing ladder 
advancement. Light food and beverages will be offered during staff advisory group meetings, duri ng in-
services and during training to help minimize time spent off the units/ non- productive time.  
Patients  A stipend in the form of gift cards will be offered to each patient completing  the program after the  the 30 
day follow -up visit to promote retention as described in the budget justification section. Follow -up virtual 
visits will be arranged at the patient’s convenience, including early AM, late PM and weekends to minimize 
disruption to usual daily activi ties, including work schedules.  
 
 
   Strategies for sustainability  outside the study setting.  Unit nurses previously provided input into 
the existing program education content and delivery format.  The intervention will be further developed 
by a multi -disciplinary team with strong representation from  nursing unit staff and l eadership, 
research and education stakeholders . It will be delivered by existing staff. Our intent is to show  that 
the program model could be implemented on  non-critical care hospital units by existing staff. The 
MedStar Institute for Quality and Safety has  strong  experience in quality, efficiency, reliability, and 
safety improvement, including  workflow process implementation (see Investigators and Facilities 
sections),  and will conduct  this study’s  workflow process analysis to assure efficient, effective  
program implementation. MedStar implementation scientists will employ the PRISM framework to 
optimize likelihood of implementation success and enhance generalizability. T he resulting program 
could potentially  be incorporated into the education delivery paradigm for all hospitals . Developing 
systems to understand individualized operability, and then using existing personnel and current scope s of practice  for education delivery will  be eff icient in terms of resources utilization  and broad 
applicability . Additionally, offering DRNCs the opportunity to develop expertise in diabetes is aligned 
with professional development and supervisor and peer recognition of the expertise gained.  
    Potent ial for generalizability . Our study’s inpatient medical  and surgical  environment reflect s the general 
U.S. hospital population, in that  up to 30% of inpatients have DM and standardized strategies and tools to 
educate patients are lacking. If successful in a subsequent RCT, the D iabetes To Go learner -centered, 
technology assisted model could potentially be applied in other clinical settings  (e.g., the Medical Home  and/or Figure 5 
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
21 on other inpatient services ) to bring DM  subspeci alty education directly to high volumes of patients who often 
do not access formal outpatient DM  education programs. This model could also be applied to other chronic 
complex medical conditions  in in- and outpatient settings to deliver education and thus i mprove outcomes.  
 
 
    Implementation Cost Analysis.  Professional labor and other personnel time will be determined 
using time -motion analysis supplemented by provider/staff interview. Unit labor costs will be 
determined from hourly wage or annual  salary  data as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
Capital costs for technology (hardware, software) and education tools (printed books and pocket 
guides) will also be determined.  
 
F.  Environment . The MWHC hospital  environment and the spectrum of support for conduct of 
clinical research offered by MHRI will aid in the success of th is study . The transdisciplinary clinical 
and scientific environment detailed in the Investigators and Facilities sections  will contribute to 
successfu l conduct of the study. Institutional support from Hospital Leadership, MHRI, and MedStar 
Health’s Chief Medical Officer ( see letters of support ) will assure successful implementation and 
sustainability of the proposed delivery model.  
 G.  Limitations/Pitf alls 
 Our study has potential limitations. Most notably, as described by the NIH Reviewers of our R18 proposal is that it may not be possible to fit the proposed intervention into unit workflow. Every effort is being made in our study design to avoid this pitfall; however, the following situations may arise which could impact outcomes:   
   Nursing unit staff have many competing demands on their time. The intervention will not work if the staff do not support it. Incorporating HF/IE principles and early nursing leadership and staff engagement in the process design will provide an opportunity to avoid this challenge via  thorough 
baseline assessment and ongoing IE.  In the event that the intervention does not succeed, a fallback 
plan will be examination of the potential for deployment of staff dedicated to patient education program delivery that is deployed across units.  
   Many factors contribute to poorly controlled DM and to readmissions. We will examine a few key variables —DSME  and skills education, their delivery at the bedside and strategies to enhance 
medication management during the discharge process.  Our intention is to address these high risk  
factors in our study in a focused concise way in order to assure delivery of key DSME and skills content and to support Rxs management and to engage the patient in healthy self -care behaviors 
which will promote outcomes improvement. We will identify additional  variables affect ing outcomes 
and address them as appropriate in this or future interventions.  
   Our post-discharge assessment period is 30 days, due to the short (2 yr) duration of this study . This 
time period will allow us to generate sufficient preliminary data for assessment we propose for this intervention. It will not however, permit determination of intermediate or l ong-term outcomes. These 
would be the focus of a future RCT if our prelim inary data shows promise.   Evaluation to determine 
long-term impact is beyond the scope of the present study and could be addressed in a future study.   
 Additional Information.  
 The Behavioral Intervention  
 
“Diabetes To Go”  is a learner -centered behavioral self -mangement education and medication 
adherence intervention that has been developed by a multidisciplinary team led by the present 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
22 proposal’s PI (Magee). It has also been pilot tested. The Diabetes To Go intervention and findings of 
the pilot study which assessed its preliminary impact on diabetes knowledge and medication 
adherence are described in the Section above on “ Prior experience and/or history relevant to the 
research ”.  
 
During Phase 1  of this study, we will r efine and optimize /adapt  the Diabetes To Go program  
content and implementation processes to enhance the likelihood of optimal uptake and impact of 
the behavioral intervention.   This will be achieved by applying user -centered interface design 
principles with our human factors part ners, development of additional content in partnership with 
patients, providers and MDI and MI2 content development experts, detailed process mapping for 
program integration into existing processes and workflow, and integrating mobile and e- health 
technology to support care transitions. The Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model, deployed by our implementation science experts will guide implementation planning and evaluation. Audio recordings  obtained during focus groups will be immediat ely transcribed following 
the interview. Transcripts will be reviewed and validated for accuracy. Once accuracy of the transcripts has been validated, the original audio recordings will be destroyed.    
 
The Diabetes To Go program  (surveys and video content ) will then be deployed in Phase 2  of the 
present study as an integrated teaching tool at the bedside to enable assessment of the effectiveness  
and short -term sustainability  of the workflow processes developed in Phase 1 of the study.  We will 
be gather ing pilot behavioral intervention patient outcomes related to knowledge and skills 
acquisition, Rx adherence, healthcare resources utilization, platform adoption, and satisfaction with the program .  
 Fidelity and competence  of the behavioral intervention will be maintained and demonstrated 
throughout  the study  as described below.  
 Fidelity  of the intervention process will be assured by reviewing to ensure that each education  
content area is consistently offered to each patient. Nursing Unit staff will encourage each patient to complete the program content during the time that they are on the unit prior to discharge. Reasons for failure to complete the full program will be capt ured from the patient and the unit staff ’s perspective in 
the program platform prior to or at the time of discharge from the unit .  The study coordinator will 
conduct audits to assess the degree of compliance with the program. Data for survey completion, 
survey results and video content usage will be auto- extracted from the Tonic for Health platform for 
provision to the data management team and will also be used in the assessment of fidelity.  
 Competence or compliance with fidelity  will be demonstrated  via analysis of the number of content 
areas accessed by each patient , time spent viewing video content which corresponds to knowledge 
deficits on the surveys and time spent viewing mandatory video content.  
 Focus Group Specifications.  
 
  Dr. Smith and her team  have extensive experience in conducting interviews and focus groups for the 
purpose of developing and designing sustainable solutions for implementation within hospital in-
patient settings. These experiences include focus groups for patients with chronic disease (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity), frontline staff (nurses, patient care technicians, transporters, administration), physicians, and senior hospital and healthcare leaders (board members, chief executives, middle management). In her current work on the We Want to Know project, Dr. Smith employs multiple interview methods include participatory action, cognitive interviewing, motivational 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
23 interviewing and focus groups to interview patients and family members about perceived breakdowns 
in car e as well as healthcare staff and leaders about their experience with the We Want to Know 
program implementation and sustainability of the program after grant funding.    
  A comprehensive interview guide will be created during the development phase of the Diabetes To 
Go project and submitted to the IRB prior to initiating any interviews or focus groups.  Focus groups will be conducted using a semi -structured interview approach, with questions on usability of the 
technological platform, content of the Diabetes To Go program, and identification of any perceived 
challenges or barriers to implementation.  
  Focus groups will be limited to English speaking patients and participants. For patient focus groups, we will work to ensure that all patient focus group gui des are written in plain language at no higher 
than a 6
th grade level.   
  Information will be captured during the interviews/focus groups in two ways. First, the members of the focus groups will be asked to provide verbal consent to be audio recorded for the purpose of the project. Second, in addition to the Focus Group Facilitator, a note take for  the project will be in attendance to take notes and assist the facilitator with ensuring attention to all the key components of the interview. Information from  the focus groups will be reviewed, synthesized, and aggregated using 
standard approaches for thematic review using grounded theory. Transcripts of the focus groups will be reviewed independently by two investigators for common themes. Adjudication of diff erences will 
be presented to a third investigator for validation and resolution. Once the common themes have been identified, this information will be presented back to the participants for validation and revision. Once validated, a final report on the out comes of the focus groups will be generated and the 
information gained from the participants will be used to revise the Diabetes To Go platform, educational content, and expected processes as appropriate.  Digital audio recordings of the focus 
groups will b e destroyed upon completion of validation of the written transcripts.  
  Permission to audio record participants will be included in the informed consent process and assented to verbally. Recording of the verbal assent will be conducted after initial agreement to be 
recorded. Information of the need to audio record the focus groups will also be a part of all recruitment materials so that any volunteer is aware of the need to record responses prior to their attendance at the focus group.  
 
Methodology Specific to S tudy S urvey s  
 
Phase 1.  
 
All information  for Phase 1 will be collected using semi -structured interviews and/or focus groups. 
Approaches to these activities  are presented above.  
 
Phase 2.  Pilot Intervention  
 
Survey methodology  – all surveys (baseline data, knowledge survey and medication adherence, 
satisfaction) will be self -administered via the Tonic for Health platform.  Patients will be provided 
instruction in use of the platform until they feel comfortable using it and in an ongoing fashion if needed during the participation period.  Patients who prefer not to use the technology platform will be provided with print copies of the surveys and if needed, eg the patient cannot read, then the surveys will be administered by the study team (baseline data and satisfaction) and the nursing unit staff (knowledge and medication adherence).  Staff will be trained in methods for administration of surveys 
so that bias in patient responses will not be introduced as a variable.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
24   As described in the approach sections above, two surveys are embedded in the Diabetes To Go 
program.  The first is the KNOW Diabetes survey . This tool was developed by the MedStar Diabetes 
Institute in recognition of the fact that there is no existing vali dated diabetes knowledge survey which 
specifically addresses diabetes “survival skills” self -manag ement education content areas. This 
survey is used as the pre-  post-knowledge survey in this study.  Importantly, responses to the survey 
determine which video content area patients will be directed to for viewing.  When a patient answers a question incorrectly, the platform provides a link to the video content which provides information on the topic for which a knowledge deficit was identified; thus, the content is tailored to the patient’s learning needs. In an ongoing study, t he MDI is currently in the process of vali dating the KNOW 
Diabetes survey.   
 
  The second survey  is the Modified Morisky Medication Adherence Survey, 8- item. This is a 
validated survey which is used with permission from David Morisky.  
 
  In addition to these surveys, a baseline survey will be administered to each patient participating in 
the program to gather data which will be used to augment data extracted from the hospital EMR  (See 
Baseline patient data survey) .  A patient satisfaction survey will also be administered at the time the 
patient completes the education program . This survey will address patient perceptions of the inpatient 
education experience and with the technolog y platform. These surveys will be developed during 
Phase 1 and submitted to the IRB for approval prior to use in Phase 2.   
 Other  Consideration Relative to Study Specifications:  
 
• Specimen Collection – No biological specimens will be collected in this stu dy. 
•    Studies involving use of product (licensed, labeled of small size, simple)  – No product  
will be used in this study.  
 
7 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE S 
The source document  will contain the original signed informed consent document, completed 
baseline data collection forms, and copies of all survey responses and will be kept in a locked cabinet on the MDI study team unit.  
 
Consented, participants will undergo baseline asses sment as shown in  Table 4.  The study team  will 
obtain all study -specified baseline data from the patient and/or from the EMR, with the exception of 
the knowledge and medication adherence survey responses.  
 
The education program -specific KNOW Diabetes knowl edge survey  and the Modified Morisky53 Rx 
Adherence Survey 8- item (MMAS -8© with  permission from D. Morisky ) are delivered by the nursing 
unit team  via the Tonic platform. As part of the education program, nursing unit staff delivering the 
program to an individual patient will have access to his/her survey responses in order to enable tailoring education at the bedside to identified knowledge deficits and medication adherence issues .  
 
Data entered into the platform by the patient will be transferred to R EDCap in a file format and de-
identified prior to presentation to the data management and statistics team for analysis .  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
25 The Tonic for Health platform is cloud based. The platform is currently in use MedStar system -wide 
clinical settings , including in MedStar Medical Group practices and for the MedStar patient portal. The 
platform interfaces with MedStar systems have been s tructured by MedStar to meet all system -
required security and privacy requirements.    
 
Because this pilot study, by design, is not assessing lab clinical outcomes the study will not be conducting any study -provided laboratory tests.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS & DATA ANALYSIS  
Analysis Plan . A convenience sample of 4  nursing units  and approximately 60 patients/unit, for a 
total of 240 patients for whom data will be collected and analyzed,  will be utilized  in this pilot study 
designed to generate preliminary data to inform a future pragmatic trial.  
   Baseline Characteristics: Summary statistics,  including means, medians, standard deviations for 
continuous variables and, frequencies and percentages for categorical variables on all baseline data will be obtained for the overall sample  and by nursing unit.  The factors that may inf luence patients’ 
non-participation decision will be examined by testing associations with baseline variables such as 
gender, race, age or severity of patients’ conditions. Two- sample t -tests, Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA), chi -square analyses and other nonparametric tests will be conducted as appropriate for the 
proposed bivariate analyses. DM2- related measurements A1C and blood glucose will also be 
described using summary statistics for the baseline and before the patient gets discharged and the differences  will be tested using paired t -tests (or non- parametric tests when needed). The data 
collected at this stage will allow us to better evaluate the effectiveness of the education by controlling for patients’ DM2 measures at discharge.   
 
Pilot Outcomes : The effect of the intervention on  Knowledge and Skills Acquisition outcomes will 
be examined by computing the differences in the total score of KNOW Diabetes survey between baseline and discharge. The differences will be tested using paired t -test for the continuous scores 
and McNemar’s or symmetry test for the categories of specific items of interest  The data collected on 
the number of times the education module replayed until competency demonstrated, the time used, the amount of content skipped (skills acquis ition) will be summarized using descriptive statistics and 
correlated with patients’ characteristics to better understand the difficulties experienced by the patients.  Medication Adherence, a patient -centered behavioral outcome, will be measured at 
baseline and 30 -day follow -up. To test  if medication adherence has increased as a result of the 
intervention, the changes in continuous scores at baseline and at 30 days  will be computed and the 
percentage of patients who show “ improvement in Rx adherence
” will be obtained.  ED/Hospital 
readmissions and missed work/activity days within the 30 days after discharge will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics and their associations with baseline and discharge characteristics will be explored using bivariate analyses. M ultivariate analyses using linear (change in 
continuous scores of KNOW Diabetes and MA8),  logistic (increase in medication adherence) and 
Poisson (count outcomes such as the number of replays, readmissions, days of missed work/activity) regression models  will be conducted by  adjusting for potential confounders  at baseline or discharge 
(age, race, BMI, gender , comorbidities, A1C – when available-  and blood glucose) within the 
constraints of the final sample size of approximately 240 patients ). IT Platform Adoption Metrics - # 
and % of modules viewed; time used; content skipped; content replayed.  
Implementation Effectiveness Evaluation Approach  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
26   Implementation effectiveness evaluation  will be guided by  the RE -AIM32,33,54,55 framework . Our 
approach will consider differences in hospital and nursing workflow, patient characteristics and be 
sensitive to differences in patient culture, knowledge and beliefs. Our mixed methods approach to 
operationalizing the RE -AIM framework will select qualitative and quantitative outcomes at the setting, 
staff, and patient levels. Table 6 provides an overview of the RE -AIM domains, definition, and 
proposed strategy for evaluation data.

outcomes at 30 days.  
 
The team, led by Dr. Smith , will identify and validate barriers and facilitators o f reach, effectiveness, 
adoption, implementation, and maintenance in each study phase. The PRISM and RE -AIM will utilize  
a combination of interviews, surveys, direct observations, and existing data systems to inform 
intervention fidelity and effectiveness (Table 7 ).

    Outcome s Identification and Analyses: A mix of quantitative and qualitative data is expected to 
be available to evaluate intervention effectiveness. Quantitative data may be sourced from case 
record forms, clinical databases,  patient and provider surveys and other data capt ured during 
implementation (T ables 4 & 5 ). Qualitative data from ethnographic observations, key informant 
interviews and focus groups will be analyzed using standard techniques.56,57 Content codes will be 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
27 generated using an iterative process involving transcript review, generation of preliminary codes, 
team review, revision, application or codes to transcripts, elaboration, and continued application and elaboration as needed. When the full team concurs that  the code list captures all themes identified in 
the transcripts, a research assistant will be trained to code all transcripts. Another team member will also code a subset of at least 10% of the transcripts to check coding consistency. Dr. Smith ( IE lead) 
will meet with the coders to resolve any discrepancies and to discuss any text that is not readily 
coded with the existing list. R eview will continue until coding is reliable. . 
 
9 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
As described in the data collection and management process there will be review of by the study 
team  of the data t o ensure consistency of coding. A sub set will be by another member of the team to 
check consistency of data entry.

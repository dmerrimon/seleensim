Study Title:   A Phase II Trial of High -dose Bendamustine, Etoposide, Cytarabine, and Melphalan 
(BeEAM) in the Up -front Treatment of Multiple Myeloma  
Phase :  II 
Number of Patients:   65 
Study O bjectives   
Primary  
 To estimate the response at day 100 following transplant . 
Secondary  
 To obtain estimates of overall survival (OS), event -free survival (EFS ), and non -relapse 
mortality (NRM).  
 Characterize the hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities of high-dose bendamustine  
when given as part of the BeEAM preparative regimen prior to autologous stem cell 
transplantation . 
Overview of Study Design:    
High -dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation  (ASCT)  as part of the up -front 
treatment of patients with multiple myeloma has been associated with improved disease -free and 
overall survival in multiple large randomized controlled trials.  Following 3 -6 cycles of standard 
inducti on therapy with biologic agents, consolidation with high dose Melpha lan and ASCT  has 
become the standard -of-care approach for fit myeloma patients up to 70 years of age.  Single -agent 
high-dose Melphalan (200mg/m2) is currently the standard -of-care preparative regimen prior to 
autologous transplant in Myeloma.  Historical s tudies utilizing Busulfan - or Total Body Irradiation -
based preparative regimens have yielded similar results to single -agent Melphalan with higher 
toxicity.  
Achievement of a complete response ( CR) following autologous transplant for myeloma has been 
associ ated with improved disease -free and overall survival  in multiple studies1-5.  Therefore, m ore 
efficacious high-dose chemotherapy regimens that improve post -transplant CR rates should translate 
into better survival for myeloma patients.   The regimen BeEAM, utilizing high -dose bendamustine, 
etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan, has been utilized successfully in  older lymphoma patients with 
excellent activity (80% CR rate), acceptable morbidity and no treatment -related mortality6.  
Bendamustine is an active ag ent in the treatment of multiple myeloma7.  We hypothesize that 
incorporation of bendamustine in the high -dose preparative regimen will translate into better quality 
and more durable res ponses in myeloma patients.  
Myeloma patients, following up -front induc tion therapy, will receive an ASCT following a high -
dose bendamustine -based preparative regimen (BeEAM). The primary endpoint of this trial will be 
the rate of CR at day 100 post -transplant. Experience from the literature, as well as results from our 
institution, suggests that following ASCT for the upfront treatment of myeloma, the rate of CR at 
day 100 post -transplant is approximately 45%.  It is hoped that under this protocol, this rate will be 
at least 65%. Thus we statistically formalize this study by testing the null hypothesis that p, the CR 
rate is 0.65 or more versus the alternative hypothesis that p is less than 0.45. A sample size of 65 pts 
gives 90% power with an alpha=0.05, using the formula for a one sample binomial (two -sided) test

Confidential   05May17  6 1.0 BACKGR OUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell disorder characterized by lytic bon e disease, 
renal dysfunction, abnormal hematopoietic function, and the presence of a monoclonal 
paraprotein in the blood and/or urine. Historical induction regimens rarely achieved major 
responses [very good partial remission (VGPR) or complete remission ( CR)], and before the use 
of high -dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation  (ASCT), few therapeutic 
options showed significant improvements in overall survival (OS) for newly diagnosed myeloma 
patients1,2. Over the last several decades, th e treatment of MM has improved strikingly. Although 
not curative, autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) improves the likelihood of a complete 
response (CR), prolongs progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and 
represents a major ad vance in MM therapy.  
 
Led first by the Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM), several groups have now shown 
improvements in survival for patients randomized to receive HDT when compared with 
conventional dose chemotherapy3, rendering HDT a standard trea tment approach for younger 
patients with newly diagnosed MM. In addition, the IFM has shown that achievement of a VGPR 
is a surrogate for improvement in PFS and OS4, adding it as a new category in the revised 
International Myeloma Working Group response cr iteria5. CR is a prerequisite for tumor control 
and eventual cure in most, if not all, hematologic malignancies. CR rates in myeloma have 
improved substantially with stem cell transplantation. Improving CR rates is felt to be an 
important surrogate for the  long-term goal of improving survival in myeloma.  Achievement of 
CR following autologous transplant for myeloma has been associated with improved disease -free 
and overall survival in multiple studies6-10. 
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  7 Despite these improvements, patients are rarely, i f ever, cured of MM through the use of HDT. 
To improve the efficacy of the HDT maneuver itself, groups have explored the use of multiple 
cycles of HDT (tandem transplant11-13), the use of combination chemotherapy conditioning 
regimens using agents in addit ion to or replacing melphalan in HDT conditioning14-17, and the 
addition of radiation therapy using targeted antibodies18-19 or external beam radiation20. 
Unfortunately, none of these approaches has been shown to be superior to the use of 200 mg/m2 
of melp halan. Thus, if we are to improve on the efficacy of HDT, alternative combination 
approaches are needed.  
1.2  Anti -myeloma effect of Bendamustine  
Bendamustine  is a novel bifunctional alkylating agent consisting of three structural elements: a 
2-chloroethylami ne alkylating group; a butyric acid side chain; and a benzimidazole ring. 
Although its precise mechanism of action is as yet unknown, it appears to exert its antineoplastic 
effects via a different mechanism to those of other alkylating agents.  Bendamustin e has 
demonstrated significant efficacy in patients with indolent lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL), including in patients with disease refractory to conventional alkylating agents 
and rituximab. The toxicity profile of bendamustine is also superior to that of conventional 
alkylating agents. Bendamustine has promising activity in multiple myeloma (MM)21-25. 
Bendamustine seems to be efficacious either in monotherapy or in combination with other drugs 
in previously treated or untreated patients . Moreover, it has an acceptable toxicity profile and is 
suitable for patients with renal impairment. It is currently licensed in Europe for use as frontline 
treatment with prednisolone for patients with MM who are unsuitable for transplantation and 
who ar e contraindicated for thalidomide and bortezomib therapy.   
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  8 1.3 Rationale for use of Bendamustine in HDT/ASCT      
Given the efficacy and favorable safety profile of bendamustine, it is natural to explore this drug 
in the HDT/ASCT setting.   In the setting of r elapsed/refractory lymphoma, Visani and 
colleagues performed  a phase 1 -2 study to test the safety and the efficacy of increasing doses of 
bendamustine, coupled with fixed doses of etoposide,  cytarabine, and melphalan ( BeEAM), in 
the conditioning regimen pr ior to ASCT for resistant/relapsed lymphoma patients26.  Forty -three 
patients (median age, 47 years) with non -Hodgkin (n = 28) or Hodgkin (n = 15) lymphoma were 
consecutively treated. Nine patients entered the phase 1 study; no patients experienced a dose -
limiting toxicity. Thirty -four additional patients were then treated in the phase 2  study . All 
patients engrafted, with a median time to absolute neutrophil count > 0.5 x 10(9)/L of 10 days. 
The 100 -day transplantation -related mortality was 0%. After a med ian follow -up of 18 months, 
35 of 43 patients (81%) were  in complete remission, whereas 6 of 43 relapsed and 2 of 43 did not 
respond.  
1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits  
Bendamustine  
Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine -like 
benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These 
groups form covalent bonds with electron -rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand 
DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to ce ll death via several pathways. 
Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action 
of bendamustine remains unknown.   The drug  is 94% –96% bound to plasma proteins, and is 
primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to no n-cytotoxic metabolites. Two minor active metabolites 
are formed via CYP1A2. Bendamustine does not induce nor inhibit CYP metabolic pathways. 
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  9 Approximately 90% of the administered drug is recovered from the excreta, primarily feces. 
Bendamustine is current ly FDA approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia and indolent non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  Bendamustine has promising activity in 
multiple myeloma and  is currently licensed in Europe for use as frontline treatment with 
prednisolo ne for patients with MM who are unsuitable for transplantation and who are 
contraindicated for thalidomide and bortezomib therapy.  Most common adverse reactions are 
neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, 
pyrexia,  constipation, anorexia, cough, headache, weight loss, dyspnea, rash, and stomatitis . 
 
Etoposide   
Etoposide is a semisynthetic derivative of the podophyllotoxins, an epipodophyllotoxin. It 
inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA synthe sis. Etoposide is cell cycle 
dependent and phase specific, affec ting mainly the S and G2 phases .  Etoposide is m etabolized in 
the liver via the cytochrome p450 system (CYP3A4  involved).   Elimination is described by two  
compartment  open model, with the prim ary route of  elimination being  renal. Biliary excretion 
accounts for up to 44% recovery in  feces.   Etoposide is currently FDA approved in the treatment 
of testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer.  Most common adverse reactions are neutropenia, 
anemia,  thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, esophagitis, hypotension, 
alopecia, hepatic toxicity, and allergic reactions.   
 
Cytarabine  
Cytarabine is an antineoplastic agent. Cytarabine is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside, which is 
converte d intracellularly to the nucleotide, cytarabine triphosphate. The exact mechanism of 
action of cytarabine is  not fully understood, but cytarabine triphosphate appears to inhibit DNA 
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  10 synthesis by the inhibition of  DNA polymerase. Cytarabine’s actions are ce ll-cycle specific.   
Cytarabine is rapidly metabolised, mainly in the liver, to the inactive metabolite  1-β-D-
arabinofuranosyluracil. About 70 to 80% of a dose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours;  
approximately 90% as the metabolite and 10% as unchanged cytarabine .  Cytarabine in 
combination with other approved anticancer drugs is indicated for remissio n induction in acute 
non-lymphocytic leukemia of adults and children. It has also been found useful in the treatment 
of acute lymphocytic leukemia and the blast phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia .  Most 
common adverse reactions are neutropenia, anemia, t hrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, stomatitis, alopecia, skin rash, and conjunctivitis . 
 
Melphalan  
Melphalan, a bifunctional nitrogen mustard -derivative alkylating agent, is t he L-isomer of 
mechlorethamine.  Melphalan inhibits DNA and RNA synthes is via formation of interstrand 
cross -links with DNA, likely binding  at the N7 position of guanine.  Melphalan is cell cycle 
phase -nonspecific.   Melphalan does not undergo metabolic activation and is inactivated in the 
plasma, primarily by non -enzymatic hyd rolysis to monohydroxymelphalan and 
dihydroxymelphalan.  At conventional intravenous dosage, melphalan is indicated in the 
treatment of multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer. At high intravenous dosage, it is indicated, 
with or without hematopoietic stem cel l transplantation, for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
and childhood neuroblastoma.  Most common adverse reactions are neutropenia, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, esophagitis, and alopecia.

Regimen -related toxicities  
Toxicities directly related to the administration of high -dose chemotherapy include 
gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting, mucositis), alopecia, infertility (which may be 
permanent), interstitial pneumoni tis, idiopathic cardiomyopathy , hepatic sinus oidal obstruction 
syndrome , or multi -organ failure which may be fatal.  
 
Infection  
Infection is a major cause of morbidity in ASCT and is a major concern in these patients.  
Infections may be bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal.  Often, these infections are life -
threatening, particularly when caused by viral or fungal organisms, and are associated with high 
mortality in the transplant population.  
 
Reproductive Considerations  
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this study, 
she must inform the investigator immediately and must permanently discontinue study drug. This 
also applies to male patients whose partners become pregnant while the patient is on study or 
within the 12 week period after last dose of study d rug. Patients of reproductive potential (males 
and females) must practice double -barrier methods of contraception during treatment and for 12 
weeks following the last dose of Bendamustine. Adequate contraception is defined as double -
barrier protection (i.e ., condom plus spermicide in combination with a diaphragm, cervical/vault 
cap, or intrauterine device). Birth control pills, birth control patches and/or injections of 
hormones or (in males) surgical sterilization (i.e., status post -vasectomy) to prevent p regnancy 
are not considered an adequate method of preventing pregnancy, and double -barrier protection is

The primary endpoint of this trial will be the rate of CR at d ay 100 post -transplant. Experience

upfront treatment of myeloma, the rate of CR at day 100 post -transplant is approximately 45%.  
It is hoped that under this  protocol, this rate will be at least 65%. Thus we statistically formalize 
this study by testing the null hypothesis that p, the CR rate is 0.65 or more versus the alternative 
hypothesis that p is less than 0.45. A sample size of 65 pts gives 90% power wit h an alpha=0.05, 
using the formula for a one sample binomial (two -sided) test of a proportion.   We expect that 
patients will be accrued over 2 years.  
 
7.0    ADVERSE EVENTS    
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Pretreatment Event Definition  
A pretreatment event is any untoward medica l occurrence in a patient or subject who has signed 
informed consent to participate in a study but before administration of any study medication; it 
does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation . 
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  18 7.1.2 Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  
This includes any newly occurring e vent, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or 
frequency since the administration of study drug.  
 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modificatio n, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline.    
 
Adverse events will be collected from the time the patient signs the informed consent and ends 
30 days after the discontinuation of do sing or completion of the patient’s participation in the 
study if the last scheduled visit occurs at a later time.  
7.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator will comply with all safety reporting regulations as set forth in the Code of 
Federal Regul ations.  The investigator being the sponsor of the study has the sole responsibility 
for reporting  all serious adverse events to the Northside Hospital Institutional Review Board (the 
IRB of record), TEVA pharmaceuticals and if serious and either likely, p ossibly, probably, or 
definitely related to study drug to the FDA .  For informational  purposes any correspondence to 
the FDA regarding adverse events or other safety issues will be simultaneously copied to 
us.clinops.sae@tevapharm.com  or reported to Teva via facsimile at 215 -619-3825. The 
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  19 investigator will communicate the occurrence of serious adverse events to Teva and the IRB of 
record within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  Reporting of Adverse  Events to Teva 
does not preclude the responsibility of the investigator to report adverse events to the FDA.   
7.1.4 Serious Adverse Event Definition  
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death.  
 Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe).  
 Requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hosp italization  (see 
clarification  in the paragraph below on planned hospitalizations).  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 Is a medically important event .  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious 
when, based on appropriate medical judgment,  may jeopardize the patient, require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.   Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchosp asm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any 
organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prio n protein transmitting Transmissible 
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  20 Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious 
agent.   
 Results in a dev elopment of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 Is a serious adverse drug experience  
Clarification should be made b etween a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in 
intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The 
general term severe  is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event 
itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  
This is NOT the same as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria 
described above, and  is usually associated with events that pose a t hreat to a patient’s life or 
ability to function.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered 
serious.  For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered 
Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
7.2 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse  Events  
The following AEs will  be reported to the Northside Hospital Institutional Review Board, from 
the date th e participant receives the first dose of study drug through 30 days after administration 
of the last dost of Bendamustine:  
·         Grade 1 adverse events do not need recorded  
·         Grade 2 unexpected  and probably/definitely related  
·          All non-hematologic  grades  3, 4 & 5 possibly/probably/definitely related  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during treatment with Bendamustine or for 30 days after the 
completion of Bendamustine treatment that the sponsor -investigator and/or sub -investigator 
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  21 conside rs to be possibly/probably/definitely related to the study drug must be reported to 
Northside Hospital Institutional Review Board.  The investigator must notify Teva of any serious 
adverse events that may occur after this time period which the investigator believes to be 
definitely, likely or possibly related to the study product.   
 
Additionally, the following will also be deemed to be adverse events for purposes of this study; 
pregnancy exposure, infant exposure during breastfeeding, overdose, abuse, misus e, medication 
errors, lack of efficacy, infectious agents, as well as all reports of accidental pediatric exposure 
and other safety information as reasonably requested by the sponsor.  In the event the IRB 
requests additional safety information from the in vestigator, investigator will notify Teva of such 
request within one (1) business day.  
 
New primary malignancies that occur during the follow -up periods must be reported, regardless  
of causality to study regime n, for a minimum of  three  years  after the last  dose of the 
investigational product, starting from the first dose of study drug.  
 
Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed before 
the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered SAEs unless the condition 
deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later 
than planned).  A visit to the hospital emergency room or hospital clinic would not be considered  
inpatient hospitalization; however, it could  be considered serious if medical intervention was 
necessary in order to prevent a serious outcome.  It should be noted that disease progression, and 
death due to disease progression will be considered clinical endpoints for the study, and will not 
be cons idered serious adverse events.  
Blood & Marrow Transplant Program  
Northside Hospital     
Confidential   05May17  22  
All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a 
patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).

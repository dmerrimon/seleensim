Name of Sponsor : Capricor , Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product:  CAP -1002 Allogeneic Cardiosphere- Derived Cells  
Name of Active Ingredient:  Cardiosphere- Derived Cells  
IND Number:  
Title of Trial : A Phase 2, Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo -Controlled Trial Evaluating the Safety 
and Efficacy of Intravenous Delivery of Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells in Subjects with 
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
Trial Name:  Halt myOPathy progrEssion ( HOPE -2) 
Trial Centers:  Up to 15 (USA)  
National Principal Investigator:    
Principal Investigators: This is a multi- center trial  with multiple P rincipal Investigators. 
Study P eriod: Approximately 24 months  Phase of D evelopment: 2  
Objectives :  
Primary : Evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) CAP -1002 administered every three 
months in subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD) and impair ed skeletal muscle function   
Secondary : Evaluate the impact of repeated IV administrations of CAP -1002 on exploratory efficacy 
assessments of skeletal and cardiac muscle function, and quality of life  
Methodology: This P hase 2, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled trial will assess 
the safety and efficacy of allogeneic cardiosphere- derived cells (CDCs ), or CAP -1002, administered as 
four IV infusions, one  every three months , for the treatment of subje cts with DMD.  Subjects  with a 
clinical diagnosis of DMD confirmed by genetic testing and evidence of skeletal  muscle impairment will 
undergo a battery of tests and procedures during a 30- day screening period to determine eligibility based 
on protocol  inclu sion and exclusion criteria.  
Eligible subjects will be prospectively randomized in stratified permuted blocks  to CAP -1002 or placebo 
(1:1 ratio ). To allow sufficient time for delivery of Investigational Product (IP) , subjects must be 
randomized  approximately  7 days in advance of the ir first IV infusion of Investigational Product (IP)  on 
Day 1. Rand omization will be stratified by  site and entry item score of the Performance of the Upper 
Limb 1.2 (PUL) . Subjects will undergo baseline safety and efficacy assessments ( Table 3 ) prior to the 
first infusion of IP (CAP -1002 or placebo). Administration of IP (Day 1) should occur within a maximum 
of 14 days  following randomization ; if a delay of more than 14 days between randomization and IP 
administration is unavoidable, a conversation between the Investigator and Medical Monitor should 
occur to determine  the need for repeat assessments prior to in fusion. Subjects who are not randomized 
may be re- screened  at the discretion of the Investigator.

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   Subjects will complete study assessments at Screening ; Baseline ( ≤ 2 days prior to Day 1) ; Day 1 ; Week s 
4 and 6 (±7 days , each ); Month 3 (±14 days), Month 4.5 (±14 days), and Months 6, 9, and 12 (±14 days, 
each).  
All IV infusions will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the investigative site on Day 1 and Months 
3, 6, and 9.  Prior to each IP infusion, medications will be administered to the subject as determined by 
the Investigator based on the pre -treatment guidelines provide d by Capricor and/or institutional protocols 
to minimize the risk  of potential severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.  Subject s will be observed 
in the outpatient setting for at least two hours post infusion and then discharged the same day if medi cally 
cleared by the site Investigator. As part of these visits, subjects will complete a safety phone call 14 days 
(±3 days) after each IP infusion, and if clinical ly indicated, an unscheduled in -person visit will be 
performed  at the investigative site with targeted assessments based on presentation of signs and 
symptoms . 
Blood samples for donor -specific antibody  (DSA) testing will be collected at Baseline , Week 4, 14- 30 
days prior to the IP infusions scheduled for the Month 3, 6 and 9 visits , and Month 12. Blood c ollections 
for clinical laboratory and DSA testing at Week 4and pre -dose DSA testing at Months 3, 6, and 9 will 
occur either at the investigative site or remotely at  a designated central laboratory patient service cent er. 
Blood collection for biomarker and exploratory biomarker testing at Week 6 and Month 4.5 will be 
conducted for those subjects who are able to travel to the investigative site.  
If trial evidence suggests an appropriate risk/benefit profile of CAP -1002, Capricor , upon the 
recommendation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), will introduce an open- label extension 
study to offer CAP- 1002 to subjects who were randomized to placebo and completed the 12- month 
follow-up period of the original trial.  
The primary safety endpoints  include the incidence of the following from baseline through the 12-month 
timepoint:  
• Acute  respiratory decompensation within 2 hours following IP administration 
• Hypersensitivity reaction  
− Hypersensitivity reaction is  defined as a clinical syndrome including , but not limited to , 
fever, leukocytosis, or rash with onset ≤ 2 hours post infusion and lasting < 24 hours, in 
the absence of clinical signs of concomitant infection.  
• All-cause mortality  
• Serious adverse events  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events related to IP or administration procedure  
• Immune sensitization syndrome  
− Immune sensitization syndrome shall be defined as: (a) clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with systemic inflammation (e.g., fever, leukocytosis, rash, or arthralgia) with 
onset ≥ 24 hours post infusion and the absence of clinical signs of concomitant infection, 
AND (b) elevation of anti -human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) antibodies against the donor 
cells (i.e., DSAs) , detected ≤ 30 days following onset of syndrome, of (i) ≥ 2000 mean 
fluorescent intensity (MFI) if baseline  MFI ≤ 1000, or (ii) ≥ 2 times baseline otherwise

Analysis Populations   
The following analysis populations will be defined for the trial: 
Safety Population: Subjects who begin an infusion of IP. Safety endpoints for s ubjects will be 
summarized and analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population : Subjects who were randomized. Subjects will be summarized and 
analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized. 
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population : For each efficacy parameter, the mITT population will  
include subjects in the ITT population who have a baseline observation (i.e., mITT populations are 
parameter -specific). Subjects will be summarized and analyzed in the treatment group to which they 
were randomized.  
Per Protocol Population: Subjects who received IP with no deviations/ violations that could significantly 
impact the completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the trial data. The list of subjects in the per 
protocol population will be compiled prior to database lock.  
Interim Analysis for Futility  
An interim analysis was performed based on data collected for the twenty treated subjects and submitted 
to the DSMB for review. The DSMB made a recommendation to continue the trial as originally designed. After review of the DSMB recommendation, the Sponsor decided to continue trial follow -up for the 
currently enrolled subjects but to terminate further enrollment in the trial. No additional interim analyses are planned.  
Safety Analysis  
Safety parameters will be evaluated using the safety population. The incidence of adverse events and 
any serious adverse events will be summarized by event types and the proportion of subjects with those events. There are no formal tests of hypotheses associated with the primary safety endpoint. 
Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated in the ITT population, with possible supportive analyses 
in the mITT and PP populations. Comparisons between treatment groups on efficacy endpoints will be 
done using repeated measures linear models. Other analy ses may also be done using appropriate 
parametric or non- parametric methods, depending on distributions of the data and whether or not model 
assumptions are met. An algorithm detailing the decision- making process for performing the primary 
efficacy analysi s, in light of features of the data that cannot be known until the data are observed (e.g., 
outliers), will be detailed in the SAP.  
Pharmacoeconomic Analysis The pharmacoeconomic analysis will be done using the safety population.

5.1. Background  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, X -linked, progressive disease affecting 
approximately one in 3,600 to 9,200 male births  (Mah et al., 2014) . It is caused by mutations in 
the dystrophin gene resulting in the absence of or non- functional dystrophin protein ( Hoffman et 
al., 1988) . 
Dystrophin is a cytoplasmic protein encoded by the dmd  gene, which links cytoskeletal actin 
filaments to membrane proteins. The dystrophin protein acts as a shock absorber during muscle 
fiber contraction by linking the actin of the contracti le apparatus to the layer of connective tissue 
that surrounds each muscle fiber ( Koenig et al., 1988; Fairclough et al., 2013; Aartsma -Rus et al., 
2016). 
Due to the lack of dystrophin, the connection between the actin cytoskeleton and connective tissue 
is lost, inducing excessive membrane fragility and permeability, dysregulation of cal cium 
homeostasis, and oxidative damage, which results in muscle cell necrosis  and a chronic 
inflammatory state . Initially , muscle necrosis is followed by regeneration, but with age, the 
regenerative ability of myofibers is lost and muscle fibers are gradually replaced by connective 
and adipose tissue. It has been postulated that chronic injury and regeneration induce satellite cell 
exhaustion. Recent studies suggest that the absence of dystrophin in satellite cells impairs their ability to divide properly, thus reducing the generation of myogenic progenitors that are needed 
for proper muscle regeneration ( Dumont et al., 2015) . As a consequence, muscle function is lost  
(Muntoni et al., 2003; Deconinck and Dan, 2007; Falzarano et al., 2015).  
DMD occurs  in early childhood, with degeneration occurring progressively in the skeletal 
musculature and ultimately in the heart and respiratory muscles, resulting in premature death 
(Hendriksen et al., 2015) . Progressive weakness and muscle atrophy caused by degenerating 
muscle fibers begins in the lower extremities and pelvis before spreading into the upper 
extremities . Other symptoms include loss of some reflexes, a waddling gait, frequent falls, 
difficulty  when rising from a sitting or lying position or when climbing stairs, changes to overall 
posture, and impaired breathing. Many children precipitously lose the ability to run or jump. The 
atrophied muscles, in particular the calf muscles, and less commonly, muscles in the buttocks, shoulders, and arms, may be enlarged by an accumulation of fat and connective tissue, causing them to look larger and healthier than they actually are ( “pseudohypertrophy” ). Bone thinning and 
scoliosis are common. Ultimately, a w heelchair becomes necessary, in most cases between 12 to15 
years of age ( Henricson et al., 2013).  
As the disease progresses, the muscles in the diaphragm that assist in breathing and coughing 
becom e weaker. Affected individuals experience breathing difficulties, respiratory infections, and 
swallowing problems. Almost all DMD patients will develop cardiomyopathy ( Aartsma -Rus et al., 
2016) . Pne umonia, compounded by cardiac involvement , is the most frequent cause of death, 
which typically occur s in the late teens or early 20s. However, improvements in multidisciplinary 
care, in particular respiratory care and various forms of assisted ventilation, have extended the life 
expectancy; numerous individuals with DMD now survive into their 30s, and some even into their 40s ( Emery, 2002; Bushby et al., 2010; Bushby et al., 2010).

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential    Furthe r i nformation about the allergic reactions is found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure and Section 13.2.1.3.   
These collective data suggest that repeat administration of CAP -1002 should be reasonably safe in 
humans. However, the risk of severe allergic reactions should be minimized by administration of 
medications that will be determined by the Investigator based on the pre -treatment guidelines 
provided by Capricor (Section  21.2) and/or institutional protocols.   
5.7. Trial  Population  
The target population for this trial includes pediatric and adult males with a diagnosis of DMD , 
evidence of skeletal muscle impairment regardless of ambulatory status, and on a  stable regimen 
of systemic glucocorticoids ( see Inclusion Criterion 8 for additional details regarding stable 
regimen of systemic glucocorticoids).

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
7.1. Overall Trial  Design  
This Phase 2, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled trial will assess the 
safety and efficacy of allogeneic CDCs, or CAP -1002, administered as four IV infusions, one every 
three months, for the treatment of subjects with DMD. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of DMD 
confirmed by genetic testing and evidence of skeletal muscle impairment will undergo a battery of tests and procedures during a 30- day screening period to determine eligibility based on protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Eligible subjects will be prospectively randomized in stratified permuted blocks to CAP -1002 or 
placebo (1:1 ratio) approximately 7 days prior to the first IV infusion of IP on Day 1. 
Randomization will be stratified by site and entry item score of the PUL 1.2 module . Subjects will 
undergo baseline safety and efficacy assessments ( Table 3 ) prior to the first infusion of IP (CAP -
1002 or placebo). Administration of IP (Day 1) should occur within a maximum of 14 days 
following randomization; if a delay of more than 14 days between randomization and IP 
administration is unavoidable, a conversation between the Investigator and Medical Monitor should occur to determine  the need for repeat assessments prior to infusion . Subjects that are not 
randomized may be re -screened at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Subjects will complete study assessments  at Screening ; Baseline (≤ 2 days prior to Day 1) ; Day 1 ; 
Week s 4 (±7 days) ; and Months 3,6, 9, and 12 (±14 days, each ). If the subject can  travel to the 
investigative site, blood samples will be collected at Week 6 ( ±7 days) and Month 4.5 (±14 days ).  
All IV infusions will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the investigative site on Day 1 and 
Months 3, 6, and 9. Prior to each  IP infusion, medication(s) will be administered to the subject as 
determined by the Investigator based on the pre- treatment guidelines (see Section  21.2)  and/or 
institutional protocols to minimize the risk of pot ential  severe allergic reaction s such as 
anaphylaxis. Subjects will be observed in the outpatient setting for at least two hours post infusion 
and then discharged the same day if medically cleared by the site Investigator. As part of these visits, subjects  will complete a  safety phone call 14 days (±3 days) after each IP infusion, and if 
clinically indicated, an unscheduled in- person visit will be performed at the investigative site with 
targeted assessments based on presentation of signs and symptoms.  
Blood samples for DSA testing will be collected at Baseline, Week 4, 14- 30 days prior to the IP 
infusions scheduled for the Month 3, 6 and 9 visits, and Month 12. Blood c ollections  for clinical 
laboratory and DSA testing at Week 4 and pre -dose DSA testing at Months 3, 6, and 9 will occur 
either at the investigative site or remotely at a designated central laboratory patient service center.  
Blood collection for biomarker and exploratory biomarker testing at Week 6 and Month 4.5 will 
be conducted for those subjects who are able to travel to the investigative site.  If trial evidence suggests an appropriate risk/benefit profile of CAP -1002, Capricor , upon the 
recommendation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), may introduce an open -label 
extension study to offer CAP -1002 to subjects who were randomized to placebo and completed 
the 12-month follow-up period of the original trial.

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   7.2. Trial  Endpoints  
7.2.1. Primary Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoints  include the incidence of the following from baseline through the 12 -
month timepoint :  
• Acute respiratory decompensation within 2 hours following IP administration 
• Hypersensitivity reaction  
− Hypersensitivity reaction is defined as a clinical syndrome including, but not 
limited to, fever, leukocytosis, or rash with onset ≤ 2 hours post infusion and lasting < 24 hours, in the absence of clinical signs of concomitant infection.  
• All-cause mortality  
• Serious adverse events  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events related to IP  or administration procedure 
• Immune sensitization syndrome 
− Immune sensitization syndrome shall be defined as: (a) clinical signs and symptoms consistent with systemic inflammation (e.g., fever, leukocytosis, rash or arthralgia) 
with onset ≥ 24 hours post i nfusion and the absence of clinical signs of concomitant 
infection, AND (b) elevation of anti -human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies 
against the donor cells (i.e., DSAs), detected ≤ 30 days following onset of syndrome, of (i) ≥ 2000 MFI if baseline MFI ≤  1000, or (ii) ≥ 2 times baseline 
otherwise 
The primary efficacy endpoint  is change from baseline to the 12 -month timepoint in functional 
capacity as assessed by the mid -level (elbow) dimension of the PUL 1.2. 
7.2.2. Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary safety endpo int is the incidence and severity of all adverse events through the 12-
month timepoint.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints  include the change from baseline for the following: 
• Mid-level (elbow) dimension of the PUL 1.2 at Months 3, 6, and 9 (Month 12 is the 
primary endpoint)  
• Regional systolic left ventricular  wall thickening as assessed by cardiac MRI  at Months 
6 and 12  
7.2.3. Exploratory Endpoints

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   7.4. Treatment Assignment  
Subjects will be prospectively randomized in stratified permuted blocks in a 1:1 allocation to 
intravenous infusion of either CAP -1002 or placebo. See Section 9.4  for additional details related 
to randomization.   
7.5. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
There are no planned dose adjustments. Should an acute toxicity arise during the infusion (e .g., 
hypersensitivity reaction, pulmonary decompensation, etc.), the infusion should be terminated 
immediately,  and the actual total dose administered recorded. Any decision about re -challenging 
in a subsequent infusion should be made after discussions with the Investigator, Medical M onitor, 
Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ), and other medical experts that may be required to make 
an informed decision. 
7.6. Criteria for Trial Termination  
The trial may be terminated at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, a 
recommendation by the DSMB  for safety reasons , an action by the FDA , or decision by Capricor .

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   3 Subjects must will be randomized between approximately 7 days  in advance of their first IP infusion on Day 1. This lead time is to ensure adequate IP shipping 
times (see IP Manual for shipping specifications) . Randomization will be stratified by site and entry item score of the PUL1.2 at screening.  Administration of 
IP on Day 1 should occur within a maximum of 14 days following randomization; if a delay of more than 14 days between randomization and IP administr ation 
is unavoidable, a conversation between the Investigator and Medical Monitor should occur to determine the need for repeat assessments prior to infusion.  
Subjects that are not randomized may be re -screened at the discretion of the Investigator.  
4 Updates regarding frequency of wheelchair use, transition to wheelchair full time, ventilatory support, and frequency of fall s.  
5 A blood sample for tryptase should be obtained within 3 hours of the onset of allergic signs or symptoms, and a second red top tube should be drawn within 3 
hours of a severe allergic reaction, and frozen at - 20°C , for other future analyses .  
6 All IP infusions will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the investigative site.  Prior to each IP infusion, medications will be administered to the subject as 
determined by the Investigator based on the pre -treatment guidelines provided by Capricor and/or institutional protocols to minimize the risk of potential severe 
allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.   Subjects will be observed for at least 2 hours post infusion, including pulse oximetry monitoring for at least 30 minutes 
post infusion. Sites will observe local institutional policies related to parenteral infusions and post -infusion monitoring.  
7 A safety phone call will be performed 14 days  (±3 days) after each IP infusion, and if clinically indicated, an unscheduled in- person visit will be performed at 
the investigative site with targeted assessments based on presentation of signs and symptoms.  
8 Ulna length will be measured in all subjects.  Standing height will be measured if a subject is capable.  If standing height cannot be measured, height will be 
calculated using a measurement of ulna length per Section  13.1.2 .  
9 Paired forced -maneuver testing will be performed on Screening Day 1 and Day 2 (approximately 24 hours between testing sessions) to confirm acceptable FVC 
variance (exclusion criterion  7). PFT testing sequence: SVC, forced man euver (FEV 1/FVC/PEF), MIP, MEP, PCF, and IFR. 
10 Blood collections for clinical laboratory and DSA testing at Week 4 and pre -dose DSA testing at Months 3, 6, and 9 will occur either at the investigative site or 
remotely at a designated central laboratory patient service center . 
11 Blood and urine samples will be collected using trial- specific laboratory kits, and then shipped to and tested at a central laboratory . Required s ample collection 
for a visit may occur on multiple days; if the visit includes an IP infusion, sample collections should occur prior to IP administration. Baseline blood samples 
may be collected on Day 1 prior to IP administration to reduce number of venipunctures.  
12 Basic metabolic panel (Glucose, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Bicarbonate, BUN, Creatinine, Calcium), comprehensive hepatic pa nel (Albumin, Alkaline 
Phosphatase, Total Protein, ALT, AST , GGT, Direct Bilirubin, Total Bilirubin) . 
13 CBC with WBC differential, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet count  
14 Appearance, bilirubin, color, nitrite, occult blood, pH, protein, specific gravity, glucose, ketones, RBC, and WBC. If required, microscopic analysis of sediment 
will be performed and reported per occurrence  
15 DMD genetic testing will be available at screening for subjects who have not previously completed genetic testing or whose hi storical genetic results were not 
performed at a CLIA -certified laboratory as determ ined by an Investigator . The turn- around time for final results may exceed the 30-day screening window; 
allow 29 -49 days for receipt of final test results.  
16 Week 6 and Month 4.5 blood samples will only be collected at the investigative site. 17 Biomarkers may include those of muscle inflammation 
(osteopontin); systemic inflammation  (IL-1ß, IL -2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF -α, CXCL10); muscle damage (troponin I [cardiac, fast skeletal, slow skeletal], troponin 
T, CK-MM, CK- MB, creatine kinase [total], creatine phosphate, and creatinine); and muscle regeneration (myostatin and follistatin) . 
18 Collected only if separate informed consent and/or assent provided  
19 Subjects will undergo cardiac MRI if they are physically capable as determined by an Investigator.  Subjects that cannot complete a cardiac MRI as part of the 
trial will complete an echocardiogram at s creening using the site’s local equipment, acquisition protocol, and evaluation procedures. The reported LVEF from 
a local interpretation , whether it’s measured via cardiac MRI or echocardiogram,  will be used to assess eligibility (exclusion criterion  1).

participation in the trial 
22. Inability to comply with the investigational plan and follow -up visit schedule for any 
reason, in the judgment of the investigator 
8.3. Screen Failures  
Any subject who provides written informed consent/assent and is ultimately not randomized for whatever reason will be classified as a screen failure. All subjects, including screen failures, must be accounted for in the clinical database.  
Screen failures may be re- screened at the discretion of the Investigator  using the originally 
assigned screening number.   
8.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Every effort will be made to have each randomized subject complete all elements of the trial. If a 
subject has started at least one IP infusion and withdraws prior to trial completion, all attempts 
must be made to perform the trial assessments ind icated for the Month 12 visit (i.e., final 
comprehensive visit). 
Criteria for withdrawal from trial participation include the following reasons: 
• A subject may withdraw his consent at any time without prejudice to his care.  
• At the discretion of the Investi gator, the subject may be withdrawn from the trial for 
lack of adherence to the investigational plan.  
• A subject may be withdrawn from the trial for an acute reaction to IP or other safety 
issue that prevents repeat infusions. In this instance, the subject should be followed on 
schedule until completion of  assessment s through the Month 12 visit or for at least 3 
months post last IP infusion and then complete a final comprehensive visit.

Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential  Site per
sonnel and trial subjects, staff members at clinical research organizations (CROs), core 
laboratory personnel, and Clinical Event Committee (CEC) members will remain blinded to 
subject treat ment assignments until follow -ups have been completed on the currently enrolled 
subjects. This is a double -blind, placebo-controlled trial. IP will be prepared for IV infusion by 
site personnel who have been appropriately delegated by the Principal Investigator . The IP 
syringes once prepared will appear identical for both treatment groups. However, an 
investigational pharmacist may be able to differentiate  CAP -1002 from  placebo  based on the 
opacity  of the thawed concentrate observed during IP preparation . For this reason, t he 
investigational pharmacists will have limited  interaction with the blinded investigative site 
personnel.  
Please refer to Section  9.6 for more information related to emergency unblinding of the 
investigational product.   
9.6. Emergency Unblinding of Investigational Product  
To maintain the overall scientific integrity of the clinical trial, further unblinding or code breaks 
should occur only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment is 
absolutely essential for further management and treatment of the subject. Subject safety must 
always be the first consideration in making such a determination. Investigators are encouraged to 
discuss with the Medical Monitor prior to unblinding. In case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment is 
warranted. I f unblinding is deemed to be necessary, the Investigator should use the mechanism for 
emergency unblinding through the IWRS . If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, 
Capricor  must be notified within 24  hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the 
blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and case report form, as 
applicable. The Investigator is encouraged to maintain the blind as much as possible. Knowledge of the actu al allocation can generally be limited and not disclosed to the subject and/or other trial 
personnel including personnel  at other investigative sites , monitors, or other personnel involved in 
the trial; nor should there be any written or verbal disclosure of the code in any corresponding 
subject documents. Unblinding should not necessarily be a reason for termination from the trial.

All IP materials will be disposed following each IP infusion. Site personnel will f ollow institutional 
policies on the proper disposal of containers and disposables coming into contact with the IP. 
Generally, disposal like other biohazard red- bag trash that is ultimately incinerated should be 
sufficient to meet local institutional policies and any other regulations or laws.

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
Assessments to evaluate efficacy will be performed at trial visits as indicated in Table 3 .  
11.1. Sequence of Assessments  
To the best of the site’s ability, s ubjects  should complete assessments in the following sequence  
and at the same time of day throughout the trial (preferably in the morning). Assessments must be 
completed prior to IP infusion (if applicable).  
• Quality of Life  
− DMD Upper Limb Function Patient -Reported Outcome Measures ( DMD UL -
PROM )  
− Pediatric Outcomes Data  Collection Instrument (PODCI)  
− DMD Lifetime Mobility Scale (DMD -LMS)  
• Safety and other trial assessments, excluding blood and urine collections (e.g., vital 
signs, height, weight, 12- lead ECG, etc.)  
• Pulmonary function t esting  
• Performance of Upper Limb 1.2 and 2.0 
• Grip strength  
• Key and t ip-to-tip pinch  strength 
• Elbow flexion strength 
• North Star Ambulatory Assessment (ambulatory subjects only) 
• Blood and urine collections  
• Cardiac MRI  
11.2. Efficacy Assessment  Training  
Site personnel must complete trial- specific training prior to conducting efficacy assessments for 
the trial. Standardization and consistency are essential. All efforts must be made to have the same clinical evaluator s conduct the PFT; PUL ; grip, pinch, and elbow flexion strength; and NSAA 
assessments, and the same imaging technologist conduct the cardiac MRI for a subject throughout 
the duration of the trial . The clinical evaluator performing the functional assessments with the 
subject should not administer  the QOL of questionnaires to the subject . Additional details 
regarding training requirements can be found in Section  17.1 and the trial’s Manual of  Procedures 
(MOP).  
11.3. Performance of the Upper Limb  
The Performanc e of the Upper Limb was designed specifically for assessing upper limb function 
in ambulant and non- ambulant DMD patients  (Pane et al., 2014) . All the tasks included in the PUL 
were selected to address patient prioritized activities of daily living that are typical regardless of 
age, including preschool children. The PUL includes an entry item to define the starting functional 
CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 56 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   testing level  for a subject. The remaining PUL items are divided into three  regional dimensions : 
high- level (shoulder), mid- level (elbow), and distal -level (wrist and hand) . Trial subjects will 
complete testing in both the 1.2 and 2.0 modules in the same preferred arm throughout the course 
of the trial when PUL testing is required.  
Elbow contractures will be measured in each arm of a subject prior to the start of PUL testing at 
each visit that requir es testing.  
PUL equipment will be standardized across investigative sites and provided by Capricor . 
Additional details regarding the PUL requirements can be found in the trial’s MOP  and Clinical 
Evaluator Binder.  
11.4. Pulmonary Function Testing  
Pulmonary function testing (PFT) in this trial will measure slow vital capacity (SVC),  forced vital 
capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), 
maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) , peak cough flow 
(PCF), and inspiratory flow reserve (IFR) . PFTs will be performed using equipment that meets or 
exceeds the minimal performance recommendations of the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society and that will be provided by a centralized core lab .  
Site personnel must complete competency testing on a volunteer prior to conducting PFTs with a 
trial subject.  
Subjects will complete PFTs in the seated position  prior to  any other functional outcome 
measurements (i.e., PUL 1.2 & 2.0, NSAA, grip, pinch, and elbow flexion  strength, and cardiac 
MRI) . Every effort should be made to complete a subject’s PFTs at approximately the same time 
in the morning at each trial visit.  Additional details regarding each PFT technique and requirements 
are in cluded in the Site  Manual provided by the core lab. This man ual should be followed for all 
pulmonary function testing.   
11.4.1. Slow Vital Capacity  
SVC maneuvers will be performed prior to spirometry (forced maneuvers) because of the potential 
for muscular fatigue and volume history effects.  
Subjects will perform at lea st three acceptable SVC maneuvers (with no more than five  total 
attempts) until the highest SVC is no more than 0.150 L greater than the next highest measurement. 
The largest acceptable SVC value will be reported.  
11.4.2. Spirometry  
At least three acceptable spir ometry efforts (with no more than five attempts ) will be obtained for 
FEV
1, FVC , and PEF  determinations . Acceptable forced maneuvers will have a satisfactory start 
of test and end of test (i.e., a plateau in the volume -time curve) and be free from artifact s due to 
cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other 
reasons.  
Quality control standards will be implemented within a testing session. The largest FEV 1, FVC , 
and PEF  from the 3 acceptable efforts will be reported , even if they do not come from the same 
CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 57 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   effort.  The two largest accepted FVC values should be within ± 15% of each other. Additionally, 
the two largest accepted PEF values should be within ± 15% of each other.  
Subjects will complete paired spirom etry testing at screening to confirm acceptable variance in 
FVC ( exclusion criterion 7). Testing will occur on Screening Day 1 and Screening Day 2 s eparated 
by approximately 24 hours.  
11.4.3. Maximal Inspiratory & Expiratory Pressures 
Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory mouth pressure (MEP) are simple 
tests in which patients generate as much inspiratory or expiratory pressure as possibl e against a 
blocked mouthpiece. Because lung volume cannot change significantly during measurement, results are to a large extent independent of the properties of the lungs. They are general tests of neuromuscular function of the combined diaphragm, abdominal, intercostal, and accessory muscles  (Evans and Whitelaw, 2009). 
Subjects will perform the MIP maneuvers (from residual volume (RV)) first, and the MEP maneuvers (from total lung capacity (TLC)) second.  
There must be at least 3 acceptable maneuvers from a maximum of five per session.  
The two largest accepted values should be within ± 15% of each other.  
Subjects will sustain maximal efforts for a total of 3 -4 seconds until a plateau in pressure is 
achieved for at least 1.5 seconds.  Site personnel must carefully judge outlier efforts , which need to be eliminated if the pressure 
reading showed no gradual increase to the plateau value, suggesting a sharp peak value. 
11.4.4. Peak Cough Flow 
Subjects will perform a t least three cough maneuvers (with no more than five total attempts ) from 
TLC  for PCF determination. Site personnel must evaluate each maneuver to determine if it meets 
acceptability criteria. The largest , acceptable PCF value will be reported.  
11.4.5. Inspiratory Flow Reserve 
Subjects will perform at least three maximum inspiratory flow -volume maneuvers (with no more 
than five total attempts ).  From stable tidal breathing, subjects will expire to RV  and then inspire 
to TLC with maximum effort. Site personnel must evaluate each maneuver to determine if it meets 
acceptability criteria. The largest, acceptable inspiratory flow reserve value will be reported.  
11.5. Strength Testing  
Strength testing will be performed using standardized equipment that will be provided by Capricor . 
All subjects will complete  grip, pinch (tip and key), elbow flexion strength testing, regardless of 
ambulatory status, on the same side throughout the duration of the trial.  Additional details 
regarding the strength testing requirements can be found in the trial’s MOP  and Clinical  Evaluator 
Binder.

Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 58 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   11.5.1. Grip Strength  
Subjects will complete grip strength testing  in the same hand throughout the course of the trial . 
Subjects will provide maximal voluntary isometric contractions for at least three seconds. A 
subject will perform contractions until the highest observed value from a  valid effort  is within 10% 
of the next , highest valid  effort . Subjects will perform no mo re than five efforts.  The greatest value  
from a valid effort , regardless  of reproducibil ity, will be captured.  
11.5.2. Pinch Strength 
All subjects will complete “tip -to-tip” and “key” pinch strength testing, regardless of ambulatory 
status, using the same hand throughout the duration of the trial. A subject will perform pinch 
assessments for a given testing position (i.e., “tip- to-tip” or “key”) until the highest observed value 
from a  valid effort  is within 10% of the next , highest valid  effort  but, not exceeding five efforts . 
The greatest value from a valid effort for a testing position , regardless of reproducibility, will be 
captured.  
11.5.3. Elbow Flexion Strength 
All subjects will complete elbow flexion strength testing  on the same side throughout the duration 
of the trial. A subject will perform the isometric maneuver  until the highest observed value from a  
valid effort  is within 10% of the next , highest valid  effort  up to a maximum of five efforts. The 
greatest value from a valid effort, regardle ss of reproducibility, will be captured.  
11.6. North Star Ambulatory Assessment  
The NSAA is a functional scale designed specifically for ambulatory patients with DMD. Only 
ambulatory subjects – defined as those able to complete the 10MWR without assistance – will 
complete the NSAA. The scale is composed of 17 items that range from the 10MWR to rise from 
floor. Each item will be graded on a 3- point scale. The 10MWRT will be measured and recorded 
during each testing session. Additional details regarding the NSAA t esting requirements can be 
found in the trial’s MOP. 
11.7. Cardiac MRI  
Subjects will undergo cardiac MRI at the Screening, Month 6 and Month 12 visits (or, Early 
Termination Visit)  if they are physically capable as determined by an Investigator . Subjects that 
complete the cardiac MRI will have sufficient attention span, ability to maintain a breath -hold, 
lack significant contractures that would otherwise make lying flat difficult, and fit properly within the MRI scanner.  
A subject’s screening cardiac MRI case will require evaluation by a site’s  radiologist using 
institutional procedures. The reported LVEF from the local interpretation  will be used to assess 
eligibility (exclusion criterion  1). 
It is anticipated that the duration of each MRI session will be 30- 45 minutes. Acquisition 
parameters and techniques are specified in the MRI Imaging Manual. The site -based MRI 
technologists will be trained and certified in the common acquisition protocol prior to initiation of 
enrollment at each site.  All trial images and applicable imaging data will be sent to and centrally 
read at an independent, central,  imaging core by DMD cardiovascular MRI and imaging experts.

Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 59 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   Subject s that cannot  complete a cardiac MRI as part of the trial  will complete an echocardiogram 
at screening using the site’s local equipment, acquisition protocol, and evaluation  procedures . The 
reported LVEF from the local interpretation  will be used to assess eligibility (exclusion criterion  
1).    
11.8. Quality of Life Assessments  
Site personnel must complete trial- specific training prior to administering the  QOL  questionnaires 
to a trial  subject and parent/caretaker. Clinical evaluators that perform functional evaluations (e.g., 
PUL, PFTs, NSAA, and grip, pinch, and elbow flexion strength) are not to perform the QOL 
assessments. All sub jects, regardless of ambulatory status, are to complete QOL assessments at 
trial visits per Table 3 .  
11.8.1. DMD Upper Limb PROM  
The DMD Upper Limb Patient -Reported Outcome Measures (DMD UL -PROM) evaluates the 
perception of upper limb function in children and young males with DMD. The questionnair e 
consists of 32 items that cover four domains of activities of daily living: 1) food, 2) self -care, 3) 
household and environment, and 4) leisure and communication. The subject or parent /caretaker , if 
required, will evaluate the perceived difficulty in per forming the activity on a three -level scale: 
cannot do, can do with difficulty, or can do easily.  
11.8.2. DMD Life time Mobility Scale  
The Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Lifetime Mobility Scale (DMD -LMS) is  comprised of three 
sub-domains: 1) walking and moving, 2) transfers and trunk stability, and 3) carrying, moving, 
and handling objects. Each subdomain is scored out of 100 points. The questionnaire , completed 
separately by both the trial subject and parent /caretaker , facilitates patient -reported outcomes of 
function that can be combined with clinically -relative milestones  specific to patients with DMD.  
11.8.3. Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument  
The PODCI is d esigned to assess a subject’s  overall health, pain and ability to participate in normal 
daily activities, as well as in more vigorous activities  associated with young people. Eight scales 
offer a broad view of the physical, mental, and attitudinal condition for the young subject, as well 
as their treatment expectations.  
Separate subject and parent/caretaker PODCI questionnaires have been validated for pediatric 
(ages 2-11 years) and adolescent (ages 11 -18 years) subjects. The subject and parent/caretaker 
must complete the  questionnaires independently  of one another. All prompts must be answered per 
the questionnaire’s instructions. Document all reasons for refusals and non- compliance.  
11.9. Biomarkers  
The following biomarkers will be collected using standardized kits and may be batch tested at a 
designated central laboratory: 
• Muscle inflammation: osteopontin  
• Systemic inflammation: IL -1β, IL -2, IL -6, IL -10, TNF -α, and CXCL10

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   • Muscle damage: troponin I (cardiac, fast skeletal, slow skeletal), troponin T, CK -MM, 
CK-MB, creatine kinase (total), creatine phosphate, and creatinine 
• Muscle regeneration: myostatin and follistatin  
The date of each collection will be captured. Reference the Laboratory Manual  for additional 
details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of biomarker samples.  
11.10.  Exploratory Biomarkers  
For subjects who provide separate consent and/or assent, blood samples for clinical research into 
exploratory biomarkers that have not be en pre-identified will be collected, processed, and shipped 
to central lab oratory for storage and/or analysis (including an y future analysis). The date and time 
of collection will be captured. Reference the Laboratory Manual  for additional details regarding 
the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of biomarker samples.

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   12. OTHER TR IAL ASSESSMENTS  
Other trial assessments will be performed as indicated in Table 3 . 
12.1. Demographics & Baseline Characteristics  
For all subject s screened, date of birth, ethnicity, race, and dystrophin mutation type and analytical 
method will be captured. 
12.2. Medical Status Questionnaire  
Subjects will be evaluated for the following at screening and throughout the course of the trial:  
• Frequency of manual/power wheelchair use  
• Age permanently transitioned to a wheelchair full time  
• Ventilatory support 
• Frequency of falls  
Changes in ambulatory status (i.e. , transition from ambulatory to non-ambulatory) will be 
evaluated by a subject’s performance in the 10MWR as part of the NSAA.  
12.3. Medical History  
Relevant and significant medical/surgical history will be collected at Screening and updated at 
Baseline.  
12.4. Prior  and Concomitant Medications  
All medications taken within one month prior to the screening visit through trial completion will 
be captured. Medications will be reviewed at each trial visit and any medication changes, including 
new and discontinuations, will be recorded.  
For each medication, generic name, indication, dose, frequency, route, and starting and stopping 
dates/times (if applicable) will be collected. The trade name of the medication is to be reported for combination therapies (e.g., Alka- Seltzer, Advair, etc.) . 
12.5. Planned Medical/Surgical Procedures 
Data associated with any elective medical and/or surgical procedure (e.g., wisdom tooth extraction) that is not the result of an adverse event will also be captured.   
For each procedure, the type of procedure, indication, and start date/time will be recor ded. Any 
administered medication(s) related to the planned medical/surgical procedure(s) will be captured 
as a concomitant medication.  
12.6. DMD Genetic Mutation Testing  
DMD genetic testing will be available at screening for subjects who have not previously com pleted 
genetic testing or  whose historical genetic results were  not performed at a CLIA -certified 
laboratory as determined by an Investigator. The need for genetic testing should be assessed early 
CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 62 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   in the screening process, and if required, initial screening should be limited to genetic testing only 
since the turn -around time for final results may exceed the normal 30-day screening window. 
Blood samples for DMD genetic testing will be collected and analyzed at a CLIA -certified central 
laboratory. Allow 29 to 49 days for receipt of test results.

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
13.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety assessments will be performed as indicated in Table 3 . 
13.1.1. Vital Signs  
Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and blood 
oxygen saturation (SpO 2) will be measured after the subject has rested for approximately 5 minutes 
and before performing ECG and spirometry testing. A single set of values will be captured . 
A subject’s SpO 2 will be monitored for at least 30 minutes following each IP infusion (see  
Section  10.8) . 
Vital signs will be performed using equipment provided by investigative site s that has been 
properly calibrated per institutional guidelines.  
13.1.2. Weight and Height 
Weight , ulna length, and standing height measurements  will be performed.  
Investigative sites will make every effort to perform a weight measurement without the subject’s 
wheelchair or other assistive device (e.g., walker), if applicable.  
Ulna length will be measured in all subjects. Standing height will be measured if a subject is 
capable.  If standing height cannot be measured, height will be calculated using the subject’s  ulna 
length ( Gauld et al., 2004). It is critical to reduce variability in ulna length  and standing height  
measurements across investigative  sites. Therefore, s ite personnel must complete trial- specific 
training prior to measuring a subject’s  ulna length and standing height. 
Table 5: Height Calculation from Ulna Length 
Height (cm) = [4.605 x Ulna Length (cm)]  
 + [1.308 x Age (years)] 
 + 28.003  
Centimeter and year entries must include decimal 
places. If a subject is 18 years or older, enter “18” in the formula for age.  
 
13.1.3. Physical Examination 
The physical exam (PE) is not considered a standard of care assessment as the examiner will be 
assessing f or research events. Therefore, the physical exam is to be conducted only by an 
Investigator, or designated site personnel  (e.g., nurse practitioners, physician assistants, research 
fellows) listed on the Delegation of Authority Log.    
The physical examination will be a review of the major organ systems including:  general 
appearance, HEENT, lymphatic, respiratory, cardiovascular, chest, abdomen, gastrointestinal, and 
musculoskeletal .

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   Clinically significant findings prior to investigational product administration are to be captured as 
medical history.  
Clinically s ignificant findings after the start of investigational product administration are captured 
and reported as AEs, if they meet the definition of an AE per Section  13.2.1. 
13.1.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
All ECG measurements will be obtained  in the supine position with standardized equipment that 
meet institutional standards for clinical use . Site personnel must complete trial- specific training 
prior to ECG measurements. A 12 -lead ECG measurement and rhythm strip (10 seconds) will be 
obtained after measurement of vital signs and before spirometry testing.  The Investigator, a designated Sub-I nvestigator, or other appropriately trained site personnel will 
be responsible for performing 12- lead ECG assessments. The I nvestigator must provide his/her 
dated signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticity of the ECG machine 
interpretation , or their over- read and reinterpretation . 
ECG data will be el ectronically transmitted to an independent cardiologist, contracted by Capricor , 
and evaluated. The independent cardiologist, blinded to treatment assignment, will conduct an over- read of the ECG measurements r equired for the trial. Investigative sites will receive a report 
with the independent cardiologist’s ECG interpretations that must be reviewed, signed, and dated by an Investigator.  
13.1.5. Immunologic Assessment s 
Serum for DSA testing  and whole blood for HLA typing will be collected  at each site at baseline , 
and then shipped to a central laboratory for analysis (See Laboratory Manual for shipping 
instructions).  
DSA collections at the Week 4 (±7 days) visit and  14-30 days prior to the planned date of the 
second, third, and fourth IP infusions will be assessed  to determine MCB lot compatibility . These 
follow- up collections will occur either at the investigative site or remotely at a designated central 
laboratory patient service center.  
DSA samples may also be collected  in the setting of clinical suspicion of immune sensitization 
syndrome in the judgment of the Investigator. See  Section  7.2.1 for additional details regarding 
immune sensitization syndrome as a safety endpoint.  
13.1.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All blood samples are to be collected following the standard institutional procedures for blood and 
urine collection and submitted to a central laboratory for analysis.  
Instructions on collection, processing, storage and shipping the samples to the central laboratory 
are located in the Laboratory Manual.  
13.1.6.1. Hematology 
Hematologic al testing will include complete blood count ( CBC) with white blood cell ( WBC ) 
differential, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet count

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   13.1.6.2. Serum  Chemistry  
Serum  chemistry testing will include: basic metabolic panel (Glucose, Sodium, Potassium, 
Chloride, Bicarbonate, BUN, Creatinine, Calcium), comprehensive hepatic panel (Albumin, 
Alkaline Phosphatase, Total Protein, ALT, AST, GGT, Direct Bilirubin, Total Bilirubin) , and 
Creatine Kinase  
13.1.6.3. Urinalysis  
Analytes that will be tested  include : appearance, bilirubin, color, nitrite, occult blood, pH, protein, 
specific gravity, glucose, ketones, red blood cell ( RBC) , and WBC. If required, micros copic 
analysis of sediment will be performed and reported per occurrence.  
13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
13.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
13.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. It may be indicated by physical sign, symptom, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, and/or disease temporally associated with a medical (investigational) 
treatment, procedure, or product, whether or not related to the medical (investigational treatment, procedure or product.  This definition includes intercurrent illnesses or injuries, exacerbation of pre-existing conditions, or events occurring due to abuse or overdose.   
Any condition that was pre -existing is not an adverse event unless there is a change in the nature, 
severity, or degree of the condition.  
Clinical laboratory abnormalities are considered AEs when deemed clinically significant by the 
Investigator and/or lead to a change in the subject’s functional status.  
An AE does not include:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., colonoscopy, biopsy). The medical condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
• Social or convenience hospital admissions where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur. 
• Day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the 
start of the trial that do not worsen. 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition. 
All Investigators conducting investigative studies supported by Capricor  must report both expected 
and unexpected SAEs  to Capricor , or designee, and their individual Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) in compliance with their institutional policies. Please see Section  13.2.4 or further details 
on event reporting.  
CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 67 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   Other risks of the infusion procedure include those risks that are possible with the intravenous 
administration. These include risks related to infection, bleeding, pain, and bruising and/or 
hematoma at the vascular access site(s).   
13.2.1.4. Unexpected Adverse Events  
An AE  is considered “unexpected” if it i s not listed in the Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed, if the Investigator ’s Brochure is not required 
or available, or if it is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator ’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Expedited reporting is required for serious unexpected AEs as discussed in Section  13.2.4.   
13.2.1.5. Other Adverse Event (OAE)  
OAEs will be identified by the Medical Monitor during the evaluation of safety data for the planned 
interim analysis and Clinical Study Report.  Significant adverse events of particular clinical 
importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to discontinuation of the subject from the trial, will be classified as OAEs.   
For each OAE, a narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report. 
13.2.2. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The Investigator will assess the relationship (causality) of an  AE to the investigational product and 
administration procedure.  
Causality will be defined as follows:  
• Probable : adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, are considered with a 
high degree of certainty to be related to the investigational pr oduct or administration 
procedure. The following characteristics will apply:  
− A reasonable temporal relationship exists between the event and the investigational 
product or administration procedure, and 
− The event is a known reaction to the investigational product or administration 
procedure, which cannot be explained by an alternative etiology commonly 
occurring in the population/individual.  
• Possible : adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria 
for a probable relationship to the investigational product or administration procedure, but for which a connection has reasonable certainty. The following characteristics apply:  
− The event occurs after exposure to the investigational product or administration procedure, and  
CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 68 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   − The event is not a known reaction to the investigational product or administration 
procedure, but cannot be explained by a commonly occurring alternative etiology, 
or 
− In the absence of a temporal relationship, the event cannot reasonably be explained by an alternative etiology.  
• Unlikely : adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria 
for possible or probable relationship to investigational product or administration procedure and for which a connection is unlikely. The f ollowing characteristics will 
apply:  
− The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product or administration procedure, or  
− May be explained by commonly occurring alternative etiology in the 
population/individual, or  
− May have been produced by environmental factors, and there is no apparent pattern 
of response to the investigational product or administration procedure.  
An adverse event will be reported as “related” when causality is evaluated by an Investigator as 
probably or possibly related  to the investigational product and/or the administration procedure. 
Related adverse events indicate a potential cause- and-effect relationship between the 
investigational product and/or administration procedure and t he occurrence of the adverse event.  
An adverse event will be reported as “unrelated” when causality is evaluated by an Investigator as 
unlikely related to the investigational product and/or administration procedure by the Investigator. 
Unrelated adverse events indicate no relationship between the occurrence of the adverse event and the investigational product and/or administration procedure.  
13.2.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators will monitor all subjects for AEs during the trial and establish a diagnosis  for an 
event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. It is important to distinguish 
that individual signs and symptoms of the event are not adverse events and should not be reported.  
For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate the ca usality and severity, report the action taken and 
event outcome and disclose whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue trial participation . 
The following severity scale will be used as a guideline to differentiate the severity of adverse events:   
• Mild (Grade 1) : Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
• Moderate (Grade 2) : Mild to moderate limitation in activity – some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy requi red 
• Severe (Grade 3) : Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required and often requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 69 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   • Life-Threatening or D isabling (Grade 4):  Extreme limitation in activity, significant 
assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required; hospitalization, 
prolongation of hospitalization, or hospice care 
• Fatal (Grade 5) 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event. An event is described as “serious” when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes noted in Section  13.2.1.2. Both an AE and SAE can be assessed as 
severe. However, an AE of severe intensity may not meet SAE definition requirements.  
13.2.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
All adverse events are collected from the time of signing informed consent for trial participation 
until completion of 12 months or early termination, whichever occurs first. All AEs occurring after 
the initiation of the IV catheter placement for the initial dose of IP will be considered treatmen t 
emergent. Any ongoing adverse event that has not been resolved at the time of trial completion or 
early termination for a subject will be marked as ongoing on the adverse event case report form (CRF).  
All AEs will be entered into the electronic data cap ture (EDC) system by trained site personnel at 
the investigative site.   
Expected and unexpected SAEs must be reported to Capricor and entered into the EDC system 
within 24 hours of discovery of the event. For events that do not have complete information available at the time of initial report, the investigative site will submit all available information at 
the time of the submission. All SAE Report Forms must be signed by an I nvestigator and submitted 
with available source documentation. All source documentation must be de -identified prior to 
submission.  
Should access to the EDC system be unavailable, SAE s and subsequent follow -up information 
must be reported to Capricor , or designee, via: 
• Email:  
• Fax:  
All SAEs must be reported to the respective IRB in accordance with the investigative site’s 
policies. Copies of the submission will be collected by Capricor.   
All SAEs will be reported to the DSMB at least semi-annually, or more frequently at the discretion 
of the M edical Monitor.  
Capricor will promptly upon discovery, report serious and unexpected adverse events for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that the investigative therapy (i.e. administration product and/ or 
investigative product) caused the events, to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 regulations and ICH E2A guidelines.  
For trials conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application, FDA regulations require 
reporting of any serious suspected adverse reaction  that is unexpected according to the current 
Investigator’s Brochure. A serious adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there 
is a reasonable possibility that the drug/biologic caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal re lationship 

CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 70 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   between the drug/biologic and the adverse event. Serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) are SAEs that are unexpected and are possibly or probably related to participation in 
the research. Expedited reporting is required for all  SUSARs . Capricor will send an IND Safety 
Report to the FDA within 7 calendar days of receipt for fatal/life -threatening events, and within 
15 calendar days of receipt for non- fatal/non -life-threatening events that  qualify for expedited 
reporting.  
13.2.5. Pregnancy Reporting  
Should a female be impregnated by a trial subject, investigative sites are required to notify Capricor  
within 24 hours of learning about the pregnancy. The investigative site will receive the Pregn ancy 
Reporting Form to complete and submit to Capricor, or designee.  
All pregnancies will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known. In addition, pregnancies 
that are ongoing at the time of trial comple tion will be followed until the outcome is known. The 
investigative site is responsible for outcome reporting via the Pregnancy Reporting Form , 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of 
any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications.     
The pregnancy is not an adverse event for the male subject unless there is a suspicion that the 
investigational product interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
13.2.6. Adverse Event Follow -up 
All AEs are followed by the investigative site until an outcome is known or the subject’s 
participation in the trial concludes at either 12 months or early termination, whichever occurs first.  
The investigative site is expected t o review all ongoing AEs at each visit. AEs are followed until 
resolution or until no further changes in the event are expected (i.e., the point at which a subject experiencing an AE is treated successfully and stabilized even though he may continue to experience lingering sequelae that may never resolve), or it is agreed that further follow -up of the 
event is not warranted (e.g., non-serious, IP unrelated, ongoing at final visit).  
For SAEs that were incomplete or ongoing at the time of initial submission, the investigative site 
is required to submit follow -up SAE Report Forms when event information is available to the 
research site personnel and/or an outcome is known.

14.1. General Considerations  
The objectives of the trial are to evaluate the s afety and efficacy of intravenous infusions of CAP -
1002 administered in four doses at 3-month intervals  in subjects with DMD and impairment of 
skeletal muscle function. All statistical tests will be two -sided with 0.05 significance levels. The 
detailed des cription of the trial statistical methods is provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). Any deviations from the SAP will be described and justified in the final Clinical Study 
Report. 
14.2. Sample Size  
This trial will be limited to a total of 20 randomized subjects.  
14.3. Analysis Population  
The following analysis populations will be defined for the trial: 
Safety Population: Subjects who received IP. Safety endpoints for s ubjects will be summarized 
and analyz ed according to the treatment actually received.  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population: Subjects who were randomized. Subjects will be summarized 
and analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized. 
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population : For each efficacy parameter, the mITT population 
will include subjects in the ITT population who have at least a baseline observation (i.e., mITT populations are parameter -specific). Subjects will be summarized and analyzed in the treatment 
group to which they were randomized. 
Per Protocol Population: Subjects who received IP with no protocol deviations/ violations that 
could significantly impact the completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the trial data. The list of subjects in the per protocol population will be compiled prior to database lock. 
14.4. Safety Analysis 
Safety parameters will be listed, summarized and, if applicable, analyzed for the safety population.  
There are no formal tests of hypotheses associated with the evaluation of safety endpoints.  
14.4.1. Safet y Endpoints  
The incidence of the  following events through the 12- month timepoint will be primary safety 
endpoints : 
• Acute respiratory decompensation within 2 hours following IP administration 
• Hypersensitivity reaction  
• All-cause mortality  
• Serious adverse events 
• Treatment -emergent adverse events related to IP or administration procedure  
CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 72 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   • Immune sensitization  syndrome 
The incidence and severity of all AEs will be evaluated as the secondary safety endpoint . 
Treatment groups will be summarized and compared by the  incidence of each event type and by 
the subject  event rate. Safety during the study will be monitored by the independent, unblinded 
DSMB. See Section  13.2 for more detail on AE data collection and processing. 
14.4.2. Adverse Events  
Directly observed and spontaneously reported AEs will be recorded from time of signing informed 
consent (SAEs only) through the end of the trial. AEs will be coded using MedDRA® (Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities), in which each reported event is mapped to a Preferred Term 
(PT) and a System Organ Class (SOC). A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) will be defined as an 
AE that was not present prior to the initiation of line placement procedure for the IP infusion or 
was present but worsened in intensity or frequency. All reported AEs will be listed. Both TEAEs 
and non- TEAEs will be summarized, overall and by severity and relationship to the IP and IP 
administration procedure. For each SOC and PT within SOCs, the numbers and percentages of 
subjects reporting an event as well as the number of events that were reported will be calculated. 
Deaths, AEs that resulted in trial discontinuation, SAEs, and AEs within 24 hours of IP  
administration will be listed and summarized separately.  
14.4.3. Medications  
Prescription, over -the- counter, and alternative medication use will be coded to drug class, 
preferred drug name, and generic/trade drug name using the World Health Organization drug 
dictionary (WHO -DD). Medications that were stopped before the start of the IP administration 
procedure will be considered “pre -treatment.” All other medications will be considered 
“concomitant.” Medications that were started or ongoing at the time the IP admi nistration 
procedure was started will be considered “baseline” (a subset of “concomitant”). All reported medications will be listed. Frequencies and percentages of subjects reporting or receiving each 
medication will be summarized by WHO -DD drug class and preferred name within drug class. 
Pre-treatment and baseline medications will be summarized separately. Separate listings and 
summaries will also be done for cardiac medications and for glucocorticoids.  
14.4.4. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Laboratory evaluations will be listed and summarized by visit within each panel (e.g., chemistry, 
hematology, etc.). Summary tables will show means of observed values and changes from baseline for observations on a continuous scale and distributions of categorical observations. Shift tables 
may be produced that show frequencies and percentages of subjects that shift from one out -of-
range category at baseline to another out-of-range category at subsequent visits.  
14.4.5. Donor- Specific Antibodies  
Donor, donor profile, allele, and MFI will by listed by HLA and visit. Subject HLA profiles will 
be provided in a separate listing.  
DSA data will be analyzed in the context of immune sensitization syndrome should there be an 
occurrence.

Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential  14.4.6. Physical Examination 
Observed status (e.g., normal, abnormal) and changes from baseline in body system -specific 
physical examination findings will be summarized by visit within each body system.  
14.4.7. 12-Lead ECG, Vital Signs, and Weight 
Observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized by visit. 
14.5. Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated in the ITT population, with supportive analyses 
in the mITT and PP populations.  Secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be evaluated 
in the PP population.  
14.5.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline to Month 12 in the mid -level (elbow) 
dimension of the PUL 1.2. The hypothesis set to be tested is: 
Ho:  µ c - µ p = 0 
Ha:  µ c - µ p ≠ 0 
where µ c and µ p are population mean absolute changes from baseline in CAP -1002- and placebo-
treated patients, respectively.  
14.5.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Supportive secondary efficacy endpoints will be change from baseline in: 
•Mid-level (elbow) PUL 1.2 at Months 3, 6, and 9;
•Regional systolic LV wall thickening at Months 6 and 12
14.5.3. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be change from baseline in: 
•High -level (shoulder) dimension of the PUL 1.2 at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12;
•High -level (shoulder) dimensions of the PUL 2.0 at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12;
•Mid-level (elbow) dimensions of the PUL 2.0 at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12;
•Distal-level (wrist and hand) dimensions of the PUL 1.2 at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12;
•Distal- level (wrist and han d) dimensions of the PUL 2.0 at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12;
•Grip strength, absolute and percent predicted , at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12;
•Tip-to-tip pinch strength, absolute and percent predicted at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12;

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   • PODCI scales (subject and parent) at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12; 
• DMD-LMS at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12; 
• NSAA at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12; 
• 10MWRT at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12; 
• Incidence of loss of ambulation (10MWRT > 30 seconds) at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12; 
• Pulmonary function tests (absolute and pe rcent predicted  [if available] ) at Months 3, 6, 
9, and 12; 
• LV st ructure and function as assessed by cardiac MRI at Months 6 and 12; 
• Biomarkers, which may include osteopontin, IL -1ß, IL -2, IL -6, IL -10, TNF -α, 
CXCL10, troponin I  (cardiac, fast skeletal, slow skeletal) , troponin T, CK -MM, CK-
MB, creatine kinase (total), c reatine phosphate, creatinine, myostatin, and follistatin  at 
Months 3, 6, 9, and 12; 
• Resource utilization, including hospitalizations for orthopedic injury or surgery and for 
pulmonary infections, over the course of the trial. 
14.6. Statistical Methods  
Comparisons between treatment groups on efficacy endpoints will be done using repeated 
measures linear models. Other analyses may also be done using appropriate parametric or non-
parametric methods, depending on distributions of the data and whether or not model as sumptions 
are met. An algorithm detailing the decision -making process for performing the primary efficacy 
analysis, in light of features of the data that cannot be known until the data are observed (e.g., outliers), will be detailed in the SAP.  
14.6.1. Multiplicit y 
Trial -wise type 1 error is controlled at the 0.05 level by declaring a primary efficacy endpoint. All 
other efficacy parameter s are either supportive secondary or exploratory endpoints and there will 
be no adjustment for multiple analyses. 
14.6.2. Missing Data  
Subject -level listings will present data as reported. Missing or partially missing dates that are 
required for date -dependent definitions (eg, treatment -emergent AEs, concomitant medications) 
will be assumed to be the most conservative date possible. For example, an AE with a completely 
missing start date will be considered treatment- emergent; similarly, an AE that started the same 
month and year as IP administration but with missing start day will be considered treatment-emergent.  
Multiple imputation  methods will be used for missing observations for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, if required to prevent subjects from being excluded entirely from analysis.

15.1. Steering Committee
The Steering Committee will provide the overall scientific direction for the trial. The 
responsibilities of the Steering Committee are to: (a) maintain contact with trial I nvestigators to 
ensure high quality data collection; (b) approve and implement major protocol changes; (c) 
collaborate in data anal ysis, interpretations, and publications; (d) establish criteria for authorship 
on all manuscripts, publications and presentations that arise from the trial.  
15.2. Clinical Events Committee (CEC)  
The purpose of CEC adjudication is to provide consistent and unbia sed adjudication of clinical 
outcomes and specified events through the independent review of source documentation. The charge of the CEC is to review source documents and to adjudicate the classifications of all 
potential primary safety endpoint events. Si tes will be provided instructions in the MOP on how 
to collect and submit event information required for CEC review . The CEC will remain blinded to 
subject treatment assignments .  The individuals that serve on the committee will be appointed by 
Capricor , are independent from all other trial activities , and are not affiliated with any investigative 
site. The committee will consist of, at a minimum, a neurologist and pulmonologist with experience in treating patients with DMD. Additional experts in immunology will be consultants 
to the committee as necessary. The frequency of CEC meetings is detailed in the CEC Charter.  
15.3. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
To meet the trial's ethical responsibility to its subjects, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will monitor results during the trial.  The board consists of physicians and biostatistician(s) appointed by Capricor , who have no formal involvement or conflict of interest with the 
Investigators, investigative sites, subjects, or Capricor . The DSMB will act in a senior advisory 
capacity to Capricor  regarding data and safety matters throughout the duration of the trial. The 
board will meet on a periodic basis according to the DSMB charter to monitor the available 
information regarding safety, efficacy, and qua lity of trial conduct. The DSMB will communicate 
their recommendations directly to Capricor . The investigative sites will have no contact with the 
members of DSMB and no voting member of the committee may parti cipate in the trial as an 
Investigator.

16.1. Electronic Data Capture  
All trial data will be entered into the EDC system. Site personnel requiring access will have their 
own Login/Password. Access to trial information will be bas ed on individual roles and 
responsibilities. The application employs fine -grained role -based access control for data entry, 
viewing and reporting options. All trial data will be transmitted over an encrypted SSL (Secure 
Sockets Layer) connection that requires user authentication.  
This application is designed to be in full compliance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization and Good Clinical Practices (ICH -GCP), the FDA’s CFR 21 Part 11 Electronic 
Record and Electronic Signatures, the FDA’s “Guidance: Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Studie s,” and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ).  
EDC supports efficient data collection and ma nagement and facilitates rapid data closure. A strong 
advantage of web -based design is that Capricor , or designee, has immediate access to the data from 
all investigative sites so that queries can be generated and distributed to the sites in real -time and 
the frequency of missing data can be reduced.     
16.2. Trial  Monitoring  
In accordance with 21 CFR 312.56, ICH - GCP, and local regulations, trial monitors will 
periodically complete  on-site monitoring of data with a focus on safety, trial endpoints, data 
completion, data outliers and data integrity. Trial monitors  will schedule an on- site visit with a site 
coordinator for an appropriate duration based on the scope of data anticipated to be collected. Prior 
to the visi t, a confirmation letter will be sent to the investigative site, which will include a listing 
of which CRFs and source documents will be reviewed.  
Site coordinators are to have all source documents up to date and easily accessible to a monitor.      Durin g an on- site monitoring visit, trial monitors  are to:  
• Track the overall monitoring process including data collected and entered, visit 
schedules, and subject screening and enrollment. 
• Verify and ensure compliance with the protocol according to GCP and HIP AA 
requirements.  
• Ensure that appropriate data corrections are made, dated, explained, and initialed by 
the Investigator or representative.  
• Assess the impact of any personnel changes on the investigative site’s ability to conduct the trial.  
• Verify a minimu m of the following data points for all subjects: date of birth, signed 
informed consent, eligibility criteria, medical history, date of enrollment, serious AEs, and mortalities.  
• Perform review of informed consent process and review documentation of inform ed 
consent for completeness and correctness.

 Page 78 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   • Perform on -site validation checks of recoded data by reviewing source documents to 
determine whether the data reported in the EDC system are complete and accurate. 
Source documents include medical charts, scree ning records and/or logs, research 
procedure records and/or files, and other trial related notes.  
• Monitor subject safety by verifying that any AE, therapy modification, or concomitant medications are reported in accordance with the protocol.  
• Determine whether all AEs, protocol deviations, and protocol violations are appropriately reported within the required time periods according to applicable regulatory requirements as outlined in the protocol and by regulatory agencies.  
• Verify that any missed visits, tests, and examinations that were not performed, as well as trial withdrawals and/or dropouts are explained and clearly reported. 
• Inform the site PI about any deviations from or violations of the trial  protocol, GCP 
and/or regulatory requirements in order for appropriate actions to be taken to prevent recurrence of the deviation and/or violation.  
• Infor  the Investigator of any major data entry error, delays in data entry, omissions, or 
eligibility requirement errors.  
• Verify that regulatory documentation is accurate, complete, current, and properly maintained.  
• Very that PI oversight of trial conduct is documented via signature or initials and date 
on documentation regarding eligibility, AEs, and abnormal laboratory values.  
The monitor may also inspect the investigative site’s facilities to verify that proper space for study documents, equipment and investigational product is available.  
A debriefing meeting with the PI, site coordinator (s), and the M onitor to review any notable 
findings will be scheduled toward the end of the on- site visit. The monitor will submit a written 
monitoring visit report to Cap ricor and send a follow -up letter with findings to the PI. The report 
and letter will include a summary of documentation reviewed by the monitor, any significant 
findings, AEs, protocol deviations and violations, missing regulatory documents and actions ta ken, 
to be taken or recommended to ensure compliance. The report and letter will include a list of action 
items. Investigative sites are expected to complete the list of actions items within 30 days of 
receipt.  
16.2.1. Source Document Requirements  
It is highly recommended that the investigative site uses the CRFs and schedule of assessments 
(Table 3 ) to develop a plan for identifying and standardizing where source documentation for data 
verification will be collected across all trial participants at their site. As part of trial  start-up and 
prior to first enrollment, investigative sites are encouraged to conduct a gap analysis to identify 
any data points that are not routinely documented in the medical record.  
The medical record is the gold standard for source documentation. However, Capricor  understands 
that there may be data points required for this trial  that are not collected as routine practice at the 
investigative site in the medical record for this patient population. Investigative sites may use the 
provided source document worksheets or create source documents for the purposes of collecting 
CAP -1002- DMD- 02  Allogeneic Cardiosphere -Derived Cells  
Protocol Amendment 5 .0  27-Sep-2019  
 Page 79 of 117  
 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   source data that are not included in the medical record. It is important to remember that “source” 
documentation is where the information is first recorded.  
The investigative site must ensure that all subject so urce documentation is complete, orderly, and 
stored in a secure location. For electronic records, the investigative site should abide by the 
institutional policies for the storage of private health information (PHI). For any paper records 
containing any PHI, the investigative sites must ensure that the files are double -locked, that is, in 
a locked filing cabinet within a locked office or suite.  
All source documentation is to be de -identified of all unique patient and hospital identifiers by the 
investigative site prior to review or submission to Capricor  or their designee. 
16.3. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Capricor , a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics Committee 
or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including 
source data verification.  The purpose of a  Capricor  audit or inspection is to systematica lly and 
independently examine all trial- related activities and documents to determine whether these 
activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The Investigator should contact Capricor  
immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection. 
16.4. Retention of Re cords  
The investigative sites must maintain all documentation relating to the trial  for a period of two 
years after the last marketing application approval, or if not approved, two  years following the 
discontinuance of the test article for investigation.  If it becomes necessary for Capricor or the 
Regulatory Authority to review any documentation relating to the trial, the Investigator must 
permit access to such records.

A representative o f Capricor, or designee, will visit the investigative site  to determine adequacy of 
the facilities and discuss the feasibility of conducting the trial. 
Clinical Investigators will be physicians with expertise in the clinical care of patients with DMD 
in a multi- disciplinary clinical setting that includes neuromuscular medicine, pulmonary, 
cardiology, and physical therapy.   Each investigative site MRI lab involved in image acquisition for this trial will be certified by the 
MRI core lab in accordance with t he MRI Imaging Manual.  
Each investigative site pulmonary function testing lab involved in conducting pulmonary function testing for this trial will be certified by the Pulmonary Function Core Lab as detailed in the Manual 
of Procedures.   
Investigative site personnel delegated to perform the ECG assessment will be certified to perform 
and transmit the assessment by a centralized vendor.   
All Investigators and coordinators will be trained by Capricor , or designee, in the specifics of the 
protocol, investigational product and administration procedure at the site initiation visit in advance 
of the first subject  enrollment. The Investigators and coordinators will also undergo a separate 
training to gain familiarity with the electronic data capture system.   
17.2. Good Clinical Practices (GCP)  
All Investigators, coordinators and other site  personnel involved in care of trial subjects , and/or 
research data collection must provide certification that they have successfully completed their institutionally required GCP or other Human Subject Protection courses.  Please refer to Section 
6.2 of the Manual of Procedures for specific details regarding certification requirements.  
17.3. HIPAA or Other Privacy Training  
All Investigators and coordinators must provide documentation that they have successfully 
completed the institutional requirements to ensure subject  rights, privacy and security under 
HIPAA.  
17.4. Site Initiation  
IRB approval and the clinical trial agreement between  the investigative site and Capricor must be 
signed and executed prior to the site initiation. Additionally, the completed Form FDA 1572, applicable CVs and other regulatory documents must be on file with Capricor prior to site 
initiation. A representative  from Capricor, or designee, will conduct a site initiation prior to 
enrollment of the first subject. Investigators, study coordinator(s), investigational pharmacist (s),

be required to attend the initiation. All other site personnel who may be involved in the trial will 
be encouraged to attend.  
17.5. Protocol Deviations 
Efforts to maximize adhere nce to the protocol will be made through careful and comprehensive 
training, review of trial data collected via the EDC, and routine communication with all site 
Investigators.    
All protocol deviations and violations are to be documented and captured in the EDC. The 
investigative site is responsible for reporting deviations and violations to the IRB per the IRB’s 
reporting guidelines. Capricor  will ensure reporting to the proper local and federal r egulatory 
authorities in accordance with all applicable federal and local regulations.  
Capricor  will determine the course of action based on the severity of the deviation or violation. 
These may include but ar e not limited to, withdrawal of the subject, additional training at the site, 
additional site monitoring, and/or other appropriate courses of action.  In addition, the Medical 
Monitor and biostatistician will review the circumstances of each deviation and violation (in a 
blinded fashion) to determine whether data can reasonably be included in any trial analyses.

18.1. Ethics Review  
Investigative sites are required to follow their institutional guidelines for obtaining initial approval 
by the IRB and for submitting continuing reviews to the IRB. Subject enrollment at an investigative 
site will not commence until initial IRB approval documentation has been received and reviewed 
by Capricor. The composition and conduct of this committee must conform to the Uni ted States 
CFR and ICH  E6.  
The informed consent must be reapproved in accordance with the investigative site’s IRB policies or at least annually.  
Capricor will provide the investigative sites with DSMB approval letters, serious adverse drug 
reactions and  any other applicable correspondences during the trial. Investigative sites are to 
follow their institutional policies for reporting these correspondences and documents to their IRB.  
All IRB approvals and all materials approved/acknowledged by the IRB for  this trial, including 
the subject consent/assent form, recruitment materials, or safety event notifications, must be 
maintained by the Investigator and made available for inspection. 
18.2. Ethical Conduct of the Trial  
The trial will be performed in accordance w ith ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. Please reference Section  17 further information.  
In accordance with FDA regulatory requirements, 21 CFR 54.4, the I nvestigators at each site will 
be required to complete a financial disclosure form provided by Capricor  prior to participation in 
the trial. Each Investigator shall provide Capricor  sufficient accurate financial information to allow 
Caprico r to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements (Forms 3454 
and/or 3455) as required by the FDA regulations. Investigators shall promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur in the course of the trial or for 1 year  following 
completion of the trial 
18.3. Written Informed Consent  and Assent  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the informed consent process is conducted and 
documented appropriately by trained site personnel. A signed informed consent, which has been approved by Capricor and the individual site IRB, is required for trial participation. The consent 
form must incorporate a clinical research authorization for use and disclosure of private health 
information and a release of medical information that a uthorizes release of medical records to the 
trial I nvestigators, monitors, and Capricor. The Investigator, or designated and qualified 
individual, will provide a thorough explanation of objectives, subject responsibilities, risks and 
benefits of the trial, and will fully address all concerns raised by the subject and/or legal guardian. 
After all issues have been adequately resolved, and the I nvestigator confirms that the subject  has 
been fully consented, the subject  or his legal guardian will be asked to si gn the informed consent. 
The consent process must be documented in the medical chart and a signed copy of the consent 
and/or assent must be given to the subject  and/or legal guardian.

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   18.3.1. Obtaining Informed Consent and Assent  
The Investigators at each center will ensure that the subject and legal guardian (applicable only if 
the subject is < 18 years of age) are given full and adequate oral and written information about the 
nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the trial.  The s ubject and legal guardian must also be 
notified that they are free to discontinue from the trial  at any time.  The subject and legal guardian 
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. 
The subject must sign and date the  informed consent form prior to performing any trial procedures. 
If the subject is < 18 years of age, the subject must sign and date the assent form and a legal 
guardian must sign and date the informed consent form prior to performing any trial  procedures.  
Specific requirements and guidelines for providing assent will be determined by the investigative 
site’s IRB.   
18.4. Subject Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of all subject records will be maintained according to HIPAA guidelines. Investigators, investigative site IRBs, Capricor, CEC, and the FDA may review source 
documentation for enrolled subject s as necessary, but all unique patient and hospi tal identifiers 
will be removed prior to review. If the results of this trial are published, the data will be presented 
in aggregate, with all subject identifiers removed.

Recognizing the importance of communicating clinical trial results to the public and the medical 
and scientific communities in an accurate and complete manner, the first publication of the trial, 
to include results from all of the investigative centers in a multi- center publication, will be authored 
by the lead or national Principal Investigator, and/or other designees assigned by the S teering 
Committee, for publication in a peer -reviewed scientific journal. All participating Investigators, 
key site personnel, committees and committee members will be listed in an appendix as part of the main manuscript.  
An individual Investigator has the right to publish his/her data after the multi -center publication, 
unless no such multi -center publication is so published before the first anniversary of the 
finalization of the multi- center database, in which case the Investigator may publish or submit for 
publication a manuscript without further delay according to the terms and conditions in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  
Additional manuscripts targeting  exploratory endpoints or other endpoints or data not included in 
the first multi- center publication are anticipated and encouraged. In such cases, the Investigator(s) 
should submit ideas for these additional manuscripts to t he Steering Committee that will serve as 
the clearing house to approve topics, ensure that activity between the I nvestigator(s) in analyzing 
the data is coordinated, prioritize data analyses and help determine authorship.

 Capricor, Inc. - Company Confidential   21.2. Appendix II: Pre-Infusion Guidance for Minimizing Risk of Potential 
Severe Hypersensiti vity Reaction    
As discussed in Section 10.6, Capricor requires treatment of all subjects prior to each IP infusion 
to minimize the risk of a  potential severe allergic reaction. It is strongly encouraged that pre -
medication be administered according to the guidelines in Table 6 including the administration of 
high dose steroids, H1 and H2 blockers ; however, i nvestigative sites may use institutional 
protocols established for anaphylaxis prevention should they be at least physiologically 
comparable to the guidelines below.   
Final decisions regarding t he medication (s), dose (s) administered,  and route (s) of administration  
are to be determined by the I nvestigator taking into consideration the subject’s medical history. 
For any pre -treatment medication administered , the FDA approved label should be reviewed for 
information on potential side effects and/or drug interactions and followed for detailed instructions 
on weight-based dosing. Of note, for subjects routinely treated with beta blocker and ACEi , the doses of both should be 
held on the day of infusion, if clinically acceptable in the judgment of the site Investigator. 
Furthermore, it is recommended that the s tanding steroid doses s hould be held if the planned 
schedule is within 24 hours of the time of scheduled infusion of IP. This is because glucocorticoids 
will likely  be administered as part of the pre -medications  beginning 12 – 14 hours prior to infusion 
of IP.

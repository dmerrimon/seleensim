________________________________________ 
The primary changes implemented in this protocol amendment  are due to a recent surge in 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) cases at  one of the clinical sites  enrolling subjects in  
Protocol Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 2 of 11 this study. Between Day -2 and Day 9 there were 21 subjects at the site who tested positive 
for COVID -19. To protect the safety of the subjects and site personnel, all 35 subjects  at the 
site were discharged from the unit and were discontinued from the study following 
completion of the Early Termination assessments. Subjects will be monitored as outlined in 
the protocol. 
As a result of this outbreak, the protocol ha s been  modified to allow time for the sites to 
perform additional COVID-19 tests and confirm results prior to enrolling the subjects in the 
study.  The sites may bring in subjects for c heck -in on Day -4 rather than Day  -2, if necessary.  
In addition, the number of subjects planned to be randomiz ed in the study was increased from 
64 to 68 subjects to ensure an adequate number of evaluable subjects are randomized to meet 
the objectives of the study. 
Minor changes:  
1. The protocol version and date were updated throughout the protocol. 
2. Typographical errors and formatting errors were corrected, as necessary.  
3. List of abbreviations was revised, as necessary.  
A detailed summary of changes is presented below:  
Synopsis and Section 3.1, Overall Study Design  paragraphs 3 and 7 ( including Figure 1)

Section 7, Study Assessments and Procedures  
Previously read:  
This study includes a screening period (Day -28 to Day -3), a treatment period (Days -2 to 
19), and a follow-up period (Day 29 ±2 days ).  
The defined abnormal vital sign measurements (Exclusion Criteria #4) at check -in (Day - 2) 
or baseline (Day -1 predose) will only be considered exclusionary if jud ged applicable by the 
investigator. For confirmation of enrollment eligibility based on pulse rate, the pulse rate assessed by vital signs, rather than the 12-lead ECG, will be used. For all subjects, the screening, check -in, or baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate may be 
repeated after 5 to 10  minutes if the initial reading is believed to be atypical for the subject.

dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day - 1. Replicate 12 -lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1,
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. At timepoints for ECG extractions, subjects will be supinely resting in  an undisturbed environment. The ECG effects
of CBP -307 will be tested on data fro m Day -1 (baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo), and Day 15 (supratherapeutic
concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be tested on data from Days -1, 1, 15, and 16.
6.Serum pregnancy tes t will be performed at screening and urine pregnancy tests will be performed on Day - 2 and at the follow -up visit (Day 29±2 days). A positive urine
pregnancy test will be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.
7.Pharmacokinetic samplings will be performed prior to dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day (Days 1, 6, 15, and 16).
Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15.
8.Allowable assessment/sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5 hours postdose, ±5 minutes for 1 hour postdose, ±15 minutes for ECGs and vital
sign measurements at 2 hours postdose and ±5 minutes for PK sampling at 2 hours postdose, ±5 mi nutes for 3 to 4  hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose,
and ±30 minutes for 12 to 24, 72, and 96 hours postdose.
9.Subjects will be monitored via cardiac telemetry during the treatment period from approximately 1 hour prior to dose administ ration and until approximately 12 hours
postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7 (up- titration days). Based on the emerging safety data from the study, the duration of the telemetry may be extended if necessary . The
start and stop date and time of the telemetry monitoring will be recorded in the eCRF.

Study Title  
A Phase I, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -blind, Double-dummy, Placebo - and 
Positive -Controlled Study to Investigate the Effects of CBP-307 on the QT C Interval in 
Healthy Subjects  
Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic CBP -307 plasma 
concentrations on the heart- rate corrected QT interval (QTc) in healthy subjects.  
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To demonstrate assay sensitivity of the study to detect a small QT effect using 
moxifloxacin as a positive control.  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses of CBP-307 in healthy subj ects. 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of CBP -307 following administration of 
therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses in healthy subjects. 
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses of 
CBP -307 on heart rate (HR), PR and QRS intervals, and T-wave morphology. 
Study Design  
This will be a Phase I, randomized, double- blind, double -dummy, placebo-controlled, 
positive-controlled, multi- site, 3 -arm study to investigate the effects of therapeutic and 
supratherapeu tic oral doses of CBP-307 on the QTc interval in healthy male and female 
subjects.  
Potential subjects will be asked to read and sign an informed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eli gibility to 
enter the study will be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After informed consent has 
been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported. After placebo administra tion to all subjects on 
Day -1, all adverse events (AEs), whether volunteered, elicited, or noted upon physical examination, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from Day -1 until the end of the study).  
In this study, approximately 68 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be 
randomized into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 34 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub-groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 17 subjects. Randomized subjects will receive the assign ed study drug as a single dose in the morning on 
Protocol Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 8 of 67 Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and on Day 16 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on 
Day -1).  
The following treatments will be administered: 
• Starting doses of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  followed by an up- titrated 
dose of 0.1 mg on Day 2) 
• A therapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.2 mg, Days 3 to 6) 
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.5 mg, Days 7 to 15) 
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and CBP-307) 
• Moxifloxacin (400 mg)  
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study 
with an expected peak QT effect (placebo -corrected change- from -baseline QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec. 
Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day  -2 
(or on Day -4 depending on the clinical site’s requirement for Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID -19] testing) and will remain at the study site u ntil discharge on Day 19. Treatment 
administration will occur on Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and 16 under fasting conditions (all subjects will receive placebo on Day - 1). Continuous cardiodynamic electrocardiogram 
(ECG ) monitoring and recording will begin at least 25  hours prior to the administration of 
study treatments  on Day 1 and continue through 24  hours after the administration of study 
treatments on Day s 1, 6, 15, and 16 and at corresponding timepoints on the day before 
dosing, ie, Day -1. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint. Additional PK samples will be collected  at 72 and 
96 hours following dosing on Day 15. Subjects will return to the study site for a follow-up visit on Day 29±2  days.  
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on Day 1). Continuous cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Days -1, 1, 6, 15, and 16. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day -1. Replicate 12 -lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to 
dosing (-30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected at the following timepoints: prior to dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day (Days 1, 6, 
15, and 16; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5 hours postdose, ±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes for 12 to 24 hours postdose). Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15 (sample collection window: ±30 minutes ). Subjects will be 
inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which will end immediately prior to the PK

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 9 of 67 sampling. At each ti mepoint, up to 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time 
window (the last 5 minutes of the 15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a 
supine, quiet position). The ECG effects of CBP-307 will be tested on data from Day -1 (baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo), and Day 15 (supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be evaluated using ECG data collected on Days -1, 1, 15, and 16. 
The central ECG labo ratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to 
treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in the analyses will 
be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, safety 12 -lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at scre ening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow-up visit. In addition, subjects will be monitored via 
cardiac telemetry at specific timepoints during the treatment period.  
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening through follow-up visit) is anticipated to be approximately 59 days.  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first subject signs an ICF. The point of enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled). 
Number of Subjects  
Approximately 68 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 
2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 34 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2  sub-groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 17 subjects.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion 
Healthy male and female  subjects aged between 18 and 60 years (inclusive) with a body mass 
index between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m
2 (inclusive). 
Investigational Medicinal P roducts, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
The following treatments will be administered: 
• Starting doses of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  titrated to 0.1 mg on

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 10 of 67 • Moxifloxacin (400 mg ; oral tablet). 
Duration of Subject Particip ation in the Study  
Duration of subject participation from the screening visit through follow -up visit will be up to 
approximately 26 days for screening period  (Days -28 to -3 [or Day -5 depending on the 
clinical site’s requirement for C OVID -19 testing] ), 21+2 days for the in -house treatment  
period (Days -2 [or Day -4] to 19), and 10 ±2 days for follow-up (Day 29± 2 days) , in total 
approximately 59 days.  
Endpoints  
Electrocardiogram (Cardiodynamic):  
The primary cardiodynamic endpoint is the change- from -baselin e QTcF (ΔQTcF).  
The secondary cardiodynamic  endpoints are: 
• Change- from -baseline HR, PR, QRS ( ∆HR, ∆ PR, and ∆ QRS);  
• Placebo -corrected change- from -baseline HR, QTcF, PR, and QRS ( ∆∆HR, ∆∆ QTcF, 
∆∆PR, and ∆∆ QRS);  
• Categorical outliers for QTcF, HR, PR, and QRS;  
• Frequency of treatment -emergent changes of T - wave morphology and U- wave 
presence.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of plasma concentrations of CBP -307. The 
PK parameters of CBP -307 will be calculated using a model independent approach. The 
following PK parameter endpoints will be calculated: maximum observed concentration 
(Cmax), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero  extrapolated  to infinity 
(AUC inf), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to 24 hours postdose 
(AUC 0-24), and time of the maximum observed  concentration (t max). Other noncompartmental 
parameters may be reported.  
Safety: 
Adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), 
12-lead ECGs , and vital signs measurements.  
Statistical Methods  
Cardiodynamic evaluation: 
The primary analysis will be based on concentration -QTc modeling of the relationship 
between plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and change- from -baseline QTcF (∆QTcF) with

Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 11 of 67 the intent to exclude an effect of placebo -corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) >  10 msec at clinically 
relevant plasma levels. Placebo -corrected ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS , and ∆ QTcF (ΔΔHR, ΔΔPR, 
ΔΔQRS , and ∆∆ QTcF) will also be evaluated at each postdosing timepoint ('by- timepoint' 
analysis). An analysis of categorical outliers will be performed for changes in HR, PR, QRS, 
QTcF, T -wave morphology, and U -wave presence. Assay sensitivity will be evaluated by 
concentration -QTc analysis of t he effect on ∆ΔQTcF of moxifloxacin using a similar model 
as for the primary analysis.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
The analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mea n, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, maximum geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation) separately by cohort. Individual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time 
data will be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data may be provided as well.  
Pharmaco kinet ic/electrocardiography analyses: 
The relationship between CBP-307 plasma concentrations and the change from ∆ QTcF will 
be evaluated using a linear mixed -effects modeling approach.  
Safety: 
All AEs  will be listed and treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized using the descriptive 
methodology. Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activi ties. 
Observed values for clinical laboratory test data, 12 -lead ECGs , vital signs, and physical 
examination findings will be listed.

pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies , and adverse event (AE) profile 
of the investigational medicinal product (IM P). 
1.1. Disease  Background 
Autoimmune diseases are serious disorders that afflict a large portion of the world 
population; m ost have no cures. Significant advances have been made i n the development of 
novel and disease- modifying therapies, but many of these new treatments have significant 
side effects. Treatments are needed that provide better risk -to-benefit profiles than the 
existing therapeutic choices.  
T cells are important immu ne cells that mediate the development of autoimmune disorders. 
Migration of T cells from lymphoid tissues to the sites of inflammation is central to the functions of T cells, and this process is dependent on sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1P1) which  is known to ameliorate a variety of autoimmune diseases in animals and 
humans. Down modulation of this receptor, using S1P1 agonists, prevents T cell egress and results in a reduced number of circulating lymphocytes, particularly the CD4+- and CD8+-naïve and central -memory T cell subsets.  
1.2. Overview of CBP -307 
CBP -307 is an S1P1  agonist that is being developed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases 
by Suzhou Connect Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. CBP -307 (1 -(2-fluoro -4-(5-(4-isobutylphenyl)-
1,2,4-oxadiazol-3- yl) benzyl)  azetidine -3-carboxylic acid hemihydrate) is a potent, selective, 
small-molecule agonist of S1P1 and S1P5 receptor s. Cell -based assays have confirmed 
CBP -307 induces internalization of S1P1 from the cell surface. This is consistent with the 
known mechanism of action of other S1P1 agonists, in that they down-modulate S1P1 and inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues.  
1.2.1. Summary of Clinical Experience  
The Phase 1 development of CBP-307 comprised 2 completed studies in healthy subjects: 
• A single and multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
CBP -307 including pharmacokinetic ( PK), pharmacodynamic ( PD), and food- effect 
assessments (Study CBP -307AU001) 
• A single -dose and multiple-dose, and fixed-dose titration study t o evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of CBP -307 including PK and PD  (Study CBP -307CN001) 
Currently, CBP-307 is being evaluated in 2 Phase 2 studies:  
• Ongoing multicenter study in subjec ts with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis 
(Study  CBP -307CN002) to compare the clinical efficacy by evaluating the clinical 
response to CBP-307 versus placebo and the clinical remission and mucosal healing

tolerability of CBP -307 with those of plac ebo. 
• Ongoing study in subjec ts with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease compares clinical 
efficacy by evaluating the clinical response to CBP -307 versus placebo and the 
clinical remission and mucosal healing achieved by CBP -307 versus placebo and to 
compare the clinical safety and tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo. 
1.2.1.1.  Safety  
Study CBP-307AU001 
A total of 44 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. There were 28 subjects evaluated 
using the single -dose regimen (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 2.5 mg CBP -307) of which  21 subjects 
received CBP -307 and 7 subjects received placebo. Another 16 healthy subjects were 
evaluated using the multiple -dose regimen (0.15 and 0.25 mg CBP -307 given once daily 
[QD] for 28  consecutive days ) of which 12 subjects received  CBP -307 and 4 subjects 
received placebo.  
Overall,  no unexpected safety signals were identified  and no deaths occurred in this study. 
For the single -dose regiment, no subject s were discontinued due to a treatment -emergent AE 
(TEAE). In the multiple -dose regimen, there were 2 subjects who were discontinued from the 
study (due to increased alanine transaminase and second degree AV block [not considered to be clinically significant, as judged by the investigator]) . All TEAEs resolved by the end of 
the study. 
In the s ingle -dose regimen groups, TEAEs  were reported in 12 of 21 subjects (57.1%) treated 
with CBP -307 and in 3 of 7 subjects (42.8%) treated with placebo. Most (91.7%) of the 
TEAEs in these subjects were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in the 
CBP -307- treated groups were headache (28.6%); dizziness (19.0%); and bradycardia (9.5%). 
Bradycardia was reported only in 2 subjects receiving the highest (2.5 mg) CBP -307 dose. 
One subject had a serious adverse event (SAE) of bradycardia (associated with transient asystole) following a single  dose of 2.5 mg CBP -307. 
In the multiple -dose regimen groups, CBP-307 at doses of 0.15 and 0.25 mg QD was 
generally well tolerated over the 28 days of dosing. Treatment-e mergent AEs were reported 
in 11 of 12 subjects (91.7%) in the CBP -307 groups and 2 of 4 subjects (50.0%) in the 
placebo groups. Most (83.3% ) TEAEs were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in 
the 2 CBP-307 groups were headache (50.0%), and fatigue, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain (16.7% each). The incidences of these TEAEs were similar in both CBP -307- treated groups. 
No SAEs were reported for subjects in the multiple-dose regimen. 
Study CBP-307CN001 A total of 30 eligible subjects completed 3 CBP -307 dose groups in ascending order of dose 
after randomization (in a ratio of 1:1:1): Group A (0.1 mg), Group B (0.2 mg), and Group C 
(0.3 mg). Each dose group consisted of 10 subjects, including 8 subjects receiving the investigational drug and 2 subjects receiving placebo by random assignment. The administration star ted from the dose of 0.1 mg. The subjects in this group received a single

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 20 of 67 dose of CBP-307 or placebo and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 
7 days. Then the subjects received 0.1 mg CBP-307 or placebo QD for 14 consecutive days 
and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days. Dose escalation did not occur until the review of the single- dose regimen safety data from the 6  subjects in the 
previous dose cohort, and the safety data did not meet the termination criteria.  The subjects in 
the dose of 0.3 mg received fi xed-dose titration regimen, ie,  0.05 mg CBP-307 or placebo QD 
for 3  consecutive days; 0.1 mg CBP-307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days; 0.2 mg 
CBP -307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days; finally,  0.3 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD  for 
14 consecutive days, and the subjects were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days. 
Overall, no unexpected safety signals were identified, and there were no deaths, SAEs, or 
AEs leading to the subject’s early withdrawal from the study after administration of CBP -307. In the safety set, a total of 29 subjects ( 8 in Group A, 100%; 8 in Group B, 100%; 
8 in Group C, 100% and 5 in placebo group, 83.3%) experienced TEAEs. 
During the single -dose period, a total of 14 subjects (5 of 8 in Group A, 62.5%; 6 of 8 in 
Group B, 75%, and 3 of 4 in placebo group, 75%) developed AEs. T he incidence of TEAEs 
in Group A was generally similar to the placebo group. Among TEAEs in Group B, the 
incidence of AEs related to abnormalities  in investigations was higher than that in placebo 
group, including lymphocyte count decreased (12.5%), white blood cell ( WBC ) count 
decreased (12.5%), neutrophil count decreased ( 12.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased 
(25%), and gamma- glutamyltransfer ase increased (12.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased (12.5%). Additionally, 1 subject experienced heart rate (HR) decreased (12.5%). 
During dose-titration period, 2 subjects (2 of 8 in Group C, 25%) experienced TEAEs. The 
TEAEs reported in Group C during the titration period included cough (12.5%) and increased upper airway secretion (12.5%). There were no TEAEs in the placebo group during this period. 
During repeated -dose period, a total of 28 subjects (8 of 8 in Group A, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group 
B, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group C, 100%; and 4 of 6 in placebo group, 66.7%) experienced AEs. 
The most frequent TEAE in Group A was uppe r respiratory tract infection ( 37.5%) compared 
with placebo group; the most frequent TEAEs in Group B and Group C included decre ased 
lymphocyte count (Group B, 87.5%; Group C, 100.0%), WBC  count (Group B, 87.5%; 
Group C, 62.5%), and neutrophil count (Group B, 50%; Group C, 12.5%). The TEAEs noted in Group B during the repeated-dose period also included increased alanine aminotransf erase 
(25%), gamma -glutamyltransferase (37.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase (12.5%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (12.5%), influenza (12.5%), chest pain (12.5%), lethargy (25%), and neck pain (12.5%); TEAEs in Group C during the repeated- dose perio d also included 
increased alanine aminotransferase (25%), decreased HR  (12.5%), and mouth ulcer (12.5%); 
the TEAEs in placebo group included increased transaminase (16.7%), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (1/6, 16.7%), decreased hemoglobin (16.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (16.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), dizziness (16.7%), and palpitations (16.7%).

1.2.1.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
CBP -307 given orally as a single dose was readily absorbed; drug concentrations peaked at 
approximately 6  hours after administration, with an elimination apparent terminal elimination 
half-life (t1/2) of approximately 25 hours (range of 23 to 29 hours). The time to maximum 
observed concentration (C max) in the blood was delayed from 6 hours to approximately 
10 hours when CBP-307 was given with a high-fat diet. Food consumption also increased 
exposure ( Table 1). 
For the single -dose ad ministration, CBP -307 exposure (based on C max and area under the 
concentration -time curve  [AUC s]) increased with increasing dose following a single-dose 
administration  (Table 1).

1.3. O
verview of Moxifloxacin 
Moxifloxacin is a br oad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that binds to and inhibits the 
hERG IKr α subunit and causes a mean increase of the QTc interval of 6 ms after a single 400-mg oral dose. Moxifloxacin is commonly used as a positive control in thorough QT(TQT) studi es to satisfy the requirements of International Council for/Conference on
Harmonisation  (ICH) E14.
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert of AVELOX (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) tablets for additional information.

1.4. Study Rationale 
Regulatory guidance (ICH E14) has emphasized the need to obtain clear robust data on the effect of new chemical entities on electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters with focus on cardiac 
repolarization as measured by  the QTc duration. Though many Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials may be 
conducted they usually have an insufficient sample size, infrequent sampling of ECG data, or the use of inadequate controls to overcome the high rate of spontaneous change in QTc duration. This has resulted in regulatory guidance recommending a dedicated or thorough trial to define the ECG effects of new drugs. 
This study will be done in healthy subjects to eliminate variables  (concomitant drugs, 
diseases, etc.)  known to have an effect on ECG parameters. A supra therapeutic dose of 
CBP -307 is required to mimic the exposure in healthy subjects that may occur in the target 
population under the worst of circumstances (eg, concomitant use of cytochrome P450

the clinical dose prescribed) and to allow for PK to QTc modeling to assess the effect of drug 
concentration on cardiac repolarization. 
1.5. Benefit -risk Assessment  
Healthy subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an 
assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study . The risks of participation 
are primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there may also be some discomfort from the co llection of blood samples and other study 
procedures. More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs associated with CBP -307 may be found in the I B.

study (ie , from Day -1 until the end of the study ).  
In this study, approxim ately 68 healthy subjects ( at least  30% for each sex ) will be 
randomized into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 34 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub-groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 17 subjects . 
Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the mornin g on 
Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and on Day 16 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on Day -1).  
The follow ing treatments will be administered: 
• Starting doses of CBP -307 for titrat ion (0.05 mg  on Day 1  followed by an up- titrated 
dose of 0.1 mg on Day 2) 
• A therapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.2 mg, Days 3 to 6) 
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.5 mg , Day s 7 to 15) 
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and  CBP -307) 
• Moxifloxacin ( 400 mg)  
Mox ifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study 
with an expected peak QT effect (placebo -corrected change- from -baseline QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec.  An overview of the study design is shown in Figure  1.

samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15. An end-of-study visit will occur on 
Day 29±2 days . 
Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day  -2 
(or on Day -4 depending on the clinical site’s requirement for Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID -19] testing) and  will remain at  the study site until discharge on Day 19. Treatment 
administration will occur on Days  1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and 16 under fasting conditions (all 
subjects will receive placebo on Day - 1). Continuous cardiodynamic ECG monitoring and 
recording will begin at least 25 hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day 1 
and continue through 24 hours after the administration of study treatments  on Days 1, 6, 15, 
and 16 and at corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day -1. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint.  Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on 
Day 15. Subjects will return to the study site for a follow -up visit on Day 29±2  days.  
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on Day 1). Continuous cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Days -1, 1, 6, 15, and 16. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day -1. Replicate 12 -lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to 
dosing (-30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected at the following timepoints: prior to dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day ( Days  1, 6, 
15, and 16; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5 hours postdose, ±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes for 12 to 24 hours postdose). Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and  96 hours 
following dosing on Day 15 (sample collection window: ±30 minutes ). Subjects will be 
inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which will end immediately pr ior to the PK 
sampling. At each timepoint, up to 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time 
window (the last 5 minutes of the 15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine, quiet position). The ECG effects of CBP -307 will be tes ted on data from Day -1 
(baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo), and Day 15 (supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be evaluated using ECG data collected on Days -1, 1, 15, and 16. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to  be used in the analyses will 
be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, safety 1 2-lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at s creening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow-up visit. In addition, subjects will be monitored via 
cardiac telemetry at specific timepoints during the treatment period.

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 27 of 67 The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening  through follow-up 
visit) is anticipated to be approximately 59 days . 
The start of the study is defined as the date the first  subject  signs an ICF. The point of 
enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation. The end of the study is defined as 
the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled). 
A Schedule of Assessments is presented in  Appendix 6. 
3.2. Discussion of  Study Design  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for CBP-307 to cause QT prolongation. 
As CBP -307 exposure affects heart rate, the primary endpoint for this study will be the QTcF. 
The study will be randomized and double-blind because randomization eliminates 
confounding by baseline va riables and blinding eliminates confounding by co-interventions, 
thus eliminating the possibility that the observed effects of the intervention are because of differential use of othe r treatments.  
The samp le size for this study is based on a formal statistical power calculation . 
Conducting the study in healthy subjects mitigates the potential confounding effects of the disease state and concomitant medications.  Both male and female subjects will be included  to 
eliminate similar known ECG variability effects.  
Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP-307, subjects will be fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 4 hours postdose on the days when PK sam ples are collected . 
Pharmacokinetic assessments of CBP -307 concentrations in plasma will be evaluated during 
the study. The timepoints for the PK sample collections are based on previous studies and are considered adequate to allow for the characterization  of the drug’s PK after oral dosing. 
Furthermore, the chosen PK sample collection for CBP-307 is anticipated to be sufficient to allow reasonable estimation of t
1/2 during the terminal elimination phase.  
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
According to ICH E14, the highest therapeutic dose and a supratherapeutic dose are recommended for the QT/QTc study. The CBP -307 doses of 0.2 and 0.5 mg were chosen for 
evaluation in this study based on observed PK results in completed Phase 1 studies. To carefully monitor s afety following the administration of CBP -307 doses in Group 1, CBP -307 
doses will be up- titrated as follows: subjects will r eceive a s tarting dose of 0.05 mg CBP -307 
on Day 1 followed by an up- titrated dose of 0.1 mg on Day 2 and a dose of 0.2 mg on 
Days  3 to 6. Prior clinical experience with CBP -307 has not demonstr ated clinically 
significant abnormalities in laboratory test results in the majority of subjects or a dose -
response relationship for safety based on AEs. 
A single dose of 0.5 mg is the planned supratherapeutic dose, which balances the 
characteristics of the study design with the safety of healthy subject s. Testing of CBP-307 at

assigned a subject number prior to the first dosing occasion. Assignment of subject  numbers 
will be in ascending order and no numbers will be omitted (eg, Subjects  0101, 0102, 0103). 
The screening number will be used on all safety samples throughout the study. Replacement subjects ( Section  4.4) will be assigned a subject number corresponding to the number of the 
subject he/she is replacing plus 1000 (eg, Subject 1101 replaces Subject 0101). 
Subjects will be identified by screening  identification number or subject number only on all 
study documentation. A list identifying the subjects by subject number will be kept in the s ite 
master f ile. 
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
A subject is free to withdraw their informed consent from the study at any time  
or they may 
be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or the sponsor for safety, 
behavioral, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol-required visits or 
procedures . In addition, a subject will be withdrawn  from dosing if any of the following 
criteria are met:  
• change in compliance with any inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant 
and affects subject safety  as determined by the investigator  (or designee) 
• noncompliance with the study restrictions that might affect subject safety or study 
assessments/objectives, as considered applicable by the investigator (or designee) 
• any clinically relevant sign or symptom that, in the opinion of the investigator (or 
designee) , warrants subject withdrawal . 
If a subject is withdrawn from dosing, the sponsor will be notified and the date and reason(s) for the withdrawal will be documented in the subject’ s electronic ca se report f orm (e CRF). If 
a subject is withdrawn  from the study, efforts will be made to perform all follow -up 
assessments, if possible ( Appendix 6).  Other procedures may be performed at  the 
investigator ’s (or designee’s) and/or sponsor ’s discretion. If the subject is in -house, these 
procedures should be performed before the subject is discharged from the clinic. The investigator  (or designee) may also request that the su bject return for an additional follow-up 
visit. All withdrawn subjects will be followed until resolution of all their AEs or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator (or designee) to have stabilized.

Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 32 of 67 If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow-up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.  
Subjects who are withdrawn for reasons not related to study treatment  may be replaced 
following discussion between the investigator and the sponsor. Subjects withdrawn as a result 
of AEs thought to be related to the study treatment will generally not be replaced . 
4.5. Study Termination 
The study may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator  (or designee), sponsor , or 
sponsor ’s medical monitor if any of the following criteria are met:  
• investigator decides to terminate the study due to safety concerns such as AEs 
unknown to date (ie, not previously reported in any similar investigational study drug trial with respect to their nature, severity, and/or duration) 
• increased frequency , severity , and/or duration of known, anticipated, or previously 
reported AEs (this may also apply to AEs defined at check -in as baseline signs and 
symptoms)  
• medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study  
• difficulties  in the recruitment of subjects  
• cancelation of drug development 
• sponsor requests for termination (eg, due to financial or management reasons, etc.) under the premise to fully protect the safety and rights of subjects  
• health  authority or institutional review board (IRB)/ ethics committee (EC) orders the 
termination of the trial for any reason . 
Definition of end-of-t reatment and end-of-s tudy  
• end-of- treatment is completion of safety follow -up or withdrawal from the study. 
End-of-study is the last visit by the last subject.

All supplies of the IMP, both bulk and subject- specific, will be stored in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s or pharmacy’s instructions. Until dispensed to the subjects, the study 
treatments will be stored at the study site in a location that is locked with restricted access.  
5.2. Study Treatment Administration  
Each dose of study treatment  (CBP -307, placebo, or moxifloxacin) will be administered 
orally following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, with approximately 240 mL of room 
temperature water. Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP-307, subjects will be f asted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 
4 hours postdose on the days when PK samples are collected . 
Subjects will be dosed in numerical order while sitting or standing but not be permitted to lie supine for 2 hours after treatment administration , except as necessitated by the occurrence of 
an AE(s) and/or study procedures. 
5.3. Randomization 
This is a  double-blind randomized study. Subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment 
sequences before administration of the first dose of study treatment . A randomization list will 
be generated by a statistician using a computer -generated pseudo-random permutation 
procedure. The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and 
on the enrollment eCRF. A computer -generated randomization schedule and emergency 
code-break envelopes will be provided to the study site. Randomization details will be included in the randomization specification.

Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 35 of 67 5.4. Blinding  
This is a double-blinded study. The following controls will be employed to maintain the 
double-blind status of the study: 
• The placebo will be identical in appearance to CBP -307 or moxifl oxacin.  
• The investigator and other members of staff involved with the study will remain blinded to the treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure.  
• Interim bioanalytical data will be provided to Labcorp  Early Clinical Biometrics  in a 
blinded manner. 
To maintain the blind, the investigator will be provided with a sealed randomization code for each subject, containing coded details of the treatment. These individual ly sealed envelopes 
will be kept in a limited access area that is accessible 24 hours a day. If, in order to manage subject safety or to support dose escalation dec isions (in the event of possibly 
treatment -related  SAEs or severe AEs), the decision to unblind resides solely with the 
investigator. Whenever possible, and providing it does not interfere with or delay any decision in the best interest of the subject, the investigator will discuss the intended code- break  with the sponsor. If it becomes necessary to break the code during the study, the 
date, time, and reason will be recorded in the subject's source data and on the individual envelope and will be witnessed by a second person. 
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The follow ing measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance:  
• All doses will be administered under the supervision of suitably qualified study site 
staff. 
• Immediately after dose administration, visual inspection of the mouth and hands will be performed for each subject . 
• At each dosing occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of IMP will be performed.   
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The investigator (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of study treatments (CBP -307, moxifloxacin, placebo- matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched 
moxifloxacin)  received. In addition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, 
specifying the amount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensing. This drug 
accountability record will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the 
study, the original drug accountability record will be available for review by the sponsor upon request. 
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarded upon 
satisfactory comple tion of the compliance and accountability procedures. Any unused 
assembled unit doses will be retained until the completion of the study.

Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 36 of 67 At the completion of the study, all unused study treatments  (CBP -307, moxifloxacin, 
placebo -matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched moxifloxacin) will be disposed of by the 
study site ’s pharmacy, per the sponsor ’s written instructions.  If destruction is authorized to 
take place at the study site ’s pharmacy, the investigator must ensure that the materials are 
destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations and institutional policy. 
All study drug destructions must be adequately documented. 
6. CONCOMITANT THERAPIES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS  
6.1. Concomitant Therapies  
Subjects will refrain from the use of any prescription  or nonprescription medication s/products 
during the study until the follow-up visit, unless the investigator  (or designee)  and/or sponsor 
have given their prior consent. Medications taken within 28 days before study treatment 
administration will be documen ted as a prior treatment. Treatments taken after study 
treatment administration will be documented as concomitant treatments.  
Paracetamol/acetaminophen  (2 g/day for up to 3 consecutive days ) is an  acceptable 
concomitant medication . The administration of an y other concomitant medications during the 
study is prohibited without prior approval of the investigator  (or designee) , unless its use is 
deemed necessary for the treatment of an AE . Any medication taken by a subject during the 
course of the study and the reason for its use will be documented in the source data.  
Females will refrain from the use of hormone replacement therapy  and oral, implantable, 
transdermal, injectable, or intrauterine hormonal contraceptives (with the exception of 
Mirena®) during the study until the follow-up visit ( Appendix 4). 
6.2. Diet 
While confined at the study site, subjects will receive a standardized diet at scheduled times 
that do not conflict with other study- related activities. Subj ects will be  fasted overnight ( at 
least 10 hours ) before the collection of blood samples for c linical laboratory evaluations . 
On the days with PK assessments ( Appendix 6), the subjects will be fasted  over night ( at least  
10 hours) prior to dosing and refrain from consuming water from 1 hour predose until  1 hour 
postdose, excluding the amount of water consumed at dosing. Food is allowed from 4 hours 
postdose. At all other times during the study, subjects may consume water ad libitum. 
Foods and beverages containing poppy seeds , grapefruit , or Seville oranges will not be 
allowed from 7 days prior to check -in until follow-up visit on Day 29±2 days . 
Consumption of c affeine/xanthine-containing foods and beverages will not be allowed from 
48 hours before check -in until discharge on Day 19. 
Consumption of alcohol will not be permitted from 72 hours prior to check -in until discharge 
on Day 19 and alcohol intake will be limited to a maximum of 2 units/day on all other days, 
whilst not at the study site, from screening  to 72 hours prior to the follow-up visit on 
Day 29±2 days.

Subjects will not be permitted to  use tobacco - or nicotine-containing products within 
3 months prior to check -in until the follow-up visi t. 
6.4. Exercise  
Subjects are required to refrain fr om strenuous exercise from 7 days  before check -in until the 
follow-up visit ( Day 29±2 days) and will otherwise maintain their normal level of physical 
activity during this time (ie, will not begin a new exercise program nor participate in any 
unusually strenuous physical exertion). 
6.5. Blood Donation 
Subjects are required to refrain from donation of blood from 3 months prior to screening, 
plasma from 2 weeks prior to screening, and platelets from 6 weeks prior to s creening until 
3 months after the follow-up visit. 
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures as closely as possible to the 
nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practi cal restrictions, 
and the other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. 
The highest priority procedures will be performed closest to the nominal time. The order of 
priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority):  
• dosing 
• continuous ECG extraction window 
• pharmacokinetic blood samples  
• safety assessments  
• any other procedures . 
This study includes a screening period (Day -28 to Day -3 [or Day -5 depending on the clinical site’s requirement for C OVID -19 testing ]), a treatment period (Days -2 [or Day -4] to 
19), and a follow-up period (Day 29 ±2 days ).  
The defined abnormal vital sign measurements (Exclusion Criteria #4) at check -in (Day -2 or 
Day -4 depending on the clinical site’s requirement for COVID -19 testi ng) or baseline 
(Day -1 predose) will only be considered exclusionary if judged applicable by the investigator. For confirmation of enrollment eligibility based on pulse rate, the pulse rate 
assessed by vital signs, rather than the 12-lead ECG, will be used. For all subjects, the screening, check -in, or baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate may be 
repeated after 5 to 10 minutes if the initial reading is believed to be atypical for the subject.

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 38 of 67 7.1. General Assessments  
7.1.1. Demographics 
Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order 
to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.  
7.1.2. Medical History  
At the timepoint specified in Appendix 6, the i nvestigator or designee will collect a complete 
medical and surgical history. Medical history will include information on the subject’s concurrent medical conditions and any events occurring prior to the first dose of study treatment. All findings will be recorded on the medical history eCRF.  
7.2. Electrocardiography Assessments  
7.2.1. Continuous 12 -lead Electrocardiogram Recording  
Continuous 12- lead digital ECG recording will be performed as specified in Appendix 6. All 
ECG data will be collected using a Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG continuous 12- lead 
digital recorder. The 12-lead Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG equipment will be supplied and supported by ERT (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA). The continuous 
12-lead digital ECG data will be stored onto SD memory cards.  
The ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected by pred etermined timepoints as defined 
in Appendix 6 and will be read centrally by ERT  (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, 
PA). The following principles will be followed in ERT’s core laboratory: 
• ECG analysts are blinded to the subject, visit, and treatment allocation.  
• Baseline and on -treatment ECGs f or a particular subject will be over -read on the same 
lead and will be analyzed by the same reader.  
The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analy zable, then the primary lead of 
analysis will be changed to another lead for the entire subject  data set.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be extracted in up to 10 replicates at the predefined timepoints and 
subjects will be inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each nominal time.  
7.2.1.1.  TQT Plus Extraction Technique  
Ten 14-second digital 12-lead ECG tracings will be extracted from the continuous Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) recordings using the ‘TQT Plus method’, a computer- assisted and 
statistical process utilized by ERT. The method enables extraction of ECGs with the lowest HR variability and  noise within the protocol- specified extraction time window ( eg, the HR 
and QT changes from beat -to-beat in the range of <10%). At each protocol- specified 
timepoint, 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute “ECG window” (typically,

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 39 of 67 the last 5 minutes of the 15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine, quiet 
position).  
7.2.1.2.  Expert  Precision QT Analysis  
Expert  precision QT analysis will be performed on all analyzable (non- artifact) beats in the 
10 ECG replicates . Statistical quality control procedures  are used to review and assess all 
beats and identify “high” and “low” confidence beats using several criteria, including: 
• QT or QTc values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely). 
• RR values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely). 
• Rapid changes in QT, QTc, or RR from beat- to-beat.  
Measurements of all primary ECG parameters (QT, QTc, RR) in all recorded beats of all replicates that are deemed “high confidence” will be performed using COMPAS software. All low -confidence beats will be reviewed manually and adjudicated using pass- fail criteria. 
The final QC assessment will be performed by a cardiologist. The beats  found acceptable by 
manual review will be included in the analysis. The median QT, QTc, and RR values from each extracted replicate will be calculated, and then the mean of all available medians from a nominal timepoint will be used as the subject’s reportable value at that timepoint.  
Categorical T -wave morphology analysis and the measurement of PR and QRS interval of the 
ECG (QRS) intervals will be performed manually in 3 of the 10 ECG replicates at each timepoint. Each fiducial point (onset of P-wave, onset of Q-wave, offset of S-wave, and offset of T -wave) will be ele ctronically marked. 
For T -wave morphology and U- wave presence, treatment -emergent changes will be assessed 
(ie, changes not present at baseline). For each category of T-wave morphology and U- waves, 
the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate at the timepoint. For baseline, the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate from all timepoints that constitute baseline.  
7.2.2. Safety 12- lead Electrocardiogram  
Resting 12- lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine and at rest for at 
least 5  minutes at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Single 
12-lead ECGs will be repeated twice, and an average taken of the 3 reading s, if either of the 
following criteria applies : 
• QT interval corrected for HR  using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) is >500 ms  
• QTcF change from the baseline (predose) is >60 ms. 
Additional 12- lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinically 
appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of ECGs 
is required. The investigator (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of each 12- lead 
ECG.

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 40 of 67 7.2.3. Cardiac Telemetry Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored via card iac telemetry  from approximately 1 hour prior to dose 
administration and until approximately 12 hours postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7 (up- titration 
days; as described in Appendix 6). Based on the emerging safety data from the study, the 
duration of the telemetry may be extended if necessary.  
The start and stop date and time of the telemetry monitoring will be recorded in the eCRFs. 
Clinically significant abnormalities noted from telemetry monitoring will be confirmed by 12-lead ECG  if ne cessary , then after confirming, the abnormities will be reported as AEs in 
the e CRF.  
7.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments   
7.3.1. Pharmacokinetic  Blood Sample Collection and Processing 
Blood samples ( approximately 1  × 4 mL  for CBP -307 and mox ifloxacin  assays ) will be 
collected by veni puncture or cannulation at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments in  Appendix 6. Procedures for collection, processing, and shipping of PK blood 
samples will be detailed in a separate document .  
7.3.2. Analytical Methodology 
Plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and moxifloxacin will be determined using  a validated 
analytical procedure. Specifics of the analytical method  will be provided in a separate 
document.  
7.4. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
7.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions, assignment of severity and causality, and procedures for reporting 
SAEs are detailed in  Appendix 1. 
The condition of each subject w ill be monitored from the time of signing the ICF until the 
follow-up visit. Subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their condition by open questioning, such as “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”, at least o nce each day while resident at the study site and each study visit. Subjects 
will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during the study.  
All nonserious AEs, whether reported by the subject voluntarily or upon questioni ng, or 
noted on physical examination, will be recorded from initiation of placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) until study completion. If AEs that occur in the screening prior to 
placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) are considered to be related to the study 
procedure, they should be also collected. Serious AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the ICF until study completion.  The nature, time of onset, duration, and severity 
will be documented, together with an investigator ’s (or designee’s) opinion of the 
relationship to study treatment.

to resolution or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator (or designee) to have 
stabilized. This will be completed at the investigator ’s (or designee’s) discretion. 
7.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations  at the times 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Clinical laboratory evaluations are listed in Appendix 2. 
A serum qualitative pregnancy or urine test (females only) and follicle -stimulating hormon e 
test (postmenopausal females only) will be performed at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix 6. A positive urine pregnancy test will be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. All pregnancies should be r eported as specified in Appendix 1. 
Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of clinical laboratory safety evaluations is required. At the discretion of the investigator, clinically significant clinical laboratory assessments may be confirmed by repeat sampling. If the clinical significance is confirmed, subject s will be excluded from 
participation or, if already included, will be followed until normalization of the test result or for as long as the investigator considers necessary.  
Subjects will be asked to provide urine samples for drugs of abuse screen and cot inine test, 
and will undergo an alcohol breath test  at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
in Appendix 6. For all female subjects, a pregnancy test will be performed at the times indicated in  the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6.   
An investigator  (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical laboratory data.  
7.4.3. Vital Signs  
Supine blood pressure, supine pulse rate, respirat ory rate, and tympanic temperature will be 
assessed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Vital signs 
may also be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of vital signs is required.  
All measurements will be performed singly . For all subjects, the screening, check -in, or 
baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate may be repeated after 5 to 10 minutes if the initial reading is believed to be atypical for the subject.  
Subjects must be supine for at least 5  minutes before blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements.

gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, skin, and  others. 
Height, weight, and body mass index  will be assessed at screening.  
8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 68 healthy subjects (at least  30% for each sex ) will be randomized into 
2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 34 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups 
(Group  2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 17 subjects.  
Sample S ize for Primary Analysis: 
A samp le size of 28 evaluable subjects per treatment group will provide more than 94.4% 
power to exclude that CBP-307 causes more than 10- msec QTc effect at clinically relevant 
plasma levels, as shown by the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI ) of 
the model- predicted QT effect (Δ ΔQTcF) at the observed geometric mean C max of CBP -307 
in the study. This power is estimated approximately using a 2 -sample t -test. The calculation 
assumes a  1-sided 5% significance level, an underlying effect of CBP-307 of 3 msec and a 
standard deviation (SD) of the ΔQTcF of 8 msec for both CBP-307 and placebo treatment groups. Note that this calculation is conservative, since it does not take into account any gain in precision due to the use of all data of each subject with the help of a linear mixed -effects  
model. The concentration-QTc analysis method is supported by  Darpo et al 2015
3 and 
Ferber  et al, 2015,4 and consistent with the experiences from 25 recent TQT studies. 
Sample Size Considerations for Assay Sensitivity:  
To demonstrate assay sensitivity with concentration- QTc analysis, it has to be shown that the 
ΔΔQTcF of a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin exceeds 5 msec (ie, the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc effect [ΔΔQTcF] should exceed 5 msec). In a similarly 
designed, recent crossover study with 24 healthy subjects  (on-file data, ERT) , the standard 
error (SE) for the prediction of the QT effect of moxifloxacin based on the exposure-response analysis was 1.24 msec. The within -subject SD of ΔQTcF in the referred study was 5.4 msec  
based on the by-t imepoint analysis. If the effect of moxifloxacin is assumed to be 10  msec, 
the SE of 1.24 msec corresponds to an effect size of (10-5)/(1.24×sqrt[24])=0.82, where the effect size is the effect assumed under the alternative hypothesis divided by the SD of t he test 
variable. This value should be compared to the effect size of 0.64 required to guarantee a power of at least 95% in a paired  t-test situation with a sample size of 28  evaluable subjects. 
In other words, based on this calculation, a power of at leas t 95% will be obtained as long as 
the variability of the ΔQTcF, as measured by its within -subject SD  from the by -timepoint 
analysis, does not exceed 6.9 msec (ie, 1 28% [= 0.82/0.64] of the 5.4 msec observed in the 
referred study  assuming the ratio of effec tive sizes is consistent with inverse ratio of 
within -subject SD ). The number also agrees with recent recommendations of the FDA, which 
propose at least 20 subjects.

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 43 of 67 8.2. Analysis Populations 
8.2.1. Cardiodynamic Population  
The QT/QTc population will include all subjects in the safety population with measurements 
at baseline as well as on -treatment with at least 1 postdose timepoint with a valid ΔQTcF 
value.  The QT/QTc population will be used for the by- timepoint and categorical analyses of 
the cardiodynamic ECG parameters.  
The PK/QTc population will include all subjects who are in both the QT/QTc and PK populations wit h at least 1 pair of postdose PK and ∆ QTcF data from the same timepoint as 
well as subjects in the QT/QTc population who received placebo. The PK/QTc population will be used for the concentration- QTc analysis and assay sensitivity. PK/QTc population 
will b e defined for CBP -307, and for moxifloxacin.  
The as -treated principle will be applied to all analysis populations mentioned below. 
8.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product  and have evaluable PK data of any of the analytes (CBP -307 and moxifloxacin) . A 
subject will be excluded from the PK summary statistics and statistical analysis if the subject 
has an AE of vomiting that occurs at or before 2 times median time to maximum concentration.  
8.2.3. Safety Population 
The safety population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product drug (therapeutic and supra therapeutic doses of CBP-307, moxifloxacin, or placebo). 
8.3. Cardiodynamic ECG Analyses 
Baseli ne for Cardiodynamic ECG Assessments  
Baseline for the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 ( CBP -307 in Group 1 versus 
placebo  in Groups 2A and 2B ) will be time -matched values on Day -1.  
For assay sensitivity  in Groups 2A and 2B, the following baselines will be used: 
• Group 2A: For moxifloxacin administered  on Day 1 (defined as Period 1 Day 1), 
baseline will be Day 16 (defined as Period 1 Day -1), on which subjects are administer ed placebo. For placebo-correction in this group, placebo values will be 
derived from Day 15 (defined as Period 2 Day 1) on which subjects are administered 
placebo, and baseline will be obtained on Day -1 (defined as Period 2 Day -1). 
• Group 2B: For moxifloxacin administere d on Day 16 (defined as Period 2 Day 1), 
baseline will be Da y 1 (defined as Period 2 Day - 1), on which subjects are 
administered  placebo. For the placebo-correction in this group, Day -1 (defined as

obtained on Day 15 (defined as Per iod 1 Day -1). 
Concentration- QTc Analysis (Primary Analysis) 
The relationship between CBP-307 plasma concentrations and change- from -baseline QTcF 
(∆QTcF) will be quantified using a linear mixed- effects modeling approach with ΔQTcF as 
the dependent variable, time-matched concentrations of CBP-307 as the exploratory variate 
(0 for placebo), treatment (act ive=1 or placebo=0), and time (ie , postbaseline timepoints on 
Days 1, 6, and 15 categorical) as fixed effects , and a random intercept and slope per subject.6 
Centered baselin e QTcF (i.e., baseline QTcF for individual subject minus the population 
mean baseline QTcF for all subjects) will be included in this model as an additional covariate. If necessary, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using the model without this term. 
The degrees of freedom estimates will be determined by the Kenward -Roger method. From 
the model, the slope (ie , the regression parameter for the CBP -307 concentration) and the 
treatment effect -specific intercept will be estimated together with 2 -sided 90% CI . The 
estimates for the time effect will be reported with degrees of freedom and SE.  For the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 versus placebo, the time term incorporated 
into the models (both by-timepoint analysis and concentration -QTc analysis [or assay 
sensit ivity]) includes the single predose timepoint and all post dose time points on Days 1, 6, 
and 15, and Days 1 and 16 for active versus placebo and moxifloxacin versus placebo, 
respectively. All times are relative to the time of dosing on that day which is considered the first dose for the assay sensitivity analysis. For the analysis of CBP-307 versus placebo, the first dose of study treatment is on Day 1. 
The geometric mean of the individual C
max values for CBP-307 concentrations for subjects in 
the active drug groups on each of Days 6 and 15 will be determined, respectively. The 
predicted effect and its 2 -sided 90% CI for placebo- corrected change -from -baseline QTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) (ie , slope estimate × concentration + treatment effect -specific intercept) at this 
geometric mean C max will be obtained.  
To evaluate the adequacy of model fit with respect to the assumption of linearity, the 
observed ΔQTcF values adjusted by population time effect estimated from the model will be used. These individual placebo- adjusted ΔQTcF
i,k (ΔΔQTcF i,k) values equal the observed 
individual ΔQTcF i,k for subject i administered with active drug or placebo at timepoint k 
minus the estimated population mean pl acebo effect at timepoint k (ie, time effect). A decile 
plot, i e, plo t of the deciles of observed concentrations and the mean placebo -adjusted ΔQTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) and 90% CI at the median concentration within each decile will be given. The regression line presenting the model- predicted ΔΔQTcF
7 will be added to evaluate the fit of a 
linear model and visualize the concentration-response relationship. The placebo -adjusted 
ΔQTcF i,j equals the individual ΔQTcF i,j for subject i administered with CBP -307 at timepoint 
j minus the estima tion of time at timepoint j (ie , time effect). Additional exploratory analyses 
(via graphical displays and/or model fitting) will include accounting for a delayed effect (hysteresis) and the justification for the choice of PD model (linear versus nonlinear) as 
follows.  
Protocol Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 45 of 67 Criteria for N egative QT Assessment  
If the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc effect of ΔΔQTcF at the 
observed geometric mean C max on Days 6 and 15 as well as clinically relevant plasma levels 
is below 10 msec (ie,  the upper bound of the 2- sided 90% CI at the geometric mean C max 
<10 msec), it can be concluded that CBP-307 does not cause cl inically concerning QT 
prolongation within the observed plasma concentration ranges .  
Investigation of H ysteresis  
Hysteresis will be assessed based on joint graphical displays of the least squares (LS) mean 
ΔΔQTcF for each postbaseline timepoint and the me an concentration of CBP- 307 at the same 
timepoints. In addition, hysteresis plots will be given for LS mean ΔΔQTcF and the mean 
concentrat ions. If a QT effect (ΔΔQTcF) > 10 msec cannot be excluded from the by -timepoint 
analysis in the active dose groups on Days 6 and 15 ; and the mean peak ΔΔQTcF effe ct is 
observed at the same timepoint in the by- timepoint analysis in the active dose groups on 
Days  6 and 15; and if the difference ( delay ) between the time to reach the  peak QT c effect 
(ΔΔQTcF) and peak plasma concentration (t max) in the plot (ΔΔQTcF versus CBP -307) of 
more than 1 hour is observed in a consisten t way for the active dose groups on Days 6 and 15, 
other concentration- QTc models, such as a model with an effect compartment, may be 
explored. With the provision stated above, hysteresis will be assumed if this curve shows a counterclockwise loop. A significant treatment effect- specific intercept may also be 
indicative of hysteresis  or model misspecification , if it cannot be explained by a nonlinear 
relati onship. 
Appropriateness of a L inear Model 
To assess the appropriateness of a linear model, normal quantile-quantile plots for the standardized residuals and the random effects, scatter  plots of standardized residuals versus 
concentration and versus fitted values , and box plots of standardized residuals versus nominal 
time and versus active treatment will be produced. The scatter plot of standardized residuals versus concentration by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing  (LOESS ) fitting (ie , locally 
weight ed scatterplot smoothing
8 lines ) also will be produced with an optimal smoothing 
parameter selected by the Akaike information criterion with a correction.9 In addition, a 
scatter plot of observed concentration and ΔQTcF with a LOESS smooth line with 90% CI and a linear regression line will also be provided to check the assumption of a linear concentration -QTc relationship. If there is an indication that a linear model is  inappropriate, 
additional models may be fitted, such as an E -max model. The concentration -QTc analysis 
will then be repeated for the model found to best accommodate the nonlinearity detected. 
Assay Sensitivity  
Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by similar concentration -QTc analysis of 
moxifloxacin data. If the slope of the concentration -QTc (change -from -baseline QTcF) for 
moxifloxacin is statistically significant at 10% level for 2 -sided test and the lower bound of 
the 2 -sided 90% CI of the predicted e ffect is above 5 msec at the observed geometric mean 
C
max of the 400-mg dose, assay sensitivity will be deemed to have been demonstrated.

Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January 2022  Page 46 of 67 By-Time point Analysis 
The analysis for QTcF for CBP -307 versus placebo will be based on a linear mixed -effects 
model w ith change- from -baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) as the dependent variable, time (ie, 
postbaseline timepoints on Days 1, 6, and 15: categorical), treatment (therapeutic dose of 
CBP -307 and supratherapeutic dose of CBP-307 on Day 15, and corresponding placebo), and 
time-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. Baseline QTcF will be included in this mod el 
as an additional covariate. If necessary, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using the 
model without this term. An unstructured covariance matrix will be speci fied fo r the repeated 
measures at post dose timepoints within subjects. If the model with unstructured covariance 
matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices such as compound symmetry and autoregressive will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean , SE,  and 2 -sided 90% CIs 
will be calculated for the contrast “CBP -307 versus placebo” for each day of Days 1, 6, and 
15 at each postbaseline timepoint on Days 1, 6, and Day 15, respectively . 
The by -timepoint analysis for QTc F will be also performed f or moxifloxacin versus placebo 
at post baseline timepoints on Day 1 and Day 16. A linear mixed -effects model will be used 
with ΔQTcF as the dependent variable and time (ie, postbaseline time points on Days 1 and 
16: categorical), treatment (moxifloxacin and placebo), period (as described in baseline definition for assay sensitivity), sequence (placebo/moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin/placebo), and time -by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. Baseline QTcF will be included in this 
model as an additional covariate.  If necessary, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using 
the model wi thout this term.  An unstructured covariance matrix will be specified for the 
repeated measures at postbaseline timepoints for subject within visit. The model will also include a subject -specific random effect. If the model with an unstructured covariance m atrix 
fails to converge, other covariance matrices, such as compound symmetry or autoregressive, will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean, SE,  and 2-sided 90% CIs will be 
calculated for the contrast “moxifloxacin versus placebo” at each postbase line timepoint on 
Day 1 , respectively . 
For HR, PR, and QRS intervals, the analysis will be based on the change- from -baseline 
postdose (ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS). The same (b y-timepoint analysis) model will be used as 
described for QTcF. The LS mean, SE, and 90% CI from the statistical modeling for both change- from -baseline and placebo -corrected change -from -baseline values will be listed in the 
tables and graphically displayed. 
Categorical Analyses 
The analysis results for categorical outliers, T -wave morphology, and U- wave presence will 
be summarized in frequency tables with counts (percentages) for both the number of subjects 
and the number of timepoints. For categorical outliers, the number (percentage) of subjects as well as time points who had increases in absolute QTcF values >450 and ≤480 msec, >480

from pre dose baseline > 25% to a QRS > 120 msec; decrease i n HR from pre dose baseline 
>25% to a n HR < 50 bpm; and increase in HR from pre dose baseline >25% to a n HR 
>100 bpm will be determined. For T-wave morphology and U- wave presence, the analyses 
will be focused on change fr om baseline (ie , treatment -emergent changes).

Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January  2022  Page 50 of 67 Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subjec t or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatme nt. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign 
(including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , whether or not related to the study 
treatment . This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that had increased 
in severity or frequency since the administration of study medication.  
Examples of AEs include: 
• Symptoms described by the subject, or signs observed by the investigator, and 
• Abnormal findings (involving clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, ECG, 
etc.)  
• Exacerbation of previous condition, including increased incidence and/or severity. 
Note: Regarding decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood in this study, plea se report 
them as follows: 
• Since a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood is due to the mechanism of 
action of the drug, it is not to be reported as an AE. However, clinical diagnosis 
related to a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood indi cates AE reporting (if 
no diagnosis is available, it is required to report related clinical symptoms or signs).  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs. All AEs will 
be recorded in the medical records and eCRFs. The investigator (or designee) is to record in 
detail any AE that occurred to the subject, including: AE diagnosis whenever possible, or signs, symptoms, the start da te and time of occurrence, the stop date and tim e of occurrence, 
seriousness (ie , whether it is a n SAE), severity of AEs, causality assessment, actions taken on 
the investigational product, other actions (eg, medications/treatments given), and outcomes of AEs.  
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE using the 
following categories:  
• Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
• Moderate:  Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent r isk of harm to the subject. 
Protocol Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January  2022  Page 51 of 67 • Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly  affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study treatment using a 4-category system according to the following guidelines: 
• Not Related : The AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study 
procedure/conditions. 
• Unlikely Related : The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that 
the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE. 
• Possibly Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedures/conditions. 
• Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of 
the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause- effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced.  
Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Every reasonable effort will be made to follow up with subjects who have AEs. Any subject who has an ongoing AE that is  possibly related or related to the IMP or study procedures at 
the follow-up visit will be followed up, where possible, until resolution or until the unresolved AE is judged by the investigator (or designee) to have stabilized . This will be 
completed at the investigator ’s (or designee’s) dis cretion.  Any subject who has an ongoing 
AE that is not related or unlikely related to the IMP or study procedures at the follow-up visit 
can be closed out as ongoing at the investigator ’s discretion.  
Adverse Drug Reactions  
All noxious and unintended responses to an  IMP ( ie, where a causal relationship between an 
IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions.  
For marketed medicinal  products, a response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and 
which  occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases 
or modification of physiological function is to be considered an adverse drug reaction. 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, IB for an unapproved IMP).  
Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be collected after subjects sign the informed consent form and throughout the entire study,  ie, until the end-of-study as specified in the protocol (or at  early termination).  
Protocol Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January  2022  Page 52 of 67 An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose either:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exi sting hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• results in an important medical event (see below) . 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Instances of death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the investigator  at 
any time after cessation of the study treatment and considered by the inves tigator  to be 
possibly related to the study treatment, will be reported to the sponsor (or designee) . 
Definition of Life-threatening 
An AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred (ie, does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a 
more serious form). For instance, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal.  
Definition of Hospitalization  
Adverse events requiring hospitalization should be considered serious. In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that  would not have 
been appropriate at the study site . When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or 
was necessary, the AE should be considered as serious. 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical pro cedures, which are not the result of 
an AE, need not be considered AEs and should be recorded on a clinical assessment form and 
added to the e CRF . If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, this must be 
reported as an AE and either ‘serious’ or ‘nonserious’ attributed according to the usual criteria.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator will complete an SAE report form and forward it by facsimile  or email  to 
Labcorp  Drug Safety  and the sponsor immediately (within 24  hours) upon becom ing aware of 
an SAE.

Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January  2022  Page 53 of 67 All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) to:

The responsibilities of Labcorp  Drug Safety  include the following: 
• Prepare an AE reporting plan prior to the start of the study. Where this plan differs 
from the applicabl e study site  standard operating procedure on SAE reporting, the 
safety management p lan will always take precedence.  
• Receive and review SAE report forms from the study site  and inform the sponsor of 
the SAE within 1 working day of the initial notification to Labcorp  Drug Safety   who 
will delete any information from the SAE report forms that may identify the subject.  
• Write case narratives and enter the case into Labcorp ’s safety database as defined in 
the AE reporting plan. 
• Produce appropriate reports of all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions and 
forward them to the IRB/ EC, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, 
FDA, principal investigator, and the sponsor within the timeframes stipulated in the 
Clinical Trials Directive Guideline (EN TR/CT  3).  
The responsibility for reporting SAEs will be transferred to the sponsor 28 days after the end 
of the study. 
For SAEs, the active reporting period to sponsor or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent through to the last subject  visit.  
Nonserious AEs should be collected from the time the subject  has taken the placebo dose on 
Day -1 through the last subject  visit. If AEs that occur in the screening prior to the placebo 
administration to all su bjects on Day -1 are considered to be related to the study procedure, 
they should be also collected.  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, the 
sponsor should be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event. This time 
frame also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE 
reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his or her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the sponsor in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting as specified above. In addition, an investigator 
Protocol Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January  2022  Page 54 of 67 may be requested by the sponsor to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an 
expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the AE eCRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Inf ormation on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the sponsor or its designated representative.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy (maternal or paternal exposure to study treatment ) does not meet the definition of 
an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. 
If the female subject becomes pregnant during the clinical trial and has not yet been dosed 
with study treatment, she must be withdrawn from the study. If the female subject becomes pregnant during the clinical trial and has been dosed, she must discontinue treatment immediately  but may remain on study for safety evaluations . If the partner of a male subject 
becomes pregnant during the clinical trial, the subject can continue the clinical trial.  
For pregnancy of female subjects or partners of the male subjects during this study, investigators should report to the sponsor or designee in a pregnancy report form within 24 hours after investigator awareness and report to the IRB/ EC in time as per local 
requirement.  
The investigator will follow up on pregnancy outcomes, until not less than 12 months after 
birth, unless otherwise justified , and will report the outcome to the sponsor and IRB/EC.  
If any adverse pregnancy outcome (eg, the outcome of the pregnancy is stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, or fetal malformations ), it should be considered as an SAE and be 
reported in accordance with SAE reporting requirements.

Definitions  
Women of Childbearing Potential: premenopausal females who are anatomically and 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant following menarche.  
Women of Non childbearing  Potential:  
1. Surgically sterile:  females who are permanently sterile via hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy , and/or bilateral oophorectomy by reported medical 
history and/or medical records. Surgical ste rilization to have occurred a minimum 
of 6 weeks, or at the investigator ’s discretion, prior to screening . 
2. Postmenopausal: f emales at least 45 years of age with amenorrhea for 12 months 
without an alternative medical reason with confirmatory follicle -stimulating 
hormone (FSH) levels of ≥40 mIU/mL. The amenorrhea should not be induced by a medical condition such as anorexia nervosa, hypothyroid disease or polycystic ovarian disease, or by extreme exercise. It should not be due to concomitant medications that may have induced the amenorrhea such as oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotropin-releasing hormones, anti-estrogens, or selective estrogen receptor modulators. Females on hormone replacement therapy with FSH levels <40 mIU/mL may be included at the discretion of the investigator.   
Fertile male: a male that is considered fertile after puberty.  
Infertile male: permanently sterile male via bilateral orchiectomy.  
Contraception Guidance  
Female Subjects  
Female subjects who are of nonchildbearing potential will not be required to use contraception. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods (1 primary and 1 secondary method) of birth control from the time of signing the ICF until 
90 days after the follow-up visit. Primary (non-barrier) methods of contraception include: 
• surgical method performed at least 3 months prior to the screening  visit: 
o bilateral tubal ligation  or bilateral salpingectomy  
o Essure
® (hysteroscopic bilateral tubal occlusion) with confirmation of 
occlusion of the fallopian tubes 
• non-hormonal intrauterine device or Mirena® (other hormonal intrauterine devices 
will not be allowed) in place for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of the study drug 
• vasectomized male partner (sterilization performed at least 90 da ys prior to the 
screening  visit, with verbal confirmation of surgical success, and the sole partner for 
the female subject)  
Protocol Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January  2022 Page 58 of 67 Secondary (barrier) methods of contraception include: 
•male condom with out spermicide
•female condom with out spermicide
•cervical cap with out spermicide (as prescribed )
•diaphragm with out spermicide (as prescribed ).
Female subjects of childbearing potential should refrain from donation of ova from check -in 
(Day -2 or Day -4 depending on the clinical site’s requirement for COVID -19 testing) until 
90 days after the follow-up visit. 
Male Subjects  
Male subjects  (even with  a history of vasectomy) with partners of childbearing potential must 
use a male barrier method of contraception (ie, male condom without spermicide) in addition 
to a second method of acceptable contraception from check -in until 90 days after the 
follow-up visit. Acceptable methods of contraception for female partners include:  
•hormonal injection
•combined oral contraceptive pill or progestin/progestogen-only pill
•combined hormonal patch
•combined hormonal vaginal ring
•surgical method (bilateral tubal ligation or Essure® [hysteroscopic bilateral tubal
occlusion])
•hormonal implant
•hormonal or non-hormonal intrauterine device
•cervical cap with out spermicide
•diaphragm with out spermic ide.
An acceptable second method of contraception for male subjects is vasectomy that has been performed at least 90 days prior to the screening visit with verbal confirmation of surgical success.  
For male subjects  (even with a history of vasectomy), sexual intercourse with female partners 
who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be avoided unless condoms are used from the time of the first dose until 90 days after the follow-up visit. Male subjects are required to refrain from donation of sperm from check -in until 90 days after the follow-up visit. 
Sexual Abstinence and Same -sex Relationships 
Subjects who practice true abstinence, because of the subject’s lifestyle choice (ie, the subject should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation), are exempt from contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
Protocol Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 5.0, 12 January  2022 Page 59 of 67 postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a 
subject who is abstinent at the time of signing the ICF becomes sexually active they must agree to use contraception as described previously.  
For subjects who are exclusively in same-sex relationships, contraceptive requirements do not 
apply. If a subject who is in a same- sex relationship at the time of signing the ICF becomes 
engaged in a heterosexual relationship, they must agree to use contraception as described previously.

Any protocol amendments will require IRB/ EC approval before implementation of changes 
made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to 
study subjects.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents from the IRB/ HREC. All correspondence with HREC should be retained in the investigator file. A 
copy of /IRB/ HREC approval should be forwarded to the sponsor. 
The investigator will be r esponsible for the following: 
•Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/ EC annually or
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and proceduresestablished by the IRB/ EC.
•Notifying the IRB/ EC of SAE s or other significant safety findings as required by
IRB/ EC procedures.
•Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to
requirements of ICH guidelines, the IRB/ EC, and all other applicable local
regulations.
Regulatory Authority 
The s ponsor will obtain approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory agency

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October  2021  Page 2 of 10 The primary changes in this amendment, along with the rationale for each change as 
appropriate, are:  
1. Based on recommendations from the regulatory agency, the protocol was modified to add 
baseline QTc as a fixed effect in the concentration -QTc model  and a period effect (i.e., 
Day effect) to the mixed model for moxifloxacin by -timepoint analysis so that the 
analysis will be appropriate for the crossover design of the moxifloxacin and placebo 
parts of the study. 
2. To update the protocol to modify Inclusion Criterion 6a regarding  electrocardiogram 
findings for heart rate. The allowable range for  heart rate was changed  from  60 to 
100 bpm to 55 to 100 bpm. 
3. To modify the number of sites enrolling subjects in the study to include an additional site in the United States.  As a result , the regulatory and contact information was revised to 
include the I nstitutional R eview B oard (IRB), Investigator, and clinical laboratory in the 
United States. Revised serious adverse event reporting as needed. Removed mention of the specific pharmacy for the site in  Australia as there will be a pharmac y at each of the 
sites.  
4. Revised the bioanalytical laboratory contracted to perform the analysis for the study. 
5. Updated title to reflect the modification from a single site  to multiple sites . 
6. To modify the pharmacokinetic endpoints to remove the accumulation ratios. 
Minor changes:  
1. The protocol version and date were updated throughout the protocol. 
2. Typographical errors and formatting errors were corrected, as necessary.

QTcF for all subjects) will be included in this model as an additional covariate. If necessary, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using the model without this term.  
Section 8.3, Cardiodynamic ECG Analyses , By-Timepoint Analysis, paragraphs 1 and 2 
Previously read:  
The analysis for QTcF for CBP -307 versus placebo will be based on a linear mixed -effects 
model with change- from -basel ine QTcF (ΔQTcF) as the dependent variable, time (ie, 
postbaseline timepoints on Days 1, 6, and 15: categorical), treatment (therapeutic dose of CBP  307 and supratherapeutic dose of CBP-307 on Day 15, and corresponding placebo), and 
time-by-treatment inter action as fixed effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be 
specified for the repeated measures at postdose timepoints within subjects. If the model with unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices such as compound symmetry and autoregressive will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean , SE,  and 2-
sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the contrast “CBP-307 versus placebo” for each day of Days 1, 6, and 15 at each postbaseline timepoint on Days 1, 6, and Day 15, r espectively.  
The by -time point analysis for QTc F will be also performed for moxifloxacin versus placebo at 
postbaseline timepoints on Day 1 and Day 16. A linear mixed -effects model will be used with 
ΔQTcF as the d ependent variable and time (ie, postbaseline time points on Days 1 and 16: 
categorical), treatment (moxifloxacin and placebo), sequence (placebo/moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin/placebo), and time -by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be specified for the repeated measures at postbaseline time points for 
subject within visit. The model will also include a subject- specific random effect. If the model 
with an unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices, such as compound symmetry or autoregressive, will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean, SE,  
and 2- sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the contrast “moxifloxacin versus placebo” at each 
postbaseline time point , respectively .

Study Title  
A Phase I, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -blind, Double-dummy, Placebo - and 
Positive -Controlled Study to Investigate the Effects of CBP-307 on the QT C Interval in 
Healthy Subjects  
Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic CBP -307 plasma 
concentrations on the heart- rate corrected QT interval (QTc) in healthy subjects.  
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To demonstrate assay sensitivity of the study to detect a small QT effect using 
moxifloxacin as a positiv e control. 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses of CBP-307 in healthy subjects. 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of CBP -307 following administration of 
therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses in healthy subjects. 
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses of 
CBP -307 on heart rate (HR), PR and QRS intervals, and T-wave morphology. 
Study Design  
This will be a Phase I, randomized, double- blind, doubl e-dummy, placebo-controlled, 
positive-controlled, multi- site, 3 -arm study to investigate the effects of therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic oral doses of CBP-307 on the QTc interval in healthy male and female 
subjects.  
Potential subjects will be asked to read  and sign an informed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eligibility to enter the study will be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported. After placebo administration to all subjects on Day -1, all adverse events (AEs), whether volunteered, elicited, or noted upon physical examination, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from Day -1 until the end of the study).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be 
randomized into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub-groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 16 subjects. Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the morning on 
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 8 of 67 Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and on Day 16 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on 
Day -1).  
The following treatments will be administered: 
• Starting doses of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  followed by an up- titrated 
dose of 0.1 mg on Day 2) 
• A therapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.2 mg, Days 3 to 6) 
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.5 mg, Days 7 to 15) 
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and CBP-307) 
• Moxifloxacin (400 mg)  
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study 
with an expected peak QT effect (placebo -corrected change- from -baseline QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec. 
Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects  will be admitted into the study site on Day  -2 
and will remain at the study site until discharge on Day  19. Treatment administration will 
occur on Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and 16 under fasting conditions (all subjects will receive placebo on Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring and 
recording will begin at least 25  hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day 1 
and continue through 24 hours after the administration of study treatments on Day s 1, 6, 15, 
and 16 and at corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day -1. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint. Additional PK samples will be collected  at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on 
Day 15 . Subjects will return to the study site for a follow-up visit on Day 29±2  days.  
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on D ay 1). Continuous 
cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Days -1, 1, 6, 15, and 16. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day -1. Replicate 12 -lead ECGs will be extracted from  the continuous recording prior to 
dosing (-30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected at the following timepoints: prior to dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day (Days 1, 6, 
15, and 16; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5 hours postdose, ±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes for 12 to 24 hours postdose). Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15 (sample collection window: ±30 minutes ). Subjects will be 
inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which will end immediately prior to the PK sampling. At each timepoint, up to 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time 
window (the last 5 minutes of the 15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 9 of 67 supine, quiet position). The ECG effects of CBP-307 will be tested on data from Day -1 
(baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo), and Day 15 (supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be evaluated using ECG data collected on Days -1, 1, 15, and 16. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to 
treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clin ical laboratory tests, safety 12 -lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at screening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow-up visit. In addition, subjects will be monitored via cardiac telemetry at specif ic timepoints during the treatment period.  
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening through follow-up visit) is anticipated to be approximately 59 days.  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first subject signs  an ICF. The point of 
enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled). 
Number of Subjects  
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 3 0% for each sex) will be randomized into 
2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 16 subjects. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion 
Healthy male and female  subjects aged between 18 and 60 years (inclusive) with a body mass 
index between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m
2 (inclusive). 
Investigational Medicinal P roducts, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
The following treatments will be administered: 
• Starting doses of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  titrated to 0.1 mg on 
Day 2; oral capsule) 
• A therapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.2 mg, Days 3 to 6; oral capsule) 
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.5 mg, Days 7 to 15; oral capsule) 
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin , oral tablet and CBP-307; oral capsule ) 
• Moxifloxacin (400 mg ; oral tablet).

Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 10 of 67 Duration of Subject Participation in the Study  
Duration of subject participation from the screening visit through follow -up visit will be up to 
approximately 26 days for screening  period  (Days -28 to -3), 21 days for the in -house 
treatment  period (Days -2 to 19), and 10 ±2 days for follow-up (Day 29± 2 days) , in total 
approximately 59 days.  
Endpoints  
Electrocardiogram (Cardiodynamic):  
The primary cardiodynamic endpoint is the change- from -baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF).  
The secondary cardiodynamic  endpoints are: 
• Change- from -baseline HR, PR, QRS ( ∆HR, ∆ PR, and ∆ QRS);  
• Placebo -corrected change- from -baseline HR, QTcF, PR, and QRS ( ∆∆HR, ∆∆ QTcF, 
∆∆PR, and ∆∆ QRS);  
• Categorical outliers for QTcF, HR, PR, and QRS; 
• Frequency of treatment -emergent changes of T - wave morphology and U- wave 
presence.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of plasma concentrations of CBP -307. The 
PK parameters of CBP -307 will be calculated using a model independent approach. The 
following PK parameter endpoints will be calculated: maximum observed concentration 
(Cmax), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero  extrapolated  to infinity 
(AUC inf), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to 24 hours postdose 
(AUC 0-24), and time of the maximum observed  concentration (t max). Other noncompartmental 
parameters may be reported.  
Safety: 
Adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, clinical chemistry, uri nalysis), 
12lead ECGs , and vital signs measurements.  
Statistical Methods  
Cardiodynamic evaluation: The primary analysis will be based on concentration -QTc modeling of the relationship 
between plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and change- from -baseline QTcF  (∆QTcF) with 
the intent to exclude an effect of placebo -corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) >  10 msec at clinically 
relevant plasma levels. Placebo -corrected ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS , and ∆ QTcF (ΔΔHR, ΔΔPR, 
ΔΔQRS , and ∆∆ QTcF) will also be evaluated at each postdosing timepoin t ('by -timepoint' 
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 11 of 67 analysis). An analysis of categorical outliers will be performed for changes in HR, PR, QRS, 
QTcF, T -wave morphology, and U -wave presence. Assay sensitivity will be evaluated by 
concentration -QTc analysis of the effect on ∆ΔQTcF of moxifl oxacin using a similar model 
as for the primary analysis.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
The analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median , 
minimum, maximum geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation) separately by cohort. Individual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time 
data will be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data m ay be 
provided as well.  
Pharmaco kinet ic/electrocardiography analyses: 
The relationship between CBP-307 plasma concentrations and the change from ∆ QTcF will 
be evaluated using a linear mixed -effects modeling approach.  
Safety: 
All AEs  will be listed and treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized using the descriptive 
methodology. Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Observed values for clinical laboratory test data, 12lead ECGs , vital signs, and physical 
examination findings will be listed.

1.1. Disease  Background 
Autoimmune diseases are serious disorders that afflict a large portion of the world population; most have no cures. Significant advances have been made in the development of novel and disease-modifying therapies, but many of these new tre atments have significant 
side effects. Treatments are needed that provide better risk -to-benefit profiles than the 
existing therapeutic choices.  
T cells are important immune cells that mediate the development of autoimmune disorders. Migration of T cells from lymphoid tissues to the sites of inflammation is central to the functions of T cells, and this process is dependent on sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1P1) which  is known to ameliorate a variety of autoimmune diseases in animals and 
humans. Down modulation of this receptor, using S1P1 agonists, prevents T cell egress and results in a reduced number of circulating lymphocytes, particularly the CD4+- and CD8+-naïve and central -memory T cell subsets.  
1.2. Overview of CBP -307 
CBP -307 is an S1P1  agonist that is being developed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases 
by Suzhou Connect Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. CBP -307 (1 -(2-fluoro -4-(5-(4-isobutylphenyl)-
1,2,4-oxadiazol-3- yl) benzyl)  azetidine -3-carboxylic acid hemihydrate) is a potent, selective, 
small-molecule agonist of S1P1 and S1P5 receptor s. Cell -based assays have confirmed 
CBP -307 induces internalization of S1P1 from the cell surface. This is consistent with the 
known mechanism of action of other S1P1 agonists, in that they down-modulate S1P1 and inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues.  
1.2.1. Summary of Clinical Experience  
The Phase 1 development of CBP-307 comprised 2 completed studies in healthy subjects: 
• A single and multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of  
CBP -307 including pharmacokinetic ( PK), pharmacodynamic ( PD), and food- effect 
assessments (Study CBP -307AU001) 
• A single -dose and multiple-dose, and fixed- dose titration study to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of CBP -307 including PK and PD  (Study CB P-307CN001) 
Currently, CBP-307 is being evaluated in 2 Phase 2 studies:  
• Ongoing multicenter study in subjec ts with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis 
(Study  CBP -307CN002) to compare the clinical efficacy by evaluating the clinical 
response to CBP-307 versus placebo and the clinical remission and mucosal healing

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 19 of 67 achieved by CBP -307 versus placebo and to compare the clinical safety and 
tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo. 
• Ongoing study in subjec ts with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease compares clinical 
efficacy by evaluating the clinical response to CBP -307 versus placebo and the 
clinical remission and mucosal healing achieved by CBP -307 versus placebo and to 
compare the clinical safety and tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo. 
1.2.1.1.  Safety  
Study CBP-307AU001 
A total of 44 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. There were 28 subjects evaluated 
using the single -dose regimen (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 2.5 mg CBP -307) of which  21 subjects 
received CBP -307 and 7 subjects received placebo. Anothe r 16 healthy subjects were 
evaluated using the multiple -dose regimen (0.15 and 0.25 mg CBP -307 given once daily 
[QD] for 28  consecutive days ) of which 12 subjects received  CBP -307 and 4 subjects 
received placebo.  
Overall,  no unexpected safety signals were identified  and no deaths occurred in this study. 
For the single -dose regiment, no subject s were discontinued due to a treatment -emergent AE 
(TEAE). In the multiple -dose regimen, there were 2 subjects who were discontinued from the 
study (due to increased alanine transaminase and second degree AV block [not considered to be clinically significant, as judged by the investigator]) . All TEAEs resolved by the end of 
the study. 
In the single -dose regimen groups, TEAEs  were reported in 12 of 21 subjects (57.1%) tr eated 
with CBP -307 and in 3 of 7 subjects (42.8%) treated with placebo. Most (91.7%) of the 
TEAEs in these subjects were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in the 
CBP -307-treated groups were headache (28.6%); dizziness (19.0%); and bradycardia (9.5%). 
Bradycardia was reported only in 2 subjects receiving the highest (2.5 mg) CBP -307 dose. 
One subject had a serious adverse event (SAE) of bradycardia (associated with transient asystole) following a single  dose of 2.5 mg CBP -307. 
In the multiple -dose regi men groups, CBP-307 at doses of 0.15 and 0.25 mg QD was 
generally well tolerated over the 28 days of dosing. Treatment-e mergent AEs were reported 
in 11 of 12 subjects (91.7%) in the CBP-307 groups and 2 of 4 subjects (50.0%) in the placebo groups. Most (83.3% ) TEAEs were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in 
the 2 CBP-307 groups were headache (50.0%), and fatigue, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain (16.7% each). The incidences of these TEAEs were similar in both CBP -307- treated groups. 
No SAEs were re ported for subjects in the multiple-dose regimen. 
Study CBP-307CN001 
A total of 30 eligible subjects completed 3 CBP -307 dose groups in ascending order of dose 
after randomization (in a ratio of 1:1:1): Group A (0.1 mg), Group B (0.2 mg), and Group C 
(0.3 mg). Each dose group consisted of 10 subjects, including 8 subjects receiving the investigational drug and 2 subjects receiving placebo by random assignment. The administration started from the dose of 0.1 mg. The subjects in this group received a single

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 20 of 67 dose of CBP-307 or placebo and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 
7 days. Then the subjects received 0.1 mg CBP-307 or placebo QD for 14 consecutive days 
and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days. Dose escalation did not occur until the review of the single- dose regimen safety data from the 6  subjects in the 
previous dose cohort, and the safety data did not meet the termination criteria.  The subjects in 
the dose of 0.3 mg received fi xed-dose titration regimen , ie, 0.05 mg CBP-307 or placebo QD 
for 3  consecutive days; 0.1 mg CBP-307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days; 0.2 mg 
CBP -307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days; finally,  0.3 mg CBP-307 or placebo QD  for 
14 consecutive days, and the subjects were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days. 
Overall, no unexpected safety signals were identified, and there were no deaths, SAEs, or 
AEs leading to the subject’s early withdrawal from the study after administration of CBP -307. In the safety set, a total of 29 subjects (8 in Group A, 100%; 8 in Group B, 100%; 
8 in Group C, 100% and 5 in placebo group, 83.3%) experienced TEAEs. 
During the single -dose period, a total of 14 subjects (5 of 8 in Group A, 62.5%; 6 of 8 in 
Group B, 75%, and 3 of 4 in placebo group, 75%) developed AEs. T he incidence of TEAEs 
in Group A was generally similar to the placebo group. Among TEAEs in Group B, the 
incidence of AEs related to abnormalities in investigations was higher than that in placebo group, including lymphocyte count decreased (12.5%), white blood cell ( WBC ) count 
decreased (12.5%), neutrophil count decreased ( 12.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased 
(25%), and gamma- glutamyltransferase increased (12.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased (12.5%). Additionally, 1 subject experienced heart rate (HR) decreased (12.5%). 
During dose-titration period, 2 subjects (2 of 8 in Group C, 25%) experienced TEAEs. The 
TEAEs reported in Group C during the titration period included cough (12.5%) and increased upper airway secretion (12.5%). There were no TEAEs in the placebo group during this period. 
During repeated -dose period, a total of 28 subjects (8 of 8 in Group A, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group 
B, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group C, 100%; and 4 of 6 in placebo group, 66.7%) experienced AEs. 
The most frequent TEAE in Group A was uppe r respiratory tract infection ( 37.5%) compared 
with placebo group; the most frequent TEAEs in Group B and Group C included decreased lymphocyte count (Group B, 87.5%; Group C, 100.0%), WBC  count ( Group  B, 87.5%; 
Group C, 62.5%), and neutrophil count (Group B, 50%; Group C, 12.5%). The TEAEs noted in Group B during the repeated-dose period also included increased alanine aminotransferase (25%), gamma -glutamyltransferase (37.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase (12.5%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (12.5%), influenza (12.5%), chest pain (12.5%), lethargy (25%), and neck pain (12.5%); TEAEs in Group C during the repeated-dose period also included increased alanine aminotransferase (25%), decreased HR  (12.5%), and mouth ulcer (12.5%); 
the TEAEs in placebo group included increased transaminase (16.7%), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (1/6, 16.7%), decreased hemoglobin (16.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (16.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), dizziness (16.7%), and palpitations (16.7%).

1.2.1.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
CBP -307 given orally as a single dose was readily absorbed; drug concentrations peaked at 
approximately 6  hours after administration, with an elimination apparent terminal elimination 
half-life (t1/2) of approximately 25 hours (range of 23 to 29 hours). The time to maximum 
observed concentration  (C max) in the blood was delayed from 6 hours to approximately 
10 hours when CBP-307 was given with a high-fat diet. Food consumption also increased 
exposure ( Table 1). 
For the single -dose ad ministration, CBP -307 exposure (based on C max and area under the 
concentration -time curve  [AUC s]) increased with increasing dose following a single-dose 
administration  (Table 1).

1.3. Overview of Moxifloxacin 
Moxifloxacin is a broad -spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that binds to and inhibits the 
hERG IKr  α subunit and causes a mean increase of the QTc interval of 6 ms after a single 
400-mg oral dose. Moxifloxacin is commonly used as a positive control in thorough QT (TQT) studies to satisfy the requirements of International Council for/Conference on 
Harmo nisation  (ICH) E14.  
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert of AVELOX (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) tablets for additional information.

1.4. Study Rationale 
Regulatory guidance (ICH E14) has emphasized the need to obtain clear robust data on the effect of new chemical entities on electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters with focus on cardiac 
repolarization as measured by  the QTc duration. Though many Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials may be 
conducted they usually have an insufficient sample size, infrequent sampling of ECG data, or the use of inadequate controls to overcome the high rate of spontaneous change in QTc duration. This has resulted in regulatory guidance recommending a dedicated or thorough trial to define the ECG effects of new drugs. 
This study will be done in healthy subjects to eliminate variables  (concomitant drugs, 
diseases, etc.)  known to have an effect on ECG parameters. A supratherapeutic dose of 
CBP -307 is required to mimic the exposure in healthy subjects that may occur in the target 
population under the worst of circumstances (eg, concomitant use of cytochrome P450 
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 23 of 67 [CYP ]3A4 inhibitor, concomitant liver disease, presence of heart disease, taking more than 
the clinical dose prescribed) and to allow for PK to QTc modeling to assess the effect of drug 
concentration on cardiac repolarization. 
1.5. Benefit -risk Assessment  
Healthy subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyo nd that of an 
assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study . The risks of participation 
are primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there 
may also be some discomfort from the collection of blood samples and other study procedures. More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs associated with CBP -307 may be found in the I B.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This will be a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo -controlled, 
positive-controlled, multi- site, 3- arm study to investigate  the effect s of therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic oral doses of CBP-307 on the QTc interval in he althy male and fe male 
subjects.  
Potential subjects will be asked to read and sign an informed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eligibility to enter the study will be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After informed consent has 
been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only SAEs  will be 
reported. After placebo  administration to all subjects on Day -1, all AEs, whether

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 25 of 67 volunteered, elicited, or noted upon physical examination, will be recorded throughout the 
study (ie , from Day -1 until the end of the study ).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects ( at least  30% for each sex ) will be 
randomized into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub-groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 16 subjects. Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the mornin g on 
Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and on Day 16 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on Day -1).  
The follow ing treatments will be administered: 
• Starting doses of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  followed by an up- titrated 
dose of 0.1 mg on Day 2) 
• A therapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.2 mg, Days 3 to 6) 
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.5 mg , Day s 7 to 15) 
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and  CBP -307) 
• Moxifloxacin ( 400 mg)  
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study

of 10 to 15 msec.  
An overview of the study design is shown in Figure  1. 
Figure  1: Study Schematic  
 
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 
32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 
16 subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive a treatment sequence that includes 4 treatments (CBP -307 therapeutic 
dose, CBP -307 supratherapeutic dose,  moxifloxacin, or placebo [matched to CBP -307 or moxifloxacin]) ; assigned study 
treatment s will be administered on Day 1,  Day 2,  Days 3 to 6, Days  7 to 15, and Day 16. Dosing  details are provided in 
Table 3. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected predose  and at each post dose cardiodynamic 
electrocardiogram timepoint. Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours  following dosing on Day 15. An 
end-of -study visit will occur on Day 29 ±2 days . Day 19

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 26 of 67 Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the stu dy site on Day -2 
and will remain at  the study site until discharge on Day  19. Treatment administration will 
occur on Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and 16 under fasting conditions (all subjects will receive placebo on Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic ECG monitoring and recording will begin at least 25 hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day 1 and continue through 
24 hours after the administration of study treatments  on Days 1, 6, 15, and 16 and at 
corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day -1. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint.  
Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15. Subjects will return to the study site for a follow -up visit on Day 29±2  days.  
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on Day 1). Continuous cardiodynamic monitoring  (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Days -1, 1, 6, 15, and 
16. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day -1. Replicate 12 -lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to 
dosing (-30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected at the following timepoints: prior to d osing 
and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day ( Days  1, 6, 
15, and 16; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5 hours postdose, ±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes for 12 to 24 hours postdose). Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15 (sample collection window: ±30 minutes ). Subjects will be 
inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes  prior to and 5 minutes after each 
cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which will end immediately prior to the PK sampling. At each timepoint, up to 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time 
window (the last 5 minutes of the 15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine, quiet position). The ECG effects of CBP -307 will be tested on data from Day -1 
(baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo), and Day 15 (supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be 
evaluated using ECG data collected on Days -1, 1, 15, and 16. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central ECG laborat ory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, safety 1 2-lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at s creening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow-up visit. In addition, subjects will be monitored via cardiac telemetry at specific timepoints during the treatment period.  
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening  through follow-up 
visit) is anticipated to be approximately 59 days .

the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled). 
A Schedu le of Assessments is presented in  Appendix 6. 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for CBP -307 to cause QT prolongation. 
As CBP -307 exposure affects heart rate, the primary endpoint for this study will be the QTcF. 
The study will be randomized and double-blind because randomization eliminates 
confounding by baseline variables and blinding el iminates confounding by co-interventions, 
thus eliminating the possibility that the observed effects of the intervention are because of 
differential use of othe r treatments.  
The sample size for this study is based on a formal statistical power calculation . 
Conducting the study in healthy subjects mitigates the potential confounding effects of the disease state and concomitant medications.  Both male and female subjects will be included to 
eliminate similar known ECG variability effects.  
Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP-307, subjects will be fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 4 hours postdose on the days when PK samples are collected . 
Pharmacokinetic assessments of CBP -307 concentrations in plasma will be evaluated during 
the study. The timepoints for the PK sample collections are based on previous studies and are considered adequate to allow for the characterization of the drug’s PK af ter oral dosing. 
Furthermore, the chosen PK sample collection for CBP-307 is anticipated to be sufficient to allow reasonable estimation of t
1/2 during the terminal elimination phase.  
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
According to ICH E14, the highest thera peutic dose and a supratherapeutic dose are 
recommended for the QT/QTc study. The CBP -307 doses of 0.2 and 0.5 mg were chosen for 
evaluation in this study based on observed PK results in completed Phase 1 studies. To carefully monitor safety following the administration of CBP -307 doses in Group 1, CBP -307 
doses will be up- titrated as follows: subjects will r eceive a s tarting dose of 0.05 mg CBP -307 
on Day 1 followed by an up- titrated dose of 0.1 mg on Day 2 and a dose of 0.2 mg on 
Days  3 to 6. Prior clinic al experience with CBP -307 has not demonstr ated clinically 
significant abnormalities in laboratory test results in the majority of subjects or a dose-response relationship for safety based on AEs. 
A single dose of 0.5 mg is the planned supratherapeutic dos e, which balances the 
characteristics of the study design with the safety of healthy subject s. Testing of CBP-307 at 
substantial multiples of the anticipated maximum therapeutic exposure is not clinically 
warranted due to the known safety and tolerability profile of CBP -307.

master f ile. 
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
A subject is free to withdraw their informed consent from th e study at any time  or they may 
be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or the sponsor for safety, 
behavioral, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol-required visits or 
procedures . In addition, a subject will be withdrawn from dosing if any of the following 
criteria are met:  
• change in compliance with any inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant 
and affects subject safety  as determined by the investigator  (or designee) 
• noncompliance with the study restrictions that might affect subject safety or study 
assessments/objectives, as considered applicable by the investigator (or designee) 
• any clinically relevant sign or symptom that, in the opinion of the investigator (or 
designee) , warrants subject withdrawal . 
If a subject is withdrawn from dosing, the sponsor will be notified and the date and reason(s) for the withdrawal will be documented in the subject’ s electronic c ase report f orm (e CRF). If 
a subject is withdrawn  from the study, efforts will be made to perform all follow -up 
assessments, if possible ( Appendix 6).  Other procedures may be performed at  the 
investigator ’s (or designee’s) and/or sponsor ’s discretion. If the subject is in -house, these 
procedures should be performed before the subject is discharged from the clinic. The investigator  (or designee) may also request that the su bject return for an additional follow-up 
visit. All withdrawn subjects will be followed until resolution of all their AEs or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the in vestigator (or designee) to have stabilized.  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow-up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.

All supplies of the IMP, both bulk and subject- specific, will be stored in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s or pharmacy’s instructions. Until dispensed to the subjects, the study 
treatments will be stored at the study site in a location that is locked with restricted access.  
5.2. Study Treatment Administration  
Each dose of study treatment ( CBP -307, placebo, or moxifloxacin) will be administered 
orally following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, with approximately 240 mL of room 
temperature water. Additio nally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP-307, 
subjects will be fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 4 hours postdose on the days when PK samples are collected . 
Subjects will be dosed in numerical orde r while sitting or standing but not be permitted to lie 
supine for 2 hours after treatment administration , except as necessitated by the occurrence of 
an AE(s) and/or study procedures. 
5.3. Randomization 
This is a  double-blind randomized study. Subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment 
sequences before administration of the first dose of study treatment . A randomization list will 
be generated by a statistician using a computer -generated pseudo-random permutation 
procedure. The randomiza tion date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and 
on the enrollment eCRF. A computer-generated randomization schedule and emergency 
code-break envelopes will be provided to the study site. Randomization details will be included in the randomization specification.

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 35 of 67 5.4. Blinding  
This is a double-blinded study. The following controls will be employed to maintain the 
double-blind status of the study: 
• The placebo will be identical in appearance to CBP -307 or moxifl oxacin.  
• The investigator and other members of staff involved with the study will remain blinded to the treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure. 
• Interim bioanalytical data will be provided to Labcorp  Early Clinical Biometrics  in a 
blinded manner. 
To maintain the blind, the investigator will be provided with a sealed randomization code for each subject, containing coded details of the treatment. These individual ly sealed envelopes 
will be kept in a limited access area that is accessible 24 hours a day. If, in order to manage subject safety or to support dose escalation dec isions (in the event of possibly 
treatment -related SAEs or severe AEs), the decision to unblind resides solely with the 
investigator. Whenever possible, and providing it does not interfere with or delay any decision in the best interest of the subject, the investigator will discuss the intended code-break with the sponsor. If it becomes necessary to break the code during the study, the date, time, and reason will be recorded in the subject's source data and on the individual envelope and will be witnessed by a second person. 
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance:  
• All doses will be administered under the supervision of suitably qualified study site 
staff. 
• Immediately after dose administration, visual inspection of the mouth and hands will be performed for each subject . 
• At each dosing occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of IMP will be performed.   
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The investigator (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of study treatments (CBP -307, moxifloxacin, placebo- matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched 
moxifloxacin)  received. In addition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, 
specifying the am ount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensing. This drug 
accountability record will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original drug accountability record will be available for review by the sponsor upon request. 
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarded upon 
satisfactory completion of the compliance and accountability procedures. Any unused assembled unit doses will be retained until the completion of the study.

placebo -matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched moxifloxacin) will be disposed of by the 
study site ’s pharmacy, per the sponsor ’s written instructions.  If destruction is authorized to 
take place at the study site ’s pharmacy, the investigator must ensure that the materials are 
destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations and institutional policy. 
All study drug destructions must be adequately documented. 
6. CONCOMITANT THERAPIES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS  
6.1. Concomitant Therapies  
Subjects will refrain from the use of any prescription  or nonprescription medication s/products 
during the study until the follow-up visit, unless the investigator  (or designee)  and/or sponsor 
have given their prior consent. Medications taken within 28 days before study treatment 
administration will be documented as a prior treatment. Treatments taken after study treatment administration will be documented as concomitant treatments.  
Paracetamol/acetaminophen  (2 g/day for up to 3 consecutive days ) is an  acceptable 
concomitant medication . The administration of any other concomitant medications during the 
study is prohibited without prior approval of the investigator  (or designee) , unless its use is 
deemed necessary for the treatment of an AE . Any medication taken by a subject during the 
course of the study and the reason for its use will be documented in the source data.  
Females will refrain from the use of hormone replacement therapy  and oral, implantable, 
transdermal, injectable, or intrauterine hormonal contraceptives (with the exception of 
Mirena
®) during the study until the follow-up visit ( Appendix 4). 
6.2. Diet 
While confined at the study site, subjects will receive a standardized diet at scheduled times 
that do not conflict with other study- related activities. Subjects will be  fasted overnight ( at 
least 10 hours ) before the collection of blood samples for c linical laboratory evaluations . 
On the days with PK assessments ( Appendix 6), the subje cts will be fasted  overnight ( at least  
10 hours) prior to dosing and refrain from consuming water from 1 hour predose until  1 hour 
postdose, excluding the amount of water consumed at dosing. Food is allowed from 4 hours 
postdose. At all other times during the study, subjects may consume water ad libitum. 
Foods and beverages containing poppy seeds , grapefruit , or Seville oranges will not be 
allowed from 7 days prior to check -in until follow-up visit on Day 29±2 days . 
Consumption of c affeine/xanthine-containing foods and beverages will not be allowed from 
48 hours before check -in until discharge on Day 19. 
Consumption of alcohol will not be permitted from 72 hours prior to check -in until discharge 
on Day 19 and alcohol intake will be limited to a maximum of 2 units/day on all other days, 
whilst not at the study site, from screening  to 72 hours prior to the follow-up visit on 
Day 29±2 days.

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 37 of 67 6.3. Smoking  
Subjects will not be permitted to  use tobacco - or nicotine-containing products within 
3 months prior to check -in until the follow-up visit . 
6.4. Exercise  
Subjects are required to refrain fr om strenuous exercise from 7 days  before check -in until the 
follow-up visit ( Day 29±2 days) and will otherwise maintain their normal level of physical 
activity during this time (ie, will not begin a new exercise program nor participate in any 
unusually strenuous physical exertion). 
6.5. Blood Donation 
Subjects are required to refrain from donation of blood from 3 months prior to screening, 
plasma from 2 weeks prior to screening, and platelets from 6 weeks prior to screening until 3 months after the follow-up visit. 
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures as closely as possible to the 
nominal time, givin g considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, 
and the other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. 
The highest priority procedures will be performed closest to the nominal time. The order of 
priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority): 
• dosing 
• continuous ECG extraction window 
• pharmacokinetic blood samples  
• safety assessments  
• any other procedures . 
This study includes a screening period (Day -28 to Day -3), a treatment peri od (Days -2 to 
19), and a follow-up period (Day 29 ±2 days ).  
The defined abnormal vital sign measurements (Exclusion Criteria #4) at check -in (Day - 2) 
or baseline (Day -1 predose) will only be considered exclusionary if judged applicable by the investigator. For confirmation of enrollment eligibility based on pulse rate, the pulse rate 
assessed by vital signs, rather than the 12-lead ECG, will be used. For all subjects, the screen ing, check -in, or baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate may be 
repeated after 5 to 10 minutes if the initial reading is believed to be atypical for the subject.

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 38 of 67 7.1. General Assessments  
7.1.1. Demographics 
Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order 
to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.  
7.1.2. Medical History  
At the timepoint specified in Appendix 6, the i nvestigator or designee will collect a complete 
medical and surgical history. Medical history will include information on the subject’s concurrent medical conditions and any events occurring prior to the first dose of study treatment. All findings will be recorded on the medical history eCRF.  
7.2. Electrocardiography Assessments  
7.2.1. Continuous 12 -lead Electrocardiogram Recording  
Continuous 12- lead digital ECG recording will be performed as specified in Appendix 6. All 
ECG data will be collected using a Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG continuous 12- lead 
digital recorder. The 12-lead Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG equipment will be supplied and supported by ERT (eResearch  Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA). The continuous 
12-lead digital ECG data will be stored onto SD memory cards.  
The ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected by pred etermined timepoints as defined 
in Appendix 6 and will be read centrally by ERT  (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, 
PA). The following principles will be followed in ERT’s core laboratory: 
• ECG analysts are blinded to the subject, visit, and treatment allocation.  
• Baseline and on -treatment ECGs for a particular subject will be over -read on the same 
lead and will be analyzed by the same reader.  
The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analy zable, then the primary lead of 
analysis will be changed to another lead for the entire subject data set.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be extracted in up to 10 replicates at the predefined timepoints and 
subjects will be inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each nominal time.  
7.2.1.1.  TQT Plus Extraction Technique  
Ten 14-second digital 12-lead ECG tracings will be extracted from the continuous Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) recordings using the ‘TQT Plus method’, a computer- assisted and 
statistical process utilized by ERT. The method enables extraction of ECGs with the lowest HR variability and  noise within the protocol- specified extraction time window ( eg, the HR 
and QT changes from beat -to-beat in the range of <10 %). At each protocol- specified 
timepoint, 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute “ECG window” (typically, 
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 39 of 67 the last 5 minutes of the 15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine, quiet 
position).  
7.2.1.2.  Expert  Precision QT Analysis  
Expe rt precision QT analysis will be performed on all analyzable (non- artifact) beats in the 
10 ECG replicates. Statistical quality control procedures  are used to review and assess all 
beats and identify “high” and “low” confidence beats using several criteria, including: 
• QT or QTc values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely). 
• RR values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely). 
• Rapid changes in QT, QTc, or RR from beat- to-beat.  
Measurements of all primary ECG parameters (QT, QTc, RR) in all recorded beats of all replicates that are deemed “high confidence” will be performed using COMPAS software. All low -confidence beats will be reviewed manually and adjudicated using pass- fail criteria. 
The final QC assessment will be performed by a cardiologist. The beats  found acceptable by 
manual review will be included in the analysis. The median QT, QTc, and RR values fro m 
each extracted replicate will be calculated, and then the mean of all available medians from a nominal timepoint will be used as the subject’s reportable value at that timepoint.  
Categorical T -wave morphology analysis and the measurement of PR and QRS interval of the 
ECG (QRS) intervals will be performed manually in 3 of the 10 ECG replicates at each timepoint. Each fiducial point (onset of P-wave, onset of Q-wave, offset of S- wave, and 
offset of T -wave) will be electronically marked.  
For T -wave morphology and U- wave presence, treatment -emergent changes will be assessed 
(ie, changes not present at baseline). For each category of T-wave morphology and U- waves, 
the category will be de emed as present if observed in any replicate at the timepoint. For 
baseline, the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate from all timepoints that constitute baseline.  
7.2.2. Safety 12- lead Electrocardiogram  
Resting 12- lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine and at rest for at 
least 5  minutes at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. S ingle 
12-lead ECGs will be repeated twice, and an average taken of the 3 readings, if either of the 
following criteria applies : 
• QT interval corrected for HR  using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) is >500 ms  
• QTcF change from the baseline (predose) is >60 ms. 
Additional 12- lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinically 
appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of ECGs is required. The investigator (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of each 12 -lead 
ECG.

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 40 of 67 7.2.3. Cardiac Telemetry Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored via cardiac telemetry  from approximately 1 hour prior to dose 
administration and until approximately 12 hours postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7 (up- titration 
days; as described in Appendix 6). Based on the emerging safety data from the study, the 
duration of the telemetry may be extended if necessary.  
The start and stop date and time of the telemetry monitoring will be recorded in the eCRFs. 
Clinically significant abnormalities noted from telemetry monitoring will be confirmed by 12-lead ECG  if ne cessary , then after confirming, the abnormities will be reported as AEs in 
the eCRF.  
7.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments   
7.3.1. Pharmacokinetic  Blood Sample Collection and Processing 
Blood samples ( approximately 1  × 4 mL  for CBP -307 and moxifloxacin assays ) will be 
collected by veni puncture or cannulation at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments in  Appendix 6. Procedures for collection, processing, and shipping of PK blood 
samples will be detailed in a separate document .  
7.3.2. Analytical Methodology 
Plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and moxifloxacin will be determined using  a validated 
analytical procedure. Specifics of the analytical method  will be provided in a separate 
document.  
7.4. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
7.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions, assignment of severity and causality, and procedures for reporting 
SAEs are detailed in  Appendix 1. 
The condition of each subj ect will be monitored from the time of signing the ICF until the 
follow-up visit. Subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their condition by open questioning, such as “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”, at le ast once each day while resident at the study site and each study visit. Subjects 
will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during the study.  
All nonserious AEs, whether reported by the subject voluntarily or upon questioning, or noted on physical examination, will be recorded from initiation of placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) until study completion. If AEs that occur in the screening prior to 
placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) are considered to be related to the study 
procedure, they should be also collected. Serious AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the ICF until study completion.  The nature, time of onset, duration, and severity 
will be documented, together with an investigator ’s (or designee’s) opinion of the 
relationship to study treatment.

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 41 of 67 Adverse events recorded  during the course of the study will be  followed up, where possible, 
to resolution or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator (or designee ) to have 
stabilized. This will be completed at the investigator ’s (or designee’s) discretion. 
7.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations  at the times 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessmen ts in Appendix 6. Clinical laboratory evaluations are 
listed in Appendix 2. 
A serum qualitative pregnancy or urine test (females only) and follicle -stimulating hormone 
test (postmenopausal females only) will be performed at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix 6. A positive urine pregnancy test will be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. All pregnancies should be reported as specified in Appendix 1. 
Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be 
clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of  clinical laboratory safety evaluations is required. At the discretion of the 
investigator, clinically significant clinical laboratory assessments may be confirmed by repeat sampling. If the clinical significance is confirmed, subjects will be excluded from 
participation or, if already included, will be followed until normalization of the test result or for as long as the investigator considers necessary.  
Subjects will be asked to provide urine samples for drugs of abuse screen and cotinine test, and will undergo an alcohol breath test  at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
in Appendix 6. For all female subjects, a pregnancy test will be performed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6.   
An investigator  (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical laboratory data.  
7.4.3. Vital Signs  
Supine blood pressure, supine pulse rate, respiratory rate, and tympanic temperature will be 
assessed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Vital signs 
may also be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of vital signs is required.  
All measurements will be performed singly . For all subjects, the screening, check -in, or 
baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate may be repeated after 5 to 10 minutes if the initial reading  is believed to be atypical for the subject.  
Subjects must be supine for at least 5  minutes before blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements.  
7.4.4. Physical Examination 
A full physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of  
Assessments in Appendix 6. Physical examinations include general appearance, head, eyes,

gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, skin, and  others. 
Height, weight, and body mass index  will be assessed at screening.  
8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least  30% for each sex ) will be randomized into 
2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups 
(Group  2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 16 subjects. 
Sample S ize for Primary Analysis: 
A sam ple size of 28 evaluable subjects per treatment group will provide more than 94.4% 
power to exclude that CBP-307 causes more than 10- msec QTc effect at clinically relevant 
plasma levels, as shown by the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of the model- predicted QT effect (Δ ΔQTcF) at the observed geometric mean C
max of CBP -307 
in the study. This power is estimated approximately using a 2 -sample t -test. The calculation 
assumes a  1-sided 5% significance level, an underlying effect of CBP-307 of 3 msec and a 
standard deviation (SD) of the ΔQTcF of 8 msec for both CBP-307 and placebo treatment groups. Note that this calculation is  conservative, since it does not take into account any gain 
in precision due to the use of all data of each subject with the help of a linear mixed- effects  
model. The concentration-QTc analysis method is supported by  Darpo et al 2015
3 and 
Ferber  et al, 2015,4 and consistent with the experiences from 25 recent TQT studies. 
Sample Size Considerations for Assay Sensitivity:  
To demonstrate assay sensitivity with concentration- QTc analysis, it has to be shown that the 
ΔΔQTcF of a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin exceeds 5 msec (ie, the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc effect [ΔΔQTcF] should exceed 5 msec). In a similarly 
designed, recent crossover study with 24 healthy subjects  (on-file data, ERT) , the standard 
error (SE) for the prediction of the QT effect of moxifloxacin based on the exposure-response analysis was 1.24 msec. The within -subject SD of ΔQTcF in the referred study was 5.4 msec  
based on the by- timepoint analysis. If the effect of moxifloxacin is assumed to be 10  msec, 
the SE of 1.24 msec corresponds to an effect size of (10-5)/(1.24×sqrt[24])=0.82, where the effect size is the effect assumed under the alternative hypothesis divided by the SD of the test variable. This value should be compared to the effect size of 0.64 required to guarantee a power of at least 95% in a paired  t-test situation with a sample size of 28  evaluable subjects. 
In other words, based on this calculation, a power of at least 95% will be obtained as long as the variability of the ΔQTcF, as measured by its within -subject SD  from the by -timepoint 
analysis, does not exceed 6.9 msec (ie, 1 28% [= 0.82/0.64] of the 5.4 msec observed in the 
referred study  assuming the ratio of effective  sizes is consistent with inverse ratio of 
within -subject SD ). The number also agrees with recent recommendations of the FDA, which 
propose at least 20 subjects.

8.2.1. Cardiodynamic Population  
The QT/QTc population will include all subjects in the safety population with measurements 
at baseline as well as on -treatment with at least 1 postdose timepoint with a valid ΔQTcF 
value.  The QT/Q Tc population will be used for the by- timepoint and categorical analyses of 
the cardiodynamic ECG parameters.  
The PK/QTc population will include all subjects who are in both the QT/QTc and PK populations with at least 1 pair of postdose PK and ∆ QTcF  data from the same timepoint as 
well as subjects in the QT/QTc population who received placebo. The PK/QTc population will be used for the concentration- QTc analysis and assay sensitivity. PK/QTc population 
will be defined for CBP -307, and for moxifloxacin.  
The as -treated principle will be applied to all analysis populations mentioned below. 
8.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and have evaluable PK data of any of th e analytes (CBP -307 and moxifloxacin) . A 
subject will be excluded from the PK summary statistics and statistical analysis if the subject 
has an AE of vomiting that occurs at or before 2 times median time to maximum concentration.  
8.2.3. Safety Population 
The safety population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product drug (therapeutic and supra therapeutic doses of CBP-307, moxifloxacin, or placebo). 
8.3. Cardiodynamic ECG Analyses 
Baseline for Cardiodynamic ECG Assessments  
Baseline for the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 ( CBP -307 in Group 1 versus 
placebo  in Groups 2A and 2B ) will be time -matched values on Day -1.  
For assay sensitivity  in Groups 2A and 2B, the following baselines will be used: 
• Group 2A: For moxifloxacin administered  on Day 1 (defined as Period 1 Day 1), 
baseline will be Day 16 (defined as Period 1 Day -1), on which subjects are administer ed placebo. For placebo-correction in this group, placebo values will be 
derived from Day 15 (defined as P eriod 2 Day 1) on which subjects are administered 
placebo, and baseline will be obtained on Day -1 (defined as Period 2 Day -1). 
• Group 2B: For moxifloxacin administere d on Day 16 (defined as Period 2 Day 1), 
baseline will be Day 1  (defined as Period 2 Day - 1), on which subjects are 
administered  placebo. For the placebo-correction in this group, Day -1 (defined as

Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 44 of 67 Period 1 Day 1) values will be used as placebo (no treatment) and  baseline will be 
obtained on Day 15 (defined as Period 1 Day -1). 
Concentration- QTc Analysis (Primary Analysis) 
The relationship between CBP-307 plasma concentrations and change- from -baseline QTcF 
(∆QTcF) will be quantified using a linear mixed- effects modeling approach with ΔQTcF as 
the dependent variable, time- matched concentrations  of CBP -307 as the exploratory variate 
(0 for placebo), treatment (act ive=1 or placebo=0), and time (ie , postbaseline timepoints on 
Days 1, 6, and 15 categorical) as fixed effects , and a random intercept and slope per subject.6 
Centered baseline QTcF (i.e., baseline QTcF for individual subject minus the population 
mean baseline QTcF for all subjects) will be included in this model as an additional covariate. If necessary, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using the model without this term.  
The degrees of freedom estimates will be determined by the Kenward -Roger method. From 
the model, the slope (ie, the regression par ameter for the CBP -307 concentration) and the 
treatment effect -specific intercept will be estimated together with 2 -sided 90% CI . The 
estimates for the time effect will be reported with degrees of freedom and SE.  
For the assessment of the ECG effect of CB P-307 versus placebo, the time term incorporated 
into the models (both by-timepoint analysis and concentration -QTc analysis [or assay 
sensit ivity]) includes the single predose timepoint and all post dose time points on Days 1, 6, 
and 15, and Days 1 and 16 fo r active versus placebo and moxifloxacin versus placebo, 
respectively. All times are relative to the time of dosing on that day which is considered the 
first dose for the assay sensitivity analysis. For the analysis of CBP-307 versus placebo, the first dos e of study treatment is on Day 1. 
The geometric mean of the individual C
max values for CBP-307 concentrations for subjects in 
the active drug groups on each of Days 6 and 15 will be determined, respectively. The 
predicted effect and its 2 -sided 90% CI for placebo -corrected change -from -baseline QTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) (ie , slope estimate × concentration + treatment effect -specific intercept) at this 
geometric mean C max will be obtained.  
To evaluate the adequacy of model fit with respect to the assumption of linearity, the observed ΔQTcF values adjusted by population time effect estimated from the model will be used. These individual placebo- adjusted ΔQTcF
i,k (ΔΔQTcF i,k) values equal the observed 
individual ΔQTcF i,k for subject i administered with active drug or placeb o at timepoint k 
minus the estimated population mean pl acebo effect at timepoint k (ie, time effect). A decile 
plot, i e, plot of the deciles of observed concentrations and the mean placebo -adjusted ΔQTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) and 90% CI at the median concentration within each decile will be given. The regression line presenting the model- predicted ΔΔQTcF
7 will be added to evaluate the fit of a 
linear model and visualize the concentration -response relationship. The placebo -adjusted 
ΔQTcF i,j equals the individual ΔQTcF i,j for subject i administered with CBP -307 at timepoint 
j minus the estimation of time at timepoint j (ie , time effect). Additional exploratory analyse s 
(via graphical displays and/or model fitting) will include accounting for a delayed effect (hysteresis) and the justification for the choice of PD model (linear versus nonlinear) as 
follows. 
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 45 of 67 Criteria for N egative QT Assessment  
If the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc effect of ΔΔQTcF at the 
observed geometric mean C max on Days 6 and 15 as well as clinically relevant plasma levels 
is below 10 msec (ie,  the upper bound of the 2- sided 90% CI at the geometric mean C max 
<10 msec), it can be concluded that CBP-307 does not cause clinically concerning QT 
prolongation within the observed plasma concentration ranges .  
Investigation of H ysteresis  
Hysteresis will be assessed based on joint graphical displays of the least squares (LS) mean ΔΔQTcF  for each postbaseline timepoint and the mean concentration of CBP- 307 at the same 
timepoints. In addition, hysteresis plots will be given for LS mean ΔΔQTcF and the mean 
concentrat ions. If a QT effect (ΔΔQTcF) > 10 msec cannot be excluded from the by -timep oint 
analysis in the active dose groups on Days 6 and 15 ; and the mean peak ΔΔQTcF effe ct is 
observed at the same timepoint in the by- timepoint analysis in the active dose groups on 
Days  6 and 15; and if the difference ( delay ) between the time to reach the  peak QT c effect 
(ΔΔQTcF) and peak plasma concentration (t
max) in the plot (ΔΔQTcF versus CBP -307) of 
more than 1 hour is observed in a consisten t way for the active dose groups on Days 6 and 15, 
other concentration- QTc models, such as a model with an effect compartment, may be 
explored. With the provision stated above, hysteresis will be assumed if this curve shows a counterclockwise loop. A significant treatment effect- specific intercept may also be 
indicative of hysteresis  or model misspecification , if it cannot be explained by a nonlinear 
relationship. 
Appropriateness of a L inear Model 
To assess the appropriateness of a linear model, normal quantile-quantile plots for the 
standardized residuals and the random effects, scatter  plots of standardized residuals versus 
concentration and versus fitted values, and box plots of standardized residuals versus nominal time and versus active treatment will be produced. The scatter plot of standardized residuals versus concentration by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing ( LOESS ) fitting (ie , locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing
8 lines ) also will be produced with an optimal smoothing 
parameter selected by the Akaike information criterion with a correction.9 In addition, a 
scatter plot of observed concentration and ΔQTcF with a LOESS smooth line with 90% CI and a linear regression line will also be provided to check the assumption of a linear concentration -QTc relati onship. If there is an indication that a linear model is inappropriate, 
additional models may be fitted, such as an E -max model. The concentration -QTc analysis 
will then be repeated for the model found to best accommodate the nonlinearity detected.

Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by similar concentration -QTc analysis of 
moxifloxacin data. If the slope of the concentration -QTc (change -from -baseline QTcF) for 
moxifloxacin is statistically significant at 10% level for 2 -sided test and the lower bound of 
the 2 -sided 90% CI of the predicted effect is above 5 msec at the observed geometric mean 
C
max of the 400-mg dose, assay sensitivity will be deemed to have been demonstrated.

Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 26 October 2021  Page 46 of 67 By-Time point Analysis 
The analysis for QTcF for CBP -307 versus placebo will be based on a linear mixed -effects 
model with change- from -baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) as the dependent variable, time (ie, 
postbaseline timepoints on Days 1, 6, and 15: categorical), treatment (therapeutic dose of 
CBP -307 and supratherapeutic dose of CBP-307 on Day 15, and corresponding placebo), and 
time-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. Baseline QTcF will be included in this mod el 
as an additional covariate. If necessary, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using th e 
model without this term. An unstructured covariance matrix will be specified for the repeated 
measures at post dose timepoints within subjects. If the model with unstructured covariance 
matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices such as compound symmetry and autoregressive will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean , SE,  and 2 -sided 90% CIs 
will be calculated for the contrast “CBP -307 versus placebo” for each day of Days 1, 6, and 
15 at each postbaseline timepoint on Days 1, 6, and Day 15, respectively . 
The by -timepoint analysis for QTc F will be also performed for moxifloxacin versus placebo 
at post baseline timepoints on Day 1 and Day 16. A linear mixed -effects model will be used 
with ΔQTcF as the dependent variable and time (ie, postbaseli ne time points on Days 1 and 
16: categorical), treatment (moxifloxacin and placebo), period (as described in baseline definition for assay sensitivity), sequence (placebo/moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin /placebo), 
and time -by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. Baseline QTcF will be included in this 
model as an additional covariate.  If necessary, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using 
the model without this term.  An unstructured covariance mat rix will be specified fo r the 
repeated measures at postbaseline timepoints for subject within visit. The model will also include a subject -specific random effect. If the model with an unstructured covariance matrix 
fails to converge, other covariance matri ces, such as compound symmetry or autoregressive, 
will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean, SE,  and 2-sided 90% CIs will be 
calculated for the contrast “moxifloxacin versus placebo” at each postbaseline tim epoint on 
Day 1 , respectively . 
For HR, PR, and QRS intervals, the analysis will be based on the change- from -baseline 
postdose (ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS). The same (b y-timepoint analysis) model will be used as 
described for QTcF. The LS mean, SE, and 90% CI from the statistical modeling for both change- from- baseline and placebo -corrected change -from -baseline values will be listed in the 
tables and graphically displayed. 
Categorical Analyses The analysis results for categorical outliers, T -wave morphology, and U- wave presence will 
be summarized in frequency tables with counts (percentages) for both the number of subjects 
and the number of timepoints. For categorical outliers, the number (percentage) of subjects as well as time points who had increases in absolute QTcF values >450 and ≤480 msec, >480 
and ≤500 msec, or >500 msec, and changes from pre dose base line of >30 and ≤60 msec, or 
>60 msec; increase in PR from pre dose baseline > 25% to a PR > 200 msec; increase in QRS 
from pre dose baseline > 25% to a QRS > 120 msec; decrease in HR from predose baseline 
>25% to a n HR < 50 bpm; and increase in HR from pre dose baseline >25% to a n HR 
>100 bpm will be determined. For T-wave morphology and U- wave presence, the analyses 
will be focused on change fr om baseline (ie , treatment -emergent changes).

The analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be 
presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mean, SD , median, minimum, 
maximum geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation ) separately by group. 
Individual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time data will 
be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data may be provided as well.  
For each subject, the following PK parameters will b e calculated, whenever possible, based 
on the plasma concentration for CBP-307 and moxifloxacin, according to the model 
independent approach: 
• C
max 
• tmax 
• AUC 0-24  
• AUC inf 
• apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ Z) 
• t1/2  
• apparent total clearance (CL/F)  
• apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V z/F)  
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed, if appropriate, using commercial software such as Phoenix® WinNonlin
® (Version 8.1 or higher).  
Other parameter s may be added as appropriate. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as recorded on the eCRF. Other data handling 
procedures will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
8.5. Safety Analysis 
All AEs will be listed and treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized using the descriptive 
methodology. Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Observed values for clinical laboratory test data, 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, and physical 
examination findings will be listed.

Protocol Version 4.0, 2 6 October 2021 Page 50 of 67 Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , whether or not related to the study 
treatment . This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that had increased 
in severity or frequency since the administration of study medication.  
Examples of AEs include: 
•Symptoms described by the subject, or signs observed by the investigator, and
•Abnormal findings (involving clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, ECG,
etc.)
•Exacerbation of prev ious condition, including increased incidence and/or severity.
Note: Regarding decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood in this study, please report them as follows: 
•Since a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood is due to the mechanism of
action of the drug, it is not to be reported as an AE. However, clinical diagnosis
related to a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood indicates AE reporting (ifno diagnosis is available, it is required to report related clinical symptoms or signs).
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs. All AEs will 
be recorded in the medical records and eCRFs. The investigator (or designee) is to record in detail any AE that occurred to the subject, including: AE diagnosis whenever possible, or signs, symptoms, the start date and time of occurrence, the stop date and tim e of occurrence, 
seriousness (ie , whether it is a n SAE), severity of AEs, causality assessment, actions taken on 
the investigational product, other actions (eg, medications/treatments given), and outcomes of AEs.  
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the severi ty of the AE  using the 
following categories:  
•Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily
living.
•Moderate:  Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The
event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses nosignificant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 2 6 October 2021 Page 51 of 67 •Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly  affects clinical
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
Re
lationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study treatment using a 4- category system according to  the following guidelines: 
•Not Related : The AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study
procedure/conditions.
•Unlikely Related : The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that
the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE.
•Possibly Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of
drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or thestudy procedures/conditions.
•Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of
the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesizedcause-effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced.
Follow- up of Adverse Even ts 
Every reasonable effort will be made to follow up with subjects who have AEs. Any subject who has an ongoing AE that is  possibly related or related to the IMP or study procedures at 
the follow-up visit will be followed up, where possible, until resolution or until the unresolved AE is judged by the investigator (or designee) to have stabilized . This will be 
completed at the investigator ’s (or designee’s) discretion.  Any subject who has an ongoing 
AE that is not related or unlikely related to the IMP or s tudy procedures at the follow-up visit 
can be closed out as ongoing at the investigator ’s discretion.  
Adverse Drug Reactions  
All noxious and unintended responses to an IMP ( ie, where a causal relationship between an 
IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions.  
For marketed medicinal  products, a response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and 
which  occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases 
or modification of physiological function is to be considered an adverse drug reaction. 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, IB for an unapproved IMP).  
Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be collected after subjects sign the informed consent form and throughout the entire study, ie, until the end-of-study as specified in the protocol (or at  early termination).  
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 2 6 October 2021 Page 52 of 67 An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose either:  
•results in death
•is life -threatening
•requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospital ization
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
•results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect
•results in an important medical event (see below) .
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Instances of death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the investigator  at 
any time after cessation of the study treatment and considered by the investigator  to be 
possibly related to the study treatment, will be reported to the sponsor (or designee) . 
Definition of Life-threatening 
An AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred (ie, does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a 
more serious form). For instance, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal.  
Defini tion of Hospitalization  
Adverse events requiring hospitalization should be considered serious. In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that  would not have 
been appropriate at the study site . When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or 
was necessary, the AE should be considered as serious. 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures, which are not the result of 
an AE, need not be considered AEs and should be recorded on a clinical assessment form and added to the e CRF . If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, this must be 
reported as an AE and either ‘serious’ or ‘nonserious’ attributed according to the usual criteria.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator will complete an SAE report form and forward it by facsimile  or email  to 
Labcorp  Drug Safety  and the sponsor immediately (within 24  hours) upon becoming aware of 
an SAE.

Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 2 6 October 2021 Page 53 of 67 All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) to:

The responsibilities of Labcorp  Drug Safety  include the following: 
•Prepare an AE reporting plan prior to the start of the study. Where this plan differs
from the applicable study site  standard operating procedure on SAE reporting, the
safety management p lan will always take precedence.
•Receive and review SAE report forms from the study site  and inform the sponsor of
the SAE within 1 working day of the initial notification to Labcorp  Drug Safety  who
will delete any information from the SAE report forms that may identify the subject.
•Write case narratives and enter the case into Labcorp ’s safety database as defined in
the AE reporting plan.
•Produce appropriate reports of all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions and
forward them to the IRB/ EC, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency,
FDA, principal investigator, and the sponsor within the timeframes stipulated in the
Clinical Trials Directive Guideline (EN TR/CT  3).
The responsibility for reporting SAEs will be transferred to the sponsor 28 days after the end 
of the study. 
For SAEs, the active reporting period to sponsor or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent through to the last subject  visit.  
Nonserious AEs should be collected from the time the subject  has taken the placebo dose on 
Day -1 through the last subject  visit. If AEs that occur in the screening prior to the placebo 
administration to all subjects on Day -1 are considered to be related to the study procedure, 
they should be also collected.  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, the 
sponsor should be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event. This time 
frame also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE 
reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his or her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the sponsor in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting as specified above. In addition, an investigator 
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 2 6 October 2021 Page 54 of 67 may be requested by the sponsor to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an 
expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the AE eCRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. I nformation on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the sponsor or its designated representative.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy (maternal or paternal exposure to study treatment ) does not meet the definition of 
an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. 
If the female subject becomes pregnant during the clinical trial and has not yet been dosed 
with study treatment, she must be withdrawn from the study. If the female subject becomes pregnant during the clinical trial and has been dosed, she must discontinue treatment immediately  but may remain on study for safety evaluations . If the partner of a male subject 
becomes pregnant during the clinical trial, the subject can continue the clinical trial.  
For pregnancy of female subjects or partners of the male subjects during this study, investigators should report to the sponsor or designee in a pregnancy report form within 24 hours after investigator awareness and report to the IRB/ EC in time as per local 
requirement.   
The investigator will follow up on pregnancy outcomes, until not less than 12 months after birth, unless otherwise justified , and will report the outcome to the sponsor and IRB/EC.  
If any adverse pregnancy outcome (eg, the outcome of the pregnancy is stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, or fetal malformations ), it should be considered as an SAE and be 
reported in accordance with SAE reporting requirements.

Definitions  
Women of Childbearing Potential: premenopausal females who are anatomically and 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant following menarche.  
Women of Non childbearing  Potential: 
1.Surgically sterile:  females who are permanently sterile via hysterectomy,
bilateral salpingectomy , and/or bilateral oophorectomy by reported medical
history and/or medical records. Surgical sterilization to have occurred a minimumof 6 weeks, or at the investigator ’s discretion, prior to screening .
2. Postmenopausal: f emales at least 45 years of age with amenorrhea for 12 months
without an alternative medical reason with confirmatory follicle -stimulating
hormone (FSH) levels of ≥40 mIU/mL. The amenorrhea should not be induced bya medical condition such as anorexia nervosa, hypothyroid disease or polycysticovarian disease, or by extreme exercise. It should not be due to concomitantmedications that may have induced the amenorrhea such as oral contraceptives,hormones, gonadotropin-releasing hormones, anti-estrogens, or selective estrogenreceptor modulators. Females on hormone replacement therapy with FSH levels<40 mIU/mL may be included at the discretion of the investigator.
Fertile male: a male that is considered fertile after puberty.  
Infertile male: permanently sterile male via bilateral orchiectomy.  
Contraception Guidance  
Female Subjects  
Female subjects who are of nonchildbearing potential will not be required to use contraception. Female subjects of childbearing  potential must be willing to use 2 methods 
(1 primary and 1 secondary method) of birth control from the time of signing the ICF until 
90 days after the follow-up visit. Primary (non-barrier) methods of contraception include: 
•surgical method performed at least 3 months prior to the screening  visit:
obilateral tubal ligation  or bilateral salpingectomy
oEssure
® (hysteroscopic bilateral tubal occlusion) with confirmation of
occlusion of the fallopian tubes
•non-hormonal intrauterine device or Mirena® (other hormonal intrauterine devices
will not be allowed) in place for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of the studydrug
•vasectomized male partner (sterilization performed at least 90 days prior to thescreening  visit, with verb al confirmation of surgical success, and the sole partner for
the female subject)
Protocol Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 4.0, 2 6 October 2021 Page 58 of 67 Secondary (barrier) methods of contraception include: 
•male condom with out spermicide
•female condom with out spermicide
•cervical cap with out spermicide (as prescribed )
•diaphra gm with out spermicide (as prescribed ).
Female subjects of childbearing potential should refrain from donation of ova from check -in 
(Day -2 ) until 90 days after the follow-up visit. 
Male Subjects  
Male subjects  (even with  a history of vasectomy) with partners of childbearing potential must 
use a male barrier method of contraception (ie, male condom without spermicide) in addition 
to a second method of acceptable contraception from check -in until 90 days after the 
follow-up visit. Acceptable methods of contraception for female partners include:  
•hormonal injection
•combined oral contraceptive pill or progestin/progestogen-only pill
•combined hormonal patch
•combined hormonal vaginal ring
•surgical method (bilateral tubal ligation  or Essure® [hysteroscopic bilateral tubal
occlusion])
•hormonal implant
•hormonal or non-hormonal intrauterine device
•cervical cap with out spermicide
•diaphragm with out spermicide .
An acceptable second method of contraception for male subjects is vasectomy that has been performed at least 90 days prior to the screening visit with verbal confirmation of surgical success.  
For male subjects  (even with a history of vasectomy), sexual intercourse with female partners 
who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be avoided unless condoms are used from the time of the first dose until 90 days after the follow-up visit. Male subjects are required to refrain from donation of sperm from check -in until 90 days after the follow-up visit. 
Sexual Abstinence and Same -sex Relati onships  
Subjects who practice true abstinence, because of the subject’s lifestyle choice (ie, the subject should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation), are exempt from contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence (eg, calenda r, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a

agree to use contraception as described previousl y.  
For subjects who are exclusively in same-sex relationships, contraceptive requirements do not apply. If a subject who is in a same- sex relationship at the time of signing the ICF becomes 
engaged in a heterosexual relationship, they must agree to use contraception as described previously.

Day 19. Postdos e safety will be interpreted on -site by the investigator and may be repeated to  confirm/refute clinically abnormal findings.
5.Continuous cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Day -1 (baseline), 1, 6 , 15, and 16. The recording will be started at least 1 hour before
dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day -1 . Replicate 12-lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1,
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdos e on each day. At timepoints for ECG extractions, subjects will be supinely resting in a n undisturbed environment. The ECG effects
of CBP -307 will be tested on data from Day -1 (baseline for both groups), Day  6 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo), and Day 15 (supratherapeutic
concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxi floxacin will be tested on data from Days -1, 1, 15, and 16.
6.Serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening  and urine pregnancy test s will be performed  on Day -2 and at the follow -up visit (Day 29±2 days) . A positive urine
pregnancy test will be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.
7.Pharmacokinetic samplings will be performed prior to dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK s ampling day (Days 1, 6, 15, and 16).
Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15.
8.Allowable assessment/sample collection windows are  as follows: ±2  minutes for 0.5 hours postdose, ±5 minutes for 1 hour postdose, ±15 minutes for ECGs and vital
sign measurements at 2 hours postdose and ±5 minutes for PK sampling at 2 hours postdose, ±5 minutes for 3 to 4  hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose,
and ±30 minutes for 12 to 24, 72, and 96  hours postdose.
9.Subjects will be monitored via cardiac telemetry during the treatment period from approximately 1  hour prior to dose administration and until  approximately 12 hours
postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7 (up-titration days) . Based on the emerging safety data from the study, the duration of the telemetry may be extended if necessary. The
start and stop date and time of the telemetry monitoring will be recorded in the eCRF.

Labcorp Drug Development Study : 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August 2021  Page 2 of 9 The primary changes in this amendment, along with the rationale for the/each change as 
appropriate, are:  
1. Based on recommendations from the regulatory agency, the protocol was modified to add one oral dose administration of placebo -matched CBP -307 capsule on Day 16 for all 
subjects. This will allow  for the placebo comparisons in the assay sensitivity analysis for 
Days  1 and 16. 
2. To update the protocol to exclude male and female subjects with baseline QT interval 
corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) >450 msec.  
3. To update the protocol to modify the allowable window for any history or evidence of alcoholism or drug/chemica l abuse to within 12 months prior to check- in rather than 
2 years.  
4. To m odify the windows for safety assessments at 2  hours postdose in order to provide 
additional time for the electrocardiogram (ECG) and  vital signs measurements due to the 
required assessm ents at this time point . 
5. To remove the specified order for the safety assessments to allow flexibility  when the 
assessments coincide with the ECG extractions.  
Minor changes:  
1. To update the company name from “Covance” to “Labcorp” as Covance is re-branding 
into the parent company Labcorp (applicable only for business units transitioned on or 
after 25 Jun 2021).  
2. To modify the protocol to include an administrative change in  Medical Monitor from 
Jane Royalty to Sun u Valasseri . 
3. The protocol version and date were updated throughout the protocol. 
4. Typographical errors and formatting errors were corrected, as necessary.

position for at least 10  minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction 
timepoint, which will end immediately prior to the PK sampling. When timepoints for ECG extraction, safety ECGs, vital sign measurements, and blood draws coincide, procedures will be performed in said order. At each timepoint, up to 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5-minute time window (the last 5 minutes of the 15 -minute period when the subject is 
maintained in a supine, quiet position). The ECG effects of CBP -307 will be tested on data from 
Day -1 (baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo), and Day 15 (supratherapeutic concentrations  versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be 
evaluated using ECG data collected on Days -1, 1, 15, and 16.

Study Title  
A Phase I, Single -center, Randomized, Double -blind, Double -dummy, Placebo - and 
Positive -Controlled Study to Investigate the Effects of CBP -307 on the QT C Interval in 
Healthy Subjects  
Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic CBP -307 plasma 
concentrations on the heart -rate corrected QT interval (QTc) in healthy subjects.  
The secondary objective s of the study are:  
• To demonstrate assay sensitivity of the study to detect a small QT effect using 
moxifloxacin as a positive control.  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple 
oral doses of CBP -307 in healthy subjects.  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of CBP -307 following administration of 
therapeutic and supr atherapeutic multiple oral doses in healthy subjects.  
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses of 
CBP -307 on heart rate (HR), PR and QRS intervals, and T -wave morphology. 
Study Design 
This will be a Phase I, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, placebo -controlled, 
positive -controlled, single -site, 3 -arm study to investigate the effects of therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic oral doses of CBP -307 on the QTc interval in healthy male and female 
subjects.  
Potential subject s will be asked to read and sign an i nformed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eligibility to 
enter the study will be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After informed consent has 
been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported. After placebo  administration to all subjects on 
Day - 1, all adverse events (AEs), whether volunteer ed, elicited, or noted upon physical 
examination, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from Day - 1 until the end of the 
study).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 2 groups ( Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 
2 sub- groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects. 
Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the morning on

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 7 of 66  Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and on Day 16 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on 
Day - 1).  
The following treatments will be administered:  
• Starting dose s of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  followed by an up- titrated 
dose of 0.1 mg on Day 2)  
• A therapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.2 mg, Days  3 to 6)  
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Days  7 to 15)  
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and CBP -307) 
• Moxifloxacin (400 mg)  
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study with an expected peak QT effect (placebo -corrected change- from -baseline  QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec.  
Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be  admitted into the study site on Day - 2 
and will remain at the study site until discharge on Day  19. Treatment administration will 
occur on Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and 16 under fasting conditions  (all subjects will receive 
placebo on Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic electrocardiogram (ECG ) monitoring and 
recording will begin at least 25  hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day  1 
and continue through 24  hours after the administ ration of study treatments on Day s 1, 6, 15, 
and 16 and at corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day - 1. Blood samples 
for PK analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint . Additional  PK samples will be collected  at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on 
Day 15. Subjects will return to the  study site for a follow -up visit on Day 29±2  days.  
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on Day 1). Continuous 
cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Day s -1, 1, 6, 1 5, and 
16. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock ti me on 
Day - 1. Replicate 12- lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to 
dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples  will be collected at the following timepoints : prior to dosing 
and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day (Days 1, 6, 
15, and 16; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5  hour s postdose, 
±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes 
for 12 to 24 hours postdose ). Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours 
following dosing on Day 15 (sample collection window: ±30 minutes ). Subjects will be 
inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which will end immediately prior to the PK 
sampling. At each timepoint, up to 10 ECG replicates will be ext racted from a 5 -minute time 
window (the last 5 minutes of the 15 -minute period when the subject is maintained in a

(baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic concent rations versus placebo), and Day 15 
(supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be 
evaluated using ECG data collected on Days - 1, 1, 15, and 16. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in the analyses will 
be selected from predetermined timepoints specif ied above and will be read by the central 
ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, safety 12- lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at screening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow -up visit. In addition, subjects will be monitored via 
cardiac telemetry at specific timepoints during the treatment period.  
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening through follow -up 
visit) is a nticipated to be approximately 59 days.  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first subject signs an ICF. The point of 
enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled).  
Number of Subjects  
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 
2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion  
Healthy male and female  subjects aged between 18 and 60 years (inclusive) with a body mass 
index between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m
2 (inclusive).  
Investigatio nal Medicinal P roducts, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
The following treatments will be administered:  
• Starting dose s of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  titrated to 0.1 mg on 
Day 2; oral capsule ) 
• A therapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.2 mg, Days  3 to 6;  oral capsule ) 
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Days  7 to 15; oral capsule )

Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 9 of 66  Duration of Subject Participation in the Study  
Duration of subject participation from the screening visit through follow -up visit  will be up to 
approximately 26 days for screening period (Days - 28 to - 3), 21 days for the in- house  
treatment period (Days -2 to 19) , and 10 ± 2 days for follow -up (Day 29± 2 days) , in total 
approximately 59 days.  
Endpoints  
Electrocardiogram (Cardiodynamic):  
The primary cardiodynamic endpoint is the change -from- baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF).  
The secondary cardiodynamic  endpoints are:  
• Change -from- baseline HR, PR, QRS ( ∆HR, ∆ PR, and ∆ QRS);  
• Placebo -corrected change- from- baseline HR, QTcF, PR, and QRS ( ∆∆HR, ∆∆QTcF, 
∆∆PR, and ∆∆QRS);  
• Categorical outliers for QTcF, HR, PR, and QRS;  
• Frequency of treatment -emergent changes of T - wave morphology and U -wave 
presence.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of plasma concentrations of CBP -307. The 
PK parameters of CBP -307 will be calculated using a model independent approach. The 
following PK parameter endpoints will be calculated: maximum observed conc entration 
(Cmax), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero  extrapolated  to infinity 
(AUC inf), area under the concentration- time curve from time zero to 24 hours postdose 
(AUC 0-24), and time of the maximum observed concentration ( tmax). Other noncompartmental 
parameters may be reported.  
Safety:  
Adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), 
12lead ECGs , and vital signs measurements.  
Statistical Methods  
Cardiodynamic evaluation:  
The primary analysis will be based on concentration -QTc modeling of the relationship 
between plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and change -from -baseline QTcF (∆QTcF) with 
the intent to exclude an effect of placebo -corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) >  10 msec at clinically 
relevant plasma levels. Placebo -corrected ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS , and ∆ QTcF (ΔΔHR, ΔΔPR, 
ΔΔQRS , and ∆∆QTcF) will also be evaluated at each postdosing timepoint ('by- timepoint' 
Protocol Amendment 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 10 of 66  analysis).  An analysis of categorical outliers will be performed for changes in HR, PR, QRS, 
QTcF, T- wave morphology, and U -wave presence. Assay sensitivity will be evaluated by 
concentration -QTc analysis of the effect on ∆ΔQTcF of moxifloxacin using a similar model  
as for the primary analysis.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
The analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be 
presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, maximum geometric  mean, and geometric coefficient of variation) separately by 
cohor t. Individual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time 
data will be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data may be 
provided as well.  
Pharmaco kinet ic/electrocardiography analyses:  
The relationship between CBP -307 plasma concentrations  and the change from ∆ QTcF will 
be evaluated using a linear mixed- effects modeling approach.  
Safety:  
All AEs  will be listed and treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized using the descriptive 
methodology. Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Observed values for clinical laboratory test data, 12lead ECGs, vital signs, and physical 
examination findings will be listed.

1.1. Disease Background  
Autoimmune diseases are serious disorders that afflict a large portion of the world 
population;  most have no cures. Significant advances have been made in the development of 
novel and disease -modifying therapies, but many of these new tre atments have significant 
side effects. Treatments are needed that provide better risk -to-benefit profiles than the 
existing therapeutic choices.  
T cells are important immune cells that mediate the development of autoimmune disorders. Migration of T cells from lymphoid tissues to the sites of inflammation is central to the functions of T cells, and this process is dependent on sphingosine -1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 
1 (S1P1)  which  is known to ameliorate a variety of autoimmune diseases in animals and 
humans. Down modulation of this receptor, using S1P1 agonists, prevents T cell egress and results in a reduced number of circulating lymphocytes, particularly the CD4+ - and CD8+ -
naïve and central -memory T cell subsets.  
1.2. Overview of CBP -307 
CBP -307 is a n S1P1  agonist that is being developed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases 
by Suzhou C onnect Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. CBP -307 (1 -(2-fluoro -4-(5-(4-isobutylphenyl) -
1,2,4- oxadiazol -3-yl) benzyl)  azetidine -3-carboxylic acid hemihydrate) is a potent, selective, 
small-molecule agonist of S1P1 and S1P5 receptor s. Cell -based assays have confirmed 
CBP -307 induces internalization of S1P1 from the cell surface. This is consistent with the 
known mechanism of action of other S1P1 agonists, in that they down- modulate S1P1 and 
inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues.  
1.2.1. Summary of Clinical Experience  
The Phase 1 development of CBP -307 comprised 2 completed studies in healthy subjects:  
• A single and multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
CBP -307 including pharmacokinetic ( PK), pharmacodynamic ( PD), and food- effect 
assessments (Study CBP -307AU001)  
• A single -dose and multiple -dose, and fixed- dose titration study to evaluate the safety 
and tolerabilit y of CBP -307 including PK and PD  (Study CBP -307CN001)  
Currently, CBP -307 is being evaluated in 2 Phase 2 studies :  
• Ongoing multicenter study in subjec ts with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis 
(Study CBP -307CN002) to compare the clinical efficacy by evaluating the clinical 
response to CBP -307 versus placebo and the  clinical remission and mucosal healing

tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo.  
• Ongoing study in subjec ts with moderate to severe  Crohn’s disease compare s clinical 
efficacy by evaluating the clinical response to CBP -307 versus placebo and the 
clinical remission and mucosal healing achieved by CBP -307 versus placebo  and to 
compare the clinical safety and tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo. 
1.2.1.1.  Safety  
Study CBP -307AU001  
A total of 44 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. There were 28 subjects evaluated 
using the single -dose regimen  (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 2.5 mg CBP -307) of which 21 subjects 
received CBP -307 and 7 subjects receive d placebo. Another 16 healthy subjects were 
evaluated using the multiple -dose regimen ( 0.15 and 0.25 mg CBP -307 given once daily 
[QD] for 28 consecutive days ) of which 12 subjects received  CBP -307 and 4 subjects 
received placebo. 
Overall,  no unexpected safety signals were identified  and no deaths occurred in this study. 
For the single -dose regiment, no subject s were discontinued due to a treatment- emergent AE 
(TEAE). In the multiple -dose re gimen, there were 2 subjects who were discontinued from the 
study (due to increased alanine transaminase and second degree AV block [not considered to 
be clinically significant, as judged by the investig ator]). A ll TEAEs resolved by the end of 
the study.  
In the single -dose regimen groups, TEAEs  were reported in 12 of 21 subjects  (57.1%) treated 
with CBP -307 and in 3 of 7 subjects  (42.8%)  treated with placebo. Most (91.7%) of the 
TEAEs in these subjects were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in the CBP -307-treated groups were headache (28.6%); dizziness (19.0%); and bradycardia (9.5%). 
Bradycardia was reported only in 2 subjects receiving the highest (2.5 mg) CBP -307 dose . 
One subject had a serious adverse event (SAE) of bradycardia (associated with transient 
asystole) following a single  dose of 2.5 mg CBP -307. 
In the multiple -dose regimen groups, CBP -307 at doses of 0.15 and 0.25 mg QD was 
generally well tolerated over the 28 days of dosing. Treatment -emergent AEs were reported 
in 11 of 12 subjects (91.7%) in the CBP -307 groups and 2 of 4 subjects (50.0%) in the 
placebo groups. Most (83.3% ) TEAEs were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in 
the 2 CBP -307 groups were headache (50.0%), and fatigue, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain 
(16.7%  each). The incidences of these TEAEs were similar in both CBP -307-treated groups. 
No SAEs were reported for subjects in the multiple -dose regimen.  
Study CBP -307CN001  
A total of 30 eligible subjects completed 3 CBP -307 dose groups in ascending order of dos e 
after randomization (in a ratio of 1:1:1): Group A (0.1 mg), Group B (0.2 mg), and Group C (0.3 mg). Each dose group consisted of 10 subjects, including 8 subjects receiving the investigational drug and 2 subjects receiving placebo by random assignment. The administration started from the dose of 0.1 mg. The subjects in this group received a single

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 19 of 66  dose of CBP -307 or placebo and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 
7 days. Then the subjects received 0.1 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 14 consecutive days 
and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days. Dose escalation did not 
occur until the review of the single -dose regimen safety data from the 6  subjects in the 
previous dose cohort, and the safety data did not meet the termination criteria.  The subjects in 
the dose of 0.3 mg received fi xed-dose titration regimen, ie,  0.05 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD 
for 3  consecutive days ; 0.1 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days ; 0.2 mg 
CBP -307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days;  finally,  0.3 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 
14 consecutive days, and the subjects were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days.  
Overall, no unexpected safety signals were identified, and there were no deaths,  SAEs, or 
AEs leading to the subject’s early withdrawal from the study after administration of 
CBP -307. In the safety set, a total of 29 subjects ( 8 in Group A, 100%; 8 in Group B, 100%; 
8 in Group C, 100% and 5 in placebo group, 83.3%) experienced TEAEs. 
During the single -dose period, a total of 14 subjects (5 of 8 in Group A, 62.5%; 6 of 8 in 
Group B, 75%, and 3 of 4 in placebo group, 75%) developed AEs. T he incidence of TEAEs 
in Group A was generally similar to the placebo group. Among TEAEs in Group B, the 
inciden ce of AEs related to abnormalities in investigations was higher than that in placebo 
group, including lymphocyte count decreased (12.5%), white blood cell ( WBC)  count 
decreased (12.5% ), neutrophil count decreased ( 12.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased  
(25%), and gamma -glutamyltransferase increased (12.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased (12.5%). Additionally, 1 subject experienced heart rate (HR) decreased (12.5%).  
During dose -titration period, 2 subjects (2 of 8 in Group C, 25%) experienced TEAEs. The 
TEAEs reported in Group C during the titration period included cough (12.5%) and increased upper airway secretion (12.5%). There were no TEAEs in the placebo group during this period.  
During repeated- dose period, a total of 28 subjects (8 of 8 i n Group A, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group 
B, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group C, 100%; and 4 of 6 in placebo group, 66.7%) experienced AEs. The most frequent TEAE in Group A was uppe r respiratory tract infection ( 37.5%) compared 
with placebo group; the most frequent TEAEs in Group B and Group C included decreased lymphocyte count (Group B, 87.5%; Group C, 100.0%), WBC  count ( Group B, 87.5%; 
Group C, 62.5%), and neutrophil count ( Group B, 50%; Group C, 12.5%). The TEAEs noted 
in Group B during the repeated -dose period also incl uded increased alanine aminotransferase 
(25%), gamma -glutamyltransferase (37.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase (12.5%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (12.5%), influenza (12.5%), chest pain (12.5%), lethargy (25%), and neck pain (12.5%); TEAEs in Group C during the repeated- dose period also included 
increased alanine aminotransferase (25%), decreased HR (12.5%), and mouth ulcer (12.5%); the TEAEs in placebo group included increased transaminase (16.7%), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (1/6, 16.7%), decreased hemoglobin (16.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (16.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), dizziness (16.7%), and palpitations (16.7%).

1.2.1.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
CBP -307 given orally as a single dose  was readily absorbed; drug concentrations peaked at 
approximately 6 hours after administration, with an elimination apparent terminal elimination 
half-life (t1/2) of approximately 25 hours (range of 23 to 29 hours). The time to maximum 
observed concentration (Cmax) in the blood was delayed from 6 hours to approximately 
10 hours when CBP -307 was given with a high -fat diet. Food consumption also increased 
exposure  (Table  1). 
For the single -dose ad ministration, CBP -307 exposure  (based on C max and area under the 
concentration -time curve  [AUCs ]) increased with increasing dose following a single -dose 
administration  (Table  1).

1.3. Overview of Moxifloxacin  
Moxifloxacin is a broad -spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that binds to and inhibits the 
hERG IKr α subunit and causes a mean increase of the QTc  interval of 6 ms after a single 
400-mg oral dose. Moxifloxacin is commonly used as a positive control in thorough QT 
(TQT) studies to satisfy the requirements of International Council for/Conference on 
Harmonisation  (ICH)  E14. 
Refer to the regional manufa cturer package insert of AVELOX (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) 
tablets for additional information.2 
1.4. Study Rationale  
Regulatory guidance (ICH E14) has emphasized the need to obtain clear robust data on the 
effect of new chemical entities on electrocardiogram ( ECG)  parameters with focus on cardiac 
repolarization as measured by  the QTc duration. Though many Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials may be 
conducted they usually have an insufficient sample size, infrequent sampling of ECG data, or 
the use of inadequate controls to overcome the high rate of spontaneous change in QTc duration. This has resulted in regulatory guidance recommending a dedicated or thorough trial to define the ECG effects of new drugs.  
This study will be done in healthy subjects to eliminate variables known to have an effect on ECG parameters (concomitant drugs, diseases, etc.). A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 i s 
required to mimic the exposure in healthy subjects that may occur in the target population under the worst of circumstances (eg, concomitant use of cytochrome P450  [CYP ]3A4

dose prescribed) and to allow for PK to QTc modeling to assess the effect of drug 
concentration on cardiac repolarization. 
1.5. Benefit -risk Assessment  
Healthy subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an 
assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study . The risks of participation 
are primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there 
may also be some discomfort from the collection of blood samples and other study 
procedures. More information about the known and expected benefits, risks , and reasonably 
anticipated AEs associated with CBP -307 may be found in the I B.1  
2. OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This will be a Phase I, randomiz ed, double -blind, double -dummy, placebo -controlled, 
positive-controlled, single -site, 3- arm study to investigate  the effect s of therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic oral doses of CBP -307 on the QTc interval in he althy male and female 
subjects.  
Potential subjects will be asked to read and sign an i nformed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eligibility to 
enter the study will be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After in formed consent has 
been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only SAEs  will be 
reported. After placebo  administration to all subjects on Day -1, all AEs, whether

study (ie , from Day - 1 until the end of the study).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects ( at least  30% for each sex ) will be 
randomized into 2 groups  (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 
2 sub- groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects . 
Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the mornin g on 
Days 1, 2, 3 t o 6, 7 to 15, and on Day 16 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on 
Day - 1).  
The follow ing treatments will be administered:  
• Starting dose s of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  followed by an up- titrated 
dose of  0.1 mg on Day  2) 
• A therapeuti c dose of CBP -307 (0.2 mg, Day s 3 to 6)  
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Day s 7 to 15)  
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and  CBP -307) 
• Moxifloxacin ( 400 mg)   
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study 
with an expected peak QT effect (placebo -corrected change- from -baseline QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec.  
An overview of the study design is shown in Figure  1.

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 25 of 66  Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day  -2 
and will remain at  the study site until discharge on Day  19. T reatment administration will 
occur on Days  1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and 16 under fasting conditions  (all subjects will receive 
placebo on Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic ECG monitoring and recording will begin at 
least 25 hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day 1 and continue through 
24 hours after the administration of study treatments  on Days  1, 6, 15, and 16 and at 
corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day - 1. Blood samples for PK 
analysis will be coll ected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint.  
Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15. 
Subjects will return to the study site for a follow -up visit on Day 29±2  days. 
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 
25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on Day 1). Continuous 
cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Day s -1, 1, 6, 1 5, and 
16. T he recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock time on 
Day - 1. Replicate 12- lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to 
dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on ea ch day. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected at the following timepoints: prior to dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day ( Days  1, 6, 
15, and 16; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5 hour s postdose, 
±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes 
for 12 to 24 hours postdose ). Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours 
following dosing on Day 15 (sample collection window: ±30 minutes ). Subjects will be 
inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each 
cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which will end immediately prior to the PK 
sampling. At each time point, up to 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time 
window (the last 5 minutes of the 15 -minute period when the subject is maintained in a 
supine, quiet position). The ECG effects of CBP -307 will be tested on data from Day -1 
(baseline fo r both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo) , and Day 15 
(supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be 
evaluat ed using ECG data collected on Days - 1, 1, 15, and 16. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to 
treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in th e analyses will 
be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central 
ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, safety 1 2-lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at screening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow -up visit. In addition, subjects will be monitored via 
cardiac telemetry at specific timepoints during the treatment period.  
The total duration of study participatio n for each subject (from screening  through follow -up 
visit) is anticipated to be approximately 59 days .

the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled).  
A Schedule of Assessments is presented in  Appendix 6. 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for CBP -307 to cause QT prolongation. 
As CBP -307 exposure affects heart rate, the primary endpoint for this study will be the QTcF.  
The study will  be randomized and double -blind because randomization eliminates 
confounding by baseline va riables and blinding eliminates confounding by co- interventions, 
thus eliminating the possibility that the observed effects of the intervention are because of 
differential use of othe r treatments.  
The sample size for this study is based on a formal statistical power calculation . 
Conducting the study in healthy subjects mitigates the potential confounding effects of the 
disease state and concomitant medications.  Both male and female subjects will be included to 
eliminate similar known ECG variability effects.  
Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP -307, subjects will be 
fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fast ed for 4 hours postdose  on 
the days when PK samples are collected . 
Pharmacokinetic assessments of CBP -307 concentrations in plasma will be evaluated during 
the study. The timepoints for the PK sample collections are based on previous studies and are considered adequate to allow for the characterization of the drug’s PK after oral dosing. 
Furthermore, the chosen PK sample collection for CBP -307 is anticipated to be sufficient to 
allow reasonable estimation of t
1/2 during the terminal elimination phase.  
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
According to ICH E14, the highest therapeutic dose and a supratherapeutic dose are 
recommended for the QT/QTc study. The CBP -307 doses of 0.2 and 0.5 mg were chosen for 
evaluation in this study based on observed PK results in co mpleted Phase 1 studies. To 
carefully monitor safety following the administration of CBP -307 doses in  Group 1, CBP -307 
doses will be up -titrated as follows: subjects will rece ive a s tarting dose of 0.05 mg CBP -307 
on Day 1 followed by an up- titrated dose of  0.1 mg on Day 2 and a dose of 0.2 mg on 
Days  3 to 6. Prior clinical experience with CBP -307 has not demonst rated clinically 
significant abnormalities in laboratory test results in the majority of subjects or a dose -
response r elationship for safety based on AEs . 
A single dose of 0.5 mg is the planned supratherapeutic dose, which balances the 
characteristics of the st udy design with the safety of healthy subject s. Testing of CBP -307 at 
substantial  multiples of the anticipated maximum therapeutic exposure is not clinically 
warranted due to the known safety and tolerability profile of CBP -307.

subjects ( Section  4.4) will be assigned a subject number corresponding to the number of the 
subject he/she is replacing plus 1000 (eg, Subject  1101 replaces Subject  0101). 
Subjects will be identified by screening  identification number or subject number only on all 
study documentation. A list identifying the subjects by subject number will be kept in the s ite 
master f ile. 
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
A subject is free to withdraw their informed consent from the study at any time  or they may 
be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or the sponsor for safety, 
behavioral, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol -required visits or 
procedures . In addition, a subject will be withdrawn  from dosing if any of the following 
criteria are met:  
• change in compliance with any inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant 
and affects subject safety  as determined by the investigator (or designee ) 
• noncompliance with the study restrictions that might affect subject safety or study 
assessments/objectives, as considered applicable by the investigator  (or designee)  
• any clinically relevant sign or symptom that , in the opinion of the investigator  (or 
designee) , warrants subject withdrawal . 
If a subject is withdrawn from dosing , the sponsor  will be notified and the date and reason(s) 
for the withdrawal will be documented in the subject ’s electronic c ase report f orm ( eCRF). If 
a subject is withdrawn  from the study , efforts will be made to perform all follow -up 
assessments, if possible ( Appendix 6).  Other procedures may be performed at  the 
investigator ’s (or designee’s)  and/or sponsor ’s discretion. If the subject is in -house, these 
procedures  should be performed before the subject is discharged from the clinic. The 
investigator  (or designee) may also request that the su bject return for an additional follow -up 
visit. All withdrawn subjects will be followed until resolution of all their AEs or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator  (or designee) to have stabilized.  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.

All supplies of the IMP, both bulk and subject -specific, will be stored in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s or pharmacy’s instructions. Until dispensed to the subjects, the study 
treatments will be stored at the study site in a location that is locked with restricted access.  
5.2. Study Treatment Administration  
Each dose of study treatment ( CBP -307, placebo, or moxifloxacin)  will be administered 
orally following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, with approximately 240 mL of room 
temperature water. Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP -307, 
subjects will be fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 
4 hours postdose  on the days when PK samples are collected . 
Subjects will be dosed in numerical order while sitting or standing but not be permitted to lie supine for 2 hours after treatment administration , except as necessitated by the occurrence of 
an AE(s) and/or study procedures.  
5.3. Randomization  
This is a double -blind  randomized study. Subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment 
sequences  before  administration of the first dose of study treatment. A randomization list will 
be generated by a statistician using a computer -generated pseudo- random permutation  
procedure . The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and 
on the enrollment eCRF. A computer -generated randomization schedule and emergency 
code -break envelopes will be provided to the study site. Randomization details will be 
included in the randomization specification.

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 34 of 66  5.4. Blinding  
This is a double -blinded study. The following controls will be employed to maintain the 
double -blind status of the study:  
• The placebo will be identical in appearance to CBP -307 or moxif loxacin. 
• The investigator and other members of staff involved with the study will remain 
blinded to the treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure. 
• Interim bioanalytical data will be provided to Labcorp  Early Clinical Biometrics  in a 
blinded manner.  
To maintain the blind, the investigator will be provided with a sealed randomization code for 
each subject, containing coded details of the treatment. These individual ly sealed envelopes 
will be kept in a limited access area that is accessible 24 hours a day. If, in order to manage subject safety or to support dose escalation dec isions (in the event of possibly 
treatment- related SAEs or severe AEs), the decision to unblind resides solely with the 
investigator. Whenever possible, and providing it does not interfere with or delay any 
decision in the best interest of the subject, the investigator will discuss the intended code -break with the sponsor. If it becomes necessary to break the code during the study, the 
date, time, and reason will be recorded in the subject's source data and on the individual envelope and will be witnessed by a second person. 
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance:  
• All doses will be administered under the supervision of suit ably qualified study site 
staff. 
• Immediately after dose administration, visual inspection of the mouth and hands will 
be performed for each subject.  
• At each dosing occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of IMP will be performed.    
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The investigator  (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of study 
treatments (CBP -307, moxifloxacin, placebo -matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched 
moxifloxacin)  received. In addition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, 
specifying the amount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensing. This drug 
accountability record will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the 
study, the original drug accountability record will be availabl e for review by the sponsor  
upon request. 
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarded upon 
satisfactory completion of the compliance and accountability procedures. Any unused 
assembled unit doses will be retained unt il the completion of the study.

placebo -matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched moxifloxacin) will be disposed of by the 
study site ’s pharmacy ( RAH Pharmacy) , per the sponsor ’s written instructions.  If destruction 
is authorized to take place at the study site ’s pharmacy, the investigator must ensure that the 
materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations and 
institutional policy. All study drug destructions must be adequately documented.  
6. CONCOMITANT THERAPIES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS  
6.1. Concomitant Therapies 
Subjects will refrain from the use of any prescription  or nonprescription medication s/products  
during the study until the follow -up visit, unless the investigator  (or designee)  and/or sponsor  
have given their prior consent. Medications taken within 28 days before study treatment 
administration will be documented as a prior treatment. Treatments taken after study 
treatment administration  will be documented as concomitant treatments.  
Paracetamol /acetaminophen  (2 g/day for up to 3 consecutive days) is an  acceptable 
concomitant medication. The administration of any other concomitant medications during the 
study is prohibited without prior ap proval of the investigator  (or designee) , unless its use is 
deemed necessary for the treatment of an AE . Any medication taken by a subject during the 
course of the study and the reason for its use will be documented in the source data.   
Females will refrain from the use of  hormone replacement therapy and oral, implantable, 
transdermal, injectable , or intrauterine  hormonal contraceptives (with the exception of 
Mirena®) during the study until the follow -up visit ( Appendix  4). 
6.2. Diet 
While confined at the study site, subjects will receive a standardized diet at scheduled times 
that do not conflict with other study- related activities. Subjects will be  fasted overnight (at 
least 10 hours ) before the collection of blood sample s for clinical laboratory evaluations . 
On the days with PK assessments ( Appendix 6), the subjects will be fasted  overnight ( at least  
10 hours ) prior to dosing and refrain from consuming wate r from 1 hour predose until  1 hour  
postdose, excluding the amount of water consumed at dosing. Food is allowed from 4 hours 
postdose. At all other times during the study, subjects may consume water ad libitum. 
Foods and beverages containing poppy seeds, grapefruit , or Seville oranges will not be 
allowed from 7  days prior to check -in until follow -up visit on Day 29±2 days . 
Consumption of c affeine /xanthine -containing foods and beverages will not be allowed from  
48 hours  before check -in until d ischarge on Day 19. 
Consumption of alcohol will not be permitted from 72 hours  prior to check -in until discharge 
on Day 19 and alcohol intake will be limited to a maximum of 2 units/day on all other days, 
whilst not at the study site, from screening to 72 hours prior to the follow -up visit  on 
Day 29±2 days .

Subjects will not be permitted to  use tobacco - or nicotine -containing products  within 
3 months prior to check -in until the follow -up visit.  
6.4. Exercise  
Subjects are required to refrain from strenuous exercise from  7 days  before check -in until the 
follow -up visit (Day 29 ±2 days ) and will otherwise maintain their normal level of physical 
activity during this time (ie, will not begin a new exercise program nor participate in any 
unusually strenuous physical exertion). 
6.5. Blood Donation  
Subjects are required to refrain from donation of  blood from 3 months prior to screening, 
plasma from 2 weeks prior to screening, and platelets from 6 weeks prior to screening until 
3 months after the follow -up visit.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures as closely as possible to the 
nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, and the other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. 
The highest priority procedures will be performed closes t to the nominal time. The order of 
priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority):  
• dosing  
• continuous ECG extraction window  
• pharmacokinetic blood samples 
• safety assessments  
• any other procedures . 
This study includes a screening period (Day - 28 to Day - 3), a treatment period (Days -2 to 
19), and a follow -up period (Day 29 ±2 days ).  
The defined abnormal vital sign measurements (Exclusion Criteria #4) at check- in (Day -2) 
or baseline (Day -1 predose) will only be considered exclusionary if judged applicable by the 
investigator. For confirmation of enrollment eligibility based on pulse rate , the pulse rate 
assessed by vital signs, rather than the 12 -lead ECG, will be used. For all subjects, the 
screening, check -in, or baseline blood pressure, pulse rate , and respiratory rate may be 
repeated after 5 to 10 minutes if the initial reading is  believed to be atypical for the subject.

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 37 of 66  7.1. General Assessments  
7.1.1. Demographics  
Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order 
to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.  
7.1.2. Medical History  
At the timepoint specified in Appendix 6, the investigator or designee will collect a complete 
medical and surgical history. Medical history will include information on the subject’s 
concurrent medical conditions and any events occurring prior to the first dose of study 
treatment. All findings will be recorded on the medical history eCRF.  
7.2. Electrocardiography Assessments  
7.2.1. Continuo us 12 -lead Electrocardiogram Recording  
Continuous 12- lead digital ECG recording will be performed as specified in Appendix 6. All 
ECG data will be col lected using a Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG continuous 12- lead 
digital recorder. The 12- lead Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG equipment will be supplied 
and supported by ERT (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA). The continuous 12-lead digital ECG data will be stored onto SD memory cards.  
The ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected by pred etermined timepoints as defined 
in Appendix  6 and will be read centrally by ERT  (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, 
PA). The following principles will be followed in ERT’s core laboratory:  
• ECG analysts are blinded to the subject, visit, and treatment allocation.  
• Baseline and on -treatment ECGs for a particular subjec t will be over- read on the same 
lead and will be analyzed by the same reader.  
The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analy zable, then the primary lead of  
analysis will be changed to another lead for the entire subject data set.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be extracted in up to 10 replicates at the predefined timepoints and 
subjects will be inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes 
after each nominal time.  
7.2.1.1.  TQT Plus Extraction Technique  
Ten 14- second digital 12 -lead ECG tracings will be extracted from the continuous Holter (or 
Mortara Surveyor)  recordings using the ‘TQT Plus method’, a computer -assisted and 
statistical process utilized by ERT . The method enables extraction of ECGs with the lowest 
HR variability and noise within the protocol -specified extraction time window (eg , the HR 
and QT changes from beat -to-beat in the range of <10%). At each protocol -specified 
timepoint, 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute “ECG window” (typically,

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 38 of 66  the last 5 minutes of the 15- minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine, quiet 
position ). 
7.2.1.2.  Expert  Precision QT Analysis  
Expert  precision QT analysis will b e performed on all analyzable (non- artifact) beats in the 
10 ECG replicates. Statistical quality control procedures  are used to review and assess all 
beats and identify “high” and “low” confidence beats using several criteria, including:  
• QT or QTc values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely).  
• RR values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely).  
• Rapid changes in QT, QTc, or RR from beat -to-beat.  
Measurements of all primary ECG parameters (QT, QTc, RR) in all record ed beats of all 
replicates that are deemed “high confidence” will be performed using COMPAS software. 
All low -confidence beats will be reviewed manually and adjudicated using pass- fail criteria. 
The final QC assessment will be performed by a cardiologist. The beats found acceptable by 
manual review will be included in the analysis. The median QT, QTc, and RR value s from 
each extracted replicate will be calculated, and then the mean of all available medians from a nominal timepoint will be used as the subjec t’s reportable value at that timepoint.  
Categorical T -wave morphology analysis and the measurement of PR and QRS interval of the 
ECG (QRS) intervals will be performed manually in 3 of the 10 ECG replicates at each timepoint. Each fiducial point (onset of P -wave, onset of Q -wave, offset of S -wave, and 
offset of T -wave) will be electronically marked.  
For T- wave morphology and U -wave presence, treatment -emergen t changes will be assessed 
(ie, changes not present at baseline). For each category of T -wave morphology and U -waves, 
the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate at the timepoint. For 
baseline, the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate from all timepoints that constitute baseline.  
7.2.2. Safety 12- lead Electrocardiogram  
Resting 12- lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine and at rest for at 
least 5  minutes at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. S ingle 
12-lead ECGs will be repeated twice, and an average taken of the 3 readings, if either of the 
following criteria applies : 
• QT interval corrected for HR using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) is >500 ms 
• QTcF change from the baseline (predose) is >60  ms. 
Additional 12- lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinically 
appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed ass essment of ECGs 
is required. The investigator (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of each 12 -lead 
ECG.

Subjects will be monitored via cardiac telemetry  from approximately 1 hour  prior to dose 
administration and unt il approximately 12 hours postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7 (up- titration 
days; as described in Appendix 6) . Based on the emerging safety data from the st udy, the 
duration of the telemetry may be extended if necessary.  
The start and stop date and time of the telemetry monitoring will be recorded in the eCRFs. 
Clinically significant abnormalities noted from telemetry monitoring will be confirmed by 
12-lead E CG if ne cessary , then after confirming, the abnormities will be reported as AEs in 
the e CRF.  
7.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.3.1. Pharmacokinetic  Blood Sample Collection and Processing  
Blood samples ( approximately 1 ×  3 mL for CBP -307 and moxifloxacin assays) will be 
collected by veni puncture or cannulation at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments  in Appendix 6. Procedures for collection, processing, and shipping of PK blood 
samples will be detailed in a separate document .  
7.3.2. Analytical Methodology 
Plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and moxifloxacin will be determined using a validated 
analytical procedure. Spe cifics of the analytical method  will be provided in a separate 
document.  
7.4. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
7.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions, assignment of severity and causality, and procedures for reporting 
SAEs are detailed in  Appendix 1.  
The condition of each subject will be monitored from the time of signing the ICF until the follow -up visit . Subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their 
condition by open questioning, such as “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”, at least once each day while resident at the study site and each study visit. Subjects will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during the study.  
All nonserious AEs, whether reported by the subject voluntarily or upon questioning,  or 
noted on physical examination, will be recorded from initiation of placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) until study completion. I f AEs that occur in the screening prior to 
placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) are considered to be related to the study 
procedure, they should be also collected. Serious AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the ICF until study completion.  The nature, time of onset, duration, and severity 
will be documented, together with an investigator ’s (or designee’s) opinion of the 
relationship to study treatment.

to resolution or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator  (or designee) to have 
stabilized . This will be completed at the investigator’s (or designee’s ) discretion.  
7.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations  at the times 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Clinical laboratory evaluations are 
listed in Appendix 2.  
A serum qualitative pregnancy or urine test (females only) and follicle -stimulating hormone  
test (postmenopausal females only) will be performed at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix 6. A positive urine pregnancy test will  be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. 
All pregnancies should be reported as specified in Appendix  1. 
Additional clinical laboratory evaluations w ill be performed at other times if judged to be 
clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of clinical laboratory safety evaluations is required. At the discretion of the investigator, clinically signifi cant clinical laboratory assessments may be confirmed by repeat 
sampling. If the clinical significance is confirmed, subjects will be excluded from 
participation or, if already included, will be followed until normalization of the test result or for as lon g as the investigator considers necessary.  
Subjects will be asked to provide urine samples for drugs of abuse screen  and cotinine test , 
and will undergo an alcohol breath test  at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
in Appendix  6. For all female subjects, a pregnancy test will be performed at the times 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6.   
An investigator ( or designee)  will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical laboratory data.  
7.4.3. Vital Signs  
Supine  blood pressure, supine pulse rate , respiratory rate, and tympanic temperature will be 
assessed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Vital signs 
may also be performed at other times if ju dged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing 
review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of vital signs is required.  
All measurements will be performed singly . For all subjects, the screening, check -in, or 
baseline blood pressure, pulse r ate, and respiratory rate may be repeated after 5 to 10 minutes 
if the initial reading is believed to be atypical for the subject.  
Subjects must be supine  for at least 5  minutes before blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements.  
7.4.4. Physical Examination  
A full physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Appendix 6. Physical examinations include general appearance, head, eyes,

gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, skin,  and other s. 
Height, weight, and body mass index  will be assessed at screening.  
8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (a t least  30% for each sex ) will be randomized into 
2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 s ub-groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects.  
Sample S ize for P rimary A nalysis:  
A sample size of 28 evaluable subjects per treatment group will provide more than 9 4.4% 
power to exclude that CBP -307 causes more than 10- msec QTc effect at clinically relevant 
plasma levels, as shown by the upper bound of the 2- sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of 
the model -predicted QT effect (ΔΔ QTcF) at the observed geometric mean C max of CBP -307 
in the study. This power is estimated approximately using a 2 -sample t -test. The calculation 
assumes a 1- sided 5% significance level, a n underlying effect of CBP -307 of 3 msec and a 
standard deviation (SD) of the ΔQTcF of 8 msec for both CBP -307 and placebo treatment 
groups . Note that this cal culation is conservative, since it does not take into account any gain 
in precision due to the use of all data of each subject with the help of a linear mixed -effects 
model. The concentration- QTc analysis method is supported by Darpo et al 20153 and 
Ferber  et al, 2015,4 and consistent with the experiences from 25 recent TQT studies.  
Sample Size Considerations for Assay Sensitivity : 
To demonstrate assay sensitivity with concentration- QTc analysis, it has to be  shown that the 
ΔΔQTcF of a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin exceeds 5 msec (ie, the lower bound of the 
2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc effect [ΔΔQTcF] should exceed 5 msec). In a similarly 
designed, recent crossover study with 24 healthy subjects  (on-file data , ERT) , the standard 
error (SE) for the prediction of the QT effect of moxifloxacin based on the exposure -response 
analysis was 1.24 msec. The within -subject SD of ΔQTcF in the referred study was 5.4 msec  
based on the by- timepoint analysis. If the effect of moxifloxacin is assumed to be 10 msec, 
the SE of 1.24 msec corresponds to an effect size of (10- 5)/(1.24×sqrt[24])=0.82, where the 
effect size is the effect assumed under the alternative hypothesis divided by the SD of the test variable. This value should be compared to the effect size of 0. 64 required to guarantee a 
power of at least 95% in a paired  t-test situation with a sample size of 28  evaluable subjects. 
In other words, based on this calculation, a power of at least 9 5% will be obtained as long as 
the variability of the ΔQTcF, as measured by its within -subject SD  from the by- timepoint 
analysis , does not exceed 6.9 msec (ie, 1 28% [= 0.82/0.64] o f the 5.4 msec observed in the 
referred study  assuming the ratio of effective sizes is consistent with inverse ratio of 
within -subject SD ). The number also agrees with recent recommendations of the FDA, which 
propose at least 20 subjects .

8.2.1. Cardiodynamic Population  
The QT/QTc population will include all subjects in the safety population with measurements 
at baseline as well as on -treatment with at least 1 postdose timepoint with a valid ΔQTcF 
value. The QT/QTc populati on will be used for the by- timepoint and categorical analyses of 
the cardiodynamic ECG parameters.  
The PK/QTc population will include all subjects who are in both the QT/QTc and PK 
populations with at least 1 pair of postdose PK and ∆ QTcF data from the same timepoint as 
well as subjects in the QT/QTc population who received placebo. The PK/QTc population 
will be used for the concentration -QTc analysis and assay sensitiv ity. PK/QTc population 
will be defined for CBP -307, and for moxifloxacin.  
The as- treated principle will be applied to all analysis populations mentioned below. 
8.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product  and have evaluable PK data  of any of the analytes (CBP -307 and moxifloxacin) . A 
subject will be excluded from the PK summary statistics and statistical analysis if the  subject 
has an AE of vomiting that occurs at or before 2 times median time to maximum 
concentration.  
8.2.3. Safety Population  
The safety population will include all  subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product drug (therapeutic and supra therapeutic doses of CBP -307, moxifloxacin, or  placebo) . 
8.3. Cardiodynamic ECG Analyses  
Baseline  for Cardiodynamic ECG Assessments  
Baseline for the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 ( CBP -307 in Group 1 versus 
placebo  in Groups 2A and 2B ) will be time -matched values on Day - 1.  
For assay sensitivity  in Groups 2A and 2B , the following baselines will be used:  
• Group 2A: For moxifloxacin administered  on Day 1, baseline will be Day 16, on 
which subjects are administer ed placebo. For placebo- correction in this group, 
placebo values will be derived from Day 15 on which subjects are administered 
placebo, and baseline will be obtained on Day - 1. 
• Group 2B: For moxifloxacin administere d on Day 16, baseline will be Day 1, on 
which subjects are adminis tered  placebo. For the placebo -correction in this group, 
Day - 1 values will be used as placebo (no treatment) and  baseline will be obtained on 
Day 15.

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 43 of 66  Concentration- QTc Analysis  (Primary Analysis)  
The relationship between CBP -307 plasma concentrations and change -from -baseline QTcF 
(∆QTcF) will be quantified using a linear mixed- effects modeling approach with ΔQTcF as 
the dependent variable, time -matched concentrations of CBP -307 as  the exploratory variate  
(0 for placebo), treatment (act ive=1 or placebo=0) , and time (ie , postbaseline timepoints on 
Days 1, 6, and 15 categorical ) as fixed effects , and a random intercept and slope per subject.6  
The degrees of freedom estimates will be determined by the Kenward -Roger method. From 
the model, the slope (ie , the regression parameter for the CBP -307 concentration) and the 
treatment effec t-specific intercept will be estimated together with 2 -sided 90% CI . The 
estimates for the time effect will be reported with degrees of freedom and SE.  
For the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 versus placebo, the time term incorporated 
into the mod els (both by- time point analysis and concentration -QTc analysis [or assay 
sensit ivity]) includes the single pre dose timepoint and all post dose time points on Days 1, 6, 
and 15, and Days 1 and 16 for active versus placebo and moxifloxacin versus placebo, 
respectively. All times are relative to the time of dosing on that day which is considered the first dose for the assay sensitivity analysis. For the analysis of CBP -307 versus placebo , the 
first dose of study treatment is on Day 1. 
The geometric mean of the individual C
max values for CBP -307 concentrations for subjects in 
the active drug groups on each of Days 6 and 15 will be determined, respectively. The predicted effect and its 2 -sided 90% CI for placebo- corrected change- from- baseline QTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) (ie , slope estimate × concentration + treatment effect -specific intercept) at this 
geometric mean C
max will be obtained.  
To evaluate the adequacy of model fit with respect to the assumption of linearity, the observed ΔQTcF values adjusted by population time effect estimated from the model will be used. These individual placebo- adjusted ΔQTcF
i,k (ΔΔQTcF i,k) values equal the observed 
individual ΔQTcF i,k for subject i administered with active drug or placebo at timepoint k 
minus the estimated population mean pl acebo effect at timepoint k (ie , time effect). A decile 
plot, i e, plot of the deciles of observed concentrations and the mean placebo -adjusted ΔQTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) and 90% CI at the median concentration within each decile will be given. The regression line presen ting the model -predicted ΔΔQTcF
7 will be added to evaluate the fit of a 
linear model and visualize the concentration -response relationship. The place bo-adjusted 
ΔQTcF i,j equals the individual ΔQTcF i,j for subject i administered with CBP -307 at timepoint 
j minus the estima tion of time at timepoint j (ie , time effect). Additional exploratory analyses 
(via graphical displays and/or model fitting) will inc lude accounting for a delayed effect 
(hysteresis) and the justification for the choice of PD  model (linear versus nonlinear) as 
follows.  
Criteria for N egative QT A ssessment  
If the upper bound of the 2- sided 90%  CI of the  predicted QTc effect of ΔΔQTcF at the 
observed geometric mean Cmax on Days  6 and 15  as well as clinically relevant plasma leve ls 
is below 10 msec (ie,  the upper bound of the 2- sided 90% CI at the geometric mean C max 
Protocol Amendment 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 44 of 66  <10 msec), it can be concluded that CBP -307 does not cause clinically concerning QT 
prolongation within the observed plasma concentration ranges.  
Investigation of H ysteresis  
Hysteresis will be assessed based on joint graphical displays of the least squares (LS) mean 
ΔΔQTcF for each postbaseline timepoint and the mean concentration of CBP -307 at the same 
timepoints. In addition, hysteresis plots will be given for LS mean ΔΔQTcF and the mean 
concentrat ions. If a QT effect (ΔΔQTcF) > 10 msec cannot be excluded from the by -timepoint 
analysis in the a ctive dose groups on Days 6 and 15; and the mean peak ΔΔQTcF effe ct is 
observed at the same timepoint in the by- timepoint analysis in the active dose groups on 
Days  6 and 15; and if the difference (delay ) between the time to reach the  peak QT c effect 
(ΔΔQTcF) and peak plasma concentration (t max) in the plot (ΔΔQTcF versus CBP -307) of 
more than 1 hour is observed in a consisten t way for the active dose groups on Days 6 and 15, 
other concentration -QTc models, such as a model with an effect compar tment, may be 
explored. With the provision stated above, hysteresis will be assumed if this curve shows a counterclockwise loop. A significant treatment effect- specific intercept may also be 
indicative of hysteresis  or model misspecification , if it cannot be explained by a nonlinear 
relationship.  
Appropriateness of a L inear M odel 
To assess the appropriateness of a linear model, normal quantile -quantile  plots for the 
standardized residuals and the random effects, scatter  plots of standardized residuals versu s 
concentration and versus fitted values , and box plots of standardized residuals versus nominal 
time and versus active treatment will be produced. The scatter plot of standardized residuals versus conc entration by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing  (LOESS)  fitting (ie , locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing
8 lines ) also will be produced with an optimal smoothing 
parameter selected by the Akaike information criterion with a correction.9 In addition, a 
scatter plot of observed concentration and ΔQTcF with a LOESS smooth line with 90% CI and a linear regression line will also be provided to check the assumption of a linear concentration -QTc relati onship. If there is an indication that a linear model is inappropriate, 
additional models may be fitted, such as an E -max model . The concentration- QTc analysis 
will then be repeated for the model found to best accommodate the nonlinearity detected.  
Assay S ensitivity  
Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by similar concentration -QTc analysis of 
moxifloxacin data. If the slope of the concentration- QTc (change -from- baseline QTcF) for 
moxifloxacin is statistically significant at 10% level for 2 -sided test and the lower bound of 
the 2- sided 90% CI of the predicted effect is above 5 msec at the observed geometric mean 
C
max of the 400- mg dose, assay sensitivity will be deemed to have been demonstrated.  
By-Time point Analysis  
The analysis for QTcF for CBP -307 versus placebo will be based on a linear mixed -effects 
model with change -from -baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) as the dependent variable, time (ie , 
postbaseline timepoint s on Days 1, 6, and 15: categorical), treatment (therapeutic dose of 
CBP -307 and supra therapeutic dose of CBP -307 on Day 15, and corresponding placebo), and

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 45 of 66  time-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be 
specified fo r the repeated measures at post dose timepoints within subjec ts. If the model with 
unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices such as 
compound symmetry and autoregressive will be considered. From this analysis, the LS  mean , 
SE, and 2- sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the contrast “CBP -307 versus placebo” for 
each day of Days 1, 6, and 15 at each postbaseline timepoint on Days 1, 6, and Day 15, 
respectively . 
The by- time point analysis for QTc F will be also performed for moxifloxacin versus placebo 
at post baseline timepoints on Day 1 and Day 16. A linear mixed -effects model will be used 
with ΔQTcF as the dependent variable and time (ie, postbaseline timepoint s on Days 1 and 
16: categorical), treatment (moxifloxacin and placebo), sequence (placebo/moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin/placebo), and time -by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be specified fo r the repeated measures at postbaseline time points for 
subject within visit. The model will also include a subject- specific random effect. If the 
model with an unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices, 
such as compound symmetry or autoregressive, will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean , SE,  and 2- sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the contrast “moxifloxa cin versus 
placebo” at each postbaseline tim epoint , respectively . 
For HR, PR, and QRS intervals, the analysis will be based on the change -from -baseline 
postdose (ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS). The same (by -timepoint analysis) model will be used as 
described for QTcF. The LS mean, SE, and 90% CI from the statistical modeling for both change -from -baseline and placebo -corrected change -from- baseline values will be listed in the 
tables and graphically displayed.  
Categorical Analyses  
The analysis results for categorica l outliers, T -wave morphology, and U -wave presence will 
be summarized in frequency tables with counts (percentages) for both the number of subjects and the number of timepoints. For categorical outliers, the number (percenta ge) of subjects as 
well as time points who had increases  in absolute QTcF values > 450 and ≤480 msec, >480 
and ≤500 msec, or >500 msec, and changes from pre dose base line of >30 and ≤60 msec, or 
>60 msec; increase in PR from pre dose baseline >25% to a PR  > 200 msec; increase in QRS 
from pre dose baseline > 25% to a QRS > 120 msec; decrease in HR from pr edose baseline 
>25% to a n HR < 50 bpm; and increase in HR from pr edose baseline >25% to a n HR 
>100 bpm will be determined. For T -wave morphology and U -wave presence, the analyses 
will be focused o n change fr om baseline (ie , treatment- emergent changes).  
8.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mean, SD , median, minimum, 
maximum  geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation ) separately by group. 
Individual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time data will 
be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data may be provided as well.

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 46 of 66  For each subject, the following PK parameters will be calculated, wh enever possible, based 
on the plasma concentration for CBP -307 and moxifloxacin, according to the model 
independent approach:  
• Cmax

• t1/2  
• apparent total clearance (CL/F)  
• apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V z/F)  
• Accumulation ratio (R ac) for C max (R ac[Cmax] ) and R ac(AUC0 -24), calculated as Day 15 
Cmax/Day 7 C max and Day 15 AUC 0-24/Day 7 AUC 0-24, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed, if appropriate, using commercial software 
such as Phoenix® WinNonlin® (Version 8.1 or higher).  
Other parameter s may be added as appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as recorded on the eCRF. Other data handling 
procedures will be detaile d in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
8.5. Safety Analysis  
All AEs will be listed and treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized using the descriptive 
methodology. Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Observed values for clinical laboratory test data, 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, and physical 
examination findings will be listed.

Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 49 of 66  Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subjec t or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including a  clinically significant  abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not related to the study 
treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that had increased 
in severity or frequency since the administration of study medication.  
Examples of AEs include:  
• Symptoms described by the subject, or signs observed by the investigator, and 
• Abnormal findings (involving clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, ECG, etc.)  
• Exacerbation of previous condition, including increased incidence and/or severity.  
Note: Regarding decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood in this study, ple ase report 
them as follows:  
• Since a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood is due to the mechanism of action of the drug, it  is not to be reported as an AE. However, clinical diagnosis 
related to a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood indicates AE reporting (if no diagnosis is available, it is required to report related clinical symptoms or signs).  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study subject. In addition, each study subjec t will be questioned about AEs. All AEs will 
be recorded in the medical records and eCRFs. The investigator (or designee) is to record in 
detail any AE that occurred to the subject, including: AE diagnosis whenever possible, or signs , symptoms, the start d ate and time of occurrence, the stop date and tim e of occurrence, 
seriousness (ie, whether it is a n SAE), severity of AEs, causality assessment, actions taken on 
the investigational product, other actions (eg, medications/treatments given), and outcomes of  
AEs.  
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator  will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE  using the 
following categories:  
• Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living.  
• Moderate : Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Protocol Amendment 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 50 of 66  • Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly  affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . 
Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator  (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study treatment  using a 4-category system according to the following guidelines:  
• Not Related : The AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study 
procedure/conditions . 
• Unlikely Related : The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that 
the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE . 
• Possibly Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the 
study procedures/conditions . 
• Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of 
the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized 
cause- effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced.  
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Every reasonable effort will be made to follow  up with subjects who have AEs. Any subject 
who has an ongoing AE  that is  possi bly related or related to the  IMP  or study procedures at 
the follow -up visit will be followed up, where possible, until resolution or until the 
unresolved AE is judged by the investigator (or designee) to have stabilized . This will be 
completed at the investigator ’s (or designee’s) discretion.  Any subject who has an ongoing 
AE that is not related or unlikely related to the IMP or study procedures at the follow -up visit  
can be closed out as ongoing at the investigator ’s discretion.   
Adverse Drug Reactions 
All noxious and unintended responses to an IMP ( ie, where a causal relationship between an 
IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered 
adverse drug reactions.  
For marketed medicinal  products, a response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and 
which  occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases 
or modification of physiological function is to be considered an adverse drug reaction. 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, I B for an unapproved 
IMP).  
Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs will be collected after subjec ts sign the informed consent form and  throughout the 
entire study, ie , until the e nd-of-study as specified in the protocol (or at early termination).  
Protocol Amendment 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 51 of 66  An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose either:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• results in an important medical event (see below) . 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medic al judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Instances of death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the investigator  at 
any tim e after cessation of the study treatment and considered by the investigator  to be 
possibly related to the study treatment, will be reported to the sponsor  (or designee) . 
Definition of Life -threatening  
An AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred (ie, does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). For instance, drug -induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of 
hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis 
can be fatal.  
Definition of Hospitalization  
Adverse events requiring hospitalization should be considered serious. In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually  involving an overnight 
stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate at the  study site . When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or 
was necessary, the AE should be considered as s erious.  
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures, which are not the result of an AE, need not be considered A Es and should be recorded on a clinical assessment f orm and 
added to the e CRF . If anything untoward is reported during t he procedure, this must be 
reported as an AE and either ‘serious’ or ‘nonserious’ attributed according to the usual criteria.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator  will complete an SAE report form and forward it by facsimile  or email  to 
Labcorp APAC Drug Safety  and the sponsor  immediately (within 24  hours) upon becoming 
aware of an SAE.  
Protocol Amendment 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 52 of 66  All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) to: +61 -2-8879-2000  
SAE Reporting email: SAEIntake@ labcorp .com (preferred method)  
Labcorp  Safety SAE Reporting Fax Number:  61-2-6100- 9788 or 1800-882- 203 (toll free)  
The responsibilities of Labcorp APAC Drug Safety  include the following:  
• Prepare an AE reporting plan prior to the start of the study. Where this plan differs 
from the applicable study site  standard operating procedure on SAE reporting, the 
safety management p lan will always take precedence.  
• Receive and review SAE report forms from the study site  and inform the sponsor  of 
the SAE within 1 working day of the initial notification to Labcorp APAC Drug 
Safety  who will delete any information from the SAE report forms that may identify 
the subject.  
• Write case narratives and enter the case into Labcorp ’s safety database as defined in 
the AE reporting plan . 
• Produce appropriate reports of all suspected unexpected serious adverse r eactions and 
forward them to the EC , Medicines and Healthca re Products Reg ulatory Agency, 
principal investigator, and the sponsor  within the timeframes stipulated in the Clinical 
Trials Directive Guideline (ENTR/CT  3).  
The responsibility for reporting SAEs will be transferred to the sponsor  28 days after the end 
of the study.  
For SAEs, the active reporting period to sponsor or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent through to the last subject  visit.  
Nonserious  AEs should be collected from the time the subject  has taken the placebo dose on 
Day - 1 through the last subject  visit. If AEs that occur in the screening prior to the placebo 
administration to all subjects on Day - 1 are considered to be related to the stu dy procedure, 
they should be also collected.  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  
Each AE is to be assessed to deter mine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, the 
sponsor should be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event. This time 
frame also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded SAE 
reports as w ell as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the  
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his or her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the sponsor in 
accordance with the ti me frames for reporting as specified above. In addition, an investigator 
Protocol Amendment 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 53 of 66  may be requested by the sponsor to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on 
the AE e CRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow 
for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the sponsor 
or its designated representative.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy (mater nal or paternal exposure to study treatment) does not meet the definition of 
an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported 
following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus.  
If the fema le subject becomes pregnant during the clinical trial and has not yet been dosed 
with study treatment, she must be withdrawn from the study. If the female subject becomes 
pregnant during the clinical trial and has been dosed, she must discontinue treatment 
immediately  but may remain on study for safety evaluations . If the partner of a male subject 
becomes pregnant during the clinical trial, the subject can continue the clinical trial.  
For pregnancy of female subjects or partners of the male subjects during this study, investigators should report to the sponsor or designee in a pregnancy report form within 24 hours after investigator awareness and report to the EC  in time as per local requirement.  
The investigator will follow up on pregnancy outcomes, until not less than 12 months  after 
birth, unless otherwise justified , and will report the outcome to the s ponsor and e thics 
committee.  
If any adverse pregnancy outcome (eg, the outcome of the  pregnancy is stillbirth, 
spontaneous abortion, or fetal malformations ), it should be considered as an SAE and be 
reported in accordance with SAE reporting requirements.

a medical condition such as anorexia nerv osa, hypothyroid disease or polycystic 
ovarian disease, or by extreme exercise. It should not be due to concomitant 
medications that may have induced the amenorrhea such as oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotropin -releasing hormones, anti -estrogens, or selective estrogen 
receptor modulators. Females on hormone replacement therapy with FSH levels <40 mIU/mL may be included at the discretion of the investigator.   
Fertile male: a male that is considered fertile after puberty.  
Infertile male: permanently st erile male via bilateral orchiectomy.  
Contraception Guidance  
Female Subjects  
Female subjects who are of nonchildbearing potential will not be required to use contraception. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods (1 primary and 1 secondary method) of birth control from the time of signing the ICF  until 
90 days after the follow -up visit. Primary (non -barrier) methods of contraception include:  
• surgical method performed at least 3 months prior to the screening  visit:  
o bilateral tubal ligation  or bilateral salpingectomy  
o Essure
® (hysteroscopic bilateral tubal occlusion) with confirmation of 
occlusion of the fallopian tubes  
• non-hormonal intrauterine device  or Mirena® (other hormonal intrauterine devices 
will not be allowed) in place for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of the study 
drug 
• vasectomized male partner (sterilization performed at least 90 days  prior to the 
screening  visit, with verbal confirmation of surgical success, and the sole partner for 
the female subject)

Labcorp Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 3.0, 03 August  2021  Page 57 of 66  Secondary (barrier) methods of contraception include:  
• male condom with out spermicide  
• female condom with out spermicide  
• cervical cap with out spermicide (as prescribed ) 
• diaphragm with out spermicide (as prescribed ). 
Female subjects of childbearing potential should refrain from donation of ova from check -in 
(Day -2) until 90 days after the follow -up visit.  
Male Subjects  
Male subjects (even with  a history of vasectomy) with partners of childbearing potential must 
use a male barrier method of contraception (ie, male condom with out spermicide) in addition 
to a second method of acceptable contraception from check -in until 90 days after the 
follow -up visit. Acceptable methods of contraception for female partners include:  
• hormonal injection  
• combined oral contraceptive pill  or progestin/progestogen- only pill  
• combined hormonal patch 
• combined hormonal vaginal ring  
• surgical method (bilateral tubal ligation  or Essure® [hysteroscopic bilateral tubal 
occlusion])  
• hormonal implant  
• hormonal or non- hormonal intrauterine device  
• cervical cap with out spermicide  
• diaphragm with out spermicide . 
An acceptable second method of contraception for male subjects is vasectomy that has been 
performed at least 90 days prior to the screening visit with verbal confirmation of surgical 
success.  
For male subjects (even with a history of vasectomy), sexual intercourse with female partners 
who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be avoided unless condoms are used from the time 
of the first dose until 90  days after the follow -up visit. Male subjects are required to refrain 
from donation of sperm from check -in until 90 days after the follow -up visit.  
Sexual Abstinence and Same -sex Relationships  
Subjects who practice true abstinence, because of the subject’s lifestyle choice (ie, the subject 
should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation), are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a

agree to use contraception as described  previously.  
For subjects who are exclusively in same -sex relationships, contraceptive requirements do not 
apply. If a subject who is in a same -sex relationship at the time of signing the ICF becomes 
engaged in a heterosexual relationship, they must agree  to use contraception as described 
previously.

Protocol Version 2.0, 10 May 2021  Page 2 of 31 The primary changes in this amen dment, along with the rationale  for the/each change as 
appropriate, are: 
1. Update the protocol to add a new CBP-307 dose group (0.05 mg) i n the up-titration 
period. 
2. Update the applicable  assessment timepoints throughout the prot ocol to align with the 
additional dose group added in the up-titration period. 
3. Update the protocol to include a dditional pharmac okinetic (PK) sample collections at 
72 and 96 hours after the final CBP-307 dose on Da y 15 to bette r capture the terminal 
phase PK parameters o f CBP-307 after 0.5 mg multiple doses. 
4. Update the protocol to include  additional PK parameters. 
5. Update the protocol to include  cardiac telemetry monitoring. 
Minor changes: 
1. Minor editorial changes have been made. 
2. The protocol version and date were updated throughout the proto col. 
3. Typographical errors and formatt ing errors were corrected, as n ecessary. 
A detailed summary of changes is presented below: 
Synopsis, Study Design 
Previously read: This will be a Phase I, randomi zed, double-blind, double-dummy,  placebo-controlled, positive-
controlled, single-site, 3-arm study to investigate the effects  of therapeutic and supratherapeutic 
oral doses of CBP-307 on the QTc i nterval in healthy male and f emale subjects. 
Potential subjects will be asked  to read and sign an informed c onsent form (ICF). After informed 
consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establis h subject eligibility to enter the 
study will be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After info rmed consent has been obtained 
but prior to the initiation of s tudy treatment administration, only serious adverse  events (SAEs) 
will be reported. Aft er placebo administra tion to all subjects on Day -1, all adverse events (AEs), 
whether volunteered, e licited, or noted upon  physical examinati on, will be recorded throughout 
the study (ie, from Day -1 until the end of the study).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized 
into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) w ith 32 subjects in each. Group 2  consists of 2 sub-groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and each sub-group will be randomized with 16  subjects. Randomized 
subjects will receive the assign ed study drug as a single dose in the morning on Days 1, 2 to 5, 6 
to 14, and on Day 15 (placebo wil l be administered to all subje cts on Day -1).

Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP-307AU002 
 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10 May 2021  Page 3 of 31 The following tre atments will be administered: 
 A starting dose of CBP-307 fo r titration (0.1 mg, Day 1) 
 A therapeutic dose of CBP-307 (0.2 mg, Day 2 to 5) 
 A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Day 6 to 14) 
 Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and CBP-307) 
 Moxifloxacin (400 mg)  
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine th e assay sensitivity of this study 
with an expected peak QT effect (placebo-corrected change-from- baseline QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) of 
10 to 15 msec. 
Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility  to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administ ration. Subjects will be admitt ed into the study site on Day -2 and 
will remain at the study site unt il discharge on Day 16. Treatm ent administration will occur on 
Days 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 14, and 15 u nder fasting conditions (all s ubjects will receive placebo on 
Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic  electrocardiogram (ECG) monit oring and recording will 
begin at least 25 hours prior to  the administration of study tr eatments on Day 1 and continue 
through 24 hours after the administration of study treatments o n Days 1, 5, 14,  and 15 and at 
corresponding timepoints on the da y before dosing, ie, Day -1. Blood samples for PK analysis 
will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic EC G timepoint. Subjects will 
return to the study site for a f ollow-up visit on Day 28±2 days . 
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predo se timepoints collected for 
25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments  on Day 1). Continuous 
cardiodynamic monitoring (Holte r) will be performed for 25 hour s on Days -1, 1, 5, 14, and 15. 
The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the c orresponding clock time on Day -
1. Replicate 12-lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous  recording prior to dosing (-
30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 , 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdos e on each day. Pharmacokinetic 
blood samples will be collected a t the following timepoints: pr ior to dosing and 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 
8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day (Days 1, 5, 14, and 15; sample 
collection windows are as follows : ±2 minutes for 0.5 hours pos tdose, ±5 minutes for 1 to 4 
hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes for 12 to 24 hours 
postdose). Subjects will be ina ctive and in a supine position f or at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 
minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, whic h will end immediately prior 
to the PK sampling. When timepoint s for ECG extraction, safety ECGs, vital sign measurements, 
and blood draws coincide, proced ures will be performed in said order. At each timepoint, up to 
10 ECG replicates will be extrac ted from a 5-min ute time window  (the last 5 minutes of the 15-
minute period when the subject i s maintained in a supine, quiet  position). The ECG effects of 
CBP-307 will be tested on data fro m Day -1 (baseline for both g roups), Day 5 (therapeutic 
concentrations versus placebo), and Day 14 (supratherapeutic co ncentrations versus placebo). 
Assay sensitivity with moxifloxac in will be evaluated using ECG  data collected on Days -1, 1, 
14, and 15.

Section 8.3, Cardiodynamic ECG Analyses  Previously read: Baseline for Cardiody namic ECG Assessments  
Baseline for the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP-307 (CBP-3 07 in Group 1 versus placebo 
in Groups 2A and 2B) will be ti me-matched value s on Day -1.  
For assay sensitivity in Groups 2 A and 2B, the following baseli nes will be used: 
 Group 2A: For moxifloxacin administered on Day 1, baseline will  be Day 15, on which 
subjects are administered place bo. For placebo-correction in th is group, placebo values 
will be derived from Day 14 on wh ich subjects are administered placebo, and baseline 
will be obtained on Day -1. 
 Group 2B: For moxifloxacin admini stered on Day 15, baseline wil l be Day 1, on which 
subjects are administered place bo. For the placebo-correction i n this group, Day -1 values 
will be used as placebo (no trea tment) and baseline will be obt ained on Day 14. 
Concentration-QTc Analysis (Primary Analysis) 
The relationship between CBP-307  plasma concentrations and chan ge-from-baseline QTcF 
(∆QTcF) will be quantified using a linear mixed-effects modelin g approach with ΔQTcF as the 
dependent variable, time-matche d concentrations of CBP-307 as t he exploratory variate (0 for 
placebo), treatment (active=1 or  placebo=0), and time (ie, post baseline timepoints on Days 1, 5, 
and 14 categorical) as fixed effe cts, and a random intercept an d slope per subject.
6  
The degrees of freedom estimates  will be determined by the Kenw ard-Roger method. From the 
model, the slope  (ie, the regression para meter for the CBP-307 concentration) and the treatment 
effect-specific intercept will be estimated together with 2-sid ed 90% CI. The estimates for the 
time effect will be reported with  degrees of freedom and SE.  
For the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP-307 versus placebo,  the time term incorporated 
into the models (both by-time poi nt analysis and concentration- QTc analysis [or assay 
sensitivity]) includes the singl e predose timepoint and all pos tdose timepoints on Days 1, 5, and 
14, and Days 1 and 15 for acti ve versus placebo and moxifloxaci n versus placebo, respectively. 
All times are relative to the tim e of dosing on that day which is considered the first dose for the 
assay sensitivity analysis. For the analysis of CBP-307 versus placebo, the first dose of study 
treatment is on Day 1.

Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol Reference: CBP-307AU002 
 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10 May 2021  Page 19 of 31 The geometric mean of the individual C max values for CBP-307 concentrat ions for subjects in the 
active drug groups on each of Day s 5 and 14 will be determined,  respectively. The predicted 
effect and its 2-sided 90% CI for placebo-corrected change-from -baseline QTcF (ΔΔQTcF) (ie, 
slope estimate × concentration + treatment effect-specific inte rcept) at this geometric mean C max 
will be obtained.  
To evaluate the adequacy of model fit with respect to the assum ption of linearity, the observed 
ΔQTcF values adjusted by popula tion time effect estimated from the model will be  used. These 
individual placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF i,k (ΔΔQTcF i,k) values equal the observed individual ΔQTcF i,k 
for subject i administered wit h active drug or placebo at timep oint k minus the estimated 
population mean placebo effect at timepoint k (ie, time effect) . A decile plot, ie, plot of the 
deciles of observed concentrations and the mean placebo-adjuste d ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) and 90% 
CI at the median concen tration within each decile will be given . The regression line presenting 
the model-pred icted ΔΔQTcF7 will be added to evaluate the f it of a linear model and visuali ze 
the concentration-response rela tionship. The placebo-adjusted Δ QTcF i,j equals the individual 
ΔQTcF i,j for subject i administe red with CBP-307 at timepoint j minus th e estimation of time at 
timepoint j (ie, time effect). A dditional exploratory analyses (via graphical displays and/or model 
fitting) will include accounting for a delayed e ffect (hysteres is) and the justification for the 
choice of PD model (linear ve rsus nonlinear) as follows. 
Criteria for Negati ve QT Assessment 
If the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc e ffect of ΔΔQTcF at the observed 
geometric mean C max on Days 5 and 14 as well as clinically relevant plasma levels is below 10 
msec (ie, the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI at the geometri c mean C max <10 msec), it can be 
concluded that CBP-307 does not cause clinically concerning QT prolongation within the 
observed plasma concentration ranges.  
Investigation of Hysteresis Hysteresis will be assessed based  on joint graphical displays o f the least squares (LS) mean 
ΔΔQTcF for each postbaseline timep oint and the mean concentrati on of CBP-307 at the same 
timepoints. In addition, hysteresi s plots will be given for LS mean ΔΔQTcF and the mean 
concentrations. If a QT effect (ΔΔQTcF) >10 msec cannot be excl uded from the by-timepoint 
analysis in the active dose gr oups on Days 5 and 14; and the me an peak ΔΔQTcF effect is 
observed at the same timepoint i n the by-timepoint analysis in the active dose groups on Days 5 
and 14; and if the difference (d elay) between the time to reach  the peak QTc effect (ΔΔQTcF) 
and peak plasma concentration (t
max) in the plot (ΔΔQTcF versus C BP-307) of more than 1 hour 
is observed in a consistent way f or the active dose groups on D ays 5 and 14, other concentration-
QTc models, such as a model with an effect c ompartment, may be explored. With the provision 
stated above, hysteresis will be assumed if this curve shows a counterclockwise loop. A 
significant treatment effect-specific intercept may also be ind icative of hysteresis or model 
misspecification, if it cannot be explained by a nonlinear rela tionship.

Protocol Version 2.0, 10 May 2021  Page 20 of 31 Appropriateness of a Linear Model 
To assess the appropriateness of a  linear model, normal quantil e-quantile plots for the 
standardized residuals and the random effects, scatter plots of  standardized residuals versus 
concentration and versus fitted values, and box plots of standa rdized residuals versus nominal 
time and versus active treatment will be produced. The scatter plot of standardized residuals 
versus concentration by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing  (LOESS) fitting (ie, locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing8 lines) also will be produced with an optimal smoothing 
parameter selected by the Akai ke information criterion with a c orrection.9 In addition, a scatter 
plot of observed concentration and ΔQTcF with a LOESS smooth li ne with 90% CI and a linear 
regression line will al so be provided to check the assumption o f a linear concentration-QTc 
relationship. If there is an indication that a linear model is inappropriate, additional models may 
be fitted, such as an E-max model. The concentration-QTc analys is will then be repeated for the 
model found to best accommodat e the nonlinearity detected. 
Assay Sensitivity 
Assay sensitivity will be demons trated by similar concentration -QTc analysis of moxifloxacin 
data. If the slope of the concentration-QTc (change-from-baseli ne QTcF) for moxifloxacin is 
statistically significant at 10% level for 2-sided test and the  lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CI 
of the predicted effect is above 5  msec at the observed geometr ic mean C max of the 400-mg dose, 
assay sensitivity will be deeme d to have been demonstrated. 
By-Timepoint Analysis 
The analysis for QTcF for CBP-30 7 versus placebo will be based on a linear mixed-effects 
model with change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) as the dependent v ariable, time (ie, 
postbaseline timepoints on Days  1, 5, and 14: cat egorical), tre atment (therapeutic dose of CBP-
307 and supratherapeut ic dose of CBP-307 on  Day 14, and corresp onding placebo), and time-by-
treatment interaction as fixed eff ects. An unstructured covaria nce matrix will be specified for the 
repeated measures at postdose tim epoints within subjects. If th e model with unstructured 
covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices such as compound symmetry and 
autoregressive will be considered . From this analysis, the LS m ean, SE, and 2-sided 90% CIs 
will be calculated for the cont rast “CBP-307 versus placebo” fo r each day of Days 1, 5, and 14 at 
each postbaseline timepoint on Days 1, 5, and Day 14, respectiv ely. 
The by-time point analysis for QT cF will be also performed for moxifloxacin versus placebo at 
postbaseline timepoints on Day 1 and Day 15. A linear mixed-eff ects model will be used with 
ΔQTcF as the dependent variable and time (ie, postbaseline time points on Days 1 and 15: 
categorical), treatment (moxifloxacin and placebo), sequence (p lacebo/moxifloxacin or 
moxifloxacin/placebo), and time-by-treatment interaction as fix ed effects. An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be specified for the repeated measures a t postbaseline timepoints for 
subject within visit. The model  will also include a subject-spe cific random effect. If the model 
with an unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other  covariance matrices, such as 
compound symmetry or autoregres sive, will be considered. From t his analysis, the LS mean, SE, 
and 2-sided 90% CIs w ill be calculated for the contrast “moxifl oxacin versus placebo” at each 
postbaseline timepoint, respectively.

Protocol Version 2.0, 10 May 2021  Page 21 of 31 For HR, PR, and QRS intervals, the  analysis will be based on th e change-from-baseline postdose 
(ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS). The same (by-timepoint analysis) model will b e used as described for 
QTcF. The LS mean, SE, and 90% C I from the statistical modeling  for both change-from-
baseline and placebo- corrected change-from-baseline values will  be listed in the tables and 
graphically displayed. 
Categorical Analyses 
The analysis results for categor ical outliers, T-wave morpholog y, and U-wave presence will be 
summarized in frequency tables w ith counts (percentages) for bo th the number of subjects and 
the number of timepoints. For cat egorical outliers, the number (percentage) of subjects as well as 
timepoints who had increases in absolute QTcF values >450 and ≤ 480 msec, >480 and 
≤500 msec, or >500 msec, and chang es from predose baseline of > 30 and ≤60 msec, or 
>60 msec; increase in PR from pr edose baseline >25% to a PR > 2 00 msec; increase in QRS 
from predose baseline >25% to a QR S >120 msec; decrease in HR f rom predose baseline >25% 
to an HR <50 bpm; and increase in HR from predose baseline >25%  to an HR >100 bpm will be 
determined. For T-wave  morphology and U-wave presence, the anal yses will be focused on 
change from baseline (ie, treatment-emergent changes). 
Now reads: Baseline for Cardiody namic ECG Assessments  
Baseline for the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP-307 (CBP-3 07 in Group 1 versus placebo

For assay sensitivity in Groups 2 A and 2B, the following baseli nes will be used: 
 Group 2A: For moxifloxacin administered on Day 1, baseline will  be Day 16, on which

All times are relative to the tim e of dosing on that day which is considered the fi rst dose for the 
assay sensitivity analysis. For the analysis of CBP-307 versus placebo, the first dose of study 
treatment is on Day 1. 
The geometric mean of the individual C max values for CBP-307 concentrat ions for subjects in the 
active drug groups on each of Day s 6 and 15 will be determined,  respectively. The predicted 
effect and its 2-sided 90% CI for placebo-corrected change-from -baseline QTcF (ΔΔQTcF) (ie,

will be obtained.  
To evaluate the adequacy of model fit with respect to the assum ption of linearity, the observed

concentrations. If a QT effect (ΔΔQTcF) >10 msec cannot be excl uded from the by-timepoint 
analysis in the active dose gr oups on Days 6 and 15; and the me an peak ΔΔQTcF effect is

Protocol Version 2.0, 10 May 2021  Page 23 of 31 and 15; and if t he di fferen ce (d elay) between the time to reach the pea k QTc effect (ΔΔ QTcF) 
and peak plasma co ncentratio n (t max) in the plot (ΔΔQTcF versus C BP-307 ) of more than 1 hour 
is observed in a consistent way f or the active dose groups on Days 6 and 15, other concentration-
QTc models , such as a mode l with an effect c ompartment, may be explored. With the pro vision  
stated above, hysteresis will be assumed if this curve shows a counterclockwise loop. A 
significant treatment effect-specific intercept may also be indicative of hystere sis or mo del 
misspecification, if it cannot be explained by a nonlinear rela tionship. 
Appropriateness of a Linear Model 
To assess the appropriateness of a linear model, normal quantile-qu antile plots for t he 
standardized resi duals and the random effects, scatter plots of stan dardized residuals v ersus 
concentration and versus fitte d values, and box p lots of standa rdized residuals versus no minal 
time and versu s activ e treatment will be produ ced. The scatte r plot of standardized residuals 
versus concen tration by locally estimated scatterplot smoo thing (LOESS) fitting (ie, locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing8 lines) also will be produced with an optimal smoothing 
parameter selected  by the Akaike information criterion with a correctio n.9 In addition, a scatter 
plot of observed concentration an d ΔQTcF with a LOESS smooth li ne wi th 90% CI and a linear 
regression line will also be provided to check the assumption of a line ar concentration-QTc 
relationship. If there is an indication that a linear mod el is inappropriate, additional models may 
be fitted, such as an E-max mo del. The concentration-QTc analys is will then be repeate d for the 
model found to best accommodate the nonlinearity detec ted. 
Assay S ensitivity 
Assay sensitivity will be demons trated by similar concentration -QTc analysis of moxiflox acin 
data. If the slope of the concentration-QTc (change-from-baseline QTcF) for moxiflox acin is 
statistically si gnificant at 10% lev el for 2-sided te st and the lower bound o f the 2-sided 90 % CI 
of the predicted effect is above 5 msec at th e observed geometr ic mean Cmax of the 400-mg  dose, 
assay sensitivity will be deeme d to have been demonstrated. 
By-Timepoint An alysis 
The analysis for QTcF for CBP-307 versus placeb o will be based on a l inear mixed-effects 
model with ch ange-fr om-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) as the dependent variab le, time (ie, 
postbaseline timepoints on Days 1 , 6, and 15: cat egorical), tre atment (th erapeutic dos e of 
CBP-307 and suprathera peutic dose of CBP- 307 on Day 15, an d cor responding placebo), and 
time-by-treatment interaction as fi xed effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be 
specif ied for the repeated  measures at postdose timepoints with in subjects. If the model with 
unstructured covariance m atrix fails to converge , other covariance matrices such as compou nd 
symmetry and autoregressive will be considered. From this analy sis, the L S mean, SE, and 2-
sided 90% CIs will b e calculated for the contrast “CBP-307 versus pl acebo” for each day of 
Days 1, 6, and 15 at each postbase line tim epoint o n Days 1, 6, and Day 15, respectively. 
The by-time point analysis for QT cF will be also  performed for moxifloxacin v ersus placebo at 
postbaseline timepoints on Day 1 and Day 16. A linear mixed-eff ects model wi ll be used with 
ΔQTc F as the dependent variabl e and time (i e, postbasel ine timepoints on Days 1 and 16:

moxifloxacin/placebo), and time-by-treatment interaction as fix ed effects. An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be specified for the repeated measures a t postbaseline timepoints for 
subject within visit. The model  will also include a subject-spe cific random effect. If the model 
with an unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other  covariance matrices, such as 
compound symmetry or autoregres sive, will be considered. From t his analysis, the LS mean, SE, 
and 2-sided 90% CIs w ill be calculated for the contrast “moxifl oxacin versus pla cebo” at each 
postbaseline timepoint, respectively. 
For HR, PR, and QRS intervals, the  analysis will be based on th e change-from-baseline postdose 
(ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS). The same (by-timepoint analysis) model will b e used as described for 
QTcF. The LS mean, SE, and 90% C I from the statistical modeling  for both change-from-
baseline and placebo- corrected change-from-baseline values will  be listed in the tables and 
graphically displayed. 
Categorical Analyses 
The analysis results for categor ical outliers, T-wave morpholog y, and U-wave presence will be 
summarized in frequency tables with counts (percentages) for bo th the number of subjects and 
the number of timepoints. For cat egorical outliers, the number (percentage) of subjects as well as 
timepoints who had increases in absolute QTcF values >450 and ≤ 480 msec, >480 and 
≤500 msec, or >500 msec, and chang es from predose baseline of > 30 and ≤60 msec, or 
>60 msec; increase in PR from pr edose baseline >25% to a PR > 2 00 msec; increase in QRS 
from predose baseline >25% to a QR S >120 msec; decrease in HR f rom predose baseline >25% 
to an HR <50 bpm; and increase in HR from predose baseline >25%  to an HR >100 bpm will be 
determined. For T-wave  morphology and U-wave presence, the anal yses will be focused on 
change from baseline (ie, treatment-emergent changes).

The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic CBP -307 plasma 
concentrations on the heart -rate corrected QT interval (QTc) in healthy subjects.  
The secondary objective s of the study are:  
• To demonstrate assay sensitivity of the study to detect a small QT effect using 
moxifloxacin as a positive control.  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple 
oral doses of CBP -307 in healthy subjects.  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of CBP -307 following administration of 
therapeutic and supratherapeutic mul tiple oral doses in healthy subjects.  
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses of 
CBP -307 on heart rate (HR), PR and QRS intervals, and T -wave morphology. 
Study Design 
This will be a Phase I, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, placebo -controlled, 
positive -controlled, single -site, 3 -arm study to investigate the effects of therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic oral doses of CBP -307 on the QTc interval in healthy male and female 
subjects.  
Potential subjects will be asked to read and sign an informed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eligibility to 
enter the study will be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After informed consent has 
been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported. After placebo  administration to all subjects on 
Day - 1, all adverse events (AEs), whether volunteered, elicited, or noted upon physical 
exam ination, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from Day - 1 until the end of the 
study).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 2 groups ( Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 
2 sub- groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subject s. 
Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the morning on

Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 7 of 66  Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and on Day 16 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on 
Day - 1).  
The following treatments will be administered:  
• Starting dose s of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  followed by an up- titrated 
dose of 0.1 mg on Day 2)  
• A therapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.2 mg, Days  3 to 6)  
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Days  7 to 15)  
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and CBP -307) 
• Moxifloxacin (400 mg)  
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study with an expected peak QT effect (placebo -corrected change- from -baseline  QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec.  
Potential subjects will  be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day  -2 
and will remain at the study site until discharge on Day  19. Treatment administration  will 
occur on Days 1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and 16 under fasting conditions  (all subjects will receive 
placebo on Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic electrocardiogram (ECG ) monitoring and 
recording will begin at least 25  hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day  1 
and continue through 24  hours after the administration of study treatments on Day s 1, 6, 15, 
and 16 and at corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day - 1. Blood samples 
for PK analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint . Additional  PK samples will be collected  at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on 
Day 15. Subjects will return to the  study sit e for a follow -up visit on Day 29±2  days.  
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on Day 1). Continuous 
cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Day s -1, 1, 6, 1 5, and 
16. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day -1. Replicate 12- lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to 
dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples  will be collected at the following timepoints: prior t o dosing 
and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day (Days 1, 6, 
15, and 16; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5  hour s postdose, 
±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hour s postdose, and ±30 minutes 
for 12 to 24 hours postdose ). Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours 
following dosing on Day 15 (sample collection window: ±30 minutes ). Subjects will be 
inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which will end immediately prior to the PK 
sampling. When timepoints for ECG extraction, safety ECGs, vital sign measurements, and 
blood draws coincide, procedures will be pe rformed in said order. At each timepoint, up to

Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 8 of 66  10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time window (the last 5 minutes of the 
15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine, quiet position). The ECG effects 
of CBP -307 will be test ed on data from Day - 1 (baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic 
concentrations versus placebo), and Day 15 (supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). 
Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be evaluated using ECG data collected on Days - 1, 
1, 15, and 16. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to 
treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in the analyses will 
be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, safety 12- lead ECGs , 
and physical examination f indings will be performed at screening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow -up visit. In addition, subjects will be monitored via 
cardiac telemetry at specific timepoints during the treatment period.  
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening through follow -up 
visit) is anticipated to be approximately 59 days.  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first subject signs an ICF. The point of 
enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled).  
Number of Subjects  
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects.

Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 9 of 66  • Moxiflox acin (400 mg; oral tablet) . 
Duration of Subject Participation in the Study  
Duration of subject participation from the screening visit through follow -up visit  will be up to 
approximately 26 days for screening period (Days - 28 to - 3), 21 days for the in-house  
treatment period (Days -2 to 19) , and 10 ± 2 days for follow -up (Day 29± 2 days) , in total 
approximately 59 days.  
Endpoints  
Electrocardiogram (Cardiodynamic):  
The primary cardiodynamic endpoint is the change -from- baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF).  
The secondary cardiodynamic  endpoints are:  
• Change -from- baseline HR, PR, QRS ( ∆HR, ∆ PR, and ∆ QRS);  
• Placebo -corrected change- from- baseline HR, QTcF, PR, and QRS ( ∆∆HR, ∆∆QTcF, 
∆∆PR, and ∆∆QRS);  
• Categorical outliers for QTcF, HR, PR, and QRS;  
• Frequency of treatment -emergent changes of T - wave morphology and U -wave 
presence.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of plasma concentrations of CBP -307. The 
PK parameters of CBP -307 will be calculated using a model independent approach. The 
following PK parameter endpoints will be calculated: maximum observed conc entration 
(Cmax), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero  extrapolated  to infinity 
(AUC inf), area under the concentration- time curve from time zero to 24 hours postdose 
(AUC 0-24), and time of the maximum observed concentration ( tmax). Other noncompartmental 
parameters may be reported.  
Safety:  
Adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), 
12lead ECGs , and vital signs measurements.  
Statistical Methods  
Cardiodynamic evaluation:  
The primary analysis will be based on concentration -QTc modeling of the relationship 
between plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and change -from -baseline QTcF (∆QTcF) with 
the intent to exclude an effect of placebo -corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) >  10 msec at clinically

ΔΔQRS , and ∆∆QTcF) will also be evaluated at each postdosing timepoint ('by- timepoint' 
analysis). An analysis of categorical outliers will be performed for changes in HR, PR, QRS, 
QTcF, T- wave morphology, and U -wave presence. Assay sensitivity will be evaluated by 
concentration -QTc analysis of the effect on ∆ΔQTcF of moxifloxacin using a similar model 
as for the primary analysis.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
The analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum  geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation) separately by 
cohor t. Individual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time 
data will be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data may be provided as well.  
Pharmaco kinet ic/electrocardiography analyses:  
The relationship between CBP -307 plasma concentrations  and the change from ∆ QTcF will 
be evaluated using a linear mixed- effects modeling approach.  
Safety:  
All AEs  will be listed and treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized using the descriptive 
methodology. Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Observed values for clinical laboratory test data, 12lead ECGs, vital signs, and physical 
examination findings will be listed.

1.1. Disease Background  
Autoimmune diseases are serious disorders that afflict a large portion of the world 
population;  most have no cures. Significant advances have been made in the development of 
novel and disease -modifying therapies, but many of these new tre atments have significant 
side effects. Treatments are needed that provide better risk -to-benefit profiles than the 
existing therapeutic choices.  
T cells are important immune cells that mediate the development of autoimmune disorders. Migration of T cells from lymphoid tissues to the sites of inflammation is central to the functions of T cells, and this process is dependent on sphingosine -1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 
1 (S1P1)  which  is known to ameliorate a variety of autoimmune diseases in animals and 
humans. Down modulation of this receptor, using S1P1 agonists, prevents T cell egress and results in a reduced number of circulating lymphocytes, particularly the CD4+ - and CD8+ -
naïve and central -memory T cell subsets.  
1.2. Overview of CBP -307 
CBP -307 is a n S1P1 agonist that is being developed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases 
by Suzhou C onnect Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. CBP -307 (1 -(2-fluoro -4-(5-(4-isobutylphenyl) -
1,2,4- oxadiazol -3-yl) benzyl)  azetidine -3-carboxylic acid hemihydrate) is a potent, selective,  
small -molecule agonist of S1P1 and S1P5 receptor s. Cell -based assays have confirmed 
CBP -307 induces internalization of S1P1 from the cell surface. This is consistent with the 
known mechanism of action of other S1P1 agonists, in that they down- modulate S1P 1 and 
inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues.  
1.2.1. Summary of Clinical Experience  
The Phase 1 development of CBP -307 comprised 2 completed studies in healthy subjects:  
• A single and multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
CBP -307 including pharmacokinetic ( PK), pharmacodynamic ( PD), and food- effect 
assessments (Study CBP -307AU001)  
• A single -dose and multiple -dose, and fixed- dose titration study to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of CBP -307 including PK and PD  (Study CBP -307CN001)  
Currently, CBP -307 is being evaluated in 2 Phase 2 studies :  
• Ongoing multicenter study in subjec ts with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis 
(Study CBP -307CN002) to compare the clinical efficacy by evaluating the clinical 
response to CBP -307 versus placebo and the  clinical remission and mucosal healing

tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo.  
• Ongoing study in subjec ts with moderate to severe  Crohn’s disease compare s clinical 
efficacy by evaluating the clinical response to CBP -307 versus placebo and the 
clinical remission and mucosal healing achieved by CBP -307 versus placebo  and to 
compare the clinical safety and tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo. 
1.2.1.1.  Safety  
Study CBP -307AU001  
A total of 44 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. There were 28 subjects evaluated 
using the single -dose regimen  (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 2.5 mg CBP -307) of which 21 subjects 
received CBP -307 and 7 subjects receive d placebo. Another 16 healthy subjects were 
evaluated using the multiple -dose regimen ( 0.15 and 0.25 mg CBP -307 given once daily 
[QD] for 28 consecutive days ) of which 12 subjects received  CBP -307 and 4 subjects 
received placebo. 
Overall,  no unexpected safety signals were identified  and no deaths occurred in this study. 
For the  single -dose regiment, no subject s were discontinued due to a treatment- emergent AE 
(TEAE). In the multiple -dose regimen, there were 2 subjects who were discontinued from the 
study (due to increased alanine transaminase and second degree AV block [not cons idered to 
be clinically significant, as judged by the investig ator]). A ll TEAEs resolved by the end of 
the study.  
In the single -dose regimen groups, TEAEs  were reported in 12 of 21 subjects  (57.1%) treated 
with CBP -307 and in 3 of 7 subjects  (42.8%)  treated with placebo. Most (91.7%) of the 
TEAEs in these subjects were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in the 
CBP -307-treated groups were headache (28.6%); dizziness (19.0%); and bradycardia (9.5%). 
Bradycardia was reported only in 2 subjects rece iving the highest (2.5 mg) CBP -307 dose . 
One subject had a serious adverse event (SAE) of bradycardia (associated with transient 
asystole) following a single  dose of 2.5 mg CBP -307. 
In the multiple -dose regimen groups, CBP -307 at doses of 0.15 and 0.25 mg QD was 
generally well tolerated over the 28 days of dosing. Treatment -emergent AEs were reported 
in 11 of 12 subjects (91.7%) in the CBP -307 groups and 2 of 4 subjects (50.0%) in the 
placebo groups. Most (83.3% ) TEAEs were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in 
the 2 CBP -307 groups were headache (50.0%), and fatigue, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain 
(16.7% each). The incidences of these TEAEs were similar in both CBP -307-treated groups. 
No SAEs were reported for subjects in the multiple -dose regimen.  
Study CBP -307CN001  
A total of 30 eligible subjects completed 3 CBP -307 dose groups in ascending order of dose 
after randomization (in a ratio of 1:1:1): Group A (0.1 mg), Group B (0.2 mg), and Group C (0.3 mg). Each dose group consisted of 10 subjects, including 8 subjects receiving the investigational drug and 2 subjects receiving placebo by random assignment. The administration started from the dose of 0.1 mg. The subjects in this group received a single

7 days. Then the subjects received 0.1 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 14 consecutive days 
and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days. Dose escalation did not 
occur until the review of the single -dose regimen safety data from the 6  subjects in the 
previous dose cohort, and the safety data did not meet the termination criteria.  The subjects in 
the dose of 0.3 mg received fi xed-dose titration regimen, ie,  0.05 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD 
for 3  consecutive days;  0.1 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days ; 0.2 mg CBP -
307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days ; finally,  0.3 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 
14 consecutive days, and the subjects were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days.  
Overall, no unexpected safety signals were identified, and there were no deaths,  SAEs, or 
AEs leading to the subject’s early withdrawal from the study after administration of CBP -
307. In the safety set, a total of 29 subjects ( 8 in Group A, 100%; 8 i n Group B, 100%; 8 in 
Group C, 100% and 5 in placebo group, 83.3%) experienced TEAEs.  
During the single -dose period, a total of 14 subjects (5 of 8 in Group A, 62.5%; 6 of 8 in 
Group B, 75%, and 3 of 4 in placebo group, 75%) developed AEs. T he incidence of  TEAEs 
in Group A was generally similar to the placebo group. Among TEAEs in Group B, the incidence of AEs related to abnormalities in investigations was higher than that in placebo group, including lymphocyte count decreased (12.5%), white blood cell ( WBC)  count 
decreased (12.5% ), neutrophil count decreased ( 12.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased 
(25%), and gamma -glutamyltransferase increased (12.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased (12.5%). Additionally, 1 subject experienced heart rate (HR) decreased (12.5%).  
During dose -titration period, 2 subjects (2 of 8 in Group C, 25%) experienced TEAEs. The 
TEAEs reported in Group C during the titration period included cough (12.5%) and increased upper airway secretion (12.5%). There were no TEAEs in the placebo group during this period.  
During repeated- dose period, a total of 28 subjects (8 of 8 in Group A, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group 
B, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group C, 100%; and 4 of 6 in placebo group, 66.7%) experienced AEs. The most frequent TEAE in Group A was uppe r respiratory tract infection ( 37.5%) compared 
with placebo group; the most frequent TEAEs in Group B and Group C included decreased lymphocyte count (Group B, 87.5%; Group C, 100.0%), WBC  count ( Group B, 87.5%; 
Group C, 62.5%), and neutrophil count ( Group B, 50%; Group C, 12.5%). The TEAEs noted 
in Group B during the repeated -dose period also included increased alanine aminotransferase 
(25%), gamma -glutamyltransferase (37.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase (12.5%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (12 .5%), influenza (12.5%), chest pain (12.5%), lethargy (25%), 
and neck pain (12.5%); TEAEs in Group C during the repeated- dose period also included 
increased alanine aminotransferase (25%), decreased HR (12.5%), and mouth ulcer (12.5%); the TEAEs in placebo  group included increased transaminase (16.7%), prolonged activated 
partial thromboplastin time (1/6, 16.7%), decreased hemoglobin (16.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (16.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), dizziness (16.7%), and palpitations (16.7%).

1.2.1.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
CBP -307 given orally as a single dose  was readily absorbed; drug concentrations peaked at 
approximately 6 hours after administration, with an elimination apparent terminal elimination 
half-life (t1/2) of approximately 25 hours (range of 23 to 29 hours). The time to maximum 
observed concentrat ion (Cmax) in the blood was delayed from 6 hours to approximately 
10 hours when CBP -307 was given with a high -fat diet. Food consumption also increased 
exposure  (Table  1). 
For the single -dose ad ministration, CBP -307 exposure  (based on C max and area under the 
concentration -time curve  [AUCs ]) increased with increasing dose following a single -dose 
administration  (Table  1).

1.3. Overview of Moxifloxacin  
Moxifloxacin is a broad -spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that binds to and inhibits the 
hERG IKr α subunit and causes a mean increase of the QTc interval of 6 ms after a single 
400-mg oral dose. Moxifloxacin is commonly used as a positive control in thorough QT 
(TQT) studies to satisfy the requirements of International Council for/Conference on 
Harmonisation  (ICH)  E14. 
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert of AVELOX (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) tablets for additional information.

1.4. Study Rationale  
Regulatory guidance (ICH E14) has emphasized the need to obtain clear robust data on the effect of new chemical entities on electrocardiogram ( ECG)  parameters with focus on cardiac 
repolarization as measured by  the QTc duration. Though many Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials may be 
conducted they usually have an insufficient sample size, infrequent sampling of ECG data, or 
the use of inadequate controls to overcome the high rate of spontaneous change in QTc duration. This has resulted in regulatory guidance recommending a dedicated or thorough trial to define the ECG effects of new drugs.  
This study will be done in healthy subjects to eliminate variables known to have an effect on ECG parameters (concomitant drugs, diseases, etc.). A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 i s 
required to mimic the exposure in healthy subjects that may occur in the target population under the worst of circumstances (eg, concomitant use of cytochrome P450  [CYP ]3A4

dose prescribed) and to allow for PK to QTc modeling to assess the effect of drug 
concentration on cardiac repolarization. 
1.5. Benefit -risk Assessment  
Healthy subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an 
assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study . The risks of participation 
are primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there 
may also be some discomfort from the collection of blood samples and other study 
procedures. More information about the known and expected benefits, risks , and reasonably 
anticipated AEs associated with CBP -307 may be found in the I B.1

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This will be a Phase I, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, placebo -controlled, 
positive-controlled, single -site, 3- arm study to investigate  the effect s of therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic oral doses of CBP -307 on the QTc interval in he althy male and f emale 
subjects.  
Potential subjects will be asked to read and sign an i nformed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eligibility to 
enter the study will be performed within 28 days before  Day 1. After informed consent has 
been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only SAEs  will be 
reported. After placebo  administration to all subjects on Day -1, all AEs, whether

study (ie , from Day - 1 until the end of the study).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects ( at least  30% for each sex ) will be 
randomized into 2 groups  (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 
2 sub- groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects . 
Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the mornin g on 
Days 1, 2, 3 t o 6, 7 to 15, and on Day 16 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on 
Day - 1).  
The follow ing treatments will be administered:  
• Starting dose s of CBP -307 for titration (0.05 mg  on Day 1  followed by an up- titrated 
dose of  0.1 mg on Day  2) 
• A therapeuti c dose of CBP -307 (0.2 mg, Day s 3 to 6)  
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Day s 7 to 15)  
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and  CBP -307) 
• Moxifloxacin ( 400 mg)   
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study 
with an expected peak QT effect (placebo -corrected change- from -baseline QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec.  
An overview of the study design is shown in Figure  1. 
Figure  1: Study Schematic  
 
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with

prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day  -2 
and will remain at  the study site until discharge on Day  19. Treatment administration will 
occur on Days  1, 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 15, and 16 under fasting conditions  (all subjects will receive 
placebo on Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic ECG monitoring and recording will begin at 
least 25 hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day 1 and continue through 
24 hours after  the administration of study treatments  on Days  1, 6, 15, and 16 and at 
corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day - 1. Blood samples for PK 
analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint.  
Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours following dosing on Day 15. 
Subjects will return to the study site for a follow -up visit on Day 29±2  days. 
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 
25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on Day 1). Continuous 
cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Day s -1, 1, 6, 1 5, and 
16. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the  corresponding clock time on 
Day - 1. Replicate 12- lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to 
dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected at t he following timepoints: prior to dosing 
and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day ( Days  1, 6, 
15, and 16; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5  hour s postdose, 
±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes 
for 12 to 24 hours postdose ). Additional PK samples will be collected at 72 and 96 hours 
following dosing on Day 15 (sample collection window: ±30 minutes ). Subjects will be 
inactive and in a  supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each 
cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which will end immediately prior to the PK 
sampling. When timepoints for ECG extraction, safety ECGs, vital sign measurements, and 
blood draw s coincide, procedures will be performed in said order. At each timepoint, up to 
10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time window (the last 5 minutes of the 
15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine, quiet position). The EC G effects 
of CBP -307 will be tested on data from Day - 1 (baseline for both groups), Day 6 (therapeutic 
concentrations versus placebo) , and Day 15 (supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). 
Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be evaluat ed using ECG data collected on Days - 1, 
1, 15, and 16. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to 
treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, safety 1 2-lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at screening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow -up visit. In addition, subjects will be monitored via 
cardiac telemetry at specific timepoints during the treatment p eriod.  
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening  through follow -up 
visit) is anticipated to be approximately 59 days .

A Schedule of Assessments is presented in  Appendix 6. 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for CBP -307 to cause QT prolongation. 
As CBP -307 exposure affects heart rate, the primary endpoint for this study will be the QTcF.  
The study will be randomized and double -blind because randomization eliminates 
confounding by baseline va riables and blinding eliminates confounding by co- interve ntions, 
thus eliminating the possibility that the observed effects of the intervention are because of 
differential use of othe r treatments.  
The sample size for this study is based on a formal statistical power calculation . 
Conducting the study in healthy subjects mitigates the potential confounding effects of the 
disease state and concomitant medications.  Both male and female subjects will be included to 
eliminate similar known ECG variability effects.  
Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the  PK of CBP -307, subjects will be 
fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 4 hours postdose  on 
the days when PK samples are collected . 
Pharmacokinetic assessments of CBP -307 concentrations in plasma will be evaluated during 
the study. The timepoints for the PK sample collections are based on previous studies and are considered adequate to allow for the characterization of the drug’s PK after oral dosing. 
Furthermore, the chosen PK sample collection for CBP -307 is anticipate d to be sufficient to 
allow reasonable estimation of t
1/2 during the terminal elimination phase.  
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
According to ICH E14, the highest therapeutic dose and a supratherapeutic dose are recommended for the QT/QTc study. The CBP -307 doses of 0.2 and 0.5 mg were chosen for 
evaluation in this study based on observed PK results in completed Phase 1 studies. To 
carefully monitor safety following the administration of CBP -307 doses in  Group 1, CBP -307 
doses will be up -titrated as follow s: subjects will rece ive a s tarting dose of 0.05 mg CBP -307 
on Day 1 followed by an up- titrated dose of  0.1 mg on Day 2 and a dose of 0.2 mg on 
Days  3 to 6. Prior clinical experience with CBP -307 has not demonst rated clinically 
significant abnormalities in laboratory test results in the majority of subjects or a dose -
response r elationship for safety based on AEs . 
A single dose of 0.5 mg is the planned supratherapeutic dose, which balances the characteristics of the st udy design with the safety of healthy subject s. Testing of CBP -307 at 
substantial  multiples of the anticipated maximum therapeutic exposure is not clinically 
warranted due to the known safety and tolerability profile of CBP -307.

in this study. 
4.3. Subject Number and Identification 
Subjects  will have a unique identification number  used at  screening . Eligible s ubjects will be 
assigned a subject number prior to the  first dosing occasion. Assignment of  subject  numbers 
will be in ascending order and no numbers will be omitted (eg, Subjects  0101, 0102, 0103). 
The screening number will be used on all safety samples throughout the study. Replacement 
subjects ( Section  4.4) will be assigned a subject number corresponding to the number of the 
subject he/she is replacing plus 1000 (eg, Subject  1101 replaces Subject  0101). 
Subjects will be identified by screening  identification number or subject number only on all 
study documentation. A list identifying the subjects by subject number will be kept in the s ite 
master f ile. 
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
A subject is free to withdraw their informed consent from the study at any time  or they may 
be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or the sponsor for safety, 
behavioral, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol -required visits or 
procedures . In addition, a subject will be withdrawn  from dosing if any of the following 
criteria are met:  
• change in compliance with any inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant 
and affects subject safety  as determined by the investigator (or designee ) 
• noncompliance with the study restrictions that might affect subject safety or study 
assessments/objectives, as considered applicable by the investigator  (or designee)  
• any clinically relevant sign or symptom that , in the opinion of the investigator  (or 
designee) , warrants subject withdrawal . 
If a subject is withdrawn from dosing , the sponsor  will be notified and the date and reason(s) 
for the withdrawal will be documented in the subject ’s electronic c ase report f orm ( eCRF). If 
a subject is withdrawn  from the study , efforts will be made to perform all follow -up 
assessments, if possible ( Appendix 6).  Other procedures may be performed at  the 
investigator ’s (or designee’s)  and/or sponsor ’s discretion. If the subject is in -house, these 
procedures  should be performed before the subject is discharged from the clinic. The 
investigator  (or designee) may also request that the su bject return for an additional follow -up 
visit. All withdrawn subjects will be followed until resolution of all their AEs or until the 
unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator  (or designee) to have stabilized.  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.

following discussion between the investigator and the sponsor . Subjects withdrawn as a result 
of AEs thought to be related to the  study treatment will generally not be replaced . 
4.5. Study Termination  
The study may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator  (or designee) , sponsor , or 
sponsor ’s medical mo nitor if any of the following criteria are met:  
• investigator  decides to te rminate the study due to safety concerns such as AEs 
unknown to date (ie, not previously reported in any similar investigational study drug 
trial with respect to their nature, severity, and/or duration)  
• increased frequency , severity , and/or duration of known, anticipated, or previously 
reported AEs (this may also apply to AEs defined at check -in as baseline signs and 
symptoms)  
• medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued p erformance of the study  
• difficulties  in the recruitment o f subjects  
• cancelation of drug development  
• sponsor  requests for termination (eg, due to financial or management reasons, etc.) 
under the premise to fully protect the safety and rights of subjects  
• health  authority or ethics committee (EC) orders the termin ation of the trial for any 
reason .

• end-of-treatment is completion of safety follow -up or withdrawal from the study. 
End-of-study is the last visit by the last subject . 
5. STUDY TREATMENTS  
Study treatments are defined as any investigational product  (IP), non- investigational product 
(non- IP), placebo, or medical device intended to be administered to a study subject according 
to the study protocol.  
Note that in several countries, IP and non- IP are referred to as IMP and non- IMP, 
respectively.  
5.1. Investigational Products  
The details regarding the st orage, preparation, destruction, and administration of each 
treatment shown in Table 3 will be provided in a separate document. A pproximately 
64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 2 groups (Group 1

All supplies of the IMP, both bulk and subject -specific, will be stored in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s or pharmacy’s instructions. Until dispensed to the subjects, the study 
treatments will be stored at the study site in a location that is locked with restricted access.  
5.2. Study Treatment Administration  
Each dose of study treatment ( CBP -307, placebo, or moxifloxacin)  will be administered 
orally following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, with approximately 240 mL of room 
temperature water. Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP -307, 
subjects will be fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 
4 hours postdose  on the days when PK samples are collected . 
Subjects will be dosed in numerical order while sitting or standing but not be permitted to lie supine for 2 hours after treatment administration , except as necessitated by the occurrence of 
an AE(s) and/or study procedures.  
5.3. Randomization  
This is a double -blind  randomized study. Subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment 
sequences  before  administration of the first dose of study treatment. A randomization list will 
be generated by a statistician using a computer -generated pseudo- random permutation  
procedure . The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and 
on the enrollment eCRF. A computer -generated randomization schedule and emergency 
code -break envelopes will be provided to the study site. Randomization details will be 
included in the randomization specification.

Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 34 of 66  5.4. Blinding  
This is a double -blinded study. The following controls will be employed to maintain the 
double -blind status of the study:  
• The placebo will be identical in appearance to CBP -307 or moxif loxacin. 
• The investigator and other members of staff involved with the study will remain 
blinded to the treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure. 
• Interim bioanalytical data will be provided to Covance Early Clinical Biometrics  in a 
blinded manner.  
To maintain the blind, the investigator will be provided with a sealed randomization code for each subject, containing coded details of the treatment. These individual ly sealed envelopes 
will be kept in a limited access area that is accessible 24 h ours a day. If, in order to manage 
subject safety or to support dose escalation dec isions (in the event of possibly 
treatment- related SAEs or severe AEs), the decision to unblind resides solely with the 
investigator. Whenever possible, and providing it doe s not interfere with or delay any 
decision in the best interest of the subject, the investigator will discuss the intended code -break with the sponsor. If it becomes necessary to break the code during the study, the 
date, time, and reason will be recorded in the subject's source data and on the individual envelope and will be witnessed by a second person. 
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance:  
• All doses will be administered under the supervision of suitably qualified study site 
staff. 
• Immediately after dose administration, visual inspection of the mouth and hands will 
be performed for each subject.  
• At each dosing occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of IMP will be performed.    
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The investigator  (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of study 
treatments (CBP -307, moxifloxacin, placebo -matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched 
moxifloxacin)  received. In addition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, 
specifying the amount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensing. This drug 
accountability record will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the 
study, the original drug accountability record will be available for review by the sponsor  
upon request. 
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarded upon 
satisfactory completion of the compliance and accountability procedures. Any unuse d 
assembled unit doses will be retained until the completion of the study.

placebo -matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched moxifloxacin) will be disposed of by the 
study site ’s pharmacy ( RAH Pharmacy) , per the sponsor ’s written instructions.  If destruction 
is authorized to take place at the study site ’s pharmacy, the investigator must ensure that the 
materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations and 
institutional policy. All study drug destructions must be adequately documented.  
6. CONCOMITANT THERAPIES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS  
6.1. Concomitant Therapies 
Subjects will refrain from the use of any prescription  or nonprescription medication s/products  
during the study until the follow -up visit, unless the investigator  (or designee)  and/or sponsor  
have given their prior consent. Medications taken within 28 days before study treatment 
administration will be documented as a prior treatment. Treatments taken after study 
treatment administration will be documented as concomitant treatments.  
Paracetamol /acetaminophen  (2 g/day for up to 3 consecutive days) is an  acceptable 
concomitant medication. The administration of any other concomitant medications during the 
study is prohibited without prior approval of the investigator  (or designee) , unless its use is 
deemed necessary for the treatment of an AE . Any medication taken by a subject during the 
course of the study and the reason for its use will be documented in the source data.   
Females will refrain from the use of  hormone replacement therapy and oral, implantable, 
transdermal, injectable , or intrauterine  hormonal contraceptives (with the excepti on of 
Mirena®) during the study until the follow -up visit (See Appendix 4) . 
6.2. Diet 
While confined at the study site, subjects will receive a standardized diet at scheduled times 
that do not conflict with other study- related activities. Subjects will be  fasted overnight (at 
least 10 hours ) before the collection of blood sample s for clinical laboratory evaluations . 
On the days with PK assessments ( Appendix 6), the subjects will be fasted  overnight ( at least  
10 hours ) prior to dosing and refrain from consuming water from 1 hour predose until  1 hour  
postdose, excluding the amount of water consumed at dosing. Food is allowed from 4 hours 
postdose. At all other times during the study, subjects may consume water ad libitum. 
Foods and beverages containing poppy seeds , grapefruit , or Seville oranges will not be 
allowed from 7  days prior to check -in until follow -up visit on Day 29±2 days . 
Consumption of c affeine /xanthine -containing foods and beverages will not be allowed from  
48 hours  before check -in until d ischarge on Day 19. 
Consumption of alcohol will not be permitted from 72 hours  prior to check -in until discharge 
on Day 19 and alcohol intake will be limited to a maximum of 2 units/day on all other days, 
whilst not at the study site, from screening to 72 hours prior to the follow -up visit  on 
Day 29±2 days .

Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 36 of 66  6.3. Smoking  
Subjects will not be permitted to  use tobacco - or nicotine -containing products  within 
3 months prior to check -in until the follow -up visit.  
6.4. Exercise  
Subjects are required to refrain from strenuous exercise from  7 days  before check -in until the 
follow -up visit (Day 29 ±2 days ) and will otherwise maintain their normal level of physical 
activity during this time (ie, will not begin a new exercise program nor participate in any 
unusually strenuous physical exertion). 
6.5. Blood Donation  
Subjects are required to refrain from donation of blood from 3 months prior to screening, 
plasma from 2 weeks prior to screening, and platelets from 6 weeks prior to screening until 3 months after the follow -up visit.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures as closely as possible to the nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, and the other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. 
The highest priority procedures will be perf ormed closest to the nominal time. The order of 
priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority):  
• dosing  
• continuous ECG extraction window  
• pharmacokinetic blood samples 
• safety assessments  
• any other procedures . 
This study includes a screening period (Day - 28 to Day - 3), a treatment period (Days -2 to 
19), and a follow -up period (Day 29 ±2 days ).  
The defined abnormal vital sign measurements (Exclusion Criteria #4) at check- in (Day -2) 
or baseline (Day -1 predose) will only be considered exclusionary if judged applicable by the 
investigator. For confirmation of enrollment eligibility based on pulse rate , the pulse rate 
assessed by vital signs, rather than the 12 -lead ECG, will be used. For all subjects, the 
screening, check -in, or baseline blood pressure, pulse rate , and respiratory rate may be 
repeated after 5 to 10 minutes if the initial reading is  believed to be atypical for the subject.

7.1.1. Demographics 
Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order 
to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.  
7.1.2. Medical History  
At the timepoint specified in Appendix 6, the i nvestigator or designee will collect a complete 
medical and surgical history. Medical his tory will include information on the subject’s 
concurrent medical conditions and any events occurring prior to the first dose of study treatment. All findings will be recorded on the medical history eCRF.  
7.2. Electrocardiography Assessments  
7.2.1. Continuous 12 -lead Electrocardiogram Recording  
Continuous 12- lead digital ECG recording will be performed as specified in Appendix 6. All 
ECG data will be collected using a Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG continuous 12- lead 
digital recorder. The 12- lead Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG equipment will be supplied 
and supported by ERT (eResearch  Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA). The continuous 
12-lead digital ECG data will be stored onto SD memory cards.  
The ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected by pred etermined timepoints as defined 
in Appendix 6 and will be read centrally by ERT (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA). The following principles will be followed in ERT’s core laboratory:  
• ECG analysts are blinded to the subject, visit, and treatment allocation.  
• Baseline and on -treatment ECGs for a particular subject will be over- read on the same 
lead and will be analyzed by the same reader. 
The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analyzable, then the primary lead of analysis will be changed to another lead for the entire subject data set.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be extracted in up to 10 replicates at the predefined timepoints and 
subjects will be inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each nominal time.

Ten 14-second digital 12- lead ECG tracings will be extracted from the continuous Holter (or 
Mortara Surveyor) recordings using the ‘TQT Plus method’, a computer- assisted and 
statistical process utilized by ERT . The method enables extraction of ECGs with the lowest 
HR variability and noise within the protocol- specified extraction time window (eg , the HR 
and QT changes from beat -to-beat in the range of <10%). At each protocol- specified 
timepoint, 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute “ECG window” (typically,

position ). 
7.2.1.2.  Expert  Precision QT Analysis  
Expe rt precision QT analysis will be performed on all analyzable (non -artifact) beats in the 
10 ECG replicates. Statistical quality control procedures  are used to review and assess all 
beats and identify “high” and “low” confidence beats using several criteria, including: 
•QT or QTc values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely).
•RR values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely).
•Rapid changes in QT, QTc, or RR from beat- to-beat.
Measurements of all primary ECG parameters (QT, QTc, RR) in all recorded beats of all replicates that are deemed “high confidence” will be performed using COMPAS software. All low -confidence beats will be reviewed manually and adjudicated using pass- fail criteria. 
The final QC assessment will b e performed by a cardiologist. The beats found acceptable by 
manual review will be included in the analysis. The median QT, QTc, and RR values from each extracted replicate will be calculated, and then the mean of all available medians from a nominal timepoint will be used as the subject’s reportable value at that timepoint.  
Categorical T -wave morphology analysis and the measurement of PR and QR S interval of the 
ECG (QRS) intervals will be performed manually in 3 of the 10 ECG replicates at each timepoint. Each fiducial point (onset of P -wave, onset of Q- wave, offset of S -wave, and 
offset of T -wave) will be electronically marked.  
For T-wave morphology and U- wave presence, treatment -emergent changes will be assessed 
(ie, changes not present at baseline). For each category of T-wave morphology and U- waves, 
the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate at the timepoint. For baseline, the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate from all timepoints that constitute baseline.  
7.2.2. Safety 12-lead Electrocardiogram 
Resting 12-lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine an d at rest for at 
least 5 minutes at the times in dicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6.  Single 
12-lead ECGs will be repeated  twice, and an average taken of the 3 readings,  if either of the  
following criteria applies:
•QT
 interval corrected for HR using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) is >500 ms
•QTcF change from the basel ine (predose) is >60  ms.
Additional 12- lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinically 
appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of ECGs is required. The investigator (or designee) will perfor m a clinical assessment of each 12 -lead 
ECG.

Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 39 of 66  7.2.3. Cardiac Telemetry Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored via cardiac telemetry  from approximately 1 hour  prior to dose 
administration and until approximately 12 hours postdose on Days 1, 2, 3, and 7 (up- titration 
days; as described in Appendix 6) . Based on the emerging safety data from the study, the 
duration of the telemetry may be extended if nece ssary.  
The start and stop date and time of the telemetry monitoring will be recorded in the eCRFs. 
Clinically significant abnormalities noted from telemetry monitoring will be confirmed by 
12-lead ECG  if ne cessary , then after confirming, the abnormities wi ll be reported as AEs in 
the e CRF.  
7.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.3.1. Pharmacokinetic  Blood Sample Collection and Processing  
Blood samples ( approximately 1 ×  3 mL for CBP -307 and moxifloxacin assays) will be 
collected by veni puncture or cannulation at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments  in Appendix 6. Procedures for collection, processing, and shipping of PK bl ood 
samples will be detailed in a separate document .  
7.3.2. Analytical Methodology 
Plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and moxifloxacin will be determined using a validated 
analytical procedure. Spe cifics of the analytical method  will be provided in a separate 
document.   
7.4. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
7.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions, assignment of severity and causality, and procedures for reporting 
SAEs are detailed in  Appendix 1.  
The condition of each subject will be monitored from the time of signing the ICF until the follow -up visit . Subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their 
condition by open questioning, such as “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”, at least once each day while resident at the study site and each study visit. Subjects will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during the study.  
All nonserious AEs, whether reported by the subject voluntarily or upon questioning,  or 
noted on physical examination, will be recorded from initiation of placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) until study completion. I f AEs that occur in the screening prior to 
placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) are considered to be related to the study 
procedure, they should be also collected. Serious AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the ICF until study completion.  The nature, time of onset, dura tion, and severity 
will be documented, together with an investigator ’s (or designee’s) opinion of the 
relationship to study treatment.

to resolution or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator  (or designee) to have 
stabilized . This will be completed at the investigator’s (or designee’s ) discretion.  
7.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evalu ations  at the times 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Clinical laboratory evaluations are 
listed in Appendix 2.  
A serum qualitative pregnancy or urine test (females only) and follicle -stimulating hormone  
test (postmenopausal females only) will be performed at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix 6. A positive urine pregnancy test will  be confirmed with  a serum pregnancy test.  
All pregnancies should be reported as specified in Appendix  1. 
Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed a t other times if judged to be 
clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of clinical laboratory safety evaluations is required. At the discretion of the investigator, clinically significant clinical labo ratory assessments may be confirmed by repeat 
sampling. If the clinical significance is confirmed, subjects will be excluded from 
participation or, if already included, will be followed until normalization of the test result or for as long as the investiga tor considers necessary.  
Subjects will be asked to provide urine samples for drugs of abuse screen  and cotinine test , 
and will undergo an alcohol breath test  at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
in Appendix  6. For all female subjects, a pregnancy test will be performed at the times 
indicated i n the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6.   
An investigator ( or designee)  will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical laboratory data.  
7.4.3. Vital Signs  
Supine  blood pressure, supine pulse rate , respiratory rate, and tympanic temperature will be 
assessed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Vital signs 
may also be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing 
review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of vital signs is required.  
All measurements will be performed singly . For all subjects, the screening, check -in, or 
baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate may be repeated after 5 to 10 minutes 
if the initial reading is believed to be atypical for the subject.  
Subjects must be supine  for at least 5  minutes before blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements.

gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, skin,  and other s. 
Height, weight, and body mass index  will be assessed at screening.  
8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (a t least  30% for each sex ) will be randomized into 
2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects.  
Sample S ize for P rimary A nalysis:  
A sample size of 28 evaluable subjects per treatment group will provide more than 9 4.4% 
power to exclude that CBP -307 causes more than 10- msec QTc effect at clinically relevant 
plasma levels, as shown by the upper bound of the 2- sided 90% confidence interva l (CI) of 
the model -predicted QT effect (ΔΔ QTcF) at the observed geometric mean C max of CBP -307 
in the study. This power is estimated approximately using a 2 -sample t -test. The calculation 
assumes a 1- sided 5% significance level, a n underlying effect of CB P-307 of 3 msec and a 
standard deviation (SD) of the ΔQTcF of 8 msec for both CBP -307 and placebo treatment 
groups . Note that this calculation is conservative, since it does not take into account any gain 
in precision due to the use of all data of each sub ject with the help of a linear mixed -effects 
model. The concentration- QTc analysis method is supported by Darpo et al 20153 and 
Ferber  et al, 2015,4 and consistent with the experiences from 25 recent TQT studies.  
Sample Size Considerations for Assay Sensitivity : 
To demonstrate assay  sensitivity with concentration- QTc analysis, it has to be shown that the 
ΔΔQTcF of a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin exceeds 5 msec (ie, the lower bound of the 
2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc effect [ΔΔQTcF] should exceed 5 msec). In a similarly 
designed, recent crossover study with 24 healthy subjects  (on-file data , ERT) , the standard 
error (SE) for the prediction of the QT effect of moxifloxacin based on the exposure -response 
analysis was 1.24 msec. The within -subject SD of ΔQTcF in the referred study was 5.4 msec  
based on the by- timepoint analysis. If the effect of moxifloxacin is assumed to be 10  msec, 
the SE of 1.24 msec corresponds to an effect size of (10- 5)/(1.24×sqrt[24])=0.82, where the 
effect size is the effect assumed under the alternative hypothesis divided by the SD of the test variable. This value should be compared to the effect size of 0. 64 required to guarantee a 
power of at least 95% in a paired  t-test situation with a sample size of 28  evaluable subjects. 
In other words, based on this calculation, a power of at least 9 5% will be obtained as long as 
the variability of the ΔQTcF, as measured by its within -subject SD  from the by- timepoint 
analysis , does not exceed 6.9 msec (ie, 1 28% [= 0.82/0.64] o f the 5.4 msec observed in t he 
referred study  assuming the ratio of effective sizes is consistent with inverse ratio of 
within -subject SD ). The number also agrees with recent recommendations of the FDA, which 
propose at least 20 subjects .

Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 42 of 66  8.2. Analysis Populations  
8.2.1. Cardiodynamic Population  
The QT/QTc population will include all subjects in the safety population with measurements 
at baseline as well as on -treatment with at least 1 postdose timepoint with a valid ΔQTcF 
value. The QT/QTc populati on will be used for the by- timepoint and categorical analyses of 
the cardiodynamic ECG parameters.  
The PK/QTc population will include all subjects who are in both the QT/QTc and PK 
populations wit h at least 1 pair of postdose PK and ∆ QTcF data from the same timepoint as 
well as subjects in the QT/QTc population who received placebo. The PK/QTc population 
will be used for the concentration -QTc analysis and assay sensitivity. PK/QTc population 
will b e defined for CBP -307, and for moxifloxacin.  
The as- treated principle will be applied to all analysis populations mentioned below. 
8.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product  and have evaluable PK data  of any of the analytes (CBP -307 and moxifloxacin) . A 
subject will be excluded from the PK summary statistics and statistical analysis if the  subject 
has an AE of vomiting that occurs at or before 2 times median time to maximum  
concentration.  
8.2.3. Safety Population  
The safety population will include all  subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product drug (therapeutic and supra therapeutic doses of CBP -307, moxifloxacin, or  placebo) . 
8.3. Cardiodynamic ECG Analyses  
Baseline  for Cardiodynamic ECG Assessments  
Baseline for the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 ( CBP -307 in Group 1 versus 
placebo  in Groups 2A and 2B ) will be time -matched values on Day - 1.  
For assay sensitivity  in Groups 2A and 2B , the following baselines will be used:  
• Group 2A: For moxifloxacin administered  on Day 1, baseline will be Day 16, on 
which subjects are administer ed placebo. For placebo- correction in this group, 
placebo values will be derived from Day 15 on which subjects are administered 
placebo, and baseline will be obtained on Day - 1. 
• Group 2B: For moxifloxacin administere d on Day 16, baseline will be Day 1, on 
which subjects are administered  placebo. For the placebo -correction in this group, 
Day - 1 values will be used as placebo (no treatment) and  baseline will be obtained on 
Day 15.

Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 43 of 66  Concentration- QTc Analysis  (Primary Analysis)  
The relationship between CBP -307 plasma concentrations and change -from -baseline QTcF 
(∆QTcF) will be quantified using a li near mixed -effects modeling approach with ΔQTcF as 
the dependent variable, time -matched concentrations of CBP -307 as  the exploratory variate  
(0 for placebo), treatment (act ive=1 or placebo=0) , and time (ie , postbaseline timepoints on 
Days 1, 6, and 15 categorical ) as fixed effects , and a random intercept and slope per subject.6  
The degrees of freedom estimates will be determined by the Kenward -Roge r method. From 
the model, the slope (ie , the regression parameter for the CBP -307 concentration) and the 
treatment effect -specific intercept will be estimated together with 2 -sided 90% CI . The 
estimates for the time effect will be reported with degrees of freedom and SE.  
For the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 versus placebo, the time term incorporated 
into the models (both by -time point analysis and concentration -QTc analysis [or assay 
sensit ivity]) includes the single pre dose timepoint and all po stdose time points on Days 1, 6, 
and 15, and Days 1 and 16 for active versus placebo and moxifloxacin versus placebo, 
respectively. All times are relative to the time of dosing on that day which is considered the first dose for the assay sensitivity analysis. For the analysis of CBP -307 versus placebo , the 
first dose of study treatment is on Day 1. 
The geometric mean of the individual C
max values for CBP -307 concentrations for subjects in 
the active drug groups on each of Days 6 and 15 will be determined, respectively. The predicted effect and its 2 -sided 90% CI for placebo- corrected change- from- baseline QTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) (ie , slope estimate × concentration + treatment effect -specific intercept) at this 
geometric mean C
max will be obtained.  
To eval uate the adequacy of model fit with respect to the assumption of linearity, the 
observed ΔQTcF values adjusted by population time effect estimated from the model will be used. These individual placebo- adjusted ΔQTcF
i,k (ΔΔQTcF i,k) values equal the observed 
individual ΔQTcF i,k for subject i administered with active drug or placebo at timepoint k 
minus the estimated population mean pl acebo effect at timepoint k (ie, time effect). A decile 
plot, i e, plot of the deciles of observed concentrations and the mean p lacebo -adjusted ΔQTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) and 90% CI at the median concentration within each decile will be given. The regression line presenting the model -predicted ΔΔQTcF
7 will be added to evaluate the fit of a 
linear model and visualize the concentration -response relationship. The placebo- adjusted 
ΔQTcF i,j equals the individual ΔQTcF i,j for subject i administered with CBP -307 at timepoint 
j minus the estima tion of time at timepoint j (ie , time effect). Additional exploratory analyses 
(via graphical displays and/or model fitting) will include accounting for a delayed effect 
(hysteresis) and the justification for the choice of PD  model (linear versus nonlinear) a s 
follows.  
Criteria for N egative QT A ssessment  
If the upper bound of the 2- sided 90%  CI of the  predicted QTc effect of ΔΔQTcF at the 
observed geometric mean Cmax on Days  6 and 15  as well as clinically relevant plasma leve ls 
is below 10 msec (ie,  the upper bound of the 2- sided 90% CI at the geometric mean C max 
Protocol Amendment 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 44 of 66  <10 msec), it can be concluded that CBP -307 does not cause clinically concerning QT 
prolongation within the observed plasma concentration ranges.  
Investigation of H ysteresis  
Hysteresis will be assessed based on joint graphical displays of the least squares (LS) mean 
ΔΔQTcF for each postbaseline timepoint and the mean concentration of CBP -307 at the same 
timepoints. In addition, hysteresis plots will be given for LS mean ΔΔQTcF and the mean 
concentrat ions. If a QT effect (ΔΔQTcF) > 10 msec cannot be excluded from the by -timepoint 
analysis in the active dose groups on Days 6 and 15; and the mean peak ΔΔQTcF effe ct is 
observed at the same timepoint in the by- timepoint analysis in the active dose groups on 
Days  6 and 15; and if the difference (delay ) between the time to reach the  peak QT c effect 
(ΔΔQTcF) and peak plasma concentration (t max) in the plot (ΔΔQTcF versus CBP -307) of 
more than 1 hour is observed in a consisten t way for the active d ose groups on Days 6 and 15, 
other concentration -QTc models, such as a model with an effect compartment, may be 
explored. With the provision stated above, hysteresis will be assumed if this curve shows a counterclockwise loop. A significant treatment effec t-specific intercept may also be 
indicative of hysteresis  or model misspecification , if it cannot be explained by a nonlinear 
relationship.  
Appropriateness of a L inear M odel 
To assess the appropriateness of a linear model, normal quantile -quantile  plots fo r the 
standardized residuals and the random effects, scatter  plots of standardized residuals versus 
concentration and versus fitted values , and box plots of standardized residuals versus nominal 
time and versus active treatment will be produced. The scatte r plot of standardized residuals 
versus conc entration by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing  (LOESS)  fitting (ie , locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing
8 lines ) also will be produced with an optimal smoothing 
parameter selected by the Akaike information criterion with a correction.9 In addition, a 
scatter plot of observed concentration and ΔQTcF with a LOESS smooth line with 90% CI and a linear regression line will also be provided to check the assumption of a linear concentration -QTc relati onship. If there is an indication that a linear model is inappropriate, 
additional models may be fitted, such as an E -max model . The concentration- QTc analysis 
will then be repeated for the model found to best accommodate the nonlinearity detected.  
Assay S ensitivity  
Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by similar concentration -QTc analysis of 
moxifloxacin data. If the slope of the concentration- QTc (change -from- baseline QTcF) for 
moxifloxacin is statistically significant at 10% level for 2 -sided test and the lower bound of 
the 2- sided 90% CI of the predicted effect is above 5 msec at the observed geometric mean 
C
max of the 400- mg dose, assay sensitivity will be deemed to have been demonstrated.  
By-Time point Analysis  
The analysis for QTcF for CBP -307 versus placebo will be based on a linear mixed -effects 
model with change -from -baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) as the dependent variable, time (ie , 
postbaseline timepoint s on Days 1, 6, and 15: categorical), treatment (therapeutic dose of 
CBP -307 and supra therapeutic dose of CBP -307 on Day 15, and corresponding placebo), and

specified fo r the repeated measures at post dose timepoints within subjec ts. If the model with 
unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices such as 
compound symmetry and autoregressive will be considered. From this analysis, the LS  mean , 
SE, and 2- sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the contrast “CBP -307 versus placebo” for 
each day of Days 1, 6, and 15 at each postbaseline timepoint on Days 1, 6, and Day 15, 
respectively . 
The by- time point analysis for QTc F will be also performed for moxifloxacin versus placebo 
at post baseline timepoints on Day 1 and Day 16. A linear mixed -effects model will be used 
with ΔQTcF as the dependent variable and time (ie, postbaseline timepoint s on Days 1 and 
16: categorical), treatment (moxifloxacin and placebo), sequence (placebo/moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin/placebo), and time -by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be specified fo r the repeated measures at postbaseline time points for 
subject within visit. The model will also include a subject- specific random effect. If the 
model with an unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices, 
such as compound symmetry or autoregressive, will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean , SE,  and 2- sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the contrast “moxifloxa cin versus 
placebo” at each postbaseline tim epoint , respectively . 
For HR, PR, and QRS intervals, the analysis will be based on the change -from -baseline 
postdose (ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS). The same (by -timepoint analysis) model will be used as 
described for QTcF. The LS mean, SE, and 90% CI from the statistical modeling for both change -from -baseline and placebo -corrected change -from- baseline values will be listed in the 
tables and graphically displayed.  
Categorical Analyses  
The analysis results for categorical outliers, T -wave morphology, and U -wave presence will 
be summarized in frequency tables with counts (percentages) for both the number of subjects and the number of timepoints. For categorical outliers, the number (percenta ge) of subjects as 
well as time points who had increases  in absolute QTcF values > 450 and ≤480 msec, >480 
and ≤500 msec, or >500 msec, and changes from pre dose base line of >30 and ≤60 msec, or 
>60 msec; increase in PR from pre dose baseline >25% to a PR  > 200 msec; increase in QR S 
from pre dose baseline > 25% to a QRS > 120 msec; decrease in HR from pr edose baseline 
>25% to a n HR < 50 bpm; and increase in HR from pr edose baseline >25% to a n HR 
>100 bpm will be determined. For T -wave morphology and U -wave presence, the analyses 
will be  focused on change fr om baseline (ie , treatment- emergent changes).  
8.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mean, SD , median, minimum, 
maximum  geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation ) separately by group. 
Individual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time data will 
be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data may be provided as well.

Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 46 of 66  For each subject, the following PK parameters will be calculated, wh enever possible, based 
on the plasma concentration for CBP -307 and moxifloxacin, according to the model 
independent approach:  
• Cmax

Cmax/Day 7 C max and Day 15 AUC 0-24/Day 7 AUC 0-24, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed, if appropriate, using commercial software 
such as Phoenix® WinNonlin® (Version 8.1 or higher).  
Other parameter s may be added as appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as recorded on the eCRF. Other data handling 
procedures will be detaile d in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
8.5. Safety Analysis  
All AEs will be listed and treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized using the descriptive 
methodology. Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Observed values for cl inical laboratory test data, 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, and physical 
examination findings will be listed.

Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 49 of 66  Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subjec t or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including a  clinically significant  abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not related to the study 
treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that had increased 
in severity or frequency since the administration of study medication.  
Examples of AEs include:  
• Symptoms described by the subject, or signs observed by the investigator, and 
• Abnormal findings (involving clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, ECG, etc.)  
• Exacerbation of previous condition, including increased incidence and/or severity.  
Note: Regarding decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood in this study, please report them as follows:  
• Since a decreased lymph ocyte count in peripheral blood is due to the mechanism of 
action of the drug, it  is not to be reported as an AE. However, clinical diagnosis 
related to a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood indicates AE reporting (if no diagnosis is available, it is required to report related clinical symptoms or signs).  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs. All AEs will be recorded in the medical records and eCRFs. The investigator (or designee) is to record in 
detail any AE that occurred to the subject, including: AE diagnosis whenever possible, or signs , symptoms, the start date and time of occurrence, the stop date and tim e of occurrence, 
seriousness (ie, whether it is a n SAE), severity of AEs, causality assessment, actions taken on 
the investigational product, other actions (eg, medications/treatments given), and outcomes of AEs.  
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator  will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE  using the 
following categories:  
• Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living.  
• Moderate : Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Protocol Amendment 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 50 of 66  • Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly  affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . 
Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator  (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study treatment  using a 4-category system according to the following guidelines:  
• Not Related : The AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study 
procedure/conditions . 
• Unlikely Related : The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that 
the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE . 
• Possibly Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the 
study procedures/conditions . 
• Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of 
the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause- effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when t he drug is reintroduced.  
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Every reasonable effort will be made to follow  up with subjects who have AEs. Any subject 
who has an ongoing AE  that is  possibly related or related to the  IMP  or study procedures at 
the follow -up visit will be followed up, where possible, until resolution or until the 
unresolved AE is judged by the investigator (or designee) to have stabilized . This will be 
completed at the investigator ’s (or designee’s) discretion.  Any subject who has an ongoing 
AE that is not related or unlikely related to the IMP or study procedures at the follow -up visit  
can be closed out as ongoing at the investigator ’s discretion.   
Adverse Drug Reactions 
All noxious and unintended responses to an IMP ( ie, where a causal relati onship between an 
IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered 
adverse drug reactions.  
For marketed medicinal products, a response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and 
which  occurs at doses normally u sed in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases 
or modification of physiological function is to be considered an adverse drug reaction. 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, I B for an unapproved 
IMP).  
Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs will be collected after subjects sign the informed consent form and  throughout the 
entire study, ie , until the e nd-of-study as specified in the protocol (or at early termination).  
Protocol Amendment 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 51 of 66  An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose either:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in  persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• results in an important medical event (see below) . 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Instances of death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the investigator  at 
any time after cessation of the study treatment and considered by the investigator  to be 
possibly relat ed to the study treatment, will be reported to the sponsor  (or designee) . 
Definition of Life -threatening  
An AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred (ie, does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). For instance, drug -induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of 
hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis 
can be fatal.  
Definition of Hospitalization  
Adverse events requiring hospitalization should be considered serious. In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate at the  study site . When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or 
was necessary, the AE should be considered as serious.  
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures, which are not the r esult of 
an AE, need not be considered A Es and should be recorded on a clinical assessment f orm and 
added to the e CRF . If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, this must be 
reported as an AE and either ‘serious’ or ‘nonserious’ attributed acc ording to the usual 
criteria.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator  will complete an SAE report form and forward it by facsimile  or email  to 
Covance APAC Drug Safety  and the sponsor  immediately (within 24  hours) upon becoming 
aware of an SAE.  
Protocol Amendment 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 52 of 66  All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) to: +61 -2-8879-2000  
SAE Reporting email: SAEIntake@covance.com (preferred method)  
Covance Safety SAE Reporting Fax Number:  61-2-6100- 9788 or 1800-882- 203 (toll free)  
 
The responsibilities of Covance APAC Drug Safety  include the following:  
• Prepare an AE reporting plan prior to the start of the study. Where this plan differs 
from the applicable study site  standard operating procedure on SAE reporting, the 
safety management p lan will always take precedence.  
• Receive and review SAE report forms from the study site  and inform the sponsor  of 
the SAE within 1 working day of the initial notification to Covance AP AC Drug 
Safety  who will delete any information from the SAE report forms that may identify 
the subject.  
• Write case narratives and enter the case into Covance’s safety database as defined in 
the AE reporting plan . 
• Produce appropriate reports of all suspected unexpected serious adverse r eactions and 
forward them to the EC , Medicines and Healthca re Products Regulatory Agency, 
principal investigator, and the sponsor  within the timeframes stipulated in the Clinical 
Trials Directive Guideline (ENTR/CT  3).  
The responsibility for reporting SAEs will be transferred to the sponsor  28 days after the end 
of the study.  
For SAEs, the active reporting period to sponsor or its designated representative begins from the time that the subject provides informed consent through to the last subject  visit.  
Nonserious  AEs should be collected from the time the subject  has taken the placebo dose on 
Day - 1 through the last subject  visit. If AEs that occur in the screening prior to the placebo 
administration to all subjects on Day - 1 are considered to be related to the study procedure, 
they should be also collected.  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, the 
sponsor should be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event. This time frame also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded SAE 
reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a n SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his or her first awareness of the AE.  
Protocol Amendment 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 53 of 66  For all SAE s, the inves tigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the sponsor in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting as specified above. In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by the sponsor to obtain specific additional follow -up information in a n 
expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on 
the AE e CRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow 
for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible 
causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the sponsor or its designated representative.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy (maternal or paternal exposure to study treatment) does not meet the definition of 
an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported 
following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus.  
If the female subject becomes pregnant during the clinical trial and has not yet been dosed with study treatment, she must be withdrawn from the study. If the female subject becomes 
pregnant during the clinical trial and has been dosed, she must discontinue treatment 
immediately  but may remain on study for safety evaluations . If the partner of a male subject 
becomes pregnant during the clinical trial, the subjec t can continue the clinical trial.  
For pregnancy of female subjects or partners of the male subjects during this study, investigators should report to the sponsor or designee in a pregnancy report form within 24 hours after investigator awareness and repo rt to the EC in time as per local requirement.  
The investigator will follow up on pregnancy outcomes, until not less than 12 months  after 
birth, unless otherwise justified , and will report the outcome to the s ponsor and e thics 
committee.  
If any adverse p regnancy outcome (eg, the outcome of the  pregnancy is stillbirth, 
spontaneous abortion, or fetal malformations ), it should be considered as an SAE and be 
reported in accordance with SAE reporting requirements.

Definitions  
Women of Childbearing Potential: premenopausal females who are anatomically and 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant following menarche.  
Women of Non childbearing  Potential:  
1. Surgically sterile:  females who are permanently sterile via hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy , and/or bilateral oophorectomy by reported medical 
history and/or medical records. Surgical sterilization to have occurred a minimum of 6 weeks , or at the investigator ’s discret ion, prior to screening . 
2. Postmenopausal: f emales at least 45 years of age with amenorrhea for 12 months 
without an alternative medical reason with confirmatory follicle -stimulating 
hormone (FSH) levels of ≥40 mIU/mL. The amenorrhea should not be induced by 
a medical condition such as anorexia nervosa, hypothyroid disease or polycystic 
ovarian disease, or by extreme exercise. It should not be due to concomitant medications that may have induced the amenorrhea such as oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotrop in-releasing hormones, anti -estrogens, or selective estrogen 
receptor modulators. Females on hormone replacement therapy with FSH levels <40 mIU/mL may be included at the discretion of the investigator.   
Fertile male: a male that is considered fertile after puberty.  
Infertile male: permanently sterile male via bilateral orchiectomy.  
Contraception Guidance  
Female Subjects  
Female subjects who are of nonchildbearing potential will not be required to use contraception. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods (1 primary and 1 secondary method) of birth control from the time of signing the ICF  until 
90 days after the follow -up visit. Primary (non -barrier) methods of contraception include:  
• surgical method performed at least 3 months prior to the screening  visit:  
o bilateral tubal ligation  or bilateral salpingectomy  
o Essure
® (hysteroscopic bilateral tubal occlusion) with confirmation of 
occlusion of the fallopian tubes  
• non-hormonal intrauterine device  or Mirena® (other hormonal intrauterine devices 
will not be allowed) in place for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of the study 
drug 
• vasectomized male partner (sterilization performed at least 90 days  prior to the 
screening  visit, with verbal confirmation of surgical success, and the sole partner for 
the female subject)  
Protocol Amendment 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 57 of 66  Secondary (barrier) methods of contraception include:  
• male condom with out spermicide  
• female condom with out spermicide  
• cervical cap with out spermicide (as prescribed ) 
• diaphragm with out spermicide (as prescribed ). 
Female subjects of childbearing potential should refrain from donation of ova from check -in 
(Day -2) until 90 days after the follow -up visit.  
Male Subjects  
Male subjects (even with  a history of vasectomy) with partners of childbearing potential must 
use a male barrier method of contraception (ie, male condom with out spermicide) in addition 
to a second method of acceptable contraception from check -in until 90 days after the 
follow -up visit. Acceptable methods of contraception for female partners include:  
• hormonal injection  
• combined oral contraceptive pill  or progestin/progestogen- only pill  
• combined hormonal patch 
• combined hormonal vaginal ring  
• surgical method (bilateral tubal ligation  or Essure® [hysteroscopic bilateral tubal 
occlusion])  
• hormonal implant  
• hormonal or non- hormonal intrauterine device  
• cervical cap with out spermicide  
• diaphragm with out spermicide . 
An acceptable second method of contraception for male subjects is vasectomy that has been 
performed at least 90 days prior to the screening visit with verbal confirmation of surgical 
success.  
For male subjects (even with a history of vasectomy), sexual intercourse with female partners 
who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be avoided unless condoms are used from the time 
of the first dose until 90  days after the follow -up visit. Male subjects are required to refrain 
from donation of sperm from check -in until 90 days after the follow -up visit.  
Sexual Abstinence and Same -sex Relationships  
Subjects who practice true abstinence, because of the subject’s lifestyle choice (ie, the subject 
should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation), are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a

agree to use contraception as described  previously.  
For subjects who are exclusively in same -sex relationships, contraceptive requirements do not 
apply. If a subject who is in a same -sex relationship at the time of signing the ICF becomes 
engaged in a heterosexual relationship, they must agree  to use contraception as described 
previously.

submitted to the human research e thics committee  (HREC) by the investigator  and reviewed 
and approved by the HREC before the study is initiated.  
Any protocol amendments will require EC approval before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents from the  
HREC. All correspondence with HREC should be retained in the investigator file. A copy of HREC approval should be forwarded to the sponsor.  
• The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
• Providing wr itten summaries of the status of the study to the EC annually or more 
frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the EC.  
• Notifying the EC of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by EC procedure s.  
• Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of ICH guidelines, the EC, and all other applicable local regulations.  
Regulatory Authority  
The sponsor will obtain approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory agency 
in accordance with any applicable country- specific regulatory requirements before the study 
is initiated at a study center in that country.

Prior to starting participation in the study, each subject will be provided with a study -specific 
ICF giving details of the study treatment s, procedures, and potential risks of the study. 
Subjects will be instructed that they ar e free to obtain further information from the 
investigator  (or designee) and that their participation is voluntary and they are free to 
withdraw from the study at any time.  Subjects will be given an opportunity to ask questions 
about the study prior to providing consent for participation.  
Following the discussion of the study with study site  personnel, subjects will sign the ICF in 
the presence of a suitably trained member of staff to indicate that they are freely giving their 
informed consent. A  copy of th e ICF will be given to the subject.  
Subjects must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their 
participation in the study.  
Subject Data Prote ction 
Subjects will be assigned a unique identifier and will not be identified by name in eCRFs, 
study- related forms, study reports, or any related publications. Subject and investigator  
personal data will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In the event the study protocol, study report, or study data are include d in a public registry, all 
identifiable information from individual subjects or investigator s will be redacted according 
to applicable laws and regulations.  
The subject must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
sponsor  in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the subject. The subject must also be informed that his/her study- related data 
may be examined by sponsor  or contract research o rganization ( CRO)  auditors or other 
authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor , by appropriate EC members, and by 
inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
Disclosure  
All information provided regarding the study, as well as all information collected and/or documented duri ng the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential. The investigator  
(or designee) agrees not to disclose such information in any way without prior written permission from the sponsor . 
Data Quality Assurance  
The following data quality steps will be implemented:  
• All relevant subject data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRFs unless 
directly transmitted to the sponsor  or designee electronically (eg , laboratory data). The 
investigator  is responsible for verifying that data entries are accur ate and correct by 
electronically signing the eCRF.  
Protocol Amendment 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 2.0, 10  May  2021  Page 61 of 66  • The investigator  must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the eCRF.  
• The investigator  must permit study -related monitoring, audits, EC review, and 
regul atory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• The sponsor  or designee is responsible for the data management of this study 
including quality checking of the data. Predefined agreed risks, monitoring thresholds, 
quality toler ance thresholds, controls, and mitigation plans will be documented in a 
risk management register. Additional details of quality checking to be performed on the data may be included in a data management pl an.  
• A study m onitor will perform ongoing source dat a verification to confirm that data 
entered into the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
• Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator  in the study site archive for at least 5  years after 
the end of the study unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the spo nsor. No records may be transferred to another location or 
party without written notification to the sponsor .  
Investigator Documentation Responsibilities  
All individual, subject -specific study data will also be entered into a 21 Code of Federal 
Regulation s Part 11-compliant electronic data capture (EDC) system on an eCRF in a timely 
fashion.  
All data generated from external sources (eg, laboratory and bioanalytical data), and transmitted to the sponsor  or designee electronically, will be integrated with th e subject’s 
eCRF data in accordance with the data management p lan.  
An eCRF must be completed for each enrolled subject who undergoes any screening procedures, according to the eCRF completion instructions. The sponsor , or CRO, will 
review the supporting s ource documentation against the data entered into the eCRFs to verify 
the accuracy of the electronic data. The investigator  will ensure that corrections are made to 
the eCRFs and that data queries are resolved in a timely fashion by the study staff.  
The in vestigator  will sign and date the eCRF via the EDC system’s electronic signature 
procedure. These signatures will indicate that the investigator  reviewed and approved the data 
on the eCRF, data queries, and site notifications.  
Publications  
Publications will be addressed as follows :The results of this study may be published or 
presented at scientific meetings. If this is foreseen, the investigator  agrees to submit all

Study Title  
A Phase I, Single -center, Randomized, Double -blind, Double -dummy, Placebo - and 
Positive -Controlled Study to Investigate the Effects of CBP -307 on the QT C Interval in 
Healthy Subjects  
Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic CBP -307 plasma 
concentrations on the heart -rate corrected QT interval (QTc) in healthy subjects.  
The secondary objective s of the study are:  
• To demonstrate assay sensitivity of the study to detect a small QT effect using 
moxifloxacin as a positive control.  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of thera peutic and supratherapeutic multiple 
oral doses of CBP -307 in healthy subjects.  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of CBP -307 following administration of 
therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses in healthy subjects.  
• To evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic multiple oral doses of 
CBP -307 on heart rate (HR), PR and QRS intervals, and T -wave morphology. 
Study Design 
This will be a Phase I, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, placebo -controlled, 
positive -controlled, single -site, 3- arm study to investigate the effects of therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic oral doses of CBP -307 on the QTc interval in healthy male and female 
subjects.  
Potential subjects will be asked to read and sign an i nformed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed c onsent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eligibility to 
enter the study will be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After informed consent has 
been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported. After placebo  administration to all subjects on 
Day - 1, all adverse events (AEs), whether volunteered, elicited, or noted upon physical 
examination, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from Day - 1 until the end of the 
study).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 2 groups ( Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 
2 sub- groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group wi ll be randomized with 16 subjects. 
Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the morning on 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 7 of 64 Days 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 14, and on Day 15 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on 
Day - 1).  
The following treatments will b e administered:  
• A starting dose of CBP -307 for titration (0.1 mg, Day 1)  
• A therapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.2 mg, Day 2 to 5)  
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Day 6 to 14)  
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and CBP -307) 
• Moxifloxacin (400 mg)  
Moxifl oxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study 
with an expected peak QT effect (placebo -corrected change- from -baseline  QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec.  
Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibili ty to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day  -2 
and will remain at the study site until discharge on Day  16. Treatment administration will 
occur on Days 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 14, and 15 under fasting conditions  (all subjects will receive 
placebo on Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic electrocardiogram (ECG ) monitoring and 
recording will begin at least 25  hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day  1 
and continue through 24  hours after the administration of study treatments on Days 1, 5, 14, 
and 15 and at corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day - 1. Blood samples 
for PK analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint. Subjects will return to the  study site for a follow -up visit on Day 28±2 days. 
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administration of study treatments on Day 1). Cont inuous 
cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Days  -1, 1, 5, 14, and 
15. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day - 1. Replicate 12- lead ECGs will be extracted from the contin uous recording prior to 
dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples  will be collected at the following timepoints: prior to dosing 
and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day (Days 1, 5, 
14, and 15; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5 hour s postdose, 
±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes 
for 12 to 24 hours postdose ). Subjects will be inactive and in a supine position for at least 
10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which 
will end immediately prior to the PK sampling. When timepoints for ECG extraction, safety ECGs, vita l sign measurements, and blood draws coincide, procedures will be performed in 
said order. At each timepoint, up to 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time 
window (the last 5 minutes of the 15- minute period when the subject is maintained i n a 
supine, quiet position). The ECG effects of CBP -307 will be tested on data from Day -1 
(baseline for both groups), Day 5 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo), and Day 14

Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 8 of 64 (supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). Assay sensitivity with mo xifloxacin will be 
evaluated using ECG data collected on Days - 1, 1, 14, and 15. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to 
treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system  and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinic al laboratory tests, safety 12 -lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at screening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow -up visit.  
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screeni ng through follow -up 
visit) is anticipated to be approximately 58 days.  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first subject signs an ICF. The point of enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled).  
Number of Subjects  
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (at least 30% for each sex) will be randomized into 2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion  
Healthy male and female  subjects aged between 18 and 60 years (inclusive) with a body mass 
index between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m
2 (inclusive).  
Investigational Medicinal P roducts, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
The following treatments will be administered:  
• A starting dose of CBP -307 for titration (0.1 mg, Day 1; oral capsule ) 
• A therapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.2 mg, Day 2 to 5; oral capsule)  
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Day 6 to 14; oral capsule)  
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin, oral tablet and CBP -307; oral capsule ) 
• Moxifloxacin (400 mg; oral tablet) .

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 9 of 64 treatment period (Days -2 to 16) , and 12 ± 2 days for follow -up (Day 28± 2 days) , in total 
approximately 58 days.  
Endpoints  
Electrocardiogram (Cardiodynamic):  
The primary cardiodynamic endpoint is the change -from -baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF).  
The secondary cardiodynamic  endpoints are:  
• Change -from -baseline HR, PR, QRS ( ∆HR, ∆ PR, and ∆ QRS);  
• Placebo -corrected change- from -baseline HR, QTcF, PR, and QRS ( ∆∆HR, ∆∆QTcF, 
∆∆PR, and ∆∆QRS);  
• Categorical outliers for QTcF, HR, PR, and QRS;  
• Frequency of treatment -emergent changes of T - wave morphology and U -wave 
presence.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of plasma concentrations of CBP -307. The 
PK parameters of CBP -307 will be calculated using a model independent approach. The 
following PK parameter endpoints will be calculated: maximum observed conc entratio n 
(Cmax), area under the concentration -time curve from time zero  extrapolated  to infinity 
(AUC inf), area under the concentration- time curve from time zero to 24 hours postdose 
(AUC 0-24), and time of the maximum observed concentration ( tmax). Other noncompa rtmental 
parameters may be reported.  
Safety:  
Adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), 
12-lead ECGs , and vital signs measurements.  
Statistical Methods  
Cardiodynamic evaluation:  
The primary analysis will be based on concentration- QTc modeling of the relationship 
between plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and change -from- baseline QTcF (∆QTcF) with 
the intent to exclude an effect of placebo -corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) >  10 msec at clinically 
relevant plasma levels. Placebo -corrected ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS , and ∆ QTcF (ΔΔHR, ΔΔPR, 
ΔΔQRS , and ∆∆QTcF) will also be evaluated at each postdosing timepoint ('by- timepoint' 
analysis). An analysis of categorical outliers will be performed for changes in HR, PR, QRS, 
QTcF, T- wave morphology, and U -wave presence. Assay sensitivity will be evaluated by 
concentration -QTc analysis of the effect on ∆ΔQTcF of moxifloxacin using a similar model 
as for the primary analysis.

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 10 of 64 Pharmacokinetics:  
The analyses will be carr ied out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be 
presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, maximum  geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation) separately by 
cohor t. Indi vidual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time 
data will be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data may be 
provided as well.  
Pharmaco kinet ic/electrocardiography analyses:  
The relationship between CBP -307 plasma concentrations  and the change from ∆ QTcF will 
be evaluated using a linear mixed- effects modeling approach.  
Safety:  
All AEs  will be listed and treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized using the descriptive 
methodology. Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Observed values for clinical laboratory test data, 12 -lead ECGs , vital signs, and physical 
examination findings will be listed.

1.1. Disease Background  
Autoimmune diseases are serious disorders that afflict a large portion of the world 
population;  most have no cures. Significant advances have been made in the development of 
novel and disease -modifying therapies, but many of these new tre atments have significant 
side effects. Treatments are needed that provide better risk -to-benefit profiles than the 
existing therapeutic choices.  
T cells are important immune cells that mediate the development of autoimmune disorders. 
Migration of T cells f rom lymphoid tissues to the sites of inflammation is central to the 
functions of T cells, and this process is dependent on sphingosine -1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 
1 (S1P1)  which  is known to ameliorate a variety of autoimmune diseases in animals and 
humans. Down modulation of this receptor, using S1P1 agonists, prevents T cell egress and 
results in a reduced number of circulating lymphocytes, particularly the CD4+ - and CD8+ -
naïve and central -memory T cell subsets.  
1.2. Overview of CBP -307 
CBP -307 is a n S1P1  agonist that is being developed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases 
by Suzhou C onnect Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd.  CBP -307 (1 -(2-fluoro- 4-(5-(4-isobutylphenyl) -
1,2,4- oxadiazol -3-yl) benzyl)  azetidine -3-carboxylic acid hemihydrate) is a potent, selective, 
small-molecule agonist of S1P1 and S1P receptor 5. Cell -based assays have confirmed 
CBP -307 induces internalization of S1P1 from the cell surface. This is consistent with the 
known mechanism of action of other S1P1 agonists, in that they down- modulate S1P1 and 
inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues.  
1.2.1. Summary of Clinical Experience  
The Phase 1 development of CBP -307 comprised 2 completed studies in healthy subjects:  
• A single and multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of  
CBP -307 including pharmacokinetic ( PK), pharmacodynamic ( PD), and food- effect 
assessments (Study CBP -307AU001)  
• A single -dose and multiple -dose, and fixed- dose titration study to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of CBP -307 including PK and PD  (Study CB P-307CN001)  
Currently, CBP -307 is being evaluated in 2 Phase 2 studies :  
• Ongoing multicenter study in subjec ts with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis  
(Study CBP -307CN002) to compare the clinical efficacy by evaluating the clinical 
response to CBP -307 versus placebo and  the clinical remission and mucosal healing

tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo.  
• Ongoing study in subjec ts with moderate to severe  Crohn’s disease compare s clinical 
efficacy by evaluating the clinical response to CBP -307 versus placebo and the 
clinical remission and mucosal healing achieved by CBP -307 versus placebo  and to 
compare the clinical safety and tolerability of CBP -307 with those of placebo. 
1.2.1.1.  Safety  
Study CBP -307AU001  
A total of 44 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. There were 28 subjects evaluated 
using the single -dose regimen  (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 2.5 mg CBP -307) of which 21 subjects 
received CBP -307 and 7 subjects receive d placebo. Another 16 healthy subjects were 
evaluated using the multiple -dose regimen ( 0.15 and 0.25 mg CBP -307 given once daily 
[QD] for 28 consecutive days ) of which 12 subjects received  CBP -307 and 4 subjects 
received placebo. 
Overall,  no unexpected safety signals  were identified  and no deaths occurred in this study. 
For the single -dose regiment, no subject s were discontinued due to a treatment -emergent AE 
(TEAE). In the multiple -dose regimen, there were 2 subjects who were discontinued from the 
study (due to incre ased alanine transaminase and second degree AV block [not considered to 
be clinically significant, as judged by the investig ator]). A ll TEAEs resolved by the end of 
the study.  
In the single -dose regimen groups, TEAEs  were reported in 12 of 21 subjects  (57.1%) treated 
with CBP -307 and in 3 of 7 subjects  (42.8%)  treated with placebo. Most (91.7%) of the 
TEAEs in these subjects were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in the 
CBP -307-treated groups were headache (28.6%); dizziness (19.0%); and bradycardia ( 9.5%). 
Bradycardia was reported only in 2 subjects receiving the highest (2.5 mg) CBP -307 dose . 
One subject had a serious adverse event (SAE) of bradycardia (associated with transient 
asystole) following a single  dose of 2.5 mg CBP -307. 
In the multiple -dose regimen groups, CBP -307 at doses of 0.15 and 0.25 mg QD was 
generally well tolerated over the 28 days of dosing. Treatment -emergent AEs were reported 
in 11 of 12 subjects (91.7%) in the CBP -307 groups and 2 of 4 subjects (50.0%) in the 
placeb o groups. Most (83.3% ) TEAEs were mild in severity. The most common TEAEs in 
the 2 CBP -307 groups were headache (50.0%), and fatigue, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain 
(16.7% each). The incidences of these TEAEs were similar in both CBP -307-treated groups. 
No SAEs were reported for subjects in the multiple -dose regimen.  
Study CBP -307CN001  
A total of 30 eligible subjects completed 3 CBP -307 dose groups in ascending order of dose 
after randomization (in a ratio of 1:1:1): Group A (0.1 mg), Group B (0.2 mg), and Group C (0.3 mg). Each dose group consisted of 10 subjects, including 8 subjects receiving the investigational drug and 2 subjects receiving placebo by random assignment. The administration started from the dose of 0.1 mg. The subjects in this group rece ived a single

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 19 of 64 dose of CBP -307 or placebo and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 
7 days. Then the subjects received 0.1 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 14 consecutive days 
and were followed up for safety and tolerance within the next 7 days. Dose escalation did not 
occur until the review of the single -dose regimen safety data from the 6  subjects in the 
previous dose cohort, and the safety data did not meet the termination criteria.  The subjects in 
the dose of 0.3 mg received fi xed-dose ti tration regimen, ie,  0.05 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD 
for 3  consecutive days ; 0.1 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days ; 0.2 mg 
CBP -307 or placebo QD for 2 consecutive days ; finally,  0.3 mg CBP -307 or placebo QD for 
14 consecutive days, and the subj ects were followed up for safety and tolerance within the 
next 7 days.  
Overall, no unexpected safety signals were identified, and there were no deaths,  SAEs, or 
AEs leading to the subject’s early withdrawal from the study after administration of CBP -307. In the safety set, a total of 29 subjects ( 8 in Group A, 100%; 8 in Group B, 100%; 
8 in Group C, 100% and 5 in placebo group, 83.3%) experienced TEAEs. 
During the single -dose period, a total of 14 subjects (5 of 8 in Group A, 62.5%; 6 of 8 in 
Group B, 75%, and 3 of 4 in placebo group, 75%) developed AEs. T he incidence of TEAEs 
in Group A was generally similar to the placebo group. Among TEAEs in Group B, the 
incidence of AEs related to abnormalities in investigations was higher than that in placebo group, including lymphocyte count decreased (12.5%), white blood cell ( WBC ) count 
decreased (12.5% ), neutrophil count decreased ( 12.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased 
(25%), and gamma -glutamyltransferase increased (12.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased (12.5%). Additionally, 1 subject experienced heart rate (HR) decreased (12.5%).  
During dose -titration period, 2 subjects (2 of 8 in Group C, 25%) experienced TEAEs. The 
TEAEs r eported in Group C during the titration period included cough (12.5%) and increased 
upper airway secretion (12.5%). There were no TEAEs in the placebo group during this period.  
During repeated- dose period, a total of 28 subjects (8 of 8 in Group A, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group 
B, 100%; 8 of 8 in Group C, 100%; and 4 of 6 in placebo group, 66.7%) experienced AEs. The most frequent TEAE in Group A was uppe r respiratory tract infection ( 37.5%) compared 
with placebo group; the most frequent TEAEs in Group B and Group C included decreased lymphocyte count (Group B, 87.5%; Group C, 100.0%), WBC  count ( Group B, 87.5%; 
Group C, 62.5%), and neutrophil count ( Group B, 50%; Group C, 12.5%). The TEAEs noted 
in Group B during the repeated -dose period also included increased ala nine aminotransferase 
(25%), gamma -glutamyltransferase (37.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase (12.5%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (12.5%), influenza (12.5%), chest pain (12.5%), lethargy (25%), and neck pain (12.5%); TEAEs in Group C during the rep eated -dose period also included 
increased alanine aminotransferase (25%), decreased HR (12.5%), and mouth ulcer (12.5%); the TEAEs in placebo group included increased transaminase (16.7%), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (1/6, 16.7%), decre ased hemoglobin (16.7%), upper respiratory 
tract infection (16.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), dizziness (16.7%), and palpitations (16.7%).

1.2.1.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
CBP -307 given orally as a single dose  was readily absorbed; drug concentrations peaked at 
approximately 6 hours after administration, with an elimination apparent terminal elimination 
half-life (t1/2) of approximately 25 hours (range of 23 to 29 hours). The time to maximum 
observed concentration (Cmax) in the blood was delayed from 6 hours to approximately 
10 hours when CBP -307 was given with a high -fat diet. Food consumption also increased 
exposure  (Table  1). 
For the single -dose ad ministration, CBP -307 exposure  (based on C max and area under the 
concentration -time curve  [AUCs ]) increased with increasing dose following a single -dose 
administration  (Table  1).

1.3. Overview of Moxifloxacin  
Moxifloxacin is a broad -spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that binds to and inhibits the 
hERG IKr α subunit and causes a mean increase of the QTc interval of 6 ms after a single 
400-mg oral dose. Moxifloxacin is commonly used as a positive control in thorough QT 
(TQT) studies to satisfy the requirements of International Council for/Conference on Harmonisation  (ICH)  E14. 
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert of AVELOX (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) tablets for additional information.

1.4. Study Rationale  
Regulatory guidance (ICH E14) has emphasized the need to obtain clear robust data on the 
effect of new chemical entities on electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters with focus on cardiac 
repolarization as measured by  the QTc duration. Though many Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials may be 
conducted they usually have an insufficient sample size, infrequent sampling of ECG data, or 
the use of inadequate controls to  overcome the high rate of spontaneous change in QTc 
duration. This has resulted in regulatory guidance recommending a dedicated or thorough trial to define the ECG effects of new drugs.  
This study will be done in healthy subjects to eliminate variables known to have an effect on 
ECG parameters (concomitant drugs, diseases, etc.). A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 is 
required to mimic the exposure in healthy subjects that may occur in the target population under the worst of circumstances (eg, concomitant use of cytochrome P450 [ CYP ]3A4

dose prescribed) and to allow for PK to QTc modeling to assess the effect of drug concentration on cardiac repolarization. 
1.5. Benefi t-risk Assessment  
Healthy subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an 
assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study . The risks of participation 
are primarily those associated with adverse react ions to the study treatments, although there 
may also be some discomfort from the collection of blood samples and other study procedures. More information about the known and expected benefits, risks , and reasonably 
anticipated AEs associated with CBP -307 may be found in the I B.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This will be a Phase I, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, placebo -controlled, 
positive-controlled, single -site, 3- arm study to investigate  the effect s of therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic oral doses of CBP -307 on the QTc interval in he althy male and female 
subjects.  
Potential subjects will be asked to read and sign an i nformed consent f orm (ICF). After 
informed consent is obtained, screening procedures and tests to establish subject eligibility to 
enter the study w ill be performed within 28 days before Day 1. After informed consent has 
been obtained but prior to the initiation of study treatment administration, only SAEs  will be 
reported. After placebo  administration to all subjects on Day -1, all AEs, whether

study (ie , from Day - 1 until the end of the study).  
In this study, approximately 64 healthy subjects ( at least  30% for each sex ) will be 
randomized into 2 groups  (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 
2 sub- groups (Group 2A and 2B) and each sub- group will be randomized with 16 subjects . 
Randomized subjects will receive the assigned study drug as a single dose in the morning on 
Days 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 14, and on Day 15 (placebo will be administered to all subjects on Day - 1).  
The follow ing treatments will be administered:  
• A starting dose of CBP -307 for titration (0.1 mg, Day 1)  
• A therapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.2 mg, Day s 2 to 5)  
• A supratherapeutic dose of CBP -307 (0.5 mg, Day s 6 to 14)  
• Placebo (matched to moxifloxacin and  CBP -307) 
• Moxifloxacin ( 400 mg)   
Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control to determine the assay sensitivity of this study with an expected peak QT effect (p lacebo -corrected change- from -baseline QTcF; ∆∆QTcF) 
of 10 to 15 msec.  
An overview of the study design is shown in Figure  1.

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 25 of 64 Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 27 days 
prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day  -2 
and will remain at  the study site until discharge on Day  16. T reatment administration will 
occur on Days  1, 2 to 5, 6 to 14, and 15 under fasting conditions  (all subjects will receive 
placebo on Day -1). Continuous cardiodynamic ECG monitoring and recording will begin at 
least 25 hours prior to the administration of study treatments  on Day 1 and continue through 
24 hours after the administration of study treatments  on Days  1, 5, 14, and 15 and at 
corresponding timepoints on the day before dosing, ie, Day - 1. Blood samples for PK 
analysis will be collected predose and at each postdose cardiodynamic ECG timepoint. 
Subjects will return to the study site for a follow -up visit on Day 28±2 days. 
Baseline for the primary analysis will be determined from predose timepoints collected for 25 hours on Day -1 (prior to administrat ion of study treatments on Day 1). Continuous 
cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Days  -1, 1, 5, 14, and 
15. The recording will be started 1 hour before dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day - 1. Replicate 12- lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to 
dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each day. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected at the following timepoints: prior to dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK sampling day ( Days  1, 5, 
14, and 15; sample collection windows are as follows: ±2 minutes for 0.5 hour s postdose, 
±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose, ±10 minutes for 6 to 8 hours postdose, and ±30 minutes 
for 12 to 24 hours postdose ). Subjects will be inactive and in a supine position for at least 
10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each cardiodynamic ECG extraction timepoint, which 
will end immediately prior to the PK sampling. When timepoints for ECG extraction, safety 
ECGs, vital sign measurements, and blood draws coincide, procedures will be performed in 
said order. At each timepoint, up to 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute time 
window (the last 5 minutes of the 15- minute pe riod when the subject is maintained in a 
supine, quiet position). The ECG effects of CBP -307 will be tested on data from Day -1 
(baseline for both groups), Day 5 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo) , and Day 14 
(supratherapeutic concentrations versu s placebo). Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be 
evaluat ed using ECG data collected on Days - 1, 1, 14, and 15. 
The central ECG laboratory (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be blinded to treatment. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be exported from the system and 
sent to the central ECG laboratory for review. Resting ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected from predetermined timepoints specified above and will be read by the central ECG laboratory. 
Safety assessments including AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, safety 1 2-lead ECGs , 
and physical examination findings will be performed at s creening and at specific timepoints 
during the study, and/or at the follow -up visit.  
The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening  through follow -up 
visit) is anticipated to be approximately 58 days . 
The start of the study is defined as the date the first  subject  signs an ICF . The point of 
enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation. The end of the study is defined as 
the date of the last subject’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled).

3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for CBP -307 to cause QT prolongation. 
As CBP -307 exposure affects heart rate, the primary endpoint for this study will be the QTcF.  
The study will be randomized and double -blind because randomization eliminates 
confounding by baseline va riables and blinding eliminates confounding by co- interventions, 
thus eliminating the possibility that the observed effects of the intervention are because of 
differential use of othe r treatments.  
The sample size for this study is based on a formal statistical power calculation . 
Conducting the study in healthy subjects mitigates the potential confounding effects of the 
disease state and concomitant medications.  Both male and female subjects will be included to 
eliminate similar known ECG variability effects.  
Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP -307, subjects will be 
fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 4 hours postdose  on 
the days when PK samples are collected . 
Pharmacokinetic assessments of CBP -307 concentrations in plasma will be evaluated during 
the study. The timepoints for the PK sample collections are based on previous studies and are 
considered adequate to allow for the characterization of the drug’s PK af ter oral dosing. 
Furthermore, the chosen PK sample collection for CBP -307 is anticipated to be sufficient to 
allow reasonable estimation of t 1/2 during the terminal elimination phase.  
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
According to ICH E14, the highest thera peutic dose and a supratherapeutic dose are 
recommended for the QT/QTc study. The CBP -307 doses of 0.2 and 0.5 mg were chosen for 
evaluation in this study based on observed PK results in completed Phase 1 studies. To 
carefully monitor safety following the administration of CBP -307 doses in  Group 1, CBP -307 
doses will be up -titrated as follows: subjects will rece ive a s tarting dose of 0.1 mg CBP -307 
on Day 1 followed by an up- titrated dose of  0.2 mg on Days  2 to 5. Prior clinical experience 
with CBP -307 has not demonst rated clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test 
results in the majority of subjects or a dose -response r elationship for safety based on AEs . 
A single dose of 0.5 mg is the planned supratherapeutic dose, which balances the character istics of the study design with the safety of healthy subject s. Testing of CBP -307 at 
substantial  multiples of the anticipated maximum therapeutic exposure is not clinically 
warranted due to the known safety and tolerability profile of CBP -307.  
Further de tails are provided in the IB.

Subjects  will have a unique identification number  used at  screening . Eligible s ubjects will be 
assigned a subject number prior to the  first dosing occasion. Assignment of  subject  numbers 
will be in ascending order and no numbers will be omitted (eg, Subjects  0101, 0102, 0103). 
The screening number will be used on all safety samples throughout the study. Replacement 
subjects ( Section  4.4) will be assigned a subject number corresponding to the number of the 
subject he/she is replacing plus 1000 (eg, Subject  1101 replaces Subject  0101). 
Subjects will be identified by screening  identification number or  subject number only on all 
study documentation. A list identifying the subjects by subject number will be kept in the s ite 
master f ile. 
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
A subject is free to withdraw their informed consent from the study at any time  or they may 
be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or the sponsor for safety, 
behavioral, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol -required visit s or 
procedures . In addition, a subject will be withdrawn  from dosing if any of the following 
criteria are met:  
• change in compliance with any inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant 
and affects subject safety  as determined by the investigator (or designee ) 
• noncompliance with the study restrictions that might affect subject safety or study 
assessments/objectives, as considered applicable by the investigator  (or designee)  
• any clinically relevant sign or symptom that , in the opinion o f the investigator  (or 
designee) , warrants subject withdrawal . 
If a subject is withdrawn from dosing, the sponsor  will be notified and the date and reason(s) 
for the withdrawal will be documented in the subject ’s electronic c ase report f orm ( eCRF). If 
a subject is withdrawn  from the study, efforts will be made to perform  all follow -up 
assessments, if possible ( Appendix 6).  Other procedures may be perform ed at  the 
investigator ’s (or designee’s)  and/or sponsor ’s discretion. If the subject is in -house, these 
procedures should be performed before the subject is discharged from the clinic. The 
investigator  (or designee) may also request that the su bject return  for an additional follow -up 
visit. All withdrawn subjects will be followed until resolution of all their AEs or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator  (or designee) to have stabilized.  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, e very effort should be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return for a final visit, if app licable, and follow -up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.  
Subjects who are withdrawn for reasons not related to study treatment  may be replaced 
following discussion between the investigator and the sponsor . Subjects withdrawn as a result 
of AEs thought to be related to the study treatment will generally not be replaced .

approximatel
y 240 mL of room 
temperature 
water . 
 
All supplies of the IMP, both bulk and subject -specific, will be stored in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s or pharmacy’s instructions. Until dispensed to the subjects, the study 
treatments will be stored at the study site in a location that is locked with restricted access.  
5.2. Study Treatment Administration  
Each dose of study treatment ( CBP -307, placebo, or moxifloxacin)  will be administered 
orally following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, with approximately 240 mL of room 
temperature water. Additionally, because food has been shown to alter the PK of CBP -307, 
subjects will be fasted at least 10 hours prior to dose administration and remain fasted for 4 hours postdose  on the days when PK samples are collected . 
Subjects will be dosed in numerical order while sitting or standing but not be permitted to lie supine for 2  hours after treatment administration , except as necessitated by the occurrence of 
an AE(s) and/or study procedures.  
5.3. Randomization  
This is a double -blind  randomized study. Subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment 
sequences  before  administ ration of the first dose of study treatment. A randomization list will 
be generated by a statistician using a computer -generated pseudo -random permutation 
procedure . The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and 
on the enrollment eCRF. A computer -generated randomization schedule and emergency 
code -break envelopes will be provided to the study site. Randomization details will be 
included in the randomization specification.  
5.4. Blinding  
This is a double -blinded study. The foll owing controls will be employed to maintain the 
double -blind status of the study:  
• The placebo will be identical in appearance to CBP -307 or moxif loxacin.

Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 34 of 64 • The investigator and other members of staff involved with the study will remain 
blinded to the treatme nt randomization code during the assembly procedure. 
• Interim bioanalytical data will be provided to Covance Early Clinical Biometrics  in a 
blinded manner.  
To maintain the blind, the investigator will be provided with a sealed randomization code for each su bject, containing coded details of the treatment. These individual ly sealed envelopes 
will be kept in a limited access area that is accessible 24 hours a day. If, in order to manage subject safety or to support dose escalation dec isions (in the event of possibly 
treatment- related SAEs or severe AEs), the decision to unblind resides solely with the 
investigator. Whenever possible, and providing it does not interfere with or delay any 
decision in the best interest of the subject, the investigator will discuss  the intended 
code -break with the sponsor. If it becomes necessary to break the code during the study, the 
date, time, and reason will be recorded in the subject's source data and on the individual envelope and will be witnessed by a second person. 
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance:  
• All doses will be administered under the supervision of suitably qualified study site 
staff. 
• Immediately after dose administration, visual inspection of the mouth and hands will 
be performed for each subject . 
• At each dosing occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of IMP will be performed.    
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The investigator  (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of study 
treatments (CBP -307, moxifloxacin, placebo -matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched 
moxifloxacin)  received. In addition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, 
specifying the amount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensing. This drug 
accountability record wi ll be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the 
study, the original drug accountability record will be available for review by the sponsor  
upon request. 
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarde d upon 
satisfactory completion of the compliance and accountability procedures. Any unused 
assembled unit doses will be retained until the completion of the study.  
At the completion of the study, all unused study treatments (CBP -307, moxifloxacin, 
placebo -matched  CBP -307, and placebo- matched moxifloxacin) will be disposed of by the 
study site ’s pharmacy ( RAH Pharmacy) , per the sponsor ’s written instructions.  If destruction 
is authorized to take place at the study site ’s pharmacy, the investigator must ensur e that the 
materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations and 
institutional policy. All study drug destructions must be adequately documented.

6.1. Concomitant Therapies 
Subjects will  refrain from the use of any prescription  or nonprescription medication s/products  
during the study until the follow -up visit, unless the investigator  (or designee)  and/or sponsor  
have given their prior consent. Medications taken within 28 days before study treatment 
administration will be documented as a prior treatment. Treatments taken after study 
treatment administration will be documented as concomitant treatments.  
Paracetamol /acetaminophen ( 2 g/day for up to 3 consecutive days) is an  acceptable 
concomitant medication. The administration of any other concomitant medications during the 
study is prohibited without prior approval of the investigator  (or designee) , unless its use is 
deemed necessary for the treatment of an AE . Any medication taken by a subject during the 
course of the study and the reason for its use will be documented in the source data.   
Females will refrain from the use of  hormone replacement therapy  and oral, implantable, 
transdermal, injectable , or intrauterine  hormonal contraceptives (with the exception of 
Mirena®) during the study until the follow -up visit (See Appendix 4) . 
6.2. Diet 
While confined at the study site, subjects will receive a standardized diet at scheduled times that do not conflict with other study- related activities. Subjects will be  fasted overnight ( at 
least 10 hours ) before the collection of blood sample s for c linical laboratory evaluations . 
On the days with PK assessments ( Appendix 6), the subjects will be fasted  overnight ( at least  
10 hours ) prior to dosing and refrain from consuming wate r from 1 hour predose until  1 hour  
postdose, excluding the amount of water consumed at dosing. Food is allowed from 4 hours

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 36 of 64 6.4. Exercise  
Subjects are required to refrain fr om strenuous exercise from  7 days  before check -in until the 
follow -up visit  (Day 28±2 days ) and will otherwise maintain their normal level of physical 
activity during this time (ie, will not begin a new exercise program nor participate in any 
unusually strenuous physical exertion). 
6.5. Blood Donation  
Subjects are required to refrain from donation of blood from 3 months prior to screening, 
plasma from 2 weeks prior to screening, and platelets from 6 weeks prior to screening until 
3 months after the follow -up visit.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures as closely as possible to the nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, 
and the other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint.  
The highest priority procedures will be performed closest to the nominal time. The order of 
priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority):  
• dosing  
• continuous ECG extraction window  
• pharmacokinetic blood samples 
• safety assessments  
• any other procedures . 
This study includes a screening period (Day - 28 to Day - 2), a treatment period (Days -1 to 
16), and a follow -up period (Day 28 ±2 days ).  
The defined abnormal vital sign measurements ( Exclusion Criteria #4) at check- in (Day -2) 
or baseline (Day -1 predose) will only be considered exclusionary if judged applicable by the 
investigator. For confirmation of enrollment eligibility based on pulse rate , the pulse rate 
assessed by vital signs, rather than the 12- lead ECG, will be used. For all subjects, the 
screening, check -in, or baseline blood pressure, pulse rate , and respiratory rate may be 
repeated after 5 to 10 minutes if the initial reading is believed to be atypical for the subject.  
7.1. Gene ral Assessments  
7.1.1. Demographics  
Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 37 of 64 7.1.2. Medical History  
At the timepoint specified in Appendix 6, the investigator or designee will collect a complete 
medical and surgical history. Medical history will include information on the subject’s 
concurrent me dical conditions and any events occurring prior to the first dose of study 
treatment. All findings will be recorded on the medical history eCRF.  
7.2. Electrocardiography Assessments  
7.2.1. Continuous 12 -lead Electrocardiogram Recording  
Continuous 12- lead digital ECG r ecording will be performed as specified in Appendix 6. All 
ECG data will be collected using a Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG continuous 12- lead 
digital recorder. The 12- lead Holter (or Mortara Surveyor) ECG equipment will be supplied 
and supported by ERT (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, PA). The continuous 12-lead digital ECG data will be stored onto SD memory cards .  
The ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected by pred etermined timepoints as defined 
in Appendix  6 and will be read centrally by ERT  (eResearch Technology Inc., Philadelphia, 
PA). The following principles will be fol lowed in ERT’s core laboratory:  
• ECG analysts are blinded to the subject, visit, and treatment allocation.  
• Baseline and on -treatment ECGs for a particular subjec t will be over- read on the same 
lead and will be analyzed by the same reader.  
The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analy zable, then the primary lead of 
analysis will be changed to another lead for the entire subject data set.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be extracted in up to 10 replicates at the predefined timepoints and 
subjects will be inactive and in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each nominal time.  
7.2.1.1.  TQT Plus Extraction Technique  
Ten 14- second digital 12 -lead ECG tracings will be extracted from the continuous Holter (or 
Mortara Surveyor)  recordings using the ‘TQT Plus method’, a computer -assisted and 
statistical process utilized by ERT . The method enables extraction of ECGs with the lowest 
HR variability and noise within the protocol -specified extraction time window ( eg, the HR 
and QT changes from beat -to-beat in the range of <10%). At each protocol -specified 
timepoint, 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute “ECG window ” (typically, 
the last 5 minutes of the 15- minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine, quiet 
position ). 
7.2.1.2.  Expert  Precision QT Analysis  
Expert  precision QT analysis will be performed on all analyzable (non -artifact) beats in the 
10 ECG replicate s. Statistical quality control procedures  are used to review and assess all 
beats and identify “high” and “low” confidence beats using several criteria, including:  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 38 of 64 • QT or QTc values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely).  
• RR values ex ceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely).  
• Rapid changes in QT, QTc, or RR from beat -to-beat.  
Measurements of all primary ECG parameters (QT, QTc, RR) in all recorded beats of all 
replicates that are deemed “high confidence” will be perfo rmed using COMPAS software. 
All low -confidence beats will be reviewed manually and adjudicated using pass- fail criteria. 
The final QC assessment will be performed by a cardiologist. The beats found acceptable by manual review will be included in the analys is. The median QT, QTc, and RR value s from 
each extracted replicate will be calculated, and then the mean of all available medians from a nominal timepoint will be used as the subject’s reportable value at that timepoint.  
Categorical T -wave morphology anal ysis and the measurement of PR and QRS interval of the 
ECG (QRS) intervals will be performed manually in 3 of the 10 ECG replicates at each timepoint. Each fiducial point (onset of P -wave, onset of Q -wave, offset of S -wave, and 
offset of T -wave) will be el ectronically marked.  
For T- wave morphology and U -wave presence, treatment -emergen t changes will be assessed 
(ie, changes not present at baseline). For each cat egory of T -wave morphology and U -waves, 
the category will be deemed as present if observed in an y replicate at the timepoint. For 
baseline, the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate from all timepoints that constitute baseline.  
7.2.2. Safety 12- lead Electrocardiogram  
Resting 12- lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine and at rest for at 
least 5  minutes at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Single 
12-lead ECGs will be repeated twice, and an average taken of the 3 readings, if either of the 
following criteria applies : 
• QT interval corrected for HR using Fridericia’s method (QTcF)  is >500 ms 
• QTcF change from the baseline (predose) is >60  ms. 
Additional 12- lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinically 
appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of ECGs is required. The investigator (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of each 12 -lead 
ECG.  
7.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.3.1. Pharmacokinetic  Blood Sample Collection and Processing  
Blood samples ( approximately 1 ×  3 mL for CBP -307 and moxifloxacin assays) will be 
collected by veni puncture or cannulation at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments in  Appendix 6. Procedures for collection, processing, and shipping of PK blood 
samples will be detailed in a separate document .

Plasma concentrations of CBP -307 and moxifloxacin will be determined using a validated 
analytical procedure. Spe cifics of the analytical method  will be provided in a separate 
document.  
7.4. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
7.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions, assignment of severity and causality, and procedures for reporting 
SAEs are detailed in  Appendix 1.  
The condition of each subject will be monitored from the time of signing the ICF until the follow -up visit . Subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their 
condition by open questioning, such as “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”, at least once each day while resident at the study site and each study visit. Subjects 
will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during the 
study.  
All nonserious AEs, whether reported by the subject voluntarily or upon questioning,  or 
noted on physical examination, will be recorded from initiation of placebo administration to 
all subjects (Day - 1) until study completion. I f AEs that occur in th e screening prior to 
placebo administration to all subjects (Day - 1) are considered to be related to the study 
procedure, they should be also collected. Serious AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the ICF until study completion.  The nature , time of onset, duration, and severity 
will be documented, together with an investigator ’s (or designee’s) opinion of the 
relationship to study treatment . 
Adverse events recorded  during the course of the study will be  followed up, where possible, 
to resolution or until the unresolved AEs are judged by the investigator  (or designee) to have 
stabilized . This will be completed at the investigator’s (or designee’s ) discretion.  
7.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for c linical laboratory evaluations  at the times 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Clinical laboratory evaluations are 
listed in Appendix 2.  
A serum qualitative pregnancy or urine test (females only) and follicle -stimulating hormone  
test (postmenopausal females only) will be performed at the timepoints specified in Appendix 6. A positive urine pregnancy test will  be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  
All pregnancies should be reported as specified in Appendix  1. 
Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed a t other times if judged to be 
clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of clinical laboratory safety evaluations is required. At the discretion of the investigator, clinically significant clinical labo ratory assessments may be confirmed by repeat 
sampling. If the clinical significance is confirmed, subjects will be excluded from

for as long as the investiga tor considers necessary.  
Subjects will be asked to provide urine samples for drugs of abuse screen and cotinine test , 
and will undergo an alcohol breath test  at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
in Appendix  6. For all female subjects, a pregnancy test will be performed at the times 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6.   
An investigator ( or designee)  will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical laboratory data.  
7.4.3. Vital Signs  
Supine  blood pressure, supine pulse rate , respiratory rate, and tympanic temperature will be 
assessed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 6. Vital signs 
may also be performed at other times if ju dged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing 
review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of vital signs is required.  
All measurements will be performed singly . For all subjects, the screening, check -in, or 
baseline blood pressure, pulse r ate, and respiratory rate may be repeated after 5 to 10 minutes 
if the initial reading is believed to be atypical for the subject.  
Subjects must be supine  for at least 5  minutes before blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements.  
7.4.4. Physical Examination  
A full physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Appendix 6. Physical examinations include general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat , neck (including thyroid and nodes), cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, skin, and  other s. 
Height, weight, and body mass index will be assessed at screeni ng. 
8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 64 healthy subjects (a t least  30% for each sex ) will be randomized into 
2 groups (Group 1 and 2) with 32 subjects in each. Group 2 consists of 2 sub -groups 
(Group 2A and 2B) and e ach sub -group will be randomized with 16 subjects.  
Sample S ize for P rimary A nalysis:  
A sample size of 28 evaluable subjects per treatment group will provide more than 9 4.4% 
power to exclude that CBP -307 causes more than 10- msec QTc effect at clinically relevant 
plasma levels, as shown by the upper bound of the 2- sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of 
the model -predicted QT effect (Δ ΔQTcF) at the observed geometric mean C
max of CBP -307 
in the study. This power is estimated approximately using a 2 -sample t -test. The calculation 
assumes a 1- sided 5% significance level, a n underlying effect of CBP -307 of 3 msec and a 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245  Protocol Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18 March 2021  Page 41 of 64 standard deviation (SD) of the ΔQTcF of 8 msec for both CBP-307 and placebo treatment 
groups. Note that this calculation is conservative, since i t does not take into account any gain 
in precision due to the use of all data of each subject with the help of a linear mixed- effects 
model. The concentration-QTc analysis method is supported by Darpo et al 20153 and 
Ferber  et al, 2015,4 and consistent with the experiences from 25 recent TQT studies. 
Sample Size Considerations for Assay Sensitivity : 
To demonstrate assay  sensitivity with concentration- QTc analysis, it has to be shown that the 
ΔΔQTcF of a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin exceeds 5 msec (ie, the lower bound of the 
2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc effect [ΔΔQTcF] should exceed 5 msec). In a similarly 
designed, recent crossover study with 24 healthy subjects (on- file data , ERT) , the standard 
error (SE) for the prediction of the QT effect of moxifloxacin based on the exposure-response analysis was 1.24 msec. The within -subject SD of ΔQTcF in the referred study was 5.4 msec 
based on the by- timepoint analysis. If the effect of moxifloxacin is assumed to be 10 msec, 
the SE of 1.24 msec corresponds to an effect size of (10-5)/(1.24×sqrt[24])=0.82, where the effect size is the effect assumed under the alternati ve hypothesis divided by the SD of the test 
variable. This value should be compared to the effect size of 0. 64 required to guarantee a 
power of at least 95% in a paired  t-test situation with a sample size of 28  evaluable subjects. 
In other words, based on this calculation, a power of at least 95% will be obtained as long as the variability of the ΔQTcF, as measured by its within -subject SD  from the by- timepoint 
analysis, does not exceed 6.9 msec (ie, 1 28% [= 0.82/0.64] of the 5.4 msec observed in the 
referr ed study assuming the ratio of effective sizes is consistent with inverse ratio of 
within -subject SD ). The number also agrees with recent recommendations of the FDA, which 
propose at least 20 subjects.

8.2. Analysis Populations  
8.2.1. Cardiodynamic Population  
The QT/QTc population will include all subjects in the safety population with measurements at baseline as well as on -treatment with at least 1 postdose timepoint with a valid ΔQTcF 
value. The QT/QTc population will be used for the by- timepoint and categorical analyses of 
the cardiodynamic ECG parameters.  
The PK/QTc population will include all subjects who are in both the QT/QTc and PK populations with at least 1 pair of postdose PK and ∆ QTcF data from the same timepoint  as 
well as subjects in the QT/QTc population who received placebo. The PK/QTc population will be used for the concentration- QTc analysis and assay sensitivity. PK/QTc population 
will be def ined for CBP -307, and for moxifloxacin.  
The as-treated principle will be applied to all analysis populations mentioned below. 
8.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product an d have evaluable PK data of any of the analytes (CBP -307 and moxifloxacin). A 
subject will be excluded from the PK summary statistics and statistical analysis if the subject 
has an AE of vomiting that occurs at or before 2 times median time to maximum concentration.

The safety population will include all  subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product drug (therapeutic and supra therapeutic doses of CBP -307, moxifloxacin, or  placebo) . 
8.3. Cardiodynamic ECG Analyses  
Baseline  for Cardiodynamic ECG Assessments  
Baseline for the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 (CBP 307 in Group 1 versus 
placebo  in Groups 2A and 2B ) will be time -matched values on Day - 1.  
For assay sensitivity  in Groups 2A and 2B , the following baselines will  be used:  
• Group 2A: For moxifloxacin administered  on Day 1, baseline will be Day 15, on 
which subjects are administered placebo. For placebo- correction in this group, 
placebo values will be derived from Day 14 on which subjects are administered 
placebo, and baseline will be obtained on Day - 1. 
• Group 2B: For moxifloxacin administere d on Day 15, baseline will be Day 1, on 
which subjects are administered  placebo. For the placebo -correction in this group, 
Day - 1 values will be used as placebo (no treatment) and  baseline will be obtained on 
Day 14. 
Concentration- QTc Analysis  (Primary Analysis)  
The relationship between CBP -307 plasma concentrations and change -from -baseline QTcF 
(∆QTcF) will be quantified using a linear mixed- effects modeling approach with ΔQTcF as  
the dependent variable, time -matched concentrations of CBP -307 as  the exploratory variate  
(0 for placebo), treatment (act ive=1 or placebo=0) , and time (ie , postbaseline timepoint s on 
Days 1, 5, and 14 categorical ) as fixed effects , and a random intercept and slope per subject.6  
The degrees of freedom estimates will be determined by the Kenward -Roger method. From 
the model, the slope (ie , the regression parameter for the CBP -307 concentration) and the 
treatment effect -specific intercept will be estimated together with 2 -sided 90% CI . The 
estimates for the time effect will be reported with degrees of freedom and SE.  
For the assessment of the ECG effect of CBP -307 versus placebo, the time term incorporated 
into the models (both by- time point analysis and concentration -QTc analysis [or assay 
sensit ivity]) includes the single pre dose timepoint and all post dose time points on Days 1, 5, 
and 14, and Days 1 and 15 for active versus placebo and moxifloxacin versus placebo, 
respectively. All times are relative to the time of dosing on that day which is considered the 
first dose for the assay sensitivity analysis. For the analysis of CBP -307 versus placebo , the 
first dose of study treatment is on Day 1. 
The geometric mean of the individual C max values for CBP -307 concentrations for subjects in 
the active drug groups on each of Days 5 and 14 will be determined, respectively. The 
predicted effect and it s 2-sided 90% CI for placebo- corrected change- from -baseline QTcF

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 43 of 64 (ΔΔQTcF) (ie , slope estimate × concentration + treatment effect -specific intercept) at this 
geometric mean C max will be obtained.  
To evaluate the adequacy of model fit with respect to the as sumption of linearity, the 
observed ΔQTcF values adjusted by population time effect estimated from the model will be 
used. These individual placebo- adjusted ΔQTcF i,k (ΔΔQTcF i,k) values equal the observed 
individual ΔQTcF i,k for subject i administered with active drug or placebo at timepoint k 
minus the estimated population mean pl acebo effect at timepoint k (ie, time effect). A decile 
plot, i e, plot of the deciles of observed concentrations and the mean placebo -adjusted ΔQTcF 
(ΔΔQTcF) and 90% CI at the medi an concentration within each decile will be given. The 
regression line presenting the model -predicted ΔΔQTcF7 will be added to evaluate the fit of a 
linear model and visualize the concentration -response relationship. The placebo- adjusted 
ΔQTcF i,j equals the individual ΔQTcF i,j for subject i administered with CBP -307 at timepoint 
j minus the estima tion of time at timepoint j (ie , time effect). Additional exploratory analyses 
(via graphical displays and/or model fitting) will include accounting for a delayed effect 
(hysteresis) and the justification for the choice of PD  model (linear versus nonlinear) as 
follows. 
Criteria for N egative QT A ssessment  
If the upper bound of the 2- sided 90%  CI of the  predicted QTc effect of ΔΔQTcF at the 
observed geometric mean C max on Days  5 and 14 as well as clinically relevant plasma levels 
is below 10 msec (ie,  the upper bound of the 2- sided 90% CI at the geometric mean C max 
<10 msec), it can be concluded that CBP -307 does not cause clinically concerning QT 
prolongation within the observed plasma concentration ranges .  
Investigation of H ysteresis  
Hysteresis will be assessed based on joint graphical displays of the least squares (LS) mean 
ΔΔQTcF for each postbaseline timepoint and the mean concentration of CBP -307 at the same 
timepoints. In addition, hysteresis plots will be given for LS mean ΔΔQTcF and the mean 
concentrat ions. If a QT effect (ΔΔQTcF) > 10 msec cannot be excluded from the by- timepoint 
analysis in the active dose groups on Days 5 and 14; and the mean peak ΔΔQTcF effe ct is 
observed at the same timepoint in t he by- timepoint analysis in the active dose groups on 
Days  5 and 14; and if the difference (delay ) between the time to reach the  peak QT c effect 
(ΔΔQTcF) and peak plasma concentration (t max) in the plot (ΔΔQTcF versus CBP -307) of 
more than 1 hour is observed  in a consisten t way for the active dose groups on Days 5 and 14, 
other concentration -QTc models, such as a model with an effect compartment, may be 
explored. With the provision stated above, hysteresis will be assumed if this curve shows a counterclockwise loop. A significant treatment effect -specific intercept may also be 
indicative of hysteresis  or model misspecification , if it cannot be explained by a nonlinear 
relationship.  
Appropriateness of a L inear M odel 
To assess the appropriateness of a linear model, normal quantile -quantile  plots for the 
standardized residuals and the random effects, scatter  plots of standardized residuals versus 
concentration and versus fitted values , and box plots of standardized residuals versus nominal

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 44 of 64 time and versus active treatment will be produced. The scatter plot of standardized residuals 
versus conc entration by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing  (LOESS)  fitting (ie , locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing8 lines ) also will be produced with an optimal smoothi ng 
parameter selected by the Akaike information criterion with a correction.9 In addition, a 
scatter plot of observed concentration and ΔQTcF with a LOESS smooth line with 90% CI and a linear regression line will also be provided to check the assumption of a linear concentration -QTc relationship. If there is an indication that a linear model is inappropriate, 
additional models may be fitted, such as an E -max model . The concentration- QTc analysis 
will then be repeated for the model found to best accommodate the nonlinearity detected. 
Assay Sensitivity  
Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by simil ar concentration -QTc analysis of 
moxifloxacin data. If the slope of the concentration- QTc (change -from -baseline QTcF) for 
moxifloxacin is statistically significant at 10% level for 2 -sided test and the lower bound of 
the 2- sided 90% CI of the predicted eff ect is above 5 msec at the observed geometric mean 
C
max of the 400- mg dose, assay sensitivity will be deemed to have been demonstrated.  
By-Time point Analysis  
The analysis for QTcF for CBP -307 versus placebo will be based on a linear mixed -effects 
model wit h change -from- baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) as the dependent variable, time (ie , 
postbaseline timepoint s on Days 1, 5, and 14: categorical), treatment (therapeutic dose of 
CBP -307 and supra therapeutic dose of CBP -307 on Day 14, and corresponding placebo), and 
time-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be 
specified fo r the repeated measures at post dose timepoints within subjects. If the model with 
unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices such as 
compound symmetry and autoregressive will be considered. From this analysis, the LS  mean , 
SE, and 2- sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the contrast “CBP -307 versus placebo” for 
each day of Days 1, 5, and 14 at each postbaseline timepoint on Days 1, 5, and Day 14, respectively . 
The by- time point analysis for QTc F will be also performed for moxifloxacin versus placebo 
at post baseline timepoints on Day 1 and Day 15. A linear mixed -effects model will be used 
with ΔQTcF a s the d ependent variable and time (ie, postbaseline timepoint s on Days 1 and 
15: categorical), treatment (moxifloxacin and placebo), sequence (placebo/moxifloxacin or moxifloxacin/placebo), and time -by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. An unstructure d 
covariance matrix will be specified fo r the repeated measures at postbaseline timepoints for 
subject within visit. The model will also include a subject- specific random effect. If the 
model with an unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrices, 
such as compound symmetry or autoregressive, will be considered. From this analysis, the LS mean , SE,  and 2- sided 90% CIs will be calculated for the contrast “moxifloxacin versus 
placebo” at each postbaseline tim epoint , respectively . 
For HR, PR, and QRS intervals, the analysis will be based on the change -from -baseline 
postdose (ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS). The same (by- timepoint analysis) model will be used as 
described for QTcF. The LS mean, SE, and 90% CI from the statistical modeling for both

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021  Page 45 of 64 change -from- baseline and placebo -corrected change -from -baseline values will be listed in the 
tables and graphically displayed.  
Categorical Analyses  
The analysis results for categorical outliers, T -wave morphology, and U -wave presence will 
be summarized in fr equency tables with counts (percentages) for both the number of subjects 
and the number of timepoints. For categorical outliers, the number (percenta ge) of subjects as 
well as time points who had increases  in absolute QTcF values > 450 and ≤480 msec, >480 
and ≤500 msec, or >500 msec, and changes from pre dose base line of >30 and ≤60 msec, or 
>60 msec; increase in PR from pre dose baseline >25% to a PR  > 200 msec; increase in QRS 
from pre dose baseline > 25% to a QRS > 120 msec; decrease in HR from pr edose baseline  
>25% to a n HR < 50 bpm; and increase in HR from pr edose baseline >25% to a n HR 
>100 bpm will be determined. For T -wave morphology and U -wave presence, the analyses 
will be focused on change fr om baseline (ie, treatment- emergent changes).  
8.4. Pharmacokinetic An alyses  
The analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be 
presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics (mean, SD , median, minimum, 
maximum  geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation ) separately  by group . 
Individual and mean plasma CBP -307 and moxifloxacin concentration versus time data will 
be tabulated and plotted by dose level. Graphical displays of PK data may be provided as well.  
For each subject, the following PK parameters will be calculated, whenever possible, based 
on the plasma concentration for CBP -307 and moxifloxacin, according to the model 
independent approach:  
• C
max 
• tmax 
• AUC 0-24  
• AUC inf 
• apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ Z) 
• t1/2  
• apparent total clearance (CL/F)  
• apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V z/F)  
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed, if appropriate, using commercial software such as Phoenix® WinNonlin
® (Version 8.1 or higher).  
Other parameter s may be added as appropriate.

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021   Page 48 of 64 Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subjec t or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including a  clinically significant  abnormal laboratory finding), sympto m, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , whether or not related to the study 
treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that had increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study medication.  
Examples of AEs include:  
• Symptoms described by the subject, or signs observed by the investigator, and 
• Abnormal findings (involving clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, ECG, etc.)  
• Exacerbation of previous condition, including i ncreased incidence and/or severity.  
Note: Regarding decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood in this study, please report them as follows:  
• Since a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood is due to the mechanism of action of the drug, it  is not  to be reported as an AE. However, clinical diagnosis 
related to a decreased lymphocyte count in peripheral blood indicates AE reporting (if no diagnosis is available, it is required to report related clinical symptoms or signs).  
The investigator is to rep ort all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs. All AEs will be recorded in the medical records and eCRFs. The investigator (or designee) is to record in 
detail any AE that occurred to the subject, including: AE diagnosis whenever possible, or signs , symptoms, the start date and time of occurrence, the stop date and tim e of occurrence, 
seriousness (ie, whether it is a n SAE), severity of AEs, causality assessment, actions taken on 
the investigational product, other actions (eg, medications/treatments given), and outcomes of AEs.  
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator  will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE  using the 
following categor ies:  
• Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living.  
• Moderate : Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.

Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021   Page 49 of 64 • Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly  affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . 
Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator  (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study treatment  using a 4-category system according t o the following guidelines:  
• Not Related : The AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study 
procedure/conditions . 
• Unlikely Related : The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that 
the drug is not likely to have any r easonable association with the AE . 
• Possibly Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the 
study procedures/conditions . 
• Related : The AE follows  a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of 
the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause- effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced.  
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Every reasonable effort will be made to follow  up with subjects who have AEs. Any subject 
who has an ongoing AE  that is  possibly related or related to the  IMP  or study procedures at 
the follow -up visit will be followed up, where possible, until resolution or until the 
unresolved AE is judged by the investigator (or designee) to have stabilized . This will be 
completed at the investigator ’s (or designee’s) discretion.  Any subject who has an ongoing 
AE that is not related or unlikely related to the IMP or study procedures at the follow -up visit  
can be closed out as ongoing at the investigator ’s discretion.   
Adverse Drug Reactions 
All noxious and unintended responses to an IMP ( ie, where a causal relationship between an 
IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered 
adverse drug reactions.  
For marketed medicinal  products, a response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and 
which  occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases 
or modification of physiological function is to be considered an adverse drug reaction. 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product inform ation (eg, I B for an unapproved 
IMP).  
Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs will be collected after subjects sign the informed consent form and  throughout the 
entire study, ie , until the e nd-of-study as specified in the protocol (or at early termination).  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021   Page 50 of 64 An SAE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose either:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• results in an important medical event (see below) . 
Important medical events that may not result in death , be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Instances of death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the investigator  at 
any time after cessation of the study treatment and considered by the investigator  to be 
possibly related to the study treatment, will be reported to the sp onsor  (or designee) . 
Definition of Life -threatening  
An AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred (ie, does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious for m). For instance, drug- induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of 
hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis 
can be fatal.  
Definition of Hospitalization  
Adverse events requiring hospitalization should be considered serious. In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that  would not have 
been appropriate at the  study si te. When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or 
was necessary, the AE should be considered as serious.  
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures, which are not the result of an AE, need not be considered A Es and should be recorded on a clinical assessment f orm and 
added to the e CRF . If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, this must be 
reported as an AE and either ‘serious’ or ‘nonserious’ attributed according to the usual criteria.  
Serious Adverse Event R eporting  
The investigator  will complete an SAE report form and forward it by facsimile  or email  to 
Covance APAC Drug Safety  and the sponsor  immediately (within 24  hours) upon becoming 
aware of an SAE.

Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021   Page 51 of 64 All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) to: +61 -2-8879-2000

Covance Safety SAE Reporting Fax Number:  61-2-6100- 9788 or 1800-882- 203 (toll free)  
 
The responsibilities of Covance APAC Drug Safety  include the following:  
• Prepare an AE reporting plan prior to the start of the study. Where this plan differs 
from the applicable study site  standard operating procedure on SAE reporting, the 
safety management pla n will always take precedence.  
• Receive and review SAE report forms from the study site  and inform the sponsor  of 
the SAE within 1 working day of the initial notification to Covance APAC Drug 
Safety  who will delete any information from the SAE report forms that may ident ify 
the subject.  
• Write case narratives and enter the case into Covance’s safety database as defined in the AE reporting plan . 
• Produce appropriate reports of all suspected unexpected serious adverse r eactions and 
forward them to the EC , Medicines and Healthca re Products Regulatory Agency, 
principal investigator, and the sponsor  within the timeframes stipulated in the Clinical 
Trials Directive Guideline (ENTR/CT  3).  
The responsibility for reporting SAEs will be transferred to the sponsor  28 days after the end 
of the study.  
For SAEs, the active reporting period to sponsor or its designated representative begins from the time that the subject provides informed consent through to the last subject  visit.  
Nonserious  AEs should be collected from the time the subject  has taken the placebo dose on 
Day - 1 through the last subject  visit. If AEs that occur in the screening prior to the placebo 
administration to all subjects on Day - 1 are considered to be related to the stu dy procedure, 
they should be also collected.  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  
Each AE is to be assessed to deter mine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, the 
sponsor should be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event. This time 
frame also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded SAE 
reports as w ell as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the  
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his or her first awareness of the AE.  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8463245 Protocol  Reference: CBP -307AU002 
Protocol Version 1.0, 18  March 2021   Page 52 of 64 For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the sponsor in 
accordance with the ti me frames for reporting as specified above. In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by the sponsor to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on 
the AE e CRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow 
for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the sponsor or its designated representative.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy (mater nal or paternal exposure to study treatment) does not meet the definition of 
an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. 
If the fema le subject becomes pregnant during the clinical trial and has not yet been dosed 
with study treatment, she must be withdrawn from the study. If the female subject becomes 
pregnant during the clinical trial and has been dosed, she must discontinue treatment 
immediately  but may remain on study for safety evaluations . If the partner of a male subject 
becomes pregnant during the clinical trial, the subject can continue the clinical trial.  
For pregnancy of female subjects or partners of the male subjects during this study, investigators should report to the sponsor or designee in a pregnancy report form within 24 hours after investigator awareness and report to the EC  in time as per local requirement.  
The investigator will follow up on pregnancy outcomes, until  not less than 12 months  after 
birth, unless otherwise justified , and will report the outcome to the s ponsor and e thics 
committee.  
If any adverse pregnancy outcome (eg, the outcome of the  pregnancy is stillbirth, 
spontaneous abortion, or fetal malformations ), it should be considered as an SAE and be 
reported in accordance with SAE reporting requirements.

Definitions  
Women of Childbearing Potential: premenopausal females who are anatomically and 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant following menarche.  
Women of Non childbearing  Potential:  
1. Surgically sterile:  females who are permanently sterile via hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy , and/or bilateral oophorectomy by reported medical 
history and/or medical records. Surgical sterilization to have occurred a minimum of 6 weeks , or at the investigator ’s discret ion, prior to screening . 
2. Postmenopausal: f emales at least 45 years of age with amenorrhea for 12 months 
without an alternative medical reason with confirmatory follicle -stimulating 
hormone (FSH) levels of ≥40 mIU/mL. The amenorrhea should not be induced by 
a medical condition such as anorexia nervosa, hypothyroid disease or polycystic 
ovarian disease, or by extreme exercise. It should not be due to concomitant medications that may have induced the amenorrhea such as oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotrop in-releasing hormones, anti -estrogens, or selective estrogen 
receptor modulators. Females on hormone replacement therapy with FSH levels <40 mIU/mL may be included at the discretion of the investigator.   
Fertile male: a male that is considered fertile aft er puberty.  
Infertile male: permanently sterile male via bilateral orchiectomy.  
Contraception Guidance  
Female Subjects  
Female subjects who are of nonchildbearing potential will not be required to use contraception. Female subjects of childbearing potential  must be willing to use 2 methods 
(1 primary and 1 secondary method) of birth control from the time of signing the ICF  until 
90 days after the follow -up visit. Primary (non- barrier) methods of contraception include:  
• surgical method performed at least 3 months prior to the screening  visit:  
o bilateral tubal ligation  or bilateral salpingectomy  
o Essure
® (hysteroscopic bilateral tubal occlusion) with confirmation of 
occlusion of the fallopian tubes  
• non-hormonal intrauterine device  or Mirena® (other hormonal intrauterine devices 
will not be allowed) in place for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of the study 
drug 
• vasectomized male partner (sterilization performed at least 90 days  prior to the 
screening  visit, with verb al confirmation of surgical success, and the sole partner for 
the female subject)

Female subjects of childbearing potential should refrain from donation of ova from check -in 
(Day - 2) until 90 days after the follow -up visit.  
Male Subjects  
Male subjects (even with  a history of vasectomy) with partners of childbearing potential must 
use a male barrier method of contraception (ie, male condom without  spermicide) in addition 
to a second method of acceptable contraception from check -in until 90 days after the 
follow -up visit. Acceptable methods of contraception for female partners include:  
• hormonal injection  
• combined oral contraceptive pill  or progestin/progestogen- only pill  
• combined hormonal patch 
• combined hormonal vaginal ring  
• surgical method (bilateral tubal ligation  or Essure® [hysteroscopic bilateral tubal 
occlusion])  
• hormonal implant  
• hormonal or non- hormonal intrauterine device  
• cervical cap with out spermicide  
• diaphragm without  spermicide . 
An acceptable second method of contraception for male subjects is vasectomy that has been 
performed at least 90 days prior to the screening visit with verbal confirmation of surgical success.  
For male subjects (even with a history of vasectomy), sexual intercourse with female partners 
who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be av oided unless condoms are used from the time 
of the first dose until 90 days after the follow -up visit. Male subjects are required to refrain 
from donation of sperm from check -in until 90 days after the follow -up visit.  
Sexual Abstinence and Same -sex Relationships  
Subjects who practice true abstinence, because of the subject’s lifestyle choice (ie, the subject should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation), are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a

Prior to starting participation in the study, each subject will be provided with a study -specific 
ICF giving details of the study treatment s, procedures, and potential risks of the study. 
Subjects will be instructed that they are free to obtain further information from the 
investigator  (or designee) and that their participation is voluntary and they are free to 
withdraw from the study at any time.  Subjects will be given an opportunity to ask questions 
about the study prior to providing consent for participation.  
Following the discussion of the study with study site  personnel, subjects will sign the ICF in 
the presence of a suitably trained member of staff to indicate that they are freely giving their informed consent. A  copy of the ICF will be given to the subject.  
Subjects must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their 
participation in the study.  
Subject Data Prote ction 
Subjects will be assigned a unique identifier and will not be identified by name in eCRFs, study- related forms, study reports, or any related publications. Subject and investigator  
personal data will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In the 
event the study protocol, study report, or study data are included in a public registry, all 
identifiable information from individual subjects or inve stigato rs will be redacted according 
to applicable laws and regulations.  
The subject must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
sponsor  in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be

1. Subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinical site in the afternoon 2 days before start of dosing  on Day 1 (Day -2).  
2. Discharge from unit will occur after the 24 -hour PK samples and after comp letion of safety assessments on  Day 16. 
3. Screening  and Check -in on Day -2:  Tympanic temperature, respiratory rate, and supine pulse rate and blood pressure. Other days  (except for Day 16) : Prior to and 
2 hours after dosing , supine vital signs ( tympanic temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) . Discharge (Day 16) : Prior to discharge, supine vital signs 
(tympanic temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure).  End of Study/Follow -up Visit (Day 28±2 days) : Tympanic temperature, respiratory rat e, and 
supine pulse rate and blood pressure.  
4. 12-lead safety ECG will be recorded in triplicates before dosing and in singles 2 hours postdos e on all study days and before discharge on Day 16. Postdos e safety will be 
interpreted on -site by the investigator and may be repeated to confirm/refute clinically abnormal findings.  
5. Continuous cardiodynamic monitoring (Holter) will be performed for 25 hours on Day -1 (baseline), 1, 5, 14, and 15. The recording will be started at least 1 hour before 
dosing and at the corresponding clock time on Day -1. Replicate 12-lead ECGs will be extracted from the continuous recording prior to dosing ( -30 minutes) and 0.5, 1, 
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 , and 24 hours postdos e on each day. At timepoint s for ECG extractions, subjects will be s upinely resting in an undisturbed environment. When timepoint s 
for ECG extraction, safety ECGs, vital signs assessment , and blood draws coincide, procedures will be performed in this order . The ECG effects of CBP -307 will be 
tested on data from Day - 1 (baseline for both groups), Day  5 (therapeutic concentrations versus placebo) , and Day 14 (supratherapeutic concentrations versus placebo). 
Assay sensitivity with moxifloxacin will be tested on data from Days - 1, 1, 14 , and 15.  
6. Serum pregnancy test will be per formed at screening  and urine pregnancy test s will be performed  on Day -2 and at the follow -up visit (Day 28±2 days) . A positive urine 
pregnancy test will be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  
7. Pharmacokinetic samplings will be performed prior to dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing on each PK s ampling day (Days 1, 5, 14, and 15) . 
8. Allowable assessment/sample collection windows are  as follows: ±2  minutes for 0.5 h ours postdose , ±5 minutes for 1 to 4 hours postdose , ±10  minutes f or 6 to 8 hours 
postdose , and ±30 minutes  for 12 to 24  hours postdose .

Title  of Study:  A Multicenter,  Randomized, Active -Controlled  Study  to Evaluate  the Efficacy  and Safety  of 
EXPAREL  When  Administered  via Infiltration  into the Transversus  Abdominis  Plane  versus  Standard  of Care  in 
Subjects  Undergoing  Elective  Cesarean  Section  (CHOICE)  
Principal  investigator:  To be determined  
Study  Center(s):  Multicenter  study  in North  America  
Publications  (Reference):  None  
Objectives:  
Primary  objective : To compare  total opioid  consumption  through  72 hours  following  EXPAREL  infiltration  into the 
transversus  abdominis  plane  (TAP)  with standard  of care (SOC)  in subjects  undergoing  an elective  cesarean  section  
(C-section).  
Secondary  objective : To assess  efficacy  and safety  parameters  and participant  satisfaction.  
Methodology:  
This is a Phase  4, multicenter,  randomized,  active -controlled  study  in approximately  182 adult  subjects  undergoing  
elective  C-section.  All subjects  will remain  in the hospital  for up to 72 hours  postsurgery.  
Obtaining  Informed  Consent  
Potential  participants  may provide  informed  consent  up to 30 days before  their scheduled  surgery.  If a subject  can 
only be screened  on the day of surgery,  the consent  process  should  be started  at least 24 hours  prior  to the day of 
surgery  in order  to ensure  ample  time for the subject  to review  the informed  consent  form  (ICF)  and have all her 
questions  answered  by the investigator/study  staff prior  to providing  informed  consent.  Screening  procedures  that are 
SOC  at the institution  may be completed  prior  to written  informed  consent.  Any screening  procedures  that are not 
SOC  must  be completed  after written  informed  consent  is provided  and prior  to surgery.  
Screening  
Subjects  will be screened within  30 days prior  to surgery;  screening  on the day of surgery  will be allowed  but is 
discouraged.  If a subject  can only be screened  on the day of surgery,  the informed  consent  process  must  still be  
started  at least 24 hours  prior  to the conduct  of any screening  procedures  that are not considered  SOC  at the institution  
and such procedures  may not be performed  until written  informed  consent  is provided.  All screening  procedures  that 
are not SOC  must  be performed  and documented within  the 30-day time window  (inclusive  of the day of surgery  for 
those  subjects  who can only be screened  on the day of surgery)  as described  here.  During  the screening  visit,  subjects  
will be assessed  for any past or present  medical  conditions  that, in the opinion  of the investigator,  would  preclude  them  
from  study  participation.  
After  the ICF is signed,  medical  history,  surgical  history,  physical  examination  (according  to the investigational  site’s  
SOC),  12-lead electrocardiogram,  vital sign measurements,  alcohol  breath  test and urine  drug screen,  and clinical  
laboratory  tests (hematology  and chemistry)  will be performed.  The Surgical  Fear Questionnaire  (SFQ)  will be 
administered  during  screening.

steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  [NSAIDs])  is prohibited.  
On Day 1, prior  to the C-section,  pulse  oximetry  will be measured  and eligible  subjects  will be randomized  in a 1:1:1  
ratio into one of the three  treatment  groups  listed  below:  
• Group  1: 150 mcg Duramorph® (SOC  arm).  No EXPAREL  TAP  infiltration  following  skin-incision  
closure.  
Subjects  randomized  to Group  1 will receive  an intrathecal  injection  of 150 mcg preservative -free morphine  
for spinal  injection  (e.g.,  Duramorph)  in conjunction  with single -shot spinal  anesthesia  using  1.4 to 1.6 mL 
bupivacaine  hydrochloride  (HCl)  0.75%  and 15 mcg fentanyl.  Postoperative  pain management  will follow  
the multimodal  pain regimen  as defined  in this protocol..  
• Group  2: 50 mcg Duramorph  + EXPAREL  TAP  infiltration  following skin -incision  closure  + postoperative  
multimodal  pain regimen  as defined  in this protocol.  
Subjects  randomized  to Group  2 will receive  an intrathecal  injection  of 50 mcg preservative -free morphine  
for spinal  injection  (e.g.,  Duramorph)  in conjunction  with single -shot spinal  anesthesia  using  1.4 to 1.6 mL 
bupivacaine  HCl 0.75%.  If deemed  necessary  by the investigator,  intrathecal  fentanyl  can be given  prior  to 
incision  for the C-section.  If intrathecal  fentanyl  is used,  the dose of 15 mcg fentanyl,  date,  and time of the 
usage  must  be recorded.  In addition,  Group  2 subjects  will receive  EXPAREL  TAP  infiltration  following  
skin-incision  closure  plus postoperative  multimodal  pain regimen.  
• Group  3: EXPAREL  TAP  infiltration  following  skin-incision  closure  + postoperative  multimodal  pain 
regimen  as defined  in this protocol.  No Duramorph.  
Subjects  randomized  to Group  3 will NOT  receive  Duramorph  as a spinal  injection.  This group  will receive  
single -shot spinal  anesthesia  using  1.4 to 1.6 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.75%.  If deemed  necessary  by the 
investigator,  intrathecal  fentanyl  can be given  prior  to incision  for the C-section.  If intrathecal  fentanyl  is 
used,  the dose of 15 mcg fentanyl,  date,  and time of the usage  must  be recorded.  In addition,  Group  3 
subjects  will receive  EXPAREL  TAP  infiltration  following skin-incision  closure  plus postoperative  
multimodal  pain regimen.  
In all treatment  groups,  a combined  spinal  epidural  (CSE)  anesthesia  technique  may also be used provided  the epidural  
component  is not used.  Subjects  who receive  the epidural  component  of the CSE anesthesia  must  be immediately  
withdrawn  from  the study.

Study Schema  
 
 
TAP=transversus  abdominis  plane  
 
Intraoperative  medications:  The intraoperative  use of ketamine  and midazolam  (Versed®) is discouraged  but may be 
permitted  if clinically  indicated  based  on the investigator’s  discretion  (all medications  must  be appropriately  recorded  
[i.e., drug,  dose,  and route  of administration]).  Prophylactic  use of dexamethasone  for prevention  of nausea  and 
vomiting  is prohibited.  
For Groups  2 and 3, after delivery  of the baby  and prior  to the TAP  infiltration,  a small  amount  of lidocaine  (<2 mL) 
may be administered  subcutaneously  to form  a skin wheal  over the area of the needle  insertion  site. A 2-point  classic  
TAP  block,  in 2 steps  (see Pharmacy  Binder),  must  be performed  under  ultrasound  guidance  and must  be performed   
no more  than 90 minutes  after skin-incision  closure  of the C-section.  A confirmatory  ultrasound image  or video will  
be taken  of each side of the abdomen  after the TAP  needle  position  has been  established  and following  infiltration  of 
study  drug.  
TAP  infiltration  (Groups  2 and 3): The TAP  infiltration  includes  two steps:  (1) TAP  needle  placement  and saline  
hydrodissection  and (2) study  drug mixture  infiltration  into the TAP.  Each  step must  be performed  on one side of the 
abdomen  and must  be repeated  on the contralateral  side to complete  the bilateral,  2-point  TAP  required  for the study.  
For complete,  step-by-step instructions  on performing  the TAP  infiltration  under  ultrasound  guidance,  please  refer to 
the Pharmacy  Binder.

Postsurgical  Analgesia:  Participant -controlled  analgesia  is not permitted.  
The following  multimodal  pain regimens  will be used for all treatment  groups.  The date,  time,  and dose of all 
standardized  multimodal  pain medications  administered  must  be recorded.  
All Subjects  in Groups  1, 2, and 3: 
At the time of skin-incision  closure  (Note:  it is very important  that these  be administered  at the time of skin-incision  
closure  and not prior  to or before  the end of surgery):  
• Intravenous  (IV) ketorolac  30 mg (1 dose)  
• IV acetaminophen  1000  mg (1 dose)  
Beginning  6 hours  after skin-incision  closure:  
• IV ketorolac  30 mg beginning  6 hours  from  the administration  of IV ketorolac  at the time of skin-incision  
closure  and then every  6 hours  (q6h)  for the next 18 hours  (i.e., total of 120 mg as four 30-mg doses  over first 
24 hours  from  the time of skin-incision  closure)  
• IV acetaminophen  1000  mg beginning  6 hours  from  the administration  of IV acetaminophen  at the time of 
skin-incision  closure  and then every  6 hours  (q6h)  for the next 18 hours  (i.e., total of 4000  mg as four 1000 - 
mg doses  over first 24 hours  from  the time of skin-incision  closure)  
• Scheduled  oral (PO)  Tylenol® (acetaminophen)  975 mg beginning  6 hours  from  the administration  of the last 
dose of IV acetaminophen  and q6h for up to 72 hours  or hospital  discharge  (whichever  occurs  first)  
• Scheduled  PO ibuprofen  600 mg beginning  6 hours  from  the administration  of the last dose of IV ketorolac  
and then q6h for up to 72 hours  or hospital  discharge  (whichever  occurs  first)  
This multimodal  pain regimen  is a requirement  for all subjects  in the study  and is not subject  to investigator  
discretion.  The date,  time,  and dose of all standardized  multimodal  pain medications  administered  must  be recorded.  
Note:  The scheduled  PO medication  will be administered  on a q6h schedule  only till hospital  discharge.  
Rescue  Medication : When  breakthrough  pain occurs,  the study  staff or the floor  nurses  on duty will need to ensure  
that the study  subject  is strictly  following  the protocol -specific  multimodal  pain regimen  schedule  (q6h as defined  in 
the protocol)  before  considering  the use of the opioids  as a rescue,  especially  in cases  where  the visual  analog  scale  
(VAS)  score  is relatively  low. Subjects  should  receive  opioid  rescue  pain medication  only upon  request  for 
breakthrough  pain.  
Postsurgical  rescue  medication  will comprise  PO immediate -release  oxycodone  (initiated  at 5 mg as needed  [PRN]).  If 
the 5 mg oxycodone  is not sufficient  for pain management,  subject  can receive  a dose of 10 mg PRN.  If a subject  is 
unable  to tolerate  PO medication  or fails the PO oxycodone  rescue,  IV morphine  (initiated  at 1 to 2 mg) or 
hydromorphone  (initiated  at 0.3 to 0.5 mg) may be administered  PRN.  
All surgical  and postsurgical  opioid  and other  analgesics  (pain  medications)  administered  must  be documented  
through  Day 14 postsurgery.  Additionally,  an unscheduled  pain intensity  score  using  a 10 cm VAS  (see Appendix  1) 
must  be completed  immediately  prior  to any rescue  medication  while  in the hospital.  
Permitted  medications  for the prevention  and treatment  of possible adverse  events  (AEs)  of medications  include  the 
following  (to be used at the discretion  of the study  site principal  investigator):  
• Ondansetron  4 mg IV immediately  after delivery  of the baby  
• Ondansetron  4 mg IV (should  not exceed  a maximum  of 12 mg in a 24-hour period)  for intraoperative  and 
postoperative  nausea  and vomiting

• Naloxone  IV 50 to 100 mcg PRN  for pruritus  
Postsurgical  Assessments  
Subjects  will remain  in the hospital  for up to 72 hours  after surgery.  Postsurgical  assessments  will include:  
• Opioid  use • Date  and time to first bowel  movement  
-Total  opioid  burden  • Itching  using  Numeric  Rating  Scale  (NRS)  of 0 to 10 (see 
-Time  to first opioid  use Appendix  10) 
• Date  and time of first unassisted  ambulation  • Subject's  satisfaction  with postsurgical  pain control  
• Pain intensity  scores  using  a 10 cm VAS  (see Appendix  3) 
(see Appendix  1) at rest (general  and site of • Recovery  from  Cesarean  Section  scale  (RCSS;  
injection)   see Appendix  4) 
• Discharge  readiness  (see Appendix  2) • Calls  to physician  about  pain (see Appendix  8) 
• Opioid  Related  Symptom  Distress  scale  • Total  time in post-anesthesia  care unit (PACU)  
(ORSDS;  see Appendix  7) • Persistent  opioid  use at Day 30 (see Appendix  9) 
• Emergency  department  visits  
While  in the hospital , subjects  will be provided  with an electronic  patient -reported  outcome  (ePRO)  device  and will 
use the device  to record  all scheduled  and unscheduled  VAS  scores.  For all scheduled  assessments  and unscheduled  
assessments  in the hospital,  subjects  will assess  “How  much  pain are you experiencing  right  now in general?”  and 
“How  much  pain are you experiencing  at the site of the incision”;  a vertical  mark  will be placed  on the VAS  line to 
indicate  the level  of pain experienced  at the time of assessment.  If a subject  is discharged  prior  to a scheduled  VAS  
assessment,  a member  of the study  site staff will contact  the subject  to remind  her to complete  the scheduled  VAS  
assessment  at the scheduled  time and to record  the assessment  in the device,  which  the subjects  will take home  with 
them  to continue  to record  study  assessments  at home.  
At hospital  discharge,  the subject will be instructed  to record  in the device  their daily  pain intensity  score  (VAS)  and 
all pain medications  taken  following  hospital  discharge  through  Day 14. 
At home,  the subject  will assess  pain intensity  at rest each day at noon  (± 4 hours).  This assessment  should  capture  
her worst  pain at rest in the prior  24 hours by assessing  “What was your worst  pain since your  last pain assessment?”  
(i.e., from  noon  on the previous  day to the current  assessment).  At the same  time,  the subject  should  record  any pain 
medication  (medication  name,  date,  time,  and dose)  taken  in the prior  24 hours.  
A phone  call will be made  to each subject  on Day 14 for safety  purposes  and to inquire  as to whether  the subject  has 
made  any unscheduled  phone  calls or office  visits  related  to pain,  experienced  any hospital  readmission,  or 
experienced  an emergency  room  visit since  hospital  discharge.  AEs and serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  will be 
recorded  from  the time the ICF is signed  through  Day 14. Any concomitant  medications  to treat AEs through  Day 14 
will also be recorded.  On Day 30, a phone  call will be made to ask the subjects  about  persistent  opioid  use. 
Number  of Subjects  (Planned) : Approximately  182 subjects  are planned  for enrollment  into the study.  Subjects  who 
are withdrawn  or discontinued  prior  to completing  the study  may be replaced.

Name:  Duramorph® (150 mcg);  Institutional  site SOC  
Duration  of Subject  Participation  in Study:  
Participation  will begin  upon  signing  of the ICF. No more  than 30 days should  pass between  signing  the ICF and 
surgery.  The time from  study  drug administration  through  the end of participation  is 30 ± 3 days.  Therefore,  each 
subject  may participate  in the study  for a maximum  of 66 days.  
Efficacy  Assessments:  
The following  efficacy  measurements  will be performed  at the times  specified  after closure  of the C-section  skin 
incision:  
• Date  and time of administration,  and amount  of all postsurgical  opioid  rescue  medication  taken  through  Day 14 
• Pain intensity  scores  at rest (general  and at incision  site) using  a 10 cm VAS  at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours  after 
surgery  (see Appendix  1) and then once  daily  (at noon  ± 4 hours)  through  Day 14 
Note  1: For pain intensity  scores  at 12, 24, 48, or 72 hours,  if the subject  is sleeping,  do not wake  her to assess  
pain.  If she awakens  within  the assessment  window  (i.e., 1 hour for the 12- and 24-hour assessments,  2 hours  
for the 48-hour assessments,  and 4 hours  for the 72-hour assessments),  a pain score  may be collected  then.  
Note  2: An unscheduled  VAS  score  is also required  immediately  prior  to administration  of any rescue  
medication  while  in the hospital.  
Note  3: If a subject  is discharged  prior  to any of the scheduled  VAS  assessments  to be collected  at 12 to 
72 hours  after surgery,  a member  of the study  site staff will telephone  the subject  at the appropriate  scheduled  
times  (i.e., the time of each assessment  scheduled  to be collected  that occurs  after hospital  discharge)  to remind  
her to complete  the VAS  and to record  the scheduled  assessments  in the ePRO  device.  This will ensure  that, for  
any subjects  discharged  prior  to 72 hours,  all VAS  assessments  required  for calculation  of the study  endpoints  
are captured.  These  phone  calls will only occur  if a subject  is discharged  prior  to 72 hours.

signs  (blood  pressure,  heart  rate, respiratory  rate, and temperature)  and pulse  oximetry  will be monitored  and recorded.  
Safety  Endpoints:  
Incidence  of treatment -emergent  AEs and SAEs  will be assessed  from  the start of anesthesia  through  Day 14. 
Statistical  Methods:  
A comprehensive  statistical  analysis  plan (SAP)  will be developed  for this study.  Demographic  and baseline  
characteristics  will be summarized  descriptively  by treatment  group  for all subjects  who receive  study  drug.  Efficacy  
and safety  endpoint  analyses  will be described  in the SAP.  
Determination  of Sample  Size:  
Assuming  a log-normal  distribution  for total opioid  consumption  with a 70% coefficient  of variation,  5% alpha,  an 
equal  randomization  ratio,  and 80% power,  a total of 77 subjects  per treatment  group  will be sufficient  to detect  a 
25% reduction  in total opioid  consumption.  Assuming  5% of the subjects  are not evaluable  and one of the two 
EXPAREL  groups  will be dropped  after interim  analysis  when  a total of 60 subjects  are treated,  a total sample  size of 
approximately  182 treated  subjects  is needed.  This sample  size will be re-evaluated  after the interim  analysis.  
After  approximately  20 subjects  per treatment  group  are randomized  and treated  (i.e., a total of 60 patients  are treated  
in this study),  an interim  analysis  will be conducted  to evaluate  and compare  the clinical  efficacy/safety  and health  
economics  benefits  between  the two EXPAREL  groups  against  the SOC  control  group.  The primary  purpose of  this 
interim  analysis  is to select  one EXPAREL  treatment  group  out of the two EXPAREL  treatment  groups  to continue  for 
the rest of this study.  The second  purpose  of this interim  analysis  is to evaluate  the sample  size assumptions  and the 
selection  of the primary/secondary  endpoints.  Full details  on the planned  or additional  interim  analysis  will be covered  
in a prospective  interim  analysis  plan.

1. Potential  participants  may provide  informed  consent up  to 30 days before their scheduled  surgery.   If a subject  can only be screened  on the day of surgery,  the consent process  
must  be started  at least 24 hours prior to the day of surgery in order  to ensure  ample  time for the subject  to review  the ICF and have all  her questions answered  by the 
investigator/study  staff prior to providing informed  consent.  Screening procedures  that are SOC at the institution  may be completed  prior to written  informed  consent.  Any 
screening procedures that are not  SOC, must  be completed  after written  informed  consent is provided  and prior to surgery.  
If a subject  can only be screened  on the day of surgery,  the informed  consent  process must  still be  started  at least 24 hours  prior to  the conduct  of any screening  procedures  
that are not  considered SOC at the institution  and such procedures  may not be  performed  until written  informed  consent is  provided.  
2. Vital signs  at screening will  include height,  weight,  blood pressure,  heart  rate, respiratory  rate, and temperature.  
3. At 72 hours  postsurgery  or prior  to hospital  discharge,  whichever  occurs first. 
4. Clinical  laboratory  tests will be conducted  in accordance with  the investigator’s  SOC, including direct  bilirubin; either  gamma -glutamyl  transpeptidase  and lactate  
dehydrogenase  or alanine  transaminase and aspartate transaminase;  and either  serum  creatinine or  blood urea nitrogen.  
5. To assess pain intensity  (VAS)  general  and at incision  site at rest, the subject  should  rest quietly  in a supine  or seated  position  that does not exacerbate  her postsurgical  pain 
for 3-5 minutes before entering  the pain score.  This assessment  should not  be completed  immediately following assessment  of ambulation.  
6. If a subject  is discharged  prior to any of the scheduled  VAS  assessments  (general and  at incision  site) to be collected  at 12 to 72 hours  after surgery,  a member  of the study  
site staff will contact  the subject  at the appropriate scheduled  times  (i.e., the time of each assessment  scheduled  to be collected  that occurs after hospital  discharge)  to remind  
her to  complete the VAS  and ORSDS  assessments  and to record  the scheduled  assessments  in the device.   This will ensure  that, for any subject  discharged  prior  to 72 hours,  
all VAS  and ORSDS  assessments  required  for calculation of the study  endpoints are  captured.  These phone  calls will only be made  if a subject  is discharged  prior to  
72 hours.

7. For pain intensity  scores  at 12, 24, 48, or 72 hours,  if the subject  is sleeping,  do not wake  her to  assess  pain.  If she awakens  within  the assessment  window  (i.e., 1 hour for the 
12- and 24 -hour assessments,  2 hours for the 48-hour assessments,  and 4 hours for the 72-hour assessments),  a pain score may  be collected  then.  
8. Subjects should  only receive opioid  pain medication  (e.g.,  morphine,  hydromorphone  [Dilaudid],  oxycodone) upon  request  for breakthrough  pain.  
9. Discharge readiness  will be assessed  at 24, 48, and 72 hours,  or hospital  discharge,  or until the subject  attains  score  of 9, whichever  occurs first. 
10. Pulse  oximetry measured  once  prior to  surgery  and per your site’s  SOC from  surgery  end up to 24 hours.  
11. Assess vital  signs  (blood  pressure,  heart  rate, respiratory  rate, and temperature)  and itching in PACU  prior  to PACU  discharge.  
Note: No  more than 30 days should  pass between  signing  of the ICF and performance  of the surgery.   Screening on  the day of surgery will  be permitted  but is  discouraged.  
Note: The end of surgery  is defined  as the time of skin-incision  closure of the C-section  wound  (following delivery  and prior  to TAP infiltration).

7. INTRODUCTION  
7.1. Indication  
EXPAREL® was developed to extend pain relief  with a  single -dose administration  without the  
use of indwelling  catheters and to decrease the requirement  for supplemental opioid medications.  
EXPAREL  is indicated  for single -dose infiltration  in adults to produce postsurgical  local  
analgesia  and as an interscalene  brachial plexus nerve  block to produce  postsurgical  regional  
analgesia.  
Effective postsurgical  pain control  is a critical  element in patient recovery  following  surgery,  
as the majority  of patients  may experience significant  pain, particularly  in the first few days.  
Improved  postsurgical  pain management  contributes to better  healing,  faster patient  mobilization,  
shortened  hospital stays,  and reduced  healthcare costs  (American  Society  of Anesthesiologists  
Task  Force on Pain Management  1995) . 
7.2. Current  Therapies/Treatments  
Current  modalities  of postoperative analgesia  include  wound infiltration  with local  anesthetics  
combined  with the  systemic  administration  of analgesics  (multimo dal therapy).   Multimodal  
therapy  usually  includes  opioid medications,  which  have considerable  drawbacks, including  time 
and resources  required  for monitoring  opioid -related  side effects.  A reduction in the  use of 
postoperative opioids is desirable  to decrease the incidence  and severity  of opioid -induced  
adverse  events  (AEs), such as respiratory  depression, nausea,  vomiting,  constipation,  
somnolence,  pruritus,  and urinary  retention.  
With over 70 million surgeries  performed  annually  in the  US, postoperative pain  is a ubiquitous  
condition  among  the US population.  While  it is a predictable  component  of the postoperative  
process,  such pain is often poorly  managed,  resulting  in clinical  and physiological  changes  that 
increase morbidity  and mortality  (inability  to ambulate  early,  etc.),  diminish quality  of life, 
and extend length  of stay, thereby  increasing  hospital expenditures  (Oderda  2007)  and reducing  
patient  satisfaction.   Effective  relief  of acute pain  with minimal opioid complications,  on the  
other  hand,  may improve clinical  outcomes,  avoid  complications  (like delay  in regaining  bowel  
function  or an inability  to tolerate  liquid and solid oral [PO]  intake,  etc.),  and conserve  healthcare  
resources.   As such,  the Joint Commission  on Accreditation  of Healthcare  Organizations  requires  
that all healthcare facilities  practice adequate  pain management  and monitor opioid -related AEs  
(Apfelbaum  2003) . 
Opioid analges ics have  long been established  to be the most effective agents used for the 
management  of moderate  to severe  postoperative pain and are currently  considered  the mainstay  
of treatment.   Opioid -only regimens  are common  and intravenous  (IV) patient -controlled  
analgesia  is a widely  used delivery  system  for morphine  sulfate.   AEs related  to opioid  
administration  (e.g.,  nausea, vomiting,  ileus,  confusion); however,  represent  one important  
reason  that there  is a need to develop  opioid -sparing  strategies.   Indeed,  fear of gastrointestinal

AEs,  such as nausea  and vomiting,  as well as respiratory  depression,  present major  limitations  
for the widespread  use of opioid analgesics  (Chernin 2001  and Viscusi  2009) .  Furthermore,  
management  of opioid -related  AEs often  requires  medical  attention (e.g.,  opioid antagonists,  
antiemetic  agents)  and increased  pharmacy/nursing  time, which  may raise healthcare expenses  
(Carroll  1994) . 
7.3. EXPAREL  (Bupivacaine  Liposome  Injectable  Suspension)  
Bupivacaine is one of  the longer -acting  local anesthetics;  however, it has a limited duration  
of action  after local  administration,  usually less than 8 hours.  EXPAREL  (Pacira  
Pharmaceuticals,  Inc., Parsippany,  New Jersey)  is a bupivacaine liposome  injectable suspension.  
It consists  of microscopic  spherical,  multivesicular  liposomes  (DepoFoam® drug delivery  
system)  organized  in a honeycomb -like structure  comprising  numerous  non-concentric  internal  
aqueous  chambers  containing  a bupivacaine  base at a concentration  of 13.3 mg/mL.   Each  
chamber  is separated  from adjacent  chambers  by lipid membranes.  The lipids (phospholipids,  
cholester ol, and triglycerides)  are naturally  occurring  or close  analogs  of endogenous  lipids.  
Bupivacaine  is slowly  released  from the DepoFoam  particles  by a complex  mechanism  involving  
reorganization  of the barrier  lipid membranes  and subsequent  diffusion  of the  drug over an 
extended  period  of time.  
7.4. Summary  of Human  Experience  with EXPAREL  
Pacira  has conducted more  than 36 clinical  studies  and one observational  follow -up study  to 
investigate  EXPAREL.   Across  these  studies,  over 1800  human subjects  received  EXPAREL  at 
doses  ranging  from  2 mg to 665  mg (equivalent  to 2 mg  to 750 mg  bupivacaine  hydrochloride  
[HCl]) administered  by various routes:  local  infiltration into the surgical  site, subcutaneous,  
perineural  (or nerve  block), and epidural .  EXPAREL  has been  generally  well tolerated  and, in 
active comparator  studies, AEs occurred  at a similar  rate as  the corresponding  bupivacaine  HCl 
controls.  
EXPAREL  was initially  approved  by the US FDA  in 2011 for  single -dose administration  into the  
surgical  site to produce postsurgical  analgesia.   The indication  was amended and approved  by the 
US FDA in 2018 to read:  “EXPAREL  is indicated  for single -dose infiltration in adults to  
produce postsurgical  local analgesia and  as an interscalene brachial  plexus block  to produce  
postsurgical  regional  analgesi a.” Since  its approval,  EXPAREL  has been administered  to over  
4 million patients in the  US. 
Following  the initial approval  of EXPAREL,  numerous  clinical  studies  were  conducted  in whi ch 
EXPAREL  was administered  via various routes  of administration,  including  infiltration  into the  
transversus  abdominis  plane (TAP)  (Sternlicht  2014, Feierman  2014) .

9. OVERALL  STUDY  DESIGN AND  PLAN  
9.1. Study Design  
This is a  Phase 4, multicenter,  randomized,  active -controlled  study  in approximately  182 adult  
subjects.   Subjects  who are  withdrawn  or discontinued  prior  to completing  the study  may be 
replaced.  
Obtaining Informed  Consent  
Potential participants  may provide informed  consent  up to 30 days before  their scheduled  
surgery.   If a subject  can only be screened  on the day  of surgery,  the consent process  must be  
started  at least 24 hours prior to the  day of surgery  in order  to ensure ample  time for the subject  
to review the ICF and have  all her questions  answered  by the investigator/study  staff prior  to 
providing  informed  consent.  Screening  procedures that are SOC at the institution may  be 
completed  prior  to written informed  consent.   Any screening  procedures  that are not SOC must  
be completed  after written informed  consent  is provided and prior  to surgery (see  Section 13.3). 
Screening  
Subjects  will be screened  within  30 days prior  to surgery;  screening  on the  day of surgery  will be  
allowed  but is discouraged.   If a subject  can only be screened  on the day of surgery,  the informed  
consent  process  must still be started  at least 24 hours prior  to the  conduct  of any screening  
procedures  that are  not considered  SOC at the institution and such procedures  may not be  
performed  until written  informed consent  is provided.  All screening  procedures  that are  not SOC  
must be  performed  and documented within the  30-day time window  (inclusive of  the day of 
surgery  for those  subjects who can only be screen ed on the day of surgery)  as described  here.  
During  the screening  visit, subjects will be  assessed for  any past or present  medical  conditions  
that, in the  opinion of  the investigator,  would preclude  them from  study  participation.  
After  the ICF is signed,  medical  history,  surgical  history,  physical  examination  (according  to the  
investigational  site’s  SOC ), 12-lead electrocardiogram,  vital sign measurements, alcohol  breath  
test and urine  drug screen,  and clinical  laboratory  tests (hematology  and chemistry)  will be  
performed.   The Surgical  Fear Questionnaire (SFQ)  will be  administered  during  screening.  
Day of Surgery  
Pre-operative medications: Use of pre-operative  analgesics  (e.g., opioid medications,  Tylenol® 
(acetaminophen),  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  [NSAIDs]) is  prohibited.  
On Day  1, prior  to the  C-section, pulse  oximetry  will be  measured  and eligible subjects  will be  
randomized  in a 1:1:1 ratio into one  of the  three treatment  groups  listed below:  
• Group  1: 150 mcg  Duramorph® (SOC  arm).   No EXPAREL  TAP infiltration following  
skin-incision  closure.  
Subjects  randomized to Group  1 will receive  an intrathecal  injection of  150 mcg  
preservative -free morphine  for spinal  injection  (e.g., Duramorph) in conjunction  with 
Pacira  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.

single -shot spinal  anesthesia using  1.4 to 1.6 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.75%  and 15 mcg  
fentanyl.  Postoperative pain management  will follow the  multimodal pain regimen  as 
defined  in this protocol.  
• Group  2: 50 mcg  Duramorph +  EXPAREL  TAP infiltration  following  skin-incision  
closure + postoperative  multimodal pain regimen  as defined  in this protocol.  
Subjects  randomized  to Group  2 will receive  an intrathecal  injection of  50 mcg 
preservative -free morphine  for spinal  injection  (e.g., Duramorph) in conjunction  with 
single -shot spinal  anesthesia using  1.4 to 1.6 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.75%.  If deemed  
necessary  by the investigator, intrathecal  fentanyl  can be given  prior  to incision for  the 
C-section.   If intrathecal  fentanyl  is used,  the dose of 15  mcg fentanyl,  date, and time of  
the usage must be  recorded.  In addition,  Group  2 subjects  will receive  EXPAREL  TAP  
infiltration  following  skin-incision  closure plus postoperative  multimodal  pain regimen.  
• Group  3: EXPAREL  TAP infiltration  following  skin-incision  closure + postoperative  
multimodal pain regimen  as defined  in this protocol.  No Duramorph.  
Subjects  randomized  to Group  3 will  NOT  receive  Duramorph  as a spinal  injection.   This 
group  will receive single -shot spinal  anesthesia  using  1.4 to 1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl 
0.75%.   If deemed  necessary  by the investigator,  intrathecal  fentanyl  can be given prior  to 
incision for the C-section.   If intrathecal  fentanyl  is used, the  dose of 15  mcg fentanyl,  
date,  and time of  the usage must be  recorded.   In addition,  Group  3 subjects will  receive  
EXPAREL  TAP infiltration following skin-incision closure plus postoperative  
multimodal pain regimen.  
In all treatment  groups,  a combined  spinal  epidural (CSE)  anesthesia  technique  may also be used 
provided  the epidural  component is not used.   Subjects  who receive  the epidural  component  of 
the CSE anesthesia  must be  immediately  withdrawn  from  the study.  
Intraoperative medications:  The intraoperative use of ketam ine and midazolam (Versed®) is 
discouraged  but may be permitted  if clinically  indicated based  on the  investigator’s  discretion  
(all medications  must be appropriately  recorded  [i.e., drug,  dose,  and route of administration]).  
Prophylactic use of dexamethasone  for prevention  of nausea  and vomiting  is prohibited.  
For Groups 2 and 3, after delivery  of the baby  and prior  to the  TAP infiltration,  a small amount  
of lidocaine (<2 mL) may be administered  subcutaneously  to form  a skin  wheal  over the area of 
the needle  insertion site.  A  2-point classic  TAP block,  in 2 steps (see Pharmacy  Binder),  must be  
performed  under ultrasound guidance and  must be  performed  no more  than 90 minutes after 
skin-incision  closure of the  C-section.  A confirmatory  ultrasound  image or video  will be  taken  
of each side of the  abdomen after the TAP needle  position has been established and following  
infiltration  of study  drug.  
TAP  infiltration (Groups  2 and 3):  The TAP infiltration  includes  two steps:  (1) TAP needle  
placement  and saline  hydrodissection  and (2) study  drug mixture  infiltration  into the TAP.   Each  
step must be  performed  on one side of  the abdomen and must be repeated  on the contralateral

Postsurgical Analgesia:  Patient -controlled  analgesia  is not permitted.  
The following  multimodal pain regimens  will be  used for all treatment  groups.   The date,  time,  
and dose of all standardized  multimodal pain medications  administered  must be recorded.  
All Subjects  in Groups  1, 2, and 3:  
At the  time of  skin-incision  closure (Not e: it is very important  that these be administered  at the 
time of  skin-incision  closure and  not prior to or  before  the end of surgery):  
• Intravenous  (IV) ketorolac  30 mg  (1 dose)  
• IV acetaminophen  1000  mg (1 dose)  
Beginning  6 hours  after skin-incision closure:  
• IV ketorolac  30 mg  beginning  6 hours  from the administration  of IV ketorolac  at the time 
of skin-incision  closure and then every  6 hours (q6h) for the next 18 hours  (i.e., total of 
120 mg  as four 30 -mg doses over first 24 hours  from  the time of  skin-incision closure)  
• IV acetaminophen  1000  mg beginning  6 hours  from the  administration  of IV 
acetaminophen  at the time of  skin-incision closure  and then every  6 hours  (q6h)  for the 
next 18 hours (i.e., total of  4000 mg  as four 1000 -mg doses  over first 24 hours from  the 
time of  skin-incision  closure)  
• Scheduled  PO Tylenol® (acetaminophen) 975 mg beginning  6 hours  from  the 
administration  of the last dose of IV acetaminophen  and q6h for up to 72 hours or  
hospital discharge (whichever  occurs  first)  
• Scheduled  PO ibuprofen  600 mg  beginning  6 hours from  the administration  of the last 
dose of IV ketorolac  and then q6h for up to 72 hours or  hospital discharge  (whichever  
occurs  first)  
This multimodal pain regimen  is a requirement  for all subjects  in the study  and is not subject  
to investigator  discretion.   The date,  time,  and dose of all standardized  multimodal pain 
medications  administered  must be recorded.   Note:  The  scheduled  PO medication  will be  
administered  on a q6h schedule only  till hospital discharge.  
Rescue Medication : When breakthrough  pain occurs, the  study  staff or the floor  nurses  on duty 
will need to ensure that the  study  subject is strictly  following  the protocol -specific  multimodal  
pain regimen  schedule (q6h as defined  in the  protocol) before considering  the use of the  opioids  
as a rescue,  especially  in cases  where  the visual analog  scale (VAS)  score  is relatively  low. 
Subjects  should receive  opioid rescue pain  medication only upon  request  for breakthrough  pain. 
Postsurgical  rescue medication will comprise  PO immediate -release oxycodone  (initiated  at 
5 mg as needed  [PRN]).  If the 5 mg oxycodone is not sufficient  for pain management,  subject

can receive  a dose of 10  mg PRN.  If a subject is unable  to tolerate  PO medication or  fails the PO  
oxycodone rescue,  IV morphine  (initiated  at 1-2 mg) or hydromorphone  (initiated  at 0.3-0.5 mg)  
may be administered  PRN.  All surgical  and postsurgical  opioid and other analgesics  (pain  
medications)  administered  must be documented  through  Day 14 postsurgery.   Additionally,  an 
unscheduled pain  intensity  score  using  a 10 cm VAS  (see Appendix  1) must be completed  
immediately  prior  to any rescue medication  while  in the  hospital.  
Permitted  medications  for the prevention  and treatment  of possible  AEs of medications  include  
the following  (to be administered  at the discretion of  the study  site principal  investigator):  
• Ondansetron  4 mg IV immediately  after delivery  of the  baby  
• Ondansetron  4 mg IV (should not exceed  a maximum  of 12 mg  in a 24 -hour period) for 
intraoperative  and postoperative nausea  and vomiting  
• Metoclopramide 10 mg PO PRN for  nausea  and vomiting  
• Nalbuphine  IV 2.5 mg PRN  for pruritus  
• Naloxone  IV 50 to 100  mcg PRN for pruritus  
Postsurgical  Assessments  
Subjects  will remain  in the  hospital for up to 72 hours  after surgery.   Postsurgical  assessments  
will include:  
 
• Opioid use  
-total opioid burden  
-time to first opioid use  
• Date and time of first unassisted  
ambulation  
• Pain intensity  scores  using  a 10 cm 
VAS  (see Appendix  1) at rest 
(general  and site of  injection)  
• Discharge  readiness  (see 
Appendix  2) 
• Opioid Related  Symptom  Distress  
scale  (ORSDS;  see Appendix  7) • Date and time to first bowel movement  
• Itching  using  Numeric  Rating  Scale  (NRS) of 0 to  
10 (see Appendix  10) 
• Subject's  satisfaction  with postsurgical  pain 
control  (see Appendix  3) 
• Recovery  from Cesarean  Section  scale  (RCSS;  
see Appendix  4) 
• Calls  to physician  about  pain (see Appendix  8) 
• Total  time in post-anesthesia  care unit (PACU)  
• Persistent  opioid use  at Day 30 (see Appendix  9) 
• Emergency  department  visits  
 
 
While  in the hospital , subjects  will be provided  with an electronic patient -reported  outcome  
(ePRO) device  and will use  the device  to record  all scheduled  and unscheduled VAS  scores.   For 
all scheduled  assessments and unscheduled  assessments in the hospital,  subjects  will assess,  
“How much pain are you experiencing  right now in general ?” and “How much pain are you 
experiencing  at the site of the incision”,  a vertical  mark  will be  placed  on the VAS  line to 
indicate  the level  of pain  experienced  at the time of assessment.   If a subject  is discharged  prior  
to a scheduled  VAS assessment, a member  of the study  site staff will contact  the subject  to 
remind  her to complete  the scheduled  VAS  assessment  at the scheduled  time and to record  the

assessment  in the  device,  which the subjects  will take home with them to continue  to record  
study  assessments  at home.  
At hospital  discharge,  the subject  will be instructed  to record  in the device  their daily  pain 
intensity  score  (VAS)  and all pain medications   taken   following  hospital  discharge   through  
Day 14. 
At home , the subject will assess  pain intensity  at rest each day at noon (± 4  hours).   This 
assessment  should capture her  worst pain at rest in the prior  24 hours  by assessing  “What  was 
your worst  pain since  your last pain assessment?”  (i.e., from  noon on the  previous day to the  
current  assessment).   At the  same  time,  the subject  should record  any pain medication  
(medication  name,  date, time, and dose)  taken  in the  prior  24 hours.  
A phone  call will be  made  to each subject on Day 14 for safety  purposes and to inquire  as to 
whether  the subject made  any unscheduled phone  calls or office  visits related to pain,  
experienced  any hospital  readmission,  or experienced  an emergency  room  visit since hospi tal 
discharge.  AEs and serious adverse  events  (SAEs)  will be  recorded  from  the time the  ICF is 
signed  through  Day 14.  Any concomitant  medications to treat AEs through Day  14 will also be 
recorded.   On Day 30, a  phone  call will be  made  to ask the subjects  about  persistent  opioid use. 
9.1.1.  Duration  of the Study and Subject  Participation  
Participation  will begin  at the  signing  of the ICF.  No more than 30 days should pass between  
signing  of the ICF and performance of the  surgery.   The time from  study  drug administration  
through the end of participation is  30 ± 3 days.   Therefore,  subjects may  participate  in the  study  
for up to 63 days.  
9.1.2.  Study Stopping  Rules  
If Pacira,  the investigator, or officials  from regulatory  authorities  discover  conditions during  the 
study  that indicate  that the study  or study  site should be terminated,  this action may  be taken  
after Pacira  has consulted with appropriate  regulatory  authorities and notified  the investigator(s).  
The Pacira  Medical  Monitor and Pharmacovigilance team  review  all SAEs  reported  from Pacira  
clinical  studies on an ongoing  basis  and in real time (i.e., as the events  are reported).  The 
Medical  Monitor is responsible for temporarily  halting  the study  if the type,  frequency,  or 
seriousness/severity  of such events  suggests  a potential threat  to the safety  of the study  
participants.   If such action is taken,  a thorough  review  of all available data  will be  performed.  
Based  on the  results  of this review and  discussions  with investiga tors and/or  regulatory  
authorities  as warranted,  the study  may be restarted  or permanently  terminated.  
In addition,  any death will be  thoroughly  reviewed and appropriate  action  taken.

9.2. Discussion  of Study  Design  
EXPAREL  is indicated  for single -dose infiltration  in adults to produce postsurgical  local  
analgesia  and as an interscalene  brachial plexus nerve  block to produce  postsurgical  regional  
analgesia.  
This Phase  4, multicenter,  randomized  active -controlled  study  will evalu ate the efficacy  and 
safety  of EXPAREL+bupivacaine  infiltration  into the TAP compared  to the  active SOC in  
subjects  undergoing  elective C -section.  
The physiology  of pain involves multiple complex  pathways  and mechanisms and the successful  
management  of pain requires  the use  of a combination of  pain medications  in a “balanced” or 
multimodal approach  to achieve  a state of balanced analgesia  (White  2010) . 
The practice of multimodal  analgesia  is being  adopted across  different  patient -care pathways  and 
is becoming  the SOC at major  surgery  centers  globally.   There  is quite  a variety  of options of  
medications  within the  multimodal approach  either in different  combinations or when  used  
alone.   In all cases , the goal is to reduce postoperative  pain associated  with surgery  and reduce  
opioid use  and opioid -related  AEs.   In some  cases,  such an approach  may also reduce the average  
length  of hospital  stay (Elvir -Lazo  2010) . 
In addition,  the dose-response  relationship  of intrathecal  morphine  for multimodal  post-cesarean  
analgesia  suggests  that 50 mcg produces  analgesia similar  to that produced  by either 100  mcg or 
150 mcg  (Berger  2016) , which  provides  the scientific  support for the current study  design.  
EXPAREL  (liposomal  bupivacaine  injectable  suspension) is an amide local anesthetic  indicated  
for single -dose infiltration into the surgical  site to produce postsurgical  analgesia.  This study  is 
designed  to assess  the effectiveness  of EXPAREL  administered  as a TAP  block in a multimodal  
setting  to reduce total  postsurgical  opioid consumption.  All subjects  in the  study will be eligible  
to receive  an opioid analgesic,  if needed,  to control breakthrough  postsurgical  pain as part of  the 
multimodal approach  to pain management.

related  to the  surgery  and which  may confound  the postsurgical  assessments  
10. Clinically  significant  medical  disease in either the mother  or baby  that, in the opinion of  
the investigator,  would make  participation  in a clinical  study  inappropriate.   This includes  
any psychiatric  or other disease in the  mother  that would constitute  a contraindication  to 
participation  in the study  or cause the mother  to be unable  to comply  with the  study  
requirements.

subject’s  participation  in this study  
13. Previous  participation  in an EXPAREL  study  
In addition,  the subject  will be ineligible to receive  study  drug and will be  withdrawn  from  the 
study  if she  meets the  following  criteria  during  surgery:  
14. Any clinically  significant  event  or condition  uncovered  during  the surgery  
(e.g.,  excessive bleeding,  acute  sepsis)  that might  render  the subject  medically  unstable  or

15. Receives  the epidural  component of  CSE anesthesia  during  participation in the study  
10.3. Removal  of Subjects from  Therapy  or Assessment  
Every  reasonable  effort  shall be made  to maintain  subject  compliance  and participation in the  
study.   Reasons for discontinuation of  any subject  from  the study  will be  recorded.  
If any clinically  significant  event  or condition  is uncovered  during  the surgery  (e.g.,  excessive  
bleeding,  acute  sepsis),  the subject  should be withdrawn  from  the study  and the event  or 
condition  should be reported  as an AE or SAE.  
Additionally,  any subjects who receive  the epidural component  of the CSE anesthesia  must be  
immediately  withdrawn from the study.  
If a subject  withdraws from the  study  and has an ongoing  AE, every effort  must be  made  to 
follow  up on such events  until satisfactory  resolution  is obtained  or further  follow -up is  
otherwise no longer  warranted.

10.3.1.  Withdrawal  Secondary  to Adverse Events  
If a subject  experiences  an AE  that renders  her incapable  of continuing  with the  remaining  
assessments  she will be discontinued from  further  participation  in the study.   A final evaluation  
should be  performed  so that the subject’s  study  participation can be terminated in a  safe and 
orderly  manner.  If such a subject  discontinues  prior to hospital  discharge,  all assessments  to be  
conducted  at 72 hours/hospital discharge  should be conducted  as part of this final examination.  
If such a subject discontinues  following  hospital discharge,  all information  captured  in the  device  
should be  collected  and a final telephone  call for  safety  should be  made.  
Any subject who discontinues  because of an AE  should be instructed  to notify  the study  
personnel  of any abnormalities  and to come  to the  study  site if medical  evaluation is needed  and 
the urgency  of the situation  permits.   Any subject exhibiting  undesirable  AEs will receive  
appropriate  treatment  at the  discretion  of the investigator  until resolution  of the AE. 
This study  involves  a single  infiltration  of study  drug;  therefore,  subjects  should not be  
terminated  from  the ongoing  study  assessments  as long as they are willing  and able to continue  
with the  follow -up schedule according  to the  protocol.  For emergencies  and other  unscheduled  
visits  to a medical  facility  other  than the study  site, medical  records  must  be obtained  by the 
investigator  and appropriate  information  captured  in the  subject’s  case report form  (CRF).  
10.3.2.  Voluntary  or Study  Investigator Withdrawal  
Subjects  are free to discontinue  from  the study  at any time, without  prejudice  to future  treatment.  
A subject  may be discontinued from  the study  if she refuses  EXPAREL  infiltration  or refuses  to 
comply  with study  procedures.  Subjects  should be encouraged  to complete  the study  safety  
assessments.   Reasons  for discontinuation  from  the study  will be  recorded.  
If a subject  is discontinued by the investigator  or voluntarily  withdraws from the  study  after 
receiving  the study  drug,  the subject  will be asked  to complete  a final evaluation so that she can 
be withdrawn  in a safe and orderly  manner.  If such a  subject  discontinues  prior  to hospital  
discharge,  all assessments to be  conducted  at 72 hours/hospital discharge  should be conducted  as 
part of this final examination.   If such a  subject  discontinues following  hospital discharge,  all 
information  captured in the device  should be  collected  and a final telephone  call for safety  
should be  made.  
After  termination  from the study,  the subject may be followed  for safety  including  monitoring  of 
AEs through  Day 14.

11. Treatments  
11.1. Treatment  to be Administered  
There  will be  three  treatment groups  in this study.   On Day  1, prior  to the  C-section,  eligible  
subjects  will be randomized  in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the  three  treatment  groups  listed below:  
• Group  1: 150 mcg  Duramorph® (SOC  arm).   No EXPAREL  TAP infiltration following  
skin-incision  closure.  
Subjects  randomized  to Group  1 will receive  an intrathecal  injection of  150 mcg  
preservative -free morphine  for spinal  injection  (e.g.,  Duramorph) in conjunction  with 
single -shot spinal  anesthesia using  1.4 to 1.6 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.75%  and 15 mcg  
fentanyl.   Postoperative pain management  will follow the  multimodal pain regime n as 
defined  in this protocol.  
• Group  2: 50 mcg  Duramorph +  EXPAREL  TAP infiltration  following  skin-incision  
closure + postoperative  multimodal pain regimen  as defined  in this protocol.  
Subjects  randomized  to Group  2 will receive  an intrathecal  injection of  50 mcg 
preservative -free morphine  for spinal  injection  (e.g.,  Duramorph) in conjunction  with 
single -shot spinal  anesthesia using  1.4 to 1.6 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.75%.  If deemed  
necessary  by the investigator, intrathecal  fentanyl  can be given  prior  to incision for  the 
C-section.  If intrathecal  fentanyl  is used,  the dose of 15  mcg fentanyl,  date and time of  
the usage must  be recorded.  In addition,  Group  2 subjects  will receive  EXPAREL  TAP 
infiltration  following  skin-incision closure plus postoperative  multimodal  pain regimen.  
• Group  3: EXPAREL  TAP infiltration  following  skin-incision closure + postoperative  
multimodal pain regimen  as defined  in this protocol.  No Duramorph.  
Subjects  randomized  to Group  3 will  NOT  receive  Duramorph  as a spinal  injection.   This 
group  will receive single -shot spinal  anesthesia  using  1.4 to 1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl 
0.75%.   If deemed  necessary  by the investigator,  intrathecal  fentanyl  can be given prior  to 
incision for the C-section.   If intrathecal  fentanyl  is used, the  dose of 15  mcg fentanyl,  
date and time of  the usage  must be  recorded.   In addition, Group  3 subjects  will receive  
EXPAREL  TAP infiltration following  skin-incision closure plus postoperative  
multimodal pain regimen.  
In all treatment  groups,  a CSE anesthesia  technique  may also be used provided the epidural  
component  is not used.   Subjects  who receive  the epidural  component  of the  CSE anesthesia  
must be  immediately  withdrawn from the study.  
Intraoperative medications:  The intraoperative use of ketamine  and midazolam (Versed®) is 
discouraged,  but may be permitted  if clinically  indicated based  on the  investiga tor’s discretion  
(all medications  must be appropriately  recorded  [i.e., drug,  dose,  and route of administration]).  
Prophylactic use of dexamethasone  for prevention  of nausea  and vomiting  is prohibited.

For Groups 2 and 3, after delivery  of the baby  and prior to the  TAP infiltration,  a small amount  
of lidocaine  (<2 mL) may be administered  subcutaneously  to form  a skin  wheal  over the area of 
the needle  insertion site.  A  2-point classic  TAP block,  in 2 steps (see Pharmacy  Binder),  must be  
performed  under  ultrasound guidance and  must be  performed  no more  than 90 minutes after 
skin-incision  closure of the  C-section.  A confirmatory  ultrasound  image or video  will be  taken  
of each side of the  abdomen after the TAP needle  position has been established and following  
infiltration  of study  drug.  
TAP  infiltration (Group s 2 and 3):  The TAP infiltration  includes  two steps:  (1) TAP needle  
placement  and saline  hydrodissection  and (2) study  drug mixture  infiltration  into the TAP.  Each  
step must be  performed  on one side of the  abdomen and must be repeated  on the contralateral  
side to complete  the bilateral,  2-point TAP required for  the study.   For complete, step-by-step 
instructions  on performing  the TAP infiltration  under ultrasound  guidance,  please refer to the  
Pharmacy  Binder.  
11.1.1.  EXPAREL  Administration Considerations  
Because of the  potential risk of severe  adverse  effects  associated  with the  administration  of 
bupivacaine,  the study  sites must be equipped  to manage subjects with any evidence of cardiac,  
neurological,  or respiratory  toxicit y. 
Administration  of additional  local  anesthetics,  including  lidocaine,  is prohibited  and no agents  
other  than bupivacaine  HCl (as specified  in the  Pharmacy  Binder)  are to be  admixed with  
EXPAREL.   Lidocaine  and other  local  anesthetics  are not permitted to be locally  administered  
during  the surgery  because  they are known to interact  with EXPAREL  resulting  in the  
displacement  of bupivacaine and elevated  plasma  levels.  
EXPAREL  may not be  administered  to a subject  if the vial has been open  for more than 4 hours.  
In order to prevent  EXPAREL  from settling,  gently  inverting  and re-inverting  the syringe prior  
to administration  is recommended.  
The maximum dosage of EXPAREL  should not exceed  266 mg. 
11.1.2.  Intrathecal  Morphine Administration  Considerations  
The most serious  adverse  effects  encountered  during  administration  of intrathecal  
morphine/hydromorphone  are respiratory  depression  and/or  respiratory  arrest,  which  may be 
severe  and could  require intervention.   Naloxone  injection  and resusc itative  equipment  should be  
immediately  available  for administration  in case of life-threatening  or intolerable  side effects  and 
whenever intrathecal  morphine  therapy  is being  initiated.  
Intrathecal  morphine  is contraindicated  in patients  with medical  conditions that would preclude  
the administration  of opioids via  the IV route,  including  an allergy  to morphine/hydromorphone  
or other  opiates,  acute  bronchial  asthma,  or upper  airway  obstruction.  
Morphine/hydromorphone,  like all opioid analgesics,  may cause  severe  hypotension in

individuals whose  ability  to maintain  blood pressure  is compromised  by a depleted blood volume  
or a concurrent  administration  of drugs,  such as phenothiazines or  general  anesthetics.  
11.2. Identity  of the Investigational  Products  
11.2.1.  Description  of EXPAREL  
EXPAREL  (bupivacaine  liposome  injectable suspension)  is formulated  as a sterile,  
non-pyrogenic,  white to off-white,  preservative -free homogenous  suspension  of bupivacaine  
encapsulated  into multivesicular  liposomes  (DepoFoam  drug delivery  system).  Bupivacaine  is 
present  at a nominal  concentration  of 13.3 mg/mL.   For the purpose  of this study,  EXPAREL  
will be  provided in 20-mL, 1.3%  (13.3  mg/mL)  single -use, clear  glass  vials.  EXPAREL  vials  
should be  stored  refrigerated  at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  
11.2.2.  Description  of Reference Product  
Duramorph® (150 mcg):  Institutional  site SOC.  
11.3. Method  of Assigning  Subjects  to Treatment  
11.3.1.  Randomization  Scheme  
This is an open -label  study.   Subjects  will be randomized in a  1:1:1 ratio into one of  three  
treatment  groups.   The randomization code will be  generated  by a centralized randomization  
system,  which  will also be used to communicate  subject  randomizations  to study  sites.  
All randomized  subjects  will have  both a unique  subject identifier  and a unique random  code  
identifier.  No subject  or random  code  identifiers  will be reused  once  assigned.  
11.3.2.  Randomization  Procedures  
Once a subject is identified  as being  qualified  for the study  in accordance  with the eligibility  
criteria  (see Section 10.1  and Section  10.2), and is at the study  site for surgery,  the research  
pharmacist  or designee will obtain  a randomization  assignment.   The subject will be considered  
randomized  into the study  once  the study  treatment assignment  is received.  
11.3.3.  Replacement  of Subjects  
Subjects  who withdraw  from the study  before  being  randomized  may be replaced.   Once  
assigned,  subject numbers wil l not be reused;  subjects  enrolled  to replace  those who withdraw  
will be  assigned  a unique  subject  number.  
11.4. Selection  of Doses in the Study  
During  the clinical  development  of EXPAREL,  single doses  ranging  from 2 mg  to 665 mg  have  
been safely  administered  via various  routes.  Pharmacokinetic  studies  have shown that because  
EXPAREL  releases  bupivacaine  gradually  as the lipid structure  breaks  down, administration  of 
EXPAREL  266 mg results in a  maximum  plasma  concentration  equivalent  to that seen with 
standard  bupivacaine  100 mg. Clinical  studies have  shown that, for  wound infiltration, a  total

EXPAREL® 402-C-414 CHOICE  (C-Section)  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Amendment  2 
CONFIDENTIAL  38 of 73 07-Feb-2019   
  
dose of 266 mg (20 mL) of EXPAREL  is safe  and efficacious.  Based  on this experience,  the 
FDA -approved  marketed  dose of 266 mg was deemed appropriate for this study.  
Intrathecal  preservative -free morphine  for spinal  injection (e.g.,  Duramorph) is commonly  used 
during  C-section,  usually  at a dose  between  0.1 mg and 0.2 mg.  The midpoint of 0.15 mg 
(150 mcg)  is preferred  by some  anesthesiologists  because it balances  duration of  analgesia  
(which  may be shorter with a lower  dose) and incidence  of opioid -related  AEs,  such as nausea  
and vomiting  (which  may increase  with a higher  dose).   The study  dose of 0.15 mg (150 mcg) of  
intrathe cal morphine  is also supported  by a recent  dose-finding  study  that sought  to determine  
the effective analgesic  dose for 90% of patients  for both intrathecal  morphine  and 
hydromorphone in patient undergoing  C-section (Sviggum  2016) . 
11.5. Prior  and Concomitant  Therapy  and Medications  
11.5.1.  Prior Therapy  and Medications  
Use of any  of the following  medications within the  times specified  before surgery  is prohibited:  
long-acting  opioid medication, NSAIDs,  aspirin  (except for  low-dose aspirin used for 
cardioprotection) within 3 days,  or Tylenol® (acetaminophen)  or any  opioid medication  within  
24 hours.  
11.5.2.  Restricted  Therapy  and Medications  During Surgery  
As described  in the  EXPAREL  Full Prescribing Information  (2018) , no agents are to be  admixed  
with EXPAREL  (e.g., epinephrine,  dexamethasone,  clonidine) other  than bupivacaine.  
Lidocaine  and other local  anesthetics  are not permitted to be locally  administered  during  the 
surgery  because they are known to interact  with EXPAREL, resulting  in the  displacement  of 
bupivacaine  and elevated  plasma  levels.  When a  topical antiseptic is applied to the  surgical  site, 
the solutions should not  be allowed  to come  in contact  with each other (e.g., the area must be  dry 
before EXPAREL  is administered).  Upon  discovering  use of any prohibited therapy  and/or  
medication  during  or after surgery,  the investigator  should document  all events that led to the  
deviation,  write a note to  file, and notify  the Pacira  Medical  Monitor accordingly.  
11.5.3.  Permitted  Therapy  or Medications  after Surgery  
Patient -controlled  analgesia  is not permitted.  
The following  multimodal pain regimens  will be  used for all treatment  groups.   The date,  time,  
and dose of all standardized  multimodal pain medications  administered  must be recorded.  
All Patients  in Groups 1, 2, and 3:  
At the time  of skin-incision  closure (Note:  it is very important  that these be administered  at the 
time of  skin-incision  closure and  not prior to or  before  the end of surgery):  
• Intravenous  (IV) ketorolac  30 mg  (1 dose)  
• IV acetaminophen  1000  mg (1 dose)  
Pacira  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-414 CHOICE  (C-Section)  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Amendment  2 
CONFIDENTIAL  39 of 73 07-Feb-2019   
  
Beginning  6 hours  after skin-incision closure:  
• IV ketorolac  30 mg  beginning  6 hours  from the administration  of IV ketorolac  at the time 
of skin-incision  closure and then every  6 hours (q6h) for the next 18 hours  (i.e., total of 
120 mg  as four 30 -mg doses over first  24 hours  from the  time of  skin-incision closure)  
• IV acetaminophen  1000  mg beginning  6 hours  from the  administration  of IV 
acetaminophen  at the time of  skin-incision closure  and then every  6 hours  (q6h)  for the 
next 18 hours (i.e., total of  4000 mg as four  1000 -mg doses  over first 24 hours from  the 
time of  skin-incision  closure)  
• Scheduled  PO Tylenol® (acetaminophen) 975 mg beginning  6 hours  from  the 
administration  of the last dose of IV acetaminophen  and q6h for up to 72 hours or  
hospital discharge  (whichever occurs  first)  
• Scheduled  PO ibuprofen  600 mg  beginning  6 hours from  the administration  of the last 
dose of IV ketorolac  and then q6h for up to 72 hours or  hospital discharge  (whichever  
occurs  first)  
This multimodal pain regimen  is a requirement  for all subjects  in the study  and is not subject  
to investigator  discretion.   The date,  time,  and dose of all standardized  multimodal pain 
medications  administered  must be recorded.   Note: The  scheduled  PO medication  will be  
administered  on a q6h schedule only  till hospit al discharge.  
Rescue Medication : When breakthrough  pain occurs, the  study  staff or the floor  nurses  on duty 
will need to ensure that the  study  subject is strictly  following  the protocol -specific  multimodal  
pain regimen  schedule (q6h as defined  in the  protocol) before considering  the use of the  opioids  
as a rescue.   Subjects  should receive  opioid rescue  pain medication  only upon request  for 
breakthrough  pain. 
Postsurgical  rescue medication will comprise  PO immediate -release oxycodone  (initiated  at 5 mg  
PRN).  If a subject  is unable to tolerate  PO medication or  fails the PO oxycodone rescue,  IV 
morphine  (initiated  at 1 to 2 mg) or hydromorphone  (initiated  at 0.3 to 0.5 mg) may be 
administered  PRN.  If the 5 mg  oxycodone  is not sufficie nt for pain management,  subject  can 
receive a dose of 10 mg PRN.  If a subject  is unable to tolerate  PO medication or  fails the PO  
oxycodone rescue,  IV morphine  (initiated  at 1to 2 mg) or hydromorphone  (initiated at 0.3 to 0.5  
mg) may be administered  PRN.  All surgical  and postsurgical  opioid and other  analgesics  
(pain  medications)  administered  must be documented  through  Day 14 postsurgery.   Additionally,  
an unscheduled  pain intensity  score  using  a 10 cm VAS  (see Appendix  1) must be completed  
immediately  prior  to any rescue medication  while  in the  hospital.  
Permitted  medications  for the prevention  and treatment  of possible AEs of medications  include  
the following  (to be  administered  at the discretion of  the study  site principal  investigator):  
• Ondansetron  4 mg IV immediately  after delivery  of the  baby

Clinical  Study  Protocol  Amendment  2 
CONFIDENTIAL  40 of 73 07-Feb-2019   
  
• Ondansetron  4 mg IV (should not exceed  a maximum  of 12 mg  in a 24 -hour period) for 
intraoperative  and postoperative nausea  and vomiting  
• Metoclopramide 10 mg PO PRN for nausea  and vomiting  
• Nalbuphine  IV 2.5 mg PRN  for pruritus  
• Naloxone  IV 50 to 100  mcg PRN for pruritus  
11.6. Treatment  Compliance  
Study  drug will be  administered  by the study  staff;  therefore,  treatment  compliance  is ensured.  
11.7. Accountability  of Study  Drug  
Shipment  of EXPAREL  for the study  will contain  an investigational  drug transmittal  and receipt  
form  to assist  the investigator  or designee (e.g.,  pharmacist)  in maintaining  current  and accurate  
inventory  records.   At a minimum, the  investigator  or designee  will maintain accurate  records  
demonstrating  dates and units of drug received, lot numbers,  subjects  to whom drug was 
administered,  and accounts of any  drug destroyed  accidentally  or deliberately.  The investigator  
must retain  vials containing  used,  unused, or  expired  EXPAREL  for return  or destruction,  as 
instructed  by Pacira,  following  confirmation of drug  accountability  data by a study  monitor.  
A record  of drug return  or destruction  will be  maintained and provided  to Pacira.   Inventory  
records  must be  readily  available  for inspection by the study  monitor and/or  appropriate  
regulatory  authorities  at any time.  A copy  of the  inventory  records,  drug accountability  
information,  and notice  of return  or destruction will be  returned  to Pacira  at the end of the study.  
Only  authorized personnel  identified  by the investigator  will have  the ability  to access  and 
administer  the drug.

12. Study Endpoints  and Measurements  
12.1. Efficacy  Measurements  
The following efficacy  measurements  will be  performed  at the times specified  after closure of 
the C-section  skin incision:  
• Date,  time of administration,  and amount  of all postsurgical  opioid rescue  medication  taken  
throug h Day 14 
• Pain intensity  scores  at rest (general  and site of  incision) using  a 10 cm VAS  at 12, 24, 48,  
and 72 hours  after surgery (see Appendix  1) and then once daily  (at noon ±  4 hours)  
through  Day 14 
Note  1: For pain intensity  scores  at 12, 24, 48, or  72 hours, if  the subject  is sleeping,  do not  
wake her to assess  pain.  If she awakens  within the  assessment  window (i.e.,  1 hour  for the 
12- and 24-hour assessments,  2 hours  for the 48 -hour assessments,  and 4 hours for the 
72-hour assessments),  a pain score may be collected  then.  
Note 2: An unscheduled  VAS  score  is also required immediately  prior  to administration  of 
any rescue medication while in the hospital.  
Note  3: If a subject is discharged  prior  to any of the  scheduled  VAS assessments  to be  
collected at  12 to 72 hours  after surgery,  a member of the  study  site staff will telephone  the 
subject  at the appropriate  scheduled  times  (i.e., the time of  each assessment  scheduled  to be  
collected  that occurs after hospital discharge)  to remind her to complete  the VAS  and to 
record  the scheduled  assessments  in the  ePRO  device.   This will ensure that, for  any 
subjects  discharged  prior  to 72 hours, all VAS  assessments  required  for calculation  of the 
study  endpoints  are captured.   These phone  calls will only  occur if  a subject  is discharged  
prior  to 72 hours.  
• Total  time in PACU

13. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A time  and events  schedule for all study  procedures is provided  in Table 1 and Table  2. 
13.1. Instructions  for Conducting  Procedures  and Measures  
All assessments  conducted  after baseline will be  timed from  the completion  of the last C-section  
skin-incision  stitch  (i.e., time of  skin-incision  closure of the  C-section wound following  delivery  
and prior  to the  TAP infiltration).   Day 1 is defined as the day on which study  drug is 
administered.   The beginning  of surgery  is defined as the time  of the  first incision.  The end of 
surgery  is defined  as the time of  closure of the  C-section skin incision.  Postsurgical  is defined  as 
after the end of surgery.  
Subjects  will be hospitalized  for up to 72 hours  after surgery.  Postsurgical  analgesia  and 
collection  of study  data through  hospital discharge  will take  place under the  supervision  of study  
staff.  Following  hospital  discharge,  the subject will record  use of pain medication,  if any, in the  
ePRO  device.   Additionally,  the subject  will record a  daily (at noon ± 4 hours)  10 cm VAS  pain 
score  at rest in the  device  daily  from hospital discharge through  Day 14.  This assessment  should  
capture  her worst  pain at  rest in the prior  24 hours  by assessing,  “What  was your worst  pain since  
your last pain assessment?”  (i.e., from  noon on the  previous  day to the  current assessment).   At 
the same  time,  the subject should record  any pain medication  (medication  name, dose,  date,  and 
time)  taken  in the  prior  24 hours.  
Because the Day 14 assessment is a  phone  call, subjects will be provided  with an addressed  and 
stamped packaging  material  in which  the device  will be returned  by the subject  to the  
investigator.  
13.1.1.  Electronic  Patient  Reported  Outcome  Device  
An ePRO device  will be  given  to the subject at the first scheduled  assessment; the option for  the 
subject  to record  this event via  a mobile app will also be provided.  While  in the  hospital, the  
subject  will use the  device  to record  all scheduled  VAS  (general  and incision site)  (i.e., at 12, 24,  
48, and 72 hours) and  ORSDS  (i.e., at 24, 48, and 72 hours) assessments.   She will also use the 
device  while in the hospital to recor d any unscheduled VAS  assessments  prior to  receiving  
rescue medication.  
If a subject  is discharged  prior  to any of the  scheduled VAS  assessments  to be collected  at 12 to  
72 hours  after surgery  or a scheduled  ORSDS assessment  to be collected at  24 to 72 hours after 
surgery,  a member of  the study  site staff will contact  the subject  at the  appropriate  scheduled  
times (i.e., the time  of each assessment  scheduled  to be collected  that occurs after hospital  
discharge)  to remind  her to complete  the VAS  and ORSDS assessments  and to record  the 
scheduled  assessments  in the device,  which will be  provided  to the subject  at the time of  hospital  
discharge.  This will ensure  that, for any subject  discharged  prior to 72 hours,  all VAS  and 
ORSDS  assessments  required  for calculation  of the study  endpoints are captured.  These phone  
calls will only  be made  if a subject  is discharged  prior  to 72 hours.

Clinical  Study  Protocol  Amendment  2 
CONFIDENTIAL  45 of 73 07-Feb-2019   
  
At hospital discharge,  study  personnel will use  the device  to record  any pain medication  
provided  to the  subject  for home  use and any prescription provided  for any pain medication  to be  
filled following  discharge.  This information  should include  medication  name, dose,  and 
instructions  for use. 
At hospital discharge,  the subject  will be instructed  to record  a daily  VAS  pain intensity  score  
and all pain medications  taken  following  hospital  discharge through  Day 14 in the  device.  
At home, the  subject  will assess  pain intensity  at rest each day at noon (± 4  hours).   This 
assessment  should capture her  worst pain at rest in the prior  24 hours  by assessing,  “What  was 
your worst  pain since  your last pain assessment?”  (i.e., from  noon on the  previous day to the  
current  assessment).   At the  same  time,  the subject  should record  any pain medication  
(date, time, and dose) taken  in the  prior  24 hours.  
13.1.2.  Pain  Intensity  Assessments  
Pain intensity  scores  at rest using  a 10 cm VAS at  12, 24, 48, and 72 hours  (see Appendix  1) and 
once daily  (at noon ±  4 hours)  through  Day 14. 
For pain intensity  scores  at 12, 24, 48, or 72  hours, if the  subject  is sleeping, do not wake her to  
assess  pain.   If she awakens within the  assessment  window (i.e., 1 hour  for the  12- and 24-hour 
assessments,  2 hours  for the 48-hour assessments,  and 4 hours  for the 72 -hour assessments),  a 
pain score may be collected  then.   See Section 13.1.1  regarding  subjects discharged  prior  to 
72 hours.  
To assess  pain intensity  (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly  in a supine or seated  
position that does not exacerbate her  postsurgical  pain for 3 to 5 minutes before  entering  the pain  
score.  
13.1.3.  Itching  Assessments  
Subjects  will be  asked  to rate the intensity  of any itching  they may have  on a Numeric  Rating  
Scale  (NRS) from  0 to 10; 0 being  no itching  and 10 being  worst  itch (see Appendix  10).  Itching  
assessments  will be performed  at screening,  in the  PACU  prior  to PACU discharge,  and at 
12 hours (±1 hour),  24 hours (±1 hour),  48 hours  (±2 hours),  and 72 hours  (±4 hours).  
13.1.4.  Subject  Satisfaction with  Postsurgical  Pain  Control  
Subject  satisfaction  with postsurgical  pain control  will be  assessed  using  a 5-point  Likert  scale  at 
72 hours  or at hospital  discharge,  whichever  occurs first  (see Appendix  3). 
13.1.5.  Recovery  from  Cesarean  Section  Scale  
Recovery  from the  C-section  procedure  will be  assessed using  the RCSS  at 24, 48, and 72 hours  
or hospital  discharge,  whichever  occurs  first (see Appendix  4)

CONFIDENTIAL  46 of 73 07-Feb-2019   
  
13.1.6.  Discharge Readiness  
The subject’s  discharge readiness  will be  assessed  using  the Modified  Post Anesthesia  Discharge  
Scoring  System criteria  (Chung  1995a;  Chung  1995b ; see Appendix  2). The discharge readiness  
assessment  will be  used for data collection  only and is not intended  to interfere  with the  
investigational  site’s  policy  for determining  when  the subject  should be discharged  from  the 
hospital.  Discharge readiness will be assessed  at 24, 48, and 72 hours  or at hospital discharge  or 
until the  subject  attains a  score  of 9, whichever  occurs  first. 
13.1.7.  Opioid Related  Symptom  Distress  scale  (ORSDS)  
The subject’s  opioid related  symptom  distress  will be  assessed  using  the ORSDS  scale at  24, 48,  
and 72 hours  (see Appendix  7). See Section  13.1.1  regarding  subjects disch arged  prior  to 
72 hours.  
13.1.8.  Surgical  Fear Questionnaire  (SFQ)  
The subject’s  attitudes  toward pain prior to surgery  will be  recorded  during screening  or baseline  
(see Appendix  6). 
13.1.9.  Calls to  Physician  
Participants  will record  the number  of calls made to their physician  after discharge,  for pain 
related  to their surgery,  to be collected  on Day 14 (see Appendix  8). 
13.1.10.  Persistent  Opioid Use  
Participants  will be asked  if they  are still taking  opioids on Day  30 (see  Appendix  9). 
13.2. Obtaining  Informed  Consent  
Potential participants  may provide informed  consent  up to 30 days before  their scheduled  
surgery.   If a subject  can only be screened  on the day  of surgery,  the consent process  must be  
started  at least 24 hours prior  to the  day of surgery  in order  to ensure  ample  time for the subject  
to review the ICF and have  all her questions  answered  by the investigator/study  staff prior  to 
providing  informed  conse nt.  Screening  procedures that are SOC at the institution may  be 
completed  prior  to written informed  consent.   Any screening  procedures  that are not SOC must  
be completed  after written informed  consent  is provided and prior  to surgery  (see Section 13.3). 
13.3. Screening/Baseline  Procedures  
Subjects  will be screened  within  30 days prior  to surgery;  screening  on the  day of surgery  will be  
allowed  but is discouraged.   If a subject  can only be screened  on the day of surgery,  the informed  
consent  process  must still be started  at least 24 hours prior  to the  conduct  of any screening  
procedures  that are  not considered  SOC at the institution and such procedures  may not be  
performed  until written  informed consent is provided.   All screening  procedures  that are  not SOC  
must be  performed  and documented within the 30 -day time window  (inclusive of  the day of 
surgery  for those  subjects who can only be screened on the day of surgery)  as described  here.

14. ADVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING  
Consistent with the current  regulatory  guidance provided by  the US CFR and the  ICH GCP,  
AEs and SAEs  are defined  in Section 14.1.1  and Section  14.2.1 , respectively.  
The concepts  of AEs and SAEs represent  regulatory  instruments  used to evaluate  and monitor  
the safety  of clinical  study  subjects.   Therefore,  these  terms  only apply  in light of their  regulatory  
definition.   The term serious, in a  regulatory  sense, does not necessarily  mean severe.   The SAE  
concept  is primarily  used to identify,  during  the conduct of the  study,  those  SAEs  that may  
require  expedited reporting  to regulatory  authorities.  
14.1. Adverse  Events  
14.1.1.  Definitions of Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical  occur rence associated  with the  use of a drug in humans,  whether  or not 
considered  drug related.   An AE (also  referred  to as an adverse experience)  can be any 
unfavorable and  unintended sign (e.g., abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  
temporally  associated  with the use  of a drug, without any  judgment  about  causality.   An AE can 
arise from  any use of the drug  (e.g.,  off-label  use in combination  with another  drug)  and from  
any route  of administration,  formulation,  or dose,  including  an overdose.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change  in a body  structure  or body  function.  
Adverse  events  include  any clinically  significant  deterioration  of a subject’s  medical  status.  
The AE may involve  any organ  or system  and can be represented  by the new onset  or the  
deterioration  of a disease,  a syndrome,  a symptom,  a physical  sign,  as well as by findings  and 
results  of instrumental  examinations and laboratory  tests.  Any medically  relevant  and untoward  
change  after the subject  signs the  ICF, including frequency  or pattern  changes  for a fluctuating  
condition  (e.g.,  migraine), is considered  an AE. 
An AE that occurs after the ICF has been signed  and before the start of the  study  drug 
administration  is identified  as a pretreatment  AE.  An AE that occurs after the administration  of a 
study  treatment  is considered  a TEAE.  
Adverse  Reaction : Any AE caused  by a drug.  Adverse  reactions  are a subset of all suspected  
adverse  reactions  for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused  the event.  
Suspected  Adverse Reaction : Any  AE for which  there  is a reasonable possibility  that the drug  
caused  the AE.  For the  purposes of investigational  new drug safety  reporting,  ‘reasonable  
possibility’  means  there  is evidence to suggest  a causal  relationship  between the drug  and the 
AE. A suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser degree of certainty  about causality  than 
adverse  reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.   Suspected  adverse reactions  are a 
subset of  all AEs for which there is a reasonable  possibility  that the drug  caused  the event.

14.1.2.  Recording  Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility  of the investigator  to document all AEs (i.e., pretreatment  AEs and 
TEAEs)  with an onset  after the subject  signs the  ICF.  For the purpose  of this study,  all AEs that 
occur  through  Day 14 after surgery  must be  recorded  regardless  of whether or not they are 
considered  related  to study  drug.  Whenever  feasible,  AE terms  should be  documented  as 
medical  diagnoses  (highest possible  level  of integration);  otherwise,  the AEs should be  reported  
separately  as individual signs  or symptoms.   Only  one AE per line should be recorded  in the  AE 
CRF.   For example,  an AE of  nausea  and vomiting should be  listed as two separate events:  the 
event  of nausea and  the event of vomiting.   If a diagnosis  is established  after symptoms  are 
recorded  on the AE CRF,  the diagnosis  should be  recorded  and the symptoms collapsed  
(removed; i.e.,  lined  through  and initialed).   Whenever possible,  abnormal  laboratory  results  
should be  reported  as their clinical  corollary  (e.g.,  low potassium should be  recorded  as 
hypokalemia).  
A continuous  AE with varying grades  of severity  must be  recorded  as one AE. The highest  
grade of severity  experienced  by that subject  during  the course  of the continuous AE must be  
recorded.  
Any condition  noted  before  the subject  signs the  ICF will be  listed as medical  history  and is 
considered  a pre-existing  condition.   If a pre-existing  condition  changes  (i.e., becomes  more  
severe  or more frequent)  at any time after the ICF is signed,  or after study  drug administration,  
it is considered  an AE.  Note:  A change  in treatment  for a pre-existing  condition  (e.g.,  new high 
blood pressure  medication) does not necessarily  indicate  an AE. 
Information  recorded  on the AE CRF  will include  the AE term,  the date and time of  onset,  
severity,  seriousness,  relationship to study  drug,  action taken  with study  drug,  action taken  for 
the AE, and the outcome  of the  AE, including  the date and time of  resolution, if  applicable.  
14.1.3.  Severity  of Adverse Events  
The severity  of an AE must be categorized  using  the following guidelines:  
Mild : An AE that is easily  tolerated  by the subject, causing  minimal  discomfort and not  
interfering  with everyday  activities  
Moderate : An AE that is discomforting  and interferes  with normal everyday  activities  
Severe : An AE that prevents  normal  everyday  activities  
The term “severe” is often used to describe  the intensity  (severity) of a  specific  event  (as in mild,  
moderate,  or severe  myocardial  infarction).   The event itself; however,  may be of relatively  
minor medical  significance (such  as severe  headache).  This is not  the same  as "serious,"  which  
is based  on subject/event  outcome  or action  criteria  usually  associated  with events  that pose a  
threat  to a subject's  life or functioning.   Seriousness (not severity)  serves  as a guide for defining  
regulatory  reporting  obligations.

14.1.4.  Relationship  of Adverse Events  to Study Drug  
The investigator  must assess  the relationship  of the  AE to study  drug after careful  medical  
consideration  on a case-by-case basis.  General  guidelines  for determining  the AE’s  causality  to 
the study  drug are provided below.  
Unrelated : A causal  relationship  between  the study  drug and the AE can be easily  ruled out  
(e.g.,  based  on the  temporal sequence,  absence of a reasonable  pathophysiological  
mechanism,  or direct  evidence  of actual  cause)  
Unlikely : A clinical  event  with a  temporal  relationship  to study  drug administration,  which  
makes  a causal  relationship  improbable  and in which other  drugs,  chemicals,  or 
underlying  disease  provide  a plausible  explanati on 
Possible:  A clinical  event  with a  reasonable  time sequence to administration  of the study  drug 
but which  could  also be  explained by a concurrent  disease or other drugs  or 
chemicals  
Probable:  A clinical  event  with a  reasonable  time sequence to administration  of the study  drug 
unlikely  to be attributed  to a concurrent  disease  or other  drugs  or chemicals  and 
which  follows a  clinically  reasonable  response  on withdrawal  (dechallenge)  
Definite:  The pharmacological  properties  of the  study  drug(s)  or of the  substance  class, and  
the course  of the  AE after dechallenge and,  if applicable,  after rechallenge,  and/or  
specific test indicate  involvement of the study  drug(s) in the  occurrence/worsening  
of the  AE and no indication of  other  causes  exists  
14.1.5.  Outcome of Adverse Events  
The investigator will assess  the outcome  of the AE after careful  medical consideration,  on a 
case-by-case basis.   General  guidelines  are provided below:  
Recovered/Resolved:  The event  resolved and the subject  recovere d from the  AE 
 
Recovered/Resolved  
with Sequelae:  
Not Recovered/  
Not Resolved:  The initial  event  resolved,  but has a  continuing  abnormal  condition  
as a result  of the AE 
At the time  of last assessment, the event  was ongoing,  with an  
undetermined  outcome.   Note:  ongoing  AEs are not to be  considered  
resolved  as a result  of death.  
Recovering/Resolving:  At the time  of last assessment, the event  was decreasing  in 
frequency,  severity,  etc., and a resolution  was expected  
Fatal:  The AE directly  caused  death

Clinical  Study  Protocol  Amendment  2 
CONFIDENTIAL  54 of 73 07-Feb-2019   
  
Unknown:  There  was an inability  to access  the subject  or the  subject’s  records  
to determine the outcome  (e.g.,  subject  withdrew consent  or was 
lost to follow -up) 
14.1.6.  Action  Taken  with  Subject  Because  of an Adverse Event  
The investigator will provide any  actions  taken  regarding  the subject  (e.g.,  treatment,  diagnostic  
tests, laboratory  tests, or  therapy)  for each reported AE, as suggested  below:  
• None  
• Medication  
• Non-pharmaceutical  therapy  (The specific  therapy  used must be recorded  in the CRF)  
• Discontinued  from  study  
• Other (The specific  action taken  must be recorded  in the  CRF)  
14.2. Serious  Adverse  Events  
14.2.1.  Definition of a Serious  Adverse Event  
Definition  of an SAE:  An AE is considered  “serious” if, in the  view  of either  the investigator  or 
Sponsor, it results  in any  of the  following  outcomes:  
• Death1 
• A life-threatening  AE2 
• Inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization3 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity4 
• Congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically  significant5 
1Death:  Any event  resulting  in a subject’s  death  must be  reported  as an SAE.   However,  death,  
in and of  itself,  is not an AE; it is an outcome.   The cause of death is the  AE. Therefore,  the 
investigator should make every  effort  to obtain  and document  the cause of death  for all subjects  
who die  during  the study.   If, despite all  efforts,  the cause of death  remains  unknown, the  AE 
should be  documented  as an “unspecified  fatal event.”  
2Life-threatening :  An AE is considered  life-threatening  if, in the  view  of either  the investigator  
or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject at immediate  risk of death.  It does not include  an 
AE that, had it occurred  in a more severe form,  might  have  caused  death.  
3Hospitalization :  It should be noted  that hospitalization, in and of  itself,  does not represent  an 
SAE.   It is the AE leading  to the  subject’s hospitalization  that becomes  “serious”  when  it 
requires  inpatient  care.   Consequently,  an SAE  should not be  reported  in cases of preplanned  
hospitalizations for  a pre-existing  condition  that did not worsen  during  the study.   However,  
any medical  condition that delays  a subject’s discharge from the hospital  (i.e., prolonged  
hospitalization) or requires  the subject  to be  readmitted should be  reported  as an SAE.

4Persistent  or significant incapacity :  A substantial disruption of a  person’s ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
5Medically  Significant : Important  medical  events that may not result in death,  
be life-threatening,  or require  hospitalization, may  be considered  serious  when, based  upon  
appropriate  medical  judgment, they  may jeopardize  the subject  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the  outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such 
medically  significant  events include  allergic  bronchospasm requiring  intensive  treatment  in an 
emergency  room or  at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in inpatient  
hospitalization, or  the development  of drug  dependency  or drug  abuse.  
14.2.2.  Reporting  Serious  Adverse Events  
Any SAE  or death  that occurs at any time after the subject  signs  the ICF through  Day 14, 
whether  or not related  to EXPAREL,  must be reported  by the investigator  or designee to Pacira  
Drug  Safety  either  via email (drugsafety@pacira.com ) or fax to 973 -201-0649 within 24 hours  of 
discovery.   In addition,  the investigator  or designee is encouraged  to contact  the Medical  Monitor  
to discuss  the case,  PRN.  
Investigators  should not wait to receive additional  information  to fully  document the event  
before notifying  Pacira  Drug  Safety  or designee of the SAE.  The  fax or email  report  should be  
followed  by a full written  summary  using  the SAE  Form  detailing  relevant  aspects  of the SAE in  
question.   Where  applicable,  information  from  relevant  hospital  records  and autopsy  reports  
should be  obtained  and all patient -identifying  information redacted  prior  to forwarding  to Pacira.  
In the event  of a fatal or life -threatening  SAE,  any required  follow -up must be provided  to Pacira  
Drug  Safety  or designee immediately.   The investigator  will follow all SAEs  until resolved  or the 
condition  stabilizes  and further  follow -up is not warranted.  
If the investigator  is made  aware  of any SAEs  after Day 14, these  should  also be reported  to 
Pacira  Drug  Safety  or designee provided the SAE  is considered  related  to EXPAREL.   The site 
would then provide  a completed SAE form  within  1 business day  and the event  would be  
followed  until resolution,  or until adequate  stabilization  is met.

15. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
A comprehensive statistical  analysis  plan (SAP)  will be  developed  for this study.  
15.1. Study Objective  
The primary  objective  of this study  is to compare  total opioid consumption through  72 hours  
following  EXPAREL  infiltration  into the TAP with SOC in subjects  undergoing  an elective C- 
section.  
15.2. Study Endpoint s 
The endpoints  to be  assessed  in this study  are listed in  Section 12.2 (Efficacy  Endpoints)  and 
Section  12.4 (Safety  Endpoints).  
15.3. Determination  of Sample  Size 
Assuming  a log-normal  distribution for  total opioid  consumption  with a 70%  coefficient  of 
variation,  5% alpha,  an equal randomization  ratio,  and 80% power, a  total of 77  subjects  per 
treatment  group will be  sufficient  to detect  a 25% reduction  in total opioid consumption.  
Assuming  5% of the  subjects are  not evaluable  and one  of the  two EXPAREL  groups  will be  
dropped  after interim  analysis  when  a total of 60 subjects are treated,  a total sample  size of 
approximately  182 treated subjects  is needed.   This sample size  will be  re-evaluated  after the 
interim  analysis.  
15.4. Analysis  Populations  
The safety  analysis  set will include  all subjects  who receive  study  drug.  All analyses  based on  
the safety  set will be by actual treatment  received.  
The efficacy  analysis  set will include  all randomized  subjects  who undergo  C-section.  All  
analyses  based on the efficacy  analysis  set will be  by randomized treatment  regardless  of the 
actual treatment  received.  
The per-protocol  efficacy  analysis  set will include  all subjects  in the efficacy  analysis  set who do  
not have  any important  protocol deviations.   All analyses  based on the per -protocol analysis  set 
will be  by randomized treatment  regardless  of the actual  treatment  received.  
15.5. Handling  Subject  Dropouts  and Discontinuations  
Methods  for dealing  with missing  data will be described  in the  SAP.  
15.6. Statistical  Analyses  
15.6.1.  Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic  and baseline  characteristics  will be  summarized  descriptively  by treatment  group.

The percentage of subject in each analysis  set and the percentage who fail to complete  the study  
(as well as the reasons  for discontinuation)  will be displayed  by treatment  group.  
15.6.3.  Efficacy  Analyses  
A comprehensive SAP will be  developed  for this study.  Efficacy  endpoint  analyses  will be  
conducted on the  efficacy  analysis  set. The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  will also be analyzed  
using  the per-protocol  analysis  set as a sensitivity  analysis.  
Summary  statistics  (number,  mean,  median, standard deviation,  minimum,  and maximum) will 
be shown for each continuous  measure  of efficacy  by treatment  group.   The number  and 
percentage of subjects in each category  will be  shown for each categorical  measure  of efficacy  
by treatment  group.   For time to event  measures  of efficacy,  medians and Kaplan -Meier  
estimates  will be  shown by  treatment  group.  
Baseline is defined  as the last non -missing  assessment of  a given  endpoint  prior  to the first dose 
of trial drug unless otherwise  specified.  
All assessments  will be  listed in subject  data listings.  
The analyses  of the primary,  secondary,  and exploratory  efficacy  endpoints will be  described  in 
the SAP.  
15.6.4.  Safety Analyses  
Adverse  event  verbatim  terms  will be  mapped  to preferred  terms and related system  organ class  
using  the Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities.  All summaries  of AEs will include  AEs 
that occur  after the beginning  of anesthesia.  All summaries  of AEs will be  based  on the safety  
analysis  set.  Events  that start prior  to anesthesia  will be  identified  in listings  only.  Incidence  
rates of AEs after the start of anesthesia  and the proportion of subjects  prematurely  withdrawn  
from  the study  due to an  AE will be  shown for each treatment  group.   Incidence rates will also be  
shown for each treatment  group  for study  drug-related AEs after the start of  anesthesia  and by 
severity.   Incidence  rates of SAEs will also be  shown for each treatment  group.  All incidence  
rates will be categorized  and shown by system  organ class  and preferred  term.  
Vital signs  and pulse  oximetry  results  will be  summarized  by treatment  group  at each assessment  
timepoint.  Summaries  will present  both actual  and change -from -baseline results.  Vital  signs  and 
pulse oximetry  results will also be assessed  for potentially  clinically  significant  abnormal  values.  
The number  and percentage of subjects  satisfying  the potentially  clinically  significant  abnormal  
criteria  at any time during  the study  and at each assessment  timepoint  will be tabulated  by 
treatment  and overall  treatments.   Details  will be  described  in the  SAP.  
15.7. Significance  Testing  
Significance testing  will be  described  in the  SAP.

15.8. Interim  Analyses  
After  approximately  20 subjects per  treatment  group  are randomized and treated  (i.e., a total of 
60 subjects  are treated  in this study),  an interim  analysis  will be  conducted to evaluate  and 
compare the clinical  efficacy/safety  and health economics  benefits  between  the two EXPAREL  
groups  against  the SOC control group.  The primary  purpose  of this interim  analysis  is to select  
one EXPAREL  treatment  group out of the  two EXPAREL  treatment  groups  to continue for the 
rest of the study.   The second purpose of this interim analysis  is to evaluate  the sample size 
assumptions  and the selection  of the primary/secondary  endpoints.   Full details on the planned  or 
additional  interim  analysis  will be  covered  in a prospective interim  analysis  plan.

CONFIDENTIAL  63 of 73 07-Feb-2019   
  
18.1. Appendix  1: Subject’s  Reported  Pain  (Visual  Analog  Scale)  at Rest  
Subjects  will be evaluated  for pain intensity  scores  (general  and site of  incision)  at rest using  a 
10 cm VAS at  rest at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours  after surgery  and then once  daily  (at noon  
± 4 hours) through  Day 14.  For pain intensity  scores  at 12, 24, 48, or  72 hours, if  the subject  is 
sleeping,  do not wake  her to assess  pain.   If she awakens  within the  assessment window  
(i.e., 1 hour for the 12- and 24-hour assessments,  2 hours  for the 48 -hour assessments, and 
4 hours for the 72-hour assessment s), a pain score  may be collected.  
If a subject  is discharged  prior  to any of the  scheduled VAS  assessments  to be collected  at 12 to  
72 hours  after surgery,  a member  of the study  site staff will contact  the subject at the appropriate  
scheduled times (i.e., the time of  each assessment  scheduled  to be  collected  from  12 to 72 hours  
that occurs  after hospital  discharge)  to remind  her to complete  the VAS  assessment and to record  
the scheduled  assessment  in the device.   This will ensure that, for any  subject discharged  prior  to 
72 hours,  all VAS  assessments required  for calculation  of the  study  endpoints  are captured.  
These phone  calls will only  be made  if a subject is discharged  prior to 72 hours.  
While  in the  hospital, subjects  will als o record  an unscheduled VAS  pain score  immediately  
before  any requested  opioid pain medication.  
To assess  pain intensity  (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly  in a supine  or seated  
position that does not exacerbate her  postsurgical  pain for 3 to 5 minutes before  recording  the 
pain score.  
While  in the hospital , subjects  are to assess,  “How much  pain are you experiencing  right now in 
general ?” and  “How much pain are you experiencing  right now at the site of the  incision?”  They  
are advised to place  a vertical  mark  on the line below to indicate  the level  of pain experienced  at 
the time  of assessment,  with a line closer to the  left meaning  little or  no pain and a  line closer to  
the right meaning  much  pain or pain as bad as it can be.  This should be  completed for both the 
general  pain and pain at the  site of incision  (i.e., two VAS  scales).  
At home , the subject will assess  pain intensity  at rest each day at noon (± 4  hours).   This 
assessment  should capture her  worst pain at rest in the prior  24 hours  by assessing,  “What  was 
your worst  pain since  your last pain assessment?”  (i.e., from  noon on the  previous day to the  
current  assessment) through  Day 14.

18.2. Appendix  2: Discharge  Readiness  
The subject’s  discharge readiness  will be  assessed  using  the Modified  Post Anesthesia  Discharge  
Scoring  System below  (Chung  1995a;  Chung  1995b) . 
The discharge readiness  assessment  will be  used for data collection  only and is not intended  to 
interfere with the  investigational  site’s  policy  for determining  when the subject  should be  
discharged  from the hospital.  
Discharge  readiness  will be assessed  at 24, 48, and 72 hours,  or at hospital discharge,  or until the  
subject  attains score of 9, whichever  comes  first.  Once a score  of 9 is reached,  no further  
discharge readiness  assessments are required.

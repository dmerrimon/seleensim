1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date 
Original 17 March 2014
Amendment 1 12 June 2014
Amendment 2 11 February 2015
Administrative Change 1 24 July 2015
Administrative Change 2 16 October 2015
Amendment 3 17 June 2016
Administrative Change 3 29 September 2016
Administrative Change 4 07 November 2017
The purpose of this amendment is to:
●Add benefits and risks evaluation information and updated study procedures in 
the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (Section 3.5,Section 5.3.1.1, 
Section 5.4.1, Section 5.7, Section 6.1.6, Section 9.2, and Section 9.3).
Rationale:  To confirm that the current pandemic situation does not change 
the benefit risk of study participation as COVID-19 related risks are not 
expected to differ substantially between trial participants and the broader 
population of subjects being treated for metastatic breast cancer, as well as allow for procedure modification in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
(including local labs, study drug shipment from sites to patients, subject 
withdrawal, Adverse Event reporting and consent procedures).
●Introduce the option of off-site phone visits every other cycle for subjects who 
have been receiving single-agent veliparib/placebo at a stable dose without 
adjustment for multiple cycles without uncontrolled adverse events, and to add table of assessments for these visits (Section 5.1 ,Section 5.3.1.1and 
AppendixF).
Rationale: To add flexibility, with appropriate guidance, for subjects on study
long term, while maintaining standard of care safety monitoring and tumor 
assessments.

●Remove references to Blinded/Unblinded TA MD and study teams throughout 
protocol.
Rationale:  Primary site monitors, investigators and subjects continue to be 
blinded to treatment assignment until disease progression, after which 
unblinding to determine eligibility for crossover can be requested. However, 
the sponsor was unblinded to treatment assignment at the time of the primary analysis (03 June 2019). Therefore, a separate unblinded Study management 
team within AbbVie is no longer responsible for study conduct and data 
monitoring for subjects who crossover to open-label veliparib.
●Include language to indicate that AbbVie may remove the requirements for 
sites to send clinical laboratory samples to the central laboratory and radiology 
scans to the central reviewer, or discontinue the requirements for central reviewat any time during the course of the study (Section 5.3.1.1).
Rationale: Local laboratory evaluations and local review of radiology scans 
can support safety monitoring and tumor assessment evaluation.  AbbVie may discontinue the requirements for the central laboratory and central radiology 
review, as the primary analysis has been completely.
●Update tumor assessment schedule from every 9 weeks to allow every 
12weeks (or at longer intervals not to exceed24 weeks per the investigator's 
discretion) from the priorscan (Section 5.3.1.1).
Rationale:  To modify the tumor assessment schedule after completion of the 
primary analysis in order to allow the Investigators to follow standard of care for patients with disease control for several years and limit cumulative 
radiation exposure and associated risks.
●Update IDMC review language according to current expectations 
(Section5.3.5and Section 8.1.8).
Rationale:  As primary analysis has occurred, no additional IDMC reviews 
will occur.
●Update the guidelines on when chemotherapy can begin based on hematologic 
blood counts (Section 5.7.1.1).
Rationale:  The update aligns with other study guidance within the program 
for other veliparib studies, for which the primary analysis has been completed 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
5
and the safety profile of veliparib in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel was acceptable.
●Add language on the reporting of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid 
leukemia, or any secondary primary malignancy (Section 6.1.5).
Rationale: To clarify the time period of reporting of specific adverse events of 
special interest which may have a delayed onset.
●Modify the Table of Study Procedures for Post Treatment Phase and for 
patients that are considered on study, off drug ( AppendixE).
Rationale: To simplify procedures required for subjects who discontinue 
therapy without progressive disease (i.e., subjects who are on study, off drug), requiring only those procedures needed for safety monitoring and tumor 
assessment.  Also, to ensure that survival follow-up is the same for all subjects who have discontinued therapy, and to remove the requirement of tumor 
assessment at Final Visit in subjects without a tumor assessment within 
4 weeks as these were infrequently required and of lower priority after the primary analysis.
●Clarify the timing/conduct of additional OS analyses before the final OS analysis, if needed (Section 8.1.3).
Rationale:  Allow for additional interim analyses of study data if requested by 
regulatory agencies or otherwise warranted.
●Change duration of response (DOR) from secondary to tertiary endpoint (Section 5.3.3and Section 8.1).
Rationale: To align with most recent version of Statistical Analysis Plan 
which was finalized prior to primary analysis.
●Include updates from Administrative Changes 3 and 4 throughout the protocol.
●Update contacts for safety reporting related questions or concerns and protocol deviations (Section 6.1.6and Section 7.0).
●Correct grammatical errors and inconsistencies throughout the protocol.
An itemized list of all changes made to the protocol under this amendment can be found 
in AppendixM.

1.2 Synopsis
AbbVie Protocol Number:   M12-914
Name of Study Drug:   Veliparib (ABT-888) Phase of Development:   Phase 3
Name of Active Ingredient:   Not applicable Date of Protocol Synopsis:   23July 2020
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3 Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or 
Without the PARP Inhibitor Veliparib (ABT-888) in HER2-Negative Metastatic or Locally Advanced Unresectable BRCA -Associated Breast Cancer
Objectives:  The primary endpoint is to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of veliparib in 
combination with carboplatin (C) and paclitaxel (P) compared to placebo with C/P in subjects with a BRCA1and/or BRCA2 Mutation and HER2-Negative Metastatic or Locally Advanced Unresectable 
Breast Cancer.
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), 
objective response rate (ORR), and PFS2 in subjects treated with veliparib in combination with C/P versus subjects treated with placebowith C/P.  The tertiary objectives are to assess duration of overall response (DOR), change in ECOG performance status, and change in Quality of Life (QoL).
Study Sites:  Multicenter; Approximately 200
Study Population:   Men and women ≥ 18 years of age with HER2-negative metastatic or locally 
advanced unresectable breast cancer and clinically significant (suspected deleterious or deleterious) BRCA1and/or BRCA2 germline mutation.  Patients with bone-only disease and/or hormone receptor 
positive (ER and/or PR) disease should be deemed appropriate candidates for combination chemotherapy.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of veliparib 
in combination with C/P compared to placebo plus C/P in subjects with BRCA1or BRCA2germline 
mutation and with HER2-negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer who have received no more than 2 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease.
Veliparib/placebo will be dosed in combination with carboplatin AUC 6 with weekly paclitaxel 
(80mg/m
2), on a 21-day cycle.  Subject randomization will be in a 2:1 ratio to veliparib/C/P or 
placebo/C/P and stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive versus ER/PgR negative, prior platinum therapy (yes versus no), and CNS metastases (yes versus no).
Subjects with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation per local lab testing and who meetthe remaining eligibility 
criteria may be randomized.  Patients who meet NCCN guidelines for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing are eligible 
for testing during the screening period.  BRCAmutation status will be documented for all subjects by the 
central laboratory (Myriad).Subjects who discontinue carboplatin and paclitaxel and who have not progressed will continue 
veliparib/placebo as a single agent at the recommended Phase 2 single agent dose.  Subjects will continue dosing until they meet the defined treatment discontinuation criteria.  Subjects who discontinue carboplatin, paclitaxel, and veliparib/placebo for reasons other than progression should remain on study.  At the time PD is documented according to RECIST 1.1, subjects randomized to placebo may be eligible to crossover to unblinded veliparib monotherapy.

Methodology (Continued):
Tumor assessments (CT scan or MRI of the full chest, abdomen, pelvis and brain MRI or contrast CT) 
were performed at screening and then every 9 weeksfrom C1D-2 until tumor progressionto determine 
the extent of tumor burden per RECIST 1.1.  Following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, the tumor assessmentintervalmay be increased to every 12 weeksfrom last scan until tumor progression. At theinvestigator's discretion, the interval between scans may be longer than every 12 weeks for subjects who have durable disease control but must not exceed 24 weeks.  Post-baseline brain MRI or contrast CT is only required in subjects with CNS lesions at baseline; in all other subjects, CNS imaging will be obtained as clinically indicated based upon symptoms indicative of CNS disease. Referto Section 5.3.1.1 and Appendix C, Appendix D, and Appendix E foradditional tumor assessment schedule details, including details for subjects on open-label crossover veliparib.
In addition to being reviewed by the investigator and/or site staff, radiographic scans will be sent to a 
central imaging center for review.  Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression should remain on study and continue to undergo a modified schedule of assessments until disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  For these subjects who meet study treatment discontinuation criteria and who have not progressed (such as subjects who initiate another anti-cancer therapy), tumor assessment data per RECIST 1.1 will continue to be collected to document tumor status and the date of progression.  Post treatment information (including dates and response to subsequent therapies) and survival information will be collected every two months beginning on the date the subject has discontinued study therapy until the endpoint of death, the subject is lost to follow-up or until the study termination by AbbVie.
QoL assessment via the EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires will be collected on 
C1D-2 pre-dose, Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 4 (C6, C8, etc.), Final Visit, and 30-Day Follow-Up Visit.  Subjects who crossover to the unblinded veliparib monotherapy arm will continue to have QoL assessments performed as per this schedule (Day 1 of the first and second cycle of unblinded monotherapy and every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 4 until 2
nddisease progression or until they meet the defined study treatment discontinuation criteria and at 
the Final Visit and 30-Day Follow-Up Visit).  P ain assessment via the BPI-SF will be collected at every 
cycle.

Interim Analyses: To ensure subject safety, an IDMC reviewed unblinded safety data (which included all subjects enrolled in the study) when approximately 60 subjects met at least one of the following criteria:
!Received 6 cycles of treatment
!Reached an event of disease progression
!Discontinued the study due to toxicity/adverse events
Subsequent IDMC reviews of unblinded safety data prior to the primary analysis were carried out based on IDMC recommendations. No additional reviews by the IDMC will occur since the Sponsor management team was unblinded after completing the primary analysis.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Progression-free Survival (PFS):   will be evaluated according to progression per RECIST (version 1.1) 
and survival information (death).  Radiologic tumor response and disease progression will be assessed by CT scan utilizing RECIST (version 1.1).  Assessments werebe performed at Screening, at 9-week intervals (from C1D-2)thereafter until disease progression. Following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4thetumor assessmentinterval maybe increased toevery 12weeks from last scan until tumor progression; at investigator discretion, the interval between scans may be longer than 12 weeks but must not exceed 24 weeks.
Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Overall Response 
(DOR):  will be evaluated according to progression per RECIST (version 1.1).  Radiologic tumor 
response and disease progression will be assessed by CT scan utilizing RECIST (version 1.1).  Assessments werebe performed at Screening, at9-week intervals (from C1D-2) thereafter. Following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, the tumor assessmentintervalmay 
be increased toevery 12 weeks from last scan until tumor progression;at investigator discretion, the interval between scans may be longer than 12 weeks but must not exceed 24 weeks.

12
Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Overall Survival (OS):   will be evaluated according to survival information and post treatment 
information (including therapy, dates of therapy and response) collected at two month intervals beginning 
on the date the subject is registered off study and until the endpoint of death, the subject is lost to follow-up or until the study termination by AbbVie.
PFS2:  will be evaluated according to survival information and post treatment information (includes 
dates of therapy and response per RECIST 1.1) collected at two-month intervals.
Statistical Methods:   Unless otherwise noted, for all statistical analyses, statistical significance will be 
determined by a two-sided Pvalue ≤ 0.05 when rounded.
Sample Size Determination:
Assuming the true hazard ratio for PFS in favor of the veliparib + C/P group is 0.69, a total of 344 PFS 
events will be needed for the study to have 90% power at 2-sided α level of 0.05 to detect a statistically 
significant treatment effect for the veliparib + C/P group using the log-rank test for progression free survival.  A total of approximately 500subjects will be enrolled into the study.
Efficacy (Primary and Secondary Endpoints):The analysis of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints will include only the subjects who have 
been documented to have suspected deleterious or deleterious mutations by the Sponsor core lab.  The primary and secondary analyses will be based upon the investigator's assessment of response and disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  Sensitivity analyses of PFS, ORR, and CBR based on radiological and clinical assessment by the Central Imaging Center will be conducted.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS):   will be defined as the number of days from the date the subject is 
randomized to the date the subject experiences disease progression, or to the date of death (all causes of 
mortality) if disease progression is not reached.
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR):   will be defined as the progression-free rate at 24 weeks from the 
Kaplan-Meier curve for time to progression (defined as from the date of randomization to the date of 
disease progression).
Overall Survival (OS):   Time to death for a given subject will be defined as the number of days from the 
day the subject is randomized to the date of the subject's death.  All events of death will be included, 
regardless of whether the event occurs while the subject is still taking study drug, or after the subject discontinues study drug.  If a subject has not died, then the data will be censored at the date when the subject is last known to be alive.
Objective Response Rate (ORR):   (CR and PR) will be defined as the proportion of subjects with a 
complete or partial objective response based on RECIST (version 1.1).  All subjects who have had at 
least one measurable lesion at baseline will be included in the ORR calculation.
PFS2:  will be defined as the number of days from the day the subject is randomized to the date that the 
subject has disease progression or death of any cause on the subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first.Safety:  Safety will be assessed by evaluating study drug exposure, adverse events, serious adverse 
events, all deaths, as well as changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign parameters.  Subjects who are randomized but do not receive study drug (veliparib or placebo) will not be included in the analyses of safety.  Safety analysis results will be presented by treatment group.

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Breast Cancer
Breast cancer (BC) is diagnosed in over 1.3 million women worldwide each year and 
accounts for over 500,000 deaths, making it the leading cause of cancer-related death in women.  Internationally, the incidence of breast cancer varies dramatically with North America, Australia, and Northern and Western Europe having the highest incidence and Eastern Europe having intermediate levels.
1  In the United States (US) and Europe, breast 
cancer is the most common cancer in women, with over 180,000 new cases in the US and 332,000 new cases in the countries of the European Union (EU-27) in 2008.
2,3  Although 
the number of agents approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer continues to increase, overall survival has changed relatively little and median survival remains unchanged, in the range of 2 to 3 years from initial diagnosis of metastatic disease.
With the development of gene expression array technology, the heterogeneity of breast 
cancer has become clearer and the identification of novel cancer subtypes has reinvigorated the search for more specific and effective therapies.  Additionally, identification of genetic characteristics has helped in identifying risk factors.  One of these genetic characteristics includes mutations or alterations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2.  It is estimated that at least 5% of breast cancer cases result 
from inherited mutations or alterations in BRCA1and BRCA.
2,4  Furthermore, women with 
these mutations have a lifetime risk of 40% to 85% of developing breast cancer.5  Males 
with BRCA2mutations also carry an increased risk of breast cancer.  Malignancies with 
deficiencies in homologous repair, such as BRCA1-and BRCA2 deficient tumors, are 
more susceptible to cytotoxicity induced by DNA damaging agents and are more dependent on PARP for DNA repair than normal cells.  This explains why BRCA1/2
mutated cells, which are defective in homologous recombination, are selectively more sensitive to a PARP inhibitor than wild-type cells.
6,7
Hierarchical clustering of genomic expression data from breast cancer specimens has demonstrated several distinct tumor subgroups with unique expression profiles, including 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
24
a HER2-positive subgroup, an estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subgroup, and a subgroup 
termed "basal-like"or "triple-negative."  A common feature of tumors in the basal-like subgroup is the lack of expression of ER, PgR, and HER2, resulting in the description "triple-negative breast cancer"(TNBC).  Although not all triple-negative breast cancers are basal-like, the classification of triple-negative tumors based on immunohistochemical staining is a clinically useful surrogate for the majority of basal-like breast cancer.  The majority of breast cancers with germline BRCA1mutations are of the triple-negative 
phenotype, and chemotherapy is the only current treatment option for these patients.
8  
Little progress has been made in identifying specific molecular pathways associated with TNBC that may be effectively targeted for therapeutic purposes and, consequently, this is an area of active research.
9,10  There is particular interest in the role of PARP inhibitors as 
well as alkylating agents and platinum-based chemotherapy as treatment for BRCA-associated TNBC.
In contrast to the BRCA1 carcinomas that often have the basal cell phenotype, the BRCA2
carcinomas are more similar to sporadic breast cancer and tend to be ER-and PgR-positive.  Treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer often involvessequencing of successive lines of endocrine therapy with either aromatase inhibitors (AI) or the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen.  In addition, exemestane with everolimus has demonstrated benefit in endocrine refractory patients.  However, up to one-third of subjects are primarily resistant to endocrine therapy and most subjects who initially respond to endocrine therapy will eventually become resistant.  Therefore, the vast majority of HR+ advanced breast cancer subjects will receive chemotherapy during the course of their disease.
A minority of BRCA-deficient tumors also express HER2 receptors (approximately 3%).
11  
The development of HER2-directed targeted therapy has changed the natural history of 
this subtype of breast cancer.  Adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab has consistently shown up to 50% reductions in risk of recurrence compared to non-trastuzumab–based therapy.
12  
In metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer, trastuzumab therapy results in improved survival when used in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy compared to paclitaxel 
Veliparib

alone.13  Pertuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the ligand-dependent 
dimerization of HER2 and its downstream signaling, was recently approved for the 
treatment of first-line HER2-positive metastatic BC and has become a standard first-line therapy.  An antibody drug conjugate, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, has also recently demonstrated an increase in PFS and OS in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed following trastuzumab and taxane chemotherapy.  Despite these important advances, many patients eventually progress, and additional treatment options are needed for HER2-refractory patients.
3.2 Carboplatin and Paclitaxel
Carboplatin is a commonly used platinum compound that acts by producing interstrand 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cross-links and, thus, interrupting cell division.  It is approved by the Food Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ovarian cancer and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for ovarian cancer of epithelial origin and small cell lung carcinoma.  It is also used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck cancer, endometrial cancer, metastatic seminoma, and more recently in breast cancer, with reported response rates of 20% to 50% in previously untreated patients with metastatic breast cancer.
14  Carboplatin is eliminated by renal 
excretion and the clearance is related to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  Therefore, it is dosed on the basis of GFR and the target area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC).  Myelosuppression is the dose limiting toxicity of carboplatin and is dose dependent.  Anemia may be cumulative and require transfusion support with prolonged therapy.  Anaphylactic-like reactions to carboplatin have been reported and may occur within minutes of carboplatin administration.  The risk of allergic reactions is increased in patients previously exposed to platinum therapy.  Other toxicities include nausea, vomiting, renal toxicity, and neurotoxicity.
Paclitaxel promotes the assembly of microtubule formation and stabilizes them by 
preventing depolymerization.  It is insoluble in water and, therefore, is formulated in cremophor.  Paclitaxel is approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer and is widely used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting.  It is also approved by the FDA for the 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
26
treatment of ovarian cancer, NSCLC, andKaposi's sarcoma.  It is administered as an 
intravenous (IV) infusion and can be used either on a 3-weekly schedule or a weekly schedule.  Main toxicities associated with the use of paclitaxel are myelosuppression and neuropathy.  Hypersensitivity reactions requiring treatment have occurred in 2% to 4% of patients receiving paclitaxel in clinical trials; thus, patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H
2antagonists.
Emerging data suggest that BRCA1/2-mutated tumors may be more sensitive to DNA 
damaging agents, including carboplatin.  Specifically, two studies by Bryski et al are relevant to the use of platinum agents for BRCA-associated breast cancer.  The first was a 
small prospective trial of single-agent neoadjuvant cisplatin in patients with BRCA1-and 
BRCA2-associated breast cancer and demonstrated a high pathologic complete response 
rate (9 of 10 patients; 90%).
15  The data were recently updated to include 25 patients in 
the expanded cohort, and it was found that the pathological complete response rate to be 72%.
16  The second study evaluated a cohort of 12 patients from the first study in 
comparison to retrospective data in patients with BRCA1-associated breast cancer who 
were treated with non-platinum regimens.  The pathological complete response rate across all regimens was 24% in the 102 patients with BRCA-deficient breast cancer; in contrast, 
the pathological complete response rate in the cisplatin-treated cohort was 83% (10 of 12patients; 95% CI = 54% –96%) and was far lower in the other aggregated regimens (14 of 90 patients; 16%, CI = 9% –25%).
17  The results from the TNT trial in metastatic 
or recurrent locally advanced triple negative breast cancer indicated greater sensitivity to carboplatin than docetaxel in germline BRCA mutation carriers (68% [17/25; 95%CI46.5 –85.1] versus 33.3% [6/18, 95%CI 13.3 –59.0] p = 0.03).
18  Thus, the use of 
platinum-based regimens may be particularly appealing in this population.
The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is widely used for the treatment of patients 
with advanced NSCLC, ovarian cancer, and other solid tumors.  Paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin is also highly active in breast cancer, with response rates of approximately 39% to 62% in first-line metastatic breast cancer.
14  Notably, data suggest 
that the administration of carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel results in less 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
27
thrombocytopenia than is expected from the use of carboplatin alone.19  Because of the 
increased sensitivity of BRCA-mutated tumors to DNA-damaging agents such as 
carboplatin, and the activity and potential platelet-sparing effects of paclitaxel, the 
combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel may have particular utility in patients with BRCA-mutated tumors.
3.3 Poly(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase (PARP) Mechanism of Action
Poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) is a nuclear enzyme that recognizes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and facilitates DNA repair.
20,21  Inactive PARPs 1 
and 2 bind to damaged DNA, which leads to their auto-activation.  The resulting activated PARP then poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates many nuclear target proteins, including those that facilitate DNA repair of both single-stranded or double-strandedDNA breaks.  Thus, PARP inhibition will result in less efficient DNA repair following a DNA damage insult.
DNA-damaging agents, including cytotoxic ch emotherapy and radiation therapy, remain a 
mainstay of treatment for many subjects with cancer.  Since cancer cells are genetically 
unstable, often exhibiting complex karyotypes that include large deletions, insertions, and unbalanced translocations of chromosomal fragment, these cells are more susceptible than normal tissues to cytotoxicity induced by DNA-damaging agents.
22  Of these, deficiencies 
in mismatch repair and homologous recombination are associated with the largest number of malignancies.  These deficiencies render cells more dependent on PARP for DNA repair and, hence, are more prone to cytotoxicity induced by PARP inhibition.
23  In 
particular, tumor cells with BRCA1 orBRCA2deficiencies are exquisitely sensitive to 
PARP inhibition, even in the absence of any other insults.6,24
3.4 Veliparib
Veliparib is a potent inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2.  When DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents are coadministered, veliparib inhibits the repair of DNA damage induced by these cytotoxic agents.  In addition, veliparib demonstrates single agent activity in tumors defective in DNA damage repair, such as BRCA1 -and BRCA2-mutated tumors.  A

detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be 
found in the Investigator's Brochure.38
3.4.1 Preclinical Experience
Veliparib is a novel small molecule that is a potent inhibitor of both PARP-1 and PARP-2 with K
is of 5 nM and 3 nM, respectively.  In cells under oxidative stress, veliparib inhibits 
the PARP induced formation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) with an EC 50of 2.4 nM.  
Consistent with the conclusion of mechanism-based efficacy, significant inhibition of PAR levels was observed with doses of veliparib capable of delivering significant antitumor efficacy in preclinical models.
Veliparib has been shown to enhance the efficacy of the combination of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel in several xenograft tumormodels.  As a single agent, carboplatin produces a dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in the MX-1 breast carcinoma xenograft model.  Veliparib administered at 50 and 100 mg/kg/day in combination with carboplatin given at 50 mg/kg/day (intraperitoneally [IP], QD Days 18, 25, 32) and with paclitaxel given at 10mg/kg/day (IV, QD Days 18, 25, 32) also regressed tumor volumes, whereas veliparib alone or carboplatin + paclitaxel did not ( Figure1).

Carcinoma Xenograft Model in SCID Mice
3.4.1.1 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
Preliminary clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data available from 6 studies indicate that 
exposure of veliparib is approximately dose-proportional over 10 through 500 mg BID dose range.  The absorption of veliparib after oral dosing is relatively fast where veliparib plasma concentrations peak atapproximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing across dose levels.  The terminal half-life of veliparib is about 6 hours, with minimal accumulation following multiple BID dosing.  Food does not have a significant effect on veliparib bioavailability.  The mean total urinary recovery of veliparib (as parent compound and M8 metabolite) is 86%, which indicates that renal excretion is an important pathway in veliparib elimination.
Potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of veliparib are being evaluated in veliparib 
combination studies.  Veliparib is not a potent inhibitor, nor an inducer, of the major human cytochrome P450s (CYPs), suggesting a minimal potential for DDIs at the anticipated therapeutic concentrations.

In Phase 0 Study A10-161, substantial inhibition of PARP activity was observed in tumor 
biopsies collected 3 to 6 hours after dosing in all 3 subjects who received a single dose of 25 mg veliparib (92%, 95%, and 100%).  Complete inhibition of PARP activity in PBMCs, maintained through 24 hours after dosing, was achieved in 3 of the subjects who received 50 mg veliparib.  For the 50 mg dose group, PARP activity inhibition in tumor biopsies averaged 75% 3 to 6 hours after dosing (N = 3) and averaged 74% 24 hours after dosing (N = 3).  Therefore, both 25 mg and 50 mg veliparib were found to be biologically active.
3.4.1.2 Toxicology
The toxicological profile of veliparib has been characterized in general toxicology studies 
of up to 6 months'duration in rats and 9 months'duration in dogs, in genotoxic studies (Ames assay, in vitro cytogenetics assay, in vivo micronucleus study), and in embryofetal development studies.  The primary target organs of veliparib exposure are the central nervous system (convulsions and other CNS-related signs), the hematologic system (decreased red and white blood cells), the bone marrow (hypocellularity), the lymphoid tissues (lymphocyte depletion), and the male (germ cell depletion) and the female (corpora lutea decrease and minimal degeneration of granulosa cells in follicles) reproductive tissues, with lesser effects on the cardiovascular system (10% QTc prolongation) and the gastrointestinal tract (single cell necrosis).  Convulsions and other CNS-related signs were considered exposure-dependent and were generally self-limiting, amelioratedby dose reduction or cessation of dosing, or respondent to treatment.  All other findings were dose-dependent and reversible upon discontinuation of veliparib administration.  Veliparib was genotoxic (induced chromosomal aberrations in vitro and increasedmicronuclei formation in vivo) and was toxic to the developing fetus (increased incidence of fetal, visceral, skeletal malformations and/or variations).
3.4.2 Clinical Experience
In combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors 
is to block repair of DNA that has been damaged by the cytotoxic agent, such as 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
31
carboplatin.  By a similar mechanism, PARP inhibitors may potentiate the toxicities of 
cytotoxic chemotherapies.  Thus, each veliparib combination regimen will have a unique set of toxicities that is predominately similar to that anticipated for the backbone regimen, and also, a unique recommended Phase 2 dose.  Due to this, multiple Phase 1 studies of veliparib in combination with various chemotherapeutic agents are being conducted.
The combination of veliparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been investigated in 
ongoing Phase 1 studies conducted in collaboration with the NCI CTEP.  In CTEP Study7967 the maximum dose administered in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors was veliparib 120 mg BID for 7 days in addition to carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m
2administered on Day 3 of a 21-day cycle with 2 out of 6 subjects 
developing protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at this dose.  The first DLT was grade 3 nausea lasting more than 48 hours after standard anti-emetic therapy; this event resolved with additional treatment.  The second DLT was grade 3 febrile neutropenia in a subject who previously received multiple cycles of dacarbazine (an alkylating agent which may cause cumulative bone marrow damage).  Both of these DLTs were reversible and manageable and did not lead to study treatment discontinuation due to toxicity.  Both febrile neutropenia and nausea are known toxicities ofcarboplatin + paclitaxel therapy and are known to resolve after standard therapies such as G-CSF, antibiotic therapy, anti-emetics, and well-defined dose reductions.  Preliminary data from CTEP 7967 indicate that 8 out of 14 subjects with metastatic breast cancer had confirmed responses (3 CR, 5 PR).
25  In CTEP Study 8620, veliparib was escalated 
beginning at 50mg PO BID to a maximum of 200 mg PO BID in combination with carboplatin (AUC2) and weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m
2) in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors, and the study is currently enrolling the expansion cohort of 6 to 12 patients with TNBC at the MTD (150 mg BID).  Dose-limiting toxicities included thrombocytopenia (veliparib 150 mg BID) and febrile neutropenia (veliparib 200 mg BID).
25  In a 
subsequent analysis of preliminary data in refractory triple negative breast cancer subjects receiving veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel on either a q-3week regimen (CTEP 7967) or a weekly regimen (CTEP 8620), an objective response rate of 50% was observed with the weekly regimen (2 CR, 3PR, n = 10) and an objective 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
32
response rate of 55% was observed with the q-3week regimen (2 CR, 4 PR).25  In the 
ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled Study M12-895 Phase 2 study, numerical 
increases in PFS and OS and increased ORR were observed with the addition of veliparib to carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to placebo with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer, supporting further evaluation in a larger Phase 3 trial.
Study GOG 9923 is an ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation study evaluating the safety and 
MTD of the combination of carboplatin (AUC 6, q-3week), paclitaxel (175 mg/m
2
q-3weeks or 80mg/m2weekly), bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, q-3week,initiated in Cycle 2) 
with escalating doses of veliparib on both an intermittent and continuous schedule in subjects with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.  Intermittent veliparib treatment is given for the first week of each cycle.  Preliminary safety datacommunicated by the investigator indicate Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia were DLT's in Cycle1 at a dose of veliparib 300 mg PO BID (intermittent schedule) with carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m
2q-3week, with no DLTs observed in the 200 mg BID or 
250 mg BID cohorts.  For subjects receiving intermittent veliparib in combination with carboplatin AUC 6 and weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m
2, no DLTs were observed at the 
100mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg BID dose levels; at both the 250 mg BID and 300 mg BID dose levels, 1 of 6subjects experienced a DLT (Grade4 thrombocytopenia).
Study Rationale
The therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors was suggested by two clinical trials 
evaluating PARP inhibition in breast cancer and one clinical trial in ovarian cancer.  In subjects with metastatic breast cancer, the addition of a PARP inhibitor (veliparib) to carboplatin resulted in responses in subjects with deleterious germline mutations in BRCA1/2, with an objective response rate of 54% (14/26), with four complete responses.  
A single-arm trial evaluated a PARP inhibitor in metastatic breast cancer subjects with BRCA1/2mutations and demonstrated single-agent activity, with an ORR of 38% in 
heavily pretreated subjects.
26  A similar trial in BRCA1/2mutation carriers with metastatic 
ovarian cancer showed a response rate of 33%.27  Together, these results validate the 
Veliparib

33
proof of concept that PARP inhibition is an attractive therapeutic target in breast and other 
cancers.
Therapeutic potential in breast cancer has also been observed with veliparib in 
combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel.  In Study CTEP 7967, the combination of veliparib with carboplatin + paclitaxel was well tolerated with a similar incidence of most toxicities, including hematological toxicities to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) carboplatin + paclitaxel study.
28  Preliminary data from this study indicate that 
8out of 14 subjects with metastatic breast cancer had responses (3 CR, 5 PR).28  In a 
subsequent analysis of preliminary data in refractory triple negative breast cancer subjects receiving veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel on either a q-3week regimen (Study CTEP 7967) or a weekly regimen (carboplatin AUC 2, paclitaxel 80mg/m
2; Study CTEP 8620), an objective response rate of 50% was observed with the 
weekly regimen (2CR, 3 PR, n = 10) and an objective response rate of 55% was observed with the q-3week regimen (2 CR, 4 PR).
30  The I-SPY 2 adaptive Phase 2 study explored 
5experimental agents (neratinib, veliparib, granitumumab, AMG 386, and MK-2206) in combination with weekly paclitaxel administration (+ trastuzumab if indicated) for 12weeks followed by standard 4 cycles of Adriamycin/cyclophosphamide given every 3weeks in the neoadjuvant setting.  Results reported for Study I-SPY 2 on 13December2013 at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium showed an increase of 26% in the pCR rate in subjects with triple negative breast cancer that had veliparib and carboplatinadded to standard of care (SoC) [pCR of 52% for veliparib + carboplatin + SoC versus 26% for SoC].
3.5 Benefits and Risks
This study proposes to establish improved clinical outcomes for patients with 
HER2-negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer with a suspected deleterious/deleterious germline mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 through the addition of veliparib to therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Preclinical data demonstrate that veliparib potentiates the anti-tumor activity of platinums, and data from early-phase clinical studies (completed or preliminary) are consistent with these observations.
Veliparib

34
Veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been investigated in three 
Phase 1 studies, an adaptive Phase 2 study, and tworandomized blinded Phase 2 studies.  Of these studies, preliminary efficacy data is available from the Phase 1 study conducted in advanced solid tumors (Study CTEP 7967) with durable responses observed in breast cancer (5 PR, 3 CR, n = 14), non-small celllung cancer (4 PR, 1 CR with an additional PR in a patient with SCLC, n = 16), and other advanced solid tumors (gastric, head and neck, melanoma, urothelial).  The most common treatment-emergent serious adverse event in studies with veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been neutropenia (4.5% of subjects) and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (> 30% of subjects) have been neutropenia, leucopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, nausea, anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.  These events have been similar in severity and nature to that anticipated for the backbone regimen of carboplatin/paclitaxel alone.
Gastrointestinal toxicities such as nausea and vomiting are the most common toxicities 
with veliparib single-agent therapy and have occurred in some subjects following a single dose.  Antiemetics may be used as per standard of care for nausea during the course of the study.  Anemia and decreased lymphocyte count have been observed in clinical studies with continuously dosed single agent PARP inhibitors, including veliparib.
Other potential risks of veliparib administration, identified in preclinical studies or based 
on pharmacological mechanism, but not confirmed in clinical studies must also be considered.  These risks include seizures, changes in testes/ovaries, toxicity to the developing fetus and secondary malignancies.
In summary, veliparib is an orally available PARP inhibitor that has been shown to 
significantly potentiate the effects of carboplatin/paclitaxel in multiple preclinical models of tumor progression.  Anti-tumor activities also were observed in early clinical studies.  Potential risks, as identified above, will be minimized by careful patient selection and monitoring.  The potential clinical benefit and the mitigation of potential risks to metastatic breast cancer patients support the evaluation of veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in this Phase 3 study.

The benefits and risks of study participation have been evaluated in the contextof the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. No data are available to characterize the risk of participation in this trial specific to COVID-19. COVID-19-related risks are not expected to differ substantially between trial participants and the broader population of individuals receiving treatment for advanced breast cancer. In consideration of the life-threatening nature of the disease under study, the benefit/risk balance for participation in this trial is not changed.
3.6 Differences Statement
This is the first randomized, Phase 3 study of veliparib in HER2-negative metastatic or 
locally advanced unresectable breast cancer in patients with clinically significant (suspected deleterious or deleterious) germline mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2.
4.0 Study Objectives
The primary objective of the study is to assess the PFS of veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in subjects with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in HER2-negative metastatic or locally advanced 
unresectable breast cancer.
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess overall survival (OS), clinical benefit 
rate (CBR) through the end of Week 24, objective response rate (ORR) and PFS2 in subjects treated with veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel versus placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
The tertiary objectives are to assess ECOG performance status, QoL, duration of overall 
response, and exploratory correlative endpoints.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study to evaluate 
the efficacy and tolerability of veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel insubjects with BRCA1 or BRCA2 
mutation as documented by the Sponsor core laboratory with HER2-negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer who have received no more than two prior lines of DNA-damaging cytotoxic therapy for metastaticdisease.  For the purposes of eligibility, HER2-negativity status will be based on the most recent tumor biopsy.  Approximately 200 research sites will participate.  Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1ratio to one of the two treatment arms with a total of approximately 500 subjects randomized.  Veliparib 120mg/placebo BID will be dosed Days –2 through 5 with carboplatin AUC 6 administered on Day 1 and Paclitaxel 80 mg/m
2administered weekly 
on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle.
Subject randomizationwill be stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone 
receptor (PgR) positive versus ER/PgR negative, prior platinum therapy (yes versus no), and CNS metastases (yes versus no).  Tumors with any detectable ( ≥ 1%) expression of 
ER and/or PgR by IHC are considered hormone-receptor positive.  Tumors with no detectable expression of ER and PgR are considered hormone receptor negative or endocrine non-responsive.  For subjects with heterogeneity between primary tumor and metastases, the biopsy most proximal to C1D-2 will be used for the purposes of stratification.  For subjects with de novo Stage IV disease, the receptor status of the primary tumor will be used for the purposes of stratification.
Blinded Study Treatment (Veliparib/Placebo + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel)
Dosing of oral veliparib/placebo will begin 2 days prior to the start of the 
carboplatin/paclitaxel infusion on C1D-2 and will continue twice a day (BID) through C1D5 (7 consecutive days).  All subjects will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel IV infusion of Day 1.  In addition, subjects receive paclitaxel IV infusion on Days 8 and 15.

Subjects will continue to receive veliparib/placebo in combination with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel until unacceptable toxicity occurs or radiographic progression occurs.  Subjects who experience toxicities due to carboplatin/paclitaxel or veliparib may requirea delay in dosing or dose modification as described in Section 5.7.
Subjects who discontinue carboplatin and paclitaxel and who have not progressed will receive single-agent, blinded veliparib/placebo starting at 300mg BID.  If the subject tolerates 300 mg BID for 2 weeks, veliparib/placebo may be increased to 400mg BID at the investigator's discretion.  Dosing with veliparib/placebo will begin onDay 1 and continue through Day 21 of a 21-day cycle.  For subjectswho have been receivingsingle-agent veliparib/placebo at a stable dose without adjustment for multiple cyclesand who have no ongoing study drug related uncontrolled AEs(Adverse Events),it is possible to

alternate on-site visits and phone visits every other cycle. Ata minimum, these subjects 
should have an on-site visit every other cycle. If an on-site visit is not possible for 2consecutive cycles, or if the subjectis not on a stable dose or hasongoing study drug-related uncontrolled AEsbut wishes to alternate on-site and phone visits every other cycle, theplan for the subject's visits should be discussed withthe AbbVie TA MD (see Section 7.0for contact information).  Subjects will continue to follow the schedule of 
assessments as outlined in AppendixC and AppendixF .
Subjects who have discontinued blinded study treatment due to unmanageable toxicity or for reasons other than progression will remain on study, off drug and follow a reduced schedule of study assessments which will include tumor assessments per RECIST 1.1 and survival statusassessments, until disease progression as outlined in AppendixE.
Once a subject discontinues blinded study treatment (including subjects that discontinued treatment due tounmanageable toxicity or for reasons other than progression), a Final Visit will be conducted.  All subjects will have a 30-Day Follow-Up Visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.  Follow-Up Visit procedures should be completed prior to starting any new anti-cancer therapy.  Subjects who have progressed on blinded study treatment may be eligible for unblinded veliparib monotherapy treatment as described below. 
Optional Unblinded Veliparib Monotherapy Treatment (Crossover)
Subjects will be eligible to receive unblinded veliparib monotherapy treatment upon 
confirmation of the following:
●Documented disease progression in EDC per RECIST 1.1; 
Note:  Discussion with the AbbVie TA MD (see Section 7.0for contact 
information) may be needed prior to unblinding and crossover to verify that 
criteria for unequivocal PD are met.
●Confirmation subject was receiving placebo during blinded portion of the study;
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
39
Transition to crossover treatment should occur within approximately 60 days following a 
confirmed event of progressive disease.  Transitions that occur after 60 days should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD. 
Unblinded veliparib monotherapy will start at 300 mg BID on Cycle 1 Day 1.  If the 
subject tolerates 300 mg BID for approximately 2 weeks, veliparib may be increased to 400 mg BID at the investigator's discretion.  For subjectswho have been receiving veliparib monotherapy at a stable dose without adjustment for multiple cyclesand who haveno ongoing study drug related uncontrolled AEs, it is possible to alternate on-site visits and phone visits every other cycle. At a minimum, subjects should have an on-site visit every other cycle. If an on-site visit is not possible for 2 consecutive cycles, or if the subjectis not on a stable dose or hasongoing study drug-related uncontrolled AEsbut wishes to alternate on-site and phone visitsevery other cycle, the plan for the subject's visits should be discussed withthe AbbVie TA MD (see Section 7.0for contact 
information). Subjects will follow the schedule of assessments as outlined in AppendixDand AppendixF . Subjects will continue on unblinded study treatment until a second 
diseaseprogression event or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
Subjects who have discontinued unblinded study treatment due to unmanageable toxicity 
or for reasons other than progression will remain on study, off drug and follow a reduced schedule of study assessments, which will include tumor assessments per RECIST 1.1 and survival status until disease progression as outlined in AppendixE.
Once a subject discontinues the unblinded study treatment (including subjects that 
discontinued treatment due to unmanageable toxicity or for reasons other than progression), a Final Visit will be conducted.  All subjects will have a 30-Day Follow-Up Visitapproximately 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.  Follow-Up Visit procedures should be completed prior to starting any new anti-cancer therapy.

Survival and Post Blinded and Unblinded Study Treatment Information
Once a subject meets study treatment discontinuation criteria, subjects will be followed 
for survival and post study treatment information as outlined in Section 5.3.1.1will be 
collected every two months (unless requested by sponsor more frequently to support data analysis) beginning on the date the subject is discontinued from therapy.  All randomized subjects should be followed for disease progression (PFS) and for the second progression (PFS2), until the endpoint of death (OS), until the subject has become lost to follow-up or until study termination by AbbVie.

(9)  The impact of veliparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel on the unborn fetus is unknown; 
therefore, these criteria ensure that adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy.
(10)  In accordance with harmonized Good Clinical Practice (GCP).
5.2.2 Exclusion Criteria
Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible:
1. Received anticancer agent(s) or an investigational agent within 21 days prior to 
C1D-2 or radiotherapy within 28 days prior to C1D-2.
●Prior treatment with palliative local breast or bone lesion radiation (other than 
pelvis) can occur, if administered at least 14 days prior to C1D-2.
●Anticancer hormonal therapy must be stopped 7 days before starting C1D-2.
●Anticancer therapy should not be initiated by the site during the screening period, as a 21-day interval would be needed from the last dose and would lead
to additional delays in therapy and potential exclusion of the subject.
2. Received more than 2 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., gemcitabine, 
doxorubicin, capecitabine) for metastatic disease.*
●Regimens received in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting or for locally advanced 
breast cancer within the past 6 months will also be considered toward the 
maximum of 2 prior lines of therapy.  Adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy for one cancer event will count as one prior line of therapy, if received within the 
past 6 months.
●Previous treatments with hormonal therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) 
and signal transduction agents (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib, everolimus, 
bevacizumab) are allowed and are not counted towards the prior line of 
therapy if not given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
3. Progressed or recurred within 12 months of completing platinum therapy or 
received >1prior line of platinum therapy for breast cancer in any setting 
(adjuvant, neoadjuvant or metastatic).

4. Subjects experiencing a significant adverse effect or toxicity (Grade 3 or Grade 4), 
causally attributed to previous anticancer treatment that has not recovered to at 
least Grade 2.
5. Prior therapy with PARP inhibitors.*
6. Prior taxane therapy administered for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with 
the below exceptions.*
●Prior taxane therapy for metastatic breast cancer is allowed if the patient 
received ≤ 1 full cycle (i.e., therapy discontinued within 4 weeks for subjects 
receiving weekly paclitaxel or Abraxane; therapy discontinued within 3 weeks 
for subjects receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel every 3 weeks) in the absence of 
progression or if taxane therapy for metastatic disease was > 12 months prior 
to C1D-2.
●Use of taxanes as adjuvant therapy or to treat locally advanced diseaseis 
permitted, if given more than 6 months prior to C1D-2.
7. Subjects with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.
●Subjects should have a brain MRI within 28 days of randomization to confirm 
the absence of CNS metastases.  Contrast CT is acceptable for subjects who 
are unable to undergo a brain MRI.
●Subjects with known brain metastases must have clinically controlled 
neurologic symptoms and have received previous adequate treatment, defined 
as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy with stable neurologic function 
and no evidence of Central Nervous System (CNS) disease progression as determined by comparing a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed during screening to a prior scan 
performed at least 4 weeks earlier and provided that the subject is asymptomatic, has no evidence of cavitation or hemorrhage, and does not 
require corticosteroids (must have discontinued steroids for management of 
neurological symptoms at least 3 months prior to study drug administration).
8. A history of uncontrolled seizure disorder, including focal or generalized seizure 
within the past year.

9. Pre-existing neuropathy from any cause in excess of Grade 1 (except focal 
neuropathy such as brachial plexopathy or carpal tunnel syndrome).
10. Major surgery within 3 weeks of randomization.
11. Known history of allergic reaction to cremophor/paclitaxel, carboplatin, 
Azo-Colourant Tartrazine (also known as FD&C Yellow 5 or E102), Azo-

12. Clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not limited to:
●Active infection;
●Symptomatic congestive heart failure;
●Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia;
●Myocardial infarction within last 6 months;
●Known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C with abnormal liver function tests or 
organ dysfunction;
●Uncontrolled hypertension (sustained systolic blood pressure >150 mmHg or 
diastolic pressure >100 mmHg despite optimal medical management);
●Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study 
requirements; or
●Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, places the subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.
13. A previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from 
breast cancer, except cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma carcinoma of the 
skin, or in situ carcinoma of the bladder or another in situ cancer that is considered cured by the Investigator.  Any cancer curatively treated more than 3years prior to entry is permitted.  For these subjects, metastases must be histologically or cytologically confirmed to be breast cancer.

* Note: For prior chemotherapy, treatment for 1 full cycle or less will not be 
considered as prior therapy unless the patient experienced progression of 
disease while on that therapy.
Rationale for Exclusion Criteria
(1 –12)  For the safety of the subjects.
(13)  To select the appropriate subject population with sufficient disease severity for 
evaluation.
(14)  The impact of veliparib and carboplatin or paclitaxel on pregnancies or breastfeeding 
is unknown.
5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at Screening, receives during the study, and up to 30 days following the last dose of study treatment must be recorded in source documents and the eCRFs.  The reason for use, dates of administration (including start and end dates), and dosage information (including dose and frequency) must be recorded.
For the purposes of this protocol, antitumor treatment may be defined as, but is not 
limited to, anticancer agents (cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy), radiotherapy, and investigational agents.  An investigational agent is any drug or therapy not currently approved for use in humans.
The AbbVie TA MD identified in Section 6.1.6should be contacted if there are any 
questions regarding prior or concomitant therapy(ies).
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
47
5.2.3.1 Prior Therapy
Anticancer Agents: Subject must have received no more than two prior lines of cytotoxic 
therapy for metastatic breast cancer.  
Regimens received in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting or for locally 
advanced disease within the past 6 months will also be considered towards the maximum of two prior lines of therapy.  If received within the past 6 months, adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy for one cancer event will count as one prior line of therapy.
Prior therapy with biologic agents including vaccines and 
immunostimulants are allowed.
Prior therapy with signal transduction agents such as EGFR/HER2-direct 
agents (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib, bevacizumab) are allowed and will not count toward prior lines of therapy if not given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Anticancer hormonal therapy is not permittedwithin 7 days prior to 
C1D-2 or during the study.
Radiation: Prior treatment with radiation is allowed as long as the last treatment was at least 28 days prior to C1D-2.  Prior treatment with palliative local breast or bone lesion radiation (other than pelvis) is allowed if the last treatment was at least 14 days prior to C1D-2.
5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
The locally approved product label, institutional guidelines, local practice, or applicable 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for carboplatin, and paclitaxel should be referenced for any concomitant therapy guidelines.
Premedication: To reduce the severity of hypersensitivity reactions due to treatment with 
paclitaxel, please manage according to institutional guidelines, the locally 
approved product label, local practice, or applicable SmPC (i.e.,premedication with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H
2
antagonists).
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
48
Anticancer Agents: Anticancer agents (including anticancer hormonal agents such as tamoxifen or 
aromatase inhibitors) are not permitted during the treatment portion of the study.  All subjects will receive carboplatin + paclitaxel with veliparib/placebo during the treatment portion of the study.  A subject receiving maintenance GnRH antagonists for ovarian suppression prior to the screening period may be allowed to remain on therapy.  This should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD.
The locally approved carboplatin and paclitaxel product labels or SmPCs 
should be referenced to determine if there are any contraindications associated with concomitant medications (e.g., yellow fever vaccine, phenytoin, etc.).  Caution must be exercised when a subject receives concomitant treatment with carboplatin and aminoglycosides due to increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity.  The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.  Caution should be exercised when paclitaxel is concomitantly administered with known substrates (e.g.,midazolam, buspirone, felodipine, lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenafil, simvastatin, andtriazolam), inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin), and inducers (e.g., rifampin and carbamazepine) of CYP3A4.  Caution should also be exercised when paclitaxel is concomitantly administered with known substrates (e.g., repaglinide and rosiglitazone), inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil), and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of CYP2C8.

M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
49
Supportive Care: Best supportive care and treatment will be given as appropriate to each subject 
(antiemetics, antibiotics, transfusions, nutritional support, non-radiation palliative treatment for pain) according to institutional guidelines or American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.
Bisphosphonate therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis and bisphosphonate 
or denosumab therapy for the management of bone metastases is allowed as per standard of care.  Bisphosphonate therapy intended for an anti-cancer effect is not allowed during the study.  If bisphosphonates or denosumab are initiated after randomization, the reason for its use must be clearly documented.  When possible, initiation of bisphosphonates or denosumab should be avoided during Cycle 1.
ASCO guidelines recommend a two drug combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone for moderately emetogenic therapies, such as carboplatin.  If palonosetron is not available, any of the first generation 5-HT
3receptor antagonists may be used, preferably ondansetron or 
granisetron.  ASCO dosing guidelines are as follows:
!Palonosetron 0.25 g IV OR 0.50 mg oral, Day 1 only
!Dexamethasone 8 mg (IV or oral), Days 1 to 3
Aprepitant is not recommended, though clinicians may consider its use.  
If clinicians opt to use aprepitant, dosing guidelines are as follows:
!Aprepitant:  125 mg Day 1, 80 mg Day 2 and Day 3
!5-HT3receptor antagonist dosing
!Dexamethasone:  12 mg on Day 1 only.31
Growth Factors: Biologic response modifiers administered for erythropoiesis 
(e.g.,erythropoietin, darbepoetin alpha) and colony stimulating factors (e.g.,G-CSF, GM-CSF, etc.) may be administered as supportive care or to maintain dose intensityor to avoid dose delays according to standard practice, institutional or clinical practice guidelines (e.g., ASCO, ESMO).  In the case of a dose modification in the treatment regimen due to WBC discrepancies growth factors (G-CSF) can be used to correct these discrepancies before a second dose modification.
Radiation: Palliative radiotherapy is only allowed during the study treatment period for a symptomatic bone lesion present at baseline and for which no radiographic progression is visible on radiographic assessments.  If a patient requires radiation therapy to a new lesion, that new lesion would, per RECIST 1.1, qualify as progressive disease.
Subjects should not be randomized with the intent to receive local therapy for 
breast cancer (i.e., not initially a locally advanced patient appropriate for neoadjuvant therapy or other therapy with curative intent).  If a subject becomes a candidate for local treatment with radiation therapy, this should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD and should be consistent with standard or institutional guidelines (a subject with multiple metastases is unlikely to benefit from local therapy).
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
50
Surgery: If the subject requires surgery during the study, timing of the procedure, study 
drug interruption, and resuming the study drug needs to be discussed with AbbVie TA MD.  Any diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure performed during the study period should be recorded including the dates, description of the procedure(s), and any clinical findings.
As a precautionary measure, it is recommended, but not strictly required, that 
if subjects require placement of a central venous access device (CVAD), that procedure should be done 7 days prior to first study treatment start.
Subjects should not be randomized with the intent to receive local therapy for 
breast cancer (i.e., not initially a locally advanced patient appropriate for neoadjuvant therapy or other therapy with curative intent).  If a subject becomes a candidate for surgical resection, this should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD and should be consistent with standard or institutional guidelines (a subject with multiple metastases is unlikely to benefit from local therapy).
Alternate Therapy No anti-cancer medicine/herbal (e.g., Chinese medicine/herbals) remedies may be taken concurrently with veliparib (a 14-day washout period must be documented).

5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in AppendixC, AppendixD, AppendixE , and AppendixF
are discussed in detail in this section, with the exception of the monitoring of treatment 
compliance (Section 5.5.6) and the collection of concomitant medication (Section 5.2.3) 
and adverse event information (Section 6.1).  All study data will be recorded within the 
EDC system.
For procedures performed at Screening and repeated, the later procedure performed prior 
to dosing will serve as a baseline for clinical assessment.  Subsequent study procedures (excluding labs) should be performed within four (4) days surrounding the scheduled study visit date.
Study visits may be impacted by changes in local regulations due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.  Every effort should be made to ensure the safety of subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study.  If visits cannot be conducted as outlined per the protocoldue to travel restrictions or other pandemic-related reasons, the site should contact the Sponsorfor further guidance.
Informed Consent
Signed informed consent will be obtained from the subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative in order to participate in this study.  The IRB/IEC-approved informed consent must be signed and dated by each subject prior to undergoing any study procedures or before any prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order for the subject to participate in this study.  Informed consent will be required for the optional exploratory research.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Subjects will be considered screen failures if the informed consent has been signed and after a study-specific procedure has been done (e.g., central laboratories drawn), but the subjectdoes not meet eligibility criteria.  The reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and will be captured in the eCRF.

M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70

Medical History
The following information will be collected during the Screening Visit:
●Complete medical history, including documentation of any clinically 
significant medical condition;
●History of tobacco and alcohol use;
●Presence and severity of any symptoms/conditions associated with metastatic breast cancer; and
●Detailed oncology history, including:
○Previous testing for BRCA1/BRCA2 germline testing and results of tumor 
profiling/molecular markers (if applicable)
○Date of primary cancer diagnosis;
○Pathology (histology or cytology) of primary tumor
○Surgical history;
○Anticancer and radiation treatments administered (including dates and type 
of modality);
○Metastasis information (including the location and histological markers), if applicable.
On C1D-2 any changes from the screening assessments, observed prior to dosing, will be 
recorded in the subject's medical history.  At each subsequent visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed and any clinically significant changes from baseline will be recorded in the source documents and on the adverse event eCRF.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination (PE), including height, will be performed at Screening.  
A symptom-directed PE, including weight, will be performed at all other visits, unless indicated otherwise.  Height will be measured at Screening only.  For height and weight assessments, the subject should not wear shoes.  If the Screening PE is performed within 7days of C1D-2, PE is not required on C1D-2, unless clinically indicated.  Clinically significant changes from baseline will be documented in the source documentation and 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4

54
eCRF as adverse events.  Physical exams should include clinical evaluation for 
progression with subsequent confirmation by CT.
12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12 lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit within 28 days of C1D-2 
(prior to the first dose of veliparib/placebo to document the baseline status of the subject) C1D1 and at each blinded and unblinded study treatment Final Visit if not performed within the last 4 weeks.  The C1D1 ECG must be obtained one hour after dosing with veliparib/placebo and prior to the paclitaxel or carboplatin infusions.  For subjects in the crossover treatment, the C1D1 ECG must be obtained one hour after dosing with veliparib.  A qualified physician will sign and date the ECGs, determine whether any findings outside normal physiological variation are clinically significant (in consultation with a cardiologist if necessary), and document this on the ECG report.  The original ECG tracing or copy with physician's assessment will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.
Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of heart rate, sitting blood pressure, and body temperature will 
be measured at all visits, unless indicated otherwise.  If possible, blood pressure and heart rate measurements should not take place immediately after scheduled blood collections.
Pregnancy Test (In Women of Childbearing Potential)
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be done at 
screening and a urine pregnancy test will be done prior to randomization (within 24hours).  A serum pregnancy test can be performed at C1D-2 and analyzed locally prior to randomization.  If a serum pregnancy test is performed on C1D-2, a urine pregnancy test does not need to be completed.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated during the study according country requirements.  Subjects considered not of childbearing potential must be documented as being surgically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12months).
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
55
If pregnancy results are equivocal (e.g., false positive due to B-hCG being a tumor 
marker) in subjects with evidence to support lack of pregnancy (e.g., surgically sterile), the results should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD and the investigator's interpretation along with supporting information documented in the source documents.
The C1D-2 urine pregnancy test results must be reviewed and determined to be negative 
prior to randomization.  If the urine pregnancy test is positive at C1D-2, it should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test and dosing should be delayed.
For female subjects of childbearing potential, who have prolonged interruption of therapy 
(> 3 months), a pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and confirmed to be negative prior resuming therapy.  In situations of suspected pregnancy, pregnancy testing will be performed as soon as possible.  In addition, pregnancy testing may be repeated at the discretion of the investigator and according to country requirements at any time during the study.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
All subjects will undergo the laboratory assessments outlined in Table4.
All laboratory samples will be assessed using a certified central laboratoryand these data 
will be used for all data analysis.  The central laboratory will provide instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shipping of samples.  All laboratory samples will be shipped to the central laboratory.
A certified local reference laboratory may perform complete blood count (CBC) and 
chemistry tests prior to dosing in each cycle to allow for immediate subject management; however, split or concurrent samples will be drawn and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  When necessary, local labs can be split and used to determine subject eligibility upon discussion with the AbbVie TA MD.  The appropriate certifications will be collected from both the central and local laboratories, as needed.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
56
Due to travel restrictions and otherchanges in local regulations in cases of state of 
emergency or pandemic or other special situations that prevent the site from collecting a Central Laboratory sample, if possible, sites should arrange for subjects to have laboratory work done at a local lab, hospital, or other facility.  Local lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and kept within the subjects'source documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed by the investigator as soon as possible.
If laboratory samples cannot be obtained per the protocol, thesite should discusswith the 
AbbVie TA MDprior to continuing dosing.
AbbVie may discontinue the requirement for concurrent samples to be sent to the central 
laboratory, and require instead local laboratory results onlyat protocol-specified timepoints, at any time during the course of the study.
Samples for chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be collected at all visits, unless 
otherwise indicated, as detailed below.  For Screening labs performed greater than 7 days prior to C1D-2, hematology/chemistry should be split at C1D-2 (with a 24 hour window) and local labs reviewed prior to dosing.  For Day 1 visits of each cycle after Cycle 1, study samples for central laboratory analysis may be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing.  For visits conducted by phone as outlined in AppendixF, lab tests do not need to 
be performed and are to be collectedat a minimum at the on-site visits(every other cycle).  For Day 8 and Day 15 visits (during blinded study treatment), study samples for central laboratory analysis may be performed within 24 hours from the scheduled day.  There is no visit window for C1D-2 as any sample prior to randomization is still considered to be screening.  A qualified (e.g., certification or accreditation) local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory analyses for treatment decisions and should be entered into EDC, but this cannot replace the central laboratory analysis on a protocol defined visit.
●Urinalysis samples will be collected at Screening, C1D-2 and at each blinded 
and unblinded study treatment Final Visit.
●APTT/INR will be collected at Screening.
Veliparib

●BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation testing will be collected on all subjects 
by the Sponsor core laboratory.
Qualified medical staff at the site will review, initial, and date all local and central 
laboratory results.  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers clinically significant will be followed, as appropriate.  Clinically significant laboratory values will be recorded as adverse events if they meet the criteria as specified in Section 6.1.

BRCA1 /BRCA2 Testing
BRCA1 and BRCA2 Germline Mutation Testing
The diagnosis of a suspected deleterious or deleterious BRCA1or BRCA2mutation must 
be documented prior to randomization and genetic risk assessment and counseling should 
proceed per NCCN guidelines or the standard policy of the institution.  A copy of the results (including non-Sponsor testing) will be needed for the site study file.  Subjects with BRCAvariants of uncertain significance or polymorphisms in BRCA1or BRCA2will 
not be eligible for the study.
Documentation of BRCAmutation status must occurby one of the following mechanisms 
prior to randomization:
●Previous diagnosis of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.
If the diagnostic testing for BRCA1/BRCA2 was not conducted by the Sponsor 
core laboratory, the investigator should ensure that the testing and 
classification is consistent with local guidelines and clinical practice and that 
the test employs either 1) direct DNA sequencing/MLPA or 2) a 
well-characterized methodology previously validated by sequencing, such as that used to assess founder mutations.  These subjects must also undergo 
Sponsor core laboratory BRCAgene sequencing during Screening or on
C1D–2.
Subjects with local labs indicating a suspected deleterious or deleterious 
mutation and who meet all of the eligibility criteria may be randomized prior 
to receiving results from the Sponsor core laboratory.
●Subjects considered high risk for carrying a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation are 
eligible for Sponsor core BRCAtesting.  Subjects may be considered high risk 
if they meet one of the following criteria (per the most current NCCN guidelines):
32
○Individual from a family with a known deleterious BRCA1/BRCA2 gene 
mutation;
○Personal history of breast cancer and one or more of the following:
●Diagnosed at age ≤ 45;
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
59
●Diagnosed at age ≤ 50 with:
○An additional breast cancer primary (i.e., bilateral disease or two or 
more clearly separate ipsilateral primary tumors);
○≥ 1 close blood relative with breast cancer at any age;
○≥ 1 close relative with pancreatic cancer;
○≥ 1 relative with prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7);
○An unknown or limited family history; 
●Diagnosed at age ≤ 60 with a triple negative breast cancer;
●Diagnosed at any age with:
○≥ 1 close blood relative with breast cancer diagnosed at age ≤ 50;
○≥ 2 close blood relatives with breast cancer at any age;
○≥ 1 close blood relative with ovarian carcinoma;
○≥ 2 close blood relatives with pancreatic cancer and/or prostate 
cancer (Gleason score ≥  7) at any age;
○A close male blood relative with breast cancer;
○For an individual of ethnicity associated with higher mutation 
frequency (e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish) no additional family history 
may be required; 
○Personal history of epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal 
cancer;
○Personal history of male breast cancer;
○Personal history of prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7)at any age with 
≥1close blood relative with breast and/or ovarian cancer and/or pancreatic 
cancer or prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7) at any age;
○Personal history of pancreatic cancer with ≥ 1 close blood relative with 
breast and/or ovarian cancer and/or pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer 
(Gleason score ≥  7) at any age.
Note:  Patients who pre-qualify with one or more of these criteria will be eligible to screen 
for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation by the Sponsor core laboratory.  These subjects may be 
eligible for randomization upon receipt of documentation of a suspected deleterious or 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
60
deleterious germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation by the Sponsor core laboratory.  Germline 
mutation testing obtained greater than 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2 will not preclude a 
subject from randomization.
BRCA Bridging Sample
In order to permit future bridging studies to other potential BRCAassays, in addition to 
the sample collected for the Sponsor core laboratory BRCAtest, two tubes of blood must 
be obtained from all subjects per Table2to be tested at a future date.
Tumor Assessments (Radiologic)
Appropriate diagnostic CT assessments using modified RECIST version 1.133for solid 
tumor response will be used in the evaluation of cases, as appropriate.  If the subject is 
unable to undergo a CT scan with IV contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency, a non-contrast CT may be performed if the disease, especially potentially measurable lesions as present, can be appropriately evaluated.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may replace the CT imaging in cases where local laws or requirements mandate, but should have sponsor or central imaging center approval prior to performing the MRI.
Axial plane CT scans of the full chest, abdomen, pelvis (or MRI), and brain MRI or 
contrast CTto determine the extent of tumor burden were performed for all tumor assessments at Screening (within 28 days of randomization), and every 9 weeks from C1D-2 (tumor assessments could be conducted 5 days prior or 5 days following the scheduled assessment) until progression. For subjects in the blinded treatment period, following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, the tumor assessmentintervalmay be increased to every 12 weeks from last scan (tumor assessments may be conducted 10 business days prior or 10 business days following the scheduled assessment). At the investigator's discretion, the interval between scans may be longer than every 12 weeks for subjects who have durable disease control but must not exceed 24 weeks.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
61
For subjects on open-label crossover veliparib, tumor assessments will be conducted 
every 9 weeks(± 5 business days) from C1D 1.  Following the primary analysis and 
implementation of Protocol Amendment 4,if a crossover subject has disease control after 6scanswhile following the 9 week scan interval schedule, the tumor assessment frequency can be increased to every12 weeks(± 10 business days) from the last scan. At the investigator's discretion, the interval between scans may be longer than every 12weeks for subjects who have durable disease control, but must not exceed 24 weeks.
Subjects who have discontinued study treatment due to unmanageable toxicity or reasons 
other than progression will remain on study but off drugand continue to complete scheduled tumor assessments until unequivocal progression per RECIST 1.1 is documented as per AppendixE.
Scheduled tumor assessments willnot be affected by delays in therapy and/or drug holidays.  Subjects will continue to be monitored by the same diagnostic method throughout the study, unless evidence of tumor metastasis warrants otherwise.
Post baseline brain MRI or contrast CT is only required in subjects with CNS lesions at 
baseline; in all other subjects, CNS imaging will be obtained as clinically indicated based upon symptoms indicative of CNS disease.  Coronal or sagittal plane imaging may be acquired for paraspinal findings and other lesions that may be better appreciated in that plane.  Measurements should only be performed on axial imaging and lesions followed in non-axial planes should be assessed qualitatively only.
Baseline full body bone scan is required for study entry.  Subsequent bone scans will be 
performed, as clinically indicated or per the institution's standard of care.  A new bone lesion requires detection of new area of lysis, cortical destruction, or increasing soft tissue component.  New bone scan lesions will not beconsidered as PD, unless confirmed as increasing destruction/lytic on CT/MRI.  Increasing sclerosis will not be considered PD.  New lesions or increasing sclerosis of existing bone lesions (flare) must be evaluated by CT/MRI.

Subject treatment management will be based on the tumor assessment review by the local 
investigator and/or site staff.  If the investigator's assessment of progression is equivocal, the subject should remain on study until subsequent assessment demonstrates unequivocal PD per RECIST 1.1 is documented.  
In addition to being reviewed by the investigator and/or site staff, radiology scans will be 
sent to a central imaging center (PAREXEL Informatics) within 1 week during the course of the study and in cases of suspected PD, within 2 daysof collection for review.  The central imaging center will provide instructions regarding the preparation and shipment of the images.  Imaging sent to the central imaging center should also include any unscheduled bone scan, PET-FDG or X-ray acquired by the sites for study purposes.  Radiology scans will be assessed by the central imaging center according to RECIST (version 1.1) as outlined in Section 5.3.4.1.  Interpretations from the central imaging 
center will not be sent to the site.  It is recommended that subjects remain on study until the investigator and/or site staff receives notification from AbbVie that the assessment of PD has been completed.  AbbVie may discontinue the requirement for radiology scans to be sent to the central imaging center or the requirement for completing central reviews at any time during the course of the study.
ECOG Performance Status
ECOG performance status will be assessed as outlined in AppendixC, AppendixD , 
AppendixE, and AppendixF .

Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Questionnaires
To assess the subject's health-related quality of life and symptoms, the EORTC QLQ C30, 
the EORTC BR23, and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ 5D 5L) (AppendixG, AppendixH and AppendixI , respectively) will be administered pre-dose at, 
C1D-2, C1D1 (unblinded veliparib monotherapy treatment only), every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 2 (C2, C4, C6, etc.), each blinded and unblinded study treatment Final Visit and at each blinded and unblinded study treatment 30-Day Follow-Up Visit.  In addition, to assess pain more specifically, theBrief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire ( AppendixJ) will be administered pre-dose at C1D-2, C1D1 
(unblinded veliparib monotherapy treatment only), Day 1 of every cycle, each blinded and unblinded study treatment Final Visit and each blinded and unblinded study treatment Follow-Up Visit.  To minimize response bias, all PRO questionnaires will be administered before subjects are informed of their tumor assessment.  Subjects must complete the questionnaires on paper forms, which are then entered into EDC by the investigator or designee.  The Investigator or a designee will need to check the form returned by the subject for completeness before the subject leaves the clinic.  For subjectswho are eligible to alternate on-site visits and phone visits, the PRO questionnaires should still be completed at the phone visits.  PRO questionnaires to be completed for the cycle during which the phonevisit occurs should be provided to the subject by the investigator or 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
64
designee during the preceding on-site visit, so these can be completed at homeas outlined 
in the schedule of assessments in AppendixF.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire that consists of a global health status/QoL scale, a financial difficulties scale, five functional scales (cognitive functioning, social functioning, physical functioning, emotional functioning, and role functioning), and eight symptom scales/items (fatigue, insomnia, appetite loss, pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea, and nausea and vomiting).  The EORTC BR-23 is a breast cancer–specific questionnaire and is meant for use complementary to the generic EORTC QLQ-C30 for patients with different disease stages and treatment modalities.
34  It 
comprises of 23 items divided in four functioning scales (body image, sexual functioning, sexual satisfaction, and future perspective) and four symptom scales (side effects of systemic therapy, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, and upset by hair loss).  The questionnaire has been validated in an international study.
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D 5L)
35is a generic preference instrument that 
has been validated in numerous populations.  The EQ-5D 5L is composed of 5 questions 
and a visual analog scale (VAS) assessing overall health that can be converted into a single health status or "u tility"score for use in an economic evaluation to adjust life-years 
gained by the subject's health-related quality of life.
The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), originally developed to assess cancer 
related pain in clinical trials, is one of the most widely used measurement tools for assessing clinical pain.
39  The BPI-SF allows patients to rate the severity of their pain and 
the degree to which their pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and any local restrictions, sites may administer PRO 
questionnairesover the phone as needed.  Sites may read the PRO questions and response options to the subject and record the subject's responses.  Sites may send the questionnaires (email or hard copy) to the subjects to allow them to read/understand the questions and responses when the subject is providing responses over the phone.  The date 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
65
and time of PRO data collection should be recorded along with who collected the 
information.
Randomization and Subject Number Assignment
The site will contact the IVRS/IWRS to obtain a screening (subject) number once the 
subject has signed the informed consent and a study-specific procedure has been performed (i.e., central labs drawn).  Once the screening number is assigned, if the subject is not randomized into the study, the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and will be captured in the eCRF.
Subjects who complete all Screening procedures and meet the eligibility criteria in 
Section 5.2and none of the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2.2will proceed to 
randomization.
A bottle number randomization schedule and a subject randomization schedule will be 
generated by the Clinical Statistics Department at AbbVie prior to the start of the study.  A copy of all randomization schedules will be kept by the Clinical Statistics Department at AbbVie and a copy will be forwarded to the IVRS/IWRS vendor.
Dispensing Study Drug
The IVRS/IWRS will assign bottles of veliparib or placebo and vials of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel that are supplied by AbbVie to be dispensed to a subject during the study from the available supply at the site.  Prior to each scheduled drug dispensation visit (per AppendixCand AppendixD ), site personnel must contact the IVRS/IWRS for the bottle 
number assignments no more than 5 days before Day 1 of each cycle.  Study medication 
cannot bedispensed unless the IVRS/IWRS is contacted.  AbbVie or the designee will 
provide specific instructions on the use of the IVRS/IWRS.
Subjects will be provided with self-administration instructions and subject dosing cards.  
Subjects will be instructed to store veliparib or placebo according to specific directions included in Section 5.5.2.2.  Subjects should return bottles of veliparib or placebo (empty, 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
66
partially filled, or full) to the study site prior to each cycle and each blinded and unblinded 
study treatment Final Visit.
Depending on local regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, provision of study drug 
for direct-to-patient (DTP) and direct-frompatient (DFP) transfer will be available upon request.  AbbVie has contracted with third party vendors for sites to ship study drug DTP and DFP.  Sites will be able to use the third party vendor and/or another local courier for drug shipment, as needed.  If necessary, notify AbbVie if DTP and/or DFP shipping will be used. 
Sites will be responsible to:
●Meet IRB/IEC reporting requirements and submit the booking form (which 
will be provided to site by the courier) to the local IRB/IEC, as applicable.
●Submit the booking form at least 72 business hours before the drug needs to be 
picked up, or as per the requirements of the courier.
●Discuss the DTP and DFP process with the subject including:
○Obtain consent to provide delivery information to the courier and 
document this in the source.
○Obtain results of required safety procedures before registering subject dispensation of study drug in IRT.
○Confirm the subject will be available to accept delivery.
○Confirm the subject will maintain the drug containers, as well as any unused drug for return to site.
●Follow up with the subject after shipment is received.
●Retain documentation of the shipment for IP accountability and monitoring.
Blinded Study Treatment
Subjects will receive sufficient quantities of veliparib/placebo for 7 days of administration 
in each 21-day cycle.  Subjects should start treatment with veliparib/placebo within approximately 48 hours of randomization.  At C1D-2, subjects will be given 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
67
veliparib/placebo for dosing through Day –1.  At C1D1, subjects will be given 
veliparib/placebo for dosing through Day 5 and additional study drug for Cycle 2 Days –2 and –1.  For subsequent cycles, subjects will receive veliparib/placebo for Days 1 –5 of the current cycle and a separate bottle for Days –2 and –1 of the following cycle.  This dispensing schedule will allow subjects to begin veliparib/placebo dosing prior to receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel infusions without requiring a return to the investigative site on Day –2.
Trained site personnel will administer the carboplatin + paclitaxel intravenously on Day 1 
and paclitaxel on Days 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle.  Subjects will be supervised at the time of the infusion. 
If carboplatin or paclitaxel is obtained commercially via the site pharmacy, the site will be 
responsible for tracking the lot numbers for all carboplatin and paclitaxel dispensed and include the information in the trial master file (TMF).
On Day 1, subjectson blinded single-agent veliparib/placebo will be given study drug for 
dosing throughDay 21.
For subjects who are eligible to alternate on-site visits and phone visits every other cycle, 
during theon-site visits, theinvestigator or designee should dispense blinded study drug via IRT and subject dosing cards for 2 consecutive cycles, as outlined in the schedule of assessments in AppendixF .
Unblinded Study Treatment
Subjects will receive sufficient quantities of unblinded veliparib for 21 days of 
administration in 21-day cycle.  At C1D1, subjects will be given unblinded veliparib for dosing through Day 21.  For subsequent cycles, subjects will receive unblinded veliparib monotherapy for Days 1 –21 of the current cycle.
For subjectswho are eligibleto alternate on-site visits and phone visits every other cycle, 
during the on-site visits, the investigator or designee should dispense unblinded study

68
drugvia IRT and subject dosing cards for 2 consecutive cycles, as outlined in the schedule 
of assessments in AppendixF .
Post-Progression/Survival Follow-Up Information
Once a subject meets study treatment discontinuation criteria, subjects will continue to be followed during the Post Treatment Follow-Up Phase for survival (i.e., the date and cause of death) and post-therapy information, including date of progression to the first post-study therapy.  These data will be collected on the appropriate eCRF at 2 month intervals (or as requested by Sponsor to support data analysis), beginning on the date the subject discontinued from study therapy until the endpoint of death, the subject has become lost-to follow-up, or AbbVie terminates the study.
The following will be collected for post-therapy information:
●Name(s) of post-therapy regimens;
●Post-therapy dates of initiation and completion;
●Date of progression onthe first post-study therapy (PFS2);
●Response to subsequent therapies and reason for discontinuation.
The investigator must report the withdrawal to the IVRS/IWRS system within 3 days of 
the subject's discontinuation.  Following entry into the Post Treatment Follow-Up Phase, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment. 
Subjects who have discontinued study treatment due to unmanageable toxicity or reasons 
other than progression will remain on study, off drug and continue to be followed for survival and post-treatment therapy informationat 2 months intervals (or as requested by Sponsor to support data analysis) as outlined in the schedule of assessments in AppendixE.
Subjects who wish to withdraw specifically from survival follow-up must have the request 
documented in the subject's medical record and signed by the investigator.  If the subject withdraws from the Post Treatment Follow-Up, the study staff may use public 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4

69
information source (such as county records) to obtain information about survival status 
only per local regulations, as appropriate.
5.3.1.2 Collection and Handling of Biomarker and Exploratory 
Research Samples
Blood and tissue samples will be collected for biomarker and optional exploratory 
research.  Subjects may still participate in the main study even if they decide not to participate in optional exploratory research.
All biomarker and exploratory research samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined 
in the study-specific laboratory manual.  AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the biomarker and exploratory research samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on Veliparib (or drugs of this class), this disease and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion.  The procedure for obtaining and documenting informed consent for exploratory research samples is discussed in Section 9.3.
Biomarker Samples
Plasma and blood for BRCA bridging will be collected at time points as outlined in 
Table2and may be utilized to evaluate known and/or novel markers (nucleic acids, 
peptides/proteins and/or metabolites) of disease status, related conditions or to evaluate the association with pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy.  The biomarker rationale will be discussed in the Biomarker Research Variables Section (Section 5.3.8).
Collection of Optional Exploratory Research Samples
Pharmacogenetic Sample (Optional) for Exploratory Research
One 4-mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected at C1D-2 (during the 
blinded study portion) from each subject who consents to provide samples for exploratory research.  If the sample is not collected at C1D-2, the sample may be collected at any time 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
70
throughout the study.  PG samples will notbe collected during unblinded veliparib 
monotherapy treatment.
Pretreatment Tissue Biopsy-Archived or Fresh Tissue Biopsy for Exploratory 
Research (Optional)
If available, fixed samples from most recent pathological analysis will be collected from 
subjects (with consent) at C1D-2.  Only one of the following forms of pre-treatment tumor tissue (archived tissue or fresh biopsy) is required:
●Pretreatment Biopsy-Archived
●Fresh Tumor Tissue Biopsy
The most recent archived biopsy is preferred and should be obtained during Screening if possible.  If no archived material is available, a fresh biopsy may be collected from subjects who consent according to Institutional procedures for subjects.  If a fresh biopsy is collected, it should be fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin according to Institutional procedures.  While sending FFPE blocks is preferred, slides prepared by the local pathology laboratory are acceptable and should be prepared as described in the study specific laboratory manual.  Tumor samples should be stored according to Institutional procedures until shipment to AbbVie or an AbbVie-designated contract research organization (CRO).
Included with each shipment should be a copy of the pathology report with all subject-
identifying information redacted and completed shipment inventory form.  Tissue slides will be shipped in slide boxes.  Slide boxes should be packaged using suitable shipping materials and sent to AbbVie at ambient temperature.
Post Treatment Tumor Biopsy for Exploratory Research (Optional)
An optional post treatment tumor tissue biopsy should be collected at the blinded study 
treatment Final Visit.  Institutional procedures should be followed to fix and embed the collected biopsy in paraffin.  While tissue blocks are preferred, slides prepared by the

local pathology lab are acceptable and should be prepared as described in the subject 
specific laboratory manual.
Included with each shipment should be a copy of the pathology report with all subject-
identifying information redacted andcompleted shipment inventory form.  Tissue slides will be shipped in slide boxes.  Slide boxes should be packaged using suitable shipping materials and sent to AbbVie at ambient temperature.
5.3.2 Drug Concentration Measurements
Pharmacokinetic variables are discussed in Section 5.3.6.
5.3.2.1 Collection of Samples for AnalysisBlood samples for determination of plasma concentration of veliparib will be collected at 
time points as outlined in Table3.  The date and time of sample collection and the date 
and time of the last 2 doses of veliparib will be captured on the eCRF.  Approximately 3mL of blood will be collected by venipuncture into one 3-mL potassium (K
2) EDTA 
(purple cap) tube in conjunction with clinical lab blood draws (if possible).  Sufficient blood will be collected to produce approximately 1 mL ofplasma for each sample.  The date and time of collection for each sample will be recorded.  Plasma should be transferred into one 2 mL Greiner tube.
If an indwelling catheter of any type is used, approximately 3 mL volume of blood must 
be collected and discarded prior to collection of the veliparib sample.  The use of indwelling catheter for the collection of pharmacokinetic samples is discouraged unless it is absolutely necessary.
Samples should not be collected when subjects are on a dose interruption.

5.3.2.2 Handling/Processing of Samples
The complete process of centrifugation, transfer to polypropylene tubes, and freezing 
should be accomplished within 120 minutes from blood draw.  The processing of pharmacokinetic samples should be performed, as described below:
●Collect the blood sample in a 3-mL EDTA (purple top) tube.
●Immediately invert the collection tubes 8 to 10 times.
●Within 60 minutes from blood draw, centrifuge sample at 1100 to 1300 × g for 
10 minutes at 2° to 8°C.  If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, samples 
can be centrifuged under room temperature conditions.
●Transfer plasma into an appropriately labeled (drug name, type of sample, 
protocol number, subject number, treatment cycle and day, and the planned 
time of sample collection relative to dosing, and the sample collection date) 
screw-capped polypropylene tube and freeze at –20°C or colder.
●Plasma samples must be frozen upright at –20°C or colder within 2 hours after 
collection and must remain frozen until shipped frozen to the central 
laboratory.  Samples should not be allowed to thaw prior to arrival at the central laboratory.
5.3.2.3 Disposition of Samples
Samples and inventory sheet should be batch shipped frozen to a designated laboratory on 
dry ice sufficient for 3 days.  Samples should notbe allowed to thaw prior to arrival at the designated laboratory.  Shipment information will be provided in the laboratory manual.
5.3.2.4 Measurement Methods
Plasma concentrations of veliparib will be determined under the supervision of the Drug 
Analysis Department at AbbVie.

5.3.3 Efficacy Variables
The primary efficacy endpoint will be PFS.  The secondary efficacy endpoints will be OS, 
CBR, ORR, and PFS2.  The tertiary endpoints will include DOR, change in ECOG performance status, and change in QoL indices.
5.3.4 RECIST (Version 1.1) for Tumor Response
Response criteria will be assessed using RECIST (version 1.1).  Changes in the target and 
non-target lesions over the course of therapy must be evaluated using the criteria listed below.
Eligibility
Subjects with measurable or non-measurable (but radiologically evaluable) disease with at 
least one lesion outside previously irradiated areas at baseline can have objective tumor response evaluated by RECIST (version 1.1).  Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable (target) lesion in at least one site which has not received prior radiotherapy.  Lesions that have been previously irradiated will be considered non-target lesions.  If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology, if possible.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
74
Measurability
Measurable Lesions Lesions accurately measured in at least one dimension with a minimum 
size of:
Longest diameter ≥  10 mm (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 
5mm)
10-mmcaliper measurement by clinical exam
Non-Measurable Lesions All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, and abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques.
Measurable Malignant Lymph NodesTo be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At Baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.
Non-Measurable Malignant Lymph NodesPathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis.
Special Considerations Regarding Lesion MeasurabilityBone lesions
Bone lesions are considered non-target/non-measurable lesions.
Cystic lesions
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.
"Cystic lesions"thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area will be considered 
non-target lesions.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
75
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and not more than 28 days prior to randomization.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at Baseline and during follow-up.
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers.  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.  All measurements should be taken using calipers and recorded in metric notation, if clinically assessed.  When lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken, since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
Methods of Measurement
Conventional CT should be performed with contiguous axial cuts of 5 mm or less in slice 
thickness for tumors of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.  A scale should be incorporated into all radiographic measurements.  MRI can be performed if required by local law, but must have sponsor/central imaging center approval.  Non-axial slices may be of value in the interpretation of paraspinal lesions findings and other lesions that are better appreciated in non-axial planes.  Lesions followed on non-axial imaging should be assessed qualitatively (i.e., as CR, Non-CR/Non-PD, unequivocal PD, unequivocal new, NE).  Lesions only visible on non-axial imaging are not considered suitable as target lesions.
For accurate objective response evaluation, ultrasound or bone scan should not be used to 
measure tumor lesions.
The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
76
Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between benign and malignant fluid 
collections in cases of new and/or enlarging pleural effusion and/or ascites in which the response will be based on other target or non-target lesions.  New effusions or ascites should be considered unknown until cytology confirms whether they are benign or malignant.  If cytology is available and suggesting malignancy, the data must be entered into the eCRF and will be considered in the determination of progression.  While fluid collections are present, the response determination cannot be considered CR.
Baseline Documentation of "Target" and "Non-Target" Lesions
All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at Baseline.  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy are considered non-target lesions.
Lymph nodes merit special mention, since they are normal anatomical structures, which 
may be visible by imaging, even if not involved by tumor.  Pathological nodes, which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions (no more than 2 may be selected), must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ 15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short 
axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge whether a node is involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as 2 dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an abdominal node, which is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered 
non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (SOD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum SOD.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then, as noted above, 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
77
only the short axisis added into the sum.  The baseline SOD will be used as reference by 
which to characterize the objective tumor response.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, CNS 
metastases and skin lesions, should be identified asnon-target lesions and should also be recorded at Baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence (stable, increasing, or decreasing) or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR)
The disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR)
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD)
At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest SOD recorded since the treatment started (baseline or after) or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Stable Disease (SD)
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest SOD since the treatment started (baseline or after).
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
78
Assessment of Target Lesions
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane asthe baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the "sum"of lesions may not be zero, even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  For PR, SD, and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at Baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (< 5 mm).  However, sometimes target lesions or lymph nodes become too small to measure.  If it is in the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the radiologist believes that the lesion is present, but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (as derived from the 5-mm CT slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible; therefore, providing this default value will prevent false responses or progression based upon measurement error.
If interventions occur during the study that affect disease burden, such as surgery, the 
lesion(s) affected will typically be considered non-evaluable (NE) from that point forward and subsequent time points will be either NE or PD (if evidence of progression is available).
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR)
The disappearance of all non-target lesions.  All lymph nodes mustbe non-pathological in 
size (< 10 mm short axis).

Non-CR/Non-PD
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s).
Progressive Disease (PD)
Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
In this setting, to achieve "unequivocal progression"on the basis of non-target disease, 
there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest "increase"in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease, therefore, will be extremely rare.
New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression.  While there are no 
specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions, the findings of a new lesionshould be unequivocal, i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, timing of scanning, phase of contrast administration, change in imaging modality, or possibly representing something other than tumor (e.g., some "new"bone lesions may besimply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions).  A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at Baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.
If a new lesion is equivocal (e.g., too small to measure), continued therapy and follow-up 
evaluation will clarify whether it truly represents new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

5.3.4.1 Definition of Disease Progression
Disease progression will be defined as progression of disease by RECIST (version 1.1).
If the subject experiences symptomatic deterioration and clinical progression is 
determined by the investigator, every effort will be made to document radiographic or clinical evidence of progression for analysis of the primary endpoint, even after discontinuation of treatment.  Thus, all randomized subjects should be followed for disease progression and for the second progression (PFS2), death, or withdrawal of consent for follow up until PD.

Clinical data that support progression will be collected and submitted for central review, 
including the following:
●Data on palliative radiotherapy and/or surgery/resection while on study, 
including specific location, date and results, as applicable;
●Biopsy or cytology, including reason, date and pathology result(additional 
assessment eCRF);
●Redacted reports on any lesions on off-protocol modalities, such as x-ray or FDG-PET, including specific locations, dates and status;redacted reports should only include data on imaging not submitted for review;
●Skin lesion reports (using the study approved form) will be provided by investigative sites for any lesions assessed by physical exam.
Clinical data provided to the central independent reviewers (additional assessment eCRF 
and Lesions Assessed by Physical Exam form) will not include information on images submitted for central review or information indicative of the site's assessment of tumor status (PD).
5.3.5 Safety Variables
AbbVie will assess adverse events, laboratory data, and vital signs throughout the study.  
Adverseevents will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 Published:  May28, 2009 (v4.03:  June 14, 2010).
During the conduct of the study, the AbbVie medical and safety team will be monitoring 
subject laboratory results, adverse event and serious adverse event data, as it is reported.  Medically significant changes in vital signs and ECGs will be reviewed, as available.
An IDMC reviewed unblinded safety data intermittently prior to the primary analysis.  No 
additional reviews by the IDMC will occur since the Sponsor management team was unblinded after completing the primary analysis.
Please refer to Section 8.1.8for further details pertaining to the IDMC review.

5.3.6 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Collection and shipment of PK samples is discussed in Section 5.3.2.
Values for compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters of veliparib such as rate of 
absorption (Ka), apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and oral clearance (CL/F) may be estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effect population modeling approach with NONMEM software and reported in a separate pharmacokinetic report.  Additional analyses may be performed, if useful in the interpretation of the data.
AbbVie or a designated laboratory will store the PK samples in a secure storage space 
with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  To increase confidence in trends, remaining sample aliquots may be used to perform replicate tests or sample analysis may be performed at additional time points for tests currently identified in the protocol.  Upon completion of this research, AbbVie or a designated laboratory will destroy the samples.
5.3.7 Exploratory Research Variables
Optional blood and tissue samples may be collected to conduct exploratory investigations 
into known and novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, proteins, lipids or metabolites.  The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of factors influencing the subjects'response to the study drug (or drugs of the same or similar class) or the development and progression of the subjects'disease or related conditions.  The samples may also be used to develop new diagnostic tests, therapies, research methods or technologies.  The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be included with the study report.  Samples will be collected to conduct exploratory analyses to investigate biomarkers.
5.3.8 Biomarker Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and response may be evaluated in this protocol 
with the goal of exploring the relationship between tumor response and/or disease status.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
83
Biospecimens collected may be evaluated for genetic lesions whether they occur by 
amplification, chromosomal loss and/ormutational/methylation with the intent of identifying potential associations with subject outcome or to better characterize the disease.  These characterizations may be included, but are not limited, characterization of gene methylation/mutational status or copy number changes of genes, particularly those involved in DNA repair pathways.
Biospecimens may be evaluated for levels of biomarkers including nucleic acids, 
proteins/peptides and metabolites.  For example, protein analysis of relevant proteins, including but not limited to, DNA repair proteins, such as ERCC1 and XPF, may be performed on tumor tissue obtained from each consented subject.
Samples collected during the course of this study may be banked and used in the future to 
investigate new scientific questions related to this study.  Additionally, the samples may be anonymized and used for diagnostic test development.  AbbVie (or a designated laboratory) will store the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on veliparib (or drugs of this class) continues for up to but no longer than 20 years.
BRCA Bridging Sample
In order to permit future bridging studies, additional samples will be collected to allow 
testing using additional assays to assess assay performance compared to other potential BRCAassays to be tested in the future.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Subjects will receive therapy until disease progression according to Section 5.3.4, 
RECIST 1.1, unmanageable toxicity (per discussion with the AbbVie TA MD), or they 
meet the study treatment discontinuation criteria as outlined below.  Subjects who discontinue therapy for reasons other than disease progression will continue to be followed as per a modified scheduled of assessments per AppendixE.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
84
Each subject has the right to withdraw from study treatment at any time.  In addition, the 
investigator may discontinue a subject from the study treatment at any time for any reason if the investigator considers it necessary, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.  Each subject will discontinue study treatment, if any of the following occur:
●The subject experiences disease progression as defined by RECIST 
(version1.1).
●Clinically significant deterioration of the subject's medical status, as 
determined by the investigator.  
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject;
●The subject requires alternative anticancer agents for primary or metastatic disease;
●The subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding during the treatment portion of the study;
●The subject or subject's legally acceptable representative decides to withdraw 
consent for any reason; or
●Any other medical reason that AbbVie or the investigatordeems appropriate.
Criteria for study discontinuation include:
●The subject experiences unequivocal disease progression as defined by RECIST (version 1.1) on blinded therapy and does not meet criteria for 
proceeding to the unblinded portion of the study, or experiences unequivocal disease progression as defined by RECIST (version 1.1) on unblinded therapy;
●The subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding during the treatment portion of the study; or
●The subject or subject's legally acceptable representative decides to withdraw 
consent for any reason.

M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
85
In cases of state of emergency or pandemic situations, if subjects withdraw consent from 
study treatment, they should be considered as on study,off drug and follow the schedule of assessments per AppendixE, if the subject consents to continued follow up.
When a subject discontinues either the blinded or unblinded study treatment, a Final Visit will be conducted.  During a Final Visit, the reasons for the discontinuation from the study treatment will be recorded and a physical examination, vital signs measurement, laboratory analyses, performance status, ECG (if not performed within the last 4 weeks), QoL assessment, collection of unused study drug, and an assessment of adverse events will be performed.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  
Allsubjects will have a 30-Day Follow-Up Visit approximately 30 days after the last dose 
of study treatment.  Follow-Up Visits should not precede a Final Visit.  Subjects starting any new cancer therapy within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment should complete the 1 month follow-up assessments in advance of starting any anti-cancer therapy.  Assessments performed within the 7 days prior to the 30-Day Follow-up Visit do not need to be repeated, unless further study treatment was administered or a test result was abnormal.  The 30-Day Follow-Up Visit does not need to be performed for subjects who have had a Final Visit conducted ≥ 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.
When a subject discontinuation is planned without the subject reaching a protocol-defined endpoint, the investigator will notify the AbbVie TA MD or the clinical team representative (Section 6.1.6) via telephone, as soonas possible (provided, in each case, 
subject care and safety are not compromised).  If not notified prior to discontinuation, the AbbVie TA MD may contact the site to discuss the reason for withdrawal from the study.
If a subject is discontinued from study treatment with an ongoing adverse event or an 
unresolved clinically significant laboratory result, the site will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory results or adverse event is achieved.

M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
86
In the event that a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the administration of study 
treatment to that subject must be discontinued immediately.  The site must report the pregnancy by telephone within 24 hours to one of the AbbVie representatives listed in Section 7.0.  Discontinued subjects will not be replaced.
5.4.1.1 Discontinuation of Blinded Study Treatment 
(Veliparib/Placebo + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel)
Subjects will receive veliparib/placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel until reaching a protocol defined event of disease progression or they experience unmanageable toxicity.  Dose reductions of carboplatin and paclitaxel will occur on the basis of the toxicity observed and may result in discontinuation of either agent (e.g., discontinuation of paclitaxel for neurotoxicity).  The subject may continue on therapy with the remaining agent in combination with veliparib/placebo.  Discontinuation of carboplatin and paclitaxel in the absence of toxicity requiring dose modification should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD.  Subjects who discontinue carboplatin and paclitaxel and who have not progressed will receive blinded veliparib/placebo as a single agent starting at 300 mg BID.
Carboplatin and paclitaxel administration will continue after veliparib/placebo has been 
discontinued.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site,for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his or her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped for reasons of safety.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
87
The following procedures for discontinuation must be followed:
●If the Sponsor has decided to prematurely discontinue the study, the Sponsor 
will promptly notify in writing the investigator, as well as regulatory 
authorities of the decision and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation;
●The investigator must promptly notify the IRB/IEC and give detailed reasons 
for the discontinuation; and
●The investigator must promptly notify the enrolled subjects of the premature 
discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments, such as replacement of 
the treatment regimen by other appropriate regimens, if applicable.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive one of the following blinded 
treatments:
●Veliparib + Carboplatin and Paclitaxel
●Placebo + Carboplatin and Paclitaxel
General chemotherapy guidelines are found in AppendixL.
Veliparib/Placebo
Subjects will self-administer veliparib/placebo twice daily (with the morning and the evening doses approximately 8 –12 hours apart) with or without food in the same calendar day for Days –2 through 5 of the 21-day cycle during the blinded study treatment portion.  Dosing of veliparib/placebo on Day 1 of every cycle should be done before carboplatin + paclitaxel infusion.
Subjects who discontinue chemotherapy will self-administer veliparib/placebo twice daily 
(with the morning and the evening doses approximately 8 –12 hours apart) with or without food in the same calendar day for Days 1 through 21 of the 21-day cycle.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
88
Subjects in the unblinded veliparib monotherapy treatment will self-administer twice daily 
(with the morning and the evening doses approximately 8 –12 hours apart) with or without food in the same calendar day for Days 1 through 21 of the 21-day cycle.
If the subject vomits within 15 minutes of taking veliparib/placebo, another dose should 
be administered.  It is recommended that if a subject misses a scheduled dose of veliparib and less than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the dose should be taken immediately.  It is recommended that if more than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the subject should not take the missed dose, but should wait and take the next regularly scheduled dose.
Paclitaxel
All subjects should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H 2
antagonists according to institutional guidelines, the locally approved product label, local 
practice, or applicable SmPC.
Paclitaxel will be administered intravenously over approximately 1 hour at a dose of 
80mg/m2on Day 1, 8 and 15 of every cycle.  Paclitaxel will be infused prior to 
carboplatin on Day 1.  Dosing of veliparib/placebo should alwaysbe done before the carboplatin or paclitaxel infusion.
If needed per dose modifications guidelines, it is recommended that growth factors (i.e., 
filgrastim, peg-filgrastim) dosed according to institutional standard will be administered daily subcutaneously starting 24 –72 hours after the last dose of carboplatin/paclitaxel or after last dose of weekly paclitaxel.  Pegfilgrastim should not be used for subjects receiving Day 15 paclitaxel as they do not have a 2-week chemotherapy-free interval.
Carboplatin
Carboplatin will be administered intravenously over approximately 15 to 30 minutes at 
(AUC 6 mg/mL/min) immediately following paclitaxel infusion on Day 1 of every cycle.  The duration of carboplatin infusion may be lengthened according to institutional 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
89
guidelines.  Dosing of veliparib/placebo should always be done before the carboplatin or 
paclitaxel infusion.
Maximum carboplatin dose will be capped as follows:Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/mL/min) × (150 mL/min)
●For a target AUC = 6, the maximum dose is 6 × 150 = 900 mg
●For a target AUC = 5, the maximum dose is 5 × 150 = 750 mg*
●For a target AUC = 4, the maximum dose is 4 × 150 = 600 mg*
* Only for subjects who have had dose modifications.Serum creatinine as provided by the central laboratory isbased upon the IDMS method.  
Use of the central laboratory creatinine result for the calculation of estimated GFR and the Calvert formula for carboplatin dosing is strongly encouraged, with the maximum carboplatin dose capped as above.  If the central laboratory value of plasma creatinine is not available at the time of carboplatin dose calculation, the local value may be used.
Similarly, when the GFR is estimated using isotopic/EDTA clearance, maximum 
carboplatin dosing should be based upon standard guidelines and institutional practices (e.g.,AUC –1).  In subjects with a low serum creatinine (less than 0.7 mg/dl), the creatinine clearance should be estimated using a minimum value of 0.7 mg/dl.
eGFR determined according to local practice will be capped at a maximum of 
125mL/min/1.73m
2.  If a subject experiences toxicity that would lead to dose reduction of 
carboplatin to an AUC of < 4, carboplatin will be discontinued.  Note that carboplatin dose will be recalculated if the subject has a weight change ofgreater than or equal to 10% from baseline; adjustments for weight change of < 10% are allowed per institutional guidance.  In the absence of renal toxicity greater than or equal to CTCAE Grade 2 (serum creatinine >1.5 × ULN) or toxicity requiring dose modification, the dose of carboplatin will not need to be recalculated for subsequent cycles, but will be subject to dose modification for toxicity as noted in the protocol.

If needed per dose modifications guidelines, it is recommended that growth factors (i.e., 
filgrastim, peg-filgrastim) dosed according to institutional standard will be administered daily subcutaneously starting 24 –72 hours after the last dose of carboplatin/paclitaxel or after last dose of weekly paclitaxel.

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects in study will be randomized to the blinded portion of the study by an 
IVRS/IWRS.  Before the study is initiated, each site will be provided with directions for the IVRS/IWRS.  The site will contact the IVRS/IWRS to obtain a Screening (subject) number once the subject has signed the informed consent anda study-specific procedure 
has been performed (i.e., central labs drawn).  Once the screening number is assigned, if the subject is not randomized into the study, the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and in the eCRF.
Subjects who complete all Screening procedures and meet the inclusion criteria in 
Section5.2, and none of the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2.2will proceed to 
randomization.  The site should access the system on or within 2 days prior to the subject's C1D-2 visit to randomize the subject.
The IVRS/IWRS will randomize subjects in a 2:1 ratio, between the veliparib 
BID+carboplatin + paclitaxel arm and the placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel arm.  Subject randomization will be stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesteronereceptor (PgR) positive versus ER/PgR negative, prior platinum therapy (yes versus no), and CNS metastases (yes versus no).  Tumors with any detectable ( ≥ 1%) expression of 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
93
ER and/or PgR by IHC are considered hormone-receptor positive.  Tumors with no 
detectable expression of ER and PgR are considered hormone receptor negative or endocrine non-responsive.  For subjects with heterogeneity between primary tumor and metastases, the biopsy most proximal to C1D-2 will be used for the purposes of stratification.  For subjects with de novo Stage IV disease, the receptor status of the primary tumor will be used for the purposes of stratification.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms.
Subjects will self-administer veliparib/placebo twice daily (with the morning and the 
evening doses approximately 8 –12 hours apart) with or without food in the same calendar day.
Subjects will return to the site on Day 1 of each cycle to have carboplatin and paclitaxel 
administered intravenously.  In addition subjects will return to the site on Days 8 and 15 of each cycle to have paclitaxel administered intravenously.
5.5.5 Blinding
This is a double-blind study.  AbbVie, the investigator, the study site personnel, and the 
subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment with veliparib/placebo until progression of disease.  Subjects who discontinue study treatment because of disease progression as defined by Section 5.3.4have the option to be unblinded to determine 
eligibility for unblinded veliparib monotherapy (crossover).  Following progression of disease, a separate unblinded study team was responsible for study conduct and data monitoring for subjects who crossed over to veliparib monotherapy. 
After completion of the primary analysisthe sponsor was unblinded to treatment 
assignment. A separate unblinded study team is no longer responsible for study conduct and data monitoring for subjects who crossover to veliparibmonotherapy.  Primary site monitors, investigators and subjects continue to be blinded to treatment assignment until 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
94
disease progression, after which unblinding to determine eligibility for crossover can be 
requested.
5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product
The IVRS/IWRS will provide access to blinded subject treatment information for an 
individual during the double-blind period.  The AbbVie TA MD (listed in Section 6.1.6) 
must be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study drug is required for medical emergency, i.e., situation in which the knowledge of the specific blinded treatment will affect the immediate management of the subject's conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  AbbVie must then be notified within 24 hours of the blind being broken.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  In the event the AbbVie Clinical Project Team should break the blind, the reason will be documented in a note to study file and on the appropriate eCRF.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his or her designated and qualified representatives will administer and 
dispenseveliparib/placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  Veliparib, placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel must not be used for reasons other than those described in the protocol.
Veliparib/placebo should be taken as directed by the investigator.Carboplatin and paclitaxel will be administered intravenously by trained site personnel.Subjects will be instructed to return all veliparib/placebo bottles (empty, partially filled, or 
full) to the study site personnel prior to each cycle and at each blinded and unblinded study treatment Final Visit.  The study site personnel will document the bottles/cartons of veliparib/placebo returned and the number of capsules per bottle/carton on the appropriate form.  The bottles/cartons will be retained until the site monitor performs accountability 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
95
of veliparib/placebo, carboplatin (when supplied by AbbVie), and paclitaxel (when 
supplied by AbbVie).
The study coordinator will documentsubject study drug administration details on the 
appropriate eCRF.  If the number of capsules taken and the number of capsules returned do not add up to the number of capsules dispensed, an explanation will be provided.
Unless otherwise directed by the investigator at the site, a subject will be considered 
compliant with veliparib/placebo if 80% of the assigned dose is taken during a cycle.  Compliance below 80% will require counseling of the subject by study site personnel.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
Upon receipt of a shipment, the representative at each site will 1) open and inspect the 
shipment; 2) verify that the veliparib, placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel has been received intact, in the correct amounts, and at the correct address; 3) sign and date the Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar documentation accompanying the shipment; and 4)register the shipment as received via the IVRS/IWRS.  All study drugs must be retained in the designated secure area under proper storage conditions.  This will be documented by signing and dating the POR or similar document or via direct recording in the IVRS/IWRS.
An overall accountability of veliparib, placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel supplied by 
AbbVie will be performed and verified by the site monitor via IWRS throughout the study and at the study site closeout visit.  An accurate running inventory of veliparib, placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel supplied by AbbVie will be kept by the site in the IWRS and will include the lot number, POR numbers, the bottle/carton numbers, and the date veliparib, placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel were dispensed for each subject.
Upon completion or termination of the study, all original bottles/cartons containing 
unused veliparib, placebo, carboplatin, paclitaxel (empty containers will be defaced and discarded onsite) will be returned to AbbVie according to AbbVie's instructions, or if 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
96
pre-arranged between the sponsor and site, destruction of used and unused veliparib, 
placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in bottles/cartons will be performed at the site.
The investigator or his or her designated representative agrees not to supply veliparib, 
placebo, carboplatin, or paclitaxel to any persons not enrolled in the study or not named as a sub-investigator listed on the FDA 1572 or IIA form.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability 
of veliparib in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel compared to an active, placebo controlled arm of carboplatin + paclitaxel in subjects with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BRCA-Associated breast cancer.  The choice of the control group allowed for a blinded assessment of the contribution of veliparib to the safety and efficacy of the backbone regimen of carboplatin + paclitaxel.  In addition to paclitaxel being an approved agent for breast cancer, emerging data indicate enhanced sensitivity of BRCAmutated cells to platinums; thus, there is potential for increased 
activity of this regimen in this population.
The randomization will be 2:1.  Randomization will be stratified by estrogen receptor 
(ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive versus ER/PgR negative, prior platinum therapy (yes versus no), and CNS metastases (yes versus no).  Tumors with any detectable(≥ 1%) expression of ER and/or PgR by IHC are considered hormone-receptor positive.  
Tumors with no detectable expression of ER and PgR are considered hormone receptor negative or endocrine non-responsive.

5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard pharmacokinetic, statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized 
in this study.  The efficacy measurements in this study are standard and validated.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
Documented BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with histologically(or cytologically) 
confirmed HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer will 
be enrolled into the study.  Subjects must have had no more than two prior DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy agents for metastatic disease.  Subjects must have measurable or non-measurable (but radiologically evaluable) disease as defined by modified RECIST (version 1.1).
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The combination of veliparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been investigated in 
ongoing Phase 1 studies conducted in collaboration with the NCI CTEP.  CTEP 7967 enrolled subjects who are chemotherapy-naive as well as subjects who received previous DNA damaging chemotherapy including platinum compounds.  In this study, the maximum dose administered is veliparib 120 mg BID for 7 days in addition to carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m
2administered on Day 3 of a 21-day cycle (regimen based 
upon standard of care for non-small cell lung cancer).  Chemotherapy is administered on the third day of veliparib treatment to ensure steady state levels of veliparib (and thus maximal inhibition of PARP for given dose) at the start of chemotherapy treatment.  Toxicities were as expected with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral neuropathy.
29  Weekly paclitaxel is 
standard therapy for breast cancer. The safety and tolerability of veliparib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin has been evaluated in study GOG 9923; current dose levels for intermittent veliparib are 300mg BID with both q-3week carboplatin/paclitaxel (1/7 DLT at 300 mg BID, febrile neutropenia) and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel (1/6 DLT at 250 mg BID; G4 thrombocytopenia), further supporting the tolerability of the 120 mg BID dose.  The proposed study will allow subjects who discontinue chemotherapy to 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
98
continue with single agent veliparib starting at 300 mg BID and if tolerated, escalate to 
400 mg BID administered continuously.  This dose has been selected based upon the recommended Phase 2 dose (CTEP 8282) and additional safety and efficacy data in Phase2 studies in BRCA -mutation carriers with breast cancer (CTEP 8264) or ovarian 
cancer (GOG 280), in which durable responses were observed to single agent therapy.
The maximum dose of veliparib for any subject under this protocol is 120 mg BID in 
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel and 400 mg BID as monotherapy.
5.7 Dose Reductions or Delays
The intention is for veliparib/placebo to be administered concurrently with carboplatin + 
paclitaxel.  Thus, if a delay in any component of the regimen is required for any reason, all drugswithin the regimen should be delayed until the subject is eligible to receive all drugs.  All toxicities, with the exception of anemia, alopecia, and non-treatment related clinically insignificant laboratory abnormalities, should be resolved to Grade 1 orlower or to baseline if Grade 2 is present at the time of study entry prior to initiation of a new cycle of therapy.  Neuropathy should be resolved to Grade 1 or lower to initiate a new cycle of therapy, unless paclitaxel has been previously discontinued.
If chemotherapy must be withheld because of hematological toxicity, CBC should be 
obtained at least weekly until the counts reach the lower limits for treatment as outlined.  
The AbbVie TA MD is to be contacted for subjects who require cycle delays of >28 days 
due to toxicity.
Study drug interruptions for events that are clearly not related to the study drug, 
e.g.,underlying cancer, planned surgical procedures, or acute viral illnesses, do not necessitate a dose reduction.  The timing of dose resumptionshould be at the investigator's discretion.  
Dose reduction for fatigue will only be done if the fatigue is deemed to be study 
drug-related in the investigator's opinion.

In the case of delays, interruptions or study treatment discontinuation, tumor assessments 
should have continuedat intervals of 9 weeks from C1D-2.  Following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, the tumor assessmentinterval may be increased to every 12 weeks (or not to exceed 24 weeks for subjects with durable disease control, at investigator discretion)from last scan.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, temporary study drug interruption may occur.  The
AbbVie TA MD is to be contacted for subjects who require cycle interruptions of >28days.
5.7.1.1 Carboplatin + Paclitaxel Dose Reduction and Delays
If a dose reduction or delay is required for carboplatin and/or paclitaxel, the investigator 
should follow procedures according to institutional guidelines, the locally approved product label, local practice, or applicable SmPC.  The dose levels and guidelines for dose modifications based on prior studies with veliparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel appear in Table7, Table8, Table9 , and Table10 , respectively.
Table 7. Dose Levels for Veliparib/Placebo + Carboplatin/Paclitaxel
Dose Level Carboplatin Paclitaxel* Veliparib/Placebo
Starting Dose Level AUC 6 80 mg/m2120 mg BID
Dose Level –1 AUC 5 70 mg/m280 mg BID
Dose Level –2 AUC 4 60 mg/m240 mg BID
* Discontinuation of the Day 15 paclitaxel infusion for hematological toxicities (per Table8) will be considered a 
dose reduction and will be maintained in subsequent cycles.
It is recommended that treatment on Day 1 of each cycle proceeds only if ANC is ≥1500cells/mm
3and the platelet count is ≥ 100,000/mm3. Recommended dose 
modifications/delays based on hematologic toxicities on Day 1 are outlined in Table8. 
For subjects with an ANC of 1000 –1499/mm3or platelet count 75,000 –99,999/mm3on 
Day 1, dosing may continue without modification or delay until recovery, at investigator discretion, if drug-related toxicity has been ruled out.  If ANC is below 1000/mm
3or the 
platelet count is below 75,000/mm3, treatment should be delayed until recovery.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
100
For subjects receiving paclitaxel on the second and third week of the cycle, ANC must be 
≥ 1000/mm3 and platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3on Day 8 and Day 15 of the cycle.  If counts are 
lower thanthis, treatment for that day will be omitted with reassessment of hematological counts 1 week later.  Dose reductions as outlined in the tables will be used in the following cycle.  Within a given cycle, if the Day 8 dose is omitted and the counts recoverby Day 15, the Day 15 dose may be given.  If the ANC and platelet counts have not recovered sufficiently for the Day 15 paclitaxel infusion to be administered, therapy may be resumed with the subsequent cycle once the hematological counts have recovered (the intent is to maintain a 21-day cycle).
Carboplatin and paclitaxel are to be delayed if veliparib/placebo was not taken by the 
subject on Day –2 and Day –1.  In such a case, a new supply of veliparib/placebo is to be dispensed, and Day –2 and Day –1 areto be repeated for that cycle.
For any Grade 3 or 4 toxicities not mentioned in Table8, Table9 and Table10 treatment 
will be withheld until the patient recovers to Grade 1 or baseline, and thedose of the 
drug(s) most likely to have caused the toxicity will be reduced.  Re-escalation of therapy on combination chemotherapy is not permitted.

5.7.1.2 Veliparib or Placebo Dose Reductions and Delays in 
Combination with Carboplatin + Paclitaxel
The following are guidelines for dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation of 
veliparib/placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Dose reductions are outlined below and subjects will continue to follow the schedule of assessments as outlined in AppendixC.
1. For any subject who experiences Grade 3/4 toxicity which is not attributable to 
carboplatin/paclitaxel or the underlying disease, the veliparib/placebo dose is to be held until the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or lower or to baseline if Grade 2 is present at the time of study entry.  Upon resuming veliparib/placebo treatment, the dose is to be reduced one dose level.  Any dose reduction below 40 mg BID is to result in veliparib/placebo discontinuation.
2. Carboplatin and/or paclitaxel administration will continue after veliparib/placebo 
has been discontinued.
3. Veliparib/placebo administration will continue after carboplatin and paclitaxel 
discontinuation (Section 5.7.1.3).  Subjects who discontinue carboplatin and 
paclitaxel due to toxicity and protocol-defined dose modifications and who have not progressed will receive single-agent, blinded veliparib/placebo starting at 300mg BID.  The treatment plan for subjects who experience a robust and durable response (such as a confirmed CR following 10 or more cycles of therapy) and for whom the investigator considers the potential risks of continued cytotoxic chemotherapy outweigh the benefits should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD prior to initiating single-agent blinded veliparib/placebo.
4. If a subject begins veliparib/placebo on Day –2, but subsequently experiences an 
event requiring the delay of the carboplatin/paclitaxel dosing on Day 1, the subject is to stop veliparib/placebo dosing immediately.  Upon resolution of the event, the subject may restart the current cycle by repeating Day –2 and Day –1.  For such delays, a new veliparib supply will be dispensed to restart the cycle at Day –2.

should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD.
5.7.1.3 Blinded Veliparib/Placebo and Unblinded Veliparib 
Monotherapy Dose Reductions and Delays
Subjects who discontinue carboplatin and paclitaxel and who have not progressed may receive single-agent, blinded veliparib/placebo starting at 300 mg BID.  Subjects will continue to follow the schedule of assessments as outlined in AppendixC.  In addition, 
subjects who progressed while on placebo may crossover to unblinded veliparib monotherapy and will follow the schedule of assessment as outlined in AppendixD.  If 
veliparib was discontinued previously in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, the subject can resume veliparib/placebomonotherapy dosing if symptoms resolve to ≤ Grade1.  If veliparib/placebo monotherapy is initiated, the starting dose should be 
300mg BID for 2weeks followed by an increase to 400 mg BID, if well tolerated.
The following are guidelines for dose reductions, delays and discontinuation of blinded 
veliparib/placebo or unblinded veliparib monotherapy.  Dose reductions are outlined in Table11.
It is recommended that treatment on Day 1 of each cycle proceeds only if ANC is ≥1500cells/mm
3and the platelet count is ≥ 100,000/mm3.  Dosing may continue in 
subjects with ANC and/or platelet counts ranges of ANC of 1000 –1499/mm3or platelet 
count 75,000 –99,999/mm3without modification at investigator discretion if drug-related 
toxicity has been ruled out.
For any subject who experiences Grade 3 or 4 toxicity despite optimal supportive care and 
the toxicity is not attributable to underlying disease, the veliparib/placebo dose will be held until the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or lower or to baseline if Grade 2 is present at the time of study entry.

The dose of veliparib/placebo will be reduced by one dose level for subjects experiencing 
the following toxicities if attributed to veliparib/placebo:
Hematological toxicities:
●Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia persisting ≥  7 days
●Grade 3 or 4 ANC with fever (ANC < 1.0 × 109/L, fever ≥ 38.5°C)
●Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia
Non-hematological toxicities
●Any CTCAE ≥ Grade 3 toxicity that represents at least 2 grade increase from 
baseline with the following clarifications
○Excludes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and tumor pain that have not received 
optimal treatment with antiemetics, antidiarrheals, or analgesics.
○A rise in creatinine to Grade 3, only if not corrected to Grade 1 or baseline within 24 hours with IV fluids.
○Metabolic toxicities, only if not corrected to Grade 2 or less within 
24hours (such as glucose changes, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, 
hyperuricemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyponatremia).  Grade 4 metabolic toxicities that are symptomatic will result in dose reduction regardless of 
duration or ability to correct.
○For any > Grade 2 event of seizure attributed to veliparib/placebo, 
veliparib/placebo is to be interrupted, brain CT or MRI obtained, and the 
event should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD.
Re-escalation may be permitted on the veliparib monotherapy arm only if toxicity 
resolved to Grade 1 or lower and can be maintained with optimal supportive care.  This should be discussed with the appropriate AbbVie TA MD.

Carboplatin:
Severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring 
bronchodilators, angioedema, or generalized urticaria, require immediate discontinuation of carboplatin and aggressive symptomatic therapy.  Subjects who have developed hypersensitivity reactions may undergo desensitization per institutional protocol as determined by the investigator.  This should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD.

6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (ifknown) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study treatment, and any action(s) taken.  For serious and nonserious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility"of being associated with study treatment, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events

intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8regarding toxicity 
management)] and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure will not be considered an adverse event if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry or is due to an improvement in the underlying disease.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie, as
appropriate, as a serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator,would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility, hospitalization for respite care, or 
hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
113
Persistent or 
Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g.,sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  A toxicity is deemed "clinically 
significant"on the basis of the investigator's medical judgment.  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The study Investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria forAdverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0).
36
For adverse events not captured by the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0, the Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event:
Mild (Grade 1) The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
114
Moderate 
(Grade 2)The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities.
Severe (Grade 3 or 4)The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
Death (Grade 5) The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe).
If a reported adverse event increasesin severity, the initial adverse event should be given 
an outcome date and a new adverse event should be reported to reflect the change in 
severity.
For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, the supplemental CRFs 
also need to be updated and need to include the new AE serial number.
6.1.2.1 Adverse Events Expected Due to Breast Cancer or 
Progression of Breast Cancer
Adverse events that may be expected from primary breast cancers or progression of breast 
cancer include skin erythema, skin edema, skin erosion, non-cardiac chest pain, metastases to bone, metastases to brain, metastases to central nervous system, metastases to liver, and tumor pain.
These events may occur alone or in various combinations and are considered expected 
adverse events in breast cancer subjects.
6.1.3 Adverse Events Expected Due to Study Related Endpoints
6.1.3.1 Deaths
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the protocol 
specified adverse event collection period (Section 6.1.5) that are more likely related to 
disease progression will therefore be an expected adverse event and will not be an expedited report.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
115
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death"should only be used for the occurrenceof an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre-existing heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seenalive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death"should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after aut opsy), "unexp lained death"should be replaced 
by the established cause of death.
6.1.3.2 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Disease
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease are also considered an expected outcome for this studyand will not be subject to expedited reporting.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event.
6.1.4 Relationship to Study Drug
The Investigator will use the following definitions toassess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study treatment:  For the purpose of this section, study treatment is considered veliparib or placebo, carboplatin and or paclitaxel.
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study treatment will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
116
associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported causality or deemed it not 
assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study treatment 
is given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious adverse event.
6.1.5 Adverse Event Collection Period
All protocol-related serious and nonserious adverse events must be collected from the 
signing of the study specific informed consentuntil study treatment administration. 
In addition, all adverse events reported from the time of study treatment administration 
until 30 days following discontinuation of study treatment administration have elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.   
Serious and nonserious adverse events occurring after the study-specific informed consent 
is signed but prior to the initial dose of veliparib/placebo, carboplatin or paclitaxel will be collected onlyif they are considered by the Investigator to be causally related to study 
required procedures.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure2.

Figure 2. Adverse Event Collection
* Only if considered by the Investigator to be causally related to study-required procedures.
** Adverse events of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia or any second primary malignancy should 
be reported throughout the entire duration of follow-up phase even if the onset is > 30 days following 
discontinuation of study treatment.
6.1.6 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether related to AbbViestudy medication or 
not, the Investigator will notify AbbVie Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by entering the serious adverse event data into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system, or if RAVEis not operable, 
should be faxed to AbbVie Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of being made aware of the serious adverse event.
FAX to:  +1 (847)-938-0660 or
Email to:  PPDINDPharmacovigilance@abbvie.com

COVID-19 infections should be captured as adverse events.  If the eventmeets the criteria 
for a serious adverse event (SAE), then follow the SAE reporting directions per the protocol and above.  If a subject has a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, the investigator should contact the AbbVie TA MD before reintroducingstudy drug.
6.1.7 Pregnancy
As there is a potential risk of birth or early development defects with study treatment(s), 
subjects will consent to avoid pregnancy and/or breastfeeding for a minimum of 6 months (or longer per local labels of carboplatin and paclitaxel, if applicable) following completion of therapy.  Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 24hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1).  Information regarding a pregnancy 
occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected within the EDC system.  Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
Male subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken by their 
female partners.  If the subject's partner should become pregnant during the study, this should also be reported and data may be collected.  In the event of pregnancy occurring in the partner of an enrolled subject, written informed consent for release of medical information from the partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy-specific information and the pregnancy willbe followed to outcome.
6.1.8 Toxicity Management
For the purpose of medical management, all adverse events and laboratory abnormalities 
that occur during the study must be evaluated by the Investigator.  The table of clinical toxicity grades modified from the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 Published:  May 28, 2009 (v4.03:  June 14, 2010) (available on the CTEP home page http://ctep.info.nih.gov) is to 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
120
be used in the grading of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities that are reported as 
adverse events, each of whichwill be followed to satisfactory clinical resolution.
A drug-related toxicity is an adverse event or laboratory value outside of the reference 
range that is judged by the Investigator or AbbVie as a "reasonable possibility"to be related to the study treatment (Section 6.1.1.1).
A toxicity is deemed "clinically significant"on the basis of the investigator's medical judgment.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any Complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the 
product.
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), missing components/product, or packaging issues.
6.2.2 Reporting
Product Complaints concerning the investigational product must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event via the Product Complaint form.  Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a satisfactory conclusion.  All follow-up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the Sponsor.  Product Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
121
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition.  In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days.  Ifreturns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to 
investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol eligibility criteria.  The principal investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified) after a subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notifying Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) regulatory authorities (as applicable), and his or her assigned clinical monitor or the following AbbVie representatives:
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
123
the impact of any discrepancies between results from the local laboratory and from the 
Sponsor core laboratory.
All subjects who receive at least one dose of the study treatment (veliparib or placebo) 
will be included in the safety analysis.  
Comparisons will be performed between the two treatments as assigned by the IVRS/IWR 
(veliparib120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel versus placebo BID + carboplatin +paclitaxel).
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
8.1.1 Baseline Characteristics
All baseline summary statistics and analyses will be based on characteristics prior to the 
initiation of study treatment (or randomization for non-treated subjects).  Unless otherwise stated, baseline for a given variable will be defined as the last value for that variable obtained prior to the first dose of study treatment.
Baseline characteristic data will be summarized for all subjects who are randomized to 
veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel.
8.1.1.1 Demographics
Continuous demographic data (e.g., age, height, and weight) will be summarized with 
means, standard deviation, and range.  Frequencies and percentages will be computed for the following parameters:  gender, race, BRCA1, BRCA2, ER/PgR status, number and 
sites of metastases, prior platinum therapy (yes versus no), CNS metastases (yes versus no), and baseline ECOG performance status.
8.1.1.2 Medical Histories
Frequencies and percentages will be computed for each medical history parameter.

124
8.1.2 Efficacy Endpoints
8.1.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary efficacy analysis will be a comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) 
between veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo BID + carboplatin 
+paclitaxel.
For a given subject, time to PFS will be defined as the number of days from the date the 
subject was randomized to the date the subject experiences disease progression (as determined by the investigators), or death, whichever occurs first (all causes of mortality).  All events of disease progression will be included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the subject was still taking study treatment or had previously discontinued study treatment.  Events of death will be included for subjects who had not experienced an event of disease progression, provided the death occurred within 9 weeks of the last evaluable disease progression assessment.  If the subject does not have an event of disease progression and the subject has not died as defined above, the subject's data will be censored at the date of the subject's last evaluable disease progression assessment.  Every effort should be made to document radiographic progression for analysis of the primary endpoint, even after discontinuation of treatment or initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.
8.1.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Secondary efficacy analyses comparing the effects of veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin 
+ paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel on the following set of endpoints will be performed:  overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR) through the end of Week24, objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival on subsequent therapy (PFS2).
Time to death (overall survival) for a given subject will be defined as the number of days 
from the date the subject was randomized to the date of the subject's death.  All events of death will be included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the subject was still 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
125
taking study treatment or after the subject discontinued study treatment. If a subject has 
not died, the data will be censored at the date last known to be alive.
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the progression-free rate at 24 weeks from the 
Kaplan-Meier curve for time to progression (defined as from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression as determined by the investigators).
Objective Response Rate (ORR) is calculated as the proportion of subjects who have PR 
or CR based on assessment by the investigators.  All subjects who have had at least onemeasurable lesion at baseline will be included in the ORR calculation.
Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2) will be defined as the number of days from the day 
the subject is randomized to the date that the subject has disease progression or death of any cause on the subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first.  If the subject does not have an event of PFS2 (as determined by the Investigator), the subject's data will be censored at the subject's last known date of follow-up.
8.1.2.3 Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints
In addition to the primary and secondary efficacy analyses, tertiary efficacy analyses will 
be performed comparing the effects of veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel versus placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel onduration of response (DOR), quality of life, and performance status.
Duration of response will be defined as the number of days from the day that the criteria 
are met for CR or PR, whichever is recorded first, to the date that progressive disease is documented.  If a subject's response is ongoing at the analysis cutoff date then the subjects data will be censored at the date of the last disease progression assessment performed prior to the cutoff.  Subjects who never experience a confirmed PR or CR will not be included in the analysis.

EudraCT 2014-000345-70
126
8.1.3 Timing of Efficacy Analyses and Safety Evaluations
When the 344thPFS (determined by the investigators) event occurs, there will be a final 
review of the eCRF data.  When the data are reviewed for completeness and all data 
management quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) procedures are performed, the randomization schedule will be released and clinical database data will be extracted for documentation and statistical analyses of the efficacy and safety data.
The data cutoff date for the primary PFS analyses will be specified in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) prior to database lock.  All imaging related efficacy analyses (PFS, CBR, ORR, DOR) will include data up to the cutoff date.
OS will be analyzed at the time of 'Primary PFS Analysis'as an interim analysis.  The Lan 
DeMets alpha spending function with an O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be used to ensure that the one-sided false positive rate will be 0.025 or less for overall survival.  If OS is not statistically significant at the interim analysis, a 'Final OS Analysis'will be performed after observing approximately 357 death events.  Additional OS analyses may be performed before the 'Final OS analysis,'if requested by regulatory agencies or otherwise warranted.  For each additional interim analysis of OS, a small amount of alpha (0.00001) will be spent.
Theclinical study report (CSR) will summarize the results from the above analyses.
8.1.4 Primary Analysis of Efficacy
The distribution of PFS (PFS as determined by the investigators, as detailed in 
Section5.3.3) will be estimated for each treatment group using Kaplan-Meier 
methodology and compared between veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment groupsusing the log-rank test, stratified by ER and/or PgR positive versus ER/PgR negative and prior platinum therapy (yes versus no).
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
127
8.1.5 Secondary Analyses of Efficacy
If the veliparib treatment group is not statistically significantly better than the placebo 
treatment group for the primary endpoint of PFS, then none of the secondary endpoints will be tested and statistical significance will not be declared for any secondary endpoints regardless of the observed P values.  Pvalues for secondary efficacy analyses will be 
subject to multiple comparison adjustments using the fixed sequence testing method, with analyses performed in the following order:  OS, CBR, ORR, and PFS2.
8.1.5.1 Overall Survival
The distribution of overall survival will be estimated for each treatment group using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology and compared between veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin +paclitaxel and placebo  + carboplatin + paclitaxel using the log-rank test, stratified by ER and/or PgR positive versus ER/PgR negative and prior platinum therapy(yes versus no).
8.1.5.2 Clinical Benefit Rate
Clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, SD or Non-CR/Non-PD) at Week 24 will be defined as the 
progression-free rate at 24 weeks from the Kaplan-Meier curve for time to progression (defined as from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression as determined by investigators).  A test statistic based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of the progression-free probability at 24 weeks and the estimated variance will be constructed to test the null hypothesis that the clinical benefit rate at Week 24 for the twotreatment groups are the same.
8.1.5.3 Objective Response Rate
The objective response rate (CR and PR) will be computed for all subjects with 
measurable disease at baseline.  The proportion of subjects with a complete or partial objective response based on the RECIST (version 1.1) criteria in Section 5.3.3will be 
estimated for each treatment group and compared between veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel using CMH test, 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
128
stratified by ER/PgR positive versus ER/PgR negative and prior platinum therapy (yes 
versus no).
8.1.5.4 PFS2
The distribution of PFS2 will be estimated for each treatment group using Kaplan-Meier 
methodology and compared between veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment groups using the log-rank test, stratified by ER and/or PgR positive versus ER/PgR negative and prior platinum therapy (yes versus no).
8.1.6 Tertiary Analyses of Efficacy
8.1.6.1 Duration of Overall Response
The distribution of the duration of overall response for responders (CR or PR) will be 
estimated for each treatment group using Kaplan-Meier methodology.
8.1.6.2 Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
The EORTC scoring manual will be used to transform the raw scores into the domain 
scores (global heath, functional scales, symptom scales/items).  The EQ-5D manual and the published weights will be used to convert the individual items to the utility scores.  The BPI-SF user guide will be used to convert the raw responses to pain severity and pain interference scores.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the individual item and scored 
domain/sub-scale QoL and pain scores at each scheduled assessment time point.  Change from baseline in the domain scores at the time of each assessment will be summarized.  Subjects with a baseline score and at least one post baseline score during the treatment period will be included in the change from baseline analyses.
The PRO variables will include the global health status/QoL and the functional and 
symptom domain scores from the EORTC questionnaires, the utility score from EQ-5-D 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
129
questionnaire, and the pain severity and pain interference scores from the BPI-SF 
questionnaires.  
Analyses of the above PRO variables and the corresponding endpoints will be specified in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to answer the following primary questions:
●Is there a statistically significant difference between treatment arms in the 
longitudinal changes in overall quality of life and specific symptoms from 
baseline to pre-specified time points (details will be specified in SAP);
●Are the longitudinal changes meaningful?
Change from baseline to post-baseline assessment visit between two treatment arms will 
be compared using ANCOVA model with treatment and corresponding baseline value as covariates.  Additional statistical analyses may be performed if deemed necessary and helpful in understanding the drug effect, such as an analysis of repeated measure may be used to compare overall change from baseline between two treatment groups by including baseline value, treatment, and time of visit as covariates.  Clinical meaningful changes frombaseline to assessment points will be based on minimum important difference (MID) derived from the data using published distribution and anchor based methods.
40  Time to 
the firstdeterioration in overall QoL may also be assessed using survival analysis based on pre-specified MID for deterioration based on published information.
8.1.6.3 Performance Status
Analyses of changes from baseline will be performed for each scheduled post-baseline 
visit for ECOG performance status using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as the factor and baseline value as a covariate.  Subjects that do not have a baseline measurement or do not have any post-baseline measurements will not be included.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
130
8.1.7 Additional Efficacy Analyses
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using all randomized 
subjects'data, regardless whether or not the subject has suspected deleterious or deleterious mutation confirmed by the Sponsor core lab.
In addition to the stratified log-rank test for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, 
the unstratified log-rank test, Wilcoxon test, and the Cox proportionalhazards model may be used for the comparison of PFS and overall survival between veliparib 120 mg BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel.
PFS, ORR, CBR, and duration of overall response based on radiological and clinical 
assessment by the central imaging center will also be analyzed using the same statistical methodology as that for the corresponding primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.
For those subjects who take other anti-cancer therapies after discontinuation of the study 
treatment, the primary efficacy and secondary efficacy endpoints of PFS, and overall survival will be censored at the date of subject's initiation of other anti-cancer therapies.  These modified primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the same methodology as detailed in previous sections.
For PFS and OS, additional analyses may also be performed, such as 1) including only 
data and events occurring on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment, 2)using a Cox proportional hazard model to explore the effect of baseline factors including (but not limited to) the following:  ER/PgR status, BRCA1/2 status, prior 
platinum therapy (yes versus no), ECOG performance status, stage of the disease, and others, 3)subgroup analysis by ER/PgR status, BRCA1/2 status, prior platinum therapy 
(yes versus no), CNS metastases (yes versus no), ECOG performance status, stage of the disease, and others, 4) stratified log-rank test by region (US versus non-US), and ECOG performance status (0 to 1 versus 2), and 5) using interval censoring methods to analyze PFS.

131
Alternative statistical analyses may be performed if deemed necessary and helpful in 
understanding the drug effect.
8.1.8 Interim Analysis
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) reviewed the unblinded safety data 
for this veliparib Phase 3 study (including all subjects enrolled in the study) when approximately 60 subjects met at least one of the following criteria:
●Received 6 cycles of treatment
●Reached an event of disease progression
●Discontinued the study due to toxicity/adverse events
BRCA status discordances between Sponsor core laboratory and local labs were assessed internally at the time of the interim analysis.  Subsequent IDMC reviews of unblinded safety data priorto the primary analysis were carried out based on IDMC recommendations. No additional reviews by the IDMC will occur since the Sponsor management team was unblinded after completing the primary analysis.
An alpha of 0.0001 (the Haybittle-Peto stopping boundary) will be allocated for PFS at 
the interim analysis, although there is no intention to stop the study early for efficacy.  The final PFS analysis will be tested at one-sided alpha of 0.025.  With this stopping boundary, the overall Type 1 error rate is controlled at 0.025 or less.
8.1.9 Safety Assessments
The safety of veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel 
will be assessed by evaluating study treatment exposure, adverse events, serious adverse events, and all deaths, aswell as changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign parameters.  Subjects who were randomized but did not receive study treatment (veliparib or placebo) will not be included in the analyses of safety.

8.1.10 Statistical Analyses of Safety
8.1.10.1 Duration of Study Treatment
A summary of the number of days and/or cycles subjects were exposed to study treatment 
will be provided.
8.1.10.2 Adverse Events
Analyses of adverse events will include only "treatment-emergent"events, i.e., those that 
have an onset on or after the day of the first dose of study drug (veliparib or placebo).  Analyses will not include those that have an onset greater than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be coded and summarized by system organ class 
and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)
37adverse event coding dictionary.  The percentage of subjects experiencing 
an adverse event at a given severity, NCI CTCAE version 4.0 grade, and relationship to study treatment will be provided.  Comparisons of the percentages of subjects experiencing an adverse event between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel will be performed using Fisher's exact test.
8.1.10.3 Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse events will be summarized using the same methods as adverse events 
described above in Section 8.1.10.2.
8.1.10.4 Deaths
The number of subjectdeaths will be summarized 1) for deaths occurring while the 
subject was still receiving study treatment in this study, 2) for deaths occurring off treatment within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, and 3) for all deaths in this study regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study treatment.

8.1.10.5 Longitudinal Analyses of Laboratory and Vital Signs Data
Changes from baseline will be analyzed for each scheduled post-baseline visit and for the 
final visit for blood chemistry and hematology parameters, as well as urinalysis and vital sign parameters.  If more than one measurement exists for a subject on a particular day, an arithmetic average will be calculated.  This average will be considered to be that subject's measurement for that day.  Post-baseline measurements more than 30 days after the last dose of randomized study treatment will not be included.  Subjects that do not have a baseline measurement or do not have any post-baseline measurements will not be included.  Comparisons of the differences in mean changes from baseline between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo BID + carboplatin + paclitaxel will be made using ANOVA with treatment group as the factor.
8.1.10.6 Analyses of Laboratory Data Using NCI CTCAE
Where applicable, blood chemistry and hematology determinations will be categorized 
according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 grades, and shifts from baseline NCI CTCAE version 4.0 grades to maximum and final post-baseline grades will be assessed.  The baseline and final grades will be defined respectively as the grade of the last measurement collected prior to the first dose of study treatment, and as the grade of the last post-baseline measurement collected no more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.  If multiplevalues are available for a post baseline measurement, then the value with the highest NCI CTCAE grade will be used in the assessment of shift.  Comparisons of the number of subjects experiencing a shift from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to maximum postbaseline grades of 3 to 4, and from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to final postbaseline grades of 3 to 4 between veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel and placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel will be performed using Fisher's exact tests.
Detailed listings of data for subjects experiencing NCI CTCAE Grade 3 to 4 blood 
chemistry and hematology values will be provided.  All measurements collected, regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study treatment, will be included in these listings.

8.1.10.7 Analyses of Vital Signs Using Criteria for Potentially 
Clinically Significant Vital Sign Values
Detailed listings of data for subjects experiencing potentially clinically significant vital 
sign values according to the AbbVie-defined criteria for vital sign values will be provided.  All measurements collected, regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study treatment, will be included in these listings.
8.1.10.8 Multiplicity Adjustments
If the veliparib treatment group demonstrates statistically significantly better PFS than the 
placebo group, then the secondary endpoints will be tested using the fixed sequence testing procedure with the following testing order:  OS, CBR, ORR, and PFS2.
A multiplicity issue is introduced through the multiple testing of the OS endpoint.  It is 
anticipated that, at the analysis time of the primary efficacy endpoint PFS, there will be too few death events to support an adequately powered OS analysis.  Therefore, two OS analyses are planned, the first one based on the "Primary PFS Analysis"database, and the second one based on the "OS Analysis"database with a total of 357 death events.  Statistical significance for OS will be declared if a significant result is obtained for either analysis, consistent with group sequential testing methods.
The Lan DeMets alpha spending function with an O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be used 
to ensure that the one-sided false positive rate will be 0.025 or less for overall survival.  The exact αlevel to be used at the first OS analysis will be dependent on the information 
fraction for OS at the time of the 'Primary PFS Analysis'.  This approach is being taken so that the majority of the α-level will be withheld until a total of 357 death events have 
occurred.
8.1.10.9 Censoring Dates for Subjects that had the Prematurely 
Blind Broken
For progression free survival analysis, if the subjects does not experience an event of 
disease progression or death (as defined above for PFS endpoint) on or before the date of 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
135
blind break, the subject's data will be censored at the date ofthe subject's last available 
disease progression assessment on or before the blind break.
For duration of overall response and clinical benefit rate through the end of Week 24 
(CBR) analyses, if the subject does not experience an event of disease progression on or before the date of blind break, the subject's data will be censored at the date of the subject's last available disease progression assessment on or before the blind break.
For objective response rate (ORR) analysis, disease progression assessment data after the 
blind break date will not be included.
A blind break performed by AbbVie pharmacovigilance will not be considered a 
premature blind break.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Assuming the true hazard ratio in favor of the veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel 
treatment group is 0.69 for PFS, a total of 344 PFS events will be needed for the study to have at least 90% power at 2-sided α level of 0.05 to detect a statistically significant 
treatment effect for the veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment group using the log-rank test for PFS.  Assuming the median PFS of 12 months in the placebo arm, a hazard ratio of 0.69 would correspond approximately to an increase in median PFS of 5.5months under the exponential model assumption. 
In addition,assuming the true hazard ratio in favor of the veliparib 120 mg BID + 
carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment group is 0.714 for OS, a total of 357 death events will be needed for the study to have at least 85% power at 2-sided α level of 0.05 to detect a 
statistically significant treatment effect for the veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment group using the log-rank test for OS.
A total of approximately 500 subjects with a BRCA mutation as documented by the 
Sponsor core laboratory will be enrolled into the study to accrue the anticipated 344 PFS 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
136
events and 357 death events.  The required number of PFS events has been increased to 
ensure 90% power if true HR is 0.69.  
8.3 Randomization Methods
IVRS/IWRS will be utilized to randomize subjects.  Before the study is initiated 
directions for the IVRS/IWRS will be provided to each site.  The investigational site will contact the IVRS/IWRS on or within 2 days prior to the subject's Study Day 1 (C1D-2).  The randomization numbers will assign subjects in 2:1 ratio to either veliparib + carboplatin + paclitaxel, or placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel.  Subject randomization will be stratified by ER and/or PgR positive versus ER/PgR negative, prior platinum therapy (yes versus no), and CNS metastases (yes versus no).
One set of subject randomization schedule will be generated by the Clinical Statistics 
Department at AbbVie prior to the start of the study.  A copy of all randomization schedules will be kept by the Clinical Statistics Department at AbbVie and a copy will be forwarded to the IVRS/IWRS vendor.
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consentand all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation 
of any changes made to the study design.  The Investigator will be required to submit, 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
137
maintain and archive study essential documents according to International Conferences on 
Harmonization (ICH) GCP.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local 
regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the Investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH guidelines, applicable 
regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical Investigator are specified in AppendixA.
In the event thatthe COVID-19 pandemic leadsto difficulties in performing protocol-specified procedures, AbbVie will engage with study site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the study while trying to best manage subject continuity of care.  This may include alternative methods for assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use of a local lab instead of a central lab), and shipping investigational product and/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity of treatment where allowed.  In all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by local regulations and permitted by IRB/IEC.  Investigators should notify AbbVie if any urgent safety measures are taken to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard.
9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related 
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
138
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed, signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informedconsent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the study, stored biomarker 
and exploratory research samples will continue to be used for research and analysis.  In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request that their samples be withdrawn.  Once AbbVie receives the request, remaining biomarker and exploratory research samples will be destroyed.  If the subject changes his/her consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data.
An informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, must be voluntarily signed and dated 
before samples are collected for optional exploratory research.  The nature of the testing should be explained and the subject given an opportunity to ask questions.  The informed consent must be signed before the samples are collected and any testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to provide samples for the optional exploratory research, it will not impact their participation in the study.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, modifications to the protocol may be necessary.  
Subjects should be informed of the changes to the conduct of the study relevant to their participation (e.g., cancellation of visits, change in laboratory testing site, drug delivery method, etc.).  Documentation of this notification and verbal consent should be maintained at the site.  A signed and dated informed consent form should be obtained from the subject afterwards as soon as possible, if required by local regulations.

10.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records.  This may include 
hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects'diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x-rays.  Data collected during this study must be recorded on the appropriate source documents.
The QoL questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23, EQ-5D-5L) will be completed by the 
subject onworksheets and will be considered source data.
The Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this 
study.  These forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to AbbVie and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called Rave
®provided by the 
technology vendor Medidata Solutions Incorporated, NY, USA.  The EDC system and the study-specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply with Title 21 CFR Part11.  The documentation related to the validation of the EDC system is available through the vendor, Medidata, while the validation of the study-specific eCRFs will be conducted by AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The Investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will be recorded by investigative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation.
Veliparib
M12-914 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-000345-70
140
The Investigator or an authorized member of the Investigator's staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by AbbVie personnel (or their representatives).  AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries.  The Investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide his or her electronicsignature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.
Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a 
password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from Investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the Investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for the Investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
11.0 Data Quality Assurance
Prior to enrolling any subject in the study, a Site Initiation Visit will be held with AbbVie personnel ( and/ortheir representatives), the Investigators, and the appropriate site 
personnel.  This meeting will include a detailed discussion and review of the protocol and essential documents, performance of study procedures, eCRF completion, and specimen collection methods.  The personnel at the study site will be trained on the study procedures, when applicable, by an AbbVie monitor or designee.
The AbbVie monitor or designee will monitor the study site throughout the study.  A 
source document review will be performed against entries on the eCRFs and a quality assurance check will be performed to ensure that the Investigator is complying with the protocol and regulations.  In addition, ongoing review of the data will be conducted by a physician or representative at AbbVie.

EudraCT 2014-000345-70
141
Data entered into eCRFs will be electronically transferred to AbbVie and importedinto 
the database using validated software throughout the study.  Computer logic checks will be run to identify such items as inconsistent study dates.  Any necessary corrections will be made to the eCRF.
If applicable, data hand-entered directly in the database from paper CRFs or reports will 
be verified by a double-key entry procedure at AbbVie.  Any discrepancies will be reviewed against the hard-copy CRF and corrected on-line.  After completion of the entry process, computer logic checks will be run toidentify such items as inconsistent study dates.  Any necessary corrections will be made to the database in the same manner via the appropriate change form.
Routine hematology, serum chemistry and serology, and urinalysis will be conducted 
using a centrallaboratory.  The data from these analyses will be electronically transferred from the central laboratory to the study database.
A review of all laboratory results will be conducted by a physician and clinical review 
team at AbbVie, the AbbVie monitors (ortheir representatives), the Investigator, and other appropriate personnel from AbbVie.
12.0 Use of Information
Any research that may be done using optional exploratory research samples from this study will be experimental in nature and the results will not be suitable for clinical decision-making or subject management.  Hence, the subject will not be informed of individual results, should analyses be performed, nor will anyone not directly involved in this research.  Correspondingly, researchers will have no access to subject identifiers.  Individual results will not be reported to anyone not directly involved in this research other than for regulatory purposes.  Data from optional exploratory research may be provided to investigators and used in scientific publications or presented at medical conventions.  Optional exploratory research information will be published or presented only in a way that does not identify any individual subject.

a. If a subject discontinues paclitaxel on Day 8 and/or Day 15, the study visit and assessments for that specific day can be omi tted.
b. Must be performed prior to the initiation of any screening or study-specific procedures.
c. Height will be recorded at Screening Visit only.
d. Physical exam not required, if performed within 7 days prior to C1D-2, unless clinically indicated.e. ECG must be obtained one hour after dosing with veliparib/placebo and prior to the paclitaxel or carboplatin infusions.
f. Pregnancy tests must be completed and confirmed as not indicative of pregnancy prior to randomization (within 24 hours) and m ay be repeated during the study according 
country requirements.
g. Refer to Table4for detailed list of tests to be performed and frequency.
h. For Day 1 visits, study samples for central laboratory analysis may be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing. For Day 8 a nd Day 15 visits, study samples for central 
laboratory analysis may be performed within 24 hours of the scheduled day.  There is no visit window for C1D-2 as any sample pr ior to randomization is still considered to be 
screening.  A qualified (e.g., certification or accreditation) local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory analyses for treatment decisions but this cannot replace the 
central laboratory analysis on a protocol defined visit, unless AbbVie removes the requirements for sites to send clinical labo ratory samples to the central laboratory or under 
special situations (i.e.,pandemic) that are approved by the Sponsor and allowed as per local regulation.
i. For Screening labs performed greater than 7 days prior to C1D-2, hematology/chemistry should be split (and sent to central la b) at C1D-2 and local labs reviewed prior to 
dosing.
j. For subjects on prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin, INR should be monitored before each treatment.  Tr eatment should be held for INR of > 1.5 × ULN 
on prophylactic warfarin or > therapeutic range if on full dose warfarin.

a. When a subject discontinues the blinded or unblinded study treatment, a Final Visit will be conducted.
b. All subjects will have one Follow-up Visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  This Follow-up 
Visit does not need to be performed for subjects who have had a Final Visit conducted ≥ 30 days after the last dose 
of study drug or for subjects who are entering unblinded veliparib monotherapy treatment.  Follow-up visits should 
not precede a Final Visit.
c. If a subject meets criteria for discontinuation of therapy,survival and post treatment therapy will be collected every 
two months (unless requested by sponsor more frequently to support data analysis) beginning on the date the subject discontinues therapy.  All randomized subjects should be followed for disease progression (PFS) and for the secondprogression (PFS2), until the endpoint of death (OS), until the subject has become lost to follow-up, or until study termination by AbbVie.
d. Refer to Table4for detailed list of tests to be performed and frequency.  Laboratory assessments, physical 
examinations and vital signs will only be completed for AE follow-up or reported SAEs after the 30-day follow-up visitper Section 6.1.5.
e. Tumor assessments to support evidence of PD for PFS endpoint wereconducted every 9 weeks until PD, death or 
withdrawal of consent for follow-up until PD. Following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, the tumor assessment interval may be increased to every 12 weeks (tumor assessments may beconducted ±10 businessdays following the scheduled assessment from last scan). Atthe investigator's discretion, the interval between scans maybe longer thanevery 12w eeks for subjects who have durable disease control, but

a. For subjects who have been receiving single-agent veliparib/placebo at a stable dosewithout adjustments for 
multiple cycles and who have no ongoing study drug related uncontrolled AEs, it is possible to alternate on-site 
visits and phone visits by the investigator or designee every other cycle.  Ata minimum, subjects should have an on-site visit every other cycle. If an on-site visit is not  possible for 2 consecutive cycles,or if the subjectis not on 
a stable dose or hasongoing study drug related uncontrolled AEsbut wishes to alternate on-site and phone visits, the plan for the subject's visits should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD (see Section 7.0for contact 
information).
b. During the on-site visitstheInvestigator or designeewillprovide the PRO Questionnaires(QLQ C30, BR23, EQ 
5D 5L and BPI-SF) for the next cycle to the subject, so these can be completed at home.
c. QLQ C30, BR23, EQ 5D 5L questionnaires will be administered every other cycle prior to dosing beginning with 
Cycle 2 (C2, C4, C6, etc.).  If questionnaires were completed during an on-site visit, they may not be required at the subsequent phone visit.
d. In addition to assessing AEsand Concomitant Therapies, the investigator or designee should assess treatment 
compliance and to the extent possible, assess for any clinical evidence of disease progression.  If there are concerns about new or worsening AEs or if there is suspicion of disease progression, an unscheduled on-site visit, local labs,and/or tumor assessment should be scheduled.
e. During the on-site visits,theInvestigator or designeewill dispense medication for 2 cycles via IRT and the double 
amount of Dosing Cards, so subjects can complete them for both cycles.
Note: Phone visit may be performed four (4) business days prior or after the scheduled study visit date.

Appendix L. General Chemotherapy Guidelines
●A patient will be permitted to have a new cycle of chemotherapy delayed up to 
7 days (without this being considered to be a protocol violation) for major life 
events (e.g., serious illness in a family member, major holiday, vacation which 
is unable to be re-scheduled).  Documentation to justify this decision should be provided. 
●It will be acceptable for individual chemotherapy doses to be delivered within a 24-hour window before and after the protocol-defined date for Day 1 treatment.  If the treatment due date is a Friday, and the patient cannot be 
treated on that Friday, then the window for treatment would include the 
Thursday (1 day earlier than due) through the Monday (Day 3 past due). 
●For weekly regimens, it will be acceptable for individual chemotherapy doses 
to be delivered within a "24-hour window"for scheduling conflicts; for 
example:  "Day 8 chemotherapy"can be delivered on Day 7, Day 8, or Day 9 and "Day 15 chemotherapy"can be given on Day 14, Day 15, or Day 16.
●Chemotherapy doses can be "rounded"according to institutional standards without being considered a protocol violation (most institutions use a rule of approximately ± 5% of the calculated dose).
●Chemotherapy doses are required to be recalculated if the patient has a weight change of greater than or equal to 10%.  Subjectsare permitted to have chemotherapy doses recalculated for < 10% weight changes.

Protocol Title:  A Phase 3 Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or 
Without the PARP Inhibitor Veliparib (ABT-888) in HER2-Negative Metastatic or Locally Advanced Unresectable BRCA -Associated Breast Cancer
Objectives:  The primary endpoint is to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of veliparib in 
combination with carboplatin (C) and paclitaxel (P) compared to placebo with C/P in subjects with a BRCA1and/or BRCA2 Mutation and HER2-Negative Metastatic or Locally Advanced Unresectable 
Breast Cancer.
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), 
objective response rate (ORR), PFS2 and duration of overall response (DOR) in subjects treated with veliparib in combination with C/P versus subjects treated with placebo with C/P.  The tertiary objectives are to assess change in ECOG performance status, change in Quality of Life (QoL).
Study Sites:  Multicenter; Approximately 200
Study Population:   Men and women ≥ 18 years of age with HER2-negative metastatic or locally 
advanced unresectable breast cancer and clinically significant (suspected deleterious or deleterious) BRCA1and/or BRCA2 germline mutation.  Patients with bone-only disease and/or hormone receptor 
positive (ER and/or PR) disease should be deemed appropriate candidates for combination chemotherapy.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of veliparib 
in combination with C/P compared to placebo plus C/P in subjects with BRCA1or BRCA2germline 
mutation and with HER2-negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer who have received no more than 2 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease.
Veliparib/placebo will be dosed in combination with carboplatin AUC 6 with weekly paclitaxel 
(80mg/m
2), on a 21-day cycle.  Subject randomization will be in a 2:1 ratio to veliparib/C/P or 
placebo/C/P and stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive versus ER/PgR negative, prior platinum therapy (yes versus no), and CNS metastases (yes versus no).
Subjectswith BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation per local lab testing and who meet the remaining eligibility 
criteria may be randomized.  Patients who meet NCCN guidelines for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing are eligible 
for testing during the screening period.  BRCAmutation status will be documented for all patients by the 
central laboratory (Myriad).
Subjects who discontinue carboplatin and paclitaxel and who have not progressed will continue 
veliparib/placebo as a single agent at the recommended Phase 2 single agent dose.  Subjects will continue dosing until they meet the defined treatment discontinuation criteria.  Subjects who discontinue carboplatin, paclitaxel, and veliparib/placebo for reasons other than progression should remain on study.  At the time PD is documented according toRECIST 1.1, subjects randomized to placebo may be eligible to crossover to unblinded veliparib monotherapy.

Methodology (Continued):
Tumor assessments (CT scan or MRI of the full chest, abdomen, pelvis and brain MRI or contrast CT) 
will be performed at screening and then every 9 weeks from C1D-2 until tumor progressionto determine 
the extent of tumor burden per RECIST 1.1 (post-baseline brain MRI or contrast CT is only required in subjects with CNS lesions at baseline; in all other subjects, CNS imaging will be obtained as clinically indicated based upon symptoms indicative of CNS disease).  In addition to being reviewed by the investigator and/or site staff, radiographic scans will be sent to a central imaging center for review.  Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression should remain on study and continue to undergo a modified schedule of assessments until disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  For subjects who meet study discontinuation criteria and who have not progressed (such as patients who initiate another anti-cancer therapy), tumor assessment data per RECIST 1.1 will continue to be collected to documenttumor status and the date of progression.  Post treatment information (including dates and response to subsequent therapies) and survival information will be collected every two months beginning on the date the subject is registered as off study until theendpoint of death, the subject is lost to follow-up or until the study termination by AbbVie.
QoL assessment via the EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires will be collected on 
C1D-2 pre-dose, Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 4 (C6, C8, etc.), Final Visit, and 30-Day Follow-Up Visit.  Subjects who crossover to the unblinded veliparib monotherapy arm will continue to have QoL assessments performed as per this schedule (Day 1 of the first and second cycle of unblinded monotherapy and every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 4 until 2
nddisease progression or until they meet the defined study treatment discontinuation criteria and at 
the Final Visit and 30-Day Follow-Up Visit).  P ain assessment via the BPI-SF will be collected at every 
cycle.

Interim Analyses: To ensure subject safety, an IDMC will review unblinded safety data (which will include all subjects enrolled in the study) when approximately 60 subjects have met at least one of the following criteria:
!Received 6 cycles of treatment
!Reached an event of disease progression
!Discontinued the study due to toxicity/adverse events
Subsequent reviews will be based on recommendations from the IDMC.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Progression-free Survival (PFS):   will be evaluated according to progression per RECIST (version 1.1) 
and survival information (death).  Radiologic tumor response and disease progression will be assessed by CT scan utilizing RECIST (version 1.1).  Assessments will be performed at Screening, at 9-week intervals (from C1D-2) thereafter until disease progression and at each blinded and unblinded study treatment Final Visit, if not performed within the last 4 weeks.
Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Overall Response 
(DOR):  will be evaluated according to progression per RECIST (version 1.1).  Radiologic tumor 
response and disease progression will be assessed by CT scan utilizing RECIST (version 1.1).  Assessments will be performed at Screening, at 9-week intervals (from C1D-2) thereafter, and at each blinded and unblinded study treatment Final Visit, if not performed within the last 4 weeks (a 2-week window for obtaining the final visit scan is acceptable for maintaining at least a 6-week interval between scans as per local guidance and regulations).
Overall Survival (OS):   will be evaluated according to survival information and post treatment 
information (including therapy, dates of therapy and response) collected at two month intervals beginning 
on the date the subject is registered off study and until the endpoint of death, the subject is lost to follow-up or until the study termination by AbbVie.

178
Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
PFS2:  will be evaluated according to survival information and post treatment information (includes 
dates of therapy and response per RECIST 1.1) collected at two month intervals.
Statistical Methods:   Unless otherwise noted, for all statistical analyses, statistical significance will be 
determined by a two-sided Pvalue ≤ 0.05 when rounded.
Sample Size Determination:
Assuming the true hazard ratio for PFS in favor of the veliparib + C/P group is 0.69, a total of 344 PFS 
events will be needed for the study to have 90% power at 2-sided α level of 0.05 to detect a statistically 
significant treatment effect for the veliparib + C/P group using the log-rank test for progression free survival.  A total of approximately 500subjects will be enrolled into the study.
Efficacy (Primary and Secondary Endpoints):
The analysis of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints will include only the subjects who have 
been documented to have suspected deleterious or deleterious mutations by the Sponsor core lab.  The primary and secondary analyses will be based upon the investigator's assessment of response and disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  Sensitivity analyses of PFS, ORR, CBR, and duration of overall response based on radiological and clinical assessment by the Central Imaging Center will be conducted.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS):   will be defined as the number of days from the date the subject is 
randomized to the date the subject experiences disease progression, or to the date of death (all causes of 
mortality) if disease progression is not reached.
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR):   will be defined as the progression-free rate at 24 weeks from the 
Kaplan-Meier curve for time to progression (defined as from the date of randomization to the date of 
disease progression).
Overall Survival (OS):   Time to death for a given subject will be defined as the number of days from the 
day the subject is randomized to the date of the subject's death.  All events of death will be included, 
regardless of whether the event occurs while the subject is still taking study drug, or after the subject discontinues study drug.  If a subject has not died, then the data will be censored at the date when the subject is last known to be alive.
Objective Response Rate (ORR):   (CR and PR) will be defined as the proportion of subjects with a 
complete or partial objective response based on RECIST (version 1.1).  All subjects who have had at 
least one measurable lesion at baseline will be included in the ORR calculation.
PFS2:  will be defined as the number of days from the day the subject is randomized to the date that the 
subject has disease progression or death of any cause on the subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first.Duration of Overall Response (DOR):   will be defined as the number of days from the day the criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whichever is recorded first) to the date that PD is objectively documented.  If a 
subject is still responding then the subject's data will be censored at date of the last available disease progression assessment.  For subjects who never experienced CR or PR, the subject's data will not be included in DOR analysis.
Safety:  Safety will be assessed by evaluating study drug exposure, adverse events, serious adverse 
events, all deaths, as well as changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign parameters.  Subjects who are randomized but do not receive study drug (veliparib or placebo) will not be included in the analyses of safety.  Safety analysis results will be presented by treatment group.

AbbVie Protocol Number:   M12-914
Name of Study Drug:   Veliparib (ABT-888) Phase of Development:   Phase 3
Name of Active Ingredient:   Not applicable Date of Protocol Synopsis:   23July 2020
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3 Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or 
Without the PARP Inhibitor Veliparib (ABT-888) in HER2-Negative Metastatic or Locally Advanced Unresectable BRCA -Associated Breast Cancer
Objectives:  The primary endpoint is to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of veliparib in 
combination with carboplatin (C) and paclitaxel (P) compared to placebo with C/P in subjects with a BRCA1and/or BRCA2 Mutation and HER2-Negative Metastatic or Locally Advanced Unresectable 
Breast Cancer.
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), 
objective response rate (ORR), and PFS2 in subjects treated with veliparib in combination with C/P versus subjects treated with placebo with C/P.  The tertiary objectives are to assess duration of overall response (DOR), change in ECOG performance status, and change in Quality of Life (QoL).
Study Sites:  Multicenter; Approximately 200
Study Population:   Men and women ≥ 18 years of age with HER2-negative metastatic or locally 
advanced unresectable breast cancer and clinically significant (suspected deleterious or deleterious) BRCA1and/or BRCA2 germline mutation.  Patients with bone-only disease and/or hormone receptor 
positive (ER and/or PR) disease should be deemed appropriate candidates for combination chemotherapy.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of veliparib 
in combination with C/P compared to placebo plus C/P in subjects with BRCA1or BRCA2germline 
mutation and with HER2-negative metastatic or locally advanced unresectable breast cancer who have received no more than 2 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease.
Veliparib/placebo will be dosed in combination with carboplatin AUC 6 with weekly paclitaxel 
(80mg/m
2), on a 21-day cycle.  Subject randomization will be in a 2:1 ratio to veliparib/C/P or 
placebo/C/P and stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive versus ER/PgR negative, prior platinum therapy (yes versus no), and CNS metastases (yes versus no).
Subjects with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation per local lab testing and who meet the remaining eligibility 
criteria may be randomized.  Patients who meet NCCN guidelines for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing are eligible 
for testing during the screening period.  BRCAmutation status will be documented forall subjects by the 
central laboratory (Myriad).Subjects who discontinue carboplatin and paclitaxel and who have not progressed will continue 
veliparib/placebo as a single agent at the recommended Phase 2 single agent dose.  Subjects will continue dosinguntil they meet the defined treatment discontinuation criteria.  Subjects who discontinue carboplatin, paclitaxel, and veliparib/placebo for reasons other than progression should remain on study.  At the time PD is documented according to RECIST 1.1, subjects randomized to placebo may be eligible to crossover to unblinded veliparib monotherapy.

Methodology (Continued):
Tumor assessments (CT scan or MRI of the full chest, abdomen, pelvis and brain MRI or contrast CT) 
were performed at screening and then every 9 weeksfrom C1D-2 until tumor progressionto determine 
the extent of tumor burden per RECIST 1.1.  Following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, the tumor assessmentintervalmay be increased to every 12 weeksfrom last scan until tumor progression. At the investigator's discretion, the interval between scans may be longer than every 12 weeks for subjects who have durable disease control but must not exceed 24 weeks.  Post-baseline brain MRI or contrast CT is only required in subjects with CNS lesions at baseline; in all other subjects, CNS imaging will be obtained as clinically indicated based upon symptoms indicative of CNS disease. Referto Section 5.3.1.1 and Appendix C, Appendix D, and Appendix E foradditional tumor assessment schedule details, including details for subjects on open-label crossover veliparib.
In addition to being reviewed by the investigator and/or site staff, radiographic scans will be sent to a 
central imaging center for review.  Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression should remain on study and continue to undergo a modified schedule of assessments until disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  For these subjects who meet study treatment discontinuation criteria and who have not progressed (such as subjects who initiate another anti-cancer therapy), tumor assessment data per RECIST 1.1 will continue to be collected to document tumor status and the date of progression.  Post treatment information (including dates and response to subsequent therapies) and survival information will be collected every two months beginning on the date the subject has discontinued study therapy until the endpoint of death, the subject is lost to follow-up or until the study termination by AbbVie.
QoL assessment via the EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires will be collected on 
C1D-2 pre-dose, Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 4 (C6, C8, etc.), Final Visit, and 30-Day Follow-Up Visit.  Subjects who crossover to the unblinded veliparib monotherapy arm will continue to have QoL assessments performed as per this schedule (Day 1 of the first and second cycle of unblinded monotherapy and every other cycle thereafter beginning with Cycle 4 until 2
nddisease progression or until they meet the defined study treatment discontinuation criteria and at 
the Final Visit and 30-Day Follow-Up Visit).  P ain assessment via the BPI-SF will be collected at every 
cycle.

Mode of Administration: Oral
Interim Analyses: To ensure subject safety, anIDMC reviewed unblinded safety data (which included all subjects enrolled in the study) when approximately 60 subjects met at least one of the following criteria:
!Received 6 cycles of treatment
!Reached an event of disease progression
!Discontinued the study due to toxicity/adverse events
Subsequent IDMC reviews of unblinded safety data prior to the primary analysis were carried out based on IDMC recommendations. No additional reviews by the IDMC will occur since the Sponsor management team was unblinded after completing the primary analysis.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Progression-free Survival (PFS):   will be evaluated according to progression per RECIST (version 1.1) 
and survival information (death).  Radiologic tumor response and disease progression will be assessed by CT scan utilizing RECIST (version 1.1).  Assessments werebe performed at Screening, at 9-week intervals (from C1D-2)thereafter until disease progression. Following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4thetumor assessmentinterval may be increased toevery 12weeks from last scan until tumor progression; at investigator discretion, the interval between scans may be longer than 12 weeks but must not exceed 24 weeks.
Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Overall Response 
(DOR):  will be evaluated according to progression per RECIST (version 1.1).  Radiologic tumor 
response and disease progression will be assessed by CT scan utilizing RECIST (version 1.1).  Assessments werebe performed at Screening, at 9-week intervals (from C1D-2) thereafter. Following the primary analysis and implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, the tumor assessmentintervalmay be increased toevery 12 weeks from last scan until tumor progression;at investigator discretion, the interval between scans may be longer than 12 weeks but must not exceed 24weeks.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Overall Survival (OS):   will be evaluated according to survival information and post treatment 
information (including therapy, dates of therapy and response) collected at two month intervals beginning 
on the date the subject is registered off study and until the endpoint of death, the subject is lost to follow-up or until the study termination by AbbVie.
PFS2:  will be evaluated according to survival information and post treatment information (includes 
dates of therapy and response per RECIST 1.1) collected at two-month intervals.
Statistical Methods:   Unless otherwise noted, for all statistical analyses, statistical significance will be 
determined by a two-sided Pvalue ≤ 0.05 when rounded.
Sample Size Determination:
Assuming the true hazard ratio for PFS in favor of the veliparib + C/P group is 0.69, a total of 344 PFS 
events will be needed for the study to have 90% power at 2-sided α level of 0.05 to detect a statistically 
significant treatment effect for the veliparib + C/P group using the log-rank test for progression free survival.  A total of approximately 500subjects will be enrolled into the study.
Efficacy (Primary and Secondary Endpoints):The analysis of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints will include only the subjects who have 
been documented to have suspected deleterious or deleterious mutations by the Sponsor core lab.  The primary and secondary analyses will be based upon the investigator's assessment of response and disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  Sensitivity analyses of PFS, ORR, and CBR based on radiological and clinical assessment by the Central Imaging Center will be conducted.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS):   will be defined as the number of days from the date the subject is 
randomized to the date the subject experiences disease progression, or to the date of death (all causes of 
mortality) if disease progression is not reached.
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR):   will be defined as the progression-free rate at 24 weeks from the 
Kaplan-Meier curve for time to progression (defined as from the date of randomization to the date of 
disease progression).
Overall Survival (OS):   Time to death for a given subject will be defined as the number of days from the 
day the subject is randomized to the date of the subject's death.  All events of death will be included, 
regardless of whether the event occurs while the subject is still taking study drug, or after the subject discontinues study drug.  If a subject has not died, then the data will be censored at the date when the subject is last known to be alive.
Objective Response Rate (ORR):   (CR and PR) will be defined as the proportion of subjects with a 
complete or partial objective response based on RECIST (version 1.1).  All subjects who have had at 
least one measurable lesion at baseline will be included inthe ORR calculation.
PFS2:  will be defined as the number of days from the day the subject is randomized to the date that the 
subject has disease progression or death of any cause on the subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first.Safety:  Safety will be assessed by evaluating study drug exposure, adverse events, serious adverse 
events, all deaths, as well as changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign parameters.  Subjects who are randomized but do not receive study drug (veliparib or placebo) will not be included in the analyses of safety.  Safety analysis results will be presented by treatment group.

h. For Day 1 visits, study samples for central laboratory analysis may be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing.  
For Day 8 and Day 15 visits, study samples for central laboratory analysis may be performed within 24 hours of the 
scheduled day.  There is no visit window for C1D-2 as any sample prior to randomization is still considered to be screening.  A qualified (e.g., certification or accreditation) local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory analyses for treatment decisions but this cannot replace the central laboratory analysis on a protocol defined visit.
j. For patients on prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin, INR should be monitored before each 
treatment.  Treatment should be held for INR of > 1.5 × ULN on prophylactic warfarin or > therapeutic range if on full dose warfarin.
l. Tumor assessments to support evidence of PD for PFS and/or PFS2 endpoints will beconducted every 9 weeks 
until PD, death or withdrawal of consent for follow-up until PD. (tumor assessments may be conducted 5 days prior or 5days following the scheduled assessment from C1D-2).
Note: Study procedures (excluding labs and tumor assessments) may be performed four (4) days prior to the 
scheduled study visit date.  C1D1 procedures may be performed within 24 hours surrounding the scheduled study visit.

b. All subjects will have one Follow-up Visit approximately 30 days after they have met study discontinuation criteria.  This Fo llow-up Visit does not need to be performed for 
subjects who have had a Final Visit conducted ≥ 30 days after the last dose of study drug or for subjects who are entering unblinded veliparib monotherapy treatment.  
Follow-up visits should not precede a Final Visit.
c. If a subject meets criteria for study discontinuation, survival and post treatment therapy will be collected every two months  (unless requested by sponsor more frequently to 
support data analysis) beginning on the date the subject is registered off study.  All randomized subjects should be followed f or disease progression (PFS) and for the 
secondprogression (PFS2), until the endpoint of death (OS), until the subject has become lost to follow-up, or until study term ination by AbbVie.

a. For subjects who have been receiving single-agent veliparib/placebo at a stable dosewithout adjustments for 
multiple cycles and who have no ongoing study drug related uncontrolled AEs, it is possible to alternate on-site 
visits and phone visits by the investigator or designee every other cycle.  Ata minimum, subjects should have an on-site visit every other cycle. If an on-site visit is not  possible for 2 consecutive cycles,or if the subjectis not on 
a stable dose or hasongoing study drug related uncontrolled AEsbut wishes to alternate on-site and phone visits, the plan for the subject's visits should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD (see Section 7.0for contact 
information).
b. During the on-site visitstheInvestigator or designeewillprovide the PRO Questionnaires(QLQ C30, BR23, EQ 
5D 5L and BPI-SF) for the next cycle to the subject, so these can be completed at home.
c. QLQ C30, BR23, EQ 5D 5L questionnaires will be administered every other cycle prior to dosing beginning with 
Cycle 2 (C2, C4, C6, etc.).  If questionnaires were completed during an on-site visit, they may not be required at the subsequent phone visit.
d. In addition to assessing AEsand Concomitant Therapies, the investigator or designee should assess treatment 
compliance and to the extent possible, assess for any clinical evidence of disease progression.  If there are concerns about new or worsening AEs or if there is suspicion of disease progression, an unscheduled on-site visit, local labs,and/or tumor assessment should be scheduled.
e. During the on-site visits,theInvestigator or designeewill dispense medication for 2 cycles via IRT and the double 
amount of Dosing Cards, so subjects can complete them for both cycles.
Note: Phone visit may be performed four (4) business days prior or after the scheduled study visit date.

Page 55of 72In cases of doubt, whether an AE fulfils a serious criterion or not, there should be a 
predisposition to report as a SAE rather than not report as such
8.9.3 Recording instructions
Each subject with an AE occurring after randomization andthrough study  exit should be 
fully  recorded in the source document for further transcription to the eCRF.  Each subject 
should be questioned about AEs ateach study  visit following randomization .The question 
asked should be,“Since your last clinical visit have you had any health problems?” 
Informat ion on AEs can also be obtained from signs and symptoms detected during each 
examination.  
When an AE is related to a device deficiency  including technical device malfunction, the 
AE should be recorded in the AE eCRF and technical complaint should be reported 
separately  on the study  complaint form.  
Investigators, or other study  site personnel, should record all AEs in the eCRF, including:
a)Event term (recorded in standard medical terminology  and avoiding abbreviations)
b) Description of event and affected ar ea 
c)Start date (first day  with sy mptoms)
d)Stop date (last day  with sy mptoms)
e)Intensit y (mild, moderate, or severe according to definition in Section 8.9.3.1)
f)Seriousness (serious or not serious, according to definition in Secti on 8.9.3.2)
g)Causal relationship to study  product or study  product injection procedure (y es or no)
h)Action taken (none, medication treatment, non-medication treatment, or other 
procedures/tests, subject withdrawn)
i)Outcome of the AE(ongoing, recovered, recovered with sequelae, death, chronic/ 
stable, not recovered at the end of the stud y)
The pre -defined, expected post-treatment events should be assessed separately . These 
events should be collected by  subjects in a diary  used daily  for 28days after the treatment .
8.9.3.1 Intensity
Intensit y will be recorded for each reported AE. The following definitions of intensity  are to 
be used:
Mild : Awareness of s ymptoms or signs, but easily  tolerated (acceptable )
Moderate: Enough d iscomfort to interfere with usual activity  (disturbing) 
Severe: Incapacity  to work or to do usual activity  (unacceptable) 
If the intensity  changes within one day, the maximum intensity  of the AEduring that day 
should be recorded.

Page 56of 728.9.3.2 Causal relationship and seriousness
Each AE, serious as well as non-serious, should be assessed by the Investigator for causal 
relationship with the study  product and its use(the injection procedure) and for seriousness
(Yes or No)of the event . 
A two -point scale (Yes or Noresponse ) should be used for the causalit y assessments . The 
Investigators should be asked to indicate aresponse to each of the following questions in the 
eCRF :
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may have been 
caused b y the study product ?”,and 
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may have been 
caused b y the device injection procedure?”
If any of these questions is answered ‘Yes’, the AE is considered related.
Each AEwill also be ass essed for causal relationship and seriousness by  the Sponsor , in order 
to fulfil regulatory  requirements. 
8.9.4 Reporting of adverse events 
Adverse event reporting on each subject should start a fter the subject has been randomized .  
The reporting should contin ue during each follow -up visit (including telephone contacts 
and extra visits between planned visits) until the last scheduled visit in the study .
All AEs, non -serious as well as serious, are to be reported as an AE in the eCRF.
8.9.5 Reporting of serious adver se events
The Investigator should report any  SAE to the Sponsor immediately but not later than 24 
hours of awareness of the event . This initial report can be made via e- mail.
In case of difficult y to obtain all the required information within 24 hours, an initial report 
can be submitted, with the following information as a minimum, irrespective of whether 
some of it is regarded as preliminary :
CTN: 43USCH1702
Subject identification (age, gender, subject number)
Adverse event description
Date when AE occurre d
Date when AE became serious
Name of Investigator and original reporter (if other than the Investigator) 
Name of device: Restylane®Defyne (investigational) 
Treatment specification
Follow -up information and data missing in the initial SAE reporting should be gathered as 
soon as possible and reported immediately  but not later than 24 hours of awareness of the 
new data.  Complete and adequate information on each SAE is required.  All attempts to 
obtain this information, including dates for follow -up activi ties, must be documented by  the 
Investigator or designated study  staff.

The SAE f orm must be signed and dated by the Investigator .  If the initial 24-hour SAE 
report does not contain full information or if it is made without using the SAE form the 
fully  completed and signed SAE form should be e- mailed to the Sponsor . A copy  of the 
fully  completed SAE form should be kept at the site.
In addition, the Investigator should report SAEs to the responsible IRB without undue 
delay, if applicable according to national regulations.  The Investigator is responsible for 
checking what reporting procedures are applicable for his/her IRB regarding SAEs and 
final report of the outcome of the study  and to comply  with such reporting procedures 
during the study  period . For non-urgent complementary  information not possible to send by 
e-mail or fax, please use surface mail.
8.9.6 Stopping Rule
Enrollment into the study will be temporarily  halted if the Sponsor receives a SAE for a 
vascular embolic event thatlead to skin necrosis, vison loss, or stroke andis determined by 
the Investigator to be directly  or possibly  related to the study  device or injection procedure.  
The SAE will be investigated b y the Sponsor.  If the Sponsor’s investigation conc ludes:
The SAE was unanticipated, directl y related to the study  product or device injection 
procedure, and presents an unreasonable risk to study  subjects, the study  will be 
terminated and the Investigators notified.  The IRB and RA will also be notified if the 
study  is prematurel y terminated due to safet y concerns.  
If the SAE does not meet the above criteria, then enrollment in the study  will 
continue.  
8.9.7 Follow -up of ongoing related events after termination of the study  and events with 
onset after termination of study  (subject last visit)
All serious as well as non-serious AEs with a causal relationship to the study  product or 
treatment procedure and ongoing at study  end, should be followed up after the subject's 
participation in the study  is over.  Suchevents should be followed- up after the last study 
visit until resolved, or assessed as chronic or stable.  All AEs assessed as related to the

8.9.8 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  itself is not rega rded as an AE.
If there is a pregnancy  after the subject has been treated, the subject must continue to be 
followed and the outcome of pregnancy  must be reported even if the delivery  occurs after 
study  completion.
A pregnancy  confirmed during the study  period after treatment must be reported by the 
Investigator on a pregnancy report form immediately upon acknowledgement and 
submitted to the Sponsor according to contact details specified in Section 8.9.5. The report 
can be prospective or retrospective. Follow -up should be conducted to obtain outcome 
information on all prospective reports. 
Cases that led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality  or birth defect are to 
be regarded as SAEs and should be reported onthe exposure in utero report form to the 
Sponsor immediately  but no later than 24 hours after the Investigators awareness. These 
events should be handled as SAEs during data processing. Other complications during the 
pregnancy  that are related to the pregnant woman and fulfils any serious criteria, such as 
pre-eclampsia requiring hospitalization , should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective 
abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs.
8.9.9 Anticipated adverse events
Information regarding anticipated AEs for Resty lane®Defy ne(investigational ) isincluded 
in the study  specific IFU. 
8.10 Device deficiencies
8.10.1 Definition of a device deficiency
A device deficiency  is defined as an inadequacy  of a medical device with respect to its 
identity , quality , durability , reliability , safety1, or performance.
Note: Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors ,and inadequate labelling.
8.10.2 Recording instructions
When a device deficiency  is discovered, Part A of the clinical study  complaint form should
be completed by the Investigator or qualified designee. The type of complaint should be 
described and injury  to the subject or user or unintended exposure to study  product should
be reported as applicable. If an injury  has occurred, an AE or an SAE form should be 
completed as applicable (refer to Section 8.9.4and 8.9.5 ). If no SAE was experienced as a 
result of the device deficiency  the Investigator should assess whether or not the device 
deficiency could have led to an SAE if:
Suitable action had not been taken,
Intervention had not been made or,
                                                
1Inadequacy of device safety refers to properties of the device which could have or have led to an AE.

In Part B of the clinical study  complaint form the Sponsor will make the same asses sment.
8.10.3 Reporting of device deficiencies
The Investigator should send the completed clinical study  complaint form to the Sponsor by 
email to A device deficiency  that led to a SAE and 
any device deficiency  that is assessed as it could have led to a SAE should be reported 
within 24 hours after the Investigator’s awareness in accordance to Section 8.9.5.
In order to fulfil regulatory  reporting requirements, all deficiencies with the study  product 
must be assessed by both the Investigator and the Sponsor to determine if it could have led 
to a SAE.
If a SAE has resulted from a device deficiency  or if either the Investigator or theSponsor 
assesses that the device deficiency  could have led to a SAE the Sponsor is responsible for 
reporting the device deficiency  to RA and the PI is responsible for reporting it to the IRB.
The deficient study  product should be kept by the study  site until the Sponsor has 
confirmed whether the product should be returned to Sponsor for further study  or if it can 
be destro yed at the study site .
9.Data Handling and Management 
9.1 Data management
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities defined to achieve safe routines to 
enter clinical data information into a database, efficientl y and avoiding errors. The data 
management routine includes procedures for handling eCRFs, database set -up and 
management, data entry  and verification, data validation, and documentation of the 
performed activities including information of discrepancies in the process. The data 
management process will be described in detail in the data management plan (DMP).
The database, the data entry  screens and program will be designed in accordance with the CI P 
and the eCRF. Data validation will be performed by computerized logical checks and manual 
review. Drugs and events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization 
(WHO) Drug and medical dictionary  for regulatory  activitie s (MedDRA) dictionaries as 
specified in the DMP. SAEs in the clinical database will be reconciled against the data in the 
safet y database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in 
the database is as corre ct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study  
data will be transferred to SAS datasets which thereafter will be write -protected. Statistical 
analyses will be generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.
9.2 Electronic case r eport forms
A 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 11-compliant electronic data capture application will 
be used to collect, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit study  data.  An eCRF is 
required and should be completed electronicall y for each screen failure as well as enrolled 
subjects. 
The eCRF includes password protection and internal quality  checks, such as automatic range 
checks, to identify  data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.  Study  data should

Page 60of 72be entered directl y from the source documents, which are to be defined at each site before 
inclusion of the first subject.
Authorized study  site personnel designated by the Investigator should complete data 
collection. Appropriate training and securit y measures should be complet ed with all 
authorized investigation site personnel prior to the study  being initiated and any data being 
entered into the s ystem for any  subject.
The study  data is the sole propert y of the Sponsor and should not be made available in any 
form to third part ies, except for authorized representatives of appropriate RA, without written 
permission from the Sponsor.  At the end of the study , electronic data are kept at the Sponsor 
and a copy (provided b y the vendor) at the study  site as part of the Investigator f ile.
Any delegation of collection of data should be specified in a signature and delegation log.
9.2.1 Data entry
All data should be entered in English. The eCRFs should alway s reflect the latest 
observations on the subjects participating in the study . Therefore , the eCRFs should be 
completed as soon as possible during or after the subject’s visit. The subject’s identity  must 
always remain confidential, i.e. the name and address of the subjects must not be registered 
in the eCRFs or in the database. The Investiga tor must verify  that all data entries in the 
eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some assessments are not done, or if certain information 
is not available, not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the 
eCRF. The Investigator should electronicall y sign off the study  data. By signing, the 
Investigator takes responsibility  for the accuracy , completeness, and legibility  of the data 
reported to the Sponsor in the eCRF . 
9.2.2 The query  process
The monitor should review the eCRFs and evaluate t hem for completeness and consistency . 
Each eCRF should be compared with the respective source documents to ensure that there 
are no discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections, and alterations should be 
made by the PI  or his/her authorize ddesignee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. 
Once study  data have been submitted to the central server via the eCRF, corrections to the 
data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person 
who made the change, together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the 
site personnel responsible for entering study  data into the eCRF should be determined in 
advance. If discrepant data is detected during review of the data, either by  the Sponsor or i ts 
representatives, the responsible data manager or monitor should raise a query  in the 
electronic data capture application. The query  should state the question or data to be 
changed and should be resolved in the sy stem by  the PI or his/her authorized designee. The 
appropriate study  site personnel should answer the queries in the eCRF. This will be audit 
trailed by the electronic data capture application meaning that the name of study  site 
personnel, time, and date is logged .
9.2.3 U seridentification
eCRF records will be automatically  appended with the identification of the creator, by 
means of their unique User ID. Specified records should be electronically  signed by the 
Investigator to document his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are 
accurate. This will be facilitated by means of the Investigator’s unique User ID and 
password; date and time stamps will be added automatically  at time of electronic signature.

All changes will be fully recorded in a protected audit trail and a reason for the change 
should be stated. Once all data have been entered, verified, and validated, the database will 
be locked .
9.3 Source documents
Source documents are all documents used by the Investigator or hospital that relate to the 
subject’s medical history , that verifies the existence of the subject, the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, and all records covering the subject’s partic ipation in the study .  They 
include laboratory  notes, memoranda, material dispensing records, subject files, etc.
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents.  These should be made 
available for inspection by the monitor at each monito ring visit.  The Investigator must 
submit a completed eCRF for each subject for whom signed informed consent has been 
collected.  All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory  or 
hospital records, should be clearl y identified wit h the CTN and subject number. Any  personal 
information, including name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual 
confidentiality .
9.4 Record keeping and access to source data
The Investigator/Institution should permit study -related monito ring, audits, IRB review, and 
RA inspections and should provide direct access to the source data/medical record including 
the identity  of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, i.e. eCRF, 
medical records, original signed inform ed consent forms and detailed records of study  
product accountability ).  The records should be retained by the Investigator as required by 
local legislation and international guidelines.  Any transfer of responsibility for storage of the 
records should be documented and the Sponsor should be informed in writing.
The Sponsor should verify  that each subject has consented in writing to direct access to the 
original medical record/source data (by the use of written subject information and signed 
informed consen t).  The data recorded in the eCRFs will be checked for consistency  with the 
source documents/medical record by  the monitor during monitoring (source data verification; 
SDV).  In order to be able to perform SDV, information about each subject’s participati on in 
the study  has to be detailed in the medical record. 
9.5 D ocument and d ata retention
All records pertaining to the conduct of the study , including signed eCRFs, informed consent 
forms, study  product accountability  records, source documents, and other study 
documentation must be retained for as long as is specified in the CTA.  Measures should be 
taken to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents (e.g. protection 
against damage and unauthorized access, preferably b y storage in a fire -proof cabinet). 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility  to inform the Sponsor in writing if the Investigator file is 
moved or if the responsibility  for the documents is transferred to someone else .

strict confidentiality.
12.Quality Control and Quality Assurance
12.1 Quality control
On-site monitoring of the study  will be arranged by the Sponsor according to GCP guidelines 
to verify  that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protected, the reported data are 
accurate, complete, verifiable from source documents, and that the conduct of the study  
complies with the approved CIP, subsequent amendment(s), GCP and the applicable 
regulatory  requirements. 
Any CIP deviation should be reported in the eCRF, which will be verified, discussed, and 
collected, by the monitor and appropriate actions will be taken.  The Investigator is 
responsible for promptly reporting any deviations from the CIP that affects the rights, safet y 
or well-being of the subject or the scientific integrit y of the study , including those, which
occur under emergency circumstances, to the Sponsor as well as the IRB if required by 
national regulations.  Deviations will be reviewed to determine the need to amend the CIP or 
to terminate the study .  Handling of CIP deviations will be performed as described in the 
monitoring manual .
12.2 Quality assurance
The study  site may be subject to quality  assurance audit by the Sponsor as well as inspection 
by appropriate R A.  It is important that the Investigator and other relevant study  site 
personnel are available during the monitoring visits, possible audits, and inspections, and that 
sufficient time is devoted to the monitoring process.
Each participating member of the study  site team should provide a curriculum vitae (CV) or 
equivalent that demonstrates their qualifications to conduct the study .  
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to ensure that all personnel involved in the study  are 
fully  informed of all relevant aspects of the study , including detailed knowledge of and 
training in all procedures to be followed.  All Investigators and other responsible persons 
should be listed together with their function in the study  on a signature and delegation log .

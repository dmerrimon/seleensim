Primary Objective  The primary objective  of the study is to evaluate the ability of the MAKO 7 device 
to collect samples  from the fallopian tube for cytological evaluation that are 
adequate to enable  determination and/or differentiation of normal versus 
atypical versus malignant cells.  
Study Design  The study is a prospective, multi -center, observational study. Study subjects will 
be recruited from a population of women who are already scheduled to undergo  
salpingo -oophorectomy. The study protocol requires hysteroscopic sampling of 
the fallopian tube with the MAKO 7 device at the time of  scheduled surgery.   
Cytology results will be compared to surgical pathology results from salpingo -
oophorectomy specimen but the cytology results will not be shared with the study 
Subject or study Investigator .  
Any baseline testing , pat hology evaluations,  and all other clinical care  will be in 
accordance with each participating institution’s standard of care  for patients 
undergoing salpingo -oophorectomy . 
Risk Status  The MAKO 7 device will be used in subjects at the time of  scheduled surgery . 
Because the tissue that the MAKO 7 device contacts will be removed and because 
the device has been  cleared by the FDA  for use in obtaining samples from the

CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 6 of 21 1. Introduction  
Sponsor  has developed the MAKO 7 d evice  to be used through the working channel of a hysteroscope  
for cell collection from the fallopian tube . Hysteroscopy allows the physician to readily locate and 
evaluate the tubal ostium. Once the ostium is located, the MAKO 7 device will be placed through t he 
working channel of the hysteroscope and subsequently deployed through the length of the fallopian 
tube. The MAKO 7 device is cleared as a hysteroscope accessory, placed through the working channel 
of a hysteroscope to obtain samples from the fallopian t ube for cytological evaluation. This study will 
include evaluation of those  samples , to determine if they are adequate to  enable determination and/or 
differentiation of normal vs.  atypical vs. malignant cells.  
This study will be conducted using a n Institutional  Review Board (IRB) approved  protocol at multiple 
centers. The Sponsor of this clinical study has the overall responsibility for the conduct of the study, 
including assurance that the study will be performed according to the clinical protocol, Title 21 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 812 and other relevant Federal Dru g Administration ( FDA) regulations , the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH)  Guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice s (GCP).  
2. Background  
Cytologic  evaluation of cells collected from the female genital tract has yielded clinically useful 
information since the 1920s. Evaluation of cells for atypical or malignant features has, in fact, been 
used effectively to identify individuals who  may be at increased risk for malignancy. It could prove 
useful to develop a system/device that could atraumatically, and minimally invasively, collect cells from 
the fallopian tube  that could be evaluated cytologically for  the presence or absence of atypi cal or 
malignant features . 
In 2015 , work was done  to develop a minimally invasive method for cell collection from the fallopian 
tube1, but until the MAKO 7, no such method ha d been developed that reliably collects cells from this 
part of the anatomy . The original technique used a hyste roscopic accessory with a brush -like device to 
attempt collection of cell sample s from the fallopian tube. Collection of a sample adequate for cytologic 
evaluation was successful in less than two out of seven  subjects  and the brush advanced only 2 -3 cm 
into the proximal fallopian tube . Access to the fallopian tube, tortuosity and the narrow inner diameter 
of the fallopian tube have been challeng ing. 
The MAKO 7 was evaluated in 40 subjects (80 fallopian tubes) who were already scheduled to undergo 
a laparoscopic tubal ligation.  Study endpoints included 1) ability of the device to navigate the fallopian  
tube, 2) ability of the device to collect a sample adequate for cytological evaluation, and 3) adverse 
events.  Access was achieved in 71/80 (89%) fallopian tubes.  The remaining 9 tubes were determined 
to have pre -existing tubal occlusion, as determined by methylene blue dye injection (in two of the tubes 
not initially accessed, a second access and navigation was successful after incidental clearing of tubal 
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 7 of 21 blockage after methylene blue dye injection) .  The study pathologist determined that 70/71 (99%) o f 
the samples were adequate for cytological evaluation.   There were no device -related adverse events 
reported.  
3. Study Indications for Use  
The MAKO 7  is a hysteroscope accessory, placed t hrough the working channel of a hysteroscope to 
obtain sam ples from the fallopi an tube for  cytological evaluation that are adequate to enable  
determination and/or differentiation of normal versus atypical versus malignant cells . 
4. MAKO 7 Device Description  
As shown in Figure 1, the device is comprised of a catheter and a handle. The catheter includes a 
balloon , a shaft  (which is made up of a stainless steel tube and a Nylon tube ), a sheath , and a sheath 
knob. The handle includes a drive wheel and a luer in the handle body. The luer attaches to a 
commercially available inflation device via a commercially available 3-way stopcock.

knobcatheter handle
luer
 
In summary, the physician inserts the MAKO 7 d evice into the working channel of the hysteroscope 
until the distal tip of the catheter is positioned immediately proximal to the  ostium of a fallopian tube. 
Then  the balloon is advanced into the fallopian  tube and cells  are collected on its surface. The balloon 
length is limited and therefore cannot be extended further than 7cm into the fallopian tube.  
In order to enable balloon advancement, the balloon and shaft are pressurized with a commercially 
available inflation device that is attached to the device . Once the device  is pressurized, the  user rotates 
the drive wheel, which causes a push wire inside the device to  advance. This causes  the balloon to evert 
linearly (gradually unfold from the inside out ).  
This balloon  that has been everted during the preparation step  is advanced into the proximal end of 
the fallopian tube. Further eversion ( extension ) of the balloon  into the fallopian tube  is accomplished 
by further rotation of the drive wheel  on the handle . The n the  balloon is deflated by reliev ing pressure 
in the  commercially available inflation  device . Because the balloon fills the potential space  of the 
fallopian tube, the balloon  surface makes contact with  the surface area  of the  inside of the fallopian 
tube. This surface area contact optimize s cell collection   
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 8 of 21 The device is  then  retracted into the sheath and removed from the working channel of the 
hysteroscope and from the Subject . Once the device is removed from the Subject , cells can be removed 
from the balloon by dipping the balloon into a cytopreservative and stirring in order to agitate the cells. 
Alternatively, both balloon and sheath can be cut off and placed into a cytopreservative.  
Please see the MAKO 7 device Instruction for Use (IFU) docum ent for more details.  
5. Study Scope and Duration  
We expect the study to begin in August of 2016 and end in July 2017.  Subjects will be in the  study from 
the time of informed consent until  study exit, which is  24 hours  post -MAKO 7 use or post -operative 
discharge, whichever occurs first . Study -related contacts  are limited to  the pre -operative  informed 
consent and performance of fallopian tube sampling with the MAKO 7  device at the time of scheduled 
surgery.  
6. Primary Objective  
The primary objective  of the study is to evaluate the ability of the MAKO 7 device to collect specimens  
from the fallopian  tube for cytological evaluation that are adequate to enable  determination and/or 
differentiation of normal versus atypical versus malignant cells .  
7. Study Design  
The study is a prospective, multi -center, observational study. Study su bjects will be recruited from a 
population of women who are already scheduled to undergo  salpingo -oophorectomy. Subjects will be 
recruited until at least 10 subjects with surgical pathology detecting atypia or malignancy have been 
enrolled  or a maximum  enrollment of 50 subjects  is reached . 
The study protocol requires hysteroscopic sampling of cells from the fallopian tube with the MAKO 7 
device at the time of scheduled surgery. Samples will be transferred to a cytopreservativ e and delivered 
to a board -certified  study pathologist to undergo cytologic evaluation according to a standard  
classification system. Fallopian tube cytology  results will then be compared to fallopian tube 
histopathology res ults generated from the surgically excised ovarian and fallopian tube specimens .  
Any baseline testing, pathology evaluations,  and all other clinical care will be in accordance with each 
participating institution’s standard of care  for patients undergoing salpingo -oophorectomy .  
After consent, a t the time of scheduled surgery , the MAKO 7 procedure  will be performed . Following 
placement of the hysteroscope,  the fallopian tube ostium i s located, the distal tip of the device will be 
placed at the tubal ostium and the balloon will be deployed through the fallopian tube.  Cells are 
captured on the surface  of the balloon . The balloon will then be retracted into the device’s sheath. The 
device is then withdrawn from the working channel of the hysteroscope and the distal end of the device 
will be cut and placed in a cytopreservative. The sample will be labeled with the Subj ect’s study 
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 9 of 21 identification number and then  transferred along with appropriate laboratory requisition, also labeled 
with the Subject’s study identification number, to a Cytology Core Lab, which  will be used  for all sites .  
Cytological  analysis will be performed by a board -certified  pathologist blinded to the surgical pathology 
results  .  
Once the ovary (ies)  and fallopian tube (s) have been surgically excised, they will be sent to the 
pathology center of the clinical site. The fallopian tube  cytology results generated by use of MAKO 7 
device will be compared to the fallopian tube surgical pathology results . The cytology sample will be 
evaluated for adequacy in enabling determination and/or differentiation of normal versus atypical 
versus malignant cells.  The cytology report will include classification of the cytology sample.

The objectives of this study do not re quire a statistically powered sample size.  Descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables will be calculated including measures of central tendency, dispersion, summary 
statistics, and a count of the number of missing values.  Categorical variables will be summarized with 
counts and proportions.  
8.1. Primary Endpoint   
Results from histopathology evaluation of the surgical fallopian tube specimens will be compared 
to corresponding results from cytologic evaluation of fallopian tube samples.  The following 2x2 
contingency table (Table 1) will be constructed to calculate the overall percent agreement  
between the fallopian tubes .

9. Safety and Adverse Events  
The FDA has already cleared the MAKO 7 for use in collecting samples from the fallopian tube.  Also, 
the device will be used in anatomy that will be immediately excised  after device use.  As such, this study 
will be conducted as  a non -significant risk study per 21 CFR 812. 2(b). Subjects participating in the study 
are already scheduled to under go salpingo -oophorectomy  with the attendant  risks of that surgery . Any 
events that occur as a result of the planned surgery will be medically managed by the Subject ’s 
physician per the institution’s standard of care. The study de vice and procedure present minimal 
additional risk to subject s participating in this study, since the contacted anatomy will be removed from 
the Subject  immediately after study device use.   Standard risks associated with hysteroscopic 
                                                           
1 Neoplastic cells present and malignant cells present  are considered  Atypia/Malignancy detected (a positive result).  
2 Reactive atypia present and benign (normal) are considered Atypia/Malignancy not detected (a negative result).  
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 11 of 21 instruments include perforation, infection a nd bleeding. It is not expected that the MAKO 7  device is 
associated with any increased risks as compared to commercially available hysteroscopic instruments.  
The MAKO 7 device procedure  will increase the amount of time that the Subject  is under general 
anesthesia by an estimated additional 5-7 minutes. Additional MAKO 7 risks and mitigations are noted 
in Table 3  (section 11.1  below ). There is the potential that unknown risks exist .  
Adverse events and device malfunctions will be reported, evaluated and summarized by the 
Investigator on a standard case report form from the time a Subject is consented and enrolled into the 
study until 24  hours post -MAKO 7 use or post -operative discharge, whichever comes first (i.e.  exited 
from the study ). For additional details on adverse events  reporting requirements , see Section 11 .1.

confirmation (email or letter) from Sponsor  that the site can start.  In addition, the following 
documentation must be in the  Sponsor Trial Master File:    
• IRB approval letter for the clinical protocol , informed consent form , and  recruitment 
materials  
• Fully executed Clinical Trial  Agreement  
• Site Investigator Qualification Report  
• Delegation of Authority Form  
• Executed Non -Disclosure Agreement  
• Curriculum Vitae ( Investigator, Sub-investigator, research coordinator) – current within 2 
years, signed and dated, must show current affili ation with clinical site  
• Current medical or professional license  
• Laboratory Certificates  
• Training Records (device  and  clinical protocol ) 
 
10.7. Criteria for Terminating Study  
Sponsor  reserves the right to stop the enrollment of subjects  at any time after the Study Initiation 
Visit if no subjects  have been enrolled or due to significant or continued non -compliance with the 
protocol.

CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 15 of 21 11. Study Plan Procedures  
 
Subject charts will be previewed for study eligibility.  If the Subject meets all eligibility criteria and agrees 
to participate in the study, informed consent will be obtained prior to any study related procedures .  
Study enrollment begins at the time that the Subject provides informed consent.   
Clinical data will be collected on all subjects beginning at the time of  informed consent (i.e. enrollment), 
through  study  exit,  which is  24 hours post -MAKO 7 use or at post -operative  discharge, whichever 
occurs first .  Clinical data with subject identifiers redacted, will be abstracted from the Subject’s 
medical records and other source documents  in order to complete study case report forms  (CRFs). 
Surgical pathology information and cyt ological evaluation of MAKO 7 obtained samples will also  be 
collected  using case report forms (CRFs). Sponsor monitors (or designees) will review the data 
submitted per the monitoring plan. Informed Consent and data  will be 100% source ve rified.   
Each subject will be assigned a unique study identification number, which de -identifies the individual 
and contains no protected health information (PHI). Study identification numbers will be assigned at 
the site sponsor using a prescribed procedu re. Each site will maintain a screening and enrollment log 
key that links the Subject’s study identification number to the PHI, is stored in a secure location at the 
site and is only accessible to the site personnel and the Sponsor . 
Any source documentation (procedure reports, lab reports, etc.) that is sent to the Sponsor will have 
all subject  identifiers removed and be identified only with the Subject ’s study identification 
number(ID).  
STUDY CONTACTS : 
There are two study related contacts  that require the participation of the Subject , however, they could 
occur on the same visit.   
1. Screening, consent and enrollment:  
If patient meets all eligibility requirements and decides to participate in the study after 
complete review of the informed consent form and study procedures including risks 
and benefits of participation, written informed consent will be obtained . 
 
 
2. MAKO 7 procedure:  
MAKO 7 procedure for collection of cells from the fallopian tube wi ll be performed at 
the time of  scheduled salpingo -oophorectomy.  
 
DATA COLLECTION :

nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 17 of 21 11.1. Adverse Event  Reporting  
Adverse events will be reported on the standardized Adverse Event  case report form . Adverse 
events will be recorded  from the time the Subject signs the informed consent and is enrolled in 
the study through study exit  (where exit is defined as 24 hours post -MAKO 7 use or post -operative 
discharge, whichever occurs  first).Table  All adverse events will be categorized for severity , 
seriousness,  and relatedness to the MAKO 7 device or MAKO 7  procedure. In addition, if the 
Investigator determines that the adverse event is serious (whether anticipated or unanticipated), 
a Serious Adverse Event  case report form will be completed and the IRB is notified in accordance 
with local requirements.   The Sponsor should also be notified within 24 hours of all serious 
adverse events  (whether anticipated or unanticipated).  This will ensure any related device 
investigations  are performed by the Sponsor and any Sponsor reporting can be completed per the 
FDA requirements in 21 CFR part 812.  
All adverse event s that are  serious (whether an ticipated or unanticipated), MAKO 7 device -
related , or MAKO 7 procedure -related , will be tracked to resolution  or until stable and not 
expected to change.  Since subjects participating in the study are already scheduled to undergo a 
salpingo -oophorectomy w ith the attendant risks of that surgery, all other adverse events that are 
open at Subject study exit (24 hours post -MAKO 7 use or post -operative discharge, whicheve r 
occurs  first) will be closed upon Subject study exit.  
The associated MAKO 7 risks and mitigation strategy are detailed in Table 3 below.  
Table 3. Potential Adverse Events related to the MAKO 7 d evice and Mitigation Strategy  
Risk Mitigation  
Perforation of the 
fallopian tube is a risk 
because of its tortuosity 
and narrow dimensions.  
 a. No rigid portion of the device enters the fallopian tube. Instead, a 
very small balloon (less than 1 mm diameter) i s everted through 
the tube. Because the balloon is self -navigating, the eversion of 
the balloon will minimize  the physician’s manual advancement of 
the device through the tube and therefore the risk of perforation 
is expected to be minimized.  
b. A salpingo -oophorectomy will be performed directly after the 
MAKO 7 d evice procedure.  
A foreign object will be 
introduced into the 
Subject  and therefore 
infection may occur.  c. A sterilize d device will be supplied to the physician.  
d. The Instructions for Use mandate sterile technique.  
This study could 
prolong the time the 
Subject  is under general 
anesthesia by an 
estimated 5 -7 minutes.  e. Prior to the study, the physician will be trained on the bench on 
how to use the MAKO 7 d evice accurately and in an efficient 
manner, therefore minimizing overall operative time.

11.2. Protocol Deviations  
All protocol deviations are to be documented on the Protocol Deviation Log and the IRB is notified 
by the Investigator per local requirements .  
11.3. Device Accountability and Malfunctions  
11.3.1.  Device and Labeling Accountability  
The Sponsor and Investigator are jointly responsible for the accountability of every unit of 
Investigational product and investigational supplies used for the clinical study.  
Sponsor  will supply the MAKO 7 d evice. An inventory of clean and sterile MAKO 7 d evices 
will either be shipped or brought to the investigational site.  Packaging will be labeled 
“Investigational Device” and the Instructions for Use (IFU) will accompany each product in 
the shipment.    
11.3.2.  Device Supply Storage  
Sponsor  clinical supplies provided  under this investigational protocol can only be used for 
procedures under this investigational protocol.  Clinical supplies provided for this 
investigational protocol must be kept in a designated secure location and may not be mixed 
with commercial invent ory for any other purpose.  
All investigational supplies will be stored according to manufacturer specifications and 
separately from supplies purchased by the site for procedures not covered under this 
investigational protocol.  
11.3.3.  Device Malfunction  
If invest igational product is determined to be unacceptable for use, then the product shall 
be returned to the Sponsor  promptly.  If a product used during the study is thought to be 
defective or has malfunctioned , the Sponsor should be notified in writing within 48 hours  
and whenever possible the  device should  be returned  to the Sponsor .  
12. Laboratory testing  
Cytology samples will be placed in cytopreservative following removal of the device from the Subject. 
An adhesive label with the study identification number will be applied to the specimen container and 
to the clinical laboratory requisi tion form. Samples will then be shipped or hand -carried by the 
Sponsor to the Cytology Core Lab . 
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 19 of 21 Samples will be received and accessioned at the Cytology Core Lab . The laboratory will maintain a 
study subject log which will be monitored by the Sponsor for accuracy. Samples will be processed 
according to approved laboratory protocols and testing will be conducted on the samples per 
standard operating procedures. Samples will remain at the laboratory for the duration of the study.  
12.1. Retention of study cytology samples  
Consistent with the informed  consent  received from each Subject , study cytology sample s will be 
retained by the Sponsor . The sample  will be coded and de -identified.   
12.2. Results reporting  
Cytology results will not be provided  to the study Subject or study Investigator so  as there is no 
impact in Subject care.  The study summary report will be shared with regulatory agencies  and 
Investigators at the end of the study.   
13. General Data Management Procedures  
Sponsor  will oversee all data management functions such as database development, user training , 
system maintenance, data queries, and report generation.   
13.1. Case Report Forms  
Sponsor  will use case report forms (CRFs) to collect subject  data. Training and instructions on 
completion of the CRFs  will be provided to the study site personnel.   
Data corrections made to CRFs will be recorded in a manner that ensures a complete audit trail .  
Changes are explained when needed  and are reviewed and approved by  the Investigator who 
signs and dates the CRF.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator and the study staff to complete the CRFs accurately and 
in a timely fashion. The Investigator will sign and date each CRF to verify that he /she  has 
reviewed the data.  
13.2. Source Documentation  
Investigators must maintain information in the study Subject ’s medical records to corroborate 
data collected on the CRFs  in order to ensure the validity of the study data collected .  The 
following t ypes of information should be maintained and made available as required by Sponsor  
and/or its designees. Medical (clinical and hospital) records may include the following 
documentation:    
• Medical history/physical condition of the Subject  before involvement in the study.  
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 20 of 21 • Signed notes in the Subject ’s medical record on the enrollment day that identify 
and include:  the Subject ’s date of enrollment, the study review , and 
documentation that the appropriate informed consent was obtained  
• Description of the procedure  
• Dated and signed notes for each Subject ’s study procedure  
• Lab results   
• Adverse event reporting and follow -up of any adverse events  
• Subject ’s condition upon completion of or withdrawal from the study  
Because of the potential for errors or inaccuracies in transcribing data into CRFs, source 
documentation must be maintained in each Subject’s medical  chart and/or electronic medical 
record. The CRFs and source documentation must be made available for inspection by the 
monitors , as designated by the Sponsor , or regulatory inspectors. Subject  files will be created a t 
the beginning of the study, maintained throughout the study and retained for two years after 
the latter of the following two dates: The dat e on which the investigation is terminated or 
completed , or the date that the records a re no longer needed to support a marketing application 
to the FDA . 
13.3. Data Queries  
During monitoring visits, the monitor will perform a review of CRF data  and source documents  
for all subject s. Data entry will be 100% source verified.   Discrepancies will be queried by the 
monitor or designee and should be resolved by the clinical site staff and Investigator in a timely 
manner. Queries also will be generated by Sponsor  data management personnel during routine 
review of the data.  
14. Monito ring 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to ensure that proper monitor ing of the study is conducted. 
Monitoring will be done by appropriately trained personnel appointed by the Sponsor to ensure that 
the study is conducted in accordance with Sponsor  requirements and applicable laws and regulations.  
14.1. Monitors  
A monitor is an individual designated by a sponsor or contract research organization to over see 
the progress of the study. The monitor in this study may be an employee of the S ponsor or a 
consultan t to the Sponsor, or an employee of or consultant to a contract research organization  
performing services on behalf of the Sponsor . The monitor will be trained on the device, clinical 
protocol, informed consent, applicable Sponsor  procedures, data system, and applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 21 of 21 14.2. Monitoring Visits  
During the course of the study, the Sponsor/monitor will be available to the Principal Investigator 
and site study staff to discuss any issues relevant to the study, and the Principal Inves tigator and 
site staff will make themselves available to the Sponsor for any relevant issues pertaining to the 
study.  The Sponsor, or Sponsor’s authorized representatives, will have access to all study files, 
including the administrative and regulatory files, Subject  binders and all source documentation 
for review to verify the accuracy and completeness of the records, as well as appropri ate Subject  
consent procedures.  Reports of monitoring visits will be provided to the clinical study personnel 
at each site.  Corrective action will be taken to resolve promptly any issues of noncompliance.     
Scheduled monitoring visits to the study site will occur at the following times:  prior to the 
initiation  of the study ( i.e. site qualification visit ), interim monitoring visits throughout the study, 
and upon c ompletion of the study  (i.e. study close -out).

5.1 –Overall Design
5.5.1 – Starting Do se 
for this Trial
5.5.1.3 – Dose in Mini 
Age Cohort 3 and

Cohorts 1, 2, and 3
7.1 – Treatments

10.6.2 –Modeling and 
Simulation for Dose 
Selection
10.10 – Subgroup 
Analy sesThe text was updated to include the use 
of weight bands ( which will be 
determined based on PK anal yses) for 
dose recommendations in Mini Age 
Cohort 3 and the Expanded Age 
Cohorts. In Section 10.10, weight 
bands ha vebeen added as a category  of 
subgroup anal yses.Added to improve the precision of pediatric dosing
recommendations made by  the study .
9.3.7 –Events of 
Clinical I nterest (ECI)The following revisions were made to 
liver-related ECIs:
In ECI #2, “from the initiation of 
study  therapy ” was replaced with 
“after initiation of study  therapy ”
In ECI #3, “ 3X ULN from the 
initiation of study  therapy ” was 
replaced with “ 100 IU/L after
initiation of study  therapy ”An ALT/AST threshold of >100 IU/L is a clinically  meaningful 
threshold for evaluation of potential drug induced liver toxicity  for 
pediatric participa nts. Using a numerical trigger for evaluation 
rather than fold ULN, ensures a uniform approach to evaluation of 
ALT and AST elevations. Use of the word “after” rather than 
“from initiation” ensures that the elevation being captured occurs 
after Day  1 of therap y.

Other Changes
2 –Schedule of 
Activities (SoA)Removed heart rate and blood pressure 
as examples of vital signs that will be 
collected from the first column of the 
table .These were removed to clarify  that comprehensive vital sign data 
will be collected, not just heart rate and blood pressure.   Vital signs 
being collected were added to the “ Notes ” column .
3.3 –Benefit/Risk 
AssessmentDetails of study  procedures to monitor 
for elevations in alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) were added.Revisions made to allow investigators to more easily  identify  the 
benefit/risks to the participant and the protocol -defined procedures 
in place for monitoring potential risks
5.1 –Overall Design Enrollment requirements for the mini 
and expanded age cohorts were 
removed from the text and summarized 
in a table.Presentation of enrollment requirements revised to improve 
readabilit y of section.
5.1.1 –Study  Diagram The diagram was updated to be 
consistent with Table 2.Consistent with the enrollment requirements for each Age Cohort 
in Table 2.
5.4.2.3.2 –Late ALT 
Elevations and 
Hepatic ECI Resulting 
in a Pause in 
Enrollment
8.1 –Discontinuation 
of Study  TreatmentBulleted criterion in each section was 
revised to remove “Grade 4 laboratory  
abnormality ”.Grading of adverse events (AE), including laboratory  AEs, are 
reported b y the investigator as mild, moderate ,
or severe as 
describe d in Section 9.3 of the protocol and not as a numerical 
scoring s ystem. An y Grade 4 event w ould be reported by  this

6.1 – Inclusion 
CriteriaInclusion criterion #5 (a) (iii) was 
revised to add that absence of cirrhosis 
can be determined b y local clinical 
standards during screening as assessed 
by the investigator.This change was made to clarify  that absence of cirrhosis can be 
determined b y local clinical standards that includes phy sical 
examination during screening in combination with laboratory  
evaluation during screening and/or imaging test within 6 months of 
screening, as assessed b y the investigator.
Inclusion criterion #5 ( b) (iii) was 
revised to add that cirrhosis can be 
determined b y local clinical standards 
during screening as assessed by  the 
investigator.This change was made to clarify  that the presence of cirrhosis can 
be determined b y local clinical standards that includes phy sical 
examination during screening in combination with laboratory  
evaluation and/or imaging test as assessed b y the investigator.
The following note was removed from 
inclusion criterion #5: Computed 
tomograph y or magnetic resonance 
imaging obtained as part of clinical 
care may  be used in place of 
ultrasound, if available.This change was made to remove an errant note from inclusion 
criterion #5.
The term “legally  acceptable 
representative” in inclusion criterion 
#10 was revised to “legally  acceptable 
representative(s)”.This change was made to address potential site-specific 
requirements that both parents need to sign the informed consent 
before the child can participate in a clinical trial.

6.2 –Exclusion 
Criteria1. A note was added to criterion #2 to 
specify  use of +1 for the bilirubin 
category of the Child -Pugh calculation 
for participants with Gilbert’s 
syndrome.
2. Criterion #7c was updated to specify  
that participants with “uncontrolled” 
celiac sprue disease are excluded.
3. “Failure to thrive” was added to the 
list of excluded medical conditions in 
criterion #7 e.1. Added to improve clarity  of the protocol; mild bilirubin 
elevations are found in patients with Gilbert’s sy ndrome, which is 
common and not reflective of an underl ying advanced liver 
disease.
2. Wording refined as patients with controlled disease do not have 
malabsorption.
3. This change was made to provide an additional medical 
exclusion of children with an unusually  low weight that might 
impact PK.

AdministeredA statement was added to specify  that, 
following assignment of formulation, 
participants may  not change from FDC 
tablets to pediatric formulation or from 
pediatric formulation to FDC tablets.Added to improve clarit yof the protocol . 
The description of the pediatric formula 
single entity packet was updated to 
clarify  that the Sponsor’s product 
number (MK -8742 for EBR and MK -
5172 for GZR) will be included on the 
label.This change was made to clarify  that MK -8742 represents EBR 
and MK -5172 represents GZR on the label.
7.7 –Concomitant 
Therap y1. The table containing prohibited 
medications was updated to reflect that 
all statins are prohibited during the 
dosing period of the study.
2. Text that repeated a prohibit ed 
medication (“modafinil”) was deleted 
from the table. 1. Statins are excluded in order to minimize the number of 
variables that impact the PK of EBR/GZR .
2. Redundant content removed.
“Including but not limited to” was 
added to the list of prohibited strong 
CYP3A inhibitors by  participants in the 
Mini Age Cohorts. To improve clarit y of the protocol.
8.1 – Discontinuation 
of Study  TreatmentRepeated bullet has been deleted. Redundant content removed.
9.1.12 –Calibration of 
EquipmentRemoval of text referring to critical 
equipment.Textual revisions were applied to clarify  investigator responsibility  
for calibration and maintenance of trial equipment.

9.6.1 –Blood 
Collection for Plasma 
EBR/GZR1. Instructions were added for 
participants receiving pediatric 
formulation to record the following 
information in the Study  Medication 
and Meal Diary  (SMD) for all doses: 
a)the soft food that EBR/GZR granules 
were mixed into and b) the pediatric 
formulation food consumption 
timeframe (ie, the time from mixing of 
medication into the soft food vehicle to 
complete consumption of all granules 
that were mixed into the soft food).
Sites should also enter this information 
into the eCRF.
2. The tex t was revised to clarify  that 
meal data entry  for the pre -dose PK 
sample on Day 1 is not required. 
3. The timing for recording meal data 
on the day  prior to the predose PK visit 
and on the day  of the visit was updated.1. Soft food vehicle information may be considered as part of the 
PK analy sesin order to ascertain whether the t ype of food vehicle 
or the duration pediatric granules are dispersed within the food 
vehicle impact PK.
2. To improve clarit y of the protocol.
3. The timeframe for collection of meal data around the dose was 
revised to represent the timeframe for which meals can impact PK 
results .
9.11.1 –Screening An abnormal FibroScan result at 
Screening was deleted as an 
exclusionary  criterion that could be 
retestedThis change was made to correct an error.  Abnormal FibroScan 
results at screening may  not be repeated.

9.11.2 – Treatment 
Period1. The description of the packaging of 
open -label EBR/GZR FDC tablets was 
revised. “Blister card(s)” was replaced 
with “container(s)”.
2.A reference to the soft food 
information to be recorded in the SMD 
for participants on EBR/GZR pediatric 
formulation was added.1. The final packaging may  be in the form of “blister cards” or 
“bottles” depending on geographic region.  Therefore, the word 
“container” is inclusive for all packaging t ypes.
2. Consistent with the soft food information instructions for the 
SMD added to Section 9.6.1.
9.11.4 –Discontinued 
Participants Continued 
to be Monitored in the 
StudyParticipants who have met virologic 
failure criteria will also need to be 
identified as having a treatment-
emergent resistance associated 
substitution in order to be eligible fo r 
follow -up in protocol MK-5172 -017Updated to clearl y define participants who require additional 
follow -up to asses s persistence of resistance following DAA 
therap y.
10.4.1.1 –
Pharmacokinetic 
EndpointsIncluded statement that the meal and 
soft food vehicle information may  be 
considered in PK analy ses.This statement was added to improve clarit y of the protocol 
regarding the purpose of meal and soft food information collection 
in this study .

Confidential3.Introduction
MK- 5172 is a fixed dose combination (FDC) of elbasvir (EBR:  an NS5A inhibitor) and 
grazoprevir (GZR:  an NS3/4A protease inhibitor) which has been approved for the treatment 
of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults .
Study Rationale 3.1
The purpose of this protocol is to assess pharmacokinetics ( PK), safety ,and efficacy  of EBR 
and GZR in a population of pediatric HCV -infected participants aged 3 y ears up to 18 y ears. 
These data will be used to support dosing recommendations in the pedia tric population.
EBR/GZR with and without ribavirin (RBV) has been developed and approved for adults 
with chronic hepatitis C genotyp e (GT) 1or 4. Diverse adult populations have been studied 
including those with cirrhosis, human immunodeficiency  virus type 1 (HIV-1) co-infection, 
end stage renal disease, and prior treatment failure. Efficacy  rates exceed 90% regardless of 
these underl ying co -morbidities or patient characteristics. 
Historically , children treated for HCV have had similar response rates as adults when given a 
similar regimen at the appropriate dose . The adult EBR/GZR PK model is highl y predictive 
of clinical response (safety  and efficacy  in adults). Therefore pediatric patients are 
anticipated to have a similar safet y and efficacy  prof ile when given doses that achieve a 
similar exposure as that seen in adult patients . Theintensive PK obtained at Treatment Week 
(TW) 4 will be used to update the adult population PK model tosupport dosing 
recommendations in the pediatric population. 
Background 3.2
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background 
information including preclinical and clinical trial data for EBR/GZR .
Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 3.2.1
MK- 5172 is comprised of the following 2 direct -acting antiviral (DAA) HCV agents:
EBR (elbasvir, MK -8742) is an HCV NS5A inhibitor .
GZR (grazoprevir, MK -5172) is an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor.
Each MK -5172 FDC tablet contains EBR (50 mg) and GZR (100 mg) and is administered 
once dail y(QD) .  Particip ants in Mini Age Cohort 1 (oldest Age Cohort) will receive t he 
FDC tablet .  This will also apply  to participants in Expanded Age Cohort 1 if it is determined 
by PK analy sis that Expanded Age Cohort 1 will also receive the adult FDC dose .  The two 
younger a ge cohorts will receive EBR p ediatric formulation and GZR pediatric formulation .  
See Section 7.1 for a description and dosing instructions of the EBR/GZR pediatric 
formulation .

ConfidentialOverview 3.2.1.1
Children with chronic hepatitis C are vulnerable to the same long-term health consequences 
as adults, including progressive liver damage, cirrhosis ,and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) . 
Developing an age appropriate, all -oral, well tolerated, short duration treatment regimen for 
HCV infected children is highl y desir able for a population that is currently  restricted to the 
current pediatric standard of care, pegy lated -interferon with RBV (PR) . In contrast to the 
current safe and convenient therapies available to adults, PR most commonly  requires 48 
weeks of therapy, with weekl y injections . The therap y has man y adverse events (AEs) ,
including flu- like s ymptoms , anemia ,andimpairment of growth , while achieving a sustained 
virologic response ( SVR )of only  ~50%.
Epidemiology of Chronic Hepatitis C
Worldwide it is estimated that 3 to 4 million people are newl y infected with HCV annuall y 
and 170 million are chronically  infected [Hanafiah, K. M., et al 2013] . For those who are 
chronicall y infected, there is a lifetime risk of developing progressive liver damage, cirrhosis ,
and liver cancer. In the United States (US), approximately  2.2 to 3.2 million persons are 
estimated to have chronic HCV infection based on a national survey of the civilian, non -
instituti onalized population [Denniston, M. M., et al 2014] .
Of the patients infected with HCV, many  are children.  S eroprevalence data for children aged 
1 to 15 y ears in the US and in Western Europe are 0.6% and 0.8-1.3% , respectivel y. The 
prevalence is similar to the 20 -30 year old population in each of these regions [Hanafiah, K. 
M., et al 2013] . Most studies that have investigated the ser oprevalence of HCV in childhoo d
fail to i nvestigate whether HCV antibody -positive children are also HCV viremic. 
Extrapolating from adult studies, it is estimated that approximately 50 -80% of those with 
positive HCV antibody  are chronicall y infected and viremic [Aach, R. D., et al 2000] [Vogt, 
M., et al 1999] .
Modes of Transmission of HCV in Pediatrics :  Vertical transmission of HCV infection is the 
most common route of acquiring HCV infection in infants and chi ldren. In the US, there are 
approximately  7500 new cases per y ear from vertical transmission [Mack, C. L ., et al 2012] .
Mother to child transmission among HCV mono -infected women is approximately  5%. 
Although the risk is low for an individual, HCV infection is common ,and thus accounting 
for a significant number of new infections in newborns annuall y. Among HIV -1/HCV co -
infected women, vertical transmission can be as high as 25%. Other modes of transmission 
in pediatrics, include household contacts and most importantly , especially  among 
adolescents, acquisition due to high risk behaviors such as injection drug use, tattoos ,and 
piercings.  For children younger than the age of 3 years, results from a prospecti ve study  
following a birth cohort have shown that 17% had spontaneous viral clearance b y age 2 and 
24% had clearance b y age 3 [England, K., et al 2005] [Narkewicz, M. R., et al 2007] . It is 
because of th is earl y predilection for spontaneous clearance that treatment trial s for children 
with chronic HCV do not include the age group from birth to age 3 years.
Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis C
The therapeutic goal of treatment of hepatitis C is the eradication of the virus with a halt in 
the progression of liver damage. Similarities in the treatment response characteristics of

Confidentialchronic HCVin adult and pediatric populations support the premise t hat therapeutic advances 
demonstrated in adults will likely  be applicable to children. Historicall y, children have 
benefited from a similar approach to treatment of chronic HCV as adults [Kelly , D. A., et al 
2011] [Wirth, S., et al 2010] . As of 2017 , high efficacy  was observed in a Phase IItrial and 
supported approval in children aged 12 to 18 of an all-oral DAA regimen of
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir [Balistreri, W. F., et al 2016] . The observed efficacy  in the pediatric 
population in this study  was similar to that seen among adults treated with the same regimen . 
Children should benefit from the new generation of HCV treatments that are all oral, safe ,
and effect ive. These advances are substantial improvements compared to the curren t
standard of care for children ,which is 24 to 48 weeks of PR.
It is anticipated that EBR/GZR dosed to provide the same PK exposures achieved in the adult 
population will be aneffect ive and safe pediatric HCV therap yfor GT1 and GT4 infection, 
as indicated in adults .

the regional variability  in availability  of commercial RAS testing. In the US ,the addition of 
RBV and lengthening the treatment duration to 16 weeks arerecommended for the small

to both the EU and US prescribing information), only  participants with HCV GT1 or with 
GT4 and HCV ribonucleic acid ( RNA )800,000 IU/mL  will be enrolled. In addition, for

ConfidentialPK Background and Strategy 3.2.3
In the Phase II/IIIEBR/GZR development program, population PK, PK/ pharmacod ynamics 
(PD),and physiologically  based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK )modeling supported the proper 
dosing for a safe and efficacious adult regimen . The PK/PD modeling for safety and efficacy 
were used to define the clinical comparability bounds, based on an area under the time-
concentration curve ( AUC )of [0.4, 5.0] for GZR and [0.5, 2.0] for EBR. Application of 
these models and clinical bounds will be applied to thispediatric trialto support dosing of 
children aged 3 years up to 18 years.
EBR/GZR Metabolism 3.2.3.1
EBRelimination in humans is via a combination of excretion of parent compound as well as 
oxidative metabolism (mediated via cytochrome P4503A [CYP3A ]) into feces, with minimal 
elimination into urine. EBR is a substrate of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein ( P-gp)(minor 
contribution). EBRexhibits linear and dose -proportional PK across the 10 -100 mg dose 
range. HCV patients and healthy participants receiving 50 -100 mg QD have comparable 
plasma exposures at steady -state. Following administration of EBR 50 mg QD to HCV 
patients, the geometric mean (GM) apparent terminal half -life is ~24 hours and steady- state 
is achieved within 5 days. EBRexhibits moderate bioavailability  (32%), with a time to 
maximum concentration ( Tmax)of ~3 hours. 
GZRis eliminated via biliary  excretion in the form of oxidative metabolism (mediated via 
CYP3A4) and as GZR (likely  via biliary  efflux transport) in humans. GZRis a substrate of 
CYP3A4, P -gp (minor contribution), and the liver uptake transporters organic a nion-
transporting pol ypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1/3. G ZRhas non -linear and greater than dose -
proportional plasma PKin humans, likely  attributed to saturation of CYP3A metabolism and 
OATP1B uptake at higher doses/exposures. Steady -state GZR plasma PK is ~2 -fold greater 
in HCV patients than in healthy  participants . Following administration of GZR 100mg QD 
to HCV patients, the GMapparent terminal half -life is ~31 hours. In HCV patients, the HCV 
viral load decline associated with the first few weeks of administr ation of EBR/ GZR results 
in decreased GZR exposure (likel y due to improved liver function); therefore, stead y-state in 
patients is achieved b y about TW4.GZRexhibits moderate bioavailability (10 -40%), with a 
Tmaxof ~2 hours.
Modeling and Simulation in Adults 3.2.3.2
Population PK, PK/PD, and PBPK models have been developed for EBR and GZR in support 
of the adult filings .
GZR is associated with exposure -dependent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) elevations that ty pically  occuraround TW8-10.  The efficacy  
endpoint for EBR and GZR of SVR 12is also exposure -dependent.  Logistic regression 
PK/PD models for safet y and efficacy have been established using adult data.  During PK/PD 
model development, AUC was found to be the most pre dictive PK parameter for both safet y 
and efficacy .  Using the PK/PD models, the therapeutic bounds, based on AUC, were defined 
for EBR [0.5, 2.0] and GZR [0.4, 5.0].

ConfidentialBased on the EBR and GZR population PK models (N=3214 total patients and health y 
partici pants ), the impact of various intrinsic factors on the plasma PK of EBR and GZR were 
determined and are demonstrated in the forest plot in Figure 1. Several intrinsic factors 
affected EBR and/or GZR PK, but most changes were within the clinical comparability
bounds ,and therefore not clinically  relevant. For example, low body  weight (~37-66 kg) had 
an~20% increase in AUC for both EBR and GZR, but the increase was well within the 
therapeutic window for both compounds. EBR/GZR are contraindicate d in patients with 
Child -Pugh B and C cirrhosis.
PBPK models for EBR and GZR were previousl y developed, which incorporated the key  
absorption, distribution , metabolism, and excretion ( ADME )and PKproperties for both 
compounds ( eg, OATP1B saturation for GZR) [M&S Anal ysis Rpt 2015] [M&S Analy sis Rpt 
2015] . This modeling provided supportive mechanistic evidence and interpretation for the 
effect of intrinsic factors ( eg, HCV infection, cirrhosis, Asian ethnicity ) on the PKof EBR 
and GZR.
These data and models supported the approval of EBR/GZR in adults infected with HCV 
GT1 and/or 4 and will be updated and used to select appropriate doses for the pediatric 
population.

ConfidentialPreclinical Trials Supporting a Pediatric Clinical Study 3.2.4
Prior to initiation of the pediatric clinical trial, pre -and postnatal developmental EBR and 
GZR monotherap y studies have been conducted and have not identified findings of concern 
in rats, rabbits ,and dogs. In rats, dosing did not result in any  effects on development, 
growth, behavior, reproductive performance, or fertility  following oral administration to 
female rats from Gestation Day  6 through Lactation Day  20. In these studies, the highest 
maternal GZR exposure, area under the time -concentration cu rve over 24 hours ( AUC 0-24)= 
155 μM•hr represents approximately  31-fold the GZR clinical target AUC 0-24of 5 μ M•hr in 
humans, and the highest maternal EBR exposure, AUC 0-24= 21.8 μM•hr (measured in 
pregnant females in the embry ofetal developmental and toxicokinetic [TK] study  in ra ts) 
represents approximately 16 -fold the EBR clinical target AUC 0-24of 1.35 μM•hr in humans. 
Additionally , EBR and GZR placental and lactational transfe r studies in rats and EBR and 
GZR placental transfer studies in rabbits showed distribution of EBR or G ZR into rat and 
rabbit fetal plasma and rat milk. TK parameters obtained at different animal ages in the 
repeat -dose EBR and GZR monotherapy studies in rats and dogs did not indicate age -related 
differences in plasma s ystemic exposures. In rats, the first TK evaluation was performed in 
7-week old animals (which corresponds to an approximat e human age of 12 years), and the 
last TK evaluation was performed in 18 -week old animals (adult animals). In dogs, the first 
TK evaluation was performed in 26 -(EBR) or 32 -week old (GZR) animals (which 
corresponds to an approximat e human age of 15 -17 years), and the last TK evaluation was 
performed in 56 -(EBR) or 78 -week old (GZR) animals (adult animals). 
In conclusion, pre -clinical animal studies support the use of EBR and GZR in children.
Benefit/Risk Assessment 3.3
It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical trials will directly benefit from treatment 
durin g participation, as clinical trials are designed to provide information about the safet y 
and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.
Elbasvir/Grazoprevir
In Phase I- IIIstudies, 1,234 healthy  volunteers, 66 non -HCV -infected persons with liver or 
kidney impairment, and 2,704 HCV -infected participants have been treated with any  dose or 
regimen of EBR and/or GZR, with or without RBV. At a dose of E BR (50 mg) and GZR 
(100 mg), high efficacy  and a favorable safet y profile have been demonstrated in 
approxi mately  2,000 participants, including participants with cirrhosis, HIV-1/HCV -
coinfection, chronic kidney  disease, and history  of prior HCV treatment failure.
ALT elevation is a safet y signal associated with increased GZR exposures.  Because of this, a 
plan has been developed to monitor for the signal.  This protocol includes predefined 
monitoring of Events of Clinical I nterest (ECI) (Section 9.3.7), specification of ALT levels 
that would require discontinuation of study  treatment (Section 8.1), and predefined criteria 
for late ALT elevations and hepatic ECI which will result in a pause in enrollment 
(Section 5 .4.2.3.2 ).

The goals of this Phase II b trial are: 1) to define doses for EBR/GZR in children by 
assessing plasma PK concentrations that target a similar PK to that seen in adult sreceiving 
EBR 50 mg and GZR 100 mg. The PK target has been defined b y the clinical PK 
comparability  bounds, within which there were no clinically important differences for safet y 
and efficacy ;2) to establish the tolerability , safet y,and efficacy  of the combination therapy  
in the pediatric HCV -infected population.   All participants will receive EBR/GZR without 
RBV for 12 week s.
The trialwill enroll participants into three Age Cohorts :

will be used for Mini Age Cohort 3 and the Expanded Age Cohor ts.Weight bands will 
be determined based on the PK anal yses.
Following the conclusion of this study  and the Clinical Study  Report ( CSR) for the stud y, a
final PK model will be developed that includes all PK data from participants aged 3 years up 
to 18 years, in addition to relevant adult data previously  collected in the program.  The final 
model and proposed pediatric dosing regimen will be summarized in a separate report.
PK samples will be collected in all pediatric participants according to the sampl ing scheme in 
Table 
9.  At Day  1 (Mini Age Cohort 1 only) and TW4(all participants), an overnight stay  is 
recommended 
to obtain PK samples over a 24- hour period (intensive PK).
In order to reduce PK variability , enrollment in the Mini Age Cohorts will be limited to 
noncirrhotic participants of non- Asian Race who are not currently  taking methadone or 
strong CYP3A inhibitors.  The Mini Age Cohorts will also exclude participants below a 
weight as described in the inclusion/exclusion criteria; the Expanded Age Cohorts will enroll 
a broader population as described in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Specific procedures to be performed during the trial, as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the Trial SoA - Section 2. De tails of each procedure 
are provided in Section 9 –Study  Assessments and Procedures.

ConfidentialScientific Rationale for Study Design 5.4
Rationale for Study Population 5.4.1
Participants in this trialwill include noncirrhotic or compensated cirrhotic pediatric 
participants who are either TN or PR -TEandinfected wit h HCV GT1b/1 -other ;or with HCV 
GT1a without a baseline NS5A RAS at position 28, 30, 31 ,and/or 93 ;or TN and infected 
with GT4 and HCV RNA 800,000 IU/mL ;and who meet other inclusion/exclusion criteria 
as described in Section 6.  Because PK exposure is independent of GT, the information 
obtained and doses proposed in this trial can be extrapolated to other GTs for final dosing 
and administration guidance . The final administration recommendations with regards to 
duration and need for RBV will be similar to the adult recommendations. Children enrolled 
in this trialwill all be eligible for a 12-week RBV -free regimen , ie,this trialwill enroll 
participants who are HCV GT1b/1 -other ;HCV GT1a without a baseline NS5A RAS at 
position 28, 30, 3 1, and/or 93 ; or are HCV GT4 with HCV RNA 800,000 IU/mL . 
Rationale for Endpoints 5.4.2
Efficacy Endpoints 5.4.2.1
The measurement for efficacy  in this trialis the plasma HCV RNA level.  Long -term 
suppression of HCV RNA, ty pically  reported as SVR , has been associated with improved 
outcomes in subjects with chronic hepatitis C infection as measured b y biochemical and 
histological remission of liver disease.  Most available data suggest that SVR following 
antiviral therap y reduces the risk of progre ssion to cirrhosis and may  prevent the 
development of severe liver complications and improve survival [Alberti, A. 2011] .
The evaluation of efficacy in this trialis based on SVR 12, the same endpoint used for al l 
investigational and approved DAAs.  Since a high degree of concordance has been observed 
between SVR 12and SVR 24[Martinot -Peignoux, M., et al 2010] , SVR 12is used as the primary 
endpoint for registration of D AAs.  For this trial, an evaluation of efficacy  based on SVR 24
will be an exploratory  analy sis[Chen, J., et al 2013] .
Measurement of HCV RNA 5.4.2.1.1
HCV RNA plasma levels will be measured using the Roche COBAS®AmpliPrep/COBAS®
TaqMan®HCV Test, v2.0 on blood samples drawn from each participant at various time 
points prior to, during, and after dosing, as indicated in the SoA (Section 2).  
They  are also used to identify  particip antswho meet HCV virologic failu re criteria.   HCV 
RNA levels are described as detailed in Table 3.

ConfidentialDefinition of Efficacy Endpoints
Efficacy  will be defined at different timepoints during the trial. Specific endpoints are:
SVR 12:  Participant has HCV RNA <LLOQ (either TD[u]or TND )12 weeks after the 
end of all study  therapy .
SVR 24:Participant has HCV RNA < LLOQ (either TD [u]or TND )24 weeks after the 
end of all study  therapy .
Definition of Virologic Failure
Lack of efficacy  at different timepoints in the trial will be categorized as:
Non- response :  Participant has HCV RNA detected at end of treatment without HCV 
RNA <LLOQ having been achieved while on treatment (note that breakthrough is 
captured below ).
Rebound :  Participant has a rebound defined as >1 log 10IU/mL increase in HCV RNA 
from nadir while on treatment and confirmed from a separate blood draw within 2 weeks.
Virologic breakthrough :  Participant has a confirmed HCV RNA ≥LLOQ (TD[q]) after 
being <LLOQ previously while on treatment . Confirmation is defined as an HCV RNA 
≥LLOQ from a separate blood draw repeated within 2 weeks.
Relapse :  Participant has a confirmed HCV RNA ≥LLOQ (TD[q]) following end of all 
study  therapy , after becoming undetectable (TND) at end of treatment. Confirma tion is 
defined as an HCV RNA ≥LLOQ from a separate blood draw repeated within 2 weeks.
Viral Resistance Measurements 5.4.2.1.2
In this trial, RASs are defined as specific genetic substitution sthat generate viral proteins 
that maintain function, but have reduced susceptibility to a DAA. As the presence of certain 
HCV RASs can lead to treatment failure, they  are one of the most important considerations 
when treating with a DAA. Those genetic substit utions that impact efficacy outcomes may  
be present at baseline ( ie, prior to therap y), or they may be treatment- emergent ( ie, not 
detected at baseline, but which emerge and are selected over the course of therap y).
Blood samples for viral resistance assay s are collected at:
Screening : Testing will be done to assess for the presence of NS5A and NS3 RA Ss that 
have been associated with reduced efficacy for NS5A compounds ( eg,ledipasvir, 
daclatasvir, EBR) or protease inhibitors ( eg,simeprevir, boceprevir, telaprevir , GZR ). In
GT1a -infected participants , presence of NS5A RA Sat amino acid position 28, 30, 31 ,
and/or 93 will be used for enrollment criteria as outlined in inclusion/exclusion .
Virologic failure and/or selected follow -up visits :  To better under stand the emergence 
and natural history  of RA Ss in association with virologic failure, samples will be 
obtained at virologic failure confirmation visits, Follow -up Week (FW) 4, FW12, and 
FW24.  RASswill be assessed for an y participant who has detectable virus above
1000 IU/mL  and has met an HCV virologic failure criteria.  Blood samples for resistance 
testing are also collected at all visits following confirmation of virologic failure to the end

Confidentialof the trial .  To limit the risk of RA Ss,participants are not allowed to have monotherap y 
with EBR or GZR in this protocol.
Participants who have met virologic failure criteria, will be offered follow -up in a 3 -year 
long-term follow -up protocol, MK -5172 Protocol 017, to determine the persistence of RASs 
and to determine time course of reversion to wild -type.
Palatability and Accepta nceAssessment Endpoint 5.4.2.2
Adherence to treatment for chronic HCV infection is necessary for participants to achieve 
SVR .  Palatability may play  an important role in adhe rence to HCV treatment in the pediatric 
population .  Palatability  is an important element in the determination of acceptability , and 
encompasses a product’s smell, taste, aftertaste, and texture. Acceptability , including 
palatability , of EBR/GZR will be assessed in all participants using the Palatability  
Acceptance Assessment (PAA) .  In previous studies, t he most commonly  reported 
assessment measured palatability  preference using a visual analog scale that was modified by 
including a facial hedonic scale (FHS; facial expression scale depictin g various degrees of 
pleasure) [Thompson, C., et al 2015] . The five- point FHS for taste is one of the most 
frequentl y reported t ypesof palatability assessments used in ped iatric clinical trial s.
Safety Endpoints 5.4.2.3
General Safety 5.4.2.3.1
The safet y and tolerability of EBR in combination with GZR are assessed by a clinical 
evaluation of AEs and inspection of other stud y parameters including vital signs, ph ysical 
examinations, and stand ard laboratory  safet y tests at appropriate time points as specified in 
the SoA.  Adverse events are graded and recorded according toSection 9.3 .  Participants may 
be asked to return for unscheduled visits in order to perform additional safety monitoring.
Late ALT Elevations and Hepatic ECI Resulting in a Pause in Enrollment 5.4.2.3.2
As discussed in Section 3.2.3.2 ,ALT elevation is a safet y signal associated with increased 
GZR exposures. In this trial, it is expected that the safet y profile should match adults. 
Therefore, safet y of an Age Cohort will be based on the following criteria.
If≥3 participants receiving a given EBR/GZR dose in an Age Cohort experience any  of the 
following, allocatio n of new participants into the Age Cohort will be paused. Participants
that are tolerating treatment with that study  drug combination may  continue to receive stud y 
therap y, but no additional participants will be enrolled until the Sponsor has reviewed all 
safet y and PK data of participants receiving the drug combination.
ALTor AST increases to >500 IU/L and is confirmed with repeat test immediatel y.
ALT or AST increases to 3×baseline and/or nadir , is >100 IU/L, and there is a 
simultaneous increase in total bilirubin >2 ×upper limit of normal ( ULN)and/or 
international normalized ratio ( INR)is increased from the baseline value and is >1.5 
(unless the participant is on anticoagulation).

simultaneous increase in total bilirubin >2 ×ULN and/or INR is increased from the 
baseline value and is >1.5 (unless the participant is on anticoagulation).
The participant’s alkaline phosphatase increases to >3 ×ULN, there is a simultaneous 
increase in total bilirubin >2 ×ULN and other causes of elevated alkal ine phosphatase are 
excluded.
The participant’s alkaline phosphatase increases to >5 ×ULN and other causes of 
elevated alkaline phosphatase are excluded .
The participant has a life -threatening clinical or laboratory  AEor an AEthat results in or 
prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization, or death, that is assessed to be study drug -
related.
In the event this pause criterion is met, the eDMC will be notified and enrollment into the 
Age Cohort will be paused and PK -PD anal ysis will be performed to re -assess and identify  
an appropriate safet y boundary  for the pediatric population.
Growth 5.4.2.3.3
Growth assessments will include height and weight measurements of each participant
outlined inthe SoA. The height of both biological parents will be obtained to determine the 
participant’s growth potential.   The participant may continue in the study  without these data 
and/or consent to obtain, use, and disclose parental personal data .
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 5.4.2.4
The primary  PK endpoints for GZ R and EBR are steady -state plasma AUC 0-24, Cmax, Ctrough, 
and CL/F. Additional steady -state PK parameters such as plasm a concentration immediately  
predose (C trough)andTmaxwill also be estimated.
Future Biomedical Research 5.4.2.5
The Sponsor will conduct Future Biomedical Research on specimens consented for future 
biomedical research during this clinical trial.  This research may  include genetic analy ses 
(DNA), gene expression profiling (RNA), proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasma) and/or 
the measurement of other anal ytes, depending on which specimens are consented for future 
biomedical research.
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main trial) and will only be conduct ed on specimens from 
appropriatel y consented participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for 
Future Biomedical Research is to explore and identify  biomarkers that inform the scientific 
understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic tr eatments. The overarching goal is to use 
such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that 
participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time.  The 
details of this Future Biomedical R esearch sub -trial are presented in Appendix 6   –

ConfidentialRationale for theUse of Comparator/Placebo 5.4.3
This is an open -label trial of the safet y and efficacy  of the combination of EBR and GZR.
The current pediatric standard of care is P R. Comparisons will be made to historic efficacy  
rates and safet y profile in pediatric PRclinical trials [Kelly , D. A., et al 2011] [Wirth, S., et 
al 2010 ] [McHutchison, J. G., et al 2009] .
As discussed in S ection 3.2.2.1, the response rates for HCV in children are comparable to 
response rates in adults. With an all -oral DAA regimen, the medications directly interact 
with the virus and are not impacted significantly  by host response. This is most clearl y 
demonstrated b y the minimal impact of race, gender, and IL28B status on efficacy of 
EBR/GZR in the adult program (see IB). Safety  profile will be established without a 
comparator. PRhasa well charac terized safet y profile in both adults and children. 
Justification for Dose 5.5
Starting Dose for This Trial 5.5.1
Mini Age Cohort 1 (aged 12 to less than 18 years)will start with the adult FDC EBR/GZR 
(50mg/100 mg) dose.   Mini Age Cohort 2 (aged 7 to less than 12 y ears) is planned to start 
with the pediatric formulation of EBR/GZR (30 mg/60 mg).  Based on the PK analys es from 
Mini Age Cohort 1 and 2 , dosing recommendations will be provided by  weight bands for 
Mini Age Cohor t 3 and Expanded Age Cohort 1.   Similarly , as described below, dosing 
regimens for Expanded Age Cohorts 2/3 will be developed based on the population PK
model and dosing recommendations will be provided by weight bands .  Weight band sfor 
Mini Age Cohort 3 and the Expanded Age Cohorts will be determined b y PK anal yses. See 
Section 7.1 for a description of EBR/GZR adult FDC dose versus the pediatric formulation.
Dose Justifications 5.5.1.1
Since the relationship between exposure and safety and efficacy  is well -established for EBR 
and GZR in adults, achieving AUC exposures in pediatric patients that is similar to adults is 
anticipated to result in similar safet y and efficacy profile as adults. Therefore, the target dose 
in each pediatric age gr oup is one that y ields AUC exposures similar to that obtained in 
adults who receive EBR (50 mg) and GZR (100 mg). 
Similarity  between pediatric and adult AUC will be assessed based on the GM AUC values. 
The pediatric GM AUC should be approximately  within 2-fold that estimated in adults for 
EBR and GZR. Additionally , the pediatric GM AUC range should fall within the defined 
clinical bounds for EBR [0.5, 2.0] and GZR [0.4, 5.0]. Therefore, the pediatric GMAUC for 
each age group should fall within ~0.81 -8.6 µM*hr for GZR and ~1.1 -4.4 µM*hr for EBR, 
which corresponds to the AUC associated with the lower and upper clinical bounds. 
Otherwise, the dose will be adjusted for the Expanded Age C ohorts so that the AUC falls 
within the clinical bounds.
For EBR and GZR, CYP3A, P -gp, and OATP1B1/3 are the known enzy mes/transporters to 
consider when thinking about potential age -related PK changes in the pediatric population.  
Children >7 y ears of age have mature CYP3A enzymes that a re comparable to those of adults 
[Ince, I., et al 2013] , with minor incremental maturation of CYP3A in children 3- 7 yearsof

Confidentialage [Johnson, T. N., et al 2006] .  OATP1B 1 protein expression is not age dependent in the 
range of 9 day s to 12 years [Thomson, M. M., et al 2016] , or in the range of 7 to 70 years 
[Prasad, B., et al 2014] ,and OATP1B3 protein expression was also not age dependent in the 
range of 2 to 12 years [Thomson, M. M., et al 2016] . These observations indicate that 
minimal to no age -related changes related to enz yme/transpo rter expression or maturation for 
EBR and GZR are anticipated in the age range of 3 -18 years compared to adults.
Dose in Mini Age Cohort 1 and 2 5.5.1.2
The adult Phase II/IIIclinical program included patients with body  weight down to 37 kg, 
who demonstrated favorable PK, safet y, and efficacy. Based on the comparable bod y weight 
and CYP3A and OATP1B maturation in participants aged 12 y ears up to 18 y ears, 
participants in Mini Cohort 1 will be administered the adult FDC dose of EBR/ GZR (50 
mg/100 mg) , which is anticipated to result in comparable exposures to adults. 
The EBR and GZR PBPK models developed for the adult program were used to estimate 
exposures in pediatric HCV pat ients from 12 to 18 y ears of age .The pediatric simulations 
assumed the same OATP1B/3 factor for hepatic uptake as estimated for adult patients. The 
simCYPTMprogram used for the PBPK model accounts effects of ph ysiology  (eg, bod y 
weight, liver size) age -related CYP3A abundance, and HCV infection in these pediatric 
participants on PK.  The PBPK model suggests that the adult dose of EBR/ GZR (50 mg/ 100 
mg)would result in comparable plasma exposures in 12 -18 year olds as in adults.
The EBR and GZR PBPK mod els were also used to estimate exposures in pediatric HCV 
patients from 7 to 12 y ears of age. A dose of 30 mg and 60 mg for EBR and GZR , 
respectivel y, in pediatric HCV patients from 7 to 12 years of age is estimated to result in 
comparable AUC exposures a s adult HCV patients that are administered the FDC. The 
starting dose for Mini Age Cohort 2 may  be refined, if needed, based on the estimated Day  1 
AUC from Mini Age Cohort 1.  
Dose in Mini Age Cohort 3 and Expanded Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 5.5.1.3
The doses in these cohorts will be determined based on cumulative pediatric PK data and 
population PK and PBPK modeling and simulation . The Day  1 and TW4 PK data from Mini 
Age Cohorts 1 and 2 will be used to estimate the AUC for these participants andwill be
incorpor ated in the population PK and PBPK models. 
The models willthen be used to estimate the anticipated exposure and select optimal doses 
forMini Age Cohort 3 and Expanded Age Cohort 1.  PK data from these cohorts will in turn 
be used to update the model, and select the dose for Expanded Age Cohort 2 /3.  Dosing 
recommendations for Mini Age Cohort 3 and the Expanded Age Cohorts will be provided by  
weight bands , which will be determined b y PK analyses. At each step, the goal of model -
based simulations will be to derive a dosing regimen expected to provide similar exposures in 
pediatric patients as in adults.  
Maximum Dose/Exposure for This Trial 5.5.2
The maximum dose in this trial will not exceed EBR 50 mg and GZR 100 mg .

Efficacy Assess ments 9.2
HCV RNA Measurements 9.2.1
Specimens must be obtained from all participants for the following HCV efficacy 
measurements:
HCV GTon baseline sample (for trial entry) using the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA )approved Abbott HCV Real Time Genot ype II assay which detects HCV GT 
1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 through the use of GT -specific fluorescent -labeled 
oligonucleotide probes in a real -time reverse transcription poly merase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) assay .  The RT -PCR reaction uses 3 sets of HCV specific amplification 
primers targeting the 5’ untranslated region (for all GTs) and NS5B regions from 
GT1a and 1b.  The assay  has accuracy  of >96% for GT1, 1a, 1b, 2, 3 and 5, 89% for 
GT5 and 83% for GT6 with 100% specifi city in HCV serologically  negative plasma 
samples.  Phy logenetic analy ses will be performed using sequences for NS3, NS5A, 
and NS5B regions to ensure accurate assignment of sample GT/subtype.
HCV RNA plasma levels at various time points per the SoA (Section 2).  HCV RNA 
in plasma will be measured using a COBAS®AmpliPrep/COBAS®Taqman®HCV 
Test, v2.0®assay  with a LLOQ of 15 IU/mL.  Results from the sample collected at 
the screening visit are used to determine eligibility.  Samples collected at other time 
points, after Day  1, are used for efficacy  analy ses and to identify  participants who 
meet virologic failure criteria. Leftover plasma may  be used for viral resistance 
testing if needed.
Viral Resistance Measurements 9.2.2
Specimens will be obtained from p articipants for HCV viral resistance measurements:
Blood will be drawn from all subjects at screening to assess viral resistance.
Viral resistance testing will be performed for all participants to determine pre -existing

Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Other Reportable Safety Events 9.3
The definitions of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE), as well as the 
method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting AE, SAE and other reportable safet y event rep orts can be 
found in Appendix 4.
AE, SAEs, and other reportable safety  events will be reported by  the participant (or, when 
appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally  authorized representative). 
The investigator, who is a qualifi ed ph ysician, and any  designees are responsible for 
detecting, assessing, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or 
SAE as well as other reportable safety events. Investigators remain responsible for following 
up AE, SAEs and other reportable safet y events for outcome according to Section 9.3.3.
Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE and Other Reportable 9.3.1
Safety Event Information 
All AEs, SAEs and other reportable safet y events that occur after the consent form is sig ned 
but before treatment allocation/randomization must be reported b y the investigator if the 
participant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in treatment, if the event cause the 
participant to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protoco l-specified intervention, 
including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therap y, diet, or a procedure. 
From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 14 day s following cessation of 
treatment, all AEs, SAEs and other reporta ble safety  events must be reported by  the 
investigator. 
Additionally , any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at an y time outside of the 
time period specified in the previous paragraph must be reported immediately to the Sponsor 
if the event i s considered to be drug -related.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AE or SAE or other reportable safet y events

ConfidentialMethod of Detecting AE, SAE and Other Reportable Safety Events 9.3.2
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE and other reportable 
safet y events. Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant (or, when 
appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant’s legall y acceptable representative) 
is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence .
Follow -up of AE, SAE and Other Reportable Safety Event Informat ion 9.3.3
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE, SAE and other reportable safet y events 
including pregnancy  and exposure during breastfeeding, ECI, Cancer and O verdose will be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). In addition, the investigator will 
make every  attempt to follow all non -serious AEs that occur in randomized participants for 
outcome.  Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4.
Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE 9.3.4
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by  the investigator to the sponsor of SAE is 
essential so tha t legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of 
participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and 
other re gulatory  agencies about the safet y of a study  treatment under clinical 
investigation. All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, I RB/IECs 
and investigators in accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations, ie,per 
ICH Topic E6 (R1) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigato rs as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will file 
it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify  the IRB/I EC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.

WOCBP.  For prepubescent females, site staff should continue to review and record, as 
appropriate, at each visit during the treatment period.
Contraception Confirmation 9.5.5
Throughout the screening and treatment periods, precaution must be taken to avoid 
pregnancy in WOCBP. Confirmation must be obtained and documented by  site personnel 
that WOCBP are using acceptable methods of contraception (see Appendix 5). This 
assessment must be documented in the participant's study  chart at each specified visit.
Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 9.5.6
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency. 
The investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this review, and record an y 
clinically  relevant changes occurring durin g the study in the AE section of the CRF. The 
laboratory  reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically  significant 
abnormal laboratory  findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing 
disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the 
participant's condition.
All protocol -required laboratory  assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA.
If laboratory  values from non -protocol specifi ed laboratory  assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory  require a change in study  participant management or are 
considered clinically  significant by  the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SL AB).
For an y laboratory  tests with values considered clinically  significantl y abnormal during 
participation in the study  or within 14 days after the last dose of stud y treatment, every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator. 
Fibroscan®9.5.6.1
This method for assessing liver cirrhosis has gained increasing acceptance. In the US, this 
methodology  is FDA -approved and in other countries, it is often the preferred method of 
assessment. FibroScan®results are influenced b y a number of confounders including ALT, 
ascites, and underly ing disease. Hepatitis C is one of the best studied and is the disease state 
with the most reproducible/reliable results. FibroScan®has been evaluated in many  liver 
diseases for the staging of liver fibrosis, and has been demonstrated to be very effective for 
differentiating cirrhosis (F4) from no cirrhosis (<F4), but it is less cap able of differentiating 
gradations of fibrosis. In a large stud y by Castera et al. [Castera, L., et al 2008] , in a 
population of participants with chronic HCV infection, a cut -off of 12.5 kPa was selected for

and 91%, respectivel y, and the negative predictive value was 95%. Since this analy sis was 
assessed specificall y in participants with chronic HCV infection, the cut-off value >12.5 kPa 
used by  Castera was selected to include cirrhotics in the current stud y.
Pregnancy Testing 9.5.6.2
For WOCBP (see Appendix 5) , a urine pregnancy test must be performed at the site on 
Day 1, with negative results prior to initiating study  treatment .If the urine pregnancy test 
result is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed. If the result of the serum 
pregnancy  test is positive, the participant must be excluded from the study  per Section 6.1 –
Inclusion Criteria .
Ongoing pregnancy  testing will be conducted per the SoA.  If t he participant has a confirmed 
positive serum pregnancy  test, study  treatment must be discontinued per Section 8.1 –
Discontinuation /Withdrawal Criteria and the pregnancy  reported per Section 9.3.6 –
Pregnancy  and Exposure During Breastfeeding.

Confidentialstudy  medication , the participant should withhold their dose until reporting to the clinic. The 
predose PK sample will be obtained and the dose will be administered at the clinic. The date 
and time of each PK sample as well as the date and time of the last dose of EBR/G ZR prior 
to the PK sample will be recorded.
All PK samples will be used to evaluate PK exposures, and potentiall y also the PK -efficacy  
and PK
-AE relationships of EBR and GZR. The date and time of each PK sample as well as 
the date and time of the last dos e of EBR/GZR prior to the PK sample will be recorded.
The PK sampling schemes selected for Day  1 and TW4 facilitates the ability to estimate all 
PK parameters specified in the objectives. Day 1 intensive PK will be collected in Mini Age 
Cohort 1 to obtain an early  estimate of AUC to confirm that the appropriate dose is selected 
for Mini Age Cohort 2. The PK sampling at TW8 facilitates an assessment of PK exposure 
when ALT and/or AST elevations are anticipated to be maximal, if there are elevations.
The total blood volume required for PK anal yses of both GZR and EBR (combined) is 1 mL  
per sample.  The recommendations on safe blood sample volume limits for pediatric clinical 
research is provided in literature [Jack, R. 2001] . The total blood volume at each visit, 
accounting for PK and other sample collections is below the maximum blood limit 
requirements per blood draw on each visit. Also, the total blood volume collected within an y 
30-day period is below the max imum b lood limit requirements.
Recording and Entering Meal /Soft Food Vehicle Information
Participants will be provided a n
SMD which contains instructions for recording meal 
data that includes what they  eat/drink and the time of the meal. Participants or an 
observer ( legall y acceptable representative /caregiver) should record ALL meal data 
from 48 hours BEFORE the PK visit through the day  of the PK visit.
Participants receiving EBR/GZR pediatric formulation should record the soft food 
that EBR and GZR granul es were mixed into as well as the pediatric formulation food 
consumption timeframe (ie, the time from mixing of medication into the soft food 
vehicle to complete consumption of all granules that were mixed into the soft food) .  
Participants or an observer should record this information in the SMD for all doses.
The site will be responsible for entering the appropriate data from the SMD, as well 
as the qualitative fat content of the meal, in the eCRF according to the eCRF Entry  
Guidelines.  Meal data should be entered b y the site as follows:
oFor visits on Day 1(there will be no meal data entry  for pre-dose sample on 
Day 1), Week 4, and Week 8:
• E nter all meal data within 2hours before, and up to 1hour after the 
EBR/GZR dose adm inistered on the day prior to the predose PK visit.
• E nter all meal data within 2hours before, and up to 1hour after the 
EBR/GZR dose administered at the stud y site.

study .  The PP po pulation consists of the subset of participants who comply  with the protocol 
sufficiently  to ensure that theirPK data will be likely  to exhibit the effects of treatment, 
according to the underl ying scientific model. Compliance covers such considerations as 
exposure to treatment (participants’ dosing compliance should be such that their PK is 
expected to be at stead y state at the time of Week 4 assessment) , availability  of 
measurements ,and absence of major protocol deviations that may  affect achievement of 
steady  state at the time of Week 4 assessment.  Major protocol deviations will be identified to 
the extent possible prior to final database lock .  Any  participants or data values excluded 
from anal ysis will be ident ified, along with their reason for exclusion, in the CSR.  At the end 
of the trial , all participant s who are compliant with the trialprocedure sas aforementioned 
and have available data atthe Week 4 PK visit will be included in the PP popula tion.
Efficacy Analysis Population s 10.5.2
The FAS population will serve as the primary population for the anal ysis of efficacy  data in 
this study .  The FAS population consists of all allocated participant s who receive at least one 
dose of study  treatment. 
The mFAS w ill be used for supportive analys is of the efficacy  endpoints of SVR 12and 
SVR 24.  The mFAS population is a subset of the FAS population, with participants excluded 
for study  discontinuation for reasons unrelated to the treatment regimen.  Examples include
loss to follow -up, discontinuation from the study  due to non -drug-related AEs, informed 
consent withdrawal, a nd other non -virologic failures .  
The final determination on the exclusion of participants from an analy sis population will be

Section 10.6,Statistical Methods.
Statistical Methods 10.6
This section describe s the statistical methods that address the primary  and secondary  
objectives.  Methods related to exploratory objectives will be described in the sSAP .
Statistical Methods for Pharmacokinetic Analyses 10.6.1
Each NCA PK parameter of interest (AUC 0-24, Cmax, Ctrough, and CL/F)of EBR and GZR at 
Week 4 will be summarized separatel y by Age Cohort and treatment as appropriate, with 
GMs and 95% CIs based on natural log -transformed anal ysis and t distribution .
Individual values will also be listed for each PK parame ter at Week 4 by Age Cohort and 
dose level as appropriate, and the following (non -model -based) descriptive statistics will be 
provided: N (number of participants with non -missing data), arithmetic mean, standard 
deviation, arithmetic percent coefficient of variation ( CV)(calculated as 100 ×standard 
deviation/arithmetic mean), median, minimum, maximum, GM, and geometric percent CV 
(calculated as 100 ×sqrt(exp(s2) -1), where s2 is the observed variance on the natural log -
scale).   Descriptive statistics will also be provided for concentrations/ PK parameters obtained 
at other time points, as appropriate.
Modeling and Simulation for Dose Selection 10.6.2
The starting dose for Mini Age C ohort 2 may be refined, if needed, based on the descriptive 
PK data for Day  1 from Mini Age C ohort 1.  All PK data from Mini Age C ohort 1 and Mini 
Age C ohort 2 will be incorporated with previous adult data into the adult population PK and 
PBPK models , which will be continuously  updated as pediatric PK data become available 
from each Age Cohort.  Modeling and simulation will be used to select doses for Mini Age 
Cohort 3 and Expanded Age C ohort 1.  AllPK from these cohorts will in turn be used to 
update the model s, and select the dose for Expanded Age C ohort 2 /3.  Dose selection by  
weight bands will be used.  Weight bands will be determined based on PK anal yses. At each 
step, the goal of model -based simulations will be to derive a dosing regimen expected to 
provide similar exposures in pediatric patients as in adult s.  A separate Modeling and 
Simulation Analy sis Plan with further details on the methodology  may  be prepared.
Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses 10.6.3
Efficacy  results will be presented b y Age Cohorts (12 to <18 years, 7 to <12 years, 3 to <7 
years).  Res ults of participants in the Expanded Age Cohorts will be reported separatel y from 
those in the Mini Age Cohorts, unless the same dose was given to both Mini and Expanded

ConfidentialCohorts within the age group. If all participants in an Age Cohort received the same dose, 
then results of participants in both Mini and Expanded Age Cohorts will be reported together.
Missing Values
A missing data point for a given study  visit may  be due to any  one of the following reasons: 
a visit occurred but data were not collected or were unusable; a visit did not occur; or a 
participant discontinued from the study  before reaching the visit. Participant s who 
prematurel y discontinued the assigned treatment are encouraged to remain in the study  for 
the follow-up, if possible.
The HCV RNA outcome is categorized as TND, TD(u), and TD(q). There are 3 t ypes of 
missing data handled b y different approaches.
Type 1 is intermittent missing:
Intermittent missing: If a missing data point is immedia tely preceded and followed 
by non- missing HCV RNA outcomes, the missing value willbe imputed to the worst 
outcome of the two. For example, if a missing data point is preceded by  TD(q) and 
followed b y TD(u) or TND, then the missing value would be imputed 
as TD(q); if a 
missing data point is preceded b y TD(u) and followed by TND, then the missing 
value would be imputed as TD(u); when a missing value is flanked b y two TND, then 
the missing value would be imputed as TND.
Type 2 and 3 are both non- intermittent missing, but differ regarding their relationship to the 
study  drug:
Type 2 --Non-intermittent missing related to the study  drug: Missing values due to 
premature stud y discontinuations with reasons related to treatment either for safet y or 
efficacy . 
Type 3 --Non-intermittent missing unrelated to the study  drug:  Missing data due to 
premature stud y discontinuations with reasons unrelated to treatment such as loss to 
follow -up, protocol violation, withdrawal of consent/assent, administrative reasons, 
etc.
The following two approaches will be used to handle non- intermittent missing data (Ty pe 2 
and 3) due to premature discontinuations, depending on the anal ytical strategy , as described 
in the section below and in Table 10.
Missing = Failure (M=F) approach: Participants with non- intermittent missing re sults 
(ie,Type 2 or T ype 3 missing) will be imputed as having failed, regardless of the 
reason for study  discontinuation.
Treatment -Related Discontinuation = Failure (TRD=F) approach: Participants with 
treatm ent-related T ype 2 missing 
data will be considered as having failed; whereas 
participant s who have T ype 3 missing value sand have not experienced virologic 
failure during the observed study  period will be excluded from the anal ysis for the 
time points foll owing their study withdrawal. Participant s with documented virologic 
failure during the treatment or follow- up period, even if they  withdrew prematurely  
due to reasons not related to study  drug, are classified as failures.

Proportions of Participants With Virologic Responses
For the efficacy anal ysis to estimate the proportion of participant s achieving SVR 12, a 
95% CIwill be calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method [Clopper, C. J. and Pearson, E. 
S 1934] . The missing data approach of M=F described above will be utilized for the key
analysis. The same method will be use d to anal yze all binary  endpoints.
Sensitivity  analy ses will be performed for the primary  endpoint using the mFAS population 
and the TRD=F missing data approach.

Sample Size and Power for Efficacy Analyses 10.9.2
The key efficacy objective will be assessed based on the proportion of participants achieving 
SVR 12, defined as HCV RNA <LLOQ 12 weeks after the end of all stud y therap y. This is an 
estimation study  with no hy potheses. The expected response rate is ~ 95% based on previou s

Sample Size and Power for Safety Analyses 10.9.3
Thekeysafet y objective of this study will be assessed by a review of the accumulated safet y 
data. Certain safet y endpoints of special interest have been identified in Section 10.6.3 of 
this document.   Safety  results will be presented by Age Cohorts.  Results of participants in 
the Expanded Cohorts will be reported separatel y from those in the Mini Coho rts, unless the 
same dose was given to both Mini and Expanded Cohorts within the age group.  If all 
participants in an Age Cohort received the same dose, then results of participants in Mini and 
Expanded Cohorts will be reported together .
The probability  of observing at least one of a particular t ype of AEdepends on the number of 
participant s treated and the underl ying percentage of participant s with that AEin the study  
population. For instance, i f the underl ying incidence of a particular AEis 1% (1 of every  
100 participant s receiving the drug), there is a 20% chance of observing at least one AEof 
that ty pe among 22participant s. If no AEof that ty pe is observed among the 22participant s, 
this study  will provide 95% confidence that the un derly ing percentage of participant s with 
that particular AEis15.4%.
The estimate of, and the upper bound of the 95% CIfor, the underly ing percentage of 
participant s with an AE given various h ypothetical observed number of participant s with the

ConfidentialCompliance (Medication Adherence) 10.11
In this trial, the SMD will be used to monitor and document a participant’s drug compliance.  
Data reported on the SMD will serve as the primary  data for compliance analy sis.
A day  within the study  will be considered an “O n-Therap y” day if the participant takes the 
assigned treatment as noted in Section 7.5.1.
For a participant who is followed for the entire study  period, the “Number of Day s Should be 
on Therap y” is the total number of day s from dosing to the last scheduled day  for treatment 
administration for that participant .  For a participant who discontinued from the study  
permanentl y, the “Number of Days Should be on Therap y” is the total number of day s from 
dosing to the date of the last dose of s tudy medication.
For each participant , percent compliance will then be calculated using the following formula:

Merck Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck*
Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
I.Introduction
A. Purpose
Merck, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in 
compliance with the high est ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant safety is the overriding concern 
in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merck clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
B. Scope
Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merck irrespective of the 
party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This 
Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code 
does not apply to investigator -initiated trials which are not under the control of Merck.
II.Scientific Issues
A. Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices o f Merck or comparator products.  Alternatively, Merck may 
conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine 
participant preferences, etc.  
The design (ie, participant population, duration, sta tistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose 
of the trial.  Research participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2.Site Selection
Merck selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in Merck trials, as well as budgetary considerations.  Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by Merck personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the tria l.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical 
Practice.  Merck reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness and consistency. Data are verified v ersus source 
documentation according to standard operating procedures.  Per Merck policies and procedures, if fraud, 
misconduct or serious GCP -non-Compliance are suspected, the issues are promptly investigated. When necessary, 
the clinical site will be clo sed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified and 
data disclosed accordingly. 
B. Publication and Authorship
To the extent scientifically appropriate, Merck seeks to publish the results of trials it conducts.  Some early phase or 
pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing.  In such cases, publication of 
results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues 
of multipli city.
Merck’s policy on authorship is consistent with the requirements outlined in the ICH -Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines. In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, 
performance or interpretati on of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript.  All named authors must be able to 
defend the trial results and conclusions.  Merck funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications.

Protocol/Amendment No.:   079-02 
MK-5172-079-02 Final Protocol 16-Feb-2018
ConfidentialIII. Participant Protection
A.IRB/IEC review
All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site.  
Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the IRB/IEC prior to implementation, except that 
changes required urgentl y to protect participant safety and well -being may be enacted in anticipation of IRB/IEC 
approval. For each site, the IRB/IEC and Merck will approve the participant informed consent form. 
B.Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical tria ls is that participant welfare is of primary importance.  
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a 
minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care. Participants are never denied access to 
appropriate medical care based on participation in a Merck clinical trial. 
All participation in Merck clinical trials is voluntary.  Participants are enrolled only after providing informed consent 
for participation .  Participants may withdraw from a Merck trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, 
or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C.Confidentiality
Merck is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, t o the greatest extent possible.  Unless required by 
law, only the investigator, sponsor (or representative) and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential 
medical records that might identify the research participant by name.  
D.Genomic Re search
Genomic Research will only be conducted in accordance with informed consent and/or as specifically authorized by 
an Ethics Committee.
IV.Financial Considerations
A.Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive.  It is Mer ck’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of Merck trials.  Merck does not pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials.  However, when enrollment is particularly chall enging, additional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
Merck does not pay for participant referrals.  However, Merck may compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review to identify potentially e ligible participants.
B.Clinical Research Funding 
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by Merck, and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial.  However, the loc al IRB/IEC may wish to alter 
the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution.  As noted above, 
publications resulting from Merck trials will indicate Merck as a source of funding.
C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices including, in the U.S., those established by the American Medical 
Assoc iation (AMA). 
V. Investigator Commit ment
Investigators will be expected to review Merck’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing 
the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards.

Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
Definition of AE
AE Definition
●An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally  associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered 
related to the stud y treatment.
●NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a study  treatment.
●NOTE: for purposes of AE definition, study  treatment (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes an y pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, device, 
diagnostic agent or protocol specified procedure whether investi gational (including 
placebo or active comparator product) or marketed, manufactured b y, licensed by, 
provided b y or distributed by the sponsor for human use in this study.
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
●Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry, or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, or are considered clinicall y significant in 
the medical and scientific judgment of the i nvestigator.
●Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
●New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
●Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
●Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication. 
●Forall reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated 
adverse event, the AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test 
result.  An overdose without any  associated clinical sy mptoms or abnormal laboratory  
results is reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without 
adverse effect.”
●Any new cancer or progression of existing cancer.

ConfidentialEvents NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
●Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
● Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
●Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) presen t 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
●Surgery  planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre- existing condition that has 
not worsened.
● Refer to section 9.3.5 for protocol specific exceptions
Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met 
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
●The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalizat ion or prolongation of existing hospitalization
●Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay , even 
if the hospitalization is a precautionary  measure for continued observation.  (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre- existing condition that has not 
worsened is not a serious adverse event.  A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition 
that is diagnosed prior to the use of a Merck product and is documented in the patient’s 
medical history .
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
●The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
●This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may  interfere with or prevent every day life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

●
in offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis
f.Other important medical events:
● Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may  not 
be immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize 
the participant or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
Additional Events reported in the same manner as SAE
Additional Events which require reporting in the same manner as SAE
●In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, 
although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor in the same 
timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are 
considered serious b y the Sponsor for collection purp oses.
●Is a new cancer;
● Is associated with an overdose.
Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE Recording
●When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.
●The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the Adverse Event 
case report forms/worksheets at each examination.
●It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the particip ant’s 
medical records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
●There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y the Sponsor. I n this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of 
the part icipant number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before 
submission to the Sponsor.
● The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the dia gnosis (not the 
individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

ConfidentialAssessment of Intensity
● An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
●The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE (and 
other reportable safet y event) reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the 
following categories: 
●Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  the participant, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.  (for pediatric trials, 
awareness of s ymptoms, but easily  tolerated)
●Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently  discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities. (for ped iatric trials, definitely acting like something is wrong)
● Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for 
rating the intensit y of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe 
(for pediatric trials, extremely  distressed or unable to do usual activities).
Assessment of Causality
● Did the Sponsor's product cause the adverse event?
● The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor's product caused the adverse 
event will be provided b y an investigator who is a qualified physician.  The 
investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that 
supports the causalit y noted on the AE form, ensures that a medi cally qualified 
assessment of causality  was done.  This initialed document must be retained for 
the required regulatory  time frame.  The criteria below are intended as reference 
guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship 
between the test product and the adverse event based upon the available 
information
●The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between 
the Sponsor's product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the 
components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensit y), the more 
likely  the Sponsor's product caused the adverse event:
●Exposure:   Is there evidence that the participant was actuall y exposed to the 
Sponsor's product such as:  reliable history , acceptable compliance assessment 
(pill count, diary , etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodil y specimen?
●Time Course:   Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor's product? I s the time of onset of the AE 
compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational 
medicinal product)?

Product: MK-5172 112
Protocol/Amendment No.:   079-02 
MK-5172-079-02 Final Protocol 16-Feb-2018
Confidential●Likely Cause:   Is the AE not reasonabl y explained by  another etiology  such 
as underl ying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental 
factors
●Dechallenge: Was the Sponsor's product discontinued or 
dose/exposure/frequency reduced?
●If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
●If yes, this is a positive dechallenge . 
●If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note:  This criterion is not applicable if:  (1) the AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability ; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of 
the Sponsor's product; (3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor's 
product(s) is/are only  used one time.)
●Rechallenge:   Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor's product in this 
trial?
●If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
●If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. 
●If no, this is a negat ive rechallenge.
(Note:  This criterion is not applicable if:  (1) the initial AE resulted in death 
or permanent disability , or (2) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (3) 
Sponsor's product(s) is/are used onl y one time.)
NOTE:  IF A RECHALLENGE IS P LANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHI CH 
WAS SERI OUS AND WHI CH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR'S 
PRODUCT, OR IF RE
-EXPOSURE TO THE SPONSOR'S PRODUCT POSES 
ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE PARTI CIPANT THEN 
THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANC E BY THE SPONSOR 
CLINICAL DIRECTOR, AND IF REQUIRED, THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW 
BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHI CS COMMITTEE.
●Consistency with Study treatment Profile: Is the clinical/pathological 
presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the 
Sponsor's product or drug class pharmacology  or toxicology ?
● The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets 
by an investigator who is a qualified ph ysician according to his/her best clinical 
judgment, including con sideration of the above elements.
● Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a Sponsor's product relationship).
●Yes, there is a reasonable possibility  of Sponsor's product relationship:
There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor's product.  The temporal sequence 
of the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor's product is 
reasonable.  The AE is more likely  explained by  the Sponsor's product than by

Confidentialanother cause. 
●
No, there is not a reasonable possibility  of Sponsor's product relationship:
Participant did not receive the Sponsor's product OR temporal sequence of the AE 
onset relative to administration of the Sponsor's product is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely  explained by  another cause than the Sponsor’s product.  (Also 
entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)
●
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an ass essment of causality .
●There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s make an assessment of caus ality for every  event 
before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
●The investigator may  change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality  assessment.
●Thecausality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements
Follow -up of AE and SAE
●The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  Sponsor 
to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This 
may include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.
●New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
●The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
Reporting of AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Events to th e Sponsor 
AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event Reporting to Sponsor via Electronic 
Data Collection Tool
●The primary  mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the electronic data 
collection (EDC) tool.  
●Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry  guidelines (or 
equivalent).
●If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will 
use the paper AE Reporting form.

available.
●After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken off -line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
●If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated 
data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool ha s been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or by 
telephone (see next section).
●Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via Pape r CRF
● If the electronic data collection tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or 
secure e -mail of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the Sponsor.
●In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by  
telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service.
● Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF p ages within the designated reporting time frames.
●Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be 
found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).

Definitions 
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below) 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
●
Premenarchal
●Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
○ Documented h ysterectomy
○Documented bilateral salpingectomy
○Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical ex amination, or medical history interview.
●Postmenopausal female
○A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. 
▪A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therap y (HRT). However, in the absence 
of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH measurements in the 
postmenopausal range is required . 
○Femal es on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non -hormonal highly  effective contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the study . Otherwise, they  must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of post menopausal status before study  enrollment.
Contraception Requirements
Female Participants
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use 
one of the contraception methods described in consistently  and correctl y during the protocol -

A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be u sed. 
●Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relati on to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.) 
Notes: 
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants of clinical studies.
a) Typical use failure rates are lower than perfect -use failure rates (i.e. when used consistently and 
correctly). 
b) If hormonal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to interaction with study treatment, 
condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the treatment period and for at 
least [X days, corresponding to time needed to eliminate study treatment plus 30 days for study 
treatments with genotoxic potential]   after the last dose of study treatment .
c)If locally r equired, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, 
acceptable hormonal contraceptives are limited to those which inhibit ovulation .

d.DNA:  Deox yribonucleic acid.
e.RNA:  Ribonucleic acid.
2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research
The specimens consented and/or collected in this trial as outlined in Section 9.8 –Future 
Biomedical Research Sample Collection will be used in various experiments to 
understand:
oThe biology  of how drugs/vaccines work
oBiomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed b y the body
oOther pathway s drugs/vaccines may  interact with
oThe biology  of disease
The specimen(s) may  be used for future assay  development and/or drug/vaccine 
development.
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individua ls 
respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately  
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations 
with the greatest need.  All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those workin g for 
or with the Sponsor.

c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens
Documentation of participant consent for Future Biomedical Research will be 
captured in the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). An y specimens for which 
such an informed consent cannot be verified will be destro yed.
d. Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s)
Collection of specimens for Future Biomedical Research will be performed as 
outlined in the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for 
Future Biomedical Research, these will usuall y be obtained at a time when the 
participant is having blood drawn for other tria l purposes.
4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research 
In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with Future Biomedical Research 
specimens, it is critical to link participant' clinical information with future test results. I n 
fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical trial data to the 
specimen. The clinical data allow specific anal yses to be conducted. Knowing participant 
characteristics like gender, age, medical history  and treatm ent outcomes are critical to 
understanding clinical context of analy tical results.
To maintain privacy  of information collected from specimens obtained for Future 
Biomedical Research, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All 
specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below. 
At the clinical trial site, unique codes will be placed on the Future Biomedical Research 
specimens.  This code is a random number which does not contain an y personally 
identify ing information embedded within it. The link (or key ) between participant 
identifiers and this unique code will be held at the trial site.  No personal identifiers will 
appear on the specimen tube.  
5.Biorepository Specimen Usage
Specimens obtained for the Sponsor wil l be used for anal yses using good scientific 
practices.  Anal yses utilizing the Future Biomedical Research specimens may  be 
performed b y the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a universit y investigator) 
designated b y the Sponsor. The investigator c onducting the anal ysis will follow the 
Sponsor’s privacy  and confidentiality  requirements. Any  contracted third party
 anal yses 
will conform to the specific scope of anal ysis outlined in this sub- trial. Future Biomedical 
Research specimens remaining with th e third party  after specific anal ysis is performed

Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research 
Participants may  withdraw their consent for Future Biomedical Research and ask that 
their biospecimens not be used for Futu re Biomedical Research.  Participants may  
withdraw consent at an y time by  contacting the principal investigator for the main trial. If 
medical records for the main trial are still available, the investigator will contact the 
Sponsor using the designated ma ilbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). 
Subsequently , the participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository  and 
restricted to main study use only. If specimens were collected from study participants 
specificall y for Future Biomedical Research, these specimens will be removed from the 
biorepository  and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming 
withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to 
inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable.  
Any anal yses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already  
performed prior to the request being received b y the Sponsor will continue to be used as 
part of the overa ll research trial data and results. No new anal yses would be generated 
after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main trial are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required b y regulatory  authorities to retain the main trial 
records) or the specimens have been completel y anonymized, there will no longer be a 
link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, 
the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destructi on cannot be processed. 
7. Retention of Specimens 
Future Biomedical Research specimens will be stored in the biorepository  for potential 
analysis for up to 20 y ears from the end of the main study . Specimens may  be stored for 
longer if a regulatory  or governmental authorit y has active questions that are being 
answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions 
have been adequatel y addressed.
Specimens from the trial site will be shipped to a central laboratory  and then shipped to 
the Sponsor -designated biorepository . If a central laboratory  is not utilized in a particular 
trial, the trial site will ship directly  to the Sponsor -designated biorepository . The 
specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited ac cess facility which 
operates to assure the integrity  of the specimens.  Specimens will be destroy ed according 
to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the 
biorepository  database.
8.Data Security
Databases containing sp ecimen information and test results are accessible only  to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated trial administrator research 
personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highl y secure, and is 
accomplished using network securit y policies and practices based on international 
standards to protect against unauthorized access.

Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants
No information obtained from exploratory  laboratory  studies will be reported to th e 
participant, famil y, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability , and concerns regarding misinterpretation.
If important resear ch findings are discovered, the Sponsor may  publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to 
rapidly  report this information to doctors and participants.  Participants will not be 
identified by name in any published reports about this study  or in any  other scientific 
publication or presentation.
10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population
Every  effort will be made to recruit all participants diagnosed and treated on Sponsor 
clinical trial s for Future Biomedical Research.
11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research 
For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been minimized. No 
additional risks to the participant have been identified as no additional specimens are 
being collected for Future Biomedical Research ( ie,only leftover samples are being 
retained).
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies and procedures to address participant 
data privacy  concerns.  Data privacy  risks are largely  limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach of confidentiality .  In this highl y unlikely situation there is risk that the 
information, like all medical information, may  be misused.

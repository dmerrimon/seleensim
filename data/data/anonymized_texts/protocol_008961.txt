VISUAL PERFORMANCE AND PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH A NEW MONOFOCAL INTRAOCULAR LENS  
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
Current visual outcomes expectations of cataract in some patients are similar  to those of refractive 
surgery patients. Their desire is to be  spectacle independent for far, intermediate and near  vision 
activities . Some may have already enjoyed freedom from  glasses and would like to continue after the 
cataracts are removed. Different options are available. These options include: mono -vision and 
presbyopia correcting intraocular lenses (IOL).  
Mono -vision can be achieved using monofocal IOLs by setting the non -dominant eye to -1.75 (range may 
vary according to patient’s preference -1.25 to -2.50 D) and the dominant eye to plano at time of 
cataract surgery, or  postoperatively  using contact lenses , or undergoing LASIK.   
Presbyopia correcting IOLs (PCIOLs) include accommodative, multifocal ( MIOLs, bi and tr ifocals ) and 
extended  depth of focus (EDOF) IOLs .   Patients’ complaints of glare and halos are common with all 
MIOLs  and EDOF . The severity of these symptoms varies  according to the actual IOL design . These 
optical phenomena  may prevent a large percentage of patients fr om choosing a PCIOL  even though they 
still want to achieve spectacle independence postoperatively  at all distances . 
Monofocal lenses correct only at the target distance chosen (i.e., distance without intermediate or near 
vision improvement or near without distance improvement). Intermediate vision has become important 
for many daily activities such as reading a mobile p hone or tablet. Tecnis Eyhance IOL, recently approved  
by the FDA,A is a new generation of monofocal lenses designed to improve and/or enhance intermediate 
vision without compromising the distance vision with low incidence of halo, glare or starburst. Auffa rth 
et al1 in a study that included 67 patients implanted bilaterally with the Eyhance IOL showed an 
improvement of 1 line of intermediate visual acuity compared to a standard monofocal IOL (ZCB00) . 
Additionally, they reported no differences between the 2 groups in contrast sensitivity and visual 
disturbances complains.  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes of a monofocal IOL with an enhanced 
intermediate function, in patients with or without astigmatism , when both eyes are targeted for 
emmetropia and when the non -dominant eye is targeted for mini monovision ( -0.75 D) in patients 
undergoing routine cataract surgery.  
 
1. OBJECTIVE:  
 
The main objective of this study is to  evaluate the visual outcomes of a monofocal IOL with an enhanced 
intermediate function, in patients with or without astigmatism , when both eyes are targeted for 
emmetropia and when the non -dominant eye is targeted for mini mono vision ( -0.75 D) in patients 
undergoing  routine cataract surgery.

3. Study Procedures  
 
A. Informed Consent / Subject enrollment  
Potential subjects will be identified from the patients presenting at the clinic. Additionally, an 
ad will be placed in social media  and in the practice website , if deemed necessary . Once 
identified as a study candidate, the patient will be asked if he/she would like to participate. The 
sub-investigator, study coordinator or an appropriately trained staff member will answer any 
and all questions and will obtain informed consent. A co py of the signed informed consent 
document will be given to the subject. The principal investigator will be available if the subject 
wants to discuss further details with him.  Any testing that is part of th e investigative site’s 
standard preoperative cataract evaluation may be performed prior to the informed consent 
being signed, provided these tests are conducted within 90 days of surgery. The patient will 
understand that participation in the study, or decl ining to participate, will not affect his/her 
quality of care.  
 
No subject will be enrolled into the study that does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
does not sign the current approved informed consent document. Informed consent will be 
obtained prior to collecting any data for the study. The original sign ed documents will be 
maintained by the investigator as a permanent part of the subject's research records . 
 
B. Surgery Procedures:  
Patients will be randomized to one of two groups:  
• Group A,  plano OU. The target refraction for both  eyes will be emmetropia (± 0. 25 D). 
• Group B, mini mono vision. The target refraction for the dominant eye will be plano (± 
0.25 D) and for the non -dominant eye between -0.75D ±0.15 .

4. Study endpoint criteria  
 
A. Patient Completion of Study: If a study patient has completed the final visit (Visit 5) of the 
study, he/she is considered to have completed the study.  
 
B. Patient Discontinuation: Each study patient may voluntarily discontinue the study at any time 
they choose.  Study patients who cannot complete the study for administrative reasons (e.g., 
non-compliance, failure to meet visit schedule, etc.) will be discont inued from the study.  Study 
patients discontinued during the enrollment phase (prior to surgery) of the study will be 
replaced.  
 
C. Patient Termination: A study patient will be terminated if the study patient develops any severe 
adverse event that may be related to the study.  A study patient will receive appropriate 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator.  Notification of ter mination will be clearly 
documented.  These study patients are considered to have completed the study and will not be 
replaced.  
 
D. Study Termination: The investigator with appropriate notification may terminate the study.  If, 
after clinical observations, the investigator feels that it may be unwise to continue the study, he 
may stop the study.  
 
E. Study Completion: The study will be complete when all enrolled patients have completed Visit 5 
or have been terminated from the study.  
 
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
A. Sample  size 
The sample size estimates depend in large part on the standard deviation (SD) for logMAR 
UCIVA. Assuming a SD of 0.12 (from a previous Eyhance study), for the two -sided t -test (alpha 
=0.05) for the intermediate visual acuity endpoint, we will need 31 subjects in each group 
(emmetropia / mini monovision) to detect differences of 0.1 logMAR (1 l ine difference) with 
90% power.  Total sample size = 62.  Allowing 10 % for the potential confounding factor of 
having 2 sites, and 10% assumed dropout rat e, 74 subjects will be enrolled (37 in each group). 
Table 2 summarizes the sample size estimate.

B. Statistical Analysis  
All data will be collected by the site and entered into a database.  Subjects will be assigned an 
ID number. Data analysis will be performed without patient identification. Statistical analysis 
will be performed using standard descriptive statistics and other tests as deemed appropriate 
based on the characteristics of the data to be analyzed. All statistical tests will be two -sided and 
interpreted at a 5% significance level.  Comparisons between the groups will be  made.  Data 
analysis will be conducted by a third -party  consultant.

treatment -related.  Comparison of treatment groups with respect to the proportion of study 
patients reporting adverse events will be made using Fisher’s Exact Test.  
 
 
6. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
A. Confidentiality  
To ensure confidentiality in this study, records of the participants will be examined only by the 
principal investigator and research staff involved in the study.  Study records will be kept on file at 
each site.  Any statistical analysis and publication will not include any subject identifiers.  Medical 
records will be made available only for review by the inve stigators, study Monitor or Auditor, 
Sponsor Company or Research Institution, the IRB, and other State or Federal Regulatory Agencies, if 
necessary.  All information in these records will be kept confidential.  
 
B. Records Retention  
The PI is accountable for the integrity, retention and security of all study related data. The 
investigator must maintain accurate, complete and current records relating to the clinical  
study. The investigator must maintain the required records during the investigation and for a period 
of 3 year after the date on which the investigation is terminated or completed.  
 
7. STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING  
 
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data  
required to complete the case report forms (CRFs) exist and are accessible for verification by the 
monitor.  If electronic source records are maintained, these records must be 21 CFR Part 11 
compliant and will be printed and certified for verification by t he monitor as needed.  
 
Required examination must be recorded on the CRFs. Provided CRFs can be used as source 
document.  All data reported must have corresponding entries in the source documents. The 
principal investigator or sub -investigator must review the reported data and ce rtify that the CRFs 
are accurate and complete. No subject identifiers should be recorded on the CRFs beyond subject 
number, subject initials and study specific identifiers.  
 
Data from CRFs will be entered into a database provided to each site, site will email the password 
protected file to the study manager with the CRFs for remote monitoring. Additionally, monitoring 
site visits will be made by the study manager throughout th e study.  
 
Upon completion of the CRFs, the data will be reviewed by study manager and statistician for  
accuracy and completeness. If corrections and/or any additions to the data are deemed

necessary, queries will be generated and forwarded to the investigative site. Designated research 
staff is expected  to respond to data queries in a timely manner and ensure that the corrections and 
changes made to the data in the database are reflected in the subjects’ source documentation. Any 
changes will need to be initialed and dated by the authorized personnel mak ing such changes.  
Data will not be sold to third parties nor will it be used for future research.  
Electronic data will be stored and accessed on a portable device. The laptop is password protected 
and only the study manager has access to it. Additionally, database will be password protected.  
 
8. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 
A. Description  
The Eyhance  IOLs (DIB00 and DIUxxx ) are monofocal refractive IOLs design ed to enhance  
intermediate distance vision without compromising distance vision.    The lens power continuously 
increases from its edge to the center extending the range of vision when compared to a standard 
monofocal IOL.  
 
B. Treatment/Dosing Regimen  
The Tecnis Eyhance IOL  is intended for primary implantation for the visual correction of aphakia 
secondary to removal of a cataractous lens in adult patients. The IOL will be implanted at time of 
uncomplicated routine cataract surgery. Intraocular lenses are implantable medical  devices and are 
intended for long term use over the lifetime of the patient.  
 
C. Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment/Dosing Groups  
Each site  will be provide d with  randomization envelopes. The envelopes will be sequentially 
numbered . 
 
D. Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Since the IOL is implanted at time of cataract surgery, subject compliance will not be an issue in this 
particular study.  
 
E. Packaging, Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
An account will be set up with the manufacturer of the lens (Johnson and Johnson Vision) that will  
provide the lens at no cost to the participants. IOLs will be ordered once the subject’s qualification  
for the study has been confirmed. IOLs will be shipped to the site and will be stored and dispensed  
following the routine standard of care for cataract surgery. Unused IOLs will be returned to Johnson  
and Johnson Vision following their instructions.  
 
Or, Johnson and Johnson Vision will provide a consignment of lenses that will be stored at the site  
and unused IOLs will be returned to Johnson and Johnson Vision following their instructions at the

end of the study.  
 
In both instances, an implantation log will be kept.  
 
9. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION  
 
This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, 
and Good clinical practice.  The Investigator and all clinical trial staff will conduct the clinical trial in 
compliance with this protocol. The Investigator will ensure that all personnel involved in the conduct 
of the clinical tr ial are qualified to perform their assigned duties through relevant education, 
training, and experience. Deviations from the clinical protocol must be documented in each 
subject’s study records including the dates and reasons for each deviation. The PI mus t ensure that 
all aspects of the trial are in compliance with the applicable regulatory laws and conditions of

10. RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
The risk of being in the study is not greater than the risk of undergoing routine cataract surgery with 
implantation of monofocal intraocular lenses. However, there is always the risk that uncommon or 
previously unknown side effects may occur.  The study includes additional postoperative 
examinations at no cost.

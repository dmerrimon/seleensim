The Children's Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government, 
which will help us protect the privacy of our research subjects.  The Certificate protects against the 
involuntary release of information about subjects collected during the course of our covered studies.  The 
researchers involved in the studies cannot be forced to disclose the identity or any information collected in 
the study in any legal proceedings at the federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, 
administrative, or legislative proceedings.  However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily 
disclose the pro tected information under certain circumstances.  For example, if the subject or his/her 
guardian requests the release of information in writing, the Certificate does not protect against that 
voluntary disclosure.  Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, 
such as a DHHS request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA request under the 
Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. 
 
The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against mandatory disclosure by  the researchers of 
information on suspected child abuse, reportable communicable diseases, and/or possible threat of harm to 
self or others.  
 
ABSTRACT  
Poly(ADP -ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are a family of enzymes involved in DNA repair through the 
recruitm ent and activation of proteins that primarily utilize the base excision repair (BER) pathway.  
PARP1, the family’s founding member, binds to damaged DNA through its N- terminal zinc finger motifs; 
binding activates its catalytic C -terminal domain to hydroly ze NAD+ and produce linear and branched 
poly(ADP -ribose) (PAR) chains.  These PAR chains have a net negative charge, which promotes 
recruitment of DNA repair proteins involved in the BER pathway to the site of DNA damage, and facilitates 
removal of PARP1 f rom damaged sites allowing access to other repair proteins.  PARP2 is essential for the 
viability of PARP1.  BMN 673 is a novel, highly potent orally administered PARP 1/2 inhibitor which was shown to be well tolerated and have great therapeutic promise in  adult patients harboring intrinsic DNA 
repair deficits, such as germline BRCA1/2 , in an early phase 1 clinical trial.  Preclinical studies have strongly 
suggested that PARP inhibitors have additional mechanisms of action against certain cancers. For examp le, 
it has been shown that PARP1 is a key co -factor in ETS positive tumors such as EWS -FLI1  and EWS -ERG  
chimera Ewing sarcoma which in vitro  is exquisitely sensitive to available PARP inhibitors.  
Temozolomide, an orally administered monofunctional SN -1 alkylating agent, which is used in the 
treatment of a variety  of pediatric tumors, has been theorized to potentiate PARP inhibition through the 
creation of persistent single nucleotide gaps in double stranded DNA which would normally be repaired by 
endogenous PARP enzymes.  When BMN 673 in combination with low -dose short duration temozolomide 
was modeled through in vitro  and mouse human tumor xenograft models, the treatment showed impressive 
activity in a broad range of pediatric cancers including Ewing sarco ma, Wilms tumor, medulloblastoma 
and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).   
 
This study is a P hase 1/2 trial of BMN 673 in combination with low -dose short duration temozolomide in 
children with relapsed or refractory malignancies.  This trial will be the fi rst assessment of BMN 673 in 
children.  In addition, it is testing a novel mechanism of temozolomide in combination such that it is almost 
exclusively used as a potentiating agent; not in a manner that would be classically “synergistic.” Temozolomide will be given, at early dose levels, in low doses that are individually sub- therapeutic and 
therefore, minimally toxic. This allows for BMN 673 to be given on an intermittent schedule in combination with temozolomide , at or near the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  when given as a single agent  on a 
continuous, daily schedule in  adults .  Part A of the trial (Phase 1)  will be a traditional dose escalation study 
using a 3+3 design to find the MTD  and/ or recommended Phase 2 dose  (RP2D) , in each 28 day cycle, of 
once dai ly temozolomide given for 5 days when combined with a dose of BMN 673 (400 mcg/m
2/dose or 
600 mcg/m2/dose) given once daily for 5 days after a one day dose  of BMN 673  (400 mcg/m2/dose or 600 
mcg/m2/dose). The Day 1 dose for BMN 673 will be administered eit her once daily or twice daily. Part B  
and Part C  of the t rial (Phase 2)  will examine the efficacy of this combination at the MTD/ RP2D  in Ewing

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
BMN 673 is a new, orally available, highly potent and specific inhibitor of PARP 1 and 2 
designed to have an improved therapeutic index relative to existing PARP inhibitors in 
development. 
 
2.1.1 Poly(ADP -ribose) Pol ymerase (PARP)  
DNA damage caused by toxins, including both naturally occurring environmental poisons and chemotherapy, is repaired by a number of mechanisms including base 
excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), 
single strand annealing (SSA), homologous recombination (HR) and 
nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ).  Poly(ADP -ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are 
a family of enzymes involved in DNA repair through the recruitment and activation of proteins that utilize primarily the BER pathway,
2 but also the NHEJ3 
and HR4 pathways.  PARP1, the family’s founding member, binds to damaged 
DNA through its N -terminal zinc finger motifs; binding activates its catalytic C -
terminal domain to hydrolyze NAD+ and produce linear and branched poly(ADP -
ribose) (PAR) chains.  These PAR chains have a net negative charge, which promotes recruitment of DNA repair proteins, involved in the BER pathway, to the 
site of DNA damage, and facilitates removal of PARP1 from damaged site s 
allowing access to other repair proteins.
5  PARP2 is essential for the viability of 
PARP1  knockout mice .5  PARP inhibitors mimic NAD+ and bind to the protein’s 
catalytic domain.6  This both inhibits necessary NAD+ binding and inhibits t he 
auto- modification needed for PARP to eventually release from its complex with 
DNA6.  Both catalytic inhibition and trapping of PARP -DNA complexes lead to 
replicati on fork damage and cellular apoptosis.6 
 
It has been noted, that in several tumor types, that PARP1 is over expressed and 
that its overexpression is associated with a n overall poor prognosis. Most recently, 
it was noted that certain tumors, such as those harboring BRCA1/2  and PTEN  
mutations have a high rate of defects in the HR pathway of DNA repair and 
therefore, by using a PARP inhibitor, salvage pathways of DNA repa ir are blocked 
and apoptosis results.7  Several PARP inhibitors have been developed and in pre-
clinical models have not only shown powerful cytotoxicity in BRCA1/2  and PTEN  
aberrant cell lines but have also had proof of targeting concept confirmed through 
demonstration that these compounds are in fact inhibitors of PARP enzymes 1 and 
2.8,9  For tumors that carry BRCA1/2  and PTEN  mutations, PARP inhibition with 
first generation PARP inhibitors such as veliparib and olaparib are being investigated and thus far show much promise in terms of anti- cancer activity.
10,11              
 
2.1.2 Enhancing PARP inhibitory effects through its combination with temozolomide 
Temozolomide is an orally administered monofunctional SN -1 alkylating agent 
that creates DNA damage by adding met hyl adducts to nitrogen atoms in the DNA 
ring and the extracyclic oxygen group.12  After being converted to MTIC (5 -3-
methyltriazen -1-yl) imidazole -4-carboximide) at physiologic pH, methyl groups 
are transferred preferentially to the N7 position of guanine followed by the N3

03/23/17  
 
 
10 
 
position of adenine and O6 position of guanine.12  Although it is the least 
frequently methylated adduct, O6 methylguanine is regarded as responsible for the 
direct cytotoxicity of temozolom ide13 because it initiates MutSα and MutLα 
dependent mismatch repair during second or later cell cycles (after the methylation insult) leading to double-strand break formation and apoptosis.
14   
 
Temozolomide has been shown to have limited activity as a single agent in pediatric early phase clinical trials.  Estlin, et al. reported responses (complete 
response [CR] and partial response [PR]) in the single agent phase 1 setting, in 2 
out of 5 patients with high grade astrocytomas and long term stable disease (SD) in one out of 10 patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
15 while a similar 
study by Nicholson, et al. reported, out of 59 evaluable patients, 10 with SD, 2 
with a PR and 1 with a CR.16  In the single agent phase 2 setting, DeSio, et al., 
reported a 13.4% CR+PR+minor response (MR) rate and a 38.5% SD rate among 52 pediatric patients with relapsed solid tumors using 215 mg/m
2/day x 5 days in 
patients with no  history of craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and 180 mg/m2/day x 5 
days in those with a history of CSI.17  The median survival was 7.8 months.17  
Responding tumors were mostly CNS tumors and neuroblastomas with no 
responses seen in those with Ewing sarcoma family of tumors.17  In a similar phase 
2 single agent setting, Nicholson, et al. noted 5 PRs and 1 CR among 113 children with relapsed/refractory CNS tumors.
18  In leukemias, Horton, et al., reported a PR 
in 2 of 16 pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving temozolomide single agent once daily for 5 days at either 200 mg/m
2/dose or 270 mg/m2/dose.19   
 
Temozolomide has been far more effective in combination with additional agents.  
Activity in this setting has been seen in  a broad range of tumors including CNS 
tumors, Ewing20 and other sarcomas,21 neuroblastoma22 and CNS lymphoma.23  
The concept of combining temozolomide with PARP inhibitors has recently been particularly attractive.  Methylated DNA bases, created with temozolomide 
treatment, are repaired through the BER pathway.
24 An intermediate of this process 
has a single nucleotide gap in double stranded DNA containing the 5’ -deoxyribose 
phosphate (dRP) group at one margin.24 PARP1 binds to and is activated by the 
dRP group and is important in an efficient repair.24  Therefore, when combined 
with PARP inhibitors, which would block BER, temozolomide induced cytotoxicity would result not only directly from O6 methy lguanine but also 
indirectly from N7 methylguanine and N3 methyladenine.
24 Several early studies 
have suggested in vitro  legitimacy of this theory as temozolomide has shown an 
impressive ability to sensitize Pol β -null mouse fibroblasts,24 lymphoid and 
myeloid leukemias25 and neuroblastoma26 to PARP inhibitors in model systems.  
 
2.1.3 PARP inhibition in Pediatric Tumors 
As outlined below, there is a role for the use of PARP inhibitors, particularly 
administered in combination with DNA damaging agents, in a variety of pediatric 
malignancies, including CNS and solid tumors as well as hematologic 
malignancies.  
 Medulloblastoma:  BRCA1/2  aberrant tumors have not been reported to occur in 
childhood.
27,28  However, like BRCA1/2, PTEN  is a tumor suppressor gene known 
to play a critical role in the DNA damage response and DNA repair.  Because PTEN  inactivation spontaneously causes double str anded DNA breaks and

11 
 
diminishes the NER, HR and NHEJ DNA repair mechanisms29 PARP inhibition 
would be a rational therapy in tumors with aberrant PTEN activity such as 
medulloblastoma,  the  most common malignant CNS tumor of childhood.  Roughly 
40% of patients with medulloblastoma will die from their disease and therefore, it accounts for almost 10% of all pediatric cancer deaths.
30  Through both loss of 
heterozygosity of chromosome 10q (where PTEN is located)31 and through 
promoter hypermethylation, PTEN  mRNA and protein levels are known to be 
significantly lower in medulloblastoma when compared to normal cerebellar 
tissue.32  For this reason PARP inhibitors are already being explored in 
medulloblastoma although mainly as a sensitizing agent concomitant with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
33   
 
Germ Cell Tumors: PARP inh ibitors may also serve as a rational targeted agent 
in testicular germ cell tumors. While these tumors generally have an excellent survival rate, an estimated 350 people die of testicular germ cell tumors per year 
in the United States.
34  Recent evidence shows that testicular germ cell tumors have 
high levels of PARP and a high rate of DNA repair mechanism defects.35 Proof of 
concept has been shown in vitro  as germ cell tumor lines proved to be sensitive to 
the PARP inhibitor olaparib both as monotherapy and in combination with 
cisplatin.36    
 Ewing sarcoma:  Ewing sarcoma is a primitive tumor, likely of mesenchymal stem 
cells, which when clinically localized at diagnosis has a 5 -year overall survival 
(OS) of approximately 70%, but when metastatic, has an ov erall survival rate 
between 20-30%.
37,38 Patients with recurrent Ewing sarcoma also have a  dismal 
prognosis, with a 5- year OS of 30% when the disease recurs after 2 years and 7% 
when the disease recurs within 2 years.39 The most recent Phase 3 Children’ s 
Oncology Group study in Ewing sarcoma demonstrated that compressed delivery 
(every 2 weeks) of cycles of vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide 
(VAdrC) alternating with cycles of ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) had superior 
outcome with minimal additional toxicity when compared to the same therapy 
given every 3 weeks.40 Nevertheless, major advances in outcome using standard 
chemotherapeutic approaches have been elusive . Even maximizing cytotoxicity i n 
the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplant has failed to show improved outcome for Ewing sarcoma, with the risk of death approaching 8%
41 from 
treatment -related complications (i.e. treatment related AML/MDS, graft -versus-
host disease, infection) indicating that a limit of effectiveness of standard 
chemotherapy has been reached as a result of offsetting increases in toxicity.42,43 
 
Despite the fact that the cancer stem cell or cell of origin continues to be enigmatic, 
unlike survival advances using standard chemot herapy, the biological 
understanding of Ewing’s sarcoma has improved in recent years.  It is now known that Ewing sarcoma is a classic example of a malignancy driven by a fusion 
oncogene. Oncogenic fusions in Ewing sarcoma arise from specific chromosomal 
translocations that yield an in -frame fusion of the amino terminus of the EWS  gene 
on chromosome 22 and the carboxyl terminus, including the DNA binding domain, 
of an ETS family gene.  The ETS gene is FLI1  in 85% of cases, ERG  in 10% of 
cases and ETV1 , ETV4  or FEV in the remaining 5% of cases.
44  In-frame fusion of 
EWS  to an ETS factor in Ewing sarcoma, yields a highly expressed non-
physiologic transcription factor, which ac tivates an oncogenic program in the cell 
of origin.45  In vitro , the down regulation of the EWS -FLI1  fusion via antisense

12 
 
oligonucleotides, dominant -negative tra nscripts and RNAi has been shown to 
dramatically limit malignant transformation and reduce cell growth.46,47  However, 
translation of these basic science findings to the clinical setting has been 
challenging, limited in part by the inability of these agents to enter the cell as 
required to exert their respective effects.48  Early phase trials have begun with 
agents thought to indirectly interfere with the EWS -ETS translocations in Ewing 
sarcoma such as IGF1 -R inhibitors and ET -743 (trabectedin).49,50  However, recent 
pre-clinical data has demonstrated that a powerful inhibitor of EWS -ETS fusion 
can be found in PARP inhibition.  
In 2011, Brenner, et al., showed that PARP1 along with DNA -dependent protein 
kinase (DNA -PKcs) are key co -factors in ETS positive prostate cancer mediated 
by the ETS DNA binding domain.
51 This finding suggested that PARP inhibition 
might have key implications in treating cancer outside of their negative influence 
on DNA damage repair.  They demonstrated proof of concept by showing that 
therapeutic inhibition of PARP1 di srupted the growth of ETS positive but not ETS 
negative prostate cancer xenografts.  Secondary to the fact that the ETS interaction site is also present in EWS -FLI1  and EWS -ERG  chimeras, they hypothesized that 
PARP1 is also critical in the oncogenesis of Ewing sarcoma.  It was subsequently 
shown that, in fact, the EWS -FLI1  and EWS -ERG  fusion proteins do interact with 
and are dependent on PARP1 and that Ewing cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to the PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib in vitro.
52  Furthermore, olaparib drastically 
decreased the rate of metastasis in murine Ewing sarcoma xenograft models.52 
Contemporaneously and independently, a large screen of 130 drugs on 639 human cell lines unexpectedly found a highly significant association between the EWS -
FLI1  rearrangement and sensitivity to olaparib.
53 Screening of a structurally 
distinct PARP inhibitor, AG -014699, across a large panel of cell lines confirmed 
overwhelming sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma cell lines to PARP inhibition.  
Furthermore, the same screen found that sensitivity of Ewing cell lines to AG -
014699 were comparable to BRCA1/2  cell lines over 6 days and more sensitive 
than BRCA1/2  lines when tested over 3 days.  In summary, PARP inhibition 
appears to be a potential stra tegy in Ewing sarcoma not only secondary to its ability 
to potentiate DNA damage but also in its ability to inhibit the EWS -ETS- PARP1 
positive feedback loop in oncogenic transcriptional activation.       
 
Hematologic malignancies:  Recent work has shown tha t PARP inhibition is a 
logical strategy to test in hematologic malignancies in addition to solid tumors.  It has been shown that myeloid leukemia cells exhibit constitutive DNA damage and pronounced error -prone double stranded break DNA repair, which in part, explain 
the genomic instability of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
54,55  Follow-up 
experiments demonstrated  that exposure to PARP inhibitors can induce cell cycle 
arrest and apoptosis of primary AML samples and AML cell lines in vitro ; further 
analysis revealed that PARP inhibitor sensitivity was due to a defect in 
homologous recombination DNA repair.56  In a similar manner, certain lymphoid 
malignancies have been shown to be susceptible to PARP inhibition.  Ataxia 
Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene mutant cells are known  to exhibit impaired 
DNA double stranded break repair. Weston, et al. consequently showed that ATM deficient chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, T -prolymphocytic leukemia cells 
and mantle cell lymphoma cells were sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib in 
vitro .
57  In addition, PARP inhibition may be logical in T -cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (T -ALL).  It is well known that over 50% of cases of childhood and adult

T-ALL harbor activating mutations of NOTCH1, a regulatory transmembrane 
receptor that plays a crucial developmental role in cell fate determination and 
pattern formation, and in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and T cell fate 
specification in the m ature organism.58,59  Silva, et al., recently showed that T -ALL 
cells with NOTCH1 mutations had decreased PTEN mRNA expression.60  This 
decreased PTEN expression may make T -ALL cells susceptible to PARP 
inhibition. 
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies  
 
2.2.1 Antitumor Activity of BMN 673 
BMN 673 is  a new, highly potent and specific inhibitor of PARP 1 and 2 designed 
to have an improved therapeutic index relative to existing PARP inhibitors in development.  BMN 673 has been shown to have comparable inhibition of PARP 
1 and 2 both in cell culture and in MX -1 mammary tumor xenograft models and in 
vitro  at a lower concentration (IC
50=0.57nM) than PARP inhibitors ABT 888 
(IC 50=4.73nM), AG 14447 (IC 50=1.98nM) and olaparib (IC 50=1.94nM).  
Assessment of BMN 673 was performed on human cell lines harboring mut ations 
that compromise DNA repair pathways.  Gene mutations that confer selective tumor cell cytotoxicity included BRCA1  (MX -1 mammary tumor cells), BRCA2  
(Capan -1 pancreatic tumor cells), PTEN  (MDA -MB-468 mammary, LNCaP  and 
PC-3 prostate tumor cells) and MLH -1 mutations (HCT -116 colorectal tumor 
cells).  The IC
50 values of BMN 673 in these tumor cell lines were in the single 
digit nanomolar or sub- nanomolar range.  In contrast, the IC 50 of BMN 673 against 
normal human primary cell MRC -5 and several tumor cell lines that do not have 
reported DNA repair related mutations was significantly greater (250 nM to >1000 nM).
61  
 
In BRCA1  deficient MX -1 mouse xenograft models, oral administration of BMN 
673 at 0.33 mg/kg once daily for 28 days resulted in significant antitumor activity (tumor growth delay/tumor regression).  Dose -related inhibition of tumor growth 
was observed at l ower doses until doses higher than 1 mg/kg/day induced not only 
tumor suppression but also significant body weight loss with associated mortality.  Consistent with the anti- tumor effect in this model, profound reduction in 
poly(ADP -ribose) (PAR) levels (th e product of PARP1/2 and therefore, a measure 
of PARP activity) was observed in the MX -1 xenografts when mice were treated 
with BMN 673 orally.  Oral administration of BMN 673 also demonstrated anti -
tumor activity in the PTEN- deficient LNCaP , MDA -MD-468 and PC -3 mouse 
xenograft models.  In addition, twice -a-day oral administration of BMN 673 
delayed the growth of the MLH -1 deficient HCT -116 xenograft tumor in nude 
mice.  Assessment of various dosing schedules in the mouse xenograft models 
indicated that continuous suppression of PARP activity is required for optimal anti -
tumor activity.

2.2.2 Animal Toxicology of BMN 673 
Five day repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) studies with a 28 -day 
recovery were conducted in rats and dogs.  In dogs (the most sensitive species) 
BMN 673 was administered at several dose levels with severe pancytopenia being 
observed at the two highest dose levels (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg/day).  At these doses 
the mean reticulocyte nadir occurred on Day 6 and the platelet and WBC nadirs were on Day 11.  These changes were reversed in the 0.03 mg/kg/day group on 
Days 17 -18 (i.e. 12- 13 days after the last  administration of drug).  Several dogs 
treated at the highest dose level (0.1 mg/kg/day) died secondary to bacterial sepsis and others experienced hypoactivity, hyperthermia and fecal abnormalities on day 
12-13. Coagulation parameters were unaffected.  Therefore, at 5 day repeat dosing 
the highest non -severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was 0.03 mg/kg/day.  Twenty -eight 
day repeat dose toxicity and TK studies were also performed on rats and dogs.  In dogs (the most sensitive species) the only major toxicity at the doses studied were 
hematologic in nature at 0.005 and 0.01 mg/kg/day.  Mildly lowered red cell mass, 
mildly lowered platelet and absolute reticulocyte counts were noted but all 
recovered during the 28 day recovery phase.  Therefore, the HNSTD was 
determin ed to be 0.01 mg/kg/day.  From this the estimated safe clinical starting 
dose in humans was determined to be 1 µg/kg/day.
61  
 
2.2.3 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies of BMN 673  
Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in rats and dogs.  The oral bioavailability, calculated from AUC following oral administration relative to AUC following IV administration was 42.7% in rats  and 50.5% in dogs.  The 
terminal half -life of BMN 673 was between 28.5- 30.2 hours in rats and between 
69.7- 91.2 hours in dogs that allows for once daily dosing.  [
14C]-labeled BMN 673 
studies indicated that the drug was rapidly (but incompletely) absorbed within 15 -
30 minutes post dose.  Maximum plasma radioactivity was reached within 2-4 hours and declined to non- detectable levels within 48 hours in rats and within 72-
96 hours in dogs.  Steady state concentrations were reached on Day 15 in rats and on Day  20 in dogs using daily administration of BMN 673.  Excluding the GI tract, 
the highest levels of BMN 673 were observed in the kidney and liver.  Distribution to target organs of toxicity (thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen) BMN 673 was at levels hig her than blood at 8 hours and continued to be detected at 24- 72 
hours when blood levels were below limits of quantitation.  Radioactivity in the brain was generally below the level of quantitation except in the choroid plexus.  
All [
14C]-BMN 673 decreased to baseline by 168 hours post dose.  Elimination of 
BMN 673 was 90% at 24 hours post dose in the rat and 84% at 72 hours post dose 
in the dog.  Fecal elimination was the major route of excretion.  In vitro  metabolism 
studies demonstrated that BMN 673 has > 90% stability over 2 hours in hepatic 
microsomes.  However, in human hepatic tissues at concentrations up to 10 µM 
BMN 673 did not inhibit any of the five major human hepatic CYP isoenzymes 
(CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4).61

2.2.4 The Preclinical testing of BMN 673 and temozolomide from the Pediatric 
Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP)  
In order to test the hypothesis that temozolomide would create a DNA environment 
which would not only invite “classic” PARP inhibitor mechanisms in tumors 
deficient in HR DNA repair when treated with such drugs, but be able to expand 
the portfolio of malignancies which may respond to PARP inhi bition by creating 
DNA adducts, the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) evaluated BMN 
673 alone and in combination with temozolomide.62  Temozolomide doses of 0, 8, 
12, 30, 35 and 100 mg/kg/day were combined with doses of BMN 673 of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.33 and 0.5 mg/kg/day in tolerability (weight loss) experiments in mice.  
Determined tolerable, temozolomide at 30 mg/kg/day and BMN 673 at 0.1 
mg/kg/day x 5 days was compared to temozolomide at 12 mg/kg/day and BMN 
673 at 0.25 mg/kg/day x 5 days along with s ingle agents and vehicles in mouse 
explant experiments.  Single agent in vitro  testing of BMN 673 against the PPTP 
cell lines were consistent with earlier reported sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma.  The 
median relative IC50 (rIC50) value for the PPTP cell lines to BMN 673 was 28.4 
nM with the Ewing cell lines being the most sensitive (rIC50 = 6.4 nM) and 
significantly more sensitive than non -Ewing sarcoma cell lines (rIC50 = 40.1 nM, 
p=0.048).  However, in xenograft models, while BMN 673 showed some activity 
in Wilms tumor (KT -10) and medulloblastoma (BT -45), there was complete lack 
of activity in the Ewing sarcoma xenografts SK -NEP -1 and EW8 at 0.33 
mg/kg/day x 28 days.  An interesting observation during this phase of testing is 
that there appeared to be sensit ivity phenocopy between BMN 673 and cisplatin.  
Repeat in vitro  testing was performed using temozolomide from 0.3 µM to 1000 
mM in the presence of 10 nM BMN 673 with the median rIC50 value for temozolomide being 19.8 µM.  The cell lines with the lowest rIC50 values were 
those of Ewing sarcoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  In addition, it 
was noted that the level of potentiation with temozolomide exceeded that described for other PARP inhibitors and exceeded that described for the combination of 
PARP inhibitors and topotecan.  Mouse xenograft models recapitulated 
combination in vitro  testing and with treatment consisting of low dose 
temozolomide (12 mg/kg/dose daily) and BMN 673 (0.25mg/kg/dose twice daily) 
for 5 days responses were seen in Ewing, glioblastoma and Wilms tumor models with high level synergy demonstrated in 2 Ewing sarcoma xenografts (CHLA -258 
and TC -71) and synergy in 1 additional Ewing sarcoma xenograft (EW5).  These 
responses were noted with minimal animal weight loss and other gen eral toxicities.  
In mice, the single agent MTD of temozolomide is known to be 60 mg/kg.  Because the tolerability of temozolomide in the presence of BMN 673 was 12 mg/kg and the adult clinical dose of temozolomide administered daily x 5 is 150- 200 mg/m
2, 
the clinical dose of temozolomide likely to be tolerated with a “high” dose of BMN 673 is 30- 40 mg/m
2/day.61

2.3 Adult  Studies  
 
2.3.1 Phase 1 Studies  of BMN 673 
At the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting 2013, de Bono, et al., presented data for the first- in-human trial of BMN 673 performed in patients 
with solid tumors with known or suspected DNA repair abnorm alities (e.g. 
germline BRCA mutations, PTEN loss).  The trial was performed in patients ≥ 18 years of age with a standard 3+3 dose escalation design and included an expansion 
in ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreas cancers with germline BRCA mutations 
and additionally included patients with Ewing sarcoma family tumors and small 
cell lung cancer. Dosing was once daily, continuously, in 28- day cycles and began 
with a dose of 25 µg/day.  Thirty -nine patients were enrolled in the escalation and 
31 patients in to the expansion.  Overall, BMN 673 was well tolerated.  The 
recommended Phase 2 dose was 1000 µg with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) being thrombocytopenia. Myelosuppression occurred in 10- 20% of patients with chronic 
dosing requiring 11 patients to have dose reductions. Fatigue, nausea and alopecia occurred in 20- 30% of patients with no discontinuations necessary for adverse 
events. Elimination appeared to be bi -exponential with a t½, at the upper end of 
the dose range (900- 1100 µg) ranging from 53.5 to 66.1 hours and from 40.4 to 
51.8 hours on Days 1 and 35, respectively. Steady state was apparent in most 
patients by two weeks with daily dosing. Inhibition of PARP activity in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells was detected in patients dosed at ≥100 µg/day leading to 
substantial single agent anti -tumor activity in deleterious germline BRCA ovarian 
and breast cancer. Germline BRCA ovarian RECIST response rate was 44%, CA-
125 response rate was 70% and clinical benefit response rate was 82%, while 
germline BRCA breast response rate was 39% and clinical benefit response rate 
was 67%.
63  Updat es on the expansion cohort were provided at the 2013 AACR -
NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets  and Cancer 
Therapeutics and the ESMO/ECCO European Cancer Congress.  No additional toxicities of treatment were noted.  With a total of 28 BRCA aberrant ovarian 
cancer patients the clinical benefit response was 82% and with a total of 18 BRCA 
aberrant breast cancer patients the clinical benefit response was 78%.  Treatment 
was reported as on -going in 5/7 small cell lung cancer patients and 2 of 8 Ewing 
sarcoma patients with no objective responses noted as of the time of the report.

A second trial in adults with advanced hematologic malignancies with demonstrated or potential defects in DNA -repair pathways, including RAD51 foci 
formation or ATM deletions is a lso ongoing.  Pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) results are thus far similar, as are the adverse events; however, dose -limiting neutropenia has occurred in 2 of 5  patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia  at 900 µg/day with one patient 
experiencing neutropenic sepsis and both patients missing > 4 days of dosing due 
to Grade 4 neutropenia.  In 3 patients with MDS/AML, 1350 μg/day was well 
tolerated although 2000 μg/day resulted in dose limiting toxicities  in 2/4 
MDS/AML patients (personal communication, Andrew Dorr, BioMarin).

2.4 Pediatric Studies  
 
2.4.1 PARP inhibitors in combination with temozolomide in children  
 There is no experience with BMN 673 in children.  There is, however, recent phase 
1 experience with the PARP inhibitor veliparib (ABT -888), which was studied in 
combination with intermediate and standard dose temozolomide, in Pediatric Brain 
Tumor Consortium study PBTC -027.  Temozolomide was given once daily and 
ABT -888 given twice daily by mouth for 5 days every 28 day cycle to pediatric 
patients with recurrent central nervous system tumors. Five ABT -
888/temozolomide dose levels were studied: 20/180, 15/180, 15/150, 20/135 and 25/135 mg/m
2/dose, respectively.  Dose limiting toxicities included Grade 4 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia at the 20/180 and 15/180 mg/m2/dose levels. 
The Phase 2 recommended dose was 15 mg/m2/dose of ABT -888 wit h 135 
mg/m2/dose for 5 days in 28 day cycles. No objective responses were seen although 
4 subjects had stable disease >  6 months.66   
 
2.4.2 Rationale for the first in children combination Phase 1 study  
BMN 673 shows potent single agent in vitro activity in pediatric tumors, 
particularly  against Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Preclinical evaluation in mouse 
xenograft models performed by the PPTP demonstrated a dramatic reduction of 
tumor burden in a variety of pediatric solid tumor models (e.g., Ewing sarcoma, 
Wilms tumor, glioblastoma multiforme) when the PARP inhibitor BMN 673 was 
combined with a low dose, 5 day course of temozolomide.  The level of 
potentiation with temozolomide exceeds that described with many other PARP 
inhibitors or combinations of PARP inhibitors with other cytotoxic age nts. The 
preclinical results are consistent with the hypothesis that BMN 673 is converting 
relatively nontoxic N7 and N3 methylation adducts induced by temozolomide into 
toxic lesions.  In addition, there is the reasonable expectation that this combination  
will be safe.  The proposed starting dose for BMN 673 is less than 25% of its single 
agent recommended Phase 2 dose, per course, and the starting dose of 
temozolomide is only 10% of its single agent recommended Phase 2 dose.  
Furthermore, there is conside rable clinical experience with other PARP inhibitors 
administered with temozolomide and other than the expected enhancement of 
myelosuppression, unanticipated adverse events appear uncommon.  Thus, this 
combination represents a novel strategy for the treat ment of a variety of pediatric 
solid (including CNS) and hematologic malignancies.  
 
In the first in human study of BMN 673, PAR activity decrease was seen within 
hours even after a single dose of 100 µg.67 PAR activity decrease was consistently 
and predictably seen at 2 and 4 hours after the first dose of BMN 676 and then pre -
dose on Days 2, 3 and 5.  Therefore, steady state did not have to be reached in 
order to see significant decreases in PAR levels with BMN 673.  In addition, 
significant PAR levels were decreased at drug trough levels on Days 2, 3 and 5 
even when well below MTD dosing (personal communication, Andrew. Dorr, 
BioMarin).  However, optimal cell kill would be postulated when BMN 673 and 
temozolomide are close to steady state in plasma.  Be cause BMN 673 has a long 
half- life, pharmacokinetic modeling was performed to determine most efficiently 
to achieve a steady state of BMN 673.  A lead in phase of one day of twice daily 
BMN 673 prior to the 5 day course of once daily BMN 673 with once dail y 
temozolomide was determined to provide optimal exposure base on 
pharmacokinetic modeling.  In addition, this modeling predicts that even with day

18 
 
1 twice daily administration, plasma drug levels should not exceed that achieved 
by adults during phase 1 tr ials  
 
 
 
 
 
Intra -patient dose escalation in part B  (Amendment #3) : Patients  enrolled in Part 
B of the trial will receive Cycle 1 treatment at the RP2D defined in Part A. 
Following completion of Cycle 1, up to two intra -patient dose escalations may 
proceed in subsequent cycles if the patients  have had no more than minimal 
toxicities (as defined in Section 5.3.3.2 ) and the criteria to advance to the next 
cy
cle have been met.  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.3 Potential biomarkers to predict respon se in Ewing sarcoma patients 
The identification of prognostic biomarkers will be important for the future development of BMN673 in Ewing sarcoma.  Several studies of PARP inhibitors 
have explored both baseline PAR levels and PAR level dynamics in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as  an easily accessible tumor -surrogate tissue which 
could provide outcome predictions. While PAR levels have uniformly decreased with 
PARP inhibitor treatment, no correlation has been made between PAR levels or PAR 
level changes in PBMCs and levels seen in tumor tissue or with disease response
66,68,69 
However, potential pr edictive biomarkers from disease tissue may correlate with 
response and should be explored.  Because of the importance placed on the discovery 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
19 
 
of reliable biomarkers as a predictor of response in developmental therapeutics, the 
submission of archival tissue will be required for patients in the Ewing sarcoma 
stratum of Phase 2.  Archival tissue will be assayed for potential biomarkers by 
immunohistochemistry. Since PARP and PARP inhibitors play a critical role in DNA 
repair, markers such as BRCA1, XPA and Chk2 will be explored.70 In addition, 
markers of interest, which have been correlated with disease outcome in Ewing 
sarcoma such as Cx43 and desmopla kin will be explored.71  Of particular interest will 
be exploring PARP -1 which has been noted to be highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma 
samples72 and those markers which have both been shown to correlate with outcome 
in Ewing sarcoma and are cell cycle regulators  such as CDKN2A and TP53.70,71

2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
This is a Phase 1 study of BMN 673 in combination with low dose temozolomide in patients 
with recurrent  or refractory solid t umors including CNS tumors , and a Phase 2 study of 
BMN 673 in combination with low dose temozolomide in recurrent or refractory Ewing 
sarcoma and recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia  (ALL) . BMN 673 will be given orally 
on Day 1 (either once or twice daily)  followed by BMN 673 and low dose temozolomide 
given together once per day on Days 2 -6 of each 28- day cycle. This study will aim to 
describe the pharmacokinetics and the toxicities of BMN 673 when given with low dose 
temozolomide with the goal of determining the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose of this 
regimen. The antitumor effect of this combination will also be described, more specifically 
in the Phase 2 portion of the study in pediatric patients with Ewing sarcoma and ALL . 
Additionally, during Phase 2 in patients with  Ewing sarcoma, this study will explore 
potential predictive biomarkers using archival tumor tissue.

4.0 PATIENT  ELIGIBILITY  
 
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days prior to 
enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  Laboratory values used to assess eligibility must be no older 
than seven (7) days at the start of therapy.  Laboratory tests need not be repeated if therapy starts 
within  seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess eligibility .  If a post -enrollment lab value is outside 
the limits of eligibility, or laboratory values are older  than 7 days, then the following laboratory 
evaluations m ust be re -checked within 48 hours prior to initiating therapy: CBC with differential, 
bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum  creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the 
patient may not receive protocol therapy and will be considered off  protocol therapy. Bone marrow 
aspiration or biopsy should be performed within 14 days prior to start of protocol therapy  for Phase 
2 patients with bone marrow involvement (Part B  and Part C ). Imaging studies must be obtained 
within 14 days  prior to start of protocol therapy  (repeat the tumor imaging if necessary).   
 
 
Clarification in timing when counting days : As an example, please note that if the patient’s last day 
of prior therapy is September 1st, and the protocol requires waiting at least  7 days for that type of 
prior therapy, then that patient cannot be enrolled until September 8th.   
 
Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and cannot be 
waived (per COG policy posted 5/11/01).  All clinical and laboratory data required for

4.3.3 Central nervous system  (CNS) involvement of leukemia at relapse diagnosis 
• CNS 1 : In cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), absence of blasts on cytospin preparation, 
regardless of the number of WBCs.  
 
• CNS 2 : In CSF, presence < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts, or ≥ 5/μL 
WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm:  
o CNS 2a: < 10/μL red blood cells (RBCs); < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive 
for blasts;  
o CNS 2b: ≥ 10/μL RBCs; < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts; and  
o CNS 2c: ≥ 10/μL RBCs; ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts but 
negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm (see below);  
 
• CNS 3 : In CSF, presence of ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts and/or 
clinical signs of CNS leukemi a or lymphoma:  
o CNS 3a: < 10/μL RBCs; ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;  
o CNS 3b: ≥ 10/μL RBCs, ≥ 5/μL WBCs and positive by Steinherz/Bleyer 
algorithm (see below);  
o CNS 3c: Clinical signs of CNS leukemia or lymphoma (such as facial nerve 
palsy, brain/eye involvement or hypothalamic syndrome).  
 
4.3.4 Method of evaluating initial traumatic lumbar punctures (LPs)  
If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and the lumbar puncture is 
traumatic and contains ≥ 5 WBC/μL and blasts, the following St einherz/Bleyer algorithm 
should be used to distinguish between CNS2 and CNS3 disease:  
 
CSF WBC  > 2X  Blood WBC  
CSF RBC             Blood RBC 
 
A patient with CSF WBC ≥ 5/μL blasts, whose CSF WBC/RBC ratio is 2X greater than 
the blood WBC/RBC ratio, has CNS disease at diagnosis.  
 
Example: CSF WBC = 60/μL; CSF RBC = 1,500/μL; blood WBC = 46000/μL; blood 
RBC = 3.0 X 106/μL: 
  60      =  0.04 >  2X  46,000  =  0.015

5.1 Overview  of Treatment Plan  
 
 Day 1  Days 2-6 Day 28  
Dose Levels  
-1 & 1  BMN 673 
(once daily) BMN 673  (once daily), and  
Temozolomide (once daily)  Evaluation 
Dose Levels  
2 to 6 BMN 673  
(twice daily)  BMN 673  (once daily), and  
Temozolomide  (once daily)  Evaluation 
 
BMN 673 will be administered ora lly once daily or twice daily on Day 1. The second dose 
of BMN 673 on Day 1 for Dose Levels 2 -6 will be administered 12 hours after the first 
dose. On Days 2 -6, BMN 673 will be administered orally once daily  (immediately before  
the temozolomide dose  in the  morning.  
 
NOTE:  BMN 673 dose and capsule strengths are in MICROGRAMS (mcg).  
 
Temozolomide  will be administered orally once daily in the morning on Days 2 -6 
immediately after the BMN 673 dose. At the discretion of the treating physician, t he use 
of antie metic therapy  is allowed  prior to low- dose temozolomide administration. For PCP 
prophylaxis guidelines refer to Section 7.3.1 . 
 
On days on which pharmacokinetic samples are collected, BMN 673 (during Cycle 1 on 
Day 1, and on Day 5 or 6) and temozolomide (during Cycle 1 on Day 5 or 6) should be 
administered on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after food or drink except water). Note:  Day 2 BMN 673 and temozolomide do not need to be administered on an 
empty stomach during Cycle 1. On non- pharmacokinetic study days, BMN 673 and 
temozolomide can be administered without food or drink restrictions (i.e., with or without 
food).  
 
A cycle of therap y is considered to be 28 days. A cycle may be repeated for a total of 24 
times, u p to a total duration of therapy of approximately 24 months. 
 Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and weight 
measured  within 7 days  prior to  the beginning of each cycle (see Appendix II -A
 and 
Appendix II-B ).   
 
The capsules should not be opened or crushed but should be swallowed whole. 
 
If a patient vomits within 30 minutes  after the dose of BMN 673 and/or temozolomide is 
administered, that dose of BMN 673 and/or temozolomide may  be repeated. Otherwise, 
that dose of BMN 673 or temozolomide will not be repeated . 
 
If the dose of BMN 673 or temozolomide is missed and less than 6 hours have passed 
since the scheduled dosing time, the BMN 673 or temozolomide dose should be taken 
immediately. If more than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the patient 
should not take the missed dose but should wait and take the next regularly scheduled dose.  
 
Update: The MTD/RP2D of Part A1 was determined to be: Day 1: 600 
mcg/m2/dose BMN 673 PO BID; Days 2 -6: 600 mcg/m2/dose BMN 673 
and 30 mg/m2/dose t emozolomide PO; on a 28- day cycle, maximum BMN

5.1.1 Intrathecal Therapy for Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Patients  
Patients may receiv e intrathecal chemotherapy in the second and subsequent cycles 
at the tr eating physician’s discretion . Intrathecal therapy , if given,  should be restricted 
to Days 15 and 22 of each 28 day cycle and its administration should be reflected on 
the respective r oadmaps and reporting period case report forms . 
        REMOVED  
 
5.2 Criteria for Starting Subsequent Cycles  
A cycle may be repeated every 28 days if the patient has at least stable disease and has 
again met laboratory parameters as defined in the eligibility section, Section 4.0 .  
 
5.3 Dose Escalation Schema  
 
5.3.1 Inter -Patient Escalation  [Phase 1 (Part A 1) only]   
The starting dose of BMN 673 will be 400 mcg/m2/dose (maximum daily dose is 
800 mcg/day). Subsequently, the BMN 673 dose for Do se Levels 3-6 will be 
fixed  at 600 mcg/m2/dose (maximum daily dose is 1000 mcg/day). The starting 
dose of temozolomide will be 20 mg/m2/dose (Dose Level 1) with dose levels for 
subsequent groups of patients as follows. 
 
NOTE :  BMN 673 dose and capsule strengths are in MICROGRAMS (mcg).

^ In the event that the recommended Phase 2 dose has not been reached by Dose Level 6 , 
additional dose levels may be added with BMN 673 dosed at 600 m cg/m2/dose and 
temozolomide escalated in 30% increments to a maximum of 150 mg/m2/dose (i.e. 70 
mg/m2/dose, 90 mg/m2/dose, 120 mg/m2/dose and 150 mg/m2/dose).  
 If the MTD has been exceeded at the first dose level, then the subsequent cohort 
of pati ents will be treated at a BMN 673 dose of 400 mcg/m
2/dose and a 
temozolomide dose of 15 mg/m2/dose (Dose Level -1).  
 If Dose Level - 1 is not well tolerated, further de -escalation will not occur. The 
study will be closed to accrual.  
 
5.3.2 Ewing sarcoma or Perip heral PNET  [Phase 1 (Part A2) only ]: If an objective

response is observed in a patient with Ewing sarcoma or Peripheral PNET  on Part 
A1 of the study, Part A2 of the study will open so that patients with Ewing sarcoma  
or Peripheral PNET  may actively enroll at any time.  Patients with Ewing sarcoma  
or Peripheral PNET  may enroll onto Part A2 if there are no available patient slots 
at the current dose level  on Part A1.  These patients may enroll  one dose level 
below the current dose level at which patients on P art A1 are actively enrolling , or 
at the starting dose level (Dose Level 1) if dose escalation has not yet occurred .  
 
5.3.3 Intra -Patient Escalation  
 
5.3.3.1  Phase 1 (Part A2 ) only 
Intra -patient dose escalation to a higher dose level will be allowed for Part 
A2 patient s on study in cycles of therapy subsequent to C ycle 1, provided 
the patient has not experienced dose-limiting toxicity  (DLT) at the dose at 
which they began therapy. Part A2  patients who are more than one dose 
level below the actively enrolling dose level in Part A1  can escalate one 
dose level per cycle until they reach the actively enrolling dose level , 
provided they do not experience a DLT when escalating. 
 
5.3.3.2  Phase 2 (Part B – Ewing sarcoma and peripheral PNET)  only 
Patients enrolled onto Part B of this study will receive study drug at the R2PD in Cycle 1. Intra -patient dose escalation, to the next highest Dose 
Level (as defined in Section 5.3.1
) will be allowed in cycles of therapy 
subsequent to Cycle 1, only for patients who  do not have PD and have 
experienced no more than minimal toxicities  (defined below) , considered 
at least possibly related to study drug. These patients may be dose escalated (per 
Section 5.3.1 ) to RP2D + 1 Dose Level for at  least one cycle, 
and subsequently may be escalated to RP2D + 2 Dose Levels if the subject 
continues to have never experienced more than minimal toxicities during 
therapy. A patient may not dose escalate beyond RP2D + 2 Dose Levels. 
In patients not eligibl e for dose escalation after any course due to greater 
than minimal toxicities, there will be no further attempt to dose escalate. Patients eligible to dose escalate after cycle 1, who are not dose escalated due to site related issues may start dose escalat ion in a subsequent cycle 
provided they meet all criteria for dose escalation. For patients who experience any dose limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined in 
Section 5.5 , 
after a dose escalation, dose modification rules defined i n Section 6  should 
be followed. Once a patient has required a single dose modification, no further dose escalations are permitted in that patient and the patient will 
receive the remaining therapy at the highest Dose Level at wh ich no dose -
limiting  toxicities were observed  in the patient . 
 Minimal toxicity for intra -patient dose escalation: Dose escalation is not allowed 
if any of the following conditions occur during a cycle:  Hematological Toxicity  
• >Grade 2 thrombocytopenia  
• >Grade 3 neutropenia  
Non-hematological Toxicity 
• Any Grade 3 or 4 non- hematological toxicity with the specific 
exclusion of: 
o Grade 3 nausea and vomiting < 3 days duration

o Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, including 
ALT/AST/GGT elevation that returns to Grade ≤ 1 or 
baseline prior to the time for the next treatment cycle. 
Note:  For the purposes of this study the ULN for ALT is 
defined as 45 U/L. 
o Grade 3 fever  
o Grade 3 infection  
o Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia 
or hypomagnesemia responsive to oral supplementation. 
• Any grade 2 non- hematological toxicity that persists for > 7 days 
and is considered medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by patients that requires treatment interruption.  
 
5.4 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.   A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can 
be downloaded from the C TEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Any suspected or 
confirmed dose -limiting toxicity should be reported imme diately (within 24 hours) to the 
Study Chair. 
 
5.5 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that  are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to protocol therapy .  The DLT  observation period for the purposes of dose -
escalation will be the first cycle of therapy.  
 
Dose limiting hematological and non -hematological toxicities are defined differentl y.   
 
5.5.1 Non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity  
5.5.1.1  Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non- hematological toxicity attributable to the 
investigational drug with the specific exclusion of:  
• Grade 3 nausea and vomiting < 3 days duration 
• Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, includin g ALT/AST/GGT  elevation 
that returns to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline prior to the time for the next 
treatment cycle. Note:  For the purposes of this study the ULN for ALT is defined as 45 U/L. 
• Grade 3 fever  
• Grade 3 infection  
• Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia , hypocalcemia or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to oral supplementation. 
 
5.5.1.2  Non-hematological toxicity that causes a delay of ≥ 14 days between 
treatment cycles.  
 
5.5.1.3  Note:  Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will 
not be considered a do se-limiting toxicity.

35 
 
5.5.2 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
 
5.5.2.1  Hematological dose limiting toxicity is defined as:  
 
• In patients evaluable for hematological toxicity (see Section  4.1.8.1 ),   
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 days 
• Platelet count < 20,000/mm3 on 2 separate days, or requiring a 
platelet transfusion on 2 separate days, within a 7 day period  
• Myelosuppression that causes a delay of > 14 days between 
treatment cycles.  
 
• In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, DLT  will be defined 
as failure to recover a peripheral ANC > 500/mm3 and platelets > 
20,000/mm3 by 42 days after the first treatment day, not due to 
malignant infiltration.  
 
5.5.2.2  Note:   Grade 4 febrile neutropenia will not be considered a dose -limiting 
toxicity.  
  
6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The Study Chair must be notified of any dosage modification or use of myeloid growth 
factor. 
 
Note: Patients with dose limiting toxicity should receive subsequent cycles at the next lower 
dose level (See Section 5.3.1). See Appendix II-A  and Appendix II-B
 for dosing nomogram.  
 
NOTE:  BMN 673 dose and capsule strengths are in MICROGRAMS (mcg).  
 
6.1 Dose Modifications for Hematolo gical Toxicity  
 6.1.1 Patients who have dose- limiting thrombocytopenia should receive subsequent 
cycles at the next lower dose level. Patients who experience dose -limiting 
thrombocytopenia after two dose reductions must be removed from protocol 
therapy. If a pat ient who was originally assigned to Dose Level 1 experiences dose-
limiting thrombocytopenia after a dose reduction to Dose Level -1 then that patient 
must be removed from protocol therapy. 
 
6.1.2 Patients who have dose- limiting neutropenia (Grade 4 neutropenia of > 7 days 
duration or delay in the start of the next cycle for > 14 days due to neutropenia) with no other dose -limiting toxicity should receive the same dose in the next cycle 
with myeloid growth factor support . Note:  Patients MUST NOT receive 
prophylact ic myeloid growth factor in the first cycle of therapy (See Section 7.4
). 
If Grade 4 neutropenia recurs after myeloid growth factor is added, then the patient 
should receive treatment  at the next lower dose level for subsequent cycles, a nd G -
CSF 5 mcg/kg/day SC or IV should be administered, starting 24 hours after the last 
dose of chemotherapy and continuing until the post -nadir ANC is ≥ 2,000/µl . 
Patients who experience dose- limiting neutropenia after addition of myeloid 
growth factor an d one dose reduction must be removed from protocol therapy.

6.1.3 Patients who have a dose- limiting hematological toxicity that does not resolve to 
meet eligibility or baseline parameters within 21 days after the planned start of the 
next treatment cycle must be removed from protocol therapy. 
 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematological Toxicity  
 
6.2.1 Patients who have any dose- limiting non -hematological toxicity (as defined in 
Section 5.5.1 ) may continue on protocol therapy upon meeting  eligibility lab 
requirements (or baseline if not specifically defined in the eligibility criteria  in 
Section 4.0 ) but should receive subsequent doses at the next lower dose level.  
 6.2.2 If non -hematological dose -limiting toxicity  recurs after one dose reduction, the 
patient must be removed from protocol therapy. 
 
6.2.3 Patients who have a dose- limiting non -hematological toxicity that does not resolve 
to meet eligibility or baseline parameters within 21 days after the planned start of 
the next treatment cycle must be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.3 Dose Modifications for Intra -patient Dose Escalation Part B  
 
For patients who experience any dose limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined in Section 5.5
, 
after a dose escalation, dose modification rules defined in Section 6.1  and Section 6.2  
should be followed. Once a patient has required a single dose modification, no further dose 
escalations are permitted and  the patient will receive the remaining therapy at the highest 
Dose Level at which no dose- limiting  toxicities were observed  in the patient.  
 
 
7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT  THERAPY 
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Concurrent cancer therapy, including  chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or 
biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients receiving study drug. If these treatments are administered the patient will be removed from protocol therapy. See 
Section 
4.1.7.2.a  and Section 5.1.1  for the exception related to intrathecal chemotherapy for 
patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  
 
7.2 Investigational Agents No other investiga tional agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
7.3 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary  (see Section 6.0
).  
 
7.3.1 Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP)  Prophylaxis (Recommended) 
There have been multiple episodes of PCP reported in patients  receiving 
temozolomide. For this reason, patients should receive PCP prophylaxis during 
treatment. TMP/SMX is recommended; monthly  pentamidi ne or other appropriate 
alternative antibiotic are also acceptable. PCP  prophylaxis should be discontinued 
3 months after chemotherapy has been discontinued. 
 
7.4 Growth Factors

8.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL  AND DATA TO BE ACCE SSIO NED 
 
8.1 Required Clinical, Laboratory and Disease Evaluation 
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days 
prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated. Laboratory values used to assess eligibility (see 
Section 4.0 ) must be no older than seven (7) days at the start of therapy.  Laboratory tests need 
not be repeated if therapy starts within  seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess eligibility.  If 
a post -enrollment lab value is out side the limits of eligibility, or laboratory values are older 
than 7 days, then the following laboratory evaluations must be re -checked within 48 hours prior 
to initiating therapy: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum  creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the patient may not receive protocol therapy and 
will be considered off protocol therapy. Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy should be performed 
within 14 days prior to start of protocol therapy for Phase 2 patients with bone marrow 
involvement (Part B  and Part C ). Imaging studies must be obtained within 14 days prior to start 
of protocol therapy (repeat the tumor imaging if necessary).

9.0 AGENT INFORMATION 
 
9.1 BMN 673 
(BMN 673ts, talazoparib , MDV3800) NSC# 771561 IND#  121510 
9.1.1 Structure an d molecular weight  
The chemical name of BMN  673 is  3H-Pyrido[4,3,2-de]phthalazin-3- one, 5-fluoro-
8-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,7,8,9-tetrahydro-9- (1-methyl -1H-1,2,4- triazol-5- yl)-, 
(8S,9R)-, 4- methylbenzenesulfonate (1:1).  The structure and molecular weight of 
BMN 673ts are C 26H22F2N6O4S and 552.5624, respectively.  BMN 673 is a potent 
and specific inhibitor of poly(ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor s (i.e.,  
PARP 1 and PARP2), which prevents PARP- mediated DNA repair of single strand 
DNA breaks via the base-exc ision repair pathway.  It has demonstrated synthetic 
lethality in tumors with defects in DNA repair pathways, such as BRCA mutations and PTEN dysfun ction. BMN 673 free base is the active moiety of  the BMN 673ts 
(tosylate salt ) formulation. 
 
9.1.2 Supplied by: 
BMN 673 capsules are supplied by  Medivation, Inc , and distributed by the 
Pharmaceutical Man agement Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI. 
 
9.1.3 Formulation 
BMN 673 is supplied as 100 mcg (opaque ivory, size 4) and 250 mcg capsules (opaque white, size 4)  packaged in 30 -count HDPE  bottles with an induction seal 
and child- resistant cap .  The hypromellose capsules contain a blend of BMN 673 
drug substance, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, titanium dioxide, red iron oxide, and yellow  iron oxide. 
 
9.1.4 Storage  
Store BMN 673 capsules a t room temperature (15- 30 °C/ 59-86 °F), protected from 
light, in the original container. BMN 673 capsules may be repackaged from the 
manufacturer -supplied HDPE bottle into a pharmacy -supplied HDPE bottle for 
dispensing purposes . 
 
9.1.5 Stability  
Shelf -life stab ility studies of BMN 673 capsules  are ongoing.  
 
9.1.6 Administration  
Give/ take BMN 673 by mouth on an empty stomach either one hour before or two 
hours after a meal  on pharmacokinetic study days (during Cycle 1 on Day 1 , and on 
Day 5 or 6). Note:  Day 2 BMN 673 do not need to be administered on an empty 
stomach during Cycle 1. On non- pharmaco kinetic  study days, BMN 673 can be 
administered without food or drink restrictions  (see Section 5.1 ).  BMN 673 should 
be taken immediately prior  to temozolomide on Days 2 through 6 of each cycle.  
 Based on in vitro  data, BMN 673 is not likely to inhibit metabolism via human 
cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzymes.  Effects of co -administration of repeat dosing 
of BMN 673 with  other drugs are unknown. 
 
The capsules should not be opened or crushed but should be swallowed whole.

The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a 
single list of reported and/or potential  adverse events (AE) associated with an agent 
using a uniform presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting 
(SPEER), appears in a separate column and is ident ified with bold and italicized text. 
This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to 
expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below). Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI 
Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelin
es.pdf  for further clari fication. Frequency is provided based on 232 patients . Below 
is the C AEPR for t alazoparib (BMN 673). 
 
NOTE:  Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in 
parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different 
SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

9.2 Agent  Ordering and Agent Accountability  
BMN 673 may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or their authorized designee) at 
each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires 
that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB 
does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB 
is obtained.) The CTEP assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
47 
 
supplied investigational agents.  The responsi ble investigator at each participating 
institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA 
form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data 
Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF ).  If there are several participating 
investigators at one institution, CTEP supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead investigator at that institution.  
9.3 Clinical Drug Request  
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shipping designees and 
ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application at https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx. Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management 
(IAM) account (https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/) and the maintenance of an “active” 
account status and a “current” password. For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, 
or accountability call (240) 276-6575 Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 4:30 
pm (ET) or email pmbafterhours@mail.nih.gov any time.  
 
9.4 Agent Inventory Records  
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a careful record of the inven tory and disposition of all agents received from DCTD using the 
NCI Drug Accountability Record (DAR) Form (See the NCI Investigator’s Handbook for Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage).  
 
9.5 Temozolomide- Oral       
 
 (Temodar, Temodal) NSC #362856                (09/09/13)  
 
9.5.1 Source and Pharmacology  
An orally administered alkylating agent, a second generation imidazotetrazine. A 
prodrug of MTIC, temozolomide spontaneously decomposes to MTIC at physiologic 
pH. Exerts its effect by cross -linking DNA. T his is likely a site specific alkylation at 
the O6-position of guanine with some effect at the N7 position. Temozolomide 
reaches its peak concentration in 1  hour. Food reduces the rate and extent of 
absorption. It has an elimination half -life of 1.13  hr (intraperitoneally) and 1.29 hr 
(orally) with an oral bioavailability of 0.98. Total apparent body clearance is 100 mL/min/m
2 and plasma elimination half -life is ~  100 minutes.  
 
9.5.2 The table below lists the anticipated toxicity profile of temozolomide (oral):  
Incidence  Toxicities  
Common  
(>20% of patients)  Constipation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, alopecia, alanine aminotransferase 
increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, ataxia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, 
nervous system disorders – other: hemiparesis or paresis, dizziness, gait disturbance, 
amnesia, paresthesia, somnolence, headache, seizure, fatigue  
Occasional  
(4-20% of patients)  Edema limbs, localized edema, rash maculopapular, dysphagia, mucositis oral, anemia, 
platelet count decreased,  white blood cell count decreased, lymphocyte count 
decreased, aplastic anemia, blood bilirubin increased, urinary frequency, cough, upper 
respiratory infection, sinusitis  
Rare 
(≤ 3% of patients)  Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, 
hypercalcemia, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, cholecystitis, alkaline phosphatase increased, myelodysplastic syndrome, leuk emia 
secondary to oncology chemotherapy, infections and infestations – other: Pneumocystis 
pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, anaphylaxis, allergic reaction , hepatic failure

Incidence  Toxicities  
Pregnancy & 
Lactation  Pregnancy Category  
Adequate, well -controlled studies have not been conducted in humans. Women of 
childbearing potential should be advised against becoming pregnant while taking 
temozolomide and for at least 6 months following the end of therapy. Temozolomide 
administration to rats and rabbits at 3/8 and 3/4 the human  dose resulted in the 
development of malformations of the external organs, soft tissues, and skeleton. These 
animal studies also demonstrated embryolethality (increased resorptions) at similar 
doses. There is no information available regarding the transmis sion of temozolomide 
during lactation; women should avoid breastfeeding while receiving temozolomide.  
 
9.5.3 Formulation and Stability:  
Temozolomide capsules are available in six different strengths (5, 20, 100  mg). The 
capsules vary in size, color, and imprint according to strength. In the US, capsules are 
packaged in 5 -count and 14 -count bottles. In other countries temozolomide may be 
packaged in 5- count, 14 -count or 20 -count bottles.  Temozolomide capsules are 
stored at controlled room temperature.  
 
9.5.4 Guidelines for Administration:  
See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of the protocol  (See Section 5 .0 and 
Section 6 .0). The capsules should not be opened or crushed but should be swallowed 
whole.  
 
There is a potential for medication errors involving temozolomide capsules resulting 
in drug overdosages, which may have been caused by dispensing/taking the wrong 
number of capsules per day and/or product usage exceeding the prescribed dosing schedule.  
 
When dispensing, it is extremely important that prescribing and dispensing include 
clear instructions on which capsules, and how many of each capsule(s) are to be taken per day. Only dispense what is needed for the course, and clearly indicate how many 
days of dosing the patient will have and how many days are without temozolomide 
dosing. When counseling patients, it is important for each patient/parent to understand the number of capsules per day and the number of days that they take temozolomide. 
It is als o important for the patient/parent to understand the number of days that they 
will be off the medication.  
 Each strength of temozolomide must be dispensed in a separate vial or in its original 
container (e.g., bottle or sachet). Based on the dose prescrib ed, determine the number 
of each strength of temozolomide capsules needed for the full course as prescribed by 
the physician. For example, 25 mg/day for 5  days would be dispensed as five 20 mg 
capsules and five 5 mg capsules. Label each container with the appropriate number of capsules to be taken each day. Dispense to the patient/parent, making sure each 
container lists the strength (mg) per capsule and that he or she understands to take the 
appropriate number of capsules of temozolomide from each bottle or vial to equal the 
total daily dose prescribed by the physician. Institutions that have the capability to 
dispense temozolomide as daily doses in a blister pack may do so, taking specific precautions to ensure that the appropriate dose is provided and tha t the patient is 
educated to understand the daily dosing regimen.

10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL  FROM PROTOCOL THERA PY AND OFF STUDY 
CRITERIA  
 
10.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Ther apy  
 
a) Clinical (including physical examination or serum tumor markers) or radiographic 
evidence of progressive disease (See Section 12.0 ). 
b) Adverse Events requiring removal from protocol therapy (See S ection 6.0 ). 
c) Refusal of further protocol therapy by patient/parent/guardian. 
d) Non-compliance that in the opinion of the investigator does not allow for ongoing 
participation. 
e) Completion of 24 cycles of therapy.  
f) Physician determines it is not in the patient ’s best interest.  
g) Repeated eligibility laboratory studies ( CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) 
or serum creatinine)  are outside the parameters required for eligibility prior to the start 
of BMN  673 (See Section 4.0  and Section 8.1 ). 
h) Study is terminated by Sponsor. 
i) Pregnancy . 
 
Patients who are removed from  protocol therapy during cycle 1 should continue  to 
have the required observations in Section 8.1  until the  originally planned end of the 
cycle or until all adverse events have resolved per Section 13.4.4 , whichever happens 
LATER. The only exception is  with documentation of the patient’s withdrawal of 
consent . Patients who are removed from protocol therapy in subsequent cycles should 
have the necessary observations to ensure adequate clinical care.  
 
Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet the criteria for Off 
Study (see below). Ongoing adverse ev ents, or adverse events that emerge after the patient 
is removed from protocol therapy, but within 30 days of the last dose of investigational agent, must be followed and reported via RAVE and CTEP -AERS  (if applicable).  Follow -
up data will be required unl ess consent is withdrawn.  
 
10.2 Off Study Criteria  
 
a) Thirty days after the last dose of the investigational agent.  
b) Death  
c) Lost to follow -up 
d) Withdrawal of consent for any further required observations or data submission.  
e) Enrollment onto another COG therapeutic (an ti-cancer) study

11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
Strata:  
Part A 1:    Patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and CNS tumors (Phase 1)  
Part A2:  Patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma  or Peripheral PNET  (Phase 1)  
Part B :    Patients with relapsed or refractory  Ewing sarcoma  or Peripheral PNET (Phase 2)  
Part C:  Patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) (Phase 2)  
         REMOVED 
Phase 1  (Part A1 ):  
A minimum of 3 evaluable p atients will be entered at each dose level for determination of 
MTD. Once the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been defined, up to 6 
additional patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors may be enrolled to acquire PK 
data in a representati ve number of young patients (i.e. patients < 12 years old).  Review of 
the enrollment rate into previous COG Phase 1 new agent studies indicates that 1 -2 patients 
per month are available, which will permit completion of Part A of the study within 21-42 
months if six evaluable patients are studied at  each of six dose levels to determine the MTD  
or RP2D.  A maximum of 94 patients is anticipated, assuming a 20% inevaluability rate.   
 
Phase 1  (Part A2 ):  
If an objective response is observed in a patient with Ewing sarcoma or Peripheral PNET  
on Part A1 of the study, Part A2 of the study will open so that patients with Ewing sarcoma  
or Peripheral PNET  may actively enroll at any time. Patients with Ewing sarcoma or 
Peripheral PNET  may enroll onto Part A2 if there a re no available patient slots at the current 
dose level on Part A1.  These patients may enroll one dose level below the current dose level at which patients on Part A1 are actively enrolling, or at the starting dose level (dose level 1) if dose escalation has not yet occurred. Up to 6 patients may enroll at each lagging 
dose level, for a maximum total of 30 patients in Part A2. Once the MTD or RP2D has 
been determined in Part A1, Part A2 will be closed to accrual.  
 
Intra -patient dose escalation to a higher dose level will be allowed for Part A2 patients on 
study in cycles of therapy subsequent to cycle 1, provided the patient has not experienced 
dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) at the dose at which they began therapy. Part A2 patients who 
are more than one dose level below the actively enrolling dose level in Part A1 can escalate 
one dose level per cycle until they reach the actively enrolling dose level, provided they do 
not experience a DLT when escalating.  
 
Phase 2  (Part s B and C ):  
Accrual to Part s B and C  will only open once the MTD or RP2D  has been determined in 
Part A 1, and may open concurrently with the PK expansion described above . Review of 
patient accrual onto recent Phase 2 studies indicates the following entry rates for the 
various tumors under study can be achieved:  
 
Disease Group   Patients/Year  
Ewing Sarcoma  or Peripheral PNET             10 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemias (ALL)             5 
   REMOVED 
  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
52 
 
A minimum of 10 evaluable patients and a maximum of 24 patients  are expected to enroll 
in Part s B and C combined, assuming an inevaluability rate of 20% . We anticipate that the 
entire study will require 12-29 months for enrollment and evaluation of all parts.  
 
Update: The MTD/RP2D of Part A1 was determined to be: Day 1:  600 
mcg/m2/dose BMN 673 PO BID; Da ys 2-6: 600 mcg/m2/dose BMN 673 
and 30 mg/m2/dose t emozolomide PO; on a 28- day cycle, maximum BMN 
673 dose: 1000 mcg/day. 
 
Intra -patient dose escalation to a higher dose level will be allowed for Part B patients on 
study in cycles of therapy subsequent to cycle 1, provided the patient has not experienced 
more than minimal toxicities  at the dose at which they began therapy. Part B patients may 
be dose escalated to RP2D + 1 Dose Level for at least one cycle, and subsequently may be escalated to RP2D + 2 Dose Levels if the patient  continues to have never experienced more 
than minimal toxicities (as defined in Section 5.3.3.2
) during therapy. 
 
 
11.2 Definitions  [Phase 1 ( Part A 1)] 
 
11.2.1  Evaluable For Adverse Effects  
Any patient who experiences DLT at any time during protocol therapy is 
considered evaluable for Adverse Effects.  (Note: patients who experience dose -
limiting PCP must have received PCP prophylaxis to be considered evaluable for 
this Adverse Effect) . Patients without DLT who rec eive at least 85% of the 
prescribed dose per protocol guidelines and had the appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed are also considered evaluable for Adverse Effects. 
Patients who are not evaluable for Adverse Effects at a given dose level during 
Cycle 1 will be replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose 
• The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one- third of patients 
on Part A1 experience DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy.  
 
• In the event that two DLTs  observed out of 6 evaluable patients are different 
classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), expansion of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered if all  of the following 
conditions are met:  
 
o One of the DLTs does not appe ar to be dose- related  
o The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
o The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, and 
IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable  
 In Part A 1, expansion will proceed according to the  rules of the 3+3 design 
(see Section 11.3
): Three additional patients will be studied.  If none of the 
initial three additional patients experiences DLT, the dose will be 
escalated. * If one of the initial three additional pa tients experiences DLT, 
expansion to a total of 12 patients will continue. I f fewer than 1/3 of patients 
in the expanded cohort experience dose -limiting toxicities, the dose escalation 
can proceed. * 
 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
53 
 
* If the expansion occurs in the last dose level, the recommended phase 2 dose 
has been defined and Part A1 will be closed. 
 
• The DLTs  observed in the pharmacokinetic (PK) expansion cohort will be 
counted towards the total number of DLTs observed at the MTD during the 
dose escalation portion of the study. If ≥ 1/3 of the cohort of patients at the 
MTD (during the dose escalation plus the PK expansion) experience DLT then 
the MTD will be exceeded .

11.3 Dose Escalation and Determination of MTD  [Phase 1 ( Part A 1)] 
As an added safety precaution, one evaluable patient will be initially enrolled at the first 
dose level.  Additional patients may co ntinue to enroll as described below only after this 
patient has been evaluated by the study leadership for treatment -related toxicities from 
his/her first course of therapy. 
11.3.1  Three patients are studied at the first dose level.  
 
11.3.2  If none of these three patients experience DLT, then the dose is escalated to the 
next higher level in the three subsequent patients.  
 
11.3.3  If one of three patients experiences DLT at the current dose, then up to three more patients are accrued at the same level.  
 
a)  If none of these thre e additional patients experience DLT, then the dose is 
escalated in subsequent patients.  If there are no further dose escalations, then 
the RP2D has been confirmed. 
 b)  If one or more of these three additional patients experiences DLT, then patient entry at that dose level is stopped.  (See Section 11.2.2
 for exception to rule).  
Up to three more patients are treated at the next lower dose (unless six patients have already been treated at that prior dose). 
 
11.3.4  If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be stopped (see 
Section 11.2.2
 for exception to rule).  Up to three more patients are treated at  the 
next lower dose (unless six or more patients have already been treated at that prior dose). The highest dose with less than two DLTs out of six evaluable patients will 
be the estimated MTD . 
 
11.3.5  Using this dose escalation scheme, the probability of escala ting to the next dose 
level, based on the true rate of DLT at the current dose, is given by the following table when there are 6 evaluable patients at the current dose:   
 True Adverse Effects at a Given Dose  
 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 
Probability of 
Escala ting .91 .71 .49 .31 .17 .08 
 
Thus, if the true underlying proportion of toxic events is 30% at the current dose, 
there is a 49% chance of escalating to the next dose.  
 In addition to determination of the MTD  or RP2D , a descriptive summary of all toxicities 
will be reported.  
 
Update: The MTD/RP2D of Part A1 was determined to be: Day 1:  600 
mcg/m
2/dose BMN 673 PO BID; Days 2 -6: 600 mcg/m2/dose BMN 673 
and 30 mg/m2/dose t emozolomide PO; on a 28- day cycle, maximum BMN 
673 dose: 1000 mcg/day.

11.4 Pharmacokinetic Studies and Response Analysis  [Phase 1 ( Part A )] 
 
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of BMN 673 will be performed 
to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The 
PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, including means, 
medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit).    
While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of BMN 673  in combination 
with temozolomide , patients will  have disease evaluations performed as indicated in 
Section 8.1
.  Disease response will be assessed according to RECIST criteria for patients 
with solid tumors  (Section 12.2) and according to criteria for CNS tumors ( Section 12.6 ). 
All disease responses will be reported descriptively.  
 
All these analyses  will be descriptive and exploratory  and hypotheses generating in nature . 
 
 
11.5 Study Design [Phase 2 ( Part s B and C )] 
 
The best response of disease to BMN 673 plus temozolomide will be examined separately 
in each of the two disease strata for Ewing sarcoma and ALL . Patients with Ewing sarcoma 
from Part A1 or A2 treated at the MTD/RP2D and who meet eligibility criteria for  Part B 
of the study will be counted in the Phase 2 evaluation.  The following  Simon’s optimal two 
stage design  will be used in each strat um. 
 
The two stage design for Part B and Part C  is illustrated below:  
 
 Cumulative Number of 
Responses  Decision  
Stage  1: Enter 10 evaluable 
patients  0 Terminate the trial because the 
agent is ineffective.  
1 or more  Proceed to Stage 2.  
Stage 2: Enter 10 additional 
evaluable patients  2 or less  Terminate the trial because the 
agent is ineffective.  
3 or more  Terminate the trial because the 
agent is effective.  
 
We will consider  BMN 673 plus temozolomide not of sufficient interest for further 
evaluation in a disease category if the true response rate is 5% and of sufficient activity if 
the tru e response rate is 25%. If BM N 673 plus  temozolomide has a true response rate of 
5%, the rule described above will identify it of sufficient activity for further study with probability 0.07 (type I error), and the trial will have an expected sample size of 14 with 60% probability of e arly termination. If BMN 673 plus temozolomide has a true response 
rate of 25%, the rule described above will identify it of sufficient activity for further study with probability 0.88 (power against the alternative hypothesis P  = 0.25).

11.6 Method of Analys is [Phase 2 ( Part s B and C )] 
 
Response in Ewing sarcoma  or peripheral PNET  patients will be determined according to 
RECIST as defined in Section 12.0 . For patients  with ALL , response criteria wi ll be based 
on the standard definitions of complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), partial 
remission, cytolytic (PR CL), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) using the 
leukemia rating scale and peripheral blood counts (See Section 12.5 ). These responses will 
be reported descriptively. A report on the efficacy assessment will be posted on the 
completed disease stratum as part of the semi -annual study committee meeting book report.  
 Toxicities for patients will be described separately.  Every effort will be made to accrue the 
number of patients needed to evaluate efficacy according to the schema in Section 11.5
. 
For strata not appropriately filled , descriptive statistics will be  employed to describe 
outcomes.  
 
11.7 Inclusion of Children, Women and Minorities  
 
The study is open to all participants regardless of gender or ethnicity.  Review of accrual to past COG studies of new agents demonstrates the accrual of both genders and all NI H-
identified ethnicities to such studies.  Efforts will be made to extend the accrual to a representative population, but in a Phase 1 trial which will accrue a limited number of 
patients, a balance must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on 
the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the one 
hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the 
other. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender , racial, or ethnic identity are noted, 
accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those differences more fully.

12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA 
 
12.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.   A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov). 
 
12.2 Response Criteria for Patients  with Solid Tumors  
See the table in section 8.0
 for the schedule of tumor evaluations. In addition to t he 
scheduled scans, a confi rmatory scan should be obtained 28 days following initial 
documentation of objective response. 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-
247, 2009].  Key points are that 5 target lesions are identified and that changes in the largest  
diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria. 
 
12.2.1  Definitions  
 
12.2.1.1 Evaluable for objective response : Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will be considered evaluable for 
response. For all other patients, only those patients who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
response.  
 
12.2.1.2 Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluab le but do not meet the definitions of 
measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -
target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
12.2.2  Disease Parameters  
 
12.2.2.1 Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ 20 mm by chest x- ray, as ≥10 mm with CT scan, or ≥10 
mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
might or might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator 
thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which 
such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol. 
 
12.2.2.2 Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
58 
 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed 
by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
12.2.2.3 Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), inclu ding 
small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, in flammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
12.2.2.4 Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themse lves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion that  can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A su m of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the  sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
12.2.2.5 Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each shoul d be 
noted throughout follow -up.

03/23/17  
 
 
59 
 
12.2.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to character ize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless 
the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
12.2.3.1 Clinic al lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
12.2.3.2 Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
However, CT is preferable.  
 
12.2.3.3 Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 
mm or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.  
 
12.2.3.4 PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion 
of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality 
for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PE T-CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over t ime.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
12.2.3.5 Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  
If markers are in itially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
60 
 
12.2.3.6 Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR ) in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
  Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria fo r response or 
stable disease.  
 
12.2.3.7 FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional 
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression 
(particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG- PET at baseline and a pos itive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow- up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the positive FDG- PET at 
follow- up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow- up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow- up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progr essing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that  is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
 
12.2.4  Response Criteria for Pa tients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease 
 
12.2.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <10 mm. If immunocytology is available, 
no disease must be detected by that methodology.  Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At lea st a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
61 
 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions 
is also considered prog ressions). Note:  in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease but 
unequivocal progression in non- target or non-
measurable disease, the patient has PD  if there is 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non-
target disease such that the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study 
 
12.2.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis) 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion incr ease.     
 
12.2.5  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his  “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.7 from a sequence of overall response assessments.

12.3 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors and Evaluable Disease  
 
12.3.1  Evaluable Disease  
The presence of at least one lesion, with no lesion that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension.  Such lesions may be evaluable by nuclear medicine 
techniques, immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers or other reliable measures.
  
 
12.3.2  Complete Response  
Disappearance of all evaluable disease.  
 
12.3.3  Partial response  
Partial responses cannot be determined in patients with evaluable disease  
 
12.3.4  Stable Disease (SD)  
That which does not qualify as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), 
or Progressive Disease.  
 
12.3.5  Progressive Disease  
The appearance of one or more new lesions or evidence of laboratory, clinical, o r 
radiographic progression. 
 
12.3.6  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his  “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.7 from a sequence of overall response assessments . 
 
12.4 Response Criteria  for Neuroblastoma Patients with  MIBG Positive Lesions 
 
12.4.1 MIBG Positive Lesions  
Patients who have a positive MIBG scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable for MIBG response. The use of 
123I for MIBG imaging is recommended for all 
scans. If the patient has only one MIBG positive lesion and that lesion was 
radiated, a biopsy must be done at least 28 days  after radiation was completed and 
must show viable neurobl astoma.  
 
12.4.2 The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by the treating 
institution:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Partial Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persiste nce of other MIBG positive lesions 
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions 
Progressive disease: Development of new MIBG positive lesions 
 
12.4.3 The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy 
for study endpoint. See Section 8.2.1  for details on transferring images to the 
Imaging Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by the treating institution for end of

course response assessments.  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra- osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesio ns are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by adding the scor e of all the segments. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
 
 
The relative score is calculated by dividing the absolute score at each time point 
by the corresponding pre -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
If morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspiration 
is present at enrollment, no tumor cells can be d etected by routine morphology 
on two subsequent bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least 21 
days apart to be considered a Complete Response. 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced). 
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
12.4.4 Over all Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his  “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the overall response assessments as described in Table 5 in Section 12.7.1
.

12.5 Response Criteria for Patients with Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
 
12.5.1  Complete Remission (CR)  
Attainment of an M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts in the bone marrow aspirate or 
biopsy if aspirate not available) with no evidence of circulating blasts or 
extramedullary disease and with recovery of peripheral counts (absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) > 500/μL and platelet count > 50,000/μL) .  
 
12.5.2  Partial Remission (PR)  
Complete disappearance of circulating blasts and achievement of M2 marrow status (≥ 5% or < 25% blast cells in the bone marrow aspirate or biopsy if aspirate not available). Attainment of a bone marrow CR (above) with proven persistence 
of extramedullary disease qualifies as a PR.  
 
12.5.3  Partial Remission –Cytolytic (PR CL) 
Complete disappearance of circulating blasts and achievement of at least 50% reduction from baseline in bone marrow blast count. 
 
12.5.4  Stable Disease (SD)  
This is present when the patient fails to qualify for eit her a CR, PR, PR CL or 
progressive disease.  
 
12.5.5  Progressive Disease (PD ) 
An increase of at least 25% in the maximum Absolute Peripheral Blast Count  
measured pre- therapy or during the first 14 days following start of therapy; or in  
patients who achieve a PR an increase in the bone marrow blast count of ≥ 25%  
relative to the minimum bone marrow blast count; or in patients who achieve a  CR 
an increase in the bone marrow blast count to ≥ 5%, the development of new  
extramedullary disease, or other clinical evidence of progressive disease. 
 
12.6 Response Criteria for Patients with CNS Tumors  
 
12.6.1  Measurable Disease  
Any lesion that is at minimum 10 mm in one dimension on standard MRI or CT, for CNS tumors. 
 
12.6.2  Evaluable Disease  
Evaluable disease is defined as at least one lesion,  with no lesion that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension. Such lesions may be evaluable by 
nuclear medicine techniques, immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers, 
CSF cytology, or other reliable measures.  
 
12.6.3  Selection of Target and Non -Target Lesions  
For most CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target”  
lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the thickne ss of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect 
(e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice). 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
65 
 
 
Any change in size of non- target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.  
 
12.6.4  Response Criteria for Target Lesions  
Response cr iteria are assessed based on the product of the longest diameter and its 
longest perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any 
established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in 
other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products o f the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial baseline measurements.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the  sum of the products 
of the  perpendicular diameters of the target lesion s, taking as reference the 
smallest sum of  the products observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
12.6.5  Response Criteria for Non- Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non- target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  
 
12.6.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be c lassified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
 
12.6.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of mark ers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table below. The overall response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the 
assessments of target, non -target, marker and new lesions in the preceding 
columns.

12.7 Best Response  
 12.7.1  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

accepted as disease progression.  
Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requ iring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

12.7.2  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR un til the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recor ded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolle d in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the data collection packet for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting. 
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 3) the grade  (severity); and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was 
associated with the event.  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label. 
 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribut e commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 4.0.  The  
description s and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 4.0 will be 
used for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE. 
 
Step 3 :  Review Table A  in this section to determine if: 
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol- specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that req uire special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol- specific exceptions to the reporting requirements.  
 
Note :  This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol 
treatment.  Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the  last dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the 
agent(s) must also be reported according to the instructions  in the table  
below. Attribution categories are as follows:  Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possible, Probable, and Defini te.

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI)  ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be consider ed serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adver se events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via CTEP -
AERS within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

≥ 24 hrs  Not required  
NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Repor ting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR.  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be reported via CTEP -AERS within 24 hours of 
learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24-hour report.  
o “7 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted within 7 calendar 
days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 7  calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
2 For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is  limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates hospitalization (or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be reported regardless of attribution and designation 
as expected or unexpected with the exception of any events identified as proto col-specific 
expedited adverse event  reporting exclusions. 
 
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disa bilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or

birth defects must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs following treatment with an 
agent under a CTEP IND. 
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial reg istration 
on all reports. 
 
Additional Instructions or Exceptions to CTEP -AERS  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Phase 1 
Trials Utilizing an Agent under a CTEP -IND or Non -CTEP IND:  
 
• Any death that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment  with an investigational 
agent which can be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not clearly due 
to progres sive disease must be reported via CTEP -AERS  for an agent under a CTEP or non- CTEP 
IND agent  per the timelines outlined in the table above.

• See also the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) in Section 9.1.7  of the 
protocol.   
 
As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that resolves and then recurs 
during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS  reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospitalization is associated with the recurring AE.  
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours (refer to Table A ) to NCI via 
the web at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov  (telephone CTEP  at: 301-897-7497 within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS  24-Hour Notification web- based application is 
unavailable) and by telephone call to the Study Chair . Once internet connectivity is 
restored, a 24- hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP -
AERS  by the original submitter at the site.  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit t he report within 5 or 7 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
72 
 
calendar days  of learning of the event  (refer to Table A ). 
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS  (Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page 
http://c tep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.h
tm. 
 
13.3 Expedited Reporting Methods  
 
13.3.1  CTEP -AERS  Reporting 
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System ( CTEP -AERS ) that can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
 
A CTEP -AERS  report must be submitted electronically  via the CTEP -AERS  
Web -based application located at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm.  If prompted to enter a sponsor email add ress, please type in: 
COGCADEERS@childrensoncologygroup.org. 
 
Fax supporting documentation to the NCI (fax # 301-230-0159) and send by email 
to the ADVL1411 COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator.  ALWAYS 
include the ticket number on all faxed and emailed documents . 
 
13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG data 
submission forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS  reporting. 
 
13.4.1  If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the most severe grade of the event should be reported . 
 13.4.2  If an adverse event progresses through several grades during one course of 
therapy, only the most severe grade should be reported. 
 
13.4.3  The duration of the AE is defined as the duration of the highest (most severe) 
grade of the Adverse Effects.  
 13.4.4  The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline or less than Grade 1, whichever level is higher (note that the resolution 
date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the AE 
decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 13.4.5  An adverse event that persists from one course to another should only be reported 
once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent course. An adverse 
event which resolves and then recurs during a different course, must be reported each course it recurs.

13.5 Other Recipients of Adverse Event Reports  
 
13.5.1  Event s that do not meet the criteria for CTEP -AERS  reporting ( Section 13.2 ) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the data 
form packet (See Section 14.1 ). 
 
13.5.2  COG will forward reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to 
the FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for 
industry sponsored trials). 
 13.5.3  Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to the local  policy and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS  
A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/int ervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.   
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treat ment (including AML/MDS) should also 
be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.   Second Malignancy:  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT  
a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
 
13.7 Reporting Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal 
When submitting CTEP -AERS  reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and faxed along with any 
additional medical  information to (301) 230- 0159 ( see Appendix IX
). Copies of all 
documents faxed to the NCI  must also be emailed to the ADVL1411 COG Study Assi gned 
Research Coordinator. The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational 
agent should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS  
report.  
 
 
13.7.1  Pregnancy  
• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
occurring on study or within 6 months following the last dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP- AERS  as 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (Pregnancy) 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL1411  
03/23/17  
 
 
74 
 
under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC and 
reported as Grade 3. 
 
• Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is known at intervals 
deemed appropriate by her physicians. The “Pregnancy Information 
Form ” should be used for all follow -ups. If the baby is born with a birth 
defect or other anomaly, then a second CTEP-AERS report is required. 
 
13.7.2  Fetal Death  
• Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by death in 
utero; failure of the product o f conception to show evidence of respiration, 
heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation.”  
•  Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy,  
puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy loss)” under the  
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC.  
 
•  A fetal death should NOT be reported as “Fetal death,” a Grade 5 event  
under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC, as 
currently CTEP -AERS  recognizes this event as a patient death.  
 
13.7.3  Death Neonatal  
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by  
cessation of life occurring during the first 28 days of life” that is felt by  
the investigator to be at least possi bly due to the investigational  
agent/intervention, should be reported expeditiously.  
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “General 
disorders and administration- Other (neonatal loss)” under the General 
disorders and administration SOC.  
 
• Neonatal death should NOT be reported as “Death neonatal” under the General disorders and administration SOC, a Grade 5 event. If reported as such, the CTEP -AERS  interprets this as a death of the patient being 
treated.

14.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Data and safety is ensured by several integrated components including the COG Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee.  
 
14.4.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology Group 
policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase 1 and 2 studies. In brief, the role of 
the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee is to protect the interests of 
patients and the scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC 
consists of a chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one consumer representative; the lead statistician of the developmental therapy scientific committee; and a member from the NCI. The DSMC meets at least every 
6 months to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMC 
from other related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the 
Phase 1 and 2 DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for working with the study 
statistic ian to prepare study reports for review by the DSMC. The DSMC will 
provide recommendations to the COG Developmental Therapeutics Chair and the 
Group Chair for each study reviewed to change the study or to continue the study 
unchanged. Data and Safety Commi ttee reports for institutional review boards can 
be prepared using the public data monitoring report as posted on the COG Web site. 
 
14.4.2  Monitoring by the Study Chair and Developmental Therapeutics Leadership  
The study chair will monitor the study regularly a nd enter evaluations of patients’ 
eligibility, evaluability, and dose limiting toxicities into the study database. In addition, study data and the study chair’s evaluations will be reviewed by the Developmental Therapeutics Chair, Vice Chair and Statistician on a weekly 
conference call.

Determine the EPAP (baseline pressure) required to effectively wash out CO2 for current 
available masks, and assess perceived level of comfort with each mask with using noninvasive ventilator.
1- Abstract:
Background: Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) can be delivered via single limb circuit or double limb circuit ventilators. There are many advantages to NPPV. However, a reasonable number of questions remain unanswered, such as mask impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) clearance based on EPAP level.Objective: Determine the EPAP (baseline pressure) required to effectively wash out CO2 for each mask, and assess perceived level of comfort with each mask with ICU ventilator.Method: This study will be a randomized crossover trial that will be conducted at Rush University. The study will be conducted with 20 healthy volunteers who will be placed on ICU ventilator operating in the NIPPV mode. All subjects will perform 15 minutes of breathing on NIPPV on each mask of the 4 different masks (2 oronasal and 2 full face masks) that are randomly selected. Breathing through each mask will be followed by a 5-minute wash out period between masks. End tidal Carbon Dioxide (EtCO2) will be sampled nasal/oral. Different levels of EPAP will be set and CO2 clearance will be monitored. Additionally, subjective mask comfort will be assessed via visual analog scale (VAS) with 1 referring to least comfortable and 5 being the most comfortable.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a form of ventilatory support for 
spontaneously breathing patients without the need of an artificial airway.1 NIPPV is 
recommended for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation as well as cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
2 The use of NIPPV has reduced 
the need for intubation and improved mortality.2 Some studies have demonstrated a 
decrease in mortality rate in individuals with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and immunosuppression with the use of NIPPV.
2 Issues that exist with NIPPV is patient 
compliance or tolerance.3 NIPPV failure rates can exceed 40%. Mask intolerance remains 
a major hindrance to NIPPV success.3,4 
NIPPV uses external interfaces such as nasal mask, facial mask, mouthpiece, or helmet.1 
Noninvasive ventilation (NIPPV) can be delivered by a dedicated NIPPV ventilator which utilizes a single limb circuit requiring an expiratory port to allow for carbon dioxide clearance. This NIPPV ventilator has the ability to adjust for leak and continue to function properly without the mask fitting tightly to the face.
3,4 NIPPV can also be 
delivered by ICU ventilators which utilize a dual limb circuit and these circuits usually have no leak to properly function. NIPPV interface fitting is another key factor, however, to minimize leak the interface may be over tighten and cause patients discomfort. Patients may complain of NIPPV due to multiple factors, it can be facial discomfort, massive air leak or pressure sores.
5 It has reported that oronasal mask to perform worse with pain at 
nose bridge in comparison to total face mask.6 While cheeks’ pain was more prevalent in 
the oronasal mask in comparison to total face mask7, oronasal dryness and claustrophobic 
were reported higher with total face mask.6 It is fair to state that success of NIPPV is 
dependent on many factors, one of them is mask characteristics.8 These issues may ORA: 18011502-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 3/30/2018   Amendment Date: 5/11/2018
decrease patient tolerance of NIPPV.5 A properly fit mask may increase patient 
compliance. Moreover, health care providers (HCPs) must have an excellent understanding of NIPPV and the skills to execute the task successfully.
5 However, a 
concern remains that a single limb circuit with NIPPV ventilators may cause carbon dioxide (CO
2) rebreathing.9 This CO2 rebreathing can lead to NIPPV failure.
  Samolski et al, studied the CO2 rebreathing while using a portable ventilator 
which uses a single limb circuit. They studied the effect of expiratory port location, different sites of the port (i.e. in the mask, before the mask), and the addition of dead space between the circuit and mask on CO2 rebreathing. They found no CO2 rebreathing, and baseline pressure as low as 4 cm H2O was effective in preventing CO2 rebreathing.
9 
However, this study has limitations. First, they used three different nasal masks and 2 different facial masks. Currently there are newer masks available that need testing. Last, they measured fraction of inspired CO2 (FiCO2) via a sampling line located in the mask.
9 
The site of sampling can significantly affect the accuracy of end tidal CO2 (EtCO2) measurement. Sampling line at the oral/nasal site may be the most reliable sampling site for EtCO2 and determining rebreathing of exhaled gas. 
NIPPV interface choice is crucial to achieve a good clinical outcome with the use 
of NIPPV. Common interfaces are nasal mask which covers the nose only, facial mask known as oronasal mask which covers the nose and mouth. Total face mask and helmet are gaining popularity. Generally, nasal mask is better tolerated, while oronasal mask is more effective for improving gas exchange. The perfect mask should be lightweight, comfortable, easy to apply, transparent in color, latex-free, have small internal volume and low airflow resistance.

The total face mask which covers the entire face was designed with the aim of 
enhancing patient tolerance. Newer generation of NIPPV full face masks are available on the market (e.g. PerforMax) which also covers the eyes, nose, and mouth. The mask also, has advantages by minimizing gas leakage. Furthermore, due to its shape, it helps to minimize pressure sores on the face as there is no contact with the nose bridge. On the other hand, the mask has disadvantages such as adding a large dead space, which varies from mask to mask based on different manufacturers. Unlike the larger older generation, this mask comes without the two orifices for CO2 washout.
3,6 To accommodate both 
types of ventilators (NIPPV and ICU ventilators) this mask comes with two options of an elbow, a standard elbow for use with double circuit ICU ventilators or an entrainment elbow for NIPPV ventilators.
3 It is worth mentioning that the total face mask costs more 
than the nasal mask or oronasal mask.10 Despite total face mask’s large internal volume, 
the mask doesn’t affect patients’ gas exchange during short term of NIPPV using ICU ventilator.

 NIPPV masks were developed with an intentional leak to remove CO 2 from the 
interface.8 A comparison of three different masks (mask A, mask B, mask C) on healthy 
volunteers to investigate CO 2 wash out hypothesized that in NIPPV masks with lower 
rates of intentional leaks, CO 2 rebreathing might occur. 8 Transcutaneous capnography 
(PtcCO 2) was measured. IPAP level of 14 cm H2O, EPAP of 4 cm H2O was applied to 
all masks. Each subject was placed on NIPPV, and tried all three masks consecutively. Each mask was tested for 10 minutes followed by 5 minutes break in between masks. They found no differences in PtcCO
2 between masks. 8 Despite accuracy of PtcCO 2 
measurement, this study has some limitations. It did not assess CO 2 clearance at the mask ORA: 18011502-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 3/30/2018   Amendment Date: 5/11/2018
via EtCO 2. Masks B & C both had higher rate of total leaks due to higher rate of 
unintentional leaks which may improved CO 2 wash out, hence, led to no differences in 
PtcCO 2. 8 Another study compared total face mask against oronasal mask impact on gas 
exchange (PvCO 2) favors total face mask in the first 6 hours and during the acute phase 
of respiratory failure using NIPPV.7 Both Medrinal and Sadeghi assessed gas exchange 
not masks’ CO 2 clearance. Since the intentional leak impacts CO 2 clearance, and the 
intentional leak level depends on the level of pressure. 8 The previous studies didn’t study 
different level of EPAP (baseline pressure). One level of EPAP pressure of 4 cm H2O was used in Medrinal study based on Samolski’s finding.
 8 While in Sadeghi’s study, 
IPAP started at 10 cm H2O and EPAP started at 4 cm H2O. IPAP and EPAP were increased gradually based on subjects’ need, therefore it lacked consistency in EPAP level.
9
 ICU ventilators using double limb circuit is an alternative to deliver NIPPV, however, researches on minimum baseline pressure required to prevent CO2 rebreathing is not clear as well. In a study that compared 3 types of masks (2 ONM and 1 FFM) to helmet in acute hypercapnia respiratory failure. NIPPV in both group improved arterial blood gases. ICU ventilators settings in masks group used positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) referring to baseline pressure that ranged from 3 – 5 cm H2O (mean 4.26 ± 1.92); and inspiratory pressure adjusted to achieve tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg (16.37 ± 4.19). On the other hand, settings for helmet groups were ~ 30%.

The answer regarding effective EPAP level to wash out CO 2 remains uncertain. 
The purpose of this study is  to compare the efficacy of CO 2 clearance between different 
NIPPV interfaces (oronasal and full face masks) when using double limb circuit ICU ORA: 18011502-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 3/30/2018   Amendment Date: 5/11/2018
ventilator at lower levels of EPAP. The aim of this study is to determine the EPAP 
(baseline pressure) required to effectively wash out CO 2 for each mask and assess 
perceived level of comfort with each mask.ORA: 18011502-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 3/30/2018   Amendment Date: 5/11/2018
3- Methods :
This study will be a randomized crossover trial that will be conducted at Rush University. Normal volunteers will be recruited from Rush University Medical Centers. Volunteers will be screened with inclusion and exclusion criteria and an informed consent is required in order for them to participate. Demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) will be obtained. Also, initial baseline vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) will be obtained. EtCO
2 will be obtained at baseline and periodically using an 
oral/nasal sample line with the CapnostreamTM 20p monitor (Medtronic, Minneapolis, 
MN). The study will use a double limb circuit ICU ventilator Puritan Bennett™ (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). 
We will evaluate 4 NIPPV masks (2 oronasal masks and 2 full face masks). 
Oronasal masks will be labeled as group A and numbered as A1 and A2; while full face masks will be labeled group B and numbered as B1 and B2. Order of the masks will be randomly chosen in two steps. First steps will be choosing A or B then randomly assign mask in each of these groups. We will randomly assign mask in group A or B by drawing an initial mask from the group and then continue the sequence of masks from that point. For example, we randomly chose group A, then randomly chose A2, the sequence will be A2, A1. Then we would randomly choose B2, then the sequence would be B2, B1. 
All subjects will perform 15 minutes on each mask followed by 5 minutes wash 
out interval between masks. EPAP levels will be 0, 2, 4, & 5 while IPAP remains at 5 higher than EPAP. EtCO2 will be collected at 4:00, 4:30 and 5:00 minute mark. These three measures should differ by less than 20% of their average.  Also, subjective mask ORA: 18011502-IRB01   Date IRB Approved: 3/30/2018   Amendment Date: 5/11/2018
comfort will be assessed via visual analog scale (VAS) with 1 referring to least 
comfortable and 5 being the most comfortable after 5 each EPAP setting. Procedure figure:

3. INTRODUCTION
As per Internatio nal Conference on Harmonisation E9 (ICH E9 )the purpose of this document 
is to provide a more technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features of the anal ysis 
described in the protocol, and to include detailed procedures for executing the statistical 
analysis of the primary  and secondar y variables and other data.
This Trial Statistical Analy sis Plan ( TSAP )assumes familiarity  with the Clinical Trial 
Protocol (CTP), including Protocol Amendments. In particular, the TSAP is based on the 
planned anal ysis specification as written in CTP Sec tion 7 “Statistical Methods and 
Determination of Sample Size”. Therefore, TSAP readers may consult the CTP for more 
background information on the study , e.g. on study  objectives, study  design and population, 
treatments and definition of measurements and va riables.
The study  was initially planned to be a single arm, open label trial consisting of two parts: a 
Phase Ib do se escalation partand a P hase II part investigating one expansion cohort . 
Approximately  60 chronic ly mphocy tic leuk aemia ( CLL )patients who qualify  for treatment 
with ibrutinib were to be treated with a combination of BI 836826 and ibrutinib in this trial. 
Approximately  20 patients were intended to be enrolled in Phase Ib and 40 patients were
intended to be enrolled in the Phase II part of this study .
Dose -escalation of BI 836826 is guided b y a Ba yesian L ogistic Regression Model (BLRM) 
with overdose control. The BLRM estimates the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD) by updating 
estimates of the probability  of observing a dose limiting toxicity  (DLT ) in the MTD 
evaluation period for each dose level in the study  as patient information becomes available. At 
any time in the trial, it isnot permitted to escalate to a dose which does not fulfil the 
escalation with overdose c ontrol (EWOC) criterion . Dose -increments are≤100% of the 
previous dose level tested in the previous cohort.
Due to the strategical decision to stop the project, the Phase II part of the trial will not be 
conducted. Therefore, this TSAP only  describes the anal ysis of t he Phase Ib part of the trial , 
based on CTP amendment 1 which reflects this change in the study  set-up. The decision was 
made that an abbreviated clinical trial report (CTR) will be written for this trial instead of a 
full CTR. Therefore, only anal yses mandatory  to be reported and additional analy ses deemed 
necessary  by the trial are described in this TSAP and will be included in the abbreviated CTR. 
In the following , study  medication alway s refers to either BI 836826 or ibrutinib.
SAS® Version 9.4 or hi gher will be used for all analy ses.

5. ENDPOINTS
5.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINTS
The primary  endpoints of the trial are: 
Recommended Phase II dose ( RP2D)of BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib. I f a 
MTD can be determined based on the criteria as described in Section 7 of the CTP, the 
RP2D will be either the MTD or a lower dose. The RP2D will be determined by the 
safet y review committee ( SRC) based on safet y and efficacy  considerations .
Number of patients with DL Ts during the 
MTD evaluation period (starting at the day  
of first administration of BI 836826, la sting until 14 day s after the Day  15 
administration of BI 836826 in the first cy cle)
For definition of DLT, refer to CTP Section 5.3.6.2.
5.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
5.2.1 Key secondary endpoints
Not applicable.
5.2.2 Other s econdary endpoints
The secondary  endpoint is the MTD. T he MTD may  be considered reached if the posterior 
probability  that the true DL T rate is in the target in terval [0.16, 0.33) is large r than 0.5 or if at 
least 15 patients have been treated in the Phase Ib part, of which at least 6 at the MTD. 
Patients who have been replaced are not considered evaluable for MTD determination. Only  
DLTs occurring in the MTD evaluation period will be considered for the determination of the 
MTD

6. GENERAL ANALYSIS DEF INITIONS
6.1 TREATMENTS
In this trial, treatments are not randomized (open -label , dose -escalation ). Different dose levels 
of BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib are being administered. All planned anal yses will 
be presented b y initial treatment group , i.e. for all dose cohorts separatel
yand in total over all 
dose cohorts .
To justify  the RP2D / MTD determination, DLTs occurring during the MTD evaluation 
period will be presented separately  from those occurring during the whole on -treatment 
period. Patients w here treatment group assignment has not been followed will be han dled on a 
case-by-case basis 
and will be agreed upon latest atthereport planning meeting before 
database lock.
For safet y summaries events that start from firstadministration of BI 836826 and last until 30 
days (residual effect period (REP)) after the last administration of BI 836826 will be 
considered as having occurred “on treatment”. If not specified otherwise, all safet y tables will 
be based on the on -treatment period. AEs that have an onset date during the screening , run-in,
or post -study  period will be display ed in separate listings from those occurred during the on -
treatment period (refer to Section 7.8.1.2 for details) . 
Labels of each anal ysis treatment period, anal ysis numbers, the labels used for display s in the 
tables and listings in the CTR, as well as codes, decodes, sort order and labels for each trial 
medication are provided in the TSAP technical document analysis dataset ( ADS )plan. 
6.2 IMPORTANT PROTOCOL V IOLATIONS
No per protocol set analysis will be performed for this study , hence no patient will be 
excluded from the anal yses. However, patients with important protocol violations (I PVs) will 
be documented. The following table defines the different categories of IPVs.

6.3 PATIENT SETS ANALYSE D
The Screened Set (SCR) includes all patients who signed the informed consent form and will 
be used to summarize patient disposition.
The Run- In Set (RIS) includes all patients who received at least one dose of ibrutinib . The 
RIS will be used for the analysis of exposure to ibrutinib. 
The Treated Set (TS): consists of all patients who received at least one administration ofBI 
836826 . The TS will be used for all planned safet y and efficacy anal yses.
The MTD evaluation set: This patient set includes all patients who were documented to have 
received at least one dose of BI 836826 and were not replaced for the MTD evaluation. The 
MTD evaluation set will be used for the primary  analy ses of DLTs and MTD determination.

Rules for replacement of patients are defined in Section 3.3.4.1 of the CTP. The list of 
replaced patients will be provided by  the Trial Clinic al Monitor (TCM) no later than the last 
blinded report planning meeting ( BRPM) and will be stored in the TMF .
 
6.5 POOLING OF CENTRES
This section is n ot applicable since there will not be an y inferential statistical anal ysis. Thus, 
no statistical model in which centre o r country  is included as factor is applied.
6.6 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA AND OUTLIERS
Missing or incomplete AE dates are imputed according t o BI standards ( 3).
In general, missing data not discussed in ( 3) will not be imputed unless required for the 
following analy ses and definitions. Then the rules as described below apply .
1)Change of laboratory values from baseline
Laboratory  values at baseline: For missing laboratory  data at visit 1 (before the first 
administration of BI 836826) the data of preceding visits will be used. 
2)Definition of on -treatment period and actual treatment 
Date of permanent discontinuation of last study  medication: All reasonable efforts 
should be undertaken during the stud y to obtain the dates of permanent 
discontinuation of last study medication. However, if the date of the very  last 
administration is missing this will be i mputed with:
If only  month and y ear are given, the last day  of the month will be used for 
imputation
If only  the y ear is given, the 31stof December of this y ear will be used for 
imputation
If the imputed date leads to a date that is later than the date of theend of treatment
(EOT) visit, then the imputed date is the date of the EOT visit. If the imputed date 
leads to a date that is later than the death date, then the imputed date is the date of 
death.

6.7 BASELINE, TIME WINDO WS AND CALCULATED VI SITS
Study  days and visits will be labelled according to the flow chart of the CTP.
Unless otherwise specified, baseline is defined as the time -point closest to but prior to first 
administration of BI 836826. If no time is specified and the date is the same as the first
administration date, then it will still be considered baseline if not specified otherwise.
Laboratory  values: Baseline is defined as the latest time -point before the very  first 
administration of BI 836826. For laboratories where not onl y the examination date but also 
time are re corded, examination time has to be taken into account when defining baseline. That 
is, a laboratory  value on the same date as the first administration of BI 836826 is considered 
as baseline value if and only
 if the time of laborato ry value is before or the same as the time 
of BI 836826 administration.

7. PLANNED ANALYSIS
For End -Of-Text tables, the set of summary  statistics is: N / Mean / standard deviation (StD) / 
Min / Median / Max. For tables that are provided for endpoints with som e extreme data, 
median, quartiles and percentiles should be preferred to mean, StD, min ,and max. Efficacy  
data are presented b y dose cohort. Display s of safety  data will be presented by  dose cohort 
and in total. 
For time -to-event anal ysis tables, the set of statistics is: number of patients [N(%)], Number 
of patients with event [N(%)], <Time to event> [months] followed by  P25 (25thpercentile), 
median, P75 (75thpercentile), Number of patients censored [N(%)]. If not specified otherwise, 
the duration as w ell as the time to event will be display ed in day s.
If not otherwise specified, the abbreviation Pxx should be used for display ing the xxth
percentile. 
Tabulations of frequencies for categorical data will include all possible categories and will 
display  the number of observations in a category  as well as the percentage (%) relative to the 
respective treatment group (unless otherwise specified, all patients in the respective patient set 
whether they  have non
-missing values or not). Percentages will be roun ded to one decimal 
place. The category  missing will be display ed onl y if there are actuall y missing values. The 
denominator of the main categories is defined b y the number of patients in the used patient 
set. The main categories define the denominators of the subcategories. Subcategories should 
be intended and “[N(%)]” will be display ed only  for the main category . If a table includes 
only categorical data, “[N(%)]” is to be display ed in the column header.
Abbreviations (e.g. Wors.) should not be display ed w ithout any  explanations. They  will be 
either spelled out in the table or explained in footnotes (whatever is more reasonable from the 
programming point of view).
If applicable, conversion from day s to weeks, months and y ears will be as follows:
Weeks = Day s/7
Months = (Day s ×12)/365.25
Years = Day s/365.25
7.1 DEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHE R BASELINE CHARACTER ISTICS
Descriptive statistics are planned for this section.
7.1.1 Disposition of patients
For patient disposition the standard descriptive table will be populated. Additionally , patients 
with discontinuations by  initial treatment and the reasons will be listed. An overview table 
with respect to analy sis sets (as defined in Section 6.3) will be provided.
7.1.2 Important protocol violations
The number of p atients with important protocol violations will be display ed.
Boehringer Ingelheim
TSAP for BI Trial No: 1270.15 Page 23of 34
Proprietary confidential information © 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
7.1.3 Demographic and other baseline characteristics
Standard descriptive analy sis and summary  tables for all patients treated by initial treatment 
will be created for demograph y, oncology  history, virology , phy sical examination (including 
constitutional sy mptoms), eastern cooperative oncology  group ( ECOG
) performance score ,
tumour size, previous therapies and previous stem cell transplantations
.
7.2 CONCOMITANT DISEASES AND MEDICATION
Descriptive statistics are planned for this section of the report.
Concomitant diseases will be coded similarl y as adverse events based on the most current 
MedDRA version. Concomitant therapies (CTh) will be coded according to the World Health 
Organisation Drug Dictionary  (WHO DD). They  will be classified according to the 
Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical (ATC) classification sy stem . The third ATC level will be 
used to categorise CThs by  therapy  type. In situations where a medical product may be used 
for more than one equally important indication, there are often several classification 
alternatives. As appropriate, patients receiving CThs with more than one possible ATC level-
three category  will be counted more than once; footnotes will clarify  this possible double 
counting in tables.
Summaries will be presented for previous and concomitant medications started at baseline and 
for conc omitant therapies started after first administration of BI 836826 . Transfusions will be 
display ed separatel y.
7.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
Compliance will be evaluated b y whether or not the medication was always administered 
according to protocol for BI 836826.
For patients where the infusion schedule was not followed a listing with comments will be 
presented.
Furthermore, a listing will show all administrations of BI 836826 including also the 
administration of premedicati on Analgesic/Antip yretic, Glucoc orticoid and Antihistamine as 
well as the dose changes and interruptions of ibrutinib .
7.4
PRIMARY ENDPOINTS
The primary  endpoint sarethe RP2D and the number of patients with DLTs in the MTD 
evaluation period . The number of patients with DLTs at each dose level will b e presented for 
the MTD evaluation period for the MTD evaluation set and for the whole on -treatment period 
forthe treated set separately .
The RP2D will either be the MTD or a nylower dose, examined based on safet y and efficacy 
criteria. The anal ysis of t he MTD is based on a BLRM guided b y the EWOC principle. 
Estimation of the MTD during the dose escalation phase of the stud y will be based upon the 
estimation of the posterior probability  of the incidence of DLT in toxicity  categories during 
the MTD evaluation period for all evaluable patients. The model to be used is specified in 
CTP Section 7.
Boehringer Ingelheim
TSAP for BI Trial No: 1270.15 Page 24of 34
Proprietary confidential information © 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
The posterior probabilities that the toxicity  rates of each dose level fall into the categories 
specified in CTP Section 7 estimated from the BLRM will be display edgraphically  as well as 
in a table . This will be done for the MTD evaluation period as well as for the complete on -
treatment period.
7.5
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
7.5.1 Key secondary endpoints
Not applicable.
7.5.2 Other Secondary endpoints
The secondary  endpoint is the MTD. This will analy sed analogously  to the primary  endpoint 
RP2D. Only  patients evaluable for MTD determination will be used for the anal ysisof the 
MTD , i.e. p atients, if an y, who were replaced during the MTD evaluation period will be 
excluded from the anal ysis of the MTD.

7.7 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE
Standard descriptive analy ses over all treatment courses will be performed. This will include a 
summary  of the variables already  described in Section 5.4.2 . This descriptive anal ysis will
comprise a mixture of frequencies and percentages, as well as summary  statistics.
7.8 SAFETY ANALYSIS
If not specified otherwise, all safety analyses will be performed on the treated set.
7.8.1 Adverse events
7.8.1.1 Maximum tolerated dose / RP2D and dose limiting toxicity
A summary  of the number of patients with DLT s within the MTD evaluation period will be 
display ed for the MTD evaluation set. This table will also be created for all treatment courses 
of the on- treatment period by  initial treatment for the treated se t .
Patients who were replaced within the MTD evaluation period will be excluded from the 
determination of the MTD but will be considered for all other safet y evaluations. A listing of 
replace d patients will be provided . 
Refer to Section 7.4 for more details on the analysis of the MTD and the RP2D.
7.8.1.2 Adverse events
Unless otherwise s pecified, adverse events analy ses will be performed for theon-treatment 
period. Select ed anal yses will be repeated for the MTD evaluation period and for the run -in 
period. 
The anal yses of AEs will be descriptive in nature and will follow the standard procedure laid 
down in ( 4). All anal yses of AEs will be based on the number of patients with AEs and NOT 
on the number of AEs.
AEs will be coded with the most recent version of MedDRA .The version number will be 
display ed as a footnote in the respective tables and listings. The severit y of AEs will be scaled 
accordi ng to CTCAE version 4.0.

The sy stem organ classes (SOCs) will be sorted alphabeticall y. In tables displaying AEs b y 
dose cohort ,preferred terms (PTs) will be sorted by descending frequency  of adverse events 
in the “Total” BI 836826 group.
Each patient ca n be observed during the trial under several doses. Anal ysing the AE sof all 
treatment courses will be carried out under the initial treatment. No formal statistical analy sis 
is planned for the safet y comparison. 
The anal ysis of AEs will be based on the c oncept of treatment emergent AEs. That means that 
all AE s occurring from the first administration of BI 836826 until 30 day safter last 
administration of BI 836826 will be assigned to the on -treatment period. All AEs occurring 
before first administration o f any trial medication will be assigned to “Screening” , all AEs 
occurring after the first administration of ibrutinib and before the first administration of BI 
836826 will be assigned to “Run- in”and all AEs occurring after last administration of BI 
836826 + 30 day swill be assigned to “P ost-study ”(for listings onl y). The actual planned 
dosage of BI 836826 and ibrutinib administered on the day  each AE starts will also be derived 
and will be included in the listing. L istings of screening events will not be sorted by  initial 
treatment. Post -study  listings will be sorted b y initial treatment. For details on the treatment 
definition please refer to Section 6.1.
According to the BI standards, multiple recordings of AEs will be collapse d to episodes on 
the lowest level term and multiple episodes will be condensed to records on the PT and SOC 
level. CTCAE grade will be an additional criterion for collapsing and condensing AEs. The 
maximum CTCAE grade will be assigned to episodes and recor ds. CTCAE grade and DLT 
information will be display ed in AE listings. MedDRA levels for condensing will be SOC and 
PT.
An overall summary  of adverse events will be presented.
Reporting of CTCAE grades : 
CTCAE grading within AE tables in Section 15 of the CTR is display ed as “all Grades”, 
“missing Grade”, “Grade 1”, “Grade 2”, “Gr ade 3”, “Grade 4” and “Grade 5” , but the 
“missing grade” column should only  be display ed in case AEs with a missing CTCAE grade 
occurred. A separate table wil l show AEs leading to death. In this table no CTCAE grades 
will be shown. 
Frequencies of patients with AEs will be summarised by treatment, highest CTCAE grade, 
primary  SOC and PT. Tables will be provided for patients with drug -related AEs, with serious 
AEs (SAEs), with drug -related SAEs, with AEs leading to discontinuation of last study  
medication (i.e. leading to discontinuation of the last administered study  medication) , with 
AEs leading to discontinuation of BI 836826, with AEs leading to discontinuati on of 
ibrutinib , with AEs leading to dose reduction of BI 836826, with AEs leading to dose 
reduction of inbrutinib, with protocol -specified AEs of special interest (AESI) , and with AEs 
leading to death .

7.8.2 Laboratory data
The anal yses of laboratory  data will be descriptive in nature and will follow the standard 
procedure laid down in (2).  Patients will be counted under the initial treatment. The anal ysis 
of laboratory  data will use the same ‘anal ysing treatments’ as described for the AEs, except 
for that the baseline laboratory  value (as defined in Section 6.7) will be included in the ‘on 
treatment’ period. Patients having at least one post -baseline laboratory  value will be display ed 
in the descriptive analy ses. Patients with missing CTCAE grade at baseline or no baseline 
value but with post- baseline laboratory values will be display ed in the category  “Missing 
CTCAE grade at baseline” .
Single time courses by initial treatmen t will be used to display  normalized laboratory  values 
over time by  dose cohort. The graphs may  be truncated if sufficient data is not available. 
These graphs will be display ed in Section 16.1.13.1 of the CTR for the following parameters, 
using the BI norm alised values for haematology  and differentials, and the multiples of the 
ULN for enzy mes.
Haematology : haemoglobin, white blood cell count 
Differentials: absolute lymphocy te count
Enzy mes: LDH
Descriptive statistics, including change from baseline, frequ ency  of patients with transitions 
relative to the references range, will be provided. No post -study  laboratory values will be 
considered. CTCAE grade for applicable laboratory  parameters will be calculated according 
to CTCAE v4.0. The following outputs wil
l be presented:
Worst CTCAE grade experienced during the on -treatment period
Transitions of the CTCAE grade from baseline to the worst lab values, from baseline to 
the last lab values, and from the worst to last values during the on -treatment period
Possib le clinically  significant laboratory  values
Note: For calculating the change in CTCAE grade from baseline, patients with a CTCAE 
grade of -9 (no CTCAE grade defined) will be treated as a CTCAE grade 0 for all anal yses. In 
laboratory  listings, the CTCAE gr ade is display ed as -9.
For Uric Acid and Hy pokalemia, the CTCAE grade cannot alway s be assigned by the 
laboratory  parameter itself as two different CTCAE grades have the same laboratory  
constellation, but are distinguished b y additional clinical parameter. In this case a CTCAE 
grade of -1 will be assigned initi ally. Patients with a CTCAE grade of -1 will be treated as
Grade 1 for Uric Acid
Grade 1 for Hy pokalemia
for all anal yses. In laboratory  listings, the CTCAE grade will be display ed as -1.

The prioritized laboratory values (see Section 5.4.5 ) will be display ed in Sec tion 15 of the 
final CTR while all other laboratory  parameters will be display ed in the Appendix of the 
CTR.
Patients with hepatic enzyme elevation will be tabulated ( drug-induced liver injury  (DILI )
supporting table). In addition, a separate listing will be presented giving patients with missing 
parameter in the given time frame. 
For potential Hy ’s law cases, possible clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  values and 
cases of TLS frequency  tables will be provided.

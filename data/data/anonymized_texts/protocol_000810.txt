Invitation to Participate and Description of Project 
 
You are invited to take part in a research study because you have clinical stage I -III, HER2 -
positve breast cancer that may benefit from preoperative chemotherapy. Th e main goal of this 
clinical trial is to test if adding a new drug, pertuzumab (Perjeta) , improves the anticancer 
activity of the currently most effective treatment that includes trastuzumab (Herceptin) given 
together with chem otherapy  (paclitaxel, 5 -fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) . The 
study will also test the safety of this therapy . If you agree to participate , you will receive 6 
months of chemotherapy concomitant with trastuzumab and pertuzumab before surgery . 
Subsequently, you will undergo surgery to remove any cancer from your breast and axillary 
lymph nodes that may have survived the chemotherapy.  
 This clinical trial represents experimental therapy because pertuzumab is not approved by the US Food and Drug  administration to  be given concomitant with epirubicin. Several clinical studies 
demonstrated that when pertuzumab is given together with chemotherapy and/or trastuzuma b the 
combination treatment has greater anti -cancer effect than any of the drugs alone which provides 
the rationale for our study . All treatments other than pertuzumab that you will receive during this 
clinical trial are standard of care.  
 Up to 64 subjects  will take part in this study.  
 
In order to decide whether or not you wish to be a part of this research study you should know 
enough about its risks and benefits to make an informed decision.  This consent form gives you detailed information about the study, which a member of the resear ch team will discuss with you.  
This discussion should go over all aspects of this research: its purpose, the procedures that will be performed, any  risks of the procedures, possible benefits and possible alternative treatments.

Description of Procedures 
 Tests and procedures that would be performed for your care whether you are on this study or not are referred to as “standard of care.” All of the tests and procedures listed below that will be 
performed at your study visits should you choose to participate are considered to be standard of care.   
 If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to do the following: 
 
Before you  begin the study …   
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study.  These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and would be done even if you do not join the study.  If you have h ad some of them recently, the y may not need to be 
repeated; t his will depend of the date of the exam.  
• Medical history and  complete physical exam including your breast s and regional lymph 
nodes. 
• Bilateral mammograms and ultrasonogram of the regional lymph nodes  if clinically 
suspicious. During these exams a marker clip will need to be placed  in the breast to 
identify the cancer for surgery .
  
• CT scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis  and bone scan or PET -CT may be needed to 
assess if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes. Your physician will decide if you need these tests or not.  
• Routine laboratory blood tests to measure your blood counts and your kidney and liver 
function and electrolytes in your blood. 
• Assessment of your heart function through a nuclear  scan or echocardiography. 
• Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. 
 
Tests d uring the study …  
If the above assessment shows that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then you 
will need the following tests and procedures.  All of these are part of regular cancer care.  
• Before each chemotherapy you will need to have a test called complete blood count to 
check the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in  your blood. This 
will be done once a week during weekly treatments and once every 3 weeks during every 
3-week treatments (see section below on treatment) . Results from this test will determine 
if you can receive chemotherapy on that day or a treatment needs to be delayed. 
• Every 3 weeks during treatment you will have a clinic visit with your physician who will 
review your medical history and perform physical exam ination.

completion of all chemotherapy and every 3 months thereafter for a total of 12 months  (5 
heart studies total) using the same method as used before treatment started.  
• Repeat laboratory blood tests to measure kidney and liver function every 3 weeks during 
your therapy .

therapy is completed and at the completion of all chemotherapy before surgery. 
 
Your treatment during this study…..  
 This is a single arm , Phase II  clinical trial which means that all women will receive the same 
treatment  and the goal of the study is to determine how well this treatment work s to eradicate 
cancer from your breast (and lymph nodes) . The total duration of treatment is 24 weeks. During 
the first 12 weeks (weeks 1 -12) you will receive paclitaxel (also called Taxol) chemotherapy 
once weekly x 12 treatments concomitant with weekly trastuzumab (also called  Herceptin)  as 
well as pertuzumab (also called Perjeta) given once every 3 weeks. Durin g the second 12 weeks 
(weeks 13-24), you will receive  5- fluorouracil  (also called 5FU), epirubicin (also called Ellence ) 
and cyclophosphamide (also called Cytoxan)  concomitant with trastuzumab and pertuzumab 
each given once every 3 weeks (21 days) for 4 t reatments . 
 
The duration of each treatment session lasts between 1.5 – 3.0 hours.  All drugs in this study are 
given through a needle in your vein (intravenously) . You will need to have a central venous 
access, a catheter or port inserted in a large vein, in order to receive therapy. You and your physician will decide together what catheter is most convenient for you.  The exact dose and schedule of your treatment is included in the table below.

Page 4 of 15  You will be given anti- nausea medications and additional medicines to reduce the risk of allergic 
reactions to drugs before each chemotherapy.  
 
After completion of all chemotherapy treatments … 
• You will have surgery to remove any cancer from the breast and regional lymph nodes. You 
and your surgeon will decide t ogether what the most appropriate surgery is for you. You may 
have your whole breast removed (mastectomy) or only parts of the br east that contained 
cancer (lumpectomy) . All patients will have sampling of the lymph nodes in the axilla (arm 
pit) during the breast surgery . 
After Surgery …  
• Your treatment after surgery will follow standard clinical practice. This includes completion of a total of 12 months of treatment with trastuzumab (including the 6 months before surgery) and patients with estrogen receptor positive cancer will also take anti -estrogen 
therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor drug) for 5-10 years.  Depending on the type of 
surgery that you had, you may also require radiation therapy to the breast and lymph node regions. After completion of all treatment, y our physician will continue to see you regularly 
every 3 months and your cardiac function will be monitored with repeat cardiac tests as part 
of routine care at month 9 and month 12.  
• Your medical records may be checked periodically in the future to find out your health status. 
You may also be contacted by the phone to find out about your health status as part of good 
clinical, practice.  
• After completion of your surger y you may opt to participate in other clinical studies.  
 
How long will I b e in the study?  
 
Your experimental treatment will last for 6 months  and then you will continue to be followed for 
an additional 6 months. Your participation in this study will last a total of 12 months.  
 
Can I stop being in the study?  
 
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the treating physician, your study doctor , if you 
are thinking about stopping or decide to stop.  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from stopping early can be discussed with you by your study doctor.  Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be 
most helpful for you.

  Risks and Inconveniences  
 You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious.  Your health care  team will give you medicines to help 
lessen side effects.  Many side effects go away soon after the completion of this experimental chemotherapy combination.  In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away.   You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.  This is very important to do, even if the side effects are occurring in between your visits with the study doctor, because if you are having side effects your c hemotherapy dose may be 
held or adjusted.  The most important side effect of this experimental therapy is increased risk for heart  damage 
due to the combined treatment with trastuzumab pertuzumab and epirubicin.   There is small risk (1 -2%) that your cancer m ay continue to grow despite treatment. You doctor 
will closely follow your cancer by physical exam and repeat mammogram or ultrasonogram if 
necessary . If the cancer grows, you will discontinue therapy and may undergo surgery to remove 
the cancer or  receive other treatment.  
 
Risks and side effects related to the paclitaxel treatment include the following:  
 
Likely (occurring in > 20% of patients) 
 
• Fatigue  
• Hair loss  
• Pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in hands and/or feet  
(neuropathy) .  These symptoms usually get better or go away without medication within 
3 weeks of stopping treatment.   
• You may get joint and muscle pain a few days after your treatment. These symptoms 
usually disappear in a few days. 
 
Less Likely (occurring in < 20% o f patients)  
 
• Nausea (feeling as if you’re about to throw up) or v omiting (throwing -up) 
• Low blood pressure 
• Shortness of breath

Irritation at the Chemotherapy Infusion Site :   
 Chemotherapy may cause irritation  and tissue damage at the site of injection .  These reactions 
are cau sed by the intravenous fluid that contains chemotherapy leaking into the surrounding area. 
Reactions may include  pain, redness, swelling of the surrounding skin or of the vein it self, and 
ulceration of the skin (open sores).  If you notice anything unusual  at the site of the injection 
(where the needle is inserted ), either during or after treatment, tell your nurse right away  who 
will notify your study doctor .

your blood pressure. Most of these events occur within 24 hours of infusion. However, delayed reactions have occurred. If a person experiences severe allergic  reaction, 
trastuzumab will be discontinued.  
• Interference with the pumping action of the heart leading to heart failure. The incidence of heart problems (heart failure) increase in people with heart disease or other risk factors such as radiat ion to the chest, advancing age, and use of other heart-toxic drugs (such as 
epirubicin and cyclophosphamide).  Your doctor will check your heart function before 
you start taking Trastuzumab and will monitor your heart closely during your treatment.   Trast uzumab will be discontinued if symptoms of heart failure appear.

Other instructions  
 
Tell your study doctor about all of your medicines.  Include prescription medicines, over the 
counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal products.  Some medicines can react with the  study drugs 
that you receive and may cause serious side effects.   Keep a list of your medicines, and show it to your study doctor or pharmacist.  Talk to your study doctor before starting any new medicines.     
Reproductive risks:  
 
You should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study  or within six months  from 
completion of treatment because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby and cause serious birth defects.    Women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study.  It is important you understand that you need to use birth control while on this study.    Check with your  study doctor about what kind of birth control methods to  use and how long to 
use them.  If you become pregnant while participating in this study, inform your study doctor 
immediately.  
 For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

Risks associated with p rocedures during this study:  
 
This study does not involve any special procedures. Placement of either an intravenous (IV) line 
or port-o- cath for chemotherapy administration is part of routine care and are very safe 
procedure s.  However, t here is a slight chance that multiple needle- sticks may be necessary to 
make sure the IV is placed correctly.  You might feel a small amount of pain when the IV is 
placed but it does not last very long.  A bruise or an infection might develop where the IV is placed.  A bruise will go away by itself and it might help if you wrap a warm towel around your arm.  Infections can also be treated with outpatient antibiotics but rarely they  may require 
hospital admission . Rarely a blood clot may develop in the vein where the intravenous line is 
placed .   
 
Benefits  
 
This treatment combination may make your cancer completely disappear from your breast ( and 
lymph nodes) and could improve your chance for cure. During this clinical trial you will receive 
the currently most effective chemotherapy for HER2 positive breast cancer (trastuzumab concomitant with paclitaxel, 5 fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and epirubicin) and in addition 
you will also receive a new HER2 targeted drug, pertuzumab.   While doctors hope this chemotherapy combination will be more useful against cancer compared to the best current treatment, there is no proof of this yet.    We hope the information learned from this study will benefit other patients with breast cancer in the future.  
 
Economic Considerations  
 
You and/or your health plan/ insurance company will need to pay for the routine standard of care portions of your treatment. Some health plans will not pay these costs for people taking part in studies.  Check with your health plan or insurance company to find out what they will pay for.  Taking part in this study may or may not cost your insurance company more than the cost of getting regular ca ncer treatment.  
 
Pertuzumab (the only experimental part of your treatment) and trastuzumab will be provided by 
Genentech, Inc free of charge. The chemotherapy drugs  paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and 
cyclophosphamide are commercially available and considered standard of care and will be 
charged to you or your insurance company .  The research requires that you receive certain 
standard medical tests and examinations.  These standard tests and examinations will be charged 
in the usual way, to your insurance company.  You will not be paid for taking part in this study.

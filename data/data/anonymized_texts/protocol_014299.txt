 4   1.  RATIONALE AND STUDY OBJECTIVE   
Fluoride toothpaste is the most widely used form of fluoride delivery worldwide. Fluoride 
dentifrices have shown in numerous clinical trials to be effective anticaries agents and have been the subject of several systematic quantitative evaluations (Marinho et al., 2003; 
Twetman et al., 2003), which provide the highest standard of evidence for the effectiveness of fluoride dentifrice. Marinho et al. (2003) based their conclusions on a meta- analysis of 70 
trials of the effectiveness of fluoride dentifrice for  the prevention of dental caries in children 
compared to placebo. They found evidence that the use of fluoride dentifrices has a caries -
inhibiting effect (average reduction in Decay, Missing, and Filled Surfaces (DMFS) of 24%) on the permanent dentition. I n addition , they concluded that the effectiveness of fluoride 
dentifrice may be relatively greater in individuals with a higher caries experience, with 
increased fluoride concentration, increased frequency of use, and with supervised brushing. 
There was no evidence that the effect was dependent on background exposure to fluoridated 
water. Twetman et al. (2003) reached similar overall conclusions from their systematic review.  
The current levels of fluoride dentifrice products that are marketed worldwide generally fall in the range between 1000– 1500 ppm F , although dentifrices with lower fluoride 
concentrations are marketed in some countries . All fluoride toothpastes sold in the US are  
in the 1000- 1100 ppm F range. Walsh et al. (2010) reported based on a network meta-
analysis that the relative anticaries effects of fluoride toothpastes increased with higher fluoride concentration. Based on 74 trials involving the caries scores (D MFS) in the mixed 
or permanent dentition, the anticaries effect of fluoride toothpaste was 23% for 
1000/1055/1100/1250 ppm F and 36% 2400/2500/2800 ppm F; however, toothpastes with 440/500/550 ppm F and below did not show a statistically significant effect  compared to 
placebo.   
Due to the high cost involved in conducting clinical caries trials a number of surrogate measures of fluoride efficacy have been introduced. These include in situ  caries models, rat 
caries models, in vitro demineralization and remineralization studies, and fluoride uptake studies. These model systems have been extensively reviewed at a Conference held in Rochester, NY in 1994 (Adv Dent Res 9:169- 340, 1995). While i ntra-oral models have been 
in use for the past forty years, a "Consensus Conference of Intraoral Models" (ADA, Chicago, Sept. 1990) clearly identified the need for validation of intra- oral caries models for 
their potential use as methods of evaluating the efficacy of fluoride dentifrices and other 
fluoride- containing dental products. Based on this conference and the Rochester Models 
conference, there is general agreement among researchers in the field that appropriately validated in situ  models represent an acceptable approach for testing the anticaries potential 
of fluoride products.  
Previous work by our group has shown that a modification of the Koulourides intra- oral 
model (Koulourides et al., 1974) has sufficient sensitivity and reproducibility to respond in dose- response manner to meet the requirements for model validation (Proskin et al., 1992). 
The model, which uses partially demineralized enamel as the starting hard tissue substrate, permits the evaluation of the ability of the test dentifrice to enhance net remineralization.  Our 
current model has been validated based on its  response to different dentifrice fluoride 
concentrations - 0, 250, 500 and 1100 ppm fluoride (Zero et al., 1994; Zero, 1995 ; Zero et 
al., 2005) as well as in several more commercially funded in situ  studies testing fluoride 
    
 5   dentifrice products that also included fluoride dose response controls (unpublished data). 
An additional capability of the model involves testing  the acid resistance of  remineralized 
enamel specimens . This test provides the capability to compare the acid resistance of  the 
mineral  deposited during the in situ  remineralization phase after treatment with different test 
products .  
The purpose of this study is to compare the remineralization potential of an optimized fluoride dentifrice to a control fluoride dentifrice in an in situ  caries model .  
 2. STUDY DESIGN  
This will be a double blind,  single center , 3-way crossover design study.  Two to three days 
before  the start of each treatment period the subjects will have their teeth cleaned to remove  
all accessible plaque and calculus  and will be provided with a non- fluoride dentifrice to use 
until their next visit.  At the beginning of each testing period, two gauze- covered 4 mm round 
partially demineralized bovine  enamel specimens will be placed in the buccal surface of two 
posterior denture teeth (the specimen site may extend into the buccal flange area, if needed)  
of the same side of the partial denture.  Once specimens are placed, subjects will wear their 
partial dentures twenty -four hours a day and use their assigned toothpaste twice daily, as 
instructed, until their next visit . Specimens will be removed after two weeks , and the subjects 
will undergo a t least  a four- to five -day washout period followed by a nother cleaning and two 
to three day lead in period. This process  will be repeated until all subjects have used all 
three  test products.  Changes in the mineral content of the enamel specimens w ill be 
assessed using surface microhardness ( SMH ) and transverse microradiography  (TMR ). 
Enamel fluoride uptake (EFU) will be determined using the mic rodrill enamel biopsy 
technique.  In addition,  the net acid resistance (NAR)  and the comparative acid resistance 
(CAR)  of the reminerali zed enamel specimens  will be determined.

Subjects will also receive a placebo toothpaste and standard toothbrush for home use during 
the 2-  to 3-day lead in period.  
 
4.1 Product Use Instructions  
Subjects will first clean their natural teeth with the partial removed with a toothbrush and 
water only.  They may also brush their partial denture outside of their mouth with a brush and 
water to reach the areas not accessible when the partial denture is in place, while being very careful not to touch the specimen sites . For the test dentifrice they will place their partial 
denture in their mouth and apply a full ribbon of test dentifrice onto the toothbrush. Subjects  
will be instructed to brush the biting surfaces of their back teeth in all four quadrants of their  
mouth for a total of one timed minute taking care to not brush the specimen sites. They will 
then expectorat e the toothpaste slurry and rinse with 15 mL of water for 10 seconds and 
expectorate.   
 4.2 Treatment Compliance  
Product use c ompliance will be assessed by determining the average weight of each type 
of test product prior to dispensing (five tubes per product will be weighed and average weight determi ned).  At the end of each treat ment period, subjects will be required to return all 
product containers (including empty ones) to the study site.  The tubes will be individually 
weighed upon return and that number subtracted f rom the average wei ght will be rec orded 
on the treatment dispensing log.  
 The amount of test product used for each study treatment will be compared to daily product usage recorded on the subject’s diary.  Significant discrepancies will be discussed with the 
study subject, as needed.  Subjects who miss 15% or more treatments within the two- week 
treatment period will be considered non- compliant. The reason for non-  compliance will be 
noted in the subject ’s study records.  
 4.3 Randomization Procedures  
A unique study number will identify all subjects screened for study participation.  Screening 
numbers will be assigned in ascending numerical order according to appearance at the study site. Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study.  
At the first treatment visit, randomization numbers will also be assigned in ascending numerical order according to appearance at the study site.  
    
 9   A randomization schedule will indicate the treatment order sequence.  Each subject will 
complete all three treatment regimens, one treat ment regimen in each of the three  treatment 
periods.  The randomization schedule will be provided by the statistician, IU Department of 
Biostatistics . 
 
4.4 Blinding Procedures and Code Breaks  
The blind will only be broken in an emergency where it is essential to know which treatment a subject received in order to give the appropriate medical care.  
The subject, the study dentist and the laboratory technicians  responsible for performing the 
surface microhardness , TMR  and fluoride analyses will be blinded.  Only specimens and their 
tracking sheets without product identifiers will be sent to lab oratory personnel .  
  
5. STUDY METHODOLOGY  
5.1 Conduct of Study  
This study will be perfor med according to GLP and GCP.  SOP’s for all procedures are on 
file at the Oral Health Research Institute.  
  
5.2 Clinical Procedures  
Visit 1: Screening  – Subjects who have been recruited for the study  via a telephone interview  
will sign in at the study site for t his and all subsequent visits.  At this time, they will complete 
an informed consent statement  and demographic form . Upon review of these documents,  
an update of their medical history/medications  and the inclusion/exclusion criteria, each 
subject will be given an oral soft /hard tissue exam (OS HT) prior to their acceptance into the 
study.  Their mandibular partial denture will be ex amined to determine if specimens can be 
held in two  posterior teeth of the same side, as previously described. They will then provide 
a stimulated and unstimulated saliva sample to determine salivary flow rate.  If no 
contraindications to their participation are discovered and the subject  meet s the study 
requirements, the subject  will be accepted into the study.   
Visit 2: Dental Cleaning Treatment  Period 1 – Two to three days prior to the beginning of 
Treatment Period 1, subjects will return for a professional dental prophylaxis.  The subject’s 
mandibular partial denture will be prepared to hold the enamel specimens.  Specimen  sites 
will be drilled  in the buccal surface of two posterior denture teeth on the same side of the 
partial denture. This area may extend into the buccal flange area, if needed.  A temporary 
filling  (DentuSilTM) will be placed in the drilled out areas of the partial denture.  Subjects will 
be given fluorid e free toothpaste to use at home for the next two to three days until they 
return for their next visit . They will be encouraged to remove their partial denture at night 
until their next visit . Subjects will receive an OST  and OHT  exam at the end of their dental 
cleaning and continuance criteria will be reviewed.  
Visit 3: Begin Treatment Period 1 – Each subject will receive an OST examination, answer 
continuation quest ions, and have their medical history/ medication information updated.  The 
two enamel partially demineralized specimens will be placed in the buccal posterior 
teeth/buccal flange areas on one side of the subject's mandibular partial denture.  All subjects 
will be instructed to wear their partial d enture containing the enamel specimens 24 hours a 
    
 10   day except during the cleaning of their natural teeth (twice per day) and for short periods to 
rinse their mouth out with tap water after meals and snacks.  Each subject will be dispensed  
their assigned treatment product according to the randomization scheme and will be 
instructed on the brushing method and perform their first brushing under supervision at the 
Institute.  
Visit 4 : End Treatment Period 1 – Two weeks following Visit 3, t he subjects will return to the 
Institute and receive an oral soft tissue examination,  answer continuance criteria questions , 
and update their medical history/ medication  information.  The enamel specimens will be  
removed from their partial denture and the hollow s will be filled with a temporary dental filling 
until the next treatment visit.  They will be told to use their regular t oothpaste until they return 
and encouraged to remove their lower partial denture at night . 
Visits 5 -10 – The procedures outlined above will be repeated until each s ubject has used 
each of the three  test product s. At visit 10, s ubjects will receive an oral hard tissue 
examination, have their mandibular partial denture cleaned through sonication, if applicable, have their partial denture repaired either that day or on a future day (if not going on to another 
in situ  study)  and their participation in the study will end.  
 5.3 Lifestyle  Requirements  
1. For 2-3 days following each cleaning visit  subjects must discontinue all regular oral 
hygiene practices (products and procedures) and use only the study fluoride- free 
toothpaste and toothbrush provided,  twice daily,  with the exception of interdental 
cleaners, e.g. dental floss, if this is their normal practice.  
2. For the 14 days of each treatment period subject s may use only the study product 
assigned to them and toothbrush provided twice daily, after breakfast and just before going to bed.  Subjects may floss if this is their normal practice.  
3. Subjects must wear their lower partial denture 24 hours a day, except when cleaning it, during each 14- day treatment period. Subjects will be encouraged to remove their 
mandibular partial denture at night during the washout and lead in periods.  
4. Subjects may use a non- zinc fixative  like Poligrip® on their upper denture but no 
adhesive is permitted in the lower partial denture.  
5. Subjects must refrain from eating canned sardines during the course of the study and may not eat hard candy  when the specimens are in place.  
 5.4 Informed Consent Process  
Written informed consent  will be obtained at the screening visit from each subject after they 
have had the opportunity to read the document, ask questions and had adequate time to 
decide about their participation.  A study representative trained and delegated by the 
Principal Investigator will review the purpose, procedures risk and benefits of the study prior to the subject’s signing of the document.  The study representative will sign and date (and 
give the time) the consent form to confirm the consent process was  completed prior t o 
initiation of any study procedures.  The subject will be given a copy of the signed document.  
 
    
 11   5.5 Oral/Hard  Soft Tissue Examination  
The study dentist will complete an oral soft and hard tissue (OSHT) examination at 
screening, oral har d tissue (OHT) at Visit 1, 2 and 1 0 and an oral soft tissue (OST) 
examination at each study visit. The exams will be conducted via a visual examination of the oral cavity and perioral area utilizing a light  source, dental mirror, gauze, periodontal probe 
and tongue blade as needed. The soft tissue structures examined will involve the labial mucosa including lips, buccal mucosa, mucogingival folds, gingival mucosa, hard and soft palate, tonsillar and pharyngeal areas, tongue, sublingual area/floor of mouth, submandibular area, major salivary glands, head and neck and TMJ. Observations will be listed as “Normal” and “Abnormal” and abnormalities will be described.  
The hard tissue structures examined will include assessing for enamel irregularities, tooth 
fracture, pathologic tooth wear, cavitated lesions, residual  roots, faulty restorations and 
implants.  Observations will be listed as “Absent” or “Present” and conditions noted as 
present will be described  
 
5.6 Salivary Flow Rate Assessment  
Salivary flow rate will be assessed during the screening visit. For the unstimulated collection, 
subjects will sit quietly for five minutes before beginning the test.  During the five- minute test 
time, they will be told to allow their saliva to pool, emptying into a collection cup whenever they feel the need to swallow.  
For the stimulated collections, subjects will chew unflavored gum base for one minute and 
then swallow any pooled saliva.  They will then chew the gum base for two minutes , during 
which time they will e mpty any pooled  saliva  into a collection cup.   
The samples will be weighed , and the salivary flow rates determined.  The unstimulated 
saliva flow rate must  be ≥ 0.2 mL/min and the stimulated saliva flow rate must be ≥ 0.8 
mL/min for study qualification.  
 5.7 Diary for Home U se 
At the start of each treatment period, subjects will be prov ided with a  diary to record the 
date, and the time of the morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) of each brushing and any 
deviation from the brushing regimen.  In addition, subjects will also record any new or 
changes in pre- existing medical conditions, medications or treatments or any change in 
signs or symptoms that may occur.   
Subjects will be required to bring th e completed diary to the end of treatment visit.  Study 
staff will review the Diary Card with the subject to confirm treatment compliance and clarify listed medical conditions, medications , and treatments.  
 5.8 Intra-oral Appliance   
The in situ  model involves the pl acement of gauze- covered enamel specimens in the 
subject’s mandibular partial denture (see Figure 1). The subject’ s denture will be prepared 
for the  study by creating hollow s in two teeth on the same side  large enough to 
accommodate the enamel specimens.  The opening may include the buccal flange area  
below the denture tooth, as needed.  Two gauze -covered enamel specimens  (4 mm round)  
    
 12   will be mounted on the partial denture as described previously.  The specimens placed in the 
buccal surface of the denture teeth will be mounted in place with DentuSil™ - Silicone Soft 
Reline Material (The Harry J.Bosworth® Company, Skokie, IL) or an equivalent material.  
The Dentusil ™ material will be placed in the drilled sites and the enamel specimens carefully 
inserted so that they be mounted flush with the buccal surface of the denture teeth when 
fully seated. Again , great care will be taken to avoid contaminating the enamel surface of 
the specimens with the luting material. Upon completion of the study the subject’s part ial 
denture will be repaired.  The location where the enamel specimens will be placed on the 
subject’s partial denture is not a functional part of the denture, and the experimental procedures will not cause any permanent damage to the denture.   
Prior to placement  in the subjects’  partial  dentures,  all enamel  specimens  will be
 sterilized  by 
exposure to ethylene oxide .

5.9 Adverse Events Assessment  
Subjects will be questioned at each visit regarding any general health or oral complaints and symptoms they have experienced since baseline.  Any findings will be documented on the 
AE CRF.  In the event of subjects reporting AEs outside the scheduled clinical visit, they will 
be assessed at the earliest opportunity by the study dentist and/or Principal Investigator.  
All AEs, regardless of severity or relationship to the test product, will be recorded.  Serious 
AEs include any events resulting in death, decreased life expectancy, life- threatening 
situations, persistent or permanent disability/incapacity, hospitalization, or congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  Within 24 hours, the Investigator will submit a written report 
documenting the circumstances of the serious AE.  The IRB will be notified within five days 
of the incident . 
 

    
 13   6.0 LABORATORY METHODS  
6.1 Specimen Preparation  
Bovine teeth will be used as the hard tissue test substrate  for the preparation of the 4 mm 
round specimens  in the modified in situ  caries model.  Upon receipt  at OHRI , the teeth will 
be sorted, cleaned and stored in 0.1% thymol solution during sample preparation 
procedures.  
Teeth will be selected based on the following criteria:  
• Have no discoloration and no markings, such as cracks, when viewed under a 
microscope at 20× magnification.  
• Sufficient tooth surface to provide a large size specimen to meet study requirements.  
Approximately  two specimens will be obtained from the buccal surface of each bovine  tooth.  
A core of enamel 4 mm in diameter will be prepared from each bovine tooth by cutting 
perpendicularly to the buccal  surface with a hollow -core diamond drill bit.   
The specimens will be ground and polished to create planar parallel dentin and enamel 
surfaces. All grinding/polishing will be done on a polishing surface moistened with deionized water (dw). The dentin side will be ground flat using 500 grit silicon carbi de paper, followed 
by grinding and polishing of the enamel side. A small orientation cut will be placed on each block (see Figure 2 ). The enamel surface of each specimen will be ground using 1200 grit 
silicon carbide paper followed by 2400 and then 4000 gr it silicon carbide paper. After the 
grinding procedures are completed, the enamel specimens will be sonicated in deionized water (dw) for two minutes and then placed under running dw for three minutes. The polishing step will involve the use of a 1 micrometer (μm) diamond suspension on a polishing cloth. The enamel specimens will then be rinsed under a steady stream of dw, sonicated for two minutes in 2% microliquid soap and then rinsed again with dw for three minutes. Resulting specimens will have a thickn ess range of 1. 8 to 2.2 mm. The specimen will have 
a minimum polished surface of 3  mm × 3 mm in the center of the enamel surface.

6.2 Lesion Creation 
The enamel specimens will be partially demineralized using a modification of the method 
described by White [1987]. The 4 mm round bovine specimens will be immersed for 16 hours 
at 37º C under static conditions in 40 ml of an acid buffer (0.05 mol/L lactate), 50% saturated 
with respect to hydroxyapatite and with 0.2% (wt/vol) carbopol 907 (BF Goodrich Co., USA) added (pH adjusted to 5.0 using KOH), and then rinsed thoroughly  with deionized water. 
The demineralized enamel specimens will then be stored in a moi st environment to prevent 
dehydration.  
6.3 Lesion Quality  
Lesions will be inclined towards an overhead light until a reflection is obtained. Acceptable lesions with an intact surface- zone will have a continuous, uniform shiny surface, with no 
matt areas. Lesions with matt area(s) will be rejected. The following c riteria will be used to 
select specimens for inclusion in the study:  
• The lesioned areas of each specimen should be of equal and uniform opacity; and  
• The lesioned areas of each specimen should possess a surface shine when exposed 
to light, thereby indicating an intact surface.  
6.4 Efficacy Measurements and Evaluations 
6.4.1 Surface Microhardness  
The SMH test will be used to assess changes in the mineral status of partially demineralized 
enamel specimens. SMH will be measured using a Wilson 2100 Hardness Tester. Each 
enamel specimen will be secured on a 1- inch square acrylic block with sticky wax and then 
placed on the microhardness tester. Five baseline indentations spaced 100 µm apart will be placed with a Knoop diamond under a 50 gram load in the center of a flattened, polished sound enamel specimen. SMH will be determined by measuring the length of the indentations using Wilson 2100 -  Clemex CMT Software (version 6.0.011).  For enamel 
specimens to be acceptable for use in the study, the mean of the five baseline indentation length must be 43 ± 3 µm with a standard deviation of  ≤ 3µm.  
After in vitro demineralization, the enamel specimens will be again SMH tested by placing five indentations 100 µm to the left of the baseline indentations (see Figure 2). To qualify for the study, the mean (n = 5) indentation lengths of the partially demi neralized specimens 
must be 120 ± 20 µm with a standard deviation of ≤ 10µm. After 14 days of intra- oral 
exposure the enamel specimens will be again SMH -tested by placing five indentations 100 
µm to the right of the baseline indentations (see Figure 2). The extent of remineralization will be calculated based on the method of [Gelhard et al., 1979].  
 %SMH recovery =  (D1-R)/(D 1-B) ×100 
B = indentation length (µm) of sound enamel specimen at baseline  
D1 = indentation length (µm) after in vitro demineralization  
R = indentation length (µm) after intra- oral expos ure. 
    
 15   6.4.2 Enamel Fluoride Uptake  
The microdrill enamel biopsy technique as described by [Sakkab et al., 1984] will be used  
to analyze the fluoride content of the partially demineralized enamel specimens. Each 
enamel specimen will be mounted perpendicular to the long axis of a drill bit attached to a specially designed microdrill and drilled to a depth of ~100 µm through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen; see Figure 2).  
The drilling and sample collection will be performed in a static -controlled atmosphere to 
prevent loss of enamel powder due to charging effects. The enamel powder sample, pooled from the four drilling samples, will be transferred to an analyzer cup cap. 20 microliters (μl) 
of 0.5 Molar (M) Perchloric Acid (HClO
4) will be added to the enamel powder and the cap 
gently swirled to dissolve the powder. To the analyzer cap containing the 20 μl of 
HClO 4/enamel powder, 40 μl of citrate/ ethylene- diamine -tetraacetic  acid (EDTA) buffer and 
40 μl of de- ionized water will be added and immediately analyzed for fluoride content using 
a fluoride specific electrode and pH/Ion meter. The diameter of the drill hole will be 
determined using a calibrated microscope interfaced w ith an image analysis system. The 
amount of fluoride- uptake by enamel will be calculated based on the amount of fluoride 
divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as µg F/cm2.  
6.4.3 Net Acid Resistance test  
To test whether the dentifrice imparts acid resistance to the enamel after 14 days  of intra-
oral exposure, a second in vitro demineralization will be repeated following the same 
protocol as described above on the two  enamel specimens. SMH will be then evaluated by 
placing 5 indentations 100µm to the right of the indentations placed in situ  remineralization 
(See Figure 2) . The %NAR will be calculated by the method of Corpron [Corpron et al., 
1986]:  
 % Net Acid Resistance = [(D1 -D2) / (D1 -B)] * 100   
B= Indentation length (µm) of sound enamel at baseline  
D1= Indentation length (µm) after first in vitro demineralization  
D2= Indentation length (µm) after second in vitro demineralization  
Acid resistance is indicative of any protection that the treatments and intra- oral exposure 
may afford the enamel specimens. The net loss of enamel due to clinical caries is the result of multiple cycles of demineralization and repair (remineralization).  It is well established that 
repaired enamel is more resistant to subsequent acid challenges.  
6.4.4 Comparative Acid Resistance test  
This measure takes a different approach to understanding whether the enamel formed 
during remineralization is more resistant to acid than the original enamel.  Using the data 
from the tw o enamel specimens, the equation used will compare explicitly the reduction in 
SMH brought by the first and second acid challenges:  
    
 16    % Comparative Acid Resistance = [(D2- R) / (D1 -B)] * 100  
B= Indentation length (µm) of sound enamel at baseline  
R= Indentation length (µm) of enamel after in situ  remineralization  
D1= Indentation length (µm) after first in vitro demineralization  
D2= Indentation length (µm) after second in vitro demineralization  
6.4.5 Transverse Microradiography  
Sections, approximately 100 µm in thickness, will be cut parallel to the orientation cut ( as 
shown in Fig ure 2), after completion of the SMH analysis, using a Silverstone- Taylor Hard 
Tissue Microtome (Scientific Fabrications Laboratories, USA). The sections will be placed in 
the TMR -D system and X -rayed at 45 kV and 45 mA at a fixed distance for 12 s. An 
alumini um step wedge will be X -rayed under identical conditions. The digital images will be 
analyzed using the TMR software v.3.0.0.18. Sound enamel will be assumed to be 87% v/v mineral.  
Lesions will be analyzed after in situ  demineralization and the following three parameters 
calculated:  
1. Integrated Mineral Loss - ∆Z= [(lesion depth x 87) - area under the curve*]  
2. Lesion Depth –  L (83% mineral i.e. 95% of the mineral content of sound enamel)  
3. Maximum mineral density at the surface- zone – SZmax  
Note : *area under the curve which relates volume % mineral at distances from the specimen 
surface with respect to section thickness.  
 6.5 Laboratory Data  
After the analyses are completed, all enamel specimen surface microhardness , transverse 
microradiography  and enamel fluoride uptake data will be reviewed by the principal 
investigator before transfer to the statistician.  The investigator will document this review and 
documentation will be filed with the laboratory study files.  
6.6 Specimen Retention  
Laboratory specimens will be retained by the study site for twelve months following database 
lock.  
7. STATISTICAL ANALYSES AND SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
7.1 Statistical Analyses  
The mean % SMH recovery will be calculated using the four  sets of indentations within each 
enamel specimen . The mean fluoride uptake will be calculated using the four samples within 
each enamel specimen . The mean % SMH recovery , mean fluoride uptake,  mean acid 
resistance  and mean ∆Z, L, SZ
max will be computed for the  two enamel specimens within a 
subject by treatment; if  a subject is missing an enamel specimen , the available enamel 
    
 17   specimen will be used.  Analyses of fluoride uptake will be performed after using a natural 
logarithm transformation because the measurements generally are not normally distributed.  
The treatments will be compared using analysis of variance models (ANOVA) suitable for a 
crossover study.  The models will include random effects for subject and fixed effects for 
study period, and product.  The random effects will model the correlation and variances over 
time between treatments . The primary comparison of interest will be to determine if the test 
treatment to be statistically significant compared to the positive control treatment. Secondary 
comparisons will be to determine if the test treatment to be statistically significant compared to the negative control treatment and if the positive control treatment to be statistically significant compared to the negative control treatment.  A 5% significance level will be used 
for all tests. No alpha -level adjustments for multiple comparisons adjustments will be 
applied.   
7.2 Sample Size Justification  
Based on previous studies we estimate the standard deviation of the differences between treatments in the crossover model to be 2 0 for % SMH recovery.  With a sample size of 58  
subjects completing the study, the study will have 80% power to detect a difference between any two treatments of 7.5 for % SMH recovery, assuming two- sided tests each conducted 
at a 5% significance level.  Due to expected dropouts during the crossover study, the study 
will enroll 65 subjects.

Study Design
This study  will be a single -blind, randomised, multi -centre, active controlled trial.  Patients 
aged from 3 months to less than 18 y ears with complic ated urinary  tract infections (cUTIs) 
will be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment groups (3:1 ratio): CAZ -AVI or cefepime.  
Randomisation will be stratified as appropriate.   Patients aged from 3 months to <1 year 
(Cohort 4b) must have been born at term (defined as gestational age ≥37weeks). 
Patients will receive intravenous (IV) treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full day s, ie, 
9doses if given 3 times daily , or 6 doses if given twice dail y) before having the option to 
switch to an oral therap y as specifie d below.  The decision to switch to oral therap y is 
entirely  at the Investigator’s discretion, if the patient has good or sufficient clinical response, 
and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.
Patients will be assessed for safety  and efficacy  throughout the study , and blood samples will 
be taken for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment.  The duration of each patient’s participation 
in the study  will be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 50 day s after start of study  
treatment (defined as the time point at which first dose of study  treatment is administered) at 
which time there will be a Late Follow- up (LFU) assessment visit.  The L FU is to be 
performed 20 to 36 days after the last dose of an y treatment.

Investigational product , dosage and mode of administration
The study  is single blind, ie, a Blinded Observer will not know the patient’s treatment 
assignment and will conduct clinical assessments (including efficacy  and safety ).  There is no 
use of placebo to act as a treatment blind.
Intravenous CAZ -AVI infusions will be given at doses based on the age and weight of the 
patient with adjustment according to renal function:

1Patients considered for entry into the study will be within the normal range of body  mass index ( BMI )for their age, (2 to <18).  A healthy weight BMI for 
this age group falls between the 5th percent ile and ≤95th percentile according to height, weight, and age.
2BMI will not be calculated for children <2 years of age as BMI is not considered a screening tool for healthy weight in child ren under 2 years of age.

Page 10Patients whose CrCL  drops below 30 mL /min should be withdrawn from study  therapy .  
Patients withdrawing from study  therap y can be administered alternative therapies at the 
Investigator’s choice, which should be recorded in the Case Report Form.  If possible, 
patients should still be followed fo r safet y.  Because the CrCl determination is only  an 
estimate of renal function, in instances where the CrCl is approaching thresholds that would 
require intervention such as a dose change or discontinuation of therapy  (ie,CrCL  
approaching 50 or 30 mL/min ), the I nvestigator should use his or her discretion in 
determining (ie,confirming the value by  repeat testing, if feasible) whether an immediate 
dose change, a short period of continued observation, or discontinuation of therap y is 
warranted.  If in the opinion of the Investigator there is a clinicall y significant reduction in a 
patient’s estimated CrCl during the treatment period, then the Investigator should contact the 
Medical Monitor to discuss the above mentioned options (immediate dose change, a sho rt 
period of continued observation, or discontinuation of therap y).  Additionally , in instances of 
rapidly  changing renal function, the I nvestigator should increase the frequency  of CrCl 
monitoring, depending on the patient’s clinical status, extent of ren al function change and 
Investigator’s clinical evaluation.
An optional switch to oral therap y is permitted on or after Day 4 (ie, after 72 hours of IV 
study  drug) .  
The decision to switch to oral therapy  is entirel y at the Investigator’s discretion, 
if the patient has good or sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids 
or food : 
Oral ciprofloxacin ( only in countries where its use for children is permitted; 
according to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per standard of 
care), or
Oral cefixime ( only in countries where its use for children is permitted; according to 
local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care), or
Oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid ( only in countries where its us e for children is 
permitted; according to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per 
standard of care), or
Oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim ( only in countries where its use for children is 
permitted; according to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per 
standard of care), or
Pathogen
-based therapy (in discussion with the Medical Monitor) .  The choice of oral 
antibacterial agent for pathogen- based therap y will be driven b y the results of a 
susceptibility  test, which wi ll be provided tothe Investigator by  either the local or 
central laboratory .  Initiation of pathogen- based therap y is at the Investigator’s 
discretion.  Before administering pathogen -based therap y, the Investigator will 
discuss the results of the suscepti bility  test and the selected antibacterial drug (which 
should be approved for use in children) with the Medical Monitor.

Page 11The patient may  continue on IV study  drug for the entire duration of the study  therapy  (7 to 
14days), at the discretion of the Investi gator.
Comparator
Patients randomised to receive cefepime should receive the dose, schedule and infusion 
duration as recommended in the local prescribing information or as prescribed by  the 
investigator.  The maximum dose of cefepime in any  single infusion should not exceed 
2000 mg.Patients randomised to cefepime treatment may  undergo the optional oral switch as 
described above.
Statistical methods
Block randomisation using an interactive voice/web response s ystem, stratified by  age 
cohort, will be used to assign patients (3:1) to the CAZ- AVI or cefepime study  treatment 
groups.  All study  data will be summarised within each age cohort separately  and also overall 
(regardless of age cohort).
Safety data
The primary  objective will be to assess the safet y and t olerability  of CAZ -AVI compared 
with comparator (cefepime). Safet y data include AEs, clinical laboratory  parameters, vital 
signs, ECG parameters, and phy sical examinations.  For each safet y variable, the last 
assessment made prior to the first dose of stud y drug will be defined as the baseline.  All 
safet y data collected from this study  will be summarised by  the received treatment group (ie, 
for CAZ- AVI versus cefepime, irrespective of switching to oral therap y) for all patients who 
received an y amount of s tudy treatment (termed the ‘Safet y analysis set’) ,and key data will 
also be summarised for those patients who received at least 72 hours of study  treatment
(termed the ‘Safet y evaluable anal ysis set’ ) by received treatment group.  Descriptive 
statistics w ill be produced to summarise the safet y data.  Safet y data from this study  will be 
combined with those from another CAZ -AVI paediatric study  for complicated 
intra-abdominal infections (D4280C00015) and will be presented in the same way .
The incidence of AE s and SAEs will be summarised by  system organ class and preferred 
term according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities vocabulary  by treatment 
group.  The summaries will also be produced b y relationship to study  drug, and by  AE 
intensity.  AE s leading to discontinuation from study  treatment will also be summarised.  
Summary  tables for clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, ECGs, and phy sical examination 
findings will be produced.
Descriptive efficacy data and patient characteristic/Baseline d ata
Efficacy  will be assessed descriptivel y in the intent -to-treat (ITT) set (all randomised 
patients), the microbiological ITT (micro -ITT) set (all randomised patients who have a 
baseline pathogen known to cause c UTI), the clinically  evaluable (CE) analy sis set (patients

Page 12who meet minimal disease criteria for cUTI and all evaluability  criteria, including patients 
who received at least 72 hours of the intended dose and duration of IV study drug, and for 
whom sufficient information regarding the infection is available to determine the patient’s 
outcome ), and the microbiological lyevaluable (ME) anal ysis set (patients who meet minimal 
disease criteria for c UTIand all evaluability  criteria similar to the CE analysis set, and have 
at least 1 ty pical UTI bacteria l pathogen at Baseline that is susceptible to both study  agents, 
ie, CAZ -AVI and cefepime ).
Efficacy  will be assessed, in the ITT, micro -ITT, CE, and ME analysis sets , with respect to 
the proportion of patients with clinical response outcome of cure (at th e end of 72 hours’ 
treatment, at EOIV, EOT, and at the TOC visit) andclinical response outcome of relapse (at 
the L FU visit).  Favourable microbiological response will be assessed in the micro- ITT and 
ME anal ysis sets, and the number of patients with emer gent infections (up to L FU) will be 
assessed in the ME analysis set .  Combined clinical and microbiological response will be 
summarised in the ITT and micro -ITT anal ysis sets at EOIV and TOC visits.  Patients in the 
ITT, micro -ITT, CE ,and ME anal ysis sets will be summarised according to the randomised 
treatment assignment .
Descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and 
maximum) will be provided for continuous variables, and counts and percentages will be 
presented for c ategorical variables.  All summaries will be presented b y treatment group.  
Demographic data and other baseline characteristic data will also be summarised.
Pharmacokinetic data
Pharmacokinetic assessment will be conducted for the PK anal ysis data set.  Th
e data set will 
consist of all patients who will receive CAZ -AVI treatment, and have at least 1 ceftazidime 
and/or avibactam plasma measurement available. 
A listing of ceftazidime and avibactam concentrations at the nominal sampling windows by  
patient and cohort will be provided.  For Cohorts 1 to 4 b, the plasma concentration will be 
summarised by  nominal sampling time window using appropriate descriptive statistics (eg, 
number, mean, SD, minimum, median, maximum, geometric mean, lower and upper SD 
bounds [geometric mean ±SD], and coefficient of variation).
In addition, the avibactam and ceftazidime concentration, paediatric patient demographics, 
and disease status data from Cohorts 1 to 4 bwill be combined with the data from appropriate 
previous clinical s tudies in paediatric patients and/or adults for a population PK analy sis.  
The actual dosing and plasma sampling times will be used for the anal ysis.  The developed 
population PK model may  be used to conduct simulations to determine probability  of PK/PD 
target attainment to help to justify  the CAZ -AVI dose regimens for paediatric patients with 
cUTI.  A stand -alone population PK modelling and simulation analy sis plan will be prepared 
and the results will be reported in a stand -
alone report outside of the cli nical study  report.

1.1.Background And Rationale For Conducting This Study
Avibactam is a novel, non β- lactam, β- lactamase inhibitor.  Although avibactam itself 
possesses no intrinsic antibacterial activity , it has been shown to restore in vitro activity  of 
ceftazidime against Class A, Class C and some Class D β- lactam ase-
producing pathogens 
including those commonly  associated with complicated intra -abdominal infections (cIAIs) 
and complicated urinary  tract infections (cUTIs).  Avibactam, when combined with 
ceftazidime, has also been shown to be active against strains that express a combination of 
β-lactamase t ypes, as well as strains that are concomitantly resistant to other antibacterial 
classes such as fluoroquinolones.
Beta-lactamase inhibition by  avibactam is effected through the formation of a stable covalent 
carbamo yl linkage to the en zyme complex.  It inhibited Class A and Class C β -lactamases b y 
50% at lower concentrations than other currentl y marketed β -lactamase inhibitors such as 
clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam.  In addition, avibactam is a potent inhibitor of 
Class C enzy mes whereas clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam lack any  activity  
against this class of enzymes.  Unlike currently  available β- lactamase inhibitors, avibactam 
does not induce β- lactamase production.
Avibactam inhibited Klebsiella pneumoniae carbap enemase (KPC) -2 β-lactamase in vitro 
and restored ceftazidime susceptibility  to Enterobacteriaceae -harboring KPC -2 or KPC -3 
β-lactamase ( Stach yra et al 2009).4  The potent in vitro activity  of the ceftazidime and 
avibactam (CAZ -AVI) combination against Enterobacteriaceae -producing Class A, and 
Class C, β- lactamases has been confirmed in vivo in murine pneumonia, septicaemia, and 
pyelonephritis models.  
Currently  the options for the trea tment of Gram negative infections, especially  multi- drug 
resistant strains including extended -spectrum β -lactamase producers, are extremel y limited.  
Until recentl y, there have been no new investigational compounds under early or late 
development specifica lly targeted to combat these organisms.  Hence, the availability  and 
development of new agents to treat these infections will be a welcome addition to the 
existing treatments.  
Details of the CAZ -AVI clinical development programme to date can be found in 
Section 5.2.2 of the CAZ -AVI Investigator’s Brochure. 
The purpose of this stud y is to assess the safet y, tolerability  and descriptive efficacy  of 
CAZ -AVI versus cefepime in patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 y ears with cUTI.  
Data from this study will be compared to similar data generated in adult patients so as to be 
able to extrapolate efficacy  and tolerabilit y to children.  The dosing regimen(s) has been 
chosen based on the paediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) study  and PK/pharmacody namic (PD) 
model ling of the exposure required for the successful treatment of infections used in Phase 3 
adult studies.

Page 221.2.Rationale for Study Design, Doses And Control Groups
This study  will be a single blind, randomised, multi- centre, active controlled trial. 
A single bli nd study  observer is a well -accepted study  design in a paediatric population.  
Children are a vulnerable population and need close clinical monitoring by  un-blinded 
observers to interject when needed whilst the blind observer will assess the safet y and the
clinical cure without bias.  Given the risk to patients and severit y of disease, a 
placebo-controlled trial would not be ethicall y appropriate.
The study  is designed to include patients <1 year of age who are born at term only  (defined 
as a gestational ag e ≥37 weeks).  Maturation during foetal life and after birth is a process 
involving all organs and functions of the growing human.  As such, all the main steps of drug 
disposition (absorption, distribution, metabolism, catabolism, elimination/excretion) ma y be 
under the influence of still incomplete morphological stages.  An incompletely  absorbed 
compound may  be less effective whereas a poorl y metabolized and/or excreted compound 
may result in an increased risk of toxicity .  Both risks will have to be evalu ated.  Better 
understanding of the maturing kidney  should help to anticipate possible early  and late 
adverse effects of drugs in neonatal populations.  Nephrogenesis is completed by the end of 
34th week of gestation and the kidney of a full -term neonate (i e, between 37 and 41 weeks of 
gestation) possesses a full set of nephrons and adult levels of glomerular filtration rate are 
reached between 1 and 2 years of age.  Therefore, patients <1 year ofage who were born 
pre-term are excluded from this study .
This study  will be conducted in hospitalised paediatric patients with cUTI requiring treatment 
with intravenous (IV) antibiotics.  The CAZ -AVI doses in this trial have been selected to 
achieve similar exposures reached in the Phase 3 adult studies (D4280C00001 and 
D4280C00005), with the intention of reaching the same level of efficacy  (for further details 
regarding the dose selection rationale, please refer to the CAZ- AVI Investigator’s Brochure).  
The active comparator chosen for this study  is IV cefepime.  C efepime has been widel y used 
for the safe treatment of py elonephritis and cUTI s in children.  Details of the dosing regimen 
can be found in Section 7.2 .
Complicated UTIs are defined as a clinical sy ndrome characterised by  pyuria and a 
documented microbial pathogen on culture of urine or blood accompanied by local and 
systemic signs and s ymptoms, including fever (ie, oral or t ympanic temperature greater than 
38 degrees Celsius), chills, malaise, flank pain, back pain, and/or costo -vertebral angle pain 
or tenderness, that occur in the presence of a functional or anatomical abnormality  of the 
urinary  tract or in the presence of catheterisation. Patients with py elonephritis, regardless of 
underlying abnormalities of the urinary  tract, are considered a subset of patients with cUTIs.

Page 23Complicated UTIs are frequently  managed initially  with IV antibacterial therapy , with 
subsequent conversion to oral antibacterial therapy  after an improvement in clinical 
symptoms.  In clinical practice, the oral agent chosen is dependent upon the results of culture, 
susceptibility  testing and regional common practice.  The oral step -down antimicrobial of 
choice is described in Section 7.

Brochure for CAZ -AVI and the EU Summary  of Product Characteristics for the active 
comparator product.
1.3.Benefit/ Risk And Ethical Assessment
This study  is the first study  with therapeutic intent for CAZ
-AVI in children with cUTIs ;
however, the doses of CAZ -AVI have previously shown to achieve similar exposures in 
adults and children, so efficacy of CAZ -AVI in children is likely .  
Cohort 4 ( ≥3 months to <2 y ears) includes very  young pat ients (aged from 3 months to 
<6months) who are particularl y vulnerable in terms of lack of a ph ysiological reserve and 
rapid maturation of organs.  Therefore, in order to ensure that exposure (maximum 
conce ntration and area under the curve) was minimised in this group, while also still assuring 
robust predictions of sufficient exposure above the PK/PD target, Cohort 4 was divided into 
2parts for further anal ysis for dose selection: Cohort 4a (from 1 year to <2years) and Cohort 
4b (≥3 to <1 year).  This anal ysis indicated that a lower dose of 40 mg/kg 
ceftazidime/10 mg/kg avibactam reduces exposure in Cohort 4b, while still providing very  
high predictions of sufficient exposure above the PK/PD target ( ≥98% probability  of target 
attainment) in patients with normal renal function and patients with mild renal impairment. 
Thus, for the purposes of dosing in this study , Cohort 4 is split into Cohort 4a, who will 
receive the same dose as Cohort 2 (50 mg/kg ceftazid ime/12.5 mg/kg avibactam, every 
8hours), and Cohort 4b, who will receive 50 mg/kg ceftazidime /12.5 mg/kg avibactam, 
every  8hours for patients from 6 months to <1 year of age, and 40 mg/kg 
ceftazidime/10 mg/kg avibactam for patients from 3 months to <6 months of age.
The doses for use in patients with renal impairment have been chosen on the basis of 
modelling and simulation to achieve similar exposures of both ceftazidime and avibactam to 
those in adults with normal or mild renal impairment and prediction s of sufficient exposure 
above the PK/PD target.
Patients enrolled into this clinical study  will have cUTIs that are of sufficient severity  to 
require hospitalisation and treatment with IV antibiotics.  The potential benefit to patients 
participating in th is study  is that they  will receive effective antibiotic therapy  for their 
infection.  The potential benefit of the stud y, in general, is the identification of a novel 
antibiotic combination product that is an effective treatment for cUTIs in the paediatric
population, in the face of the changing pattern of antibiotic resistance.  The safet y and 
tolerability  of CAZ -AVI was established in a Phase 1 s tudy in children from 3 months to 
<18years, during which the exposures were similar to those observed in adult s.

Page 24It is possible that CAZ -AVI may  not be as effective a treatment as the comparator for 
treatment for cUTIs.  This risk is mitigated in that the patients are closel y monitored and will 
be managed with appropriate therapies as determined by  the Investigator who is providing 
treatment.  Furthermore, studies have indicated that there are no drug interactions between 
ceftazidime and avibactam when co -administered, and also that there are no safet y 
implications.
A Phase 3, randomis ed, multice ntr e, double- blind, doub le-dummy, parallel-group, 
comparative study t
odeter mine the effi cacy, safe ty, and t olerability of CAZ- AVI plus 
metroni
dazo le versus m eropenem was conducted in the tr eat ment ofcIAIs in hospital ised 
adult s, aged 18 to 90 y ears. Treatment duration was 5 to 15 day s (RECAIM study ).  The 
doses administered were IV CAZ-AVI (500 mgavibactam and2000 mg ceftazidime), 
immediate lyfollowed by 500 mg I V metronida zole, or 1000 mg IV meropenem , and 
529patients in each treatment arm received study  treatment .   Study treatments were
administered every
8hours. CAZ -AVI was non -inferior compared with meropenem. 
CAZ-AVI plus metronida zolewas effective intreatinginfections duetoGram-nega tive 
pathogens resistant toceftazidime with response rates similar tothatseenwith
cefta zidime -susceptible isolates.  The adverse events (AEs) were generally  mild or moderate in 
severit y and the overa llfrequency and pattern of AEs were co mparable betweenthetreatment
groups. Analy sis of the safet y topics of interest did not re veal an y new safety  concerns.
Another Phase 3 study  was a n open- label, randomised, multicentre , study  of CAZ-AVI and 
Best Available Therap y (BAT) for the treatment of infections due to ceftazidim e-resistant 
Gram-negative pathogens, which was conducted in 3 33 adults aged 18 to 90 y ears diagnosed 
with cIAI or cUTI.  The dose administered was 2000 mg ceftazidime/ 500mg avibactam 
IVover 2 hours. Those patients diagnosed with cIAI received an additional dose of 500 mg 
metronidazole IV. Study t reatments were re peated every  8 hours and the treatment duration 
was 5 to 21 day s. In terms of the primary objective to estimate the pe r-patient clinical 
response to CA Z-AVI and BAT at the Test of Cure (TOC) visit, the estimated clinical cure 
rate at the TOC visit was 90. 9% for CA Z-AVIand 91.2% for BAT. I nthemMITTanalysis
set,theper-patient favourable microbiological response rate forpatients with cUTI at the 
TOC visit was higher in the CAZ- AVI group than in the BAT group (81.9% versus 64.2% , 
respectivel y). 
There w ere no definitive conclusions of an
ytreatment -related trends in patients with cIAI, 
and there were no obvious safe ty concerns identified from the data available. In the patients 
with cUTI, the proportion who experienced an AE up to the Late Follow -up ( LFU) visit was 
28.3% in the CAZ -AVI group and 35.3% in the BAT group.  For patients with cUTI and 
cIAI, the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in int ensity. Up to the LFU visit, the 
incidence of 
serious adverse events ( SAEs )was low and balanced across tr eatment groups
(5.5% in the CA Z-AVI group and 6.0% in the BAT group).  All SAEs were assessed as not 
causal lyrelated to the study treatment bythe Investigato r
. The number of patients with AEs 
of special interest (AEoSI) was general ly low and balanced ac ross treatment groups, with the 
exception of diarrhoea in patients with cUTI, which was higher in the BAT group (5.9% and 
2.0%, for BAT and CA Z-AVI, respective ly).  No new safety concerns were identified from

clinical laboratory tests wasalso low and balanced across treatment groups. There were no 
Hy’s Law cases.
A Phase 2 study  (NXL104/2001) examining the safety  of CAZ -AVI versus imipenem 
cilastatin followed b yappropriate oral therap y as a comparator was conducted in 137 patients 
aged 18 to 90 years with cUTIs.  In this study patients were randomised 1:1 and given 
500mg ceftazidime and 125 mg avibactam IV every  8hours or 500 mg imipenem cilastatin 
IV every  6 hours.  Approximately  35% of patients in the CAZ
-AVI group and 42% of 
patients in the imipenem cilastin group experienced a local reaction at the IV infusion site.  
The majority  of the infusion site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity .  One patien
t in 
the imipenem cilastatin group experienced a severe local reaction (induration, swelling).  The 
most common infusion- related events across the treatment arms were ery thema, pain and 
tenderness.  Of note, patients in the CAZ- AVI group received 3 infusio
ns per day , while 
patients in the imipenem cilastatin group received 4 infusions per day .
In the Phase 2 stud y (NXL104/2002) examining CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole versus 
meropenem as a comparator in patients with cIAIs, approximatel y 30% of participants in 
both the CAZ -AVI and meropenem comparator treatment groups experienced at least 
1symptom of local intolerability , with pain, ery thema, swelling and tenderness reported most 
frequentl y across both groups.  The majority of infusion site events were mild.  T here was a 
somewhat greater percentage of patients with infusion site events of moderate/severe 
intensity  in the CAZ -AVI group, who also received IV metronidazole (17/101 patients 
[16.8%]) versus the meropenem group (11/102 patients [10.8%]).  Of note, pat ients in the 
CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole group received an infusion of 3 different agents per dose, 
whilst patients in the meropenem group received an infusion with 1 study  drug per dose.

-AVI and assess its safe ty and tolerability following a single IV dose was conducted in 
hospitalised paediatric patients aged 3 months to <18 years, receiving systemic antibiotic 
therap yfor suspected or confirmed infection. The patient s in this study  were stratified by age 
and patients were enrolled in each cohort as follows: Cohort 1, pati ents aged ≥12 to 
<18years; Cohort 2, patients aged ≥6 to <12 years; Cohort 3, patients aged ≥2 to <6 years; 
and Cohort 4, patients aged ≥3 months to <2 years (split into 2 groups of at least 4 patients 
each, ≥3months to <1 year and ≥1year to <2 years).  
Patients in Cohort 1 and any patients in Cohort 2 weighing ≥40 kg received a single IV dose
of CAZ- AVI (2000 mg ceftazidime and 500 mg avibactam) administered as a single infusion 
over a 2-hour period onDay 1.  Patients in Cohort 2 weighing <40 kg received a single IV 
dose of C AZ
-AVI(50 mg/kg ceftazidime and 12.5 mg/kg avibactam) administered as a 
single infusion over a 2 -hour period onDay 1.  These doses were applicable for patients with 
normal renal function and mild renal insufficiency (creatinine cl earance [CrCl] >50 to 
80 mL /min).

Page 26In Cohorts 3 and 4, patients with normal renal function or mild renal insufficiency  received a 
single I V dose of CAZ- AVI (50 mg/kg ceftazidime and 12.5 mg/kg avibactam) on Day  1. 
Each patient in the stud y received a sing le IV dose of CAZ-AVI administered as a 
continuous infusion over a 2 -hour period.  There were 32 patients in the safety  analy sis set 
and 32 patients in the PK anal ysis set.
Concentration versus time overlay  plots suggest that the plasma ceftazidime and avi bactam 
concentration profiles were similar in all 4 cohorts across sampling time points.  
Review of the haematology , coagulation, clinical chemistry , and urinal ysis laboratory  values 
did not reveal an y unexpected findings within patients or an y trends acr oss patients; there 
were no potentiall y clinically significant haematology , clinical chemistry , or liver function 
test values reported.  No patients met Potential Hy’s Law criteria.  Review of vital signs 
values and ph ysical examination findings did not id entify  any new safet y concerns.  There 
were no clinically  significant changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs) reported.  The single IV 
dose of CAZ -AVI was well tolerated, with no new safet y concerns identified in hospitalised 
paediatric patients.
The risk considerations for this study  should encompass the known and potential risks for the 
development product CAZ-AVI and its component products ceftazidime and avibactam, as 
well as the risks associated with other treatments that might be administered as describe d in 
this protocol.  Other possible treatments include the marketed product cefepime.  As the risk 
profile for the marketed product is widely  available in the respective prescribing information, 
such risks will not be discussed in this section.  
The risks for CAZ- AVI have not been fully  elucidated; however, it is assumed that known or 
potential risks for CAZ -AVI should include those identified in the clinical study  experience 
with CAZ -AVI, avibactam alone, and for ceftazidime alone.  Additional risk inform ation for 
avibactam and CAZ -AVI is located in the CAZ- AVI Investigator’s Brochure.  
The full risk profile for ceftazidime is described in the prescribing information for the 
product (refer to local ceftazidime product labelling).  I mportant risks as laid out in the 
warnings and precautions in product labelling for ceftazidime include:
Hypersensitivity  reactions.  Though patients with hy persensitivity  and serious allergic 
reactions to cephalosporins carbapenem or other β-lactam antibiotics are excluded 
from the trial, first -time episodes of such reactions could occur ;
Antibiotic -associated diarrhoea, Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, colitis, and 
pseudomembranous colitis;
Bacterial overgrowth with non- susceptible organisms ;
Distal necrosis as a result of inad vertent intra -arterial administration of ceftazidime ;

Page 27Elevated levels of ceftazidime used in patients with renal impairment have been 
associated with neurological sequelae, such as tremors, my oclonus, seizures, 
encephalopath y, and coma .
Potential risks for CAZ -AVI include the occurrence of events seen with ceftazidime alone 
but that go bey ond the frequency and/or severity  of those seen with ceftazidime.  L ocal 
intolerance has been seen in the pre-clinical studies and has been monitored in the clinical 
progr amme.  In the Phase 1 studies, ery thema and haematoma at the administration site were 
reported.  
In regard to h ypersensitivity  reactions, of those reported, there was 1 report in the CAZ -AVI 
clinical trials for which the clinical Investigator considered t he events of skin rash and 
elevated liver function tests to be a possible hy persensitivity  reaction because of the temporal 
relationship of the events to study  therap y administration.  I n the CAZ -AVI development 
programme, rashes have been reported.  Eleva tions of liver enzy mes, independent of skin 
rashes or other potential signs of hy persensitivity , have also been reported.
In summary , the known and potential risks of receiving the developmental antibiotic 
combination CAZ -AVI are expected to be similar to those seen with ceftazidime and 
cephalosporins in general.  Side effects for the avibactam part of CAZ -AVI include injection 
site redness and injection site bruising.  The risks of the marketed antibiotics are considered 
acceptable.  While it is anticipate d that CAZ -AVI will have similar efficacy  for the treatment 
of cUTIs, it is possible that efficacy will not be demonstrated.  For each patient in the trial, 
appropriate treatment of the cUTI is determined b y the clinical Investigator, based on the 
clinical response of the patient.
1.4.Study D esign 
This study  will be a single -blind, randomised, multi -
centre, active controlled trial.  Patients 
aged from 3 months to less than 18 y ears with cUTI swill be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups (3:1 ratio): CAZ -AVI o r cefepime.  Patients aged f rom 3 months to <1 year 
(Cohort 4b) must have been born at term (defined as gestational age ≥37weeks).
A sufficient number of patients are to be randomised 3:1 for 80 patients to complete at least 
72hours (3 full day s, ie, 9 doses if given 3 times daily , or 6 doses if given twice dail y) of 
study  treatment (ie, evaluable patients; at least 60 patients in the CAZ- AVI group and at least 
20 patients in the cefepime group).
Patients will be allocated to 1 of 4 cohorts based on age.  Each cohort is required to have a 
minimum number of evaluab le patients, and randomisation will be stratified as follows: 
Cohort 1: At least 6:2 evaluable patients aged from 12 y ears to <18 years;
Cohort 2: At least 6:2 evaluable patients aged from 6 y ears to <12 years;
Cohort 3: At least 9:3 evaluable patients ag ed from 2 y ears to <6 years;

Page 28Cohort 4: At least 18:6 evaluable patients aged from 3 months to <2 y ears comprising 
Cohorts 4a and 4b as follows: 
Cohort 4a: At least 9:3 evaluable patients aged from 1 y ear to <2 years;
Cohort 4b: At least 6:2 evaluable pati ents aged from 3 months to <1 y ear, with 
a minimum of 3 patients with at least 1 PK sample aged from 3 months to 
<6months treated with CAZ -AVI.
Intravenous CAZ -AVI infusions will be given at doses based on age and weight with 
adjustment according to renal function as detailed in Table 5.
Patients whose CrCl drops below 30 mL /min should be withdrawn from study  therapy .  
Patients withdrawing from study  therap y can be administered alternative therapies at the 
Investigator’s choice, w hich should be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  I f possible, 
patients should still be followed for safety (see 
Section 3.9.1).  Because the CrCl 
determination is only  an estimate of re nal function, in instances where the CrCl is 
approaching thresholds that would require intervention such as a dose change or 
discontinuation of therapy  (ie CrCL approaching 50 or 30 mL /min) , the Investigator should 
use his or her discretion in determining (ie confirming the value by  repeat testing, if feasible) 
whether an immediate dose change, a short period of continued observation, or 
discontinuation of therapy  is warranted. If in the opinion of the I nvestigator there is a 
clinically  significant reducti on in a patient’s estimated CrCl during the treatment period, then 
the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the above mentioned options 
(immediate dose change, a short period of continued observation, or discontinuation of 
therap y).  Additionall y, in instances of rapidly changing renal function, the Investigator 
should increase the frequency  of CrCl monitoring, depending on the patient’s clinical status, 
extent of renal function change and Investigator’s clinical evaluation.
Patients r andomised to receive cefepime should receive the dose, schedule and infusion 
duration as recommended in the local prescribing information or as prescribed by  the 
investigator.  The maximum dose of cefepime in any  single infusion should not exceed 
2000 mg.
Patients will receive IV treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full day s, ie, 9 doses if given 
3 times daily , or 6 doses if given twice dail y) before having the option to switch to an oral 
therap y as specified in 
Section 7.7below.  The decision to switch to oral therapy  is entirel y at 
the Investigator’s discretion, if the patient has good or sufficient clinical response, and the 
patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.  Patients can contin ue to take IV CAZ -AVI up to 
Day 14.  Patients requiring sy stemic proph ylactic antibiotic medication for any  reason at 
Screening are allowed to enter the stud y provided that they discontinue this medication prior 
to first dose of randomised study treatment ( see Section 7.8for further details).

DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWAL 
This study  can fulfill its objectives only  if appropriate subjects are enrolled.  The following 
eligibility  criteria are designed to select subjects for whom participation in the study  is 
considered appropriate.  All relevant medical and nonmedical conditions should be taken into 
consideration when deciding whether a particular subject is suitable for this protocol .
Subject eligibility  should be reviewed and documented by  an appropriate member of the 
investigator’s study team before subjects are included in the study .  Each patient should meet 
all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for this study .  Under no 
circumstan ces can there be exceptions to this rule.
3.1.Inclusion Criteria
For inclusion in the study  patients should fulfil the following criteria:
1. Must be ≥3 calendar months to <18 years of age.  Patients aged ≥3 calendar months to 
<1year must have been born at term (defined as gestational age ≥37weeks).
2.Written informed consent from parent(s) or other legally
 acceptable representative(s), and 
informed assent from patient (if age appropriate according to local regulations)
3.If female and has reached menarche, or has r eached Tanner stage 3 development (even if

(a) Patient reports sexual abstinence for the prior 3 months or reports use of at least 
1of the acceptable methods of contraception, including an intrauterine device (with 
copper banded coil), levonorgestrel intrauterine s ystem (eg, Mirena®), or regular 
medroxy proge sterone injections (Depo -Provera®); or (b) Patient agrees to initiate 
sexual abstinence from the time of screening until 7 days after end of treatment with 
study  drug; and
Patient is advised to avoid conception from the time of screening until 7 day s after
receipt of stud y drug and agrees not to attempt pregnancy  from the time of screening 
until 7 day s after end of treatment with study  drug; and
Patient is provided guidelines regarding continuation of abstinence, initiation of 
abstinence, or about allowed contraception; and
Patient has a negative serum β -human chorionic gonadotropin (β -hCG) test just prior 
to study  entry .  Since serum tests may  miss an early  pregnancy , relevant menstrual 
history  and sexual history , including methods of contraception, should be considered.  
Note: if the result of the serum β -hCG test cannot be obtained prior to dosing of 
investigational product, a patient may  be enrolled on the basis of a negative urine 
pregnancy test, though a serum β -hCG test result must still be obtained.
Note 1: Hormonal contraceptives delivered orally, as patches, or via vaginal devices should 
not be used as a method of birth control because the effect of CAZ -AVI on the efficacy of 
these types of contraceptives has not yet been established.  
Note 2: Barrier methods (such as male condom) can be used as a means of preventing 
sexually transmitted disease but are not acceptable as a means of contraception for this 
clinical trial.  
4.Patient has a clinically suspected and/or bacteriologically documented cUTI or acute 
pyelonephritis judged by  the I nvestigator to be serious and requires the patient to be 
hospitalised for treatment with I V therap y.

Note: If patients meet all of entry criteria except for positive urine culture as outlined above, 
the patients may be enrolled before urine culture results are available if the results are likely 
(based on urinalysis and clinical findings) to be positi ve and study drugs are considered 
appropriate empiric therapy.  If a patient urine culture is negative after 24 or 48 hours of 
treatment but the patient is improving, the Investigator can keep the patient on treatment.  If 
the urine culture is negative and the patient is not improving, study treatment will be 
stopped, and the patient will be followed for the rest of the study including undergoing all 
safety assessments until LFU.

3.3. Subject Enrolment And Randomisation
Investigator(s) should keep a record, the patient screening log, of patients who entered 
pre-study screening.  Patients will be enrolled if they meet all the inclusion criteria, including informed consent and assent in writing from parent(s) or other legally-acceptable representative(s)/patient as applicable, and none of the exclusion criteria.  The Blinded Observer may perform screening and enrolment; however, the Investigator must perform randomisation.
The Blinded Observer/Investigator will:1. Obtain signed informed consent from the parent or guardian/legally acceptable 
representative(s) of the potential patient and informed assent from the potential patient (if 
age appropriate according to local regulations) before any study specific procedures are performed
2. Assign potential patient a unique enrolment number, beginning with 
3. Determine patient eligibility (see Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 .
4. Investigator only: Assign eligible patient unique randomisation code (via an interactive 
voice/web response system [IXRS] not available for access by the Blinded Observer)
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused.
Randomisation codes will be assigned strictly sequentially as potential patients become 
eligible for randomisation.
3.4. Procedures For Handling Incorrectly Enrolled Or Randomised Patients
Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, be 
enrolled or receive study medication.  There can be no exceptions to this rule.  Patients who are enrolled, but subsequently found not to meet all the eligibility criteria, must not be randomised or initiated on treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study.
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomised in error, or 
incorrectly started on treatment, the Investigator should inform the Medical Monitorimmediately, and a discussion should occur between the Medical Monitor and the 
Investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the patient from treatment. The 
Medical Monitor must ensure all decisions are appropriately documented.PPD

Block randomisation using an IXRS will be used to assign patients in a ratio of 3:1 to the 
study  treatment groups of CAZ -AVI or cefepime respectivel y in each of the cohorts for the 
age groups (see Section 8.2 for a description of the sample size).
A representative of Sponsor , under the supervision of Sponsor statistical personnel, will 
perform this randomisation. 
3.6. Methods for Ensuring Blinding
This study  will be observer-
blinded.  Each investigational site will be required to have a 
site-specific Blinding Plan that describes site- specific precautions being taken to ensure that 
the study  is observer -blinded, taking into account the specific patient care procedures , 
equipment, and information accessibility  at that site.
At each investigational site, at least 1 blinded investigator (referred to as “Blinded Observer”
hereafter) will not know the patient’s treatment assignment and will conduct clinical 
assessments rela ted to safety  and efficacy .  The Blinded Observer may  perform screening and 
enrolment activities but will not be responsible for randomising patients (the Blinded 
Observer will not have access to the IXRS).  The Blinded Observer will not ask other 
members of the stud y team, the patient, or the patient’s parent(s)/legall y acceptable 
representative(s) which study  treatment is being given, and will avoid all attempts to uncover 
treatment assignment.  The Blinded Observer should arrange to see the patient durin g times 
when study  drug is NOT being administered, and not when assessments are being performed 
that could possibly  unblind the Blinded Observer, in order to maintain the blind.  I f possible, 
the same Blinded Observer should complete all clinical assessmen ts for a patient. The 
Blinded Observer should perform all causalit y assessments for all AEs and SAEs.
At each investigational site, an unblinded Investigator (referred to as “Investigator” 
hereafter), Pharmacist or designee, study  centre personnel, patien t, and parent(s)/legally  
acceptable representative(s) may  be aware of which IV study  drug therap y is being 
administered and shall be instructed not to reveal to the Blinded Observer which drug the 
patient is receiving. Refer to Section 3.7 if the Blinded Observer learns of the treatment 
assignment.
3.7.Methods For Unblinding 
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomisation for each randomised 
patient, will be available to the I nvestigator(s) or pharmacists from the IXRS.  Routines for 
this will be described in the IXRS user manual that will be provided to each centre.
This study  has an observer -blinded design.  During the study , the Blinded Observer(s) will 
not make an y effort to determine which IV stud y drug is being administered.  The details of 
blinding will be described in the Blinding Plan.

Only  in the case of an emergency , when knowledge of the study  drug is essential for the 
immediate clinical management or welfare of a spe cific patient andthe Investigator or 
designee is not available to provide or cannot provide appropriate medical care to the patient, 
may the Blinded Observer be unblinded to the patient’s treatment assignment.
Before an y unblinding of the Blinded Observer , it is strongly  advised to discuss options with 
the Medical Monitor or appropriate stud y personnel. As soon as possible, and without 
revealing the patient’s study  treatment assignment (unless important to the safet y of patients 
remaining in the study ), the Blinded Observer or designee must notify  PRA Health Sciences 
(PRA) if the observer blind is broken for an y reason and the Blinded Observer was unable to 
contact PRA before unblinding. PRA Health Sciences is a contract research organization that 
manages various aspects of this study  on behalf of the Sponsor.  PRA will inform Sponsor of 
the incident .
3.8. Restrictions
Hormonal contraceptives which are potentially  subject to drug -to-drug interaction, such as 
pills, patches, and intravaginal devices, are not ac ceptable methods of birth control during 
this study  based on potential for antibiotics to alter gut flora, hormone absorption, and 
hormone effectiveness.  If an adolescent female study  participant was previously  using 
hormonal contraceptives such as pills, patches, and intravaginal devices, she should follow 
her health care provider’s specific recommendations for effective use of these methods after 
completing I V study  therapy .  Such recommendations may  address the need for a second 
method of contraception until the hormonal method becomes full y effective.
3.9.Discontinuation Of Investigational Product
Patients may  be discontinued from IP in the following situations:
Patient or patient’s parent(s)/legally  acceptable representative(s) decision.  The 
patient or th e patient’s parent(s) or other legally acceptable representative(s) is at an y 
time free to decide to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment
AE (eg, risk to patients, as judged by  the Investigator)
Positive pregnancy  test at any  time during the study  treatment period
In the absence of any alternative explanation for an increase in the following 
abnormalities, individual patients should be withdrawn if the following hepatic/liver 
criteria are met:
ALT or AST >8×ULN ;
ALT or AST ≥3×ULN and either total bilirubin ≥2×ULN or evidence of 
coagulopath y.  Evidence of coagulopath y should be discussed with the PRA 
physician where possible ;

or progressive liver disease.  Sy mptoms suggestive of new or progressive liver 
disease should be discussed with the PRA phy sician where possible.
Significant reduction in CrCl measurements as judged by  the investigator ;
CrCl value <30 mL /min;
Severe non -compliance with the stu dy protocol as judged by  the Investigator ;
In the opinion of the Investigator, it is not in the best interest of the patient to continue 
study  therapy  and/or lack of efficacy .
3.9.1. Procedures For Discontinuation Of A Patient From Investigational Product 
At any time, patients or the patient’s parent(s) or other legall y acceptable representative(s) 
are free to decide to discontinue the child’s use of I P or withdraw from the study  (ie, IP and 
assessments – see Section 3.10), without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient or the 
patient’s parent(s) or other legall y acceptable representative(s) who decides to discontinue I P 
will alway s be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any  AEs.  If possible, they  will 
be seen and assessed b y an Investigator(s) at the time of discontinuation from the I P and at 
the L FU visit.  
Adverse events and SAEs will be followed up (See Section 6).  For patients who discontinue 
IP earl y, their follow -up assessments should be collected ( see Section 3.10.3 for follow -up of 
unresolved AEs).  Liver CRF modules should be completed for patients discontinued after 
meeting hepatic/liver criteria.  The patient should be scheduled for the EOIV visit within 
24hours after IV stud y therap y discontinuation, ideally  before starting any new antibiotic 
treatment.
If a patient is withdrawn from study , see Section 3.10 .
3.10. Criteria for Withdrawal 
Subjects may
 withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the dis cretion of the investigator or S ponsor for safety  (see also the 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the 
inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site. 
3.10.1. Screen Failures 
Screen failures are patients who have provided informed consent/assent and subsequently do 
not fulfil the eligibility  criteria for the study , and therefore must not be randomised.  These 
patients should have the reason for stud y withdrawal recorded as ‘Fail ed Eligibility  Criteria’ 
(ie, patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria).  This reason for stud y 
withdrawal is only  valid for screen failures (not randomised patients).  For details on the

Section 3.1. 
3.10.2. Withdrawal of the Informed Consent
Patients or the patient’s parent(s) or other legally  acceptable representative(s) are free to 
withdraw the child from the study  at any  time (IP and assessments), without prejudice to 
further treatment.
A patient or the patient’s parent(s) or other legally  acceptable representative(s) who 
withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) an d the presence of an y AEs.  
The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study .Ifthe 
parent/legall y-acceptable representative withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no addit ional data should be 
collected.  The S ponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study , then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. 
3.10.3. Lost to F ollow -up
If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
patient.  
All attempts to contact the patient and information received during contact attempts 
must be documented in the patient ’s source documentation.  In any circumstance, every  
effort should be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  The investigator should 
inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the patient return for a final visit, if 
applicable, and follow up with the patient regarding any  unresolved adverse events (AEs).
3.11. Discontinuation of the Study
The study  may  be stopped if, in the judgment of Sponsor , trial patients are placed at undue 
risk because of clinicall y significant findings that:
Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered significant 
Are assessed as causall y related to stud y drug 
Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patients at the time of 
discont inuation of follow- up must be recorded in the CRF.  All reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented.
In terminating the study , the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients’ interests.

of study  drug or ea rly withdrawal from study (if on IV study drug).  The EOIV assessments 
should be conducted in place of the regular study  visit (eg, Day s 4 to ≤14) assessments that 
would have been performed the day  of that visit.  A patient may  be eligible to switch to ora l 
therap y on or after Day 4 ( Section 7.2); EOIV assessments must occur 
before starting oral 
switch therap y.  The following will be performed: 
Complete phy sical examination ;
Recording of conco mitant medications, including mother if patient is breast fed;
Vital signs;
Recording of an y adjunctive therapeutic procedures performed ;

5.STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -
required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject.  When a protocol -required test cannot be perform ed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior 
to initiation of the study .

Page 535.1.Efficacy Assessments
Clinical outcome, r elapse, and emergent infections will be assessed b y the Blinded Observer 
at the time points specified in Table 1.  The Blinded Observer will assess clinical outcome, 
(including at L FU, assessment of patients for clinical relapse) and collection and reporting of 
AEs and SAEs from signing of the ICF (and Assent Form if applicable) until at least 30 days 
after an y dose of stud y drug (IV or oral) or LFU. 
5.2. Microbiological 
Assessments
Culture and organism identification should be perform ed at the local or regional laboratory , 
as applicable.  Susceptibility  testing should be done at the local or regional laboratory  to 
support patient care.  All isolates should be sent to the central laboratory  for organism 
identification and susceptibility testing.
Refer to the stud y-specific clinical and microbiology  laboratory  manual for specific 
procedures pertaining to the collection, processing, storage, and shipment of blood and urine 
culture samples or isolates.
5.2.1. Urine Samples For Microbiological Anal ysis And Culture
Urine samples should be obtained for culture and routine quantitative analysis (including 
microscopic examination) at Baseline (before an y antibiotics are administered) and at EOIV, 
EOT, TOC, and LFU.  Cultures should be repeated per stand ard of care upon knowledge of a 
positive result until sterilisation is confirmed.  
5.2.2. Blood Samples For Microbiological Analysis And Culture
If clinicall y indicated, blood samples (1 mL) may be obtained for culture and routine anal ysis 
(including microscopic examination) at Baseline (before an y antibiotics are administered) 
and at an y time until L FU.  
This protocol complies with European Union’s recommendations for blood loss associated 
with paediatric research ( European Commission 2008 )1and the World Health Organisation 
guidelines “Blood Sample Volumes in Child Health Research: Review of Safe Limits” 
(Howie 2011 ).2  To minimise risk from blood loss associated with this study , standard of care 
laboratory  results will be used whenever possible.  I n addition, paediatric blood collection 
tubes will be used and capillary  methods of blood draw will be implemented whenever 
feasible.  PK samples will be collected from patients unless deemed unsafe due to the risk 
from additional blood loss (per the Investigator’s judgment).
5.3.Safety A ssessments
5.3.1. Laboratory Safety Assessments
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry , haematology , and urinal ysis 
will be taken at the times indicated in Table 1

considered necessary, but will not be part of the required laboratory parameters as per protocol.  Assessment of 
any additional laboratory parameters should not impact the blood volume to be drawn.
a. If a patient’s haemoglobin or haematocrit decreases significantly (in the Investigator’s judgment) after 
administration of the CAZ-AVI infusion, a workup for haemolytic anaemia should be performed per standard of 
care.   
b. To be collected if clinically indicated or if required per standard of care.
Additio nal safet y samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  The date, time of collection and results (values, units and reference ranges) will 
be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
The clinical chemistry , haematology  and urinal ysis will be performed at a local laboratory  at 
or near to the Investigator site.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may  vary  depending on 
laboratory  method used and routine practice at the site.

Page 55The Direct Coombs test is required at Baseline and TOC only. 
The Investigator should make an assessment of the available results with regard to clinicall y 
relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at 
centre as source data for laboratory variables.  For information on how AEs based on 
laboratory  tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 6.1.1.
NB. If a patient shows an AST orALT ≥3×ULN or total bilirubin ≥2×UL N please refer to 
Appendix D for further instructions.
Creatinine clearance will be measured at Baseline and at each time that serum creatinine is 
being assessed as part of the clinical chemistry  panel using the child’s measured height 
(length) and serum creatinine within the updated “bedside” Schwartz formula ( Schwartz et al 
2009
).3It is recommended that serum creatinine, and therefo re CrCl obtained using the 
Schwartz bedside formula, are assessed at additional time points if the I nvestigator deems 
that the test is required for the safet y of the patient, based on previous results and the 
patient’s clinical condition, and if the additi onal test(s) does not exceed the maximum 
volume of blood allowed per protocol.  The Investigator should also consider the balance of 
the risk and benefit of taking additional samples when making the decision.  If a 
biochemistry  panel is requested and serum creatinine can be added and evaluated without 
increasing the volume of blood allowed per protocol, the site should record the result in the 
CRF.  Note: measurement of height is not required at each point that CrCl is estimated : 
CrCl (mL/min/1.73m2)=0.413 ×height (length) (cm)/serum creatinine (mg/dL)
Ifthere is a significant reduction (according to the Investigator) in a patient’s estimated CrCl 
during the treatment period, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor for 
discussion
.
5.3.2. Physical Exami nation
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed and will include an assessment of the 
following: general appearance, skin, head and neck  (including ears, ey es, nose and throat), 
lymph nodes, thy roid, respiratory , cardiovascular, abdomen, musculos keletal (including 
spine and extremities) and neurological s ystems . Height and weight will be measured at 
Baseline only .  Weight may  be measured at subsequent time points if clinically  indicated and 
feasible.  Body  mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) will be calcula ted as the ratio of weight in 
kg/(height in cm/100)2.  BMI  will only  be calculated at Baseline (Day  -1/Day 1).  BMI will 
not be calculated for children <2 years of age (Cohorts 4 a and 4b ) as BMI  is not considered a 
screening tool for healthy  weight in children <2 years of age.  Tanner staging of development 
(refer to Appendix E for further details on Tanner staging) will be assessed at screening only  
(Day  1/Day 1) for females who have not reached menarche but may  reasonably  have the 
potential to become pregn ant.

Page 565.3.3. Electrocardiogram
A single 12-lead (or as appropriate per Investigator decision) ECG recording will be 
performed at the times indicated in Table 1.  At Baseline, the ECG will be performed prior to 
obtaining blood samples fo r laboratory  testing.  The Day  1 ECG will be performed within 
30minutes following the end of the first study  treatment infusion.  Electrocardiograms will 
be taken after the patient has been resting in a recumbent position for at least 10 minutes.  
The res ults for the ECG will be paper reports provided locally  for safet y review b y the 
Investigator.  
Each ECG will be interpreted as appropriate for the patient’s age.
5.3.4. Vital 
Signs
Vital signs will be measured as required as well as at the time intervals indica ted in Table 1
before the ECG on the days when both assessments are indicated.  On day s when more than 
1 vital signs assessment is performed as part of the standard of care for the patient, the first 
set of vital sign measurements for the day and the highest temperature of the day  should be 
recorded in the CRF. 
5.3.4.1. Pulse and blood pressure
Supine blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured.  The patients will be required to rest 
in the supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to heart rate and blood pressure 
measurements.  For timings of vital signs assessments refer to Table 1
.
5.3.4.2. Body Temperature
Body  temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius using an automated thermometer at 
the times indicated in Table 1and the actual time of body  temperature collection will be 
recorded.  For each individual patient, the method of temperature measurement (oral, rectal, 
temporal, axillary , or t ympanic, as appropriate) ideally should be c onsistent for the duration 
of the study .  
5.3.4.3. Respiratory 
Rate
Respiratory  rate will be measured in breaths per minute at the times indicated in Table 1.
5.3.4.4. Adverse Events
Adverse events will be collected at Baseline, throughout the Tre atme nt Period, and at EOT, 
TOC and L FU.  AEs and SAEs are defined in Sections Section 6.1.4 and Section 6.1.4.1 and, 
respectivel y.  AEs will be collected and reported as described in Section 6.1.4.2.

In addition to AE and SAE monitoring as described in Section 6, cephalosporin class effects 
and additional AEs will also be closely  monitored (including, but not limited to seizures, 
C.difficile -associated diarrhoea, allergic reactions, hepatic abnormalities, haemoly tic 
anaemia and c hanges in renal function).
5.4.Other A ssessments
Medical and surgical history  and prior and concomitant medications will be recorded at 
Baseline and, if applicable, during the study  according to Table 1
.  See Section 7.8for further 
details on concomitant medications. Serum β -hCG pregnancy  tests will be performed at 
Baseline and TOC in female patients who have reached menarche or have reached Tanner 
stage 3 development.  If the result of the serum β -hCG test cannot be obt ained prior to dosing 
of investigational product, a urine pregnancy  test may  be done at Baseline though a serum 
β-hCG test result must still be obtained.
If performed, adjunctive therapeutic procedures will be recorded throughout the treatment 
period until
TOC. 
Radiological examinations are not required for the study, but the results should be recorded if 
done as part of the diagnosis.  Radiological examinations include WBC scans, plain 
abdominal radiographs, CT scans, voiding cy stourethrogram, ultrasound and/or MRI  scans 
with or without contrast.    
5.5.Pharmacokinetics
5.5.1. Collection of Samples
Blood samples (1 mL per sample for Cohorts 1 and 2, and 0.5 mL per sample for Cohorts 3, 
4a,and 4 b) for determination of ceftazidime and avibactam in plasma will be take n at the 
times presented in Table 1in a manner such that the Blinded Observer remains blinded (ie, 
the Investigator should collect the samples).  The date and time of sample collection will be 
recorded, as well as the date and ti me of the dose of IV study  therap y immediatel y preceding 
the sample collection.
Samples will be collected, labelled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual. 
5.5.2. Determination Of Drug Concentration
Samples for determination of ceftazidime and avibactam concentration in plasma will be 
analysed by Covance on behalf of Sponsor , using an appropriate bioanal ytical method.  Full 
details of the anal ytical method used will be described in a separate bioanaly tical report.

6.ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND MEDICA L MANAGEMENT
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study  are 
familiar with the content of this section.
6.1.Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety  events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to Pfizer Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of events: (1) SAEs; (2) 
non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under 
study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational ex posure.

Study Code AZ / Pfizer C3591005
Edition Number 3
Date 17 July 2017
Page 60Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfizer Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within 24 hours o f awareness of the event by the investigator are to be reported 
regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an 
investigational product under study .  In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, 
notification to Pfizer Safety  must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator doe s not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may be 
requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF.  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and inde pendent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to Pfizer Safety .  An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing s afety reviews conducted b y the S ponsor, an y non -seriou s AE that is 
determined b y the S ponsor to be s erious will be reported by  the S ponsor as an SAE.  To 
assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
6.1.1.
Additional Details On Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that t he CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
6.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the parent(s)/l egal guardian/legally  acceptable representative.  In addition, each 
parent(s)/legal guardian/legally  acceptable representative will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.

Page 616.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events 
Withdraw al due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF.  
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported , as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
6.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject b egins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including the 
LFU visit.
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
6.1.4.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer 
Safety  on the CT SA E Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  ofbeing related to investigational 
product must be reported to Pfizer Safety .
Follow up by  the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and 
until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the inv estigator, and 
Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
6.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  the investigator may  be required until the event or i ts sequelae resolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
6.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator mu st record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable

possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, th en 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporti ng purposes, as 
defined b y the S ponsor.  If the investigator's causality  assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented o n study  records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
6.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applica ble local regulations.
6.2.Definitions
6.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;

Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
6.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnorma l objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to b e an AE b y the inves tigator or S ponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
6.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serio us adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
a.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization .
note: patients will be hospitalised at st udy entry .  The initial hospitalisation that 
made the patient eligible for the stud y will not be considered an SAE but if the 
hospitalisation is prolonged due to an AE, the hospitalisation becomes an SAE) .
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);

Edition Number 3
Date 17 July 2017
Page 64Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an e vent is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to preven t one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hosp italization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
6.2.4. Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admi ssion also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency room visit does not nece ssaril y constitute a hospitalization; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Note: patients will be hospitalised at study  entry .  The initial hospitalisation that made the 
patient eligible for the study will not be considered an SAE but if the hospitalisation is 
prolonged due to an AE, the hospitalisation becomes an SAE)
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include:
090177e18ddb7be5\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:06-Mar-2018 10:39 (GMT)
Drug Substance 
Study Code AZ / Pfizer C3591005
Edition Number 3
Date 17 July 2017
Admissio n for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  the study  
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject;
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
6.3.Severity Assessment
The investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to descri be the 
maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are 
defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes s ignificantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual functi on) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.

Page 666.3.1. Actions Required In Cases Of Increases In Liver Chemistry Values
The Investigator is responsible for, without delay , determining whether the patient meets 
potential Hy ’s law criteria; AST or ALT ≥3×ULN andtotal bilirubin ≥2×ULN irrespective 
of the value of the patient’s alkaline phosphatase, at an y point during the study following the 
start of study  medication.  
A Hy ’s Law case is defined as study  patient with an increase in serum AST or ALT ≥3×ULN 
together with total bilirubin ≥2×ULN, where no other reason can be found to explain the 
combination of increases, eg, elevated serum ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, or 
another drug.
For potential Hy ’s Law and Hy ’s Law the elevation in transaminases must precede or be 
coincident with (ie, on the same day ) the elevation in total bilirubin, but there is no specified 
timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and total bilirubin must occur.  
Details regarding the actions required in the cases of increases in ALT, AST, and total 
bilirubin can be found in Appendix D.  
If a patient reaches an ALT or AST=5×ULN, the patient may  continue with the I P as planned 
unless discontinuation criteria as desc ribed in Section 3.9are met.  The patient should be 
seen within 48 hours to instigate enhanced follow -up and monitoring.  Enhanced follow -up 
should include collection of clinical and historic al information to determine the cause of ALT 
and/or AST elevations.  Additional testing for liver laboratory  test results must be done every  
48 hours until the peak value has been reached as documented by  a decline in the values 
and/or until the patient is feeling better.  The frequency  of retesting can decrease to once per 
week or less if abnormalities stabilise or study  drug has been discontinued and the patient is 
asymptomatic.  The patient should be followed until resolution (including laboratory  testin g).
6.4.Special Situations
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer 
Safety  by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database. 
6.4.1. Medication Errors, and Lac k of Eff icacy
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors and lack of efficacy .

Page 676.4.1.1. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength, or at the 
wrong infusion rate.  
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the S ponsor should be notified immediately .
Whe nthe medication error is accompanied b y an AE, as determined b y the investigator, the
associated AE(s) , serious and non- serious, are recorded on an AE page of the CRF.
Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE .
6.4.1.2. Lack of Efficacy
Lack of efficacy  is reportable to Pfizer Sa fety only if associated with an SAE.
6.5.Overdose
Overdose is defined as a dose administered to a patient in excess of that specified in this 
protocol. Overdose does not automatically  make an AE serious but if the consequences of 
the overdose are serious for example death or hospitalisation, the event is serious and should 
be reported as such.
Recording an overdose will be done according to the following:
An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.
An overdose without associated s ymptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF 
module.
If an overdose on an Pfizer IV stud y therap y occurs in the course of the study, then 
Investigators or other study  centre personnel wil l inform appropriate Pfizer
representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately  but no later than the end of the next 
business day  from when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated Pfizer representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all 
releva nt information is provided to the Pfizer patient safet y data entry site.

Edition Number 3
Date 17 July 2017
For overdoses associated with an SAE, standard reporting time lines apply , see 
Section. For other overdoses, reporting should be done within 30 days .
6.5.1. Occupational Exposure
An occupat ional exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not r ecorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
Occupational exposure also includes an exposure during pregnancy  if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant while having been exposed (because of  
environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is 
found to be pregnant after being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, environmental exposure) to the investigational product 
prior to or around the time of conception a nd/or is exposed during his partner’s 
pregnancy . 
The investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer 
product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed 
to a cy totoxic product by i nhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety  using the 
Exposure During 
Pregnancy  (EDP )supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has 
occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted 
should include t he anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related to 
termination of pregnancy).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follo w the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrity  of the terminated fetus should be assessed by  gross visual inspection (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).

Page 69Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  the sponsor.  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants t o identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide t o his 
partner.
6.6.Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to the Pfizer Drug Safety  
Department.
6.6.1. Maternal E xposure
If a patient becomes pregnant duri ng the course of the study , IP should be discontinued 
immediately .
Pregnancy  itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the I P under study  
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormali ties/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.   The 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnanc y, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented 
even if the patient was discontinued from the study .
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site 
personnel informs the Pfizer Drug S afety Department immediately but no later than 
24hours of when he or she becomes aware of it .
PRA works with the I nvestigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the 
Pfizer Drug Safet y Department within 1 or 3 calendar days for SAEs (se
eSection 6.6) and 
within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply  when outcome information is available.
All outcomes of pregnancy  should be reported to the Pfizer Drug Saf ety Department .  An y 
patient who becomes pregnant during the course of the study  will be followed so that 
pregnancy  outcome can be determined and reported to Pfizer and the regulatory  authorities.
A pregnancy  report form ( electronic cop y of the PREGREP form) will be used to report the 
pregnancy  to the Pfizer Drug Safet y Department . The outcome of the pregnancy  will be 
reported on the pregnancy  report form (paper copy  of the PREGOUT form) and provided by  
site staff to the Pfizer Drug Safety  Department , but the outcome of the pregnancy  will not be 
documented in the clinical database.

There is no restriction on fathering children or donating sperm during the study .  Pregnancy  
of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, 
or congenital abnormality) should if possible be followed up and documented.  The outcome 
of an y conception occurring from the date of the first IP administration until 7 days after the 
last I P administration should be followed up and documented.
6.7.Management of Investigational Product -Related Toxicities 
Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhoea has been reported with ceftazidime as with nearly 
all antibacterial agents, and may  range in severit y from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis.  This is 
as a result of alteration of the normal flora of the colon by  ceftazidime leading to overgrowth 
of C.difficile . If C. difficile -associated diarrhoea is suspec ted or confirmed, ongoing 
antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued.  Appropriate fluid 
and electrol yte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and 
surgical evaluation should be institut ed as clinically indicated.
Ceftazidime overdosage has occurred in patients with renal failure.  Reactions have included 
tremors, myoclonus, seizures, encephalopathy , and coma.  Patients who receive an acute 
overdosage should be carefully  observed and give n supportive treatment.  In the presence of 
renal insufficiency , haemodialy sis or peritoneal dialy sis may  aid in the removal of 
ceftazidime from the body.  Continued dosage should be determined b y degree of renal 
impairment, severit y of infection, and susc eptibility  of the causative organisms. 
Cephalosporins may  be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity .  Those at risk include 
patients with renal and hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients 
receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy .  Prothrombin time should be 
monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.
6.8.Study Governance And Oversight
The safet y of all Pfizer clinical studies is closely  monitored on an on- going basis by  the 
Sponsor representatives in consultation with Patient Safety .  Issues identified will be 
addressed; for instance this could involve amendments to the study  protocol and letters to 
Investigators.
6.8.1. Data and Safety Monitoring Board
As this study  is descriptive i n nature, no interim or final inferential anal yses will be 
performed for either efficacy  or safet y.  A Data and Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB ) is 
deemed necessary  since the trial has a long period of enrolment, is multicentre and 
multi- national, and repres ents one of the first safety  and efficacy  trials of CAZ -AVI in 
children.

Page 71The DSMB is charged with reviewing and evaluating the study  safet y (AEs, SAEs, and 
potentially  clinicall y significant laboratory results) at periodic intervals.  The DSMB
members wi ll be familiarised with AEs and SAEs likely  to occur in this patient population, 
based on experience in adults and adolescents, as well as with this class of drugs 
(cephalosporins).  The DSMB will conduct pre -planned and possibl y ad hoc reviews of 
accumula ting data.
Based on the findings of these reviews, the DSMB may make recommendations to Sponsor
regarding the stud y, including, but not limited to: continue the study  without modification, 
modify  the protocol or informed consent/assent document(s), or temp orarily  stop enrolment 
in all or some of the study centres.  The r ecommendations made by  the DSMB to alter the 
conduct of the s tudy will be forwarded to the Sponsor for final decision.  The Sponsor will 
forward such decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate analy ses of endpoint 
events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate. The 
Sponsor will be responsible for discussing and, if considered appropriate, implementing the 
DSMB recommendations.  Further det ails can be found in the DSMB charter.
7. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT AND OTHER TREATM ENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an una pproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33).

Page 74Full details of infusion preparation are given in the Pharmacy  Manua l.
Patients whose CrCl changes during treatment should receive the appropriate dose reduction 
or increase according to Table 5.
Patients whose CrCL  drops below 30 mL /min should be withdrawn from study  therapy .  
Patients withdrawin g from study  therap y can be administered alternative therapies at the 
Investigator’s choice, which should be recorded in the CRF.  If possible, patients should still 
be followed for safety  (see 
Section 3.9.1).  Because the CrCl determination is only  an 
estimate of renal function, in instances where the CrCl is approaching thresholds that would 
require intervention such as a dose change or discontinuation of therapy  (ie CrCL  
approaching 50 or 30 mL/min) , the I nvestigator should use his or her discretion in 
determining (ie confirming the value b y repeat testing, if feasible) whether an immediate 
dose change, a short period of continued observation, or discontinuation of therap y is 
warranted. If in the opinion of the Investigator there is a clinicall y significant reduction in a 
patient’s estimated CrCl during the treatment period, then the Investigator should contact the 
Medical Monitor to discuss the above mentioned options (immediate dose change, a short 
period of continued observation, or discontinuation of therap y).  Additionally , in instances of 
rapidly  changing renal function, the I nvestigator should increase the frequency  of CrCl 
monitoring, depending on the patient’s clinical status, extent of renal function change and 
Investigator’s clinical evaluation.
Patients randomised to receive cefepime should receive the dose, schedule and infusion 
duration as recommended in the local prescribing information or as prescribed by  the 
investigator.  The maximum dose of cefepime in any  single infusion should not exceed 
2000 mg.
7.3.Labelling
Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice and local 
regulatory  guidelines.  Label text will be translated into the local language.
Personnel a t the study  centre will prepare and label the individual I V infusions as assigned by  
the IXRS, and according to the handling instructions.
7.4.Storage
All study  drugs should be kept in a secure place under appropriate storage conditions.  The 
storage condition s will be stated on the study  drug labelling and in the handling instructions.
7.5.Compliance
To ensure that the patient is compliant with administration of study  drug, oral switch therapy , 
and study  procedures, the date and dose of the medication should be re corded in the 
appropriate sections of the CRF.  The site will monitor patient compliance, which will be 
documented in the patient’s source documents, and relevant data will be reported in the CRF.

Page 757.6.Accountability
The study  drug provided for this study will be used only  as directed in the study  protocol.
The study  personnel will account for all study  drugs dispensed to and returned from the 
patient.
The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product supplies.   Study  site personnel, if applicable, 
or the PRA monitor will account for all study  drugs received at the site, unused study  drugs 
and for appropriate destruction.  Certificates of delivery , destruction, and return should be 
signed.  For general drug destruction (eg, left over drug at site) , the investigator must ensure 
that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, 
institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by the Sponsor , and all destruction 
must be adequatel y documented...  Therefore, where at all possible the I P should be 
destroy ed locall y at site and a third part y supplier for return and destruction should only  be 
used where specific country  regulations o r local procedures state this is not possible.  
Documentation should be provided b y PRA or Sponsor identify ing that this is the case. IP 
associated with a recall, Sponsor or its representative will determine what is to be destroy ed, 
but PRA will manage the execution of destruction using standards acceptable to Sponsor or 
its representative.
7.7.Oral 
Switch Therapy
The choice of oral switch therap y, among the options listed below, should be in line with the 
approved and marketed drugs in the respective country , and s hould observe the local specific
regulations and local therapeutic guidelines (if existent), regarding posology.  The decision to 
switch to oral therap y is entirely at the Investigator’s discretion, if the patient has good or 
sufficient clinical respo nse, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.  For the optional 
oral switch therap y, the following should be given: 
Oral ciprofloxacin ( only in countries where its use for children is permitted; 
according to local guidelines, administered at a d ose and formulation per standard of 
care), or
Oral cefixime ( only in countries where its use for children is permitted; according to 
local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care), or
Oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid ( only in countries where its use for children is 
permitted; according to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per 
standard of care), or
Oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim ( only in countries where its use for children is 
permitted; according to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per 
standard of care), or

Page 76Pathogen- based therapy (in discussion with the Medical Monitor) .  The choice of oral 
antibacterial agent for pathogen- based therap y will be driven b y the results of a 
susce ptibility  test, which will be provided tothe Investigator by  either the local or 
central laboratory .  Initiation of pathogen- based therap y is at the Investigator’s 
discretion.  Before administering pathogen -based therap y, the Investigator will 
discuss the results of the susceptibility  test and the selected antibacterial drug (which 
should be approved for use in children) with the Medical Monitor.
The optional oral switch therapies will be sourced locally  by the study  centres or sourced as 
agreed between th e stud y centres and PRA.
Consult the Summary  of Product Characteristics or product package insert, label, and local 
dosing guidelines for further information regarding dosage, administration, storage, 
maximum doses, contraindications, warnings, precautions , and AEs reported.
7.8.Concomitant And Other Treatments
All prescription and over -the-counter medications being taken by  the patients for the 2 weeks 
prior to study  entry  (considered prior treatment) and from enrolment through the L FU visit 
(considered concom itant treatment) must be documented on the appropriate pages of the 
CRF.  Sy stemic antibiotics should be documented for the entire duration of the study  (from 
2weeks prior to stud y entry through the LFU visit).  For patients who are being breast fed, 
all medications taken b y the lactating mother in the previous 2 weeks before the first dose of 
study  therapy  until L FU will also be recorded.
Patients requiring sy stemic prophy lactic antibiotic medication for any  reason at Screening are 
allowed to enter the st udy provided that they  discontinue this medication prior to first dose of 
randomised study  treatment.  Prophy lactic use is prohibited between the time point of first 
dose of study  treatment and the EOT assessment.  Any  violations of this will result in the
patient being assigned an “indeterminate” clinical response at all future clinical outcome 
assessments.  
Prophy lactic use is permitted after EOT until study  end and will not result in a change to the 
patient’s clinical outcome, provided that the patient had not previously  violated the 
aforementioned proph ylactic use criterion between first dose of study  treatment and the EOT 
assessment.
In vitro, avibactam is a substrate of organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and OAT3, which 
might contribute to the active u ptake from the blood compartment and, thereb y its excretion.
Probenecid (a potent OAT inhibitor) inhibits this uptake b y 55% to 70% in vitro and, 
therefore, has the potential to alter the elimination of avibactam when co -dosed.  Since a 
clinical interaction study  of avibactam and probenecid has not been conducted, co-dosing of 
avibactam with probenecid is not recommended.  Patients who meet protocol -specific criteria 
may be switched to oral ciprofloxacin (only in countries where its use for children is

infusion of study  therapy. 
No other oral, intramuscular, or IV concomitant antibacterial treatments are permitted while 
receiving stud y therap y at any time up to the LFU visit.  A patient requiring such 
antibacterial treatments other than the allowed study  therapy  for the treatment of the cUTI 
will be considered a treatment failure.
Other medication, which is considered necessary  for the patient’s safet y and well -being, may  
be given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the 
CRF.  If analgesic medications are needed for pain, the use of analgesic medications without 
antipy retic properties is preferred.  Should a patient require immuno suppressive agents or 
chemotherap y after being randomised to IV study  therap y, the Investigator should contact the 
PRA Medical monitor (as an Sponsor delegate) before initiating therap y.  Continued patient 
study  participation will be determined based upon assessment of the safet y risk to the patient 
if he or she was to continue in the study . Patients who have completed study  therapy  and are 
in the Follow -up Period should remain in the study, as they  are not activel y on study  therapy  
but are being followed for outcomes.
A number of unfavourable reactions with other drugs are known for ceftazidime and 
ciprofloxacin.  Contraindications for these agents and known drug interactions are 
summarised in Table 6.

Page 78Table 6. Contraindications And Drug- Drug interactions
Ciprofloxacin Administration in pregnant or lactating women is contraindicated.
Concurrent administration with tizanidine is contraindicated.
Concurrent administration with methotrexate is not recommended; methotrexate may  inhibit renal tubular 
transport of ciprofloxacin, potentially  leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate and increased risk of
methotrexate -associated toxic reactions.
Concurrent administration with theophy lline decreases theophy lline clearance, resulting in elevated serum
theophy lline levels and increased risk of a patient developing central nervous sy stem or other adverse 
reactions.
Concurrent administration with caffeine or pentoxify lline (oxpentify lline) may  raise serum concent rations of 
these xanthine derivatives.
Concurrent administration with antacids containing magnesium hy droxide or aluminium hy droxide may  
reduce the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by  as much as 90%.
Concurrent administration with probenecid interferes wit
h renal secretion of ciprofloxacin and increases 
ciprofloxacin serum concentrations.
Concurrent administration with pheny toin may  result in increased or reduced serum levels of pheny toin; 
monitoring of drug levels is recommended.
Concurrent administration with warfarin may  augment its anticoagulant effects.  The risk may  vary  with the 
underly ing infection, age, and general status of the patient so that the contribution of a fluoroquinolone to an 
increased INR is difficult to assess.  I t is recommended that INR be monitored frequentl y during and shortly 
after co- administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulant agent.
Concurrent administration with ropinirole increases the maximum plasma concentration of ropinirole by  as 
much as 60%.  Monitoring of r opinirole -related side effects and dose adjustment as appropriate is 
recommended during and shortly  after co -administration with ciprofloxacin.
Concurrent administration with clozapine increases serum concentrations of clozapine and 
N-desmeth ylclozapine, a metabolite, by  as much as 29% and 31%, respectively .  Clinical surveillance and 
appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly  after co -administration with ciprofloxacin are 
recommended.

Page 79Ceftazidime Concurrent administration with chloramph enicol should be avoided.  Chloramphenicol has been shown to be 
antagonistic to β- lactam antibiotics, including ceftazidime.
Concurrent administration with aminogly coside antibiotics or potent diuretics such as furosemide may  result 
in nephrotoxicity.  Because of potential nephrotoxicity  and ototoxicity  of am inogly cosidic antibiotics, renal 
function should be carefully  monitored, especially  if higher dosages of aminogly cosides are to be 
administered or if therapy  is prolonged.
Concurrent administration with combined oral oestrogen/progesterone contraceptives m ay result in lower 
oestrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy  of these contraceptives secondary  to the effects of ceftazidime on 
gut flora.
Cefixime Administration in pregnant or lactating women is not recommended unless clearl y indicated.
Concurrent adm inistration with carbamazepine may  result in increased plasma levels of carbamazepine; 
monitoring of drug levels is recommended. 
Concurrent administration with warfarin and anticoagulants may  increase prothrombin time, with or without 
clinical bleeding.  It is recommended that international normalised ratio (INR) be monitored frequently  during 
and shortly  after co -administration of cefixime with an oral anticoagulant agent. 
Administration of cefixime may  result in a false positive reaction for ketones in the urine with tests using 
nitroprusside but not with those using nitroferricyanide. 
Administration of cefixime may result in a false positive reaction for glucose in the urine using Clinitest®, 
Benedict’s solution, or Fehling’s solution.  I
t is recommend ed that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose 
oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix or TesTape) be used.  A false positive direct Coombs test has been 
reported during treatment with other cephalosporins; therefore, it should be recognised that a positive Coombs 
test may  be due to the drug.

Page 80Amoxicillin -clavul
anic acidConcurrent administration with probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin but does not 
delay  renal excretion of clavulanic acid.  Concurrent use with amoxicillin -clavula nic acid may  result in 
increased and prolonged blood concentrations of amoxicillin.  Co -administration of probenecid is not 
recommended.
Concurrent administration of amoxicillin with oral anticoagulants may  result in abnormal prolongation of 
prothrombin ti me (increased INR).  Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are 
prescribed concurrentl y with amoxicillin -clavulanic acid.  Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may 
be necessary  to maintain the desired level of anticoagula tion.
Concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients 
receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone.
Concurrent administration of oral contraceptives and amoxicillin -clavulanic acid may  affect intestinal flora, 
leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy  of combined oral estrogen/progesterone 
contraceptives.
High urine concentrations of amoxicillin may  result in false -positive reactions when testing for the pre sence 
of glucose in urine using Clinitest®, Benedict's solution, or Fehling's solution.  Since this effect may also 
occur with amoxicillin -clavulanic acid, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzy matic glucose 
oxidase reactions be used.
Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of 
total conjugated estriol, estriol -glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.
Sulfamethoxazole 
–
trimethoprimConcurrent administration w ith ACE inhibitors may  result in hy perkalaemia, possibly  with cardiac 
arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.  Monitoring of serum potassium concentrations is recommended.
Concurrent administration with amantadine may  cause toxic delirium. Monitoring patients for CNS adverse 
reactions is recommended.  If an interaction is suspected, it may  be necessary  to discontinue 1 or both drugs.
Concurrent administration with dofetilide is contraindicated.
Concurrent administration with cy closporine may  cause decreased therapeu tic effect of cy closporine and 
increased risk of nephrotoxicity .  Monitoring of cy closporine blood or plasma concentrations, and serum 
creatinine concentrations is recommended. 
Concomitant administration with digoxin may  increase plasma concentrations, especiall y in elderl y patients. 
Monitoring of digoxin concentrations and dose adjustment as appropriate is recommended.
Concurrent administration with diuretics (eg, thiazides) may  result in increased incidence of 
thrombocy topenia with purpura.  Monitoring o f platelet count is recommended. If an interaction is suspected,

Concurrent administration with alcohol may  produce an alcohol intolerance reaction.  Patients receiving 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may  be advised to avoid drinking alcohol and taking alcohol -containing 
medications.
Concurrent administration with I ndomethacin may  result in elevated sulfamethoxazole blood levels, 
increasing the pharmacologic effects and risk of adverse reactions. 
Concurren t administration with meglitinide may  elevate meglitinide plasma concentrations, increasing the 
risk of hy poglycaemia.  Close monitoring of blood glucose after starting or stopping trimethoprim dose 
adjustment as appropriate is recommended. 
Methenamine is contraindicated for use with sulfonamides.
Concurrent administration with methotrexate may  increase toxicity  of methotrexate.  Trimethoprim may  
increase the risk of methotrexate -induced bone marrow suppression and megaloblastic anaemia. Monitoring 
hematol ogic status is recommended and lowering dose of methotrexate or higher leucovorin rescue dose may  
be needed. 
Concurrent administration with pheny toin may  increase the pharmacologic effects and risk of toxicity .  
Monitoring of phenytoin concentrations and toxicity  and dose adjustment as appropriate is recommended.
Concurrent administration with procainamide may increase the pharmacologic effects and risk of toxicity . 
Monitoring of procainamide and its metabolite, N
-acetylprocainamide and cardiac function an d dose 
adjustment as appropriate is recommended.
Concurrent administration with py rimethamine may  increase the risk of megaloblastic anaemia.  Assessment 
for haematologic and neurologic manifestations of megaloblastic anaemia, if an interaction is suspecte d, 
corrective treatment (eg, folic acid if indicated) and if necessary  discontinuation of 1 or both drugs is 
recommended.
Concurrent administration with sulfones (eg, dapsone) may  increase the pharmacologic effects and toxicity  of 
both agents.  Monitoring plasma concentrations of both agents and patients for sulfone toxicit y (eg, 
methemoglobinaemia) is recommended.  Adjust doses or discontinue therapy as necessary.
Concurrent administration with sulfony lureas may increase hy pogly caemic response.  Monitoring of blood 
glucose and dose adjustment as appropriate as needed is recommended.
Concomitant administration of thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) may  increase the risk of h ypoglycaemia 
and other adverse reactions.  Monitoring of blood glucose and for othe r adverse reactions, dose adjustment as 
appropriate is recommended.

Page 837.8.1. Drug -Drug Interactions
Drug -antibiotic interactions occur with man y medications commonly prescribed in children, 
particularl y those drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.  Therefore, extra caution is adv ised 
in the event that concomitant medications need to be changed or added for children.
7.8.2. Other Concomitant Treatment
Other medication other than that described above, which is considered necessary  for the 
patient ’s safet y and well -being, may  be given at th e discretion of the Investigator and 
recorded in the appropriate sections of the CRF.
8.STATISTICAL ANALYSES
8.1.Statistical Considerations
All personnel involved with the analy sis of the study  will remain blinded until database -lock.  
Analy ses will be performe d by Sponsor or its representatives.  
A comprehensive Statistical Anal ysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared prior to the randomisation 
of the first patient to the study .  An y subsequent amendments to the SAP will be documented, 
with final amendments completed prior to unblinding of the data for the analy sis.
8.2.Sample Size Estimate
Patients will continue to be recruited into this study until 80 patients complete at least 
72hours (3 full day s, ie, 9 doses if given 3 times daily , or 6 doses if given twice dail y) of
study  treatment (deemed to be evaluable patients).  Patients will be randomised 3:1 to the 
CAZ -AVI or cefepime study  treatment groups.  At least 60 and 20 evaluable patients, 
respectivel y, are required in the CAZ -AVI and cefepime groups.
The proposed samp le size is based on the probability  of observing a ‘rare’ safet y event.  
Safety  data from this study  and from Study  D4280C00015 for cIAI will be combined for 
analysis.  As a total of at least 120 patients will be treated with CAZ -AVI in both studies 
combin ed, when assuming an underl ying incidence rate of 3% for a specific ‘rare’ event, this 
will ensure that the probability  of observing such an event in at least 1 patient treated with 
CAZ -AVI exceeds 95%.
In addition, each of the patient cohorts is required to have a minimum number of evaluable 
patients as follows:
Cohort 1: At least 6:2 evaluable patients aged from 12 y ears to <18 years;
Cohort 2: At least 6:2 evaluable patients aged from 6 y ears to <12 years;
Cohort 3: At least 9:3 evaluable patients aged f rom 2 y ears to <6 years;

Cohort 4b: At least 6:2 evaluable patients aged from 3 months to <1 y ear, with 
a minimum of 3 patients with at least 1 PK sample aged from 3 months to 
<6months treated with CAZ -AVI.
The inclusion of more patients in the y ounger age cohorts (Cohorts 3, 4a, and 4b) compared 
to Cohorts 1 and 2 was based on epidemiological data.
Considering patients over all cohorts combined, at least 10% of evaluable patients with 
urological abnormalities in the urinary  tract should be included.
8.3.Definitions of Analysis Sets
The anal ysis of data will be based on diffe rent analy sis sets according to the purpose of 
analysis, ie, for safet y and efficacy.  The decision regarding validity of data for each of the 
analysis sets will be based on a blinded review of data, which will occur prior to declaring 
database lock.
8.3.1. Safet y 
Analysis Set
The Safet y anal ysis set will include all randomised patients who received any  amount of IV 
study  therapy  (ie, CAZ -AVI or cefepime).  For the Safet y analysis set, patients will be 
included in all outputs according to the study  treatment they  actuall y received.
8.3.2. Safety Evaluable Analysis Set
The safet y evaluable analy sis set will be a subset of the patients in the Safety  analy sis set that 
received at least 9 doses of study  treatment if given 3 times daily , or at least 6 doses if given 
twice dail y.  Each subject’s dosing profile will be reviewed b y the evaluability  review 
committee to confirm whether the scheduling and number of doses received is acceptable for 
inclusion in the safety  evaluable analy sis set.
8.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set
The PK ana lysis set will be a subset of the patients in the Safety  anal ysis set who have at 
least 1 ceftazidime and/or avibactam plasma measurement available.
8.3.4. Efficacy Analysis Sets
The efficacy
 anal ysis of data in this study  will be based on 4 analy sis sets of pati ents 
(intent -to-treat [ITT], microbiological ITT [micro- ITT], clinically  evaluable [CE] ,and 
microbiologically  evaluable [ME] analy sis sets) as defined in Section 8.3.4.1 to Section 
8.3.4.4.  Each of these analy sis sets will be defined separately  for each of the visits at which 
efficacy  is assessed.

8.5.Methods For Statistical Analyses
8.5.1. Analysis Of The Primary Variables
The primary  variables are for safet y and tolerability.  No inferential statistical tests will be 
performed for an y safety variables.  All data will be presented b y treatment group and by 
cohort (and also by  summed cohorts).  Descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard 
deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for continuous variables, 
and counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables.  Demog raphic data ,
other baseline characteristic data, and concomitant medications will also be summarised.
Safety  assessments will be based on AE reports and the results of vital sign measurements, 
physical examinations, ECGs and clinical laboratory  tests.  For each safet y variable, the last 
assessment made prior to the first dose of stud y drug will be defined as the baseline.  All 
safet y data collected f rom this study  up to the LFU visit will be presented within the Safety  
analysis set ( as defined in Section 8.3.1) by  the received study  treatment group (ie, for 
CAZ -AVI or cefepime), irrespective of whether the patient switched to oral therap y. Key 
safet y data reported up to the L FU visit will also be summarised for the Safety evaluable 
analysis set (ie, those who received at least 72 hours of study treatment as defined in

prior review has identified groupings of specific AE preferred terms from the MedDRA 
vocabulary , will also be tabulated by  cohort:
Liver disorder ;
Diarrhoea ;
Hypersensitivity /anaphy laxis ;
Haematological disorder ;
Renal disorder .
The number of patients with at least 1 AE within each AEoSI topic group will be presented 
by study  treatment group, together with a further presentation of the AE incidence r ates for 
each PT within each AEoSI  topic group.
8.5.1.2. Other Safety Data
Summaries and listings of data for vital signs, clinical laboratory  and urinaly sis laboratory  
tests, ECGs and phy sical examination findings will be presented.  Appropriate data will be 
summa rised for the observed value at each scheduled assessment and for the corresponding 
change from Baseline.  
For clinical laboratory  tests, listings of patient data will also flag up an y abnormal or 
out-of- range values.  Potentially  clinicall y significant c hanges in the laboratory  test 
parameters will also be identified, listed, and summarised at scheduled visits.  This summary  
will present data for patients meeting the criteria at any  time during the study  up to the EOT 
visit, and separatel y at any time up to the L FU visit.  Clinical laboratory  data will be reported 
in Sy stème International units.
The foll owing number of patients meeting the following criteria at an y time during the study 
up to the L FU visit will be assessed: (maximum ALT ≥3×ULN or maximum AST ≥3×ULN) 
and(maximum total bilirubin ≥2×ULN).  The AST, ALT, total bilirubin elevations can occur 
at an y time in the specific review period and do not need to occur simultaneously.
For ECG variables, the QT correction factor will be based on both the Bazett and Fridericia 
formulae (QT cB and QT cF).  Categorical summaries of absolute QT, QT cB and QT cF values 
(≥450 ms, ≥480 ms, ≥500 ms) and change from Day  1 (Baseline) values in QT, QT cB and 
QTcF values ( ≥30ms, ≥60ms), and additionally  the number and percentage of patients who 
have a post -baseline value of ≥500 ms with a change from Day  1 of ≥60ms will be presented 
by treatment, visit and cohort.  The number of patients meeting these criteria at any  time after 
the start of study  treatment until the L FU visit will also be summarised by  treatment and 
cohort.

The number and percentage of patients with CrCl in the following ranges <30 mL /min, 30 to 
50 mL /min, >50 mL /min will be tabulated at each of the TOC and LFU visits for each 
treatment group.
8.5.2. Analysis Of The Secondary Variable (s)
No inferential statistical tests will be performed for any  secondary  variabl es.
8.5.2.1. Pharmacokinetic Outcome Variables
A listing of ceftazidime and avibactam concentrations at the nominal sampling windows by  
patient and cohort will be provided.  For Cohorts 1 to 4b, the plasma concentration will be 
summarised by  nominal sampling time w indow using appropriate descriptive statistics (eg, 
number, mean, SD, minimum, median, maximum, geometric mean, lower and upper SD 
bounds [geometric mean ±SD], and coefficient of variation).
In addition, the avibactam and ceftazidime concentration, paediat ric patient demographics, 
and disease status data from Cohorts 1 to 4 bwill be combined with the data from appropriate 
previous clinical studies in paediatric patients and/or adults for a population PK analysis.  
The actual dosing and plasma sampling times will be used for the anal ysis.  The developed 
population PK model may  be used to conduct simulations to determine probability  of PK/PD 
target attainment to help to justify  the CAZ -AVI dose regimens for paediatric patient with 
cUTI.  A stand -alone populati on PK modelling and simulation analy sis plan will be prepared 
and the results will be reported in a stand -alone report outside of the CSR.
Avibactam and ceftazidime PK parameters derived from population PK analy sis and 
potential PK/PD relationships will be reported separatel y. 
8.5.2.2. Clinical Outcome Definitions
Clinical response outcomes will be summarised by visit, treatment ,and cohort in each of the 
CE and ME anal ysis sets at End of 72 hours’ treatment, EOIV, EOT, TOC, and L FU,as well 
as the ITT and micro -ITT anal ysis sets .  A clinical failure occurring at the EOIV timepoint or 
later will alway s be carried forward to any  subsequent assessment time.  The Blinded 
Observer will make the assessment of clinical outcome.
For each baseline pathogen identified with s ufficient frequency , the number and percentage 
of patients in each treatment group and cohort classified as having a favourable clinical 
outcome for the particular pathogen will also be summarised.

9.STUDY AND DATA MANAG EMENT 
9.1.Training of Study Site Personnel
Before the first patient is entered into the stud y, a PRA representative will review and discuss 
the requireme nts of the Clinical Study  Protocol and related documents with the 
investigational staff and also train them in an y study specific procedures and the PRA 
Datalabs data capture s ystem.
The Principal Investigator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study  is given 
to all of these staff, and that an y new information relevant to the performance of this study is 
forwarded to the staff involved.
The Principal Investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study  
(medical, nu rsing and other staff).
9.2.Monitoring of The Study
During the study , an Sponsor representative will have regular contacts with the study site, 
including visits to:
Provide information and support to the Investigator(s) ;
Confirm that facilities remain acceptab le;
Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accuratel y and timel y recorded in the CRFs, that biological samples are handled in 
accordance with the Laboratory  Manual and that study  drug accountabilit y checks ar e 
being performed ;
Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the CRFs with the 
patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the 
study ) including verification of informed consent/assent of particip ating patients.

Drug Substance 
Study  Code AZ /Pfizer C3591005
Edition Number 3
Date 17 July 2017
This will require direct access to all original records for each patient (eg, clinic 
charts) ;
Ensure withdrawal of informed consent/assent to the use of the patient’s biological 
samples is reported and biological samples are identified and disposed of/destroy ed 
accordingl y, and the action is documented, and reported to the patient.
The Sponsor representative will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other 
staff at the centre needs information and advice about the study  cond uct.
9.2.1. Source D ata
Refer to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA) for location of source data.   In most cases, the 
source documents are the hospital or the phy sician subject chart.  In these cases, data 
collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts . 
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at the Sponsor that clearl y identifies those data 
that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will sta nd as the source document.
9.2.2. Study Agreements
The Principal Investigator at each/the centre should comply  with all the terms, conditions, 
and obligations of the CSA, or equivalent, for this study .  In the event of any  inconsistency  
between this Clinical Stud y Protocol and the CSA, the terms of Clinical Study  Protocol shall 
prevail with respect to the conduct of the stud y and the treatment of patients and in all other 
respects, not relating to study  conduct or treatment of patient s, the terms of the CSA shall 
prevail.
Agreements between Sponsor or Sponsor ’s representatives, and the Principal I nvestigator 
should be in place before any  study -related procedures can take place, or patient s are 
enrolled.
9.2.3. Archiving Of Study Documents
The Investigator follows the prin ciples outlined in the CSA.
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subj ects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CR Fs and hospital records), all original signed 
informed consent[/assent] documents, copies of all CRFs, safety  reporting forms, source 
documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of 
relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The 
records should be retained by  the investigator according to the I CH guidelines, according to 
local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study  agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.

Page 98If the invest igator becomes unable for any  reason to continue to retain study  records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as anoth er 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  Pfizer.  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 y ears after completion or 
discontinuation of the study  or fo r longer if required by applicable local regulations.  
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
9.2.3.1. Data Handling And Record Keeping
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator ha s ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, comple te, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  the investigator or by  an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs are true.  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
9.3.Study Timetable And End Of Study
The end of the stud y in all participating countries is defined as ‘the last visit of the la st 
patient undergoing the study ’or date of study  closure in the case of earl y study  termination, 
whichever date is later.
The study  is expected to start in Q 32015 and to end by  Q3 2018.
The study  may  be terminated at individual centres if the study  proce dures are not being 
performed according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), or if recruitment is slow.  Sponsor
may also terminate the entire study  prematurel y if concerns for safet y arise within this study  
or in any  other study  with CAZ -AVI.
9.4.Sponsor Disconti nuation Criteria
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/EC, or investigational product safety  problems, or at the 
discretion of the Sponsor.  I n addition, the Sponsor retains t he right to discontinue 
development of CAZ -AVI at an y time.

notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and the hospital pharmacy  
(ifapplicable) within seven day s.  As directed b y the Sponsor, all study  materials must be 
collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.
9.5.Data Management 
The PRA Datalabs s ystem will be used for data collection and query  handling.  The 
Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the CRFs as specified in the study  protocol 
and in accordance with the instructions provided.
The Investigator ensures the accuracy , completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and 
the provision of an swers to data queries according to the CSA.  The I nvestigator will sign the 
completed CRFs.  A copy of the completed CRFs will be archived at the study  site.
Data management will be performed b y PRA , according to the Clinical I nformatics Plan.  
Adverse eve nts and medical/surgical history  will be classified according to the terminology  
of the latest version of the MedDRA.  Medications will be classified according to the 
Sponsor Drug Dictionary.  All coding will be performed by  the PRA coding group.  Data 
queries will be raised for inconsistent, impossible or missing data.  All entries to the study  
database will be available in an audit trail.
The data will be validated as defined in the Clinical I
nformatics Plan and Edit Specifications 
Document.  Qualit y cont rol procedures will be applied to each stage of data handling to 
ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed correctl y.  The Clinical Informatics 
Plan will also clarify  the roles and responsibilities of the various functions and personnel 
involved in the data management process.
When all data have been coded, validated, signed and locked, clean file will be declared.  
Any treatment revealing data may  thereafter be added and the final database will be locked.
Serious Adverse Event Reconciliation
Serious adverse event reconciliation reports are produced and reconciled with the patient 
safet y database and/or the investigational site.  SAE reconciliation between safet y data and 
clinical data will be performed by  PRA.  The frequency  depends on the e xpected volume of 
SAE reports and will be defined in the AE/SAE Reconciliation Plan.  
Management of external data
The data collected through third party  sources will be obtained and reconciled against study  
data.

version of the ICF and Assent Form, is approve d by the national regulatory  authorit y or a 
notification to the national regulatory  authority  is done, according to local regulations. The 
only circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to I RB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  toeliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
The Sponsor or PRA will handle the distribution of any  of these documents to the nati onal 
regulatory  authorities.
The Sponsor or PRA will provide Regulatory  Authorities, I ECs/IRBs and Principal 
Investigators with safet y updates/reports according to local requirements.
Each Principal Investigator is responsible for providing the I ECs/IRB wi th reports of an y 
serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any  other study  conducted with the I P.  
PRA will provide this information to the Principal Investigator so that he/she can meet these 
reporting requirements.
10.4. Informed C onsent
The informe d consent documents and any  subject recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including 
applicable privacy  laws.  The Principal Investigator(s) at each centre will:
Ensure each patient' s parent(s) or other legall y acceptable representative(s) and 
patient when applicable (if age appropriate according to local regulations) is given 
full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk 
and benefit of the study ;
Ensure each patient's parent(s) or other legall y acceptable representative(s) and 
patient when applicable (if age appropriate according to local regulations) is notified 
that they  are free to discontinue from the study  at any  time ;
Ensure that each pa tient's parent(s) or other legally acceptable representative(s) and 
patient when applicable (if age appropriate according to local regulations) is given the 
opportunity  to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided ;
Ensure each pat ient’s parent(s) or other legall y acceptable representative(s) provides 
signed and dated informed consent and patient (if age appropriate according to local 
regulations) provides signed and dated assent before conducting an y procedure 
specificall y for the study ;
Ensure the original, signed I CF(s) and Assent Form (if age appropriate according to 
local regulations) is/are stored in the Investigator’s Study  File;

Ensure that an y reimbursement for study  visits as any  provisions for patients harmed 
as a consequence of study  participation are described in the I CF(s) and Assent Form
(if age appropriate according to local regulations) that is approved by  an IEC/I RB.
10.5. Changes To The Protocol And Informed Consent Form
Study  procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the International 
co-ordinating Investigator and Sponsor.
If there are an y substantial changes to the stud y protocol, then these changes will be 
documented in a stud y protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study 
protocol (Revised Clinical Study  Protocol).
The amendment is to be approv ed by the relevant IEC/IRB and if applicable, also the 
national regulatory  authority  approval, before implementation.  L ocal requirements are to be 
followed for revised protocols.
Sponsor or its representative will distribute any  subsequent amendments and new versions of 
the protocol to each Principal Investigator (s). For distribution to I EC/IRB see Section 10.3.
If a protocol amendment requires a change to a centre’s ICF and/or Assent Form, th e Sponsor
or its representative and the centre’s IEC/IRB are to approve the revised ICF and/or Assent 
Form (if applicable) before the revised form(s) is/are used. 
If local regulations require, an y administrative change will be communicated to or approved 
by each IEC/IRB.
10.6. Audits and I nspections
Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study  conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This 
verification may  also occur after study
 completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  completion, authorised representatives of Pfizer, or 
companies working on behalf of Pfizer , a regulatory  authority , or an IEC/IRB may  perform 
audits or inspections at the centre, in cluding source data verification.  The purpose of an 
audit or inspection is to sy stematically  and independently  examine all study -related activities 
and documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were 
recorded, analy sed, and 
accurately  reported according to the protocol, GCP, guidelines of the

agent immediately  if contacted by  a regulatory  agency  about an inspection at the centre.  
Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the 
investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be 
present during the inspection.  The investigator site and investigator w ill promptly  resolve 
any discrepancies that are identified between the study  data and the subject's medical records.  
The investigator will promptly  provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent.  
Before response submission to the regula tory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer 
or its agents with an opportunity  to review and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visi ts and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
10.7. Reporting Of Safety Issues And Serious Breaches Of The Protocol Or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable
regulatory  authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.  
In addition, the i nvestigator will inform Pfizer immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of .

International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 3 
categories (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances
.htm). For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edition 
(2005).  Infectious substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category  B or 
Exempt.  There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Categor y AInfectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure 
to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability , life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy  humans or animals.  Category  A pathogens are eg, Ebola, L assa fever 
virus:
are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category  A.  Category  B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, an d E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) t ypes 1 and 2.  They  are assigned the following UN 
number and proper shipping name:
UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -all other materi als with minimal risk of containing pathogens
Clinical trial samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulations
Clinical trial samples will routinely  be packed and transported at ambient temperature 
in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
(http://w ww.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.ht
m)
Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry -ice content
IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packi ng and 
transportation and packing should be done b y an IATA certified person, as applicable
Samples routinely  transported by  road or rail are subject to local regulations which 
require that they are also packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way to 
contain an y risk of infection or contamination by using approved couriers and 
packaging / containment materials at all times.  The IATA 650 biological sample 
containment standards are encouraged wherever possible when road or rail transport 
is used.

1. INTRODUCTION
During the course of the study  the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at an y point during the study .
The Investigator participates, together with Sponsor clinical project representatives, in review 
and assessment of cases meeting PHL  criteria to agree whether Hy ’s Law (HL) criteria are 
met.  HL  crite ria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) caused by  the Investigational 
Medicinal Product (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL /HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
2. DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) and Total Bilirubin (TBL ) ≥ 2xULN irrespective of an increase in Alkaline 
Phosphatase (ALP), at any  point during the study  following the start of study  medication.  
The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a specified time frame.

Page 109Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN andTBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can 
be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated AL P indicating cholestasis , 
viral hepatitis, another drug.  The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a 
specified time frame.
For PHL  and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie , on 
the same day ) the elevation in TBL , but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
3. IDENTIFICATION OF PO TENTIAL HY’S LAW CAS ES
In order to identify  cases of PHL  it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who meets an y of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
ALT ≥ 3xULN
AST 
≥ 3xUL N
TBL  ≥ 2xULN
When the identification criteria are met from laboratory  results the Investigator will without 
delay :
Determine whether the patient m eets PHL  criteria (see Section 2 of this Appendix for 
definition) by  reviewing laboratory  reports from all previous visits (including both 
central and local laboratory  results)
The Investigator will without delay  review eac h new laboratory  report and if the 
identification criteria are met will:
Notify  the Sponsor representative ;
Determine whether the patient meets PHL  criteria (see Section 2 of this Appendix for 
definition) by  reviewing labor atory  reports from all previous visits ;
Promptly  enter the laboratory  data into the laboratory  CRF .
4. FOLLOW -UP
4.1. Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met

provided in the Clinical Study  Protocol.
4.2. Potential Hy’s Law Criteria M et
If the patient does meet PHL  criteria the Investigator will:
Notify  the Sponsor representative who will then inform the central Study  Team
TheMedical Monitor contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the stud y patients’ follow -up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact the Investigator will:
Monitor the patient until liver bioc hemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically  
indicated .  The patient should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon 
as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This 
evaluation should include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and ph ysical assessment.   
Investigate the etiolog y of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the medical monitor.  In addit
ion to repeating measurements of AST 
and ALT and TBili, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), 
direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma- glutamy l transferase (GGT), prothrombin time 
(PT)/international normalized ratio (I NR), total bile a cids, alkaline phosphatase and 
acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  Consideration should also be given 
to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for 
further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the 
recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed history , including 
relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by  itself or as 
a coformulated product in prescription or over- the-counter medications) , recreational 
drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , travel 
history , history  of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occup ational exposure to chemicals, should 
be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver 
imaging (eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of 
AST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI 
(Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has y et been found.  
Such potential DILI (Hy’s l aw) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of 
availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine 
etiology of the LFT abnormalities.

5. REVIEW AND ASSESS MENT OF POTENTIAL HY ’S LAW CASES
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry  abnormality  was initially  detected, the Study  
Medical Monitor contacts the I nvestigator in order to review available data and agree on 
whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL  criteria other than DILI caused 
by the IMP .  The Sponsor Medical Monitor and Global Safety  Physician will also be 
involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.  
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the I nvestigator will follow the 
instruction s below.
If there isan agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequentl y 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingl y and follow the Pfizer standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanation tha t would explain the ALT or AST and TBL  
elevations other than the IMP:
Update the report of the prior reported SAE (report term now ‘H y’s Law’) according 
to Pfizer standard processes. 
The ‘Medically  Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other s erious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.

3.1.1 Zenith® p-Branch ™ 
 
The Zenith® p-Branch ™ is a modular system (Fi gure 3.1) constructed of full -thickness woven polyester 
fabric sewn to self -expanding stainless steel and nitinol Z-stents, and is introduced using the Zenith® 
preloaded delivery system (Figures 3.2 and 3.3).  Three fenestrations and a scallop in the graft material 
preserve blood flow to the renal and visceral vessels.   The two renal artery fenestrations are conical -
shaped and may be manipulated to accommodate a range of renal anatomies with a single design.  The 
endovascular graft is available in two fenestration/scallop configurations (A and B) to provide an 
optimal fit for individual patient anatomies (Figures 3.4 and 3.5).  Refer to the Manufacturer’s 
Instructions for Use (IFU) for the device sizes available  and planning and sizing information for t he 
clinical investigation.

6.0 Design of the Clinical Investigation  
 
6.1 Type of Investigation  
This prospective, non- randomized, multicenter clinical investigation  will evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of the the Zenith® p-Branch™ in combination with Atrium iCAST ™ covered stents for the 
treatment of pararenal or juxtarenal aortic aneurysms.   This st udy will enroll 80 patients at up to 30  
clinical sites.  Patient enrollment is expected to be completed within 2 .5 years of study initiation.  
Follow-up data will be collected for 5 years post-procedure.  The total study duration should be 
approximately 7.5 years.  
 
6.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Assessment of selection criteria will be based upon data available pre-operatively.  Data obtained peri-
operatively and post -operatively (including the results from core laboratory analysis of pre -procedure

violation of the Clinical Investigation Plan and should not be construed as evidence of inadequate or inaccurate pre- operative assessment with respect to the enrollment criteria or evidence of inappropriate 
enrollment.  Enrollment is to be based upon best available pre- operative data.  Some criteria relate to 
subjective assessment while other criteria are considered absolute and are able to be determined

6.3 Endpoints 
6.3.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary safety and effectiveness endpoint is treatment success at 12 months.  Treatment success is 
defined as technical success and f reedom from all of the following at 12 months: 
• Type I or Type III endoleaks  that require intervention post- discharge (including T ype I and 
Type III endoleaks identified for treatment on the 12 month follow -up CT); 
• Aneurysm growth > 0.5 cm; 
• AAA related seri ous adverse event s (i.e., death, rupture, or conversion to open surgical 
repair)  as adjudicated by an independent CEC; 
• AAA- related major complication s (i.e., renal failure requiring permanent dialysis; bowel 
obstruction, ischemia, or fistula ; stroke with permanent deficit ; or paral ysis) as adjudicated 
by an independent CEC. 
 
6.3.2 Secondary Endpoints 
The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated for descriptive purposes (not for the purpose of 
statistical  inference) :  
• Myocardial infarction  
• Congestive heart failure  
• Cardiac ischemia requiring intervention  
• Visceral  vessel events  
• Changes in aneurysm size 
• Secondary interventions 
Cook Research Incorporated  
Zenith® p-Branch™ Pivotal Study   Page 23 of 47  
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 14 -09-03 
 • Endoleak 
• Device migration  
• Device patency  
• Device integrity  
 
6.3.3 Rationale for Endpoints 
The primary endpoint incorporates the measures relevant to fully evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
the Zenith® p-Branch™.  Specifically, success first requires graft deployment in the intended location 
with patency of all ves sels targeted by a fenestration ( i.e., technical success) .  A patient must be free 
from T ype I endoleak requiring intervention, which is relevant given that the device is intended to 
provide aneurysm exclusion.  Likewise, a patient must be free from T ype I II endoleak requiring 
intervention, which is relevant given the use of covered stents in contributing to sealing of the aneurysm 
at the junction with a fenestration.  Not only must patients be free from AAA -related serious adverse 
events (death rupture, or conversion to open surgical repair) , but they must also be free from major 
complications (stroke with permanent deficit and paralysis ) and related events specific to the target 
vessels (e.g., renal failure requiring dialysis, bowel obstruction, ischemia , or fistula).  
 
6.4 Variables to be Measured to Demonstrate Achievement of Endpoints  
The safety and effectiveness endpoint measured by treatment success at 12 months will be assessed by  
collecting and analyzing the following data: 
• Technical success will be determined by collecting deployment information and procedural 
angiography; 
• Type I and III endoleaks  will be assessed by CT at each follow -up visit; 
• Aneurysm growth >0.5 cm will be assessed by comparing the maximum aneurysm diameter  
measurement on each follow -up CT (post- procedure CT measurement should be conside red 
baseline) ; 
• SAE s and major complications will be assessed by clinical exams at each follow up.  
 Independent core laboratories (to be designated) will be used to provide detailed analysis for data 
collected (e.g., angiographic, ultrasound, CT, X–ray, and MRI).  The clinical data and imaging measurements will be collected on standardized CRFs, which may serve as source documents.  The schedule for assessments is summarized in Table 6.1.

3 Device X -rays may be requested to provide more focused imaging if potential device integrity issues are identified, 
but are unable to be confirmed, using CT.  
4Imaging should be performed within 6 months of the procedure, with imaging within 3 months of the procedure 
considered to be optimum.  
5 Duplex ultrasound and non -contrast CT may be used for those patients experiencing documented renal failure or 
who are otherwise unable to undergo a contrast -enhanced CTA scan.   
6 In cases of reinterventions for sten osis/occlusion of a branch vessel targeted by a fenestration, duplex ultrasound 
should be performed prior to the reintervention procedure.  
7 Required blood tests include creatinine, BUN, AST, and ALT.  
 
 
6.5 Measures to be Taken to Avoid or Minimize Bias  
This clinical investigation is not randomized or blinded.  It is intended to collect information regarding 
physician use of the Zenith® p-Branch™.  The study will utilize uniform definitions for study endpoints, 
event adjudication by an independent clinical events committee, and imaging data analysis by a centralized core laboratory.  Study results will be analyzed in accordance with a prospectively defined analysis plan. 
 
7.0 Methods  
 
7.1 Patient Assessment, Screening, and Consent Patients will be screened to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion 
criteria.  Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of  the exclusion criteria will be 
invited to participate in this investigation.  All patients eligible for entry into the investigation will have the Clinical Investigation Plan explained to them, as well as the potential risks and benefits of their 
participation in the investigation.  Each patient who agrees to participate, or a le gally authorized 
representative, will be required to sign an informed consent document prior to the procedure.  If new 
Cook Research Incorporated

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 14 -09-03 
 information is obtained after a patient receives treatment with the device, patients who have not exited 
the study will be informed about the new information, and will be re -consented at the discretion of the 
investigator and/or the site’s IRB.  
 
7.2 Point of Enrollment 
Point of enrollment will be based on the intent- to-treat population and is defined to include any patient 
for whom the trea tment procedure is initiated.  More specifically, the patient would be included in the 
intent- to-treat population upon procedure initiation (i.e., cutdown or initiation of percutaneous access).  
Informed consent will be obtained and assessment of the patie nt’s conformance to the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will occur prior to the procedure.  
 7.3 Medications 
The hospital’s standard protocol should be followed with respect to medication.  Dual anti -platelet 
therapy is recommended for three  months following the index endovascular procedure or after a 
secondary intervention involving the visceral vessels.  Aspirin therapy is recommended indefinitely.   7.4 Pre-procedure 
Planning and sizing of the Zenith
® p-Branch ™ endovascular graft is completed pre-operatively  based on 
radiologic assessments, including CTA.    
7.5 Procedure 
Each patient will receive one Zenith
® p-Branch ™ endovascular graft in combination with  Atrium 
iCAST ™ stents for the SMA and renal fenestrations.  Use of t he Zenith® Universal Distal Body 
Endovascular Graft is dependent on patient anatomy and physician discretion.  For example, in i nstances 
where a surgically implanted graft has been previously placed  in the aorta, the Zenith® Universal Distal 
Body Endovascular Graft may not be required if an adequate distal seal within the prior graft is obtained 
with the Zenith® p-Branch™.  Commercially available Zenith® Spiral-Z® AAA Iliac Leg Grafts will be 
used.  The Manufacturers’ Instruc tions for Use should be referred to for additional information.  
Standard techniques for placement of arterial access sheaths, guiding catheters, angiographic catheters, and wire guides should be employed during use of the Zenith
® p-Branch ™.  The device and delivery 
system are compatible with 0.035 inch diameter wire guides.   
Refer to institutional protocols relating to anesthesia, anticoagulation, access technique, and monitoring 
of vital signs  during the procedure .    
Cook Research Incorporated  
Zenith® p-Branch™ Pivotal Study   Page 26 of 47  
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 14 -09-03 
 The completion imaging should be car efully interrogated for potential endoleaks as well as residual 
kinking/stenosis /dissection  of vessels accommodated by fenestrations.  Use of imaging  modalities 
beyond conventional angiography (e.g., rotational angiography [i.e., flat -panel volume CT or cone beam 
CT] or IVUS ) is recommended to fully assess the completeness of repair  and c onfirm the absence of 
Type I and Type III endoleaks as well as stent compression or kinking /stenosis/dissection  of vessels 
accommodated by a fenestration, especially at the  distal end of a fenestration stent.    
Type I and T ype III endoleaks not expected to resolve with the reversal of procedural heparin warrant 
treatment prior to completion of the endovascular procedure.  Likewise, any evidence of kinking, 
stenosis, or dissection of vessels accommodated by fenestrations should be resolved prior to completion of the procedure.  In such cases of either Type I or Type III endoleak or residual 
kinking/stenosis/dissection of vessels accommodated  by a fenestration, additional stenting or balloon 
angioplasty should be considered.  
Refer to the Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use for complete details regarding use  of the Zenith
® p-
Branch ™.  Fluoroscopic guidance and angiography should be used throughout the procedure to verify 
positioning of the device with respect to patient anatomy.  
 7.6  Post-procedure/Follow-up 
The results of the endovascular repair will be ass essed by clinical and imaging evaluation intra-
operatively and post -operatively, including within 30-days post-procedure, and at 6 months (180 ± 30 
days), 12 months (365 ± 45 days), 2 years (730 ± 60 days), 3 years (1095 ± 60 days), 4 years (1460 ± 90 
days), and 5 years (1825 ± 90 days) post- procedure according to the study schedule (Table 6.1).  Follow-
up windows are intended as guidelines only.  They are not absolute and are not intended to limit data collection due to scheduling conflicts.   
Type I and Type III endoleaks detected during follow- up warrant treatment, particularly in the setting of 
aneurysm growth.  Type II endoleaks should be treated at the physician’s discretion, depending on 
aneurysm behavior and size, endoleak source, and tim e from implantation.  If the aneurysm is enlarging, 
treatment by embolization or ligation should be considered.  Type I and Type III endoleaks should be 
treated with additional ballooning or prostheses. 
The patency of vessels accommodated by fenestrations should be assessed at each follow -up.  
Additional ballooning and/or stenting may be warranted in the setting of stenosis (e.g., > 60%) or 
occlusion.  In cases of reinterventions for stenosis/occlusion of a branch vessel targeted by a 
fenestration, duplex ultrasound should be performed prior to the reintervention procedure, and is 
suggested to be performed after the reintervention procedure, as per the standard of care for the site.  
 
7.7 Reintervintion  
Reintervention should be performed according to the ins titution’s standard of care.

CIP 14 -09-03 
 7.8 Duration of Study and Patient Participation  
The total duration of patient participation is 5 years.  After graft deployment, follow -up data will 
continue to be collected for 5 years for each patient in the clinical investig ation. 
 
7.9    Criteria and Procedures for Withdrawal  
A patient may decide to withdraw from the investigation at any time either before or after undergoing 
the procedure without prejudice or loss of care.  The patient should notify the investigator of thei r desire 
to withdraw.  The investigator will notify the Sponsor.  The investigator may also decide to withdraw a patient from the investigation at any time based on medical judgment.  In these instances  of withdrawal, 
data collected up to the time of patient withdrawal, including the Study E xit form shall be submitted to 
the Data Coordinating Center, and will include the reason why the patient has been withdrawn from the study.  Any data collected on the patient up to the point of withdrawal may be used i n the study.  
In the event a patient is lost to follow -up or cannot be contacted for post- treatment assessments, at least 
three attempts will be made to locate the patient, and these efforts will be documented.  If the patient cannot be located, a lost to f ollow- up entry will be submitted.  
An autopsy, including explant of the study device, may be requested for patients who die with a study 
device in place.  Both the excised aorta and the study device should be sent to the Data Coordinating Center for subsequent examination.  Any study device excised in the course of conversion to open surgical repair should also be sent to the Data Coordinating Center.  Further instructions will be provided as needed.  Data will be collected and stored in a database.  
 
7.10 Imaging 
An imaging manual will be provided by the sponsor.  The imaging criteria specified in the manual shall be followed for all imaging required per the CIP. 
 
7.11 Participation Endpoints of the Study 
A patient’s follow -up in the study will end after any of the following: 
1. Failure to deploy the device +30 days; 
2. Conversion to open surgical repair +30 days; 
3. Patient withdrawal or lost to follow -up; 
4. Patient death;  
5. Closure of the investigation; or 
6. Completion of all scheduled clinical and imaging visits through 5 years.

 8.0  Statistical Considerations  
 
8.1 Hypothesis to be Tested  
The primary hypothesis will assess the treatment success rate evaluated at 12 months for the Zenith® p-
Branch™.   
 
 
  
  
 a
  performance goal of 80% has been established.  The performance goal 
will be said to have been met provided that the null hypothesis i s rejected in favor of the alternative with 
a one- sided exact binomial test at the 0.05 level.  The null (H 0) and alternative (H A) hypotheses are 
expressed as follows, where π is the proportion of patients treated with the Zenith® p-Branch™ with 
treatment success at 12  months: 
Null Hypothesis:  The 12- month treatment success rate for patients treated with the Zenith® p-Branch™ 
does not meet the performance goal (80%).  
   H 0: π ≤ 80% 
 
Alternative Hypothesis: The 12- month treatment success rate for patients t reated with the Zenith® p-
Branch™ meets the performance goal ( 80%).  
   H A: π > 80% 
The safety and effectiveness of the Zenith® p-Branch™ will be established if the null hypothesis is 
rejected in favor of the alternative at a type I error rate of 0.05 (one-sided).  This analysis will be 
performed on the intent- to-treat population. 
 
8.2 Statistical Analysis  
Statistical analyses wil l be performed using SAS® for Windows® (release 9.3 or higher) or other widely 
accepted statistical software.  Descriptive summaries will be provided where appropriate for each of the 
primary and secondary endpoints.  In general, summaries will be complete d over the total population.  
Continuous variable summaries will include the number of subjects (N), mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variable summaries will include the frequency and percentage of subjects who are in the partic ular category.  Survival analysis techniques such as Kaplan -Meier or Cox 

Cook Research Incorporated

CIP 14 -09-03 
 Proportional Hazards will be incorporated if censoring of data occurs.  
 
8.3 Sample Size Calculation  
 
 
  
 
 
 With a clinically relevant margin of 10%,  
 
Thirty -four (34)  patients are necessary to assess the primary hypothesis, under an 
expected 12-month treatment success rate of 97.4%  
 , with a one-sided exact binomial 
test, at a Type I error rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.  A sample size of 80 patients will be enrolled to 
account for possible loss to follow -up while also ensuring sufficient use of both p-Branch graft 
configurations.  
No more than 20 patients (i.e., 25% of total enrollment ) will be enrolled at any one site  
 
  
  
 
8.4 Mi
ssing Data 
Missing data will be addressed using three primary strategies: 1) estimating missing data with the best 
available data, 2) case deletion, and 3) multiple imputation. The first strategy may be used for missing imaging data. Previous clinical study experience suggests that some portion of the imaging data may not meet the criteria for accurate review by the co re laboratory; however, it is recognized that the 
investigator uses this information to provide the best possible care for the patient. Therefore, it is reasonable to substitute any missing core laboratory measurements with the corresponding measurements m ade by the investigator or institutional staff. In addition, the absence or presence of 
clinical sequelae may supplement the required missing core laboratory assessment of device 
performance. This strategy is a best approximation of the missing data value.  The second strategy is case deletion. If the amount of missing data does not result in a reduction of analyzable patients to a number that is below that which is required for sufficient statistical power of the 

Cook Research Incorporated  
Zenith® p-Branch™ Pivotal Study   Page 30 of 47  
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 14 -09-03 
 primary endpoints, then case deletion will be the method of choice for that analysis.  
 
The third method is multiple imputation.   This method will be used to predict missing endpoint or 
covariate data for any reason, including patient lost to follow-up.  It may be that the primary study endpoints depend upon certain covariates; therefore, it may be possible to model study endpoints, given a series of related covariates.   This model-based imputation exercise may provide approximations of the 
missing data that can be utilized in estimating event rates and confidence bounds.  
8.5 Site-level Poolability  
Poolability of data from multiple sites will be verified by examining the primary endpoint among sites.  
Site-level poolability will be considered appropriate provided that this measure is similar among si tes.  It 
is expected that some sites may have too few patients to provide reasonable site- level estimates of the 
primary endpoint.  Pooling of this information will be explored based on hospital size (annual discharge and number of beds), type of hospital (community versus teaching), and other group- wise strategies.  
Should one or more sites differ from the rest, then subsequent analyses will include the discriminating covariate or a covariate to distinguish between the unusual site(s) and those sites that are considered poolable.  
8.6 Limitations of the Study  
This study is designed as a single-arm study without a concurrent control group.  The hypothesis of the 
study involves meeting a performance goal derived from previous clinical stud y results and literature.  In 
the unlikely event that major changes in medical practice have occurred since those studies were performed, the determination o f whether or not the device met the performance goal may be questioned.   
 
Study results may be generalizable only to the types of patients enrolled in the study, which is expected 
to represent the Medicare patient population based on age.  For a previous study, with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, the mean was 75 years (IDE # G040063).

9.0 Deviations from Clinical Investigation Plan  
Investigators are not allowed to deviate from this clinical investigation plan (CIP) without prior authorization by the Sponsor except under emergency situations when necessary to preserve the rights, safety, and well -being of human subjects.   
 
Cook Research Incorporated  
Zenith® p-Branch™ Pivotal Study   Page 31 of 47  
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 14 -09-03 
 Deviations and non-compliances will be recorded together with an explanation.  Deviations or non-
compliances that impact th e rights, welfare, or safety of patients shall be reported to the Sponsor and 
IRB as soon as possible.   
 If appropriate, corrective and preventive actions will be discussed by the sponsor, investigator, and/or the IRB  to determine a suitable course of act ion.  
 
10.0 Data Collection and Reporting  
 
10.1 Electronic Case Report Forms  
Patient data will be collected and entered by  trained personnel at  the investigative site into an electronic 
Case Report Forms (eCRFs) through an electronic data capturing (EDC) system..  This is a secure, web -
based system that allows those with permission to access data from any location at any time.  Source 
data are  to be retained for data entered in to the EDC system.  Data obtained and simultaneously entered 
into the EDC system may also serve as source documentation  (e.g. telephone follow-up).  Site personnel 
are required to have unique login names and passwords in order to enter patient data.  In ac cordance 
with 21 CFR Part 11, the EDC system creates a secure, computer -generated, time- stamped audit trail to 
record the date and time of operator entries and actions that create, modify, or delete electronic records.   
 
10.2 Data Reporting 
Annual progress reports and a final report at the conclusion of the clinical investigation  (or if the study is 
terminated early) will be submitted by the investigators and the Sponsor to the regulatory bodies and 
IRBs as required by local regulations.  
This clinical stud y shall be registered with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of 
Medicine’s (NLM) ClinicalTrials.gov website.  Registration and reporting of results shall be submitted 
in accordance with Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act.  
 
11.0 Data Management and Quality Assurance 
 
11.1 Data Entry and Quality Assurance 
Each principal investigator or appropriately trained designee shall enter the clinical data into the EDC  on 
standardized  eCRFs.  Investigators will provide all applicable clinical data and documentation to the 
Cook Research Incorporated  
Zenith® p-Branch™ Pivotal Study   Page 32 of 47  
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 14 -09-03 
 sponsor. Patient data and documents pertaining to the study will be kept and archived by the sponsor.  
Data will be reviewed for missing data, data consistency, and reasonableness of responses.   
Discrep ancies will be resolved through a formal query process involving direct contact with 
investigators or research coordinators.  The data coordinating center is responsible for database 
management, data verification, data archiving and data retention. 
Pertine nt imaging (pre-procedure, procedure, and follow- up) will be sent to MED Institute, which will 
coordinate shipment of imaging for independent analysis. 
 
11.2 Data Monitoring Arrangements  
The conduct of the clinical study will be supervised through a proces s of centraliz ed and on- site 
monitoring. The Data Coordinating C enter will remotely monitor the study for data completeness and 
for adverse events. On- site monitoring will be implemented as necessary throughout the course of the 
study. The investigator/institution will provide direct access to source data/documents for study- related 
monitoring, audits, IRB review and regulatory inspection. Written procedures for monitoring the 
investigation are maintained by the monitors and can be found in Appendix B. 
 12.0 Safety Monitoring and Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events 
 12.1 Safety Monitoring  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of independent physicians and a least one 
independent statistician , who are not investigators in the investigation, and who do not have a perceived 
conflict of interest with the conduct and administration of the investigation, will be convened on a regular basis to evaluate investigation progress and review adverse events.  
An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) consisting of physicians, who are not investigators in 
the investigation, and who do not have a perceived conflict of interest with the conduct and 
administration of the investigation, will be established to adjudicate clinical events reported during the investigation.  This adjudication will be performed to assess whether the events were due to a pre-existing or unrelated condition, or were procedure- related, technique -related, and/or device- related.  
Regularly scheduled review/monitoring of all patient data will be conducted at the Data Coordinating Center, in part, for identification of adverse events and assurance that they are correctly reported to the DSMB and CEC.

 12.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse events  are to be reported to the Data Coordinating Center using the appropriate e CRF.   In cases 
of adverse device effects or serious adverse events, completed forms should be submitted to the Data 
Coordinating Center as soon as possible upon knowledge of the event. 
The Data Coordinating Center will review the information submitted for possible reporting to the 
Sponsor.  The Sponsor shall, if required according to applicable regulations, report the event to the appropriate Regulatory Authority.  The Principal Investigator or designee will notify their IRB of 
applicable events according to institutional guidelines.  If indicated, all investigators  and sites will be 
notified of applicable by the Sponsor. 
 
13.0 Early Termination or Suspension of the Investigation

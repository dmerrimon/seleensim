Title:  A Randomized Placebo -Controlled Trial Evaluating Radiofrequency and Hybrid Fractional 
Laser for Vaginal Rejuvenation 
 
 
1. Introduction and Purpose:  
Recently there has been an explosion of new minimally invasive technologies for the 
management of postmenopausal vulvovaginal symptoms, vaginal wall laxity, sexual 
dysfunction, and even mild to moderate urinary incontinence with very limited scientific studies 
to back the merits of these technologies and their claims.  
Goals:  
1. To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency (RF) and hybrid fractional laser (HFL) treatment for 
vaginal rejuvenation 
2. To establish objective methods to monitor vaginal rejuvenation following treatments by 
optimizing biopsy sample size and histological/gene expression methods.   
Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that it is possible that vaginal rejuvenation via RF or HFL treatment could be a 
placebo effect. There are claims of improvement in urinary incontinence, appearance, and an 
array of vulvovaginal symptoms. To date, there is a paucity of objec tive data to support these 

STU012017 -006, Kenkel, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_14, 04 -21-20 (1)    claims. We are unaware of any long -term studies following the outcomes after treatment.  
Scientific gap:  
The purpose of our pilot study is to use subjective and objective tests to address some of these 
unanswered questions. 
By collecting data at these short -term and long -term time points we will fill an important 
scientific gap regarding whether these treatments have an actual effect or not.  
2. Background:  
Vaginal rejuvenation is a catch -all term of trendy procedures which claim to provide relief of 
many issues affecting women’s health, ranging from postmenopausal vulvovaginal symptoms 
(i.e. dryness, burning, itching), stress urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction or disc omfort, 
vaginal laxity, and labial appearance, amongst others .3,4

8. Sources of Research Material:  
Medical history and demographic data (age, ethnicity, BMI, gravidity parity (both current and 
past) , menopausal status, hysterectomy/ovarian status, allergies,  current medications, major 
illnesses/hospitalizations, previous surgeries, smoking status, systemic hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT), current sexual activity, and medical co -morbidities ).  Subjective assessments 
including Vulvovaginal Symptom Questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Index, Vaginal Laxity 
Questionnaire, Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form, and Incontinence Impact 
Questionnaire Short Form.  Objective assessments including Zimmern Probe measurement and 
vulvovaginal biopsy studies for histo logy and gene expression studies.  
 
9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:  
 
At the time of their recruitment, subjects will be notified of the risks and benefits of the study 
and will be provided with the consent form for their consideration. Informed consent and 
HIPAA Authorization will be done in the presence of the principal investigator, co -investigators 
or designated clinical trial coordinator unde r the University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center at Dallas guidelines. A copy of the signed consent and HIPAA Authorization will be given 
to the subject,  and the original will be kept in the source documents. All subjects will be 

STU012017 -006, Kenkel, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_14, 04 -21-20 (1)    repeatedly asked if they have any questions regarding the study procedures.  
10. Potential Risks:  
The risks of radiofrequency, high frequency laser treatment , and dual therapy administering 
both radiofrequency and a high frequency laser of the vulvovaginal region include discomfort, 
mild edema, temporary erythema, spot bleeding, potential for transient over -active bladder, 
injury to bowel and bladder, and painful intercourse due to over -treatment. Less commonly, 
scarring, burns, and infection could occur. Should infection occur, treatment with antibiotics 
and even surgical intervention (i.e. I&D) may be required.  
The risks of vaginal wall punch biopsy include pain, bleeding, bruising, infection, and possible 
scarring.  
The RF or HFL treatment procedure will be performed by a medical provider  who has been 
trained by  in the application of the device. The punch biopsy and 
probe application will be performed by this same doctor. There is no known risks associated 
with the suction probe to measure the anterior biomechanical vaginal wall tissue properties in 
situ.  
There is also a potential risk of Loss of Confidentially  during data colle ction.  However, this risk 
can be minimized by de -identification of the patient data, and access limited to members of the 
research team.  
 
11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring  
All study records will be identified by a study identification number. 

STU012017 -006, Kenkel, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_14, 04 -21-20 (1)     
12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  
All study records and information will be identified by the subject number. All subject 
identifiers will be removed from all documents. The link between  subject name and study ID 
number will be kept in separate password -protected files. 
All electronic study 
data will be password protected with access limited to members of the research team. 
Electronic data will be password protected.   
 
 
14. Biostatistics:  
The primary outcome of this study is the VSQ. We have estimated the standard deviation to be 
2.5 based on prediction of pre -treatment scores ranging from 4 to 14. To detect a difference of 
3 po ints on this measure with 80% power, 20 subjects per group will be required.  
One way analysis of variance will be used for comparison of groups both for the VSQ and the Q -
PCR data. Questionnaire results will be compared by comparing the results at each time point 
compared to pretreatment assessment.  
UT Southwestern affiliated clinical statisticians have been and will continue to be consulted 
throughout the statistical analysis process.

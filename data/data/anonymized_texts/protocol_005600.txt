Amendment 2.01 16 March 2018
Administrative Change 1 29 June 2018
The purpose of this amendment is to:
●Update the proposed dosing for subjects who will enroll in Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 
throughout protocol.
Rationale:   Proposed dosing for subjects in Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 have been 
updated, including in the Dose Selection Strategy in the Introduction, 
Section 3.0, sub-section titled "GLE/PIB Dose Selection Strategy for the 
Pediatric Population."  These are the doses based on the current knowledge of the PK and safety of the pediatric doses of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir.
●Update Section 3.3.
Rationale:   Additional details regarding the pediatric requirement were added 
for completeness.
●Update Section 5.5.2, Identity of Investigational Products, with the dose and 
storage requirements for the GLE/PIB granules, including the addition of a footnote. 
Rationale:  Add the final GLE and PIB doses in mg as packaged into sachets, 
and provide details on the use of the nomenclature "pellets" and "granules" for 
GLE and PIB. The nomenclature is interchangeable, as both terms refer to the same pediatric formulation, however, "granules" has been added as this is the 
preferred regulatory term in certain regions. 
●Update Section 6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3

Name of Active Ingredient:
Glecaprevir (GLE)/Pibrentasvir (PIB)Date of Protocol Synopsis:   22 March 2019
Protocol Title:  An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and 
Efficacy of Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir in Pediatric Subjects with Genotypes 1 – 6 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (DORA)
Objective:  Assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of GLE/PIB in pediatric subjects.
Investigator:   Multicenter
Study Site:   Approximately 40 sites globally
Study Population:   HCV genotype 1 – 6-infected pediatric subjects ≥ 3 to < 18 years of age, who are 
either treatment-naïve, treatment-experienced to interferon (IFN – alpha, beta or pegylated interferon [pegIFN]) with or without ribavirin (RBV) or treatment-experienced to sofosbuvir with IFN and/or RBV.  Subjects may be non-cirrhotic or have compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis.  Subjects with 
HCV/HIV-1 co-infection are eligible for study inclusion.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 125 subjects
Methodology:   
The study will enroll approximately 125 HCV-infected pediatric subjects, divided into four (4) age 
groups, 3 to < 6, 6 to < 9, 9 to < 12, and 12 to < 18 years of age.  Enrollment will begin in Part 1 of the study, into the age group 12 to < 18 years old who are willing to swallow the adult formulation of GLE/PIB.  Part 2 of the study will enroll the remaining age groups; those will receive the pediatric formulation of GLE/PIB. 
Within each age group, approximately 12 HCV-infected pediatric subjects will be enrolled for intensive 
pharmacokinetics (IPK) in order to adequately characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a particular age group for dose confirmation, and the remainder of subjects will be enrolled for the evaluation of safety and efficacy of each age group until the total pediatric study population reaches approximately 125 subjects.  Additional PK assessments will be obtained for subjects enrolled in Japan for the purpose of further characterization within Japanese subjects; this is not included within the aforementioned 12 subjects.
Intensive PK sampling is designed to allow for dose adjustment, based on available pharmacokinetic and 
clinical data to achieve therapeutic exposures that have been safe and efficacious in adult subjects.  Area under the concentration curve (AUC) will be the primary measure for dose adjustment.  The duration(s) of treatment will be 8, 12, or 16 weeks of therapy dependent on patient genotype, cirrhosis status, and prior HCV treatment history.
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be followed for 144 weeks after completing 
or prematurely discontinuing the study treatment to assess long-term safety and durability of SVR
12.

Criteria for Evaluation:
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of GLE and PIB will be determined at each study visit for each subject during the 
treatment period.  A single blood sample will be collected without regard to the time of dosing.  For those participating in the intensive pharmacokinetic sampling, samples will be collected at the Week 2 visit immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours post dose.  The pre-dose blood sample (0 hour) will be used for steady state assessment of GLE and PIB.  For subjects enrolled in Japan, additional pharmacokinetic sampling will be collected at the Week 2 visit; samples will either be collected immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours post dose, or immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at 2 and 4 hours post dose.
Efficacy:
Plasma HCV RNA (IU/mL) will be assessed at each  treatment and Post-Treatment Period visit.
Safety:Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, physical examinations, clinical 
laboratory tests, and vital signs.  Palatability/acceptability, for the pediatric formulation only, will also be assessed.
Resistance:
The polymorphisms at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions at baseline will be tabulated 
and summarized for all subjects receiving study drugs in Part 1.  For subjects in Part 2 of the study, baseline polymorphisms will be determined based on availability of samples.  For all subjects who experience virologic failure and have an HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL, post-baseline substitutions relative 
to the baseline sequence and to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be tabulated and summarized.
Statistical Methods:
Pharmacokinetic:
The primary endpoint will be steady state AUC of GLE and PIB estimated by non-compartmental 
pharmacokinetic analysis or population pharmacokinetic analysis, including AUC at Week 2 in subjects with intensive pharmacokinetics samples and AUC in all subjects with or without intensive PK samples.  The main secondary endpoint is C
maxand clearance of GLE and PIB.  Non-compartmental 
pharmacokinetic analysis or population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using intensive or overall pharmacokinetic data to facilitate potential GLE and PIB dose modification in each age group.  The distribution of AUC values for GLE and PIB in each age group corresponding to the final proposed doses will be estimated.  The 95% confidence interval for the geometric mean of AUC values will be calculated.  Other parameters including C
max, Ctrough and clearance will be estimated and summarized for 
each age group, and summarized separately for subjects recruited in Japan.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy:The secondary endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR
12overall and by age group.  The 
percentage will be calculated along with a 2-sided 95% confidence interval calculated using the normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution, unless the number of subjects who fail to achieve SVR 12is 
less than 5, where the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence interval instead.
Additional secondary endpoints include the percentage of subjects who experience post-treatment 
relapse, the percentage of subjects who experience on-treatment virologic failure (i.e., breakthrough or 
failure to suppress at the end of treatment), and the percentage of subjects with new HCV infection (i.e., re-infection) at any time up to the last study visit.
Safety:
The number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term overall 
and by age group.  Laboratory samples will be collected at Baseline, at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 (if applicable depending on treatment duration) and at Post-Treatment Weeks 4 through 144.  Laboratory 
values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be identified, and the percentage of subjects with potentially clinically significant values during the Treatment Period will be summarized overall and by age group.  Palatability/acceptability will be assessed for the pediatric formulation only.  Additional summary statistics for safety data will be performed if deemed appropriate.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs in Part 1, and subjects with available samples in Part 2 of the 
study, the polymorphisms at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions at baseline identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for all subjects receiving study drug who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
substitutions in available post-baseline samples identified by NGS and comparison to the baseline 
sequences, 2) the amino acid substitutions in available post baseline samples at signature resistance-
associated positions identified by NGS, and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral resistance by NGS.

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 184 million 
individuals infected worldwide.1  There are 7 identified HCV genotypes, with genotype 1 
(GT1) being the most prevalent worldwide.  HCV genotypes 2 (GT2) and 3 (GT3) infections are more common in Latin America (5% to 30%), Europe (20% to 40%) and Asia (30% to 45%).
2-4  HCV GT4 is commonly found in parts of Africa and the Middle 
East, particularly in Egypt, GT5 is primarily found in South Africa, and GT6 is primarily found in south-east Asia, and GT7 has recently been described in Central Africa.

Prevalence data, specific to the pediatric population, is also found in NHANES ( Table 1).  
Prevalence estimates based on diagnosed pediatric cases of HCV infection are a small fraction compared to the overall anti-HCV antibody prevalence in this population, suggesting many children are not diagnosed during childhood.  The most robust estimates from NHANES come from NHANES III, which covered the years 1988 to 1994 where 2,762 and 2,905 children ages 6 to 11 and 12 to 19 years, respectively, were screened.  The prevalence of anti-HCV antibody was 0.2% for children 6 to 11 years and 0.4% for children 12 to 19 years during this timeframe (genotype [GT] was not specified).
6  
Estimates from the 1999 through 2002 NHANES survey also indicate a prevalence of HCV antibody in 6- to 11-year-olds of 0.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04%, 0.6%) and 0.4% (95% CI 0.2%, 0.9%) in 7- to 19-year-olds (GT not specified).
7  Similar low 
anti-HCV antibody prevalence rates of 0.1% were found in a cross-sectional, serologic survey of 1,034 urban children aged 1 to 11 years conducted in the years 2000 through 2002 (GT not specified).
8  In addition, a retrospective evaluation of dried heel stick blood 
spots from 2,806 live births in southern California in 2003 found an anti HCV antibody prevalence of 0.25% (GT not specified).

According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the incidence of acute HCV 
infection (confirmed and reported) in the general population in the US was highest (2.4 cases per 100,000 population) in 1992;
10generally declined until 2003, remained 
relatively stable until 2010, and increased 75% from 2010 to 2012, with the largest increases occurring in the population aged 0 to 19 years.
10,11  In the population aged 0 to 
19 years in the US, the incidence of acute HCV infection (confirmed and reported) decreased from 0.11 to 0.05 cases per 100,000 population from 2000 to 2010

increased from 0.05 to 0.11 cases per 100,000 population from 2010 to 2012.11

The primary differences in HCV infection between adults and pediatrics are differences in 
the mode of infection (e.g., perinatal transmission in children and increased intravenous drug abuse in adults) and natural history of disease.  Studies comparing the natural history of HCV infection in both adults and children have been limited by small sample sizes, with an average sample size of 22 patients.
12  Despite this, progression to advanced liver 
disease appears to be less common in children than in adults, occurring in about 2% of pediatric patients.
13  Duration of infection appears to be an important factor accounting for 
this difference.14  However, when histology was compared between 21 children and 
52 adults, the children had significantly milder histologic disease and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations even after controlling for duration of disease and other potentially confounding variables.
15  Differences in rates of severe disease and cirrhosis 
between adults and children may also be related to differences in exposure to alcohol, drugs, and superinfections more commonly found in adults.
16  Extra hepatic 
manifestations of HCV are rare in children, which may also reflect slower disease progression in children.
17
During the last 10 years, vertical transmission has become the primary mode of transmission in children, and transmission via transfusion or health care is exceedingly rare in developed countries.
18  Therefore, appropriate serologic and virologic screening of 
infants born to HCV-infected mothers is a cornerstone of early diagnosis.  In infants, the presence of anti-HCV antibody may be due to passive transplacental passage from the 
mother.  Thus antibody testing for perinatal infection is unreliable until approximately 12 to 18 months of age.  In patients with detectable antibody, diagnosis of chronic HCV infection is generally made by the persistence of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) for at least 6 months.  In perinatal transmission, loss of HCV RNA could reflect transient viremia or a resolved infection.  The chronicity rate in perinatal transmission is high; spontaneous clearance generally occurs by the third year of life, and clearance beyond age 4 is unlikely.
According to the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, 
and Nutrition (NASPGHAN), all children aged 3 to 17 years who are chronically infected

with HCV may be considered candidates for treatment, and should be considered for 
treatment if they develop consistently elevated serum aminotransferase levels or liver fibrosis.
19  The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 
recommends that DAA regimens should be recommended independent of disease severity, if a regimen is available dependent upon the child's age group.
30  The combinations of 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, and sofosbuvir + ribavirin have been approved for use in adolescents, though neither combination covers all major genotypes alone.
28,29  To date, 
there are no treatment regimens approved for use in HCV-infected patients aged < 3 years.  There are several studies of interferon-free regimens in children including sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for GT1 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), sofosbuvir (SOF) plus RBV for GT2 and 3 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir for GT1 and GT4 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Results with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy are promising, showing high SVR
12rates in adolescents, similar to adults.  In one clinical 
trial, 100 adolescents with GT1 infection treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir achieved an SVR
12rate of 97%.21  A high SVR 12rate of 98% has also been in seen adolescents with 
GT2 and GT3 infection after treatment with SOF + RBV.22
AbbVie has developed two "next generation" DAAs Glecaprevir (GLE, formerly known as ABT-493), an HCV NS3/4A PI, and pibrentasvir (PIB, formerly known as ABT-530), an NS5A inhibitor, for use in combination for the treatment of HCV.  GLE and PIB each have potent in vitro antiviral activity against genotypes 1 through 6,
23and a high genetic 
barrier to resistance, with no or little loss of potency against common resistant-associated substitutions.  Additive or synergistic in vitro anti-HCV activity has been demonstrated 
with the combination of GLE and PIB.  GLE 100 mg and PIB 40 mg are co-formulated into a fixed-dose combination tablet (hereafter referred to as GLE/PIB), which provides adult patients with a convenient once-daily (QD), fixed-dose combination treatment regimen (three tablets QD) to maximize treatment compliance.  A pediatric formulation comprised of film-coated pellets/granules of GLE and PIB, respectively, in a single 
container for a convenient QD oral administration with a dosing vehicle has been developed.

Overview of GLE/PIB Registrational Phase 3 Program and Supportive Phase 2 
Studies
The GLE/PIB registrational program included a broad subject population including 
subjects with compensated liver disease and subjects with severe renal insufficiency across all genotypes using a single GLE/PIB dose of 300 mg/120 mg QD.  Supportive Phase 2 studies used the Phase 2 formulation of separate GLE and PIB tablets, with each tablet containing 100 mg and 40 mg, respectively.  Treatment arms from these supportive Phase 2 studies using the regimen selected for registrational studies (GLE 300 mg plus PIB 120 mg) were pooled with arms from the registrational studies for analyses of efficacy and safety.  Treatment-naïve (TN) and treatment-experience (TE) subjects to any 
combination of pegylated IFN (pegIFN), RBV, SOF, NS5A inhibitors, or PIs were allowed in the program.  In addition, the program included subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection (Study M13-590), subjects with chronic kidney disease [CKD] Stages 4 – 5, including those on hemodialysis (Study M15-462), subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Studies M14-172, M15-462, and M14-868 Part 3), and subjects with or without cirrhosis who failed a previous regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor and/or an NS3/4A PI (Study M15-410).
A total of 2,376 subjects were randomized or enrolled in the registrational studies or 
supportive Phase 2 studies to receive GLE 300 mg QD and PIB 120 mg QD.  Of these, 2,369 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug ( Table 2 ).

Impact of Baseline Polymorphisms on Treatment Outcome
The association between baseline polymorphisms and treatment outcome in subjects who 
receive GLE 300 mg QD with PIB 120 mg QD in the registrational or supportive Phase 2 studies was evaluated by conducting an integrated analysis of baseline sequence data.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted on all baseline samples at 15% detection threshold at key amino acid positions 155, 156, and 168 in NS3, and 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, and 93 in NS5A. 
In subjects who were TN or TE-PRS, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 were detected in 
1.1% (9/845), 0.8% (3/398), 1.6% (10/613), 1.2% (2/164), 41.9% (13/31), and 2.9% (1/34) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6-infection, respectively.  Baseline polymorphisms in NS5A were detected in 26.8% (225/841), 79.8% (331/415), 22.1% (136/615), 49.7% (80/161), 12.9% (4/31), and 54.1% (20/37) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6-infection, respectively.
The presence of baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A did not have an impact on 
SVR
12rates for GT1, 2, 4, 5, or 6-infected subjects.
Within GT3-infected subjects, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and the NS5A polymorphisms at positions 24, 28, 31, 58, 92, or 93 did not have an impact on treatment outcome.

Amino Acid Substitutions in Subjects Experiencing Virologic Failure
Among TN and TE-PRS subjects with or without cirrhosis treated for 8, 12, or 16 weeks, 
23 subjects experienced virologic failure (2 with GT1, 2 with GT2, and 19 with GT3).  A GT3 infected subject experiencing virologic failure was determined to have been re-infected with GT3a virus distinct from the one present at baseline.  Therefore, baseline polymorphisms and treatment-emergent substitutions were analyzed for 22 subjects experiencing virologic failure. 
Among the 2 GT1-infected subjects, 1 had treatment-emergent substitutions A156V in 
NS3 and Q30R/L31M/H58D in NS5A, and 1 had treatment-emergent Q30R/H58D (while Y93N was present at baseline and post-treatment) in NS5A.
Among the 2 GT2-infected subjects, no treatment-emergent substitutions were observed 
in NS3 or NS5A; the prevalent M31 polymorphism in NS5A was present at baseline and post-treatment in both subjects.
Among the 18 GT3-infected subjects, the majority of subjects had treatment-emergent 
variants at the time of failure in NS3 (61.1%, 11/18) and NS5A (88.9%, 16/18).  Treatment emergent NS3 substitutions Y56H/N, Q80K/R, A156G, and Q168L/R were observed in 11 subjects, and A166S or Q168R was present at both baseline and post-treatment in 5 subjects.  Treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28G, A30G/K, L31F, P58T, or Y93H were observed in 16 subjects, and 13 subjects had A30K (n = 9) or Y93H (n = 5) at both baseline and post-treatment.
Integrated Safety Results
A summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) from pooled analyses of the 
registrational studies and supportive Phase 2 studies along with the AEs occurring with a  frequency > 5% are headache, fatigue, nausea and diarrhea (Table 4 ).  The majority of 
subjects experienced an AE, which were mostly considered to be mild in severity by the investigator (Grade 1).  Rates of AEs that were serious, led to premature study drug discontinuation or had a severity Grade ≥ 3 were low.  Including data from

The frequency and severity of hepatic-related AEs as well as liver chemistry 
abnormalities evaluating potential hepatotoxicity were low across the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Liver-related safety results indicated that:
●Four subjects had post-nadir Grade 3 ALT abnormalities or Grade 2 ALT with 
total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN.  None of these subjects prematurely discontinued 
study drug due to an ALT or bilirubin increase.
○ALT abnormalities in 3 of these 4 subjects were not clinically significant.
○One subject experienced concurrent ALT > 3 × ULN (increase from nadir 
grade) and total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN in the context of multiple gallstones 
and was not consistent with drug-induced liver injury.
●Based on exposure-response analyses, no exposure-dependent ALT increases were observed in subjects with ALT abnormalities.
●Grade 3 increases in bilirubin were infrequent (0.4%) and without bilirubin-
related AEs; none were associated with liver disease progression.
●No subjects experienced drug-related hepatic decompensation.  One subject 
with cirrhosis (Study M14-172) who had known esophageal varices 
experienced an episode of esophageal varices hemorrhage that was considered 
not related to study drug.  Treatment was continued without clinical or laboratory signs of liver disease progression.
●A total of 6 (0.3%) subjects experienced a de novo event of HCC.  In all 
6 subjects, the events were considered related to subject's medical history of underlying liver disease and not to GLE/PIB.
In summary, GLE/PIB demonstrated a favorable safety profile similar across durations of 
8, 12, and 16 weeks.  The regimen was well tolerated across a broad and diverse population of subjects, including subjects with cirrhosis, HIV co-infection, and CKD Stage 4 or 5. 
Common study drug-related AEs occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects were headache, fatigue 
and nausea.  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were mostly Grade 1 (mild) in severity.  
Serious AEs and AEs leading to premature study drug discontinuation were rare.

There were no hematological or blood chemistry findings of concern or considered likely 
related to treatment.  Unlike other protease inhibitors, no liver-related toxicities and no cases consistent with drug-induced liver injury were identified.  
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB used 
together for the treatment of those with chronic HCV GT1 to 6-infection in the pediatric population.
Overview of GLE/PIB Phase 3 Clinical Studies in Japan
Two Phase 3 Studies (Studies M15-594 and M15-828) conducted in Japan enrolled 
332 adults with chronic HCV GT1 – GT3 infection who were treated with GLE/PIB 300/120 mg QD for 8 or 12 weeks.  These studies included treatment-naïve, both IFN based-experienced and DAA-experienced subjects, subjects without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis, and with or without severe renal impairment.  A high overall SVR
12rate of 98.3% was observed across DAA-naïve subjects treated with GLE/PIB at 
the recommended durations regardless of HCV genotype or comorbidities (cirrhosis or renal impairment).  In addition, a high SVR
12rate of 93.9% was observed in subjects with 
previous DAA-experience who were treated with GLE/PIB for 12 weeks.
The most common AEs ( ≥ 5% of subjects) across the two Japan Phase 3 studies were 
nasopharyngitis, pruritis, and headache.  The majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity.  Serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were rare.  No TEAE deemed related to GLE/PIB occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects across the 
two Japan Phase 3 studies.  There were no hematological or blood chemistry findings of concern.  No cases of DILI or hepatic decompensation were identified.  Overall, the type, frequency and severity of AEs in subjects with compensated cirrhosis were similar to subjects without cirrhosis.  In addition, no unique safety signal or toxicity was identified from the use of GLE/PIB in subjects with severe renal insufficiency including those on dialysis.

GLE/PIB Dose Selection Strategy for the Pediatric Population
AbbVie's pediatric formulation development strategy is to develop a dosage form that 
provides suitable and flexible dosing across the pediatric age range of 3 to < 18 years.  Development of a suitable pediatric formulation was guided by considerations of solubility, dose flexibility, stability, compatibility, and ease and reliability of the manufacturing process.  It is likely the adult tablets will be suitable for adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with weights ≥ 45 kg.  This population is able to swallow tablets 
and utilizing the adult tablet would enable earlier enrollment of this population. In Part 1 of Study M16-123, a total of 47 adolescent subjects received daily administration of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg. PK results showed that the exposures of GLE and PIB in HCV-infected adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age) were similar to the exposures observed in HCV-infected adult subjects following administration of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg.
GLE and PIB exhibit low aqueous solubility.  Due to probable requirement of solvent(s) 
that are undesirable for pediatric patients for any oral solution, and  
 AbbVie developed a pediatric 
formulation based on the solid oral formulations used to manufacture the adult tablets.  
To provide exposures in pediatric subjects comparable to adult exposures using the pediatric formulation, the GLE and PIB dose in pediatric patients of 3 to < 12 years of agewere revised from originally proposed doses.  Preliminary PK results from the initial 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
31
proposed pediatric doses demonstrated that though GLE and PIB exposures were within 
the range of exposure for efficacy and safety in adults for each of the pediatric cohorts, the average exposures in each of the cohorts were lower than the targeted AUC and led to a dose adjustment. Additional subjects were enrolled and the intensive PK results obtained, and additional population PK modeling performed, confirming that the adjusted doses demonstrate exposures that would allow for bridging of adult data, using a 50/20 mg dose ratio.  These doses ( Table 11 ) are proposed to be used in the subjects enrolling in the non-
IPK portion of Part 2, in order to confirm that the doses would provide similar exposures observed in HCV-infected adult subjects, close to the targeted AUC.
3.1 Differences Statement
This is the first study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB in 
HCV-infected pediatric subjects (under 18 years old).  The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the adult formulation of GLE/PIB will be evaluated in Part 1 in 12 to < 18 years of age who can swallow the adult formulation.  Part 2 will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the pediatric formulation in 3 to < 12 years of age.  The study populations for Part 1 and Part 2 will include GT1 – 6 infected subjects with or without compensated cirrhosis.  Those subjects undergoing intensive pharmacokinetic (IPK) analysis must be HCV treatment naïve and HIV negative.  Subjects who are treatment experienced (prior IFN, peg-IFN, RBV, SOF) and/or co-infected with HIV-1 may enroll in the safety and efficacy portion of the study.  Long-term safety and efficacy will be evaluated in a 144-week Post-Treatment Period for all subjects enrolled.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Efficacy of GLE/PIB has been demonstrated in adult subjects with chronic HCV infection 
within the GLE/PIB Registrational program.  Since there is no difference in disease symptomatology and only minor differences in the natural progression of disease between adults and children, which are largely age related, the effectiveness of GLE/PIB against chronic HCV infection is expected to be similar between the two populations.  Part 1 of 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
32
this study encompasses those who are between the ages of 12 to < 18 years of age, and 
who are able to swallow the adult co-formulated fixed-dose tablets.  Eligible subjects will receive GLE/PIB for 8, 12, or 16 weeks depending on HCV genotype, cirrhosis status, and prior treatment experience in accordance with each developmental program (Global and Japan) for the use of GLE/PIB in adults.  Part 2 of this study encompasses those who are between the ages of 3 to < 12 years of age who will take the pediatric formulation.  Study drug duration will be for 8, 12, or 16 weeks depending on HCV genotype, cirrhosis status, and prior treatment experience in accordance with each developmental program (Global and Japan) for the use of GLE/PIB in adults.  
In the pediatric population, the risks associated with GLE/PIB, which have been limited 
and manageable to date, are anticipated to be similar to the adult population.  The efficacy of this regimen has not yet been defined in pediatric populations, and it is possible that the treatment failure rate may be higher than what was observed in the Phase 3 trials in adults.  Adverse events that are known, and those not previously described, may occur with the combination of the two DAAs, as detailed in the informed consent for this study.  In addition, subjects may experience inconvenience or discomfort related to the study visits or study procedures.  Additional safety data for each DAA alone and in combination are detailed above and in the Investigator's Brochure.
Given the potential high SVR rate in populations of HCV-infected subjects, the benefit-
risk profile for co-administered GLE/PIB as treatment for chronic HCV infection is favorable.
3.3 Pediatric Study Plan and Pediatric Investigational Plan
This study design was developed in accordance with the agreed initial Pediatric Study 
Plan (iPSP) and Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for GLE/PIB for the treatment of Hepatitis C virus infection (IND Number 127,416, Reference ID:  3959249; EMA reference EMEA-001832-PIP01-15).
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
33
The Pediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a 
positive opinion on the PIP for GLE/PIB on April 29, 2016.  Upon AbbVie request, a waiver was granted for the pediatric population younger than 3 years of age "on the grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant benefit over existing treatment for pediatric patients" in this age group.  
Similarly, on July 15, 2016, the FDA confirmed its agreement with the iPSP for GLE/PIB, 
dated June 16, 2016.  In the agreed iPSP, AbbVie indicated its plans to request a waiver for the pediatric population younger than 3 years of age.  On December 14, 2016, AbbVie submitted its waiver request as part of the original New Drug Application (NDA) 209394 (eCTD Sequence 0000).  On August 03, 2017, FDA waived the pediatric requirement for children younger than 3 years of age because the necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (Reference ID:  4134372).

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
The study is designed to enroll approximately 125 subjects to meet scientific, regulatory and clinical objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.  All subjects must undergo a mandatory Fibrosis Assessment prior to enrollment into Part 1 or Part 2 of the study (refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for more details).
Part 1 of the study allows for enrollment of approximately 44 HCV infected, GT1 – 6 
pediatric subjects into the 12 to < 18 years old age group who weigh ≥ 45 kg and are able 
to swallow (whole tablets – without crushing or breaking) the adult formulation of GLE/PIB.  Part 2 of the study allows for enrollment of approximately 81 HCV infected, GT1 – 6 pediatric subjects divided into the 3 to < 6, 6 to < 9 and 9 to < 12 years old age groups.  Subjects will receive the pediatric formulation of GLE/PIB in Part 2.  
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
35
Each age group in Part 1 and Part 2 will enroll approximately 12 HCV infected subjects to 
adequately characterize the pharmacokinetics of a particular age group.  Those individuals will undergo an intensive PK sample draw at the Week 2 visit with blood samples taken immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours post dose.  After the approximately first six (6) subjects per age cohort complete the intensive PK at the Week 2 visit, the PK samples of those subjects will be analyzed to determine dose adjustments of GLE/PIB in an age cohort, if needed.  After the intensive PK analysis results are available, enrollment will resume with approximately six (6) additional subjects per age cohort and intensive PK of all approximately twelve (12) subjects will be evaluated to determine if the study drug doses have achieved therapeutic exposures which have been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in adult subjects.  Additional subjects may be required for further intensive PK analysis per age cohort if therapeutic exposure targets have not been achieved.  Once doses have been confirmed based on intensive PK data for a respective age group, enrollment into the safety/efficacy portion of that age group may begin.
For each subject enrolled into the intensive PK portion, the initial dose of GLE/PIB will 
be based on the subject's body weight and age at screening ( Table 11 ).  Enrollment will 
first start into the intensive PK portion of Part 1 for the 12 to < 18 years old age group.  Once the pediatric study drug formulation is available, Part 2 enrollment will be opened.  Pediatric subjects will be enrolled first into the intensive PK portion of each of the Part 2 age groups (3 to < 6, 6 to < 9, and 9 to < 12 years) in parallel.
Enrollment for subjects in Japan in Part 1 and Part 2 will start upon dose confirmation of 
the intensive PK portions of the study.  Eligible Japanese subjects will be given the option to participate in Japan specific intensive PK sampling (J-IPK) to maximize data collection and to better characterize GLE and PIB exposures in children in Japan.  Consent to collect blood samples up to 12 hours post dose (0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours) will be requested of all participants from Japan.  However, if patients are not willing to participate in the J-IPK portion of the study then a reduced number of PK samples will be collected at the Week 2

visit immediately prior to dose (0 hour) and at 2 and 4 hours post dose.  At least 2 to 
3 subjects will be enrolled in each of the age cohorts in Part 1 and Part 2 at sites in Japan.
Figure 1. Study Schematic
The intensive PK portions of Part 1 and Part 2 will allow enrollment of pediatric subjects
with or without compensated cirrhosis who are treatment naïve and who meet the weight bands for their age ( Table 11 ).  The HCV genotype must be identified (i.e., Screening 
laboratory result indicating HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6-infection) for those participating in the intensive PK portions of the study.  The safety/efficacy portion of both Part 1 and Part 2 will include pediatric patients with or without compensated cirrhosis that are treatment naïve or treatment experienced (prior IFN [alpha, beta or pegIFN], RBV or SOF exposure), with or without HIV-1 co-infection, or subjects with mixed or indeterminate HCV genotype.  
Pediatric subjects that fall outside of the weight bands for their age ( Table 11 ) may be 
included in the safety and efficacy parts of Part 1 and Part 2 only with approval of the 
AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director after consideration of risks and benefits.  All 

Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
37
subjects will receive GLE/PIB for 8, 12 or 16 weeks, depending on their HCV genotype, 
cirrhosis and prior HCV treatment status.  No dose adjustments of GLE/PIB will be made as a consequence of weight change during the Treatment Period.  For patients with an indeterminate or mixed genotype including GT3, treatment duration will default to the respective GT3 duration based upon treatment-experience and cirrhosis status.  Patients with a mixed GT other than GT3, treatment duration will default to the longer treatment duration based on GT, treatment-experience and cirrhosis status.
Both Parts 1 and 2 will consist of a Screening Period (Section 5.1.1), a Treatment Period 
(Section 5.1.2), and a Post Treatment Period (Section 5.1.3).  Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue during the Treatment Period in Part 1 or Part 2 will be followed-up in the Post-Treatment Period through Week 144.  After completing the Treatment Period in Part 1 or Part 2, the subjects will be followed-up for 144 weeks in the Post-Treatment Period.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Post-Treatment Period will be discontinued from the study.
The pharmacokinetic and clinical data from age groups of 3 to < 6, 6 to < 9, and 9 to 
< 12 years old may be combined for final analyses if exposures from these three (3) age groups are comparable to each other.
In both Parts 1 and 2, for each of the analytes (GLE and PIB), the geometric mean and 
individual AUC values from these pediatric subjects from the Week 2 intensive PK sampling will be compared with the distribution of individual AUCs across Phase 2/3 studies in adults on an ongoing basis.  Dose adjustments may be made for each component of the DAA regimen if the respective geometric mean AUC in pediatric subjects is significantly deviated from the geometric mean AUC values in adults.  
AUC will be the primary measure for dose adjustment.  Other pharmacokinetic exposure 
parameters including C
maxand C trough will be considered to provide similar therapeutic 
exposures that have been safe and efficacious in adult subjects. 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
38
Additional safety and efficacy criteria may be considered for making dose adjustment 
decisions for Parts 1 and 2 to ensure safe and efficacious exposures.  
5.1.1 Screening
Prior to any study specific procedures being performed on the subject at the Screening 
Visit for Part 1 or Part 2, parent(s)/guardian(s) must provide written (signed and dated) informed consent and the subject must provide assent (as appropriate for age and country) respectively.
Subjects will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology 
(IRT) system and will undergo the study procedures identified in Section 5.3.1 associated 
with the Screening Visit.  The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 for the Part in which they are enrolling during 
the period from the Screening Visit through Study Day 1 prior to dosing and record the results of this assessment and the details of the informed consent and assent process in the subject's medical records.
Eligible subjects have up to 42 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into Part 1 or 
Part 2 of the study.
5.1.1.1 Rescreening
Subjects who at Screening have any of the following are not eligible to retest or rescreen:
●A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg);
●Hepatitis B DNA > lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ);
●A positive serum pregnancy test (if female).
Otherwise, subjects may be retested or rescreened only once before requiring approval 
from the Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director to rescreen again.
Retesting:
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
39
Subjects who have exclusionary laboratory parameter(s) per Exclusion Criterion 8 
(Section 5.2.2) are allowed to retest on the related panel(s) (e.g., exclusionary albumin 
requires a repeat chemistry panel) within the same screening period and must meet all other eligibility laboratory criteria on the panel that is repeated.  If the retest result(s) are also exclusionary, the subject may only be rescreened or retested again with approval from the Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
Rescreening:
Subjects that exceed the initial 42-day screening period should be rescreened for all 
laboratory and eligibility criteria, not just those that were exclusionary at the first screening attempt (with the exception of HBsAg, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and positive serum pregnancy test) (Section 5.2.2).
The Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director should be contacted for approval prior to rescreening.  Subjects that are beyond the initial 42-day screening period may still be allowed to enroll within a reasonable time period if they continue to meet all eligibility criteria and have received approval by the Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director.  If rescreened, the 42 day screening period restarts, and subjects retain their initial subject number.
For subjects who rescreen and still do not meet the study eligibility criteria upon 
retest/rescreen, the site personnel must register the subject as a screen failure in both IRT and electronic data capture (EDC) systems.
5.1.2 Treatment Period (TP)
After meeting all the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled to a study regimen 
according to their genotype, cirrhosis and prior HCV treatment status as shown in Table 5.  
for global subjects and Table 6 for subjects in Japan.  The treatment duration for subjects 
in Japan is consistent with the currently proposed label in Japan.  There are some minor differences from the Global regimen, mostly in subpopulations not common in Japan

GLE/PIB will be administered as described in Section 5.5.1 (Treatments Administered).  
Subjects and their parent(s)/guardian(s) will receive instructions about the study drugs at 
the Day 1 Visit.  The study drugs will be dispensed at the visits as indicated in Appendix C .
After the Day 1 visit, all subjects will continue to return to the site on an outpatient basis for the study visits and procedures as identified in Appendix C .  Subjects could also return 
to the site for an unscheduled study visit for additional safety assessments if the investigator or sponsor feels it is necessary.  Sites should ensure that subjects adhere to the study visits listed in Appendix C .  Subjects who cannot complete their study visit per 
the visit schedule should ensure they do not run out of study drug prior to their next study

visit.  Study drug compliance is critical to ensure adequate drug exposure and optimal 
treatment outcome. 
Virologic failure criteria will be evaluated and applied by the Investigator as detailed in 
Section 5.4.1.1.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period should return for a Treatment Discontinuation Visit and undergo the study procedures as outlined in Appendix C and as described in Section 5.5.1.  Ideally, this should occur on the day of 
study drug discontinuation, but is recommended to be no later than 2 days after their final dose of study drug and prior to the initiation of any other anti-HCV therapy if applicable.  Following completion or premature discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects in either Part 1 or Part 2 will be followed in the associated Post-Treatment Period of Part 1 or Part 2.
5.1.3 Post-Treatment Period
All subjects who receive at least one dose of the study drug will enter into the 
Post-Treatment Period.  The Post-Treatment will begin the day following the last dose of study drug treatment and continue through Week 144 as outlined in Appendix C .  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue during the Post-Treatment Period should return to the site for a discontinuation visit and undergo the study procedures as outlined in Appendix C .
Subjects may also return to the site for an unscheduled study visit for additional safety assessments if the investigator or sponsor feels it is necessary.
The Post Treatment Period will assess safety, antiviral response, and growth and 
development.
Growth and development will be assessed using BMI, weight z score, height z score, and 
growth rate at Post-Treatment Weeks 12, 48, 96, 144.  Growth rate is defined as the change in height over change in age from the previous visit.

date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage information including 
dose, route and frequency.  The investigator should review all concomitant medications for any potential interactions.
For subjects on an HIV-1 ART:  information regarding each subjects qualifying, stable 
HIV-1 ART medications including start date, dose and frequency will be recorded into the eCRF at Screening.  In addition, subjects will be requested to record in a HIV-1 Medication Card, the information for the last two doses of their HIV-1 ART medications taken (dosing dates, times, and number of pills) prior to the study visits detailed in Appendix C , and site personnel will record this information in the eCRF.
During the Post-Treatment Period, all medications taken will be recorded until 30 days following the last dose of study drugs.  After 30 days post-treatment, during the Post-Treatment Period, only antiviral therapies related to the treatment of HCV and medications prescribed in association with a serious adverse event (SAE) will be recorded in EDC.  The AbbVie Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapies.

not be eligible for enrollment in the study.
5.2.3.2 Prior HCV Therapy
For Parts 1 and 2, prior or current use of any investigational or commercially available 
anti-HCV agents other than IFN, pegIFN, RBV, or SOF, excludes a subject from this study.  Subjects who previously participated in trials of investigational anti-HCV agents may be enrolled if they can produce documentation that they received only placebo or only SOF/RBV.
Subjects could be HCV treatment-naïve or prior treatment experienced.  Prior treatment, 
such as interferons, with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN, is acceptable.  Subjects will be categorized as:
●Treatment-naïve:  subject has never received any treatment for HCV infection.
●Subjects with an allowed prior treatment will be categorized as:
○Non-responder:   HCV RNA detected at the end of a prior treatment 
course (except for breakthrough, which is captured separately).  These 
subjects are further categorized as:
●Null responder:  failed to achieve a 1 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV 
RNA by Week 4 or a 2 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA by 
Week 12 during a prior treatment course;
●Partial responder:  achieved at least a 2 log 10IU/mL reduction in HCV 
RNA by Week 12 during a prior treatment course but failed to achieve 
HCV RNA undetectable at the end of treatment;
●Unknown or unable to specify:  insufficient data to categorize as null or 
partial responder.
○Breakthrough:   confirmed ≥  1 log 10IU/mL increase from nadir or 
achieved HCV RNA undetectable (or unquantifiable) during a prior treatment course but HCV RNA was quantifiable during or at the end of 
treatment.

○Relapse:   achieved HCV RNA undetectable at the end of a prior treatment 
course but HCV RNA was detectable following cessation of therapy.
○Other:   subject received a prior treatment course and reason for not 
achieving SVR is other than above.
○Unknown:   subject received a prior treatment course and reason for not 
achieving SVR is unknown.
Subjects must have discontinued prior therapy at least 2 months prior to the Screening 
Visit in order to be eligible for the study.
5.2.3.3 Concomitant Therapy
The investigator should confirm that a concomitant medication/supplement can be safely 
administered with study drugs.  Some medications may require dose adjustments due to the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDI).  
During the Post-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess concomitant 
medications/supplements and subjects may resume previously prohibited medications/supplements or revert to pre-study doses, 14 days following discontinuation of study drugs, if applicable.
5.2.3.4 Prohibited Therapy
Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications or supplements 
listed in Table 8 at least 14 days or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of GLE/PIB and not use these during the entire Treatment Period and for 14 days following discontinuation of study drugs.

Ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives
* Some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (including atorvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin) should not be taken with 
the study drugs.  Subjects receiving these statins should either (a) switch to pravastatin or rosuvastatin 14 days or 
10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drugs or (b) may interrupt statin therapy 
throughout the treatment period beginning at least 14 days or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug and until 14 days after the last dose of study drug, based on investigator's judgment.  If 
switching to or continuing pravastatin or rosuvastatin, it is recommended to either 1) reduce or limit the pravastatin or rosuvastatin dose in accordance with the GLE/PIB product label (if approved in the country); or 2) reduce the pravastatin dose by 50% or limit the rosuvastatin dose to 10 mg QD when taking with the study drug if GLE/PIB is not yet approved in the country.
Use of ethinyl estradiol containing oral contraceptives with GLE and PIB combination 
was associated with ALT increases in some healthy female subjects.  Hormonal contraceptives (including oral, topical [including vaginal rings], injectable, or implantable varieties) containing ethinyl estradiol may not be used from 2 weeks prior to the first dose of GLE/PIB until 14 days after the end of GLE/PIB dosing.  Progestin-only contraceptives, such as those containing norethindrone, desogestrel, or levonorgestrel, without ethinyl estradiol, may be used with GLE/PIB.  Hormone replacement therapy i.e., estradiol, esterified or conjugated estrogens, as long as they do not contain ethinyl estradiol, may be used with GLE/PIB at the discretion of the Investigator.
GLE/PIB is not recommended for use in patients requiring stable cyclosporine doses 
> 100 mg per day.  GLE/PIB may be initiated in subjects receiving cyclosporine ≤ 100 mg 
per day and cyclosporine doses may be adjusted up to 400 mg per day following standard therapeutic monitoring practices.

●True abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject [periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable].
For Japan specific sites:  Note that both contraceptive sponge and vaginal ring with 
spermicidal jellies or creams are unapproved in Japan.
For male study subjects no contraception is required.
5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic and Safety 
Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C .
5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Appendix C are discussed in detail in this section with 
the exception of the assessment of concomitant medications (Section 5.2.3), and the 
collection of adverse event information (Section 6.0).  All study data will be recorded in 
the subject's source documentation and then on the appropriate eCRFs, with the exception 
of laboratory data which will be provided to the Sponsor electronically from the laboratory(ies).
Informed Consent/Assent 
Signed study-specific informed consent and assent (as appropriate for age and country) 
will be obtained from the parent(s)/guardian(s) and subject before any study procedures are performed.  If a subject becomes of legal age during the course of the study, the subject will need to be consented using the approved informed consent form.  Details 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
53
about how informed consent and assent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
Section 9.3.
Medical History
A complete medical history, including history of tobacco, nicotine containing products and alcohol use, will be taken from each subject during the Screening Visit.  An updated medical history will be obtained prior to study drug administration and will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at visits specified in Appendix C .  A 
symptom-directed physical examination may be performed at any other visit, when 
necessary.
The physical examination performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the baseline physical 
examination for clinical assessment.  Any significant physical examination findings after the first dose will be recorded as adverse events.
Vital Signs, Weight, Height and Body Mass Index (BMI)
Body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, body weight, height, and BMI will be measured 
at the visits specified in Appendix C , or upon subject discontinuation.  Blood pressure and 
pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes.  The vital signs performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.  Height will be measured standing without shoes using a stadiometer.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram
The ECG obtained at Screening will serve as the baseline assessment.  The ECG should 
be performed prior to blood collection.  An ECG can be performed at subsequent visits if deemed clinically necessary.  
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
54
The ECGs will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site ("local 
reader").  The local reader from the site will sign, and date ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
●Normal ECG
●Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant
●Abnormal ECG – clinically significant
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source.  The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine-generated measurements and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained at a minimum for the clinical laboratory tests outlined in Table 8
at the visits indicated in Appendix C .
An overview about the volume of blood drawn for each of the study visits is listed in 
Appendix D of this protocol.  The Investigator/designee should refer to the local 
recommendations on blood drawn in pediatric patients (e.g., the guide on "Ethical 
Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medical Products With the Pediatric Population" or "Blood Drawing For Human Subject Research" by Duke University ).  The 
Investigator/designee should document exceptions to the local blood loss recommendations in the subject's source along with a justification as appropriate.
At the Study Day 1 visit, a blood sample is to be collected prior to the first dose of study 
drug which is to be administered at site during the visit.  Subjects should be reminded to eat prior to their first dose of study drug after the sample is collected (e.g., suggest they bring a light snack).  Fasting status will be recorded in the source documents and on the laboratory requisition.  The baseline laboratory test results for clinical assessment for a particular test will be defined as the last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.

HBsAg and Anti-HBs) and also performed for management of transaminase elevation (Section 6.1.7.2 ).
Palatability Questionnaire (Acceptability Questionnaire)
The parent(s)/guardian(s) of the subject will complete a Palatability Questionnaire to 
provide feedback on the perception of the dosage form of the pediatric formulation in Part 2.  The parent(s)/guardian(s) of the subject will be asked of their overall impression towards the dosage form and the administration via dosing vehicle to the subject; such as duration of administration, volume of dosing vehicle, swallowability, and the convenience of administration.  
The questionnaire will be completed at the visits as indicated in Appendix C .  The 
parent(s)/guardian(s) will indicate their answers on the questionnaire, which will be kept 
as part of the study record and transcribed into EDC by site personnel.  Site personnel will encourage completion of the questionnaire at all applicable visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items. 
Pregnancy Testing
Females of non-childbearing potential (either pre-menarche and not sexually active or 
permanently surgically sterile as defined in Section 5.2.4) at Screening do not require 
pregnancy testing.  All female subjects who are experiencing menses or are nearing sexual maturation in the opinion of the Investigator, or who are of child-bearing potential:
●A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of 
childbearing potential at Screening.  Additional urine pregnancy tests will be 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
58
performed at all visits indicated in Appendix C .  Pregnancy testing is not 
required for females of non-childbearing potential.
●Urine pregnancy testing will be performed on-site during the study visit if 
there is a scheduled visit.  The pregnancy result will be captured in the source 
document and recorded in the eCRF by site personnel.  If there is not a 
scheduled study visit, subjects may either have pregnancy testing performed at the site as an unscheduled study visit or a urine pregnancy test may be 
conducted by the subject at home with a pregnancy test kit provided by the 
site.  If a urine pregnancy test is performed at home, site personnel should contact these female study subjects to capture the results of any study-related 
pregnancy tests in the source records only.
●If a urine pregnancy result is positive, a confirmatory hCG serum test should 
be collected and sent to the central lab.
Concomitant Medication Assessment
Please refer to Section 5.2.3 .
Hepatitis B and HIV Screen
HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCV Ab and anti-HIV Ab will be performed at 
Screening.  A positive anti-HIV Ab test must be confirmed for subjects without a previous history of HIV infection.  The investigator or his/her representatives must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject's parent(s)/legal guardian(s).  The site will report these results per local regulations, if necessary.
HCV Genotype and Subtype
Plasma samples for HCV genotype and subtype determination will be collected at 
Screening.  Genotype and subtype will be assessed using the Versant®HCV Genotype 
Inno LiPA Assay, Version 2.0 or higher (LiPA; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY) by the central laboratory.  If the LiPA assay is unable to genotype a sample, its genotype/subtype will be determined by a Sanger sequencing assay of a region of the NS5B gene by the central laboratory.

HCV RNA Levels
Plasma samples for HCV RNA levels will be collected as indicated in Appendix C .  
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by the central 
laboratory using the Roche COBAS®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan HCV Quantitative 
Test, v2.0.  The lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for this assay (regardless of genotype) are both 15 IU/mL.  
Historical Liver Biopsy or FibroScan or Screening FibroTest
An assessment of liver fibrosis is mandatory prior to enrollment.  Subjects with no history 
of cirrhosis that have not had a liver biopsy within 24 months or FibroScan within 6 months prior to screening will undergo a non-invasive FibroTest to determine presence or absence of cirrhosis. 
Subject must be documented as non-cirrhotic or cirrhotic defined as meeting one of the 
following criteria:
Non-Cirrhotic
●A liver biopsy within 24 months prior to or during Screening demonstrating 
the absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, 
Scheuer, New Inuyama, or Laennec fibrosis score of ≤ 3, Ishak fibrosis score 
of ≤ 4; or
●A FibroScan
®score of < 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period; or
●A Screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.72
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34

Cirrhotic
●Previous histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on liver biopsy, e.g., METAVIR, 
Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, New Inuyama, or Laennec fibrosis 
score of > 3, Ishak score of > 4 or on a liver biopsy conducted during Screening; or
●A FibroScan
®score of ≥  12.5 kPa within ≤  6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period; or
●A Screening FibroTest result that is > 0.72.
The resulting cirrhosis status and HCV genotype/subtype will be documented via 
recording in the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system for each subject todetermine the duration and regimen of the study drug for each subject.
For subjects participating in sites specific to Japan, cirrhosis determination may be 
performed (in addition to the methods listed above) using the following Discriminant Score criteria at the time of screening:
●Non-Cirrhotic:  screening Discriminant Score (z) less than zero, according to 
the following formula:  z = 0.124 × [gamma-globulin (%)] + 0.001 × [hyaluronate ( μg × l
–1)] –0.075 × [platelet (× 104cells/mm3)] – 0.413 × gender 
(male, 1; female, 2) – 2.005.
○Subjects with indeterminate Discriminant Score (score = 0), must have a 
qualifying FibroScan®or liver biopsy.
●Cirrhotic:  screening Discriminant Score (z) greater than zero, according to the following formula:  z = 0.124 × [gamma-globulin (%)] + 0.001 × [hyaluronate ( μg × l
–1)] –0.075 × [platelet (× 104cells/mm3)] – 0.413 × gender

FibroTest and APRI at PT Weeks 12, 48, 96 and 144 or premature discontinuation.  Any subject that does not have a FibroTest and APRI performed during Screening will have them performed at Day 1.
Child-Pugh Score and Category
The Child-Pugh score will be calculated and documented prior to Day 1 visit for cirrhotic 
subjects only.  Subjects who were considered to be non-cirrhotic at the screening visit but identified as cirrhotic (according to definitions listed here) during the screening process will return to the site prior to the Day 1 visit for Child-Pugh assessment.  Any subject with a Child-Pugh > 6 prior to the Day 1 visit will no longer be eligible for study participation.
The Child-Pugh score uses five clinical measures of liver disease (3 laboratory parameters 
and 2 clinical assessments).  Child-Pugh score will be determined at the screening visit as indicated in Appendix C .  The Child-Pugh score will be automatically calculated prior to 
Day 1 by EDC (RAVE) once the investigator or designated site personnel enters the subject's parameters (as listed in Table 9).  A total score of 5 – 6 is considered Class A 
(compensated disease); 7 – 9 is Class B (significant functional compromise); and 10 – 15 is Class C (decompensated disease).

HCV Resistance Testing Plasma Sample
A plasma sample for baseline HCV resistance testing will be collected on Day 1 from all 
subjects in Part 1, and from subjects in Part 2 in which the sample for baseline HCV resistance testing will be within the allowable blood volume limits.  HCV resistance testing is required for all subjects who meet virologic failure criteria at the visits indicated in Appendix C .  Specific instructions for preparation and storage of the samples will be 
provided by the central laboratory, the Sponsor, or its designee.
Flow Cytometry, HIV-1 RNA and HIV Resistance Testing Samples
For subjects co-infected with HIV-1, samples for plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and flow 
cytometry (including but not limited to CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell counts [absolute and percent]) will be obtained at the times specified in Appendix C .  Plasma HIV-1 RNA 
will be measured by the central laboratory using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, version 2.0 HIV-1 Assay.  Results below the LLOD are reported as:  "Not Detected."
If a subject's HIV-1 RNA level is ≥ 200 copies/mL, the subject's HIV-1 RNA is to be 
repeated as noted in Section 5.4.1.2.  At the time the repeat plasma HIV-1 RNA is drawn, 
a sample should be obtained for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing.  If the subject's repeat 
HIV-1 RNA is ≥  500 copies/mL, the sample obtained for HIV-1 genotypic resistance 
testing may be analyzed.
HIV-1 protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) sequences, as 
applicable, will be analyzed by Monogram Biosciences using the GenoSure
®Prime drug 
resistance assay.
If the subject's repeat HIV-1 RNA is < 200 copies/mL, then the subject will resume 
routine plasma HIV-1 RNA assessments as shown in Appendix C and described in 
Section 5.4.1.2.

Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Instrument (PedsQL)
Subjects will complete the PRO instrument, PedsQL, with the assistance of a 
parent/guardian (where allowed per local regulatory guidelines) on the study days specified in Appendix C .  The PRO should be administered as the first procedure at each 
visit.  Subjects will be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Site personnel will encourage completion of each instrument at all applicable visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
The PedsQL Generic Core Scales is a 23 item questionnaire designed to measure the core 
dimension of health as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), in addition role (school) functioning.  The PedsQL consists of 4 Multidimensional Scales (Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning) and 3 Summary Scores (Total Scale Score, Physical Health Summary Score, and Psychosocial Health Summary Score).  Completion of the PedsQL should take around 4 minutes to complete.  Subjects who are older than 5-years of age and are able to read and understand the questions should complete the questionnaire by themselves.  For subjects who are 5-years of age or younger or who are not comfortable with reading the questions, their parent(s)/guardian(s) should complete the parent/guardian proxy-report.

be summarized separately.
5.3.4 HCV Resistance Variables
For all subjects receiving GLE/PIB and with available samples, baseline polymorphisms 
at signature resistance associated amino acid positions identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving GLE/PIB 
who do not achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA 
≥1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid substitutions in available post-baseline samples 
identified by NGS and comparison to the corresponding baseline sequences, 2) the amino acid substitutions in available post-baseline samples at signature resistance-associated positions identified by NGS and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral substitutions by NGS.
5.3.5 Safety Variables
The following safety evaluations will be analyzed during the study:  adverse events, vital 
signs, physical examination, and laboratory test assessments.  
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34

5.3.6 Growth and Development Variables
The following evaluations for growth and development outcomes will be analyzed during 
the study:  growth rate, weight and height z score, and BMI standardized score.
5.3.7 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Individual plasma concentrations of GLE and PIB will be measured for Part 1 and Part 2.  
Values for the pharmacokinetic parameters of GLE and PIB including the C max, Tmax, 
Ctrough, and area under the concentration curve (AUC) will be determined by non-
compartmental methods using data from subjects who participate in the initial intensive 
PK sample collection and evaluation.  
Individual model-predicted steady-state AUC values for GLE and PIB corresponding to 
the final proposed doses will be estimated by population pharmacokinetic analysis.
Additional parameters may be determined if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigatorconsiders it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.
If a subject prematurely discontinues during the Treatment Period, Post-Treatment Period 
or the Long-term Follow-up Period, the procedures outlined for the applicable Premature D/C Visit should be completed as defined in Appendix C .  Ideally for study drug 
discontinuation, this should occur on the day of study drug discontinuation, but no later than 2 days after their final dose of study drug and prior to the initiation of any other anti-HCV therapy.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
72
treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be 
treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment and monitored for HCV RNA and the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions in the post-treatment period.  The last dose of any study drug and reason for discontinuation from the Treatment Period will be recorded in the EDC system.
If a subject has an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved laboratory result that is 
significantly outside of the reference range at the time of study drug discontinuation, the investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved.
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject 
reports becoming pregnant during the Treatment Period, the DAAs may be continued at the investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject and parent(s)/guardian(s), if the benefit of continuing DAAs is felt to outweigh the potential risk.  Specific instructions regarding subject pregnancy can be found in Section 6.1.6.  Subjects will be monitored for 
SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3.
5.4.1.1 HCV Virologic Failure Criteria
The following criteria will be considered evidence of HCV virologic failure for the 
purposes of subject management: 
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV 
RNA measurements of > 1 log
10IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during 
treatment; or 
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥  100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during treatment.
When confirmatory testing is required it should be completed as soon as possible and the 
subject should remain on study treatment until the HCV virologic failure criterion has been confirmed.  Subjects meeting a virologic failure criterion will be discontinued from 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
73
study drug and will continue to be followed in the Post-Treatment Period for the 
emergence and persistence of resistant viral variants until 144 weeks post-treatment.
5.4.1.2 Failure to Maintain HIV Virologic Suppression
HIV-1 RNA will be assessed at scheduled study visits during the Treatment and Post-
Treatment Period, as detailed in Appendix C .
The criteria for failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression among subjects on stable ARTs is as follows:
●HIV-1 RNA ≥  200 copies/mL confirmed on 2 consecutive tests at least 
2 weeks apart, in a subject compliant with their HIV ART therapy.
At the time a confirmatory HIV-1 RNA is drawn, a sample for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing should also be obtained; this sample may be analyzed if the subject's repeat plasma HIV-1 RNA is ≥  500 copies/mL.  A subject should remain on HCV study drug treatment 
and his/her current ART regimen while the failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression is being confirmed.  A confirmatory HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 genotypic resistance blood draw can be done as an unscheduled visit.  However, if this blood draw falls on the date of 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
74
a scheduled study visit ( Appendix C ), only a single HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 genotypic 
resistance blood draw needs to be performed at this visit.  
During the Treatment Period, subjects with confirmed failure to maintain HIV-1 RNA 
suppression should continue study drug treatment unless there is a requirement for prohibited concomitant medications (see Section 5.2.3.1) to construct a new HIV ART 
regimen.
Clinical management of failure to maintain HIV-1 virologic suppression during the study 
(Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Period) will be handled by the site investigator according to current HIV treatment guidelines and local standard of care.  
If the investigator wishes to change the HIV-1 ART regimen for a subject, it must be 
discussed with the AbbVie Study Designated Physician prior to the change being made, unless the change is being made to address an immediate safety concern.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Each dose of open-label DAA study drugs (GLE and PIB) will be dispensed in the form

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
At the Screening Visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the 
use of IRT.  For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria (or who are unable to enroll before enrollment has closed), the site personnel must contact the IRT system and identify the subject as a screen failure.
First, the subjects in the ≥ 12 to 18 year age group of the intensive PK portion of Part 1 
who are ≥ 45 kg and willing to swallow the adult formulations will be enrolled.  
Enrollment into the safety/efficacy portion of Part 1 will begin when the dosing 
recommendations of GLE/PIB adult formulation are available based on the pharmacokinetic and clinical data from the intensive PK part of Part 1 (Section 5.1).  
Enrollment into the intensive PK portion of Part 2 will begin with the current proposed doses in Table 11 .  Enrollment into the safety/efficacy portion of each of the age groups in 
Part 2 will begin when the dosing recommendations per age group of GLE/PIB pediatric formulation are available based on the pharmacokinetic and clinical data from the intensive PK part of Part 2 (Section 5.1).  Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number assigned at the Screening Visit throughout the study.
In Part 1 of the study, the cap on the number of subjects in IRT will be employed to 
ensure that approximately 44 subjects are enrolled.
In Part 2 of the study, caps on the number of subjects in each age group (3 to < 6, 6 to < 9, 
9 to < 12 years of age) will be employed in IRT to ensure that approximately 22 subjects on the final recommended dose regardless of prior treatment experience and cirrhotic status are enrolled per age group.
Contact information and user guidelines for IRT use will be available for each study site.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the doses for this study is discussed in Section 5.6.5.  The daily dose for each 
subject in Part 1 will be assigned by IRT as the standard 300/120 mg dosing.  The daily 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir

Pibentasvir 8.25%.  
Study drug dosing will be initiated at the Study Da y 1 Visit.  GLE/PIB will be dosed QD.  
All study drugs should be dosed together and administered with food at approximately the 
same time every day.
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open-label study.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol.
All study drugs will be dispensed to subjects by study-site personnel under the direction 
of the investigator.  At the start of the study, each subject along with their parent(s)/guardian(s) should receive counseling regarding the importance of dosing adherence with the treatment regimen with regard to virologic response and potential development of resistance.  The start and stop dates of all study drugs will be recorded in the source documents and eCRFs.
During the Treatment Period, subjects will be instructed to bring all study drug units (full, 
partial or empty) to the study site at each study visit.  The study site personnel will inspect the contents of the study drug units and account for the returned study drug electronically at each Study Drug Accountability visit indicated in Appendix C .  If poor adherence is 
noted, the subject and parent(s)/guardian(s) should be counseled and this should be documented in the subject's source document.

5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The investigator or his/her representative will verify that study drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by signing and dating the Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar document and via recording in the IRT system.  A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be kept per subject by the investigator.  An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by the AbbVie monitor throughout the Treatment Period.  The monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.  Final accountability will be verified by the monitor at the end of study drug treatment at the site.
During the study, should an enrolled subject misplace or damage a study drug unit, the 
IRT system must be contacted and informed of the misplaced or damaged study drug.  If the study drug unit is damaged, the subject will be requested to return the remaining study drug to the site.  Replacement study drug may only be dispensed to the subject by contacting the IRT system.  Study drug replacement(s) and an explanation of the reason for the misplaced or damaged study drug(s) will be documented within the subject's source.  Date of the first dose and the last dose of the regimen will be documented in the subject's source documents and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
The return status of each study drug unit and the date of reconciliation will be documented 
at Study Drug Accountability Visits in Appendix C .
Detailed instructions regarding study drug accountability are provided below. 
Adult Formulation 
The number of tablets of each type of study drug returned in each bottle will be noted in 
the IRT system and on a drug accountability log (if appropriate).  Labels must remain affixed to the bottles.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
81
Pediatric Formulation
The status of each returned bottle or sachet will be noted in the IRT system and on a drug 
accountability log (if appropriate).  The Investigator/designee must document the status of the returned bottles or sachets as "full sealed" or "empty" or "unsealed but not empty" in the IRT system.  Labels must remain affixed to the bottles.
Upon completion of or discontinuation from the Treatment Period, all original study drug 
units (containing unused study drugs) will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed on site.  All destruction procedures will be according to instructions from the Sponsor and according to local regulations following completion of drug accountability procedures.  All empty original study drug units shall be disposed of onsite following completion of study drug accountability and reconciliation procedures.  Labels must remain attached to the study drug units.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design
The combination regimen of GLE/PIB completed registrational Phase 3 trials in adults in 
several countries including the US, the EU, and Japan.  The dose, durations, and regimens have been optimized in adults.  These same durations and regimens are anticipated to be similarly successful in children as long as the drug exposures are comparable, so further regimen/duration exploration is not warranted.  In addition, no interferon-free regimens or ribavirin free regimens are approved for use in children less than 12 years old; the historical standard of care (pegIFN/RBV) has notably lower efficacy rates and a worse safety profile than the interferon-free DAA regimens and requires longer treatment duration, making a comparative study unethical and difficult to enroll.  A non-randomized study design with regimens/duration and drug exposure comparable to the recommended adult regimens is the best method for evaluation.

EudraCT 2016-004102-34
82
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard pharmacokinetic, statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized 
in this study.  HCV RNA assays are standard and validated.  The PedsQL instrument is standard in the literature and thoroughly validated in studies of the pediatric population and in pediatric subjects who have chronic health conditions.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
This is a multicenter, Phase 2/3, open label study in treatment naïve and treatment 
experienced HCV GT1 – 6 infected pediatric subjects, with and without compensated cirrhosis, with or without HIV-1 co-infection, designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of GLE/PIB administered QD for 8, 12 or 16 weeks.  Evaluation for the treatment duration is supported by the data from the Registrational program with high SVR and favorable safety profile in adults.  Evaluation of the dosages to be used in this population is supported by current pharmacokinetic data in adults, based on multiple Phase 1 and 2 studies, with modeling to support the intended pediatric dosing. 
This study plans to enroll subjects from ≥ 3 to < 18 years old with genotype 1 – 6 HCV 
infection as agreed upon in the Pediatric Investigation Plans (PIP) and Pediatric Study 
Plan (PSP).  The older subjects who are willing to swallow the adult formulations and are ≥ 45 kg will be studied using the adult co-formulated tablets.  A pediatric formulation of the DAAs has been developed for children in the ≥ 3 to < 12 year old age groups.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
In the PIP and the PSP for Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir, the proposed pediatric doses were targeting providing comparable exposures to adult subjects.
AbbVie has developed a separate pediatric formulation for GLE + PIB for use in Part 2 of 
the present study.  
The mg doses for a given weight range for each of the age groups as proposed in the PIP 
and PSP were adjusted to express each age group dose as a multiple of a proposed unit 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
83
dose of a sachet, which provides a simplified dosing approach for patients and physicians 
and is expected to help reduce potential dispensing and dosing errors while meeting the objectives of the weight based dosing.  Given the wide therapeutic window of GLE and PIB, the updated doses will not anticipate to change the efficacy/safety profiles.
For the present study, the final proposed doses by weight band range are shown in 
Table 11.
Table 11. Proposed Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir Doses for the Pediatric 
Population

9 to < 12 yr
≥ 30 to < 45 kg250 100
Adult formulation 12 to < 18 yr
≥ 45 kg300 120
The doses of the pediatric formulation were adjusted based upon the intensive pharmacokinetic analysis of the first approx. 17 subjects enrolled across the age cohorts.  The final proposed dosing for each age cohort has been confirmed by additional IPK analysis. These drug dose changes are included in this protocol amendment.  Dose adjustments were made as necessary to ensure safe and efficacious exposures, but did not exceed the adult dose of 300/120 mg of GLE/PIB.
For Part 1, enrollment commenced with pediatric subjects ≥ 12 to < 18 years old who are 
≥45 kg and willing to swallow the adult formulation.  Part 2 enrollment initiated in 
pediatric subjects ≥ 3 to < 12 years old with the pediatric formulation.  Based on current 
modeling and available PK data at the completion of the IPK portion of Part 2, the above 
proposed doses of the pediatric formulation are the target doses for use in children 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
84
< 12 years of age.  The pharmacokinetic and clinical data will be used to confirm 
appropriate exposure in each of the ≥ 3 to < 12 years old age groups.  
Details on the dose adjustment considerations for Part 1, the enrollment sequence in Part 1, and the considerations for enrollment in Part 2 are provided in Section 5.1.
5.6.5 Maximum Dose
For Parts 1 and 2, the maximum dose of GLE and PIB will not exceed 300 mg and 120 mg per day for 16 weeks.
6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for distribution.
Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2).  For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.1
through 6.1.7.1.  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an "Other" cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3

All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity 
management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
86
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.

M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
87
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4).
The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI CTC AE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific grading details for that AE entity.
Grading System for Adverse Events (a semi-colon indicates 'or' within the description of 
the grade).
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL*
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility An adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated.
For serious adverse events, if an investigator's opinion of "no reasonable possibility of 
being related to study drug" is given, an "Other" cause of event must be provided by the investigator.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related non-serious adverse events 
(e.g., infection at liver biopsy site) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study treatment has elapsed, all adverse events will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  After 30 days following completion of study treatment and throughout the Post-Treatment Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (non-serious 
AEs will not be collected).
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by entering the serious adverse event data into the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.

AbbVie will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local guidelines and Appendix A of the Investigator Brochure will serve as the Reference Safety Information (RSI).  The RSI in effect at the start of a DSUR reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting period.  For follow-up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 'suspected' Serious Adverse Reaction will be used to assess expectedness.
6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Administration of study drug may be continued at the 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
91
investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if the benefit of continuing 
therapy is felt to outweigh the risk (Section 5.4.1).  If a subject is discontinued, the subject 
will be monitored for SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.4.1.
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected for pregnancies occurring up to 30 days after the end of treatment. 
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.7 Toxicity Management
For the purpose of medical management, all adverse events and laboratory abnormalities 
that occur during the study must be evaluated by the investigator.  All adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be managed and followed to a satisfactory clinical resolution.  Toxicity is deemed "clinically significant" based on the medical judgment of the investigator.  The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is to be used in the grading of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities which is available on the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf.
Specific toxicity management guidelines apply to the instances of increases in ALT 
(Section 6.1.7.2).
Where an interruption is required the study drugs should not be interrupted for more than 7 days.  If study drugs need to be interrupted for more than 7 days, the Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director should be contacted and consideration should be given to discontinue the subject.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
92
6.1.7.1 Severe Adverse Events
If a subject experiences a severe adverse event (Grade 3+) or a serious adverse event that 
the investigator considers to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug, the investigator should assess whether the adverse event can be managed medically without interruption of study drug, or whether study drugs should be interrupted until the event improves.  If study drugs are interrupted and restarted and the adverse event recurs, then study drugs should be permanently discontinued.
If a subject experiences a severe adverse event (Grade 3+) or serious adverse event that is 
considered unrelated (no reasonable possibility) to the study drugs, it is not necessary to interrupt study drugs unless an interruption is required because of the nature of the event (e.g., unable to take oral medications).
The investigator should ensure that all serious adverse events are reported to AbbVie 
within 24 hours of awareness.  Serious adverse event follow-up information, including associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations), must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of awareness by entering updated SAE information into the appropriate eCRFs.
Severe adverse events and any associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations) should 
be entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
6.1.7.2 Management of ALT Elevations
If the ALT increase is confirmed to be > 5 × ULN which is also > 2 × baseline value, the 
recommendations below should be followed:
●Evaluate for alternate etiology of ALT elevation; document in the source, 
update the medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable), 
and obtain additional testing as appropriate.
●Evaluate for a new viral hepatitis infection, including hepatitis A, B and E.
○If the subject is found to have an active hepatitis B infection, additional 
evaluation by completion of the eCRF Transaminase Elevations Questionnaire should be performed by the investigator.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
93
●Manage the subject as medically appropriate.
●Repeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and 
international normalized ratio (INR) within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
●Discontinue study drugs if any of the following is observed at any time:
○ALT level is ≥ 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
○Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of symptoms/signs of hepatitis.
○At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of ALT increases is permitted with approval of the Primary 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
If the investigator wishes to pursue alternative management of study drugs in the setting 
of confirmed ALT increases described above, then approval of the Primary Therapeutic Area Medical Director must be obtained.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
drug component of the product.
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), missing components/product, or packaging issues.
Any information available to help in the determination of causality to the events outlined 
directly above should be captured.

6.2.2 Reporting
Product Complaints concerning the investigational product must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event via the Product Complaint form.  Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a satisfactory conclusion.  All follow-up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the Sponsor.  Product Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition.  In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days.  If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to 
investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol unless when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The principal investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified) after a subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notifying Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) regulatory authorities (as applicable), and the following AbbVie Clinical Monitor(s):

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The analysis of pharmacokinetic endpoints will be performed when 12 subjects complete the 2 week intensive PK (IPK) measurements, and these analyses will be done within each age group.  For subjects enrolled in Japan, the pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized separately.
The efficacy, durability of response, resistance, growth and development, patient-reported 
outcomes, and safety analyses will be performed by age group and overall (across Parts 1 and 2 combined).  
The first interim analysis will occur once all subjects participating in IPK in Part 1 
complete PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinue from the study.  A second interim analysis will occur once all subjects in Part 1 complete PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinue from the study.  A third interim analysis will occur once all subjects participating in the IPK portion in Part 2 complete PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinue from the study.  A fourth interim analysis will occur once all subjects in 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
96
Parts 1 and 2 complete PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinue the study.  Final analysis 
will occur after the completion of the whole study.
SAS®(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) for the UNIX operating system will be used for all 
analyses.  All statistical tests and all confidence intervals will be two-sided with alpha 
level of 0.05. 
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
drug.
Demographic and efficacy analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population defined as all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug, unless otherwise specified.
Sensitivity analyses of the SVR
12endpoint, when applicable, will be performed on the 
intention-to-treat population modified to exclude subjects who did not achieve SVR 12for 
reasons other than virologic failure (mITT-VF).No data will be imputed for any efficacy or safety analysis except for analyses of SVR 
endpoints (HCV RNA data).  HCV RNA values will be selected for the analyses of all SVR endpoints (e.g., SVR
4, SVR 12, and SVR 24) based on defined statistical visit 
windows.  A backward imputation method will be used to impute missing responses for SVR analyses.  Detailed statistical methods for all endpoints will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
8.1.1 Demographics
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by age group and overall.  
As a sensitivity analysis, subjects who receive a dose lower than the final dose chosen for the subject's age group might be summarized separately.  The baseline value refers to the last non-missing measurement collected before the first dose of study drug is received in Part 1 or Part 2.  Demographics include age, birth year, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), BMI z score (BMI z score will be calculated using WHO published BMI-for-age 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3

z-score tables), weight and height z scores (weight and height z scores will be calculated 
using WHO published weight-for-age z-score and height-for-age z-score tables), gender, race ethnicity, geographic region and country.  Baseline characteristics will include HCV genotype, prior HCV treatment history if applicable, baseline platelets (< 90 or ≥90 × 10
9/L), baseline albumin (< 35 or ≥ 35 g/L), baseline alpha fetoprotein (< 20 or 
≥20 ng/mL), baseline HCV RNA levels (continuous) and (< 1,000,000, ≥ 1,000,000 to 
< 2,000,000, ≥ 2,000,000 IU/mL), baseline fibrosis stage (F0-1, F2, F3, F4), baseline 
Fibrotest score, baseline APRI, and baseline Child-Pugh score (non-cirrhotic, 5 or 6).  
Descriptive statistics will be provided, such as the number of observations (N), mean, and 
standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables (e.g., age, weight and height z-score) and counts and percentages for discrete variables (e.g., gender and race).
8.1.2 Primary, Secondary, and Efficacy Analyses
The primary and secondary analyses of PK parameters will be performed on subjects in 
the ITT population with available PK samples, unless otherwise specified.
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population unless otherwise specified.

Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
102
health, as well as role (school) functioning.  The PedQL consists of 4 multidimensional 
scales (Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning) and 3 summary scales (Total Scale Score, Physical Health Summary Score, and Psychosocial Health Summary Score).
Across subjects enrolled in Part 1 and 2 (based on ITT population), summary statistics of 
change from baseline (n, mean, SD, minimum and maximum) of 3 summary scale scores will be provided by age group and overall.  In addition the same summaries will be created separately for subjects who complete all the questionnaires by themselves and for subjects whose parent(s)/guardian(s) always complete the parent/guardian proxy-report.
8.1.5 Safety
The secondary safety endpoints are rates of adverse events and clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities.  All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  The safety analysis will be carried out for all subjects by for each age group and overall.  Subjects who receive a dose lower than the final dose chosen for the subject's age group might be summarized separately.  A listing of any SAEs recorded in the Post-Treatment Period will be included.
8.1.5.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug through 30 days post-study drug dosing) will be tabulated by primary MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events by grade (Grades 1 – 5) and relationship to study drug also will be provided.

M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
103
8.1.5.2 Clinical Laboratory Data
Clinical laboratory tests will be summarized at each visit.  The baseline value will be the 
last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.  Mean changes from baseline to each post baseline visit will be summarized descriptively.
The number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-specified 
criteria for toxicity grades during treatment will be summarized.
8.1.5.3 Vital Signs Data

and BMI from Day 1 to each post baseline visit will be summarized descriptively. 
8.1.6 Resistance Analysis
8.1.6.1 HCV Drug-Resistance Analyses
The secondary endpoint of resistance associated viral variants will be analyzed as follows.  
For all subjects in Part 1 and subjects with available samples in Part 2, full length NS3/4A or NS5A from baseline samples will be sequenced by NGS.  For all subjects who experience virologic failure (on-treatment virologic failure or post-treatment relapse), full length NS3/4A and NS5A genes from the first sample after virologic failure with HCV RNA ≥  1000 IU/mL will be sequenced by NGS.  An appropriate subtype-specific 
prototypic reference sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.  Subjects treated with study drug who do not achieve SVR
12due to reasons other than 
virologic failure but have a time point with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL after treatment 
discontinuation, will have the sample at that time point sequenced. 
Only samples with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will undergo sequence analysis 
in order to allow accurate assessment of products of amplification.  Therefore, if the 
HCV RNA level at the time of HCV virologic failure or treatment discontinuation is < 1000 IU/mL, the sample closest in time after HCV virologic failure/treatment discontinuation with an HCV RNA level ≥  1000 IU/mL will be used.  Included time 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
104
points for analyses on samples from subjects who do not achieve SVR12 are 1) the 
sample closest in time after failure/discontinuation with an HCV RNA level of ≥1000 IU/mL, and 2) 24 weeks post-DAA treatment, provided that resistance-associated 
substitutions were detected by NGS at the time of HCV virologic failure/treatment discontinuation.
For each DAA target, signature amino acid positions and a key subset of amino acid 
positions are listed in Table 12 Appropriate subtype specific prototypic reference 
sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.

The following definitions will be used in the resistance analyses:
●Baseline polymorphism:  an amino acid polymorphism by NGS in a baseline 
sample (≥ 2% or ≥  15% prevalence within a subject's viral population 
depending on polymorphism frequency threshold utilized) that was not present 
in the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA 
target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
●Polymorphism/substitution at signature amino acid position:  polymorphism 
(relative to reference) present in a baseline or substitution (relative to baseline) 
present in a post-baseline sample at a signature amino acid position.
●Post-baseline substitution:  an amino acid substitution in a post-baseline time 
point sample that was not detected at baseline (< 2%) in the subject and is 
detectable in ≥ 2% of the sequences from the post-baseline sample.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
105
●Enriched polymorphism:  polymorphism present in both the baseline and a 
post-baseline sample whose prevalence in the post-baseline sample is at least 
20 percentage points greater than the prevalence in the baseline sample [(post-baseline % – baseline %) ≥ 20].
●Treatment-emergent substitution by NGS:  A post-baseline substitution or an enriched polymorphism.
Analysis 1:   The following analyses will be provided for all subjects with baseline 
sequence data, separated by HCV subtype:
●A listing of all baseline polymorphisms (2% detection threshold) at signature 
resistance-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target (NS3/4A and 
NS5A). 
●A listing of all baseline polymorphisms (15% detection threshold) at non-
signature resistance-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target 
(NS3/4A and NS5A) for subjects who experience virologic failure.
●A by subject listing of baseline polymorphisms (15% detection threshold) at 
signature amino acid positions in subjects with polymorphisms across both 
NS3 and NS5A, or those with multiple baseline polymorphisms within any one target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
●The number and percentage of subjects with baseline polymorphisms at signature amino acid positions at detection thresholds of 2% and 15%.
●Total number and percentage of subjects with baseline polymorphisms at a key 
subset of amino acid positions in NS3 only, in NS5A only, any in NS3, any in 
NS5A, any in NS3 or NS5A, any in NS3 + NS5A, by subtype, and total  (include all subtypes).
Analysis 2:   The impact of baseline polymorphisms on treatment outcome will be 
assessed as follows:  for each polymorphism, the SVR12 rate will be calculated for 
subjects with and without the polymorphism and the 2 rates will be compared using Fisher's exact test.  Analysis will be grouped by HCV subtype and DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
106
The following will be included in the analyses of impact of baseline polymorphisms on 
treatment outcome:
●For each signature amino acid position, presence of any polymorphism at that 
position (vs no polymorphism at that position), using detection thresholds of 
both 2% and 15%.  
●Each individual polymorphism at each signature amino acid position (vs not 
that polymorphism) using detection thresholds of 2% and 15%.
●Polymorphisms at each non-signature amino acid position at a detection 
threshold of 15%.
Analysis 3:   In subjects with or without polymorphisms in NS3 only, in NS5A only, any 
in NS3, any in NS5A, any in NS3 or NS5A, any in NS3 + NS5A at the key subset of 
amino acid positions at 15% detection threshold, the SVR 12rate will be calculated, and 
the rates with or without polymorphisms will be compared using Fisher's exact test.  Analysis will be separated by HCV subtype.  The following tables will be provided:
●Comparison of SVR
12rates by subtype, and total (include all subtypes)
●Comparison of SVR 12rates by genotype, and total (include all subtypes)
Analysis 4:   The following analyses will be performed for subjects who do not achieve 
SVR 12and who have post-baseline resistance data available:
●Listings by subject of all treatment-emergent substitutions relative to the 
baseline amino acid sequences will be provided for each DAA target (NS3/4A 
and NS5A).
●Listings by subject and time point of all post-baseline substitutions at signature 
amino acid positions relative to the baseline amino acid sequence will be 
provided for each DAA target (NS3/4A and NS5A).
The persistence of post-baseline substitutions at signature amino acid positions for each 
target will be assessed by NGS through Post-Treatment Week 144.  A listing by subject 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
107
and time point of all post-baseline substitutions relative to the baseline amino acid 
sequence will be provided for each DAA target.
If resistance-associated substitutions are not detected in a given target for a subject at the 
time of failure/discontinuation, then that target may not be sequenced in subsequent samples from that subject.
HCV Genotype/Subtype
Phylogenetic analysis will be conducted on HCV NS3/4A and/or NS5A sequence from 
baseline samples from subjects in Part 1, and from subjects with available samples  in Part 2 in order to accurately determine genotype/subtype.  If the phylogenetic analysis is not available, then the result from Sanger sequencing of a region of NS5B by AbbVie or by the Central laboratory will be used to determine the subject's HCV genotype/subtype, if available.  Finally, if neither the phylogenetic analysis result nor the Sanger sequencing assay results is available, then the Inno-LIPA assay results from the Central laboratory will be used to categorize the subject.  This information will be presented in summaries of efficacy subgroup analyses.
8.1.6.2 HIV Drug-Resistance Analyses
If a subject develops a confirmed, plasma HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 500 copies/mL after 
starting the study, the subject's HIV-1 PR, RT, and/or IN sequences, as applicable, will be 
analyzed by Monogram Biosciences using the GenoSure
®Prime drug resistance assays.  
The number of subjects who demonstrate HIV genotypic resistance and the genotypic resistant mutations detected in the samples obtained from these subjects will be tabulated and summarized.  Resistance will be defined as described by the IAS-USA Panel.

Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
108
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis or population pharmacokinetic analysis will 
be performed to facilitate potential GLE and PIB dose modification in each age group.  
Values for the pharmacokinetic parameters of GLE and PIB including the C max, Ctrough, 
and AUC will be tabulated and summarized for subjects by age group, actual dose 
administered, and overall.  Additional parameters or summaries may be determined if useful in the interpretation of the data.
Plasma concentration data from Part 1 and Part 2 of this study may be combined with data 
from other studies and analyzed using the following general methodology.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time 
relative to dosing.  Pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect modeling approach with the NONMEM software.  The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of data from previous studies.  Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of the PK analytes will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.  
Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error 
structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional estimation technique using NONMEM.
Relationship between exposure and clinical observations (antiviral activity) will be 
explored.  Exposure-response relationships for primary and secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.  
The relationship between exposure (e.g., population pharmacokinetic model predicted 
concentrations over time or average concentrations or AUC or trough concentrations of the individual model-predicted pharmacokinetic profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and antiviral activity will be explored using graphical and/or logistic regression analyses. 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34
109
Additionally, relationship between exposure and efficacy/safety endpoints of interest may 
also be explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is planned to enroll a total of approximately 125 subjects into this study.  The primary 
endpoint will be steady state AUC of GLE and PIB.  Practical considerations include the expected larger number of adolescents within this population, in comparison to the younger age cohorts.
The proposed sample size of 48 subjects (12 subjects for each age cohort) for intensive 
pharmacokinetic sampling (separate from sampling performed in subjects in Japan) is expected to adequately characterize the pharmacokinetics of GLE and PIB to enable dose selection in pediatric subjects. 
Approximately 10 subjects will undergo additional PK sampling to support 
characterization of GLE and PIB exposures in children from Japan.
Additional subjects will be enrolled to reach the proposed total of 125 subjects to provide 
safety and efficacy information.
8.3 Randomization Methods
There is no randomization in this study.  Enrolled subjects will receive treatment per the 
planned study schematic outlined in Section 5.1.2.

* The EOT visit can be at Week 8, Week 12, or Week 16 in accordance with Section 5.1 and activities should be conducted that are  located in the EOT column.  Treatment 
duration will be assigned according to Subjects HCV genotype, cirrhosis and prior HCV treatment experience status. 
a. All procedures to be performed prior to first dose, with the exception of the PK sample which will be obtained 4 hours post-dose.
b. The Week 8 study visits apply to all subjects whose treatment duration is 12 weeks and 16 weeks in accordance with Section 5.1.  The Week 12 study visits apply to all 
subjects whose treatment duration is 16 weeks in accordance with Section 5.1.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue the Treatment Period should return to the site to 
complete the Premature D/C Visit Procedures (preferably prior to the initiation of any other anti-HCV therapy).  
c. Parent(s)/guardian(s) need to sign an IRB/IEC approved informed consent for the study prior to performing any screening or st udy-specific procedures.  Additionally an 
assent from the subject will be obtained to meet the institution's IEC requirements, as applicable.
d. A complete medical history will be taken at Screening and will be updated at the Study Day 1 Visit prior to study drug administration and will serve as the Baseline for 
clinical assessment.
e. A symptom-directed physical examination may be performed at any other visit, when necessary.
f. ECG will be measured only in the intensive PK portion of both parts, prior to any blood collection procedures, excluding subj ects in Japan.
g. A positive urine pregnancy test requires a confirmatory serum test.  (Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 [Pregnancy Test] for additional details.)  Females who are experiencing menses 
or are nearing sexual maturation in the opinion of the PI or who are of childbearing potential should have urine pregnancy test ing done through Post-Treatment Week 4.  
Females of non-childbearing potential (as defined per protocol Inclusion Criteria 3) at Screening do not require pregnancy test ing.

h. For non-cirrhotic subjects:  Coagulation panel performed only at Day 1, at EOT/premature D/C, and as clinically indicated. 
For cirrhotic subjects:  Coagulation panel is required at all treatment visits, including the EOT/premature D/C visit.
i. FSH for all female subjects aged 9 to < 18 years old.
j. Subjects with no history of cirrhosis who have not had a liver biopsy within 24 months prior to screening, or Fibroscan withi n 6 months prior to screening will have a 
screening FibroTest and APRI to determine the presence or absence of cirrhosis for the purpose of treatment assignment.  Subjec ts who have a liver biopsy or FibroScan 
indicating cirrhosis at any time in the past will not need a Fibrotest and APRI to be performed at screening as evidence of cir rhosis.
k. Perform a Fibrotest and APRI at Day 1 for any subject who did not have a FibroTest and APRI done during Screening.l. Applies only to subjects with cirrhosis.  The Child-Pugh score will be calculated in the EDC RAVE system.  Subjects who were considered to be non-cirrhotic at the 
Screening visit but identified as cirrhotic (according to definitions listed in Section 5.3.1.1 ) during the screening period will return to the site prior to the baseline visit for 
Child-Pugh assessment.
m. HCC assessment for subjects with compensated cirrhosis only:  Liver ultrasound will be performed at the screening visit.  Sub jects with a historical negative liver ultrasound, 
CT or MRI (within 3 months prior to screening) are not required to undergo a screening ultrasound.
n. See specific information regarding the adverse event collection in Section 6.1.1.1 .
o. Study drugs are dispensed at Week 8 for subjects on 12 weeks of treatment and at Weeks 8 and 12 for subjects on 16 weeks of t reatment.
p. Dosing card is filled out with date and time (to the nearest minutes) of the 2 doses before PK draws in Part 1 and Part 2.  D osing cards should not be dispensed at Weeks 8 or 
12 if those are EOT visits for the subject (Section 5.3.1.1 ).
q. Intensive PK sampling will be done at Week 2 for the first approximately 12 subjects in each of the age groups and subjects i n Japan participating in J-IPK (Section 5.3.2.1 ).  
Intensive PK samples will be collected at Week 2 visit at time points zero (0) and after two (2), four (4), six (6) and twelve (12) hours of drug intake.  For subjects in Japan 
who will not participate in the J-IPK schedule, samples will be collected at Week 2 visit at time points zero (0) and after two  (2) and four (4) hours of drug intake.
r. Only applicable for HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subject.
s. The Subject will retain the subject number throughout the course of the study.t. Resistance sample will be collected at Day 1.  For a subject who meets virologic failure criteria, a resistance sample must b e drawn at the confirmatory visit.  If HCV RNA is 
< 1000 IU/mL in the sample collected at the confirmatory visit, another resistance sample will be collected in the following vi sit to ensure the HCV RNA is ≥ 1000 IU/mL.
u. The PRO should be administered as the first study procedure.
v. Only subjects in Part 2 will complete the palatability questionnaire, at Week 2 and EOT or premature discontinuation visit. 
w. Dispense HIV-1 Medication Card at screening, if applicable.

Section 3.0  Introduction
Subsection GLE/PIB Dose Selection Strategy for the Pediatric Population
Previously read:
AbbVie's pediatric formulation development strategy is to develop a dosage form that 
provides suitable and flexible dosing across the pediatric age range of 3 to < 18 years.  
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-123 Protocol Amendment 3
EudraCT 2016-004102-34

Development of a suitable pediatric formulation was guided by considerations of 
solubility, dose flexibility, stability, compatibility, and ease and reliability of the manufacturing process.  It is likely the adult tablets will be suitable for adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with weights ≥ 45 kg.  This population is able to swallow tablets 
and utilizing the adult tablet would enable earlier enrollment of this population.
GLE and PIB exhibit low aqueous solubility.  Due to probable requirement of solvent(s) 
that are undesirable for pediatric patients for any oral solution, and  
, AbbVie developed a pediatric 
formulation based on the solid oral formulations used to manufacture the adult tablets.  
Current dose selection strategy for the purposes of this protocol is based on BSA 
normalization and age appropriate scaling.  The objective was to select a dose for each age group in mg that provides exposures in the target range shown to be safe and efficacious in adults based on the formulation available currently.  Clinical trial simulations have been performed to assist in dose selection in the pediatric population.  From the clinical trial simulations performed at the proposed GLE and PIB doses in the pediatric population, summary statistics for each age group for GLE and PIB and the percent of subjects with exposures ≤ 0.5× and ≥  2× the target AUC were estimated and 
are shown in Table 5.

At the doses listed in Table 5, the geometric mean and median exposures are comparable 
within each age group for GLE and PIB.  The variability in each age group is expected to be similar to the variability observed in adults.
The doses shown in Table 5 are based on currently available clearance data in adult 
subjects with HCV infection in Phase 2 studies.

and utilizing the adult tablet would enable earlier enrollment of this population. In Part 1 
of Study M16-123, a total of 47 adolescent subjects received daily administration of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg. PK results showed that the exposures of GLE and PIB in HCV-infected adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age) were similar to the exposures observed in HCV-infected adult subjects following administration of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg.
GLE and PIB exhibit low aqueous solubility.  Due to probable requirement of solvent(s) 
that are undesirable for pediatric patients for any oral solution, and  
 AbbVie developed a pediatric 
formulation based on the solid oral formulations used to manufacture the adult tablets.  
To provide exposures in pediatric subjects comparable to adult exposures using the pediatric formulation, the GLE and PIB dose in pediatric patients of 3 to < 12 years of agewere revised from originally proposed doses.  Preliminary PK results from the initial proposed pediatric doses demonstrated that though GLE and PIB exposures were within the range of exposure for efficacy and safety in adults for each of the pediatric cohorts, the average exposures in each of the cohorts were lower than the targeted AUC and led to a dose adjustment. Additional subjects were enrolled and the intensive PK results obtained, and additional population PK modeling performed, confirming that the adjusted doses demonstrate exposures that would allow for bridging of adult data, using a 50/20 mg dose 
ratio.  These doses ( Table 11 ) are proposed to be used in the subjects enrolling in the non-

observed in HCV-infected adult subjects, close to the targeted AUC.

Protocol Number : VZU0002 5 
Study Phase : Phase 2 
Study Endpoints:  
  The Primary Efficacy endpoint of this study will be to examine the 
extent of reduction in the WOMAC pain  score, relative to baseline, 
provided by once daily, one -hour application of Vehicle 
(CGS-200-0), CGS-200-1, and CGS-200-5 at the following 
assessment times:  
 
Baseline: < 30 minutes prior to first daily application  
Day 35  31 Days (+/ - 3 days) after fourth daily application  
 
and based thereon to determine whether the responses for treatment 
with CGS -200-1 and CGS-200-05 are significantly different from 
Vehicle (CGS-200-0) and from each other at the primary endpoint 
time.  
 
The Primary Safety  endpoints  will be: 
 
(1) The application of the study drug does not produce skin 
reactions (erythema, scaling, pruritus, or other) to a degree 
that is clinically of concern. Scoring of eryth ema and scaling 
at the application sites and of pruritus will be assessed per the 
scoring systems in  Appendix F. 
 
(2) No SAE’s either possibly, probably, or definitely associated 
with study treatments.  
 
(3) Safety labs (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis ) do 
not produce other than minimal – mild toxicities (Grade 1 or 
Grade 2). Scoring of clinical, hematological and urinalysis out 
of range fin dings for toxicity grading will be per  Appendix B.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 4  Secondary Efficacy endpoints will be: 
 
(1) To examine the extent of reduction in the WOMAC pain  score, 
relative to baseline, provided by once daily, one -hour 
application of Vehicle (CGS -200-0), CGS-200-1 and 
CGS-200-5 at the following assessment times:  
 
Baseline: < 30 minutes prior to first daily application  
Day 5   24 hrs (+/- 3) after last of the 4 daily applications  
Day 19  15 days (+/ - 3) after last of the 4 daily applications  
Day 64  60 days (+/ - 3) after the last of 4 daily applications  
Day 94  90 days (+/ - 3) after the last of 4 daily applications  
 
(2) Day 5, 19, 35, 64, and 94 W OMAC scores on the stiffness and 
function subscales as well as total WOMAC score  (including 
the WOMAC pain score).  
 
 
Secondary Safety  endpoints will be:  
 
(1) The distribution by study arms of specific Adverse Events  
(AEs) (e.g ., local application site reactions, and other AEs 
(inclusive of findings for hematology and serum chemistry )).  
(2) Evaluate the amount of concomitant pain medications used 
overtime 
 
Tolerability  endpoints (which are secondary in nature) will be:  
 
(1) The application of study drug does not produce burning -
stinging pain (“BSP”) at the application site to a degree that is 
not acceptable to the subject. BSP at the application site, this 
will be assessed using a 0 – 10 NRS sca le without guideposts. 
“Acceptability” of BSP will be queried per subject at the end 
of each application period.  
 
(2) The application of the study drug does not produce pruritus 
during application or in the 24 hrs post -application to a degree 
that is not accep table to the subject or, if bothersome to the 
subject, cannot be managed by application of ice or a cold pack 
or compress

STUDY SYNOPSIS  (continued)  
FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 5 Study Duration  13-14 weeks for each subject, excluding screening.  
Study Design:  This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind clinical trial in subjects 
with OA according to the 1986 American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) criteria. There will be with three study arms:  
 
Arm 1  CGS-200-0 (Investigational Drug Product Vehicle)  
Arm 2  CGS-200-1 (1% Capsaicin in CGS -200 vehicle)  
Arm 3  CGS-200-5 (5% Capsaicin in CGS -200 vehicle)  
 
Each Arm will enroll 40 evaluable subjects, for a total of 120 evaluable 
subjects in this study. Subjects that give Informed Consent to participate 
and who are deemed after screening to be eligible to participate will be 
randomized to one of the three study Arms.  
 
Subjects will receive the Arm -appropriate treatment as a topical 
application over the frontal aspect of the knee(s)  once daily on four 
consecutive days. The applications will be at the clinic but by the 
subject under supervision of clinic personnel. Wearing gloves 
supplied by the clinic staff, the subject will apply the study drug on 
and around the knee covering a 10cm by 10cm area. The application 
will be left in place for 60  (up to 65) minutes and then washed off at 
the clinic by clinic personnel.  The amount of Investigational Drug 
Product to be applied is estimated to be approximately 0.13 mL based 
on experience in prior studies. Even though both knee(s) will receive 
application of study test materials, with regard to reduction in 
WOMAC pain and VAS pain score associated with study treatments, 
only one knee will be indicated as the “Study Knee”. This will be the 
knee with the highest WOMAC pain score at baseline. If both knees 
have equal WOMAC pain scores at baseline, then the right knee will 
be considered the “Study Knee” with regard to WOMAC pain and 
VAS pain score reduction.   
 
The Investigators, all site staff, study subjects and Clinical Research 
Organization (CRO) personnel (except for the Medical Monitor 
providing safety oversight) directly involved in the study will remain 
blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the trial.  
 
Estimated No. of 
Subjects:  Total 120 evaluable subjects : 40 subjects will be allocated to each 
study Arm. An allowance of up to 10 subjects per Arm is to be 
provided for dropouts whose withdrawal is not due to lack of study 
drug tolerability).

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 18 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
The prevalence of arthritis in the general population is 21% overall, or approximately 
46.4 million adults in the United States (U.S.) .[1] Most of individuals are likely to have 
osteoarthritis (OA),  which is a very common disease.  It is the third most common 
diagnosis made by primary care physicians in older patients and is the most common 
condition involving the knee.  Significant knee pain affects about one quarter of the 
population that are 55 or o lder, and half of these individuals have radiographic evidence 
of OA and a quarter have some degree of disability.  The risk of developing OA is 
related to advancing age, female sex, obesity, trauma, a family history and other factors.  
In 1986, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published classificat ion 
criteria for OA of the knee.[2] Classification criteria are not diagnostic criteria, although 
they are often used as such by clinicians.  The criteria are useful in clinical re search, 
including clinical trials, to provide a uniform population for study.  The classification 
criteria are shown in the table below.

ESR = Erythrocyte sedimentation rate; RF = rheumatoid factor; Synovial fluid (SF) signs of OA are clear, viscous 
fluid or SF white blood  cell count <2,000/mm3 
The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has developed guidelines for the 
diagnosis of OA.[3] During the development of the guidelines, they found that 3 
symptoms (persistent knee pain, morning stiffness, and decreased function) and 3 signs 
(crepitus, restricted movement, and bony enlargement) were most important in the 
diagnosis.  The more symptoms and signs, the more certain is the diagnosis.  While 
diagnostic guidelines are useful in patient care, it will be necessary to use classification 
criteria in this clinical trial.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 19 The pathogenesis of OA remains unclear; however, certain types of OA show familial 
aggregation, and excessive load on joints may play a role.  In addition, over the years, 
there has been some consideration as to whether OA involves inflammation and 
whether it is a primary driver of the development of OA or whethe r trauma or other 
factors produce damage that results in secondary inflammation.  
Whatever the pathogenetic mechanisms may be, OA is a progressive disorder that 
results in disability.  There is a great unmet medical need for more effective treatments 
for OA. Better treatment of the pain of OA has the potential for postponing disability 
and improving health -related quality of life  
Current standard of care for OA may include non -pharmacologic interventions such as 
exercise, weight loss, appropriate insoles, wal king aids, patellar taping in a medial 
direction, thermal treatments, tai chi, psychosocial interventions and self -management 
programs .[4] Pharmacologic agents that can be used include acetaminophen, non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAID) given orally or t opically, tramadol, 
duloxetine, and intra -articular hyaluronate, corticosteroids, or injections.  In addition, 
opioids may be considered in those who respond inadequately to initial interventions.  
In patients who have failed medical therapy or are not willi ng to undergo surgery, or 
for whom joint replacement surgery is contraindicated, opioid therapy is strongly 
recommended.  
Acetaminophen carries a risk of liver damage.  The use of oral NSAIDs is associated 
with a potential for gastric and intestinal ulcerat ion and high doses of NSAIDs have 
been associated with an elevated risk of cardiac problems.  The intent of topical 
NSAIDs is to reduce the systemic levels of these drugs (thereby lowering the risk of 
gastro-intestinal damage) while providing for a therapeu tically effective level in and 
around the affected area.  However, these products – whether oral or topical – require 
regular daily use and administration more than once daily.  The use of any opiate -
containing product poses a risk for addiction or diversion .  
There is therefore considerable unmet medical need for a treatment of OA knee pain 
(OAKP) that does not require regular daily use, does not carry the gastro -intestinal risks 
of NSAIDs or the liver risks of acetaminophen or the addiction / diversion risk s of 
opiates, and can safely provide long lasting pain relief after a brief course of treatment.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 21 VZU00023 (in the DR) was approximately twice what was seen in VZU00022 (in the 
U.S.). 
This marked difference between the response to  placebo (vehicle), using the same 
vehicle, in the U.S. study compared to the  non-U.S. study, conducted in the Dominican 
Republic, appears to  be consistent with the  known higher rates of placebo  response in 
studies conducted in Latin American countries[5], and which effect is within the well -
known influence of cultural differences in placebo respons es [6]. The differences 
between placebo responses in the same studies conducted in Latin America and Europe 
and the corresponding differences for active treatment response are tabulated below 
(Table 1–1). The data in Table 1 suggest that on average, the placebo response in a 
study conducted in a Latin American culture country (such as the Dominican Republic) 
will be circa 2.6 times greater t han in the same study conducted in European countries. 
This, by extension, suggests that the placebo response in a Latin American study may 
be similarly higher compared to the same study conducted in the U.S., the U.S. culture 
being typically more European  than Latin American.  Per Figure 1–3 once daily 
application of vehicle reduced group mean OA pain score to 60% of baseline by Day 
28 in the U.S. OTC study whereas the  vehicle reduced group mean OA pain score to 
25% of baseline by Day 33 in the Dominican Republic study. Looking at these percent 
of baseline values in a different light, the absolute reduction  of OA pain score 
associated with vehicle treatment was 40% for the U.S. study and 75% for the 
Dominican Republic study. The “absolute reduction” is 100% less the percentage of 
baseline at the assessment time (i.e., the degree of pain relief associated with a 
treatment). So, the placebo (vehicle) effect in the Dominica n Republic study appears 
to be 1.9-times greater than the vehicle effect in the U.S. study. This is well within the 
range of differences reported by Xu et al. (2016).[5]

It can be seen, also, from Table 1–1 that the difference in active treatment response in 
Latin America conducted studies and European conducted studies is slight.  One can 
speculate that the large differences noted for placebo re sponses and the small 
differences noted for active treatment responses may be due to a cultural difference in 
the expectations of Latin American subjects compared European subjects. The Latin 
American may tend to believe more strongly that what the doctor or clinic is doing will 
help them, ergo the high placebo responses in Latin America; whereas, the European 
subjects may have lower expectations of obtaining relief, and a lower placebo response 
as a result. For active treatment, if the study treatment is a ctually beneficial, then the 
responses of European subjects and Latin American subjects would be similar, as is 
reported by Xu et al. (2016).[5] The role of cultural differences in expectations regarding 
treatment outcomes is well recognized and has been addressed by Bhugra and 
Ventriglio (2015).[6] 
In contrast to the magnitude of cultural effects on placebo response, the data presented 
by Xu et al. ( 2016) suggest t hat cultural differences in response to active treatment 
appear to be slight . [5] This suggests, in turn, that the pain relief efficacy data for active 
treatment (C GS-200-5) in study VZU00023 will hold up in the U.S. study planned 
under this protocol. Conversely, the large cultural differences in placebo responses, 
along with experience with vehicle response in a U.S. OTC product study, suggest that 
the vehicle response in the clinical study planned under this Investigational New Drug 
(IND) application will be much lower than was observed in study VZU00023 and likely 
similar to what was seen in the U. S. OTC product study.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 23 1.2 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY SUMMARY  
Sponsor has conducted a number of non -clinical toxicology studies  with high strength 
Capsaicin topical liquid. These studies  have, for the most part, been conducted with a 
different formulation of high strength topical capsaicin  than that which will be 
investigated under Protocol VZU00025 . This alternate formulation is termed CGS -125 
and contains  additional OTC Monograph topical analgesic agents. Table 1–2 below 
shows the difference between CGS -125 with 5% Capsaicin and CGS -200-5.  
Table 1–2. Comparison of CGS -125-5 and CGS -200-5 Composition

Methyl Salicylate  50%  
Menthol 15%  
Camphor 11%  
Phenol 1.50%  
Dehydrated Alcohol  17.5%  
 
The CGS -125 formulation contains a number of OTC Monograph topical analgesics. 
These are known to have pharmacological activity and present the potential that the 
CGS-125 formulation could have more potential for toxicities than CGS -200, which 
contains non e of these ingredients.  
Both formulations contain similar levels of dehydrated alcohol (i.e., ethanol), so they 
are comparable in this regard, CGS -200 has, otherwise, only one compound that has 
known pharmacological activity (capsaicin) and it is at the same level as in CGS -125-5. 
The excipients in CGS -200 are all of low toxicity potential.

1.3 PREVIOUS CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
Study VZU00020  
This was a clinical study comparing the single dose tolerability of 5% and 10% 
capsaicin in CGS -125 and in CGS -200 (VZU00020) demonstrated that CGS -200 with 
5% and 10% capsaicin produced a mean burning - stinging pain (“BSP”) score of not 
more than 2.5 on a  0 – 10 NRS scale. In this same study the number of subjects 
reporting an NRS BSP score of 5 or greater (on the 0 – 10 scale) is as tabulated in  
Table 1–3 below:

Study VZU00021  
This was a study in which CGS -125 formulation of 5% and 10% capsaicin and CGS -
200 formulations of 5% and 10% were applied once daily for 1 hour on each of four 
sequential days to subjects with confirmed knee OA and a baseline NRS OA knee pain 
score of 5 or greater.  OA knee pain was assessed daily on Days 1 ( before the first 
application) and then on Days 2, 3 and 4 (prior to the daily application) and again on 
Days 5, 19 and 33. Burning -stinging pain at the applic ation site was evaluated on a 
0 – 10 NRS scale. Erythema, scaling and pruritus were also assessed and scored at each 
protocol assessment time.  
In VZU00021, both CGS -200-05 and CGS -200-10 gave a high level of pain control 
with 85% or greater of subjects ex periencing a reduction from baseline NRS of 50% or

Both formulations at either strength were well tolerated and reduced OAKP by 
75% or more compared to baseline. Analgesic effect persisted to Day 33 (last 
follow up day). No serious adverse events ( SAEs), no adverse events ( AEs) 
resulting in subject discontinuation or subject requested withdrawal, only AEs that 
were possibly, probably or definitely treatment related were: (a) local at the 
application site and Rheumatology Common Toxicity Criteria ( RCTC) toxicity 
grades were generally 1 (mild) and at highest 2 (moderate) and were mostly BSP 
with less frequent erythema, pruritus, and scaling (latter only for CGS -125-10); and 
(b) coughing / sneezing during or following application (RCTC Grade 1, mild) 
which was observed in a higher proportion of CGS -125 subjects (40% - 60%) than 
in CGS-200 subjects (20% - 27%). Comparison of Day 33 (study exit) values for 
serum chemistry and hematology with values at screening showed no remarkable 
changes in any subjects and no differences for any subject, comparing Day 33 to 
Screening, that were atypical of the normal variations in serum chemistry and 
hematology values in individuals for blood sampling at different time points. In 
summary, no suggestion of systemic toxicitie s related to treatment was observed.  
In Study VZU00021 neither vehicle or a true placebo was used as the study was 
designed to compare the CGS -200 formulation with the CGS -125 formulation in terms 
of tolerability and efficacy for a 4 -day, once daily for 1-hour treatment regimen.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 29 Study VZU00023  
This was a vehicle -controlled study of safety, tolerability and efficacy of CGS -200 
5% capsacian  in subjects with OA of the knee. Single daily application for four 
consecutive days with 93 days (13 weeks) follow up.  
CGS-200-5 was well tolerated and reduced OAKP at 13 weeks by 93% compared 
to baseline. No SAEs, no AEs resulting in subject discontinuation or subject 
requested withdrawal, only AEs that were possibly, probably or definitely 
treatment related were: (a) loc al at the application site and RCTC toxicity grades 
were generally 1 (mild) and at highest 2 (moderate) and were mostly BSP (in 100% 
of subjects) with less frequent erythema (72% of subjects), and pruritus (56% or 
subjects) ; and (b) coughing / sneezing du ring or following application (RCTC 
Grade 1, mild) which was observed in 20% of subjects. No suggestion of systemic 
toxicities related to treatment was observed.  
In this study, Vehicle control had an unexpectedly high placebo effect, with 
reduction of OAKP s cores by around 83% at 13 weeks. Unusually high placebo 
effects are known from  the literature to occur in studies in Latin American 
countries such as the Dominican Republic.[5] No SAEs, no AEs resulting on subject 
discontinuation or subject requested withdrawal, only AEs that were possibly, 
probably or definitely treatment related were: (a) local at the application site and 
RCTC toxicity grades were generally 1 (mild) and at highest 2 (moderate) and were 
mostly BSP (in 35% of subjects) with less frequent erythema (15% of subjects), 
and pruritus (31% or subjects) ; and (b) coughing / sneezing during or following 
application (RCTC  Grade 1, mild) which was observed in 3.8% of subjects. In this 
study, serum chemistries, hematology and urinalysis data were collected at 
screening but not at a later time point. However, as a reference point, no remarkable 
differences for serum chemistry  and hematology were observed between screening 
values and vales at one month after study start in Study VZU00021. It was, 
therefore, concluded that in Study VZU00023 no remarkable differences in serum 
chemistry and hematology values between screening and one to three months after 
study start would be observed. No suggestion of systemic toxicities related to 
treatment was observed in Study VZU00023.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 31 It can be noted that for the NRS pa in scores ( Figure 1–1) the difference between 
placebo (vehicle) response and active treatment response is less than the difference 
between placebo (vehicle) response and active treatment response as assessed by the 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) pain 
subscale. Additionally, the placebo (vehicle) response is higher than expected based on 
data from a U.S. clinical study of Sponsor’s OTC Tentative Final Monograph ( TFM) 
capsaicin product (0.025% capsaicin topical liquid).  The placebo response in that study 
was in the range of only a  60% reduction in OA knee pain scores relative to baseline 
(using a 100 mm VAS scale for pain assessment).  This is illustrated in  Figure 1–3, next 
page, which superimposes the U.S. vehicle response data onto the VZU00023 response 
data through Day 33.  In the U.S. OTC study the final assessment time was at Day 28 
and the vehicle was applied daily for 7 consecutive days either once daily or twice daily 
(with an application interval time of approximately 12 hrs). The vehicle re sponse data 
shown in Figure 1–3 are for the once daily application of vehicle so as to be comparable 
to the once daily application of vehicle in study VZU00023.  In the U.S. study, twice 
daily application of vehicle pr oduced an approximately 55% reduction of group mean 
pain score relative to baseline.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 32 This marked difference between the response to  placebo (vehicle), using the same 
vehicle, in the U.S. study compared to the  non-U.S. study, conducted in the Dominican 
Republic, appears to  be consistent with the  known higher rates of placebo  response in 
studies conducted in Latin American c ountries [5], and which effect is within the well -
known influence of cultural differences in placebo responses .[6] The differenc es 
between placebo responses in the same studies conducted in Latin America and  Europe 
and the corresponding differences for active treatment response reported in Xu et al. 
(2016) suggest that on average, the placebo response in a study conducted in a Lati n 
American culture country (such as the Dominican Republic) will be circa 2.6 times 
greater than in the same study conducted in European countries.  [5] This, by extension, 
suggests that the placebo response in a Latin American study may be similarly higher 
compared to the same study conducted in the U.S., the U.S. culture being typically 
more European than Latin American.  Per Figure 1–3 once daily application of vehicle 
reduced group mean OA pain score to 60% of baseline by Day 28 in the U.S. OTC 
study whereas the vehicle reduced group mean OA pain score to 25% of baseline by 
Day 33 in the Dominican Republic study. Looking at t hese percent of baseline values 
in a different light, the absolute reduction  of OA pain score associated with vehicle 
treatment was 40% for the U.S. study and 75% for the Dominican Republic study. The 
“absolute reduction” is 100% less the percentage of b aseline at the assessment time 
(i.e., the degree of pain relief associated with a treatment). So, the placebo (vehicle) 
effect in the Dominican Republic study appears to be 1.9 -times greater than the vehicle 
effect in the U.S. study. This is  well within the range of differences reported by Xu et 
al. (2016).[5] 
1.4 SUMMARY OF SAFETY DATA  
There have been three clinical trials conducted with CGS -200-5 and CGS -200-10 
(VZU00020, VZU00021 , and VZU00023). Thes e have been conducted in the 
Dominican Republic with regulatory approval by CONABIOS and the local IRBs 
(Ethics Committees) for the study centers.  With respect to the investigational drug 
product vehicle (CGS -200-0): One trial has been conducted in the Dom inican Republic 
(VZU00023) and one trial was conducted in the U.S. (VZU00022). The U.S. study was 
for Sponsor’s OTC TFM product that contains 0.25% capsaicin in CGS -200 vehicle.

Hematology and serum chemist ries were assessed for subjects in Study VZU00021 at 
screening and then again at Day 33 (last study assessment day and planned exit day). 
These are not tabulated here as for very study subject there were no remarkable changes 
or differences which were outs ide what is typical for hematology and serum chemistry 
assessments taken on the same person but at different times.  
The amounts of capsaicin to be applied in this study and the likely systemic uptake of 
capsaicin by subjects in this study are quite small and further support that the topical 
applications of capsaicin to the subject’s knees in the planned study will be safe for the 
subjects. For the initial investigation planned under this IND capsaicin will be applied 
in two strengths: 1% capsaicin (CGS -200-1) and 5% capsaicin (CGS -200-5). Also, the 
vehicle will be applied as a placebo control. The ingredients in CGS -200-1 and 
CGS-200-5 are as indicted in the tables that follow .

of CGS-200 applied per application is approximately 0.30 gram and this is applied to 
an area of approximately 200 cm2 (ca. 100 cm2 per knee).  Note that both knees will 
receive study drug application but only one knee will be the study knee on which

These are all trivially small amounts for each of the components by the topical route.  
For the capsaicin, the total maximum amount applied, 15 mg, would be a topical dosage 
of 0.21 mg/kg for a 70 kg person. As an application per cm2 of surface area it wou ld be 
0.075 mg/cm2.  
One can compare the above 0.075 mg/cm2 (75 µg/cm2) with published data on 
capsaicin uptake from the 8% Qutenza patch (Babbar et al., 2009 [full copy in the 
Literature Appendix to Module 2]).[7] Babbar et al. (2009) report that areas of 
1,000 cm2 were treated with patches containing capsaicin at 640 µg capsaicin/cm2. 
Treatment durat ion was generally for 60 minutes (same as intended for the protocol 
under this present IND) but in some cases, was for up to 90 minutes.  The total amount

Babbar et al. (2009) reported that the lower limit of quantification ( LLOQ) for their 
serum capsaicin assay was 0.5 ng/mL, which can be considered a sensitive high-
performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) method.[7] They also report that the 
percentage of subje cts that had serum levels below the LLOQ was, in four different 
studies, respectively: 89%, 99%, 99.5% , and 94%. The median serum C max for all 
subjects in all studies was reported to be circa 2 ng/mL with a time to maximum effect 
(Tmax) of circa 1.5 hrs and with serum levels dropping to below LLOQ for all subjects 
by 4 – 5 hrs after patch removal.  
Given that the unit surface area application rate for capsaicin in Protocol VZU00025 
will be only about 12% of that used in the studies repor ted by Babbar et al., (2009) it 
suggests that there would be no subjects in Protocol VZU00025 who would have 
capsaicin serum levels above an LLOQ of 0.5 ng/mL.[7]  
In Non-Clinical studie s (summarized above), no suggestions of potential systemic or 
site of application toxicities have bee n reported.  
1.4.1 Possible Risks  
All safety data obtained in this trial will be carefully evaluated and used to inform the 
design of any future clinical trials.  The potential risks of study participation include 
those associated with exposure to capsaicin and possible allergic reactions to capsaicin 
or one of the other components of the investigational products.  Effects of topical 
exposure to capsaicin include er ythema, edema, papules, scaling, pruritus, stinging and 
burning pain.  These manifestations may also occur in unintended locations through 
transfer of the investigational products from the treatment area to other sites on the 
skin, mucous membranes, and ocu lar surfaces. Inhalation of fumes or aerosolization of 
the investigational products may cause irritation of airways with symptoms such as 
coughing.  A temporary rise in blood pressure (hypertension) or difficulty sleeping 
could occur if pain from stinging a nd burning is severe.  All subjects will receive a full 
explanation of potential risks and will sign an informed consent form prior to study 
participation.

The objectives of the present study are the following:  
• To develop pain relief dose -response data for OAKP, compared to Vehicle, for 
the following concentrations of Capsaicin in CGS -200 vehicle: 1% and 5% using 
the WOMAC pa in subscale (VAS formatted) as the primary pain index for relief 
of OAKP.   
• To confirm, in a U.S. based po pulation, the high safety profile for CGS -200-5 
that was reported in Studies VZU00021 and VZU00023 in a Dominican Republic 
population.  
• To develop data for relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis using the 
WOMAC subscales for pain, stiffness and function and total WOMAC score.  
• To develop OAKP relief data using the 100 mm VAS scale.  
2.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINTS  
The Primary Efficacy endpoint of this study will be to examine the extent of reduction 
in the WOMAC pain  score, relative to baseline, provided by once  daily, one -hour 
application of Vehicle (CGS-200-0), CGS-200-1 and CGS -200-5 at the following 
assessment times:  
Baseline: < 30 minutes prior to first daily application  
Day 35  31 Days (+/- 3 days) after fourth daily application  
and based thereon to determi ne whether the responses for treatm ent with CGS -200-0, 
CGS-200-1, and CGS-200-05 are significantly different from Vehicle and from each 
other at the primary endpoint t ime.  
The Primary Safety  Endpoints  will be: 
(1) The application  of the study drug does not produce skin reactions (erythema, 
scaling, pruritus, or other) to a degree that is clinically of concern. Scoring of

3.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind clinical trial to examine the 
comparative effects on OAKP of CGS-200-1 (1% C apsaicin content) (N= 40), 
CGS-200-5 (5% Capsaicin content) (N= 40), and CGS-200 Vehicle  (no Capsaicin ) 
(N=40) in subjects with OA of the knees according to the 1986 ACR criteria. Assigned 
doses will be applied at the clinic for 60 minutes on each of four co nsecutive days.  
Subjects will be randomized to one of the three Arms in this study: CGS-200-1 or 
CGS-200-5 or CGS-200-0 (Vehicle). All subjects will receive 4 consecutive days of 
treatment and will then be followed up until the Day 94 visit. 
Subjects will receive the study arm appropriate treatment as a topical application over 
the frontal aspect of the knee(s)  once daily on four consecutive days. The applications 
will be at the clinic but by the subject wearing gloves  under supervision of clinic 
personnel. The application will be left in place for 60 minutes and then washed off at 
the clinic by clinic personnel.  The amount of Investigational Drug Product to be applied 
is estimated to be approximately 0.13 mL based on experience in prior studies. E ven 
though both knee(s) will receive application of study test materials, with regard to 
reduction in  WOMAC pain and  VAS pain score associated with study treatments, only 
one knee will be indicated as the “Study Knee”. This will be the knee with the highe st  
WOMAC pain score at baseline. If both knees have equal WOMAC pain scores at 
baseline, then the right knee will be considered the “Study Knee” with regard to 
WOMAC pain and VAS pain score reduction.  
Data will be collected from Day 1 through Day 5 and t hen again on Days 19, 35, 64, 
and 94 for  efficacy, tolerability, and safety measures.  The Investigators, all site staff 
and Clinical Research Organization (CRO) personnel (except the Medical Monitor 
providing safety oversight) directly involved in the stud y will remain blinded to the 
treatment assignment throughout the trial.   
3.2 DOSE LIMITING TOXICITY  
AEs and SAEs will be assessed according to the Rheumatology Common Toxicity 
Criteria (RCTC) v2.0[8] (Appendix B).

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 40 Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) stopping rules for the study drug are based mainly on 
Grade 2 events related to the study drug, with the following exceptions:  
1. Cutaneous CGS-200-1 (Capsaicin 1%  Topical Liquid) and CGS-200-5 (Capsaicin 
5% Topical Liquid)  have the potential for being associated with Grade 2 
administration site reactions such as erythema, pain and edema, and the DLT 
threshold has been set at Grade 3.  
2. The cut-point of Grade 3 to de fine a DLT and stop further administration of study 
drug was selected for the safety of subjects since the RCTC only require permanent 
discontinuation of drugs that attain a Grade 4.  
A DLT will be defined as any toxicity occurring within 14 days of treatme nt with the 
investigational product, and meeting the following criteria:  
• > Grade 3 AE including:  
− Allergic / Immunologic: immune reactions, rhinitis;  
− Cardiac: hypertension, hypotension;  
− Dermatologic: reaction at site of study drug administration;  
− Neuropsychiatric: inability to concentrate, insomnia (in absence of pain), 
peripheral sensory neuropathy.  
• Any other ≥ Grade 2 AE (excluding AEs captured above and pre -existing OA -
related conditions) .

• Name of manufacturer  
• Name of sponsor  
Study drug inventory/accountability forms will be monitored during the study and 
reconciled by the study monitor at the end of the study.  All used and unused 
investigational study drug must be accounted for on a study drug accountability form 
provided to the investigator by the site monitor.  
5.1.3 Rationale for Dose Selection  
In a previous clinical investigation with CGS -200 5% and 10% capsaicin 
(Study VZU00021), both strengths gave essentially the same degree of pain relief and 
over essentially the same time course to maximum effect and lasting at least 29 days 
after cessation of t reatment. Both strengths were well tolerated. Based on this, the 
choice of CGS -200-05 as the high dose Arm in this study is seen as rational . For the 
low dose Arm, CGS -200-1 was selected on the basis of being a reduction of 5 -fold 
from the 5% dose, which d egree of reduction is likely to give a lower response than the 
5% dose based on modeling of analgesic responses from 7 days of QD and BID doses

OTC Monograph capsaicin topical  product.  
5.1.4 Dosage and Administration  
The study medication is for external use only and will be administered at the clinic by 
the subject under the supervision of trained site personnel.  Wearing gloves, supplied 
by the clinic staff, a  single dose of the ass igned treatment will be topically applied to 
each knee on each of four dosing days.  Both knees will be treated for all subjects , if 
possible, however only one knee will be the study knee on which assessments are 
performed . The first application  of medicati on will be at Visit 2 on Day 1 (initiated at 
Time 0). Dosing on each of the three subsequent treatment days should be performed 
at the same time of day ±2 hours in relation to the start time of the initial dose on Day  1.  
With the knee relaxed, in a straig ht and horizontal position, treatment will begin by 
identifying a 10 cm by 10 cm area where the upper boundary is 1 cm above the patella, 
the center is aligned with the midline of the patella, and the line bisecting the 10 cm by 
10 cm square has 5 cm on ei ther side medially and laterally to the midline of the patella.  
Each application of the study medication will consist of a single pass of the roller ball 
over the knee so as to completely cover the designated treatment area.  The treatment 
will be applied c ontinuously beginning at the upper left corner of the square and 
moving the rollerball horizontally to the upper right corner and moving back and forth 
in a continuous pattern in a downward progression until the entire square is covered.  
This should result in moistening the skin providing a thin film of medication 
(approximately 0.13 mL [or 0.13 gram] of drug product applied to 100 cm2 of knee 
surface, which represents 1.3 mg of solution per cm2). Areas that were already 
moistened should not be recoat ed. The study medication should not be applied to a knee 
if the subject is still experiencing stinging, burning, pruritus, erythema, or scaling from 
a prior application to that knee.  In the case of a dose that is skipped, the subject should 
return as sched uled for their next visit at which time they may receive the next 
scheduled application of study medication if their symptoms have subsided.  The 
treatment period will not be extended beyond 4 days.  
During the application process, care must be taken not to contaminate the outside of 
the bottle, other body surfaces, or equipment or other surfaces in the room.  Any 
suspected contamination should be dealt with by washing off the formulation as soon 
as possible.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 47 The subject’s knees will remain uncovered for 60  minutes (up to 65 minutes)  after 
dosing to allow for assessments and proper absorption of the study medication.  The 
subject must avoid touching the knee area during this time.  The knees will then be 
cleansed by trained personnel according to specific proc edures designed to remove any 
remaining residual formulation from the surface of the skin.  After the area is cleansed, 
the subject may cover their knees, but should avoid doing so if possible.  It is 
recommended that the subject wear shorts or a skirt durin g the treatment period rather 
than long pants.  During the four days of treatment, subjects should also avoid exposing 
the knees to any form of heat (hot water, vigorous exercise, direct sunlight, etc.).  If a 
subject experiences intolerable pain or severe i rritation from the study medication, they 
may apply cold water, ice, or a cold pack or cold compress to their knee.  If the subject 
continues to have unbearable pain, they should contact the study site for help with pain 
management.  In the event of an aller gic reaction or medical emergency, the Medical 
Monitor must be contacted immediately.  
Treatment assignment for all subjects enrolled in this study will be double -blind; the 
subjects and all site personnel and CRO personnel (except for the medical monitor 
providing safety oversight) involved in this study will not know the treatment given to 
any subject.  Every effort should be made to maintain the study blind.   
Subjects will be monitored closely during and after application of treatment for any 
signs of acut e adverse reactions.  If an allergic reaction occurs, suggested guidelines are 
as follows:  
• Grade 3 or higher adverse reaction:  
− If treatment is ongoing, it must be immediately and permanently 
discontinued , the study drug should be washed off, and the subject  should 
be treated symptomatically as clinically indicated.  
− The subject will be followed for safety as clinically indicated until the 
toxicity resolves, and in the opinion of the investigator, no further follow -
up regarding the toxicity is needed.  Complete  documentation of the event is 
required.

− If treatment is ongoing, it must be immediately interrupted and the subject 
should be treated symptomatically as clinically indicated.  
− Once the subject has recovered to baseline and, if in  the opinion of the 
investigator the benefit/risk is favorable, consideration can be given to 
restarting the treatment the next day after pre -medicating with an 
H2-receptor antagonist and acetaminophen.  
• Grade 1 adverse reaction:  
− If treatment is ongoing, it  may continue, but the subject should continue to 
be monitored carefully to ensure that ongoing signs and symptoms do not 
progress and worsen warranting intervention as described above.

6.7 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL 
TOXICITIES  
6.7.1 Allergic Reaction , Burning, or Pruritus  
In the case of any life -threatening event oc curring during the treatment, the study drug 
must be immediately and permanently discontinued.  While corticosteroids are strongly 
discouraged, they may be used if they are necessary for the safety of the subject.  
• Rash/pruritus/urticaria  
− If subject develops rash, pruritus, or urticaria, interrupt treatment if it is 
ongoing and promptly assess subject for any other associated 
signs/symptoms (e.g., hypotension, fever, respiratory distress).  
• Consider treating with H2 receptor antagonists as clinically i ndicated. 
If rash / pruritus / urticaria is isolated and resolves either 
spontaneously or with intervention, treatment with the study drug may 
be restarted.   
6.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/RESCUE MEDICATIONS  
Subjects may continue their baseline medication(s) as l ong as the medications are not 
among the prohibited medications listed in Section  5.2.2. The daily dose of each 
medication should be maintained thr oughout the study  since any changes to this 
background regimen may have an effect on the assessment.  Subjects are allowed to 
increase dosage of NSAIDs or use analgesics to treat minor pain throughout the study, 
provided all concomitant medications are back  to baseline dosages within 24 hours of 
a clinical assessment visit.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 55 If for any reason deemed necessary by the investigator, such as in the event of a 
substantial disease flare which cannot be treated with increased drugs (NSAIDs) or 
narcotic, a rescue me dication can be initiated at any time that is in the best interests of 
the subject.  Rescue medication should be carefully considered by the principal 
investigator ( PI) since there may be an effect on the results of the study.  All changes 
and start and stop  dates, and the indication for which it was given must be recorded in 
the source documents and eCRF.  Routine changes (dose, route, etc.) to the background 
treatments should not be performed.  
6.9 STOPPING CRITERIA  
6.9.1 Criteria for Adverse Event Assessment  
All AEs w ill be graded according to the RCTC v.2.0 ( Appendix B). Please refer to 
Section 8.0, Safety Assessments  for additional information . 
6.9.2 General Criteria for Stopping Study Drug  
The study drug will be permanently discontinued for an y subject who meets a DLT 
criterion as outlined in Section 3.2.  
6.9.3 Stopping Criteria  
Any ≥ Grade 3 event considered related to the study drug and occu rring during 
administration of the study drug will result in its permanent discontinuation for that 
subject. The Medical Monitor  should be notified immediately and the subject should 
be followed for safety as clinically indicated until the toxicity resolve s and in the 
opinion of the investigator, no further follow -up regarding the toxicity is needed.  
6.10 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS FROM STUDY  
Subjects will be free to withdraw from treatment or from the study at any time for any 
reason, or they may be withdrawn/remov ed, if necessary (see reasons for withdrawal 
below). It is understood by all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can 
render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should 
be avoided.

8.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1.1 Definitions  
The AE mon itoring period begins with the start of study drug administration on Day 1 
and continues through Day 94. 
ADVERSE EVENT EXPERIENCE (AE) – any unfavorable or unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease that is temporally associated with the use of an investigationa l 
drug but is not necessarily caused by the investigational drug.  This includes worsening 
(e.g.; increase in frequency or severity) of pre -existing conditions.  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) – an AE resulting in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening (immediate  risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospitalization  
• Prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically important*  
*Important medical events that may not result in dea th, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in a subject’s 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug ab use. 
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT – any adverse event, the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure (IB).  Expected means 
that the event has previously been observed with the study drug and is identified and/or

Protocol VZU00025   
 
FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 59 described in the current IB.  It does not mean that the event is expected with the 
underlying disease(s) or concomitant medications.  
8.1.2 Reporting to the Sponsor  
All AEs that are identified from the start of study drug  administration and throu gh 
Day 94 will be documented in the source documents and the AE eCRF.  All data fields 
on the AE eCRF should be completed.  
SAE must also be documented on the SAE Worksheet and sent to the sponsor/designee 
within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of an SAE.  The SAE Worksheet 
should be completed as much as possible but should not be held until all information is 
available.  Additional information, follow -up information, and corrections should be 
provided on subsequent SAE Worksheets that are cl early identified as follow -up (#1, 
#2, etc.) reports.  SAE Worksheets should be sent by Email with Telephone Notification 
to the Drug Safety Department at:  
  Telephone #:  1-513-619-4771 
  Email:  CTIsafety@CTIfacts.com    
Drug Safety personnel will be availa ble to answer questions and assist site personnel 
in documenting SAEs and completing the SAE worksheet.  
8.1.3 Investigator Evaluation of Adverse Events  
The determination of seriousness, severity and causality must be made by the physician 
investigator  who is qua lified to review AE information, provide a medical evaluation 
of AEs, and classify AEs based upon medical judgment.  The investigator will evaluate 
all AEs with respect to seriousness (criteria listed above), severity, and causality 
(relationship to study d rug) according to the guidelines listed below.   
Severity will be graded using the RCTC, v2.0.  The RCTC is provided in Appendix B. 
In the event that an  AE does not have a RCTC code, the following severity 
classifications will be used:

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 60 SEVERITY  
Grade 1: Mild    Causing no limitation of usual activities  
Grade 2: Moderate   Causing some limitation of usual activities  
Grade 3: Severe   Causing inability to carr y out usual activities  
Grade 4: Life Threatening*  Potentially life threatening or disabling  
* Note – a severity assessment of Life Threatening is not necessarily the same as Life 
Threatening as a “Serious” criteria.  The latter means that the event is an im mediate 
threat to life as opposed to a potential threat to life.  
8.1.3.1 Assessment of Seriousness  
Event seriousness will be determined according to the protoc ol definition of SAE in 
Section 8.1.1. 
8.1.3.2 Assessment of Severity  
Event severity will be assigned according to the RCTC, v2.0.  
8.1.3.3 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is required to provide an assessment of causality or relationship  of 
AEs to the study drug based on 1) temporal relationship of the event to the 
administration of study drug; 2) whether an alternative etiology has been identified; 
and 3) biological plausibility.  The causality assessment categories that will be used for 
this study are described below.  
Note: If a causality assessment is not provided, a possible relationship will be assumed 
for regulatory reporting purposes.

Protocol VZU00025   
 
FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 61 Causality assessments that are considered Not Related  to study drug:  
None: The event is related to an etiology other than the study drug (the alternative 
etiology must be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
Unlikely: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which mak es a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  The event is unlikely to be related to the 
study drug and likely to be related to factors other than study drug.  
Causality assess ments that are considered Related to study drug:  
Possible: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administrations of the drug, but which could also be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or ch emicals. Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Probable:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other dr ugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge).  Rechallenge 
information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
Definite: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administration, and which cannot be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  The response 
to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible.  The 
event must be definitive pharmacologically  or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
Note – ICH guidelines (3/95) clarify “reasonable causal relationship” to mean, 
“that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.”

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 62 8.1.4 Follow-up of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be captured from start of study drug treatment through Day 94. 
AEs are followed until final outcome is known or until the end of the study Day 94. 
AEs that are not resolved as of Day 94 are recorded on the AE  eCRF as ongoing and 
in the outcome field as Not Recovered/Not Resolved.  
SAEs that have not resolved by Day 94 are followed until final outcome is known.  If it 
is not possible to obtain a final outcome for a SAE (e.g., the subject is lost to follow -up), 
the reason a final outcome could not be obtained will be documented by the 
investigator.  
Pregnancy:  
All reports of pregnancy, or partner pregnancy, occurring after treatment with study 
drug and up to Day 94 must be reported via the Pregnancy Report form to S afety as per 
Section 8.1.2. Pregnancy itself is not an AE or SAE.  However, any events arising 
during the pregnancy will be assessed and reported acc ordingly as an AE or SAE.  A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and shall be reported on the 
SAE Worksheet.  Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy 
and considered reasonably related to the investigational pro duct by the investigator will 
be reported to Safety.  All reported pregnancy cases will be followed up until outcome.  
8.1.5 Post Study SAEs  
SAEs that occur after the Day 94 visit that are assessed by the investigator to be 
possibly, probably, or definitely relate d to study drug must be reported to Safety on a 
SAE Worksheet, as described in Section 8.1.2. Post study SAEs will not be documented 
on the AE eCRF.  
8.1.6 Reporting to the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the investigational drug will be 
reported by Vizuri Health Sciences/designee as 15 -Day (Expedited) reports to the 
regulatory au thority AND to all participating investigators.  Each investigator must 
notify the IRB/IEC responsible for reviewing the study at their site of all 15 -Day

9.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
A sample size analysis has  been performed  and suggests that a sample size of 
40 evaluable subjects per each of the three study arms will appropriately power this 
study.  
9.2 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
Treatment assignment for all subjects enrolled in this study will be double -blind; the 
subjects and all site personnel and CRO personnel (with the exception of the Medical 
Monitor providing safety oversight) involved in this study will not know the treatment 
given to any subject.  Every effort should be made to maintain the study blind.   
9.3 ANALYSIS  SETS 
The following three analysis sets will be defined for this study:  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) set will be defined as all randomized subjects, whether or not 
they receive study drug.   
The modified ITT (mITT) set will be defined as the subset of the ITT  subjects that 
receive at least one dose of study medication and have at least one evaluable 
post-dosing efficacy endpoint.  The mITT set will be defined based on randomized 
treatment rather than treatment actually received.  All efficacy analyses will be carried 
out using the mITT set.  
The safety (SAF) set will be based on the ITT subjects, but will be based on the 
treatment actually received rather than randomized treatment.  All safety analyses will 
be carried out using the SAF set.  
9.4 SUBJECT ACCOUNTABILITY  
All subjects who meet the inclusion criteria for the study, sign the informed consent 
form, and are enrolled and exposed to the study medication will be accounted for in the

Subject demographic characteristics including age, gender, race, weight, and height 
will be summarized by treatment group.  Subject baselin e disease characteristics that 
are relevant to the evaluation of the treatment will be summarized by treatment group.  
9.5.2 Treatment Administration/Compliance  
The Investigators will be responsible for the storage, dispensing, inventory, and 
accountability of al l clinical supplies.  An accurate, timely record of the disposition of 
all clinical supplies must be maintained.  Subjects may be withdrawn from the study by 
the Sponsor for non -compliance with the protocol.   
9.5.3 Efficacy Analyses  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The group mean LMS difference between each Active Treatment Arm and the Vehicle 
Arm for the WOMAC pain score at Day 35 will be tested for significance of difference 
at a significance value of p < 0.05.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The group mean LMS difference between each Active Treatment Arm and the Vehicle 
Arm for the WOMAC stiffness, function and total  score at Day 35 will be tested for 
significance of difference at a significance value of p < 0.05 
Also, the group mean reduction in OA knee pain sc ore on a 100 mm VAS scale for 
each active treatment arm will be compared to the vehicle arm and tested for 
significance of difference at a significance value of p < 0.05

Arms for the WOMAC pain, stiffness, function and total  score at Day 35 will be 
tested for significance of difference at a significance value of p < 0.05 
Efficacy analyses will be carried out on the mITT set.  
9.5.3.1 Clinical Response  
Clinical response will be measured by reduction of WOMAC pain score . In order for a 
subject to be considered to have successfully obtained a clinical response, the following 
criteria must be met:  
WOMAC pain  score reduced to 50% or less of baseline at any of the stat ed 
assessment times.  
The durability of clinical response up to Day 94 will be evaluated by a tabulation of 
clinical response at a Day s 19, 35, 64, and the Day 94 visit by treatment group.  Subjects 
who have successfully met the above criteria (reduction of a least 50% in NRS pain 
score) at the Day 5 visit and who remain at least at this reduction of pain score or lower 
at the Day 35 visit will be considered to have a durable clinical response.  Subjects who 
at the Day 3 5 visit have less reduction in WOMAC in OAKP score than they did at the 
Day 5 assessment will be considered to have failed to achieve a durable clinical 
response.  
9.5.3.2 Exploratory Analyses  
Post hoc tests may be performed to test for differences in the eff icacy endpoints 
between the CGS -200-0 (Vehicle), CGS -200-1 and CGS-200-5 treatment groups for 
exploratory purposes.  
9.5.4 Tolerability Analyses  
The primary tolerability endpoint will be tolerability of the formulations on each of 
Days 1, 2, 3, and 4.  On each of these days, subjects will report an N RS score for 
burning / stinging at the application site pre -treatment and during treatment, and a

tolerability variables will be entered as a value at each asses sment time. For each 
subject an “area under the curve” (AUC) calculation will be performed in 90 minute 
intervals for each score value.  The AUC’s for tolerability variables combined will be 
compared between the CGS -200-5 and CGS-200-0 treatment groups.  
9.5.5 Safety Analyses  
9.5.5.1 Adverse Events  
The incidence of all reported AEs and treatment -emergent AEs (TEAE) will be 
tabulated.  A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurs or worsens in intensity after 
the administration of study drug.  AEs will be classified by sys tem organ class and 
preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The 
severity of the AE will be graded using the RCTC v2.0 whenever possible.  For AEs 
that are not included in the RCTC v2.0, the grading categories (mild, m oderate, severe, 
and life-threatening) will be used and equated to the respective RCTC grade (Grades 
1, 2, 3, and 4).  For incidence reporting, if a subject reports more than one AE that is 
coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject  will be counted 
only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term.  
An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of TEAEs, treatment -related 
AEs, severity of AEs, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be 
presented.  For AEs presented by severity, the worst severity during the study will be 
presented for each subject.  The subject incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by 
system organ class and preferred term.  The subject incidence of treatment -related AEs 
and RCTC v2.0 toxicity grade will be summarized by preferred term.  
9.5.6 Vital Signs  
Descriptive summaries of the vital signs (both raw and change from baseline values) 
including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be 
prepared for each dose  group. Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables will 
include sample size, mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, minimum, and

appropriate (when there is more than 1 subject in a cohort).  
Vital sign values will be classified as low, normal or high based on the cut -off points 
defined below, and the data will be summarized by presenting shift tables from baseline 
to each post -baseline visit.  For Baseline vita l sign measurements:  
Measurement  Lower Upper Unit

10.1 INFORMED CONSENT  
A copy of the proposed informed consent document must be submitted to the sponsor 
for review and comment prior to submission to the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC). The consent form must be 
approved by the IRB/ IEC and contain all elements required by national, state, local and 
institutional regulations or requirements.  
The study will be completely explained to each prospective study subject.  Each subject 
found to be eligible for the study must voluntarily provi de written informed consent 
(including consent for the use and disclosure of research -related health information), 
using the IRB/IEC -approved consent form, prior to his or her enrollment in the study 
(i.e., before any protocol -dictated procedures that are not part of normal patient care 
are performed).  
10.2 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE 
REVIEW AND APPROVAL  
The investigator shall assure that an IRB/IEC, constituted in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice ( GCP), will provide initial and continuing review of the study.  
The investigator should provide the sponsor with a list of IRB/IEC members or IRB 
assurance number.  Any documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its 
responsibilities, such as protocol amendments, and information concerning subject 
recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or information from the sponsor 
will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The IRB/IEC’s written unconditional approval of the 
study pro tocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the 
investigator and the sponsor/designee, before the study is initiated.  The investigator 
will transmit the IRB/IEC’s unconditional approval statement to the sponsor/designee 
before study dr ug supplies are shipped to the site.  This approval must refer to the study 
by exact protocol title and number  and should identify the documents reviewed and the 
date of review.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 71 The Principal Investigator must inform the IRB/IEC of:  
• Changes in informed cons ent 
• Revisions of other documents originally submitted for review  
• Serious and/or unexpected adverse events occurring during the study  
• New information that may adversely affect the safety of subjects or the conduct 
of the study  
• Annual update and/or request for re-approval 
• Study completion  
10.3 PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE  
Except for a change that is intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a 
study subject, the protocol shall be conducted as described.  Any such change must be 
reported immediately to the sponso r and to the IRB/IEC.  
10.4 PROTOCOL REVISIONS  
Protocol amendments will be prepared and approved by the sponsor.  All protocol 
amendments will be signed by the investigator and submitted to the IRB/IEC for review 
prior to implementation.  Documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be forwarded to 
the sponsor.  If an amendment significantly alters the study design, increases potential 
risk to the subject or otherwise affects statements in the informed consent form, the 
informed consent form must be revised accordingly an d submitted to the IRB/IEC for 
review and approval.  The approved consent form must be used to obtain informed 
consent from new subjects prior to enrollment and must be used to obtain informed 
consent from subjects already enrolled if they are affected by t he amendment.  
10.5 DATA COLLECTION  
All data collected for each study subject will be entered in the eCRF developed in the 
Clinical Database and approved by the Sponsor.  The database will be 21 CFR Part 11 -
compliant.  The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, 
such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, 
or inaccurate.  The investigator is responsible for maintaining the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  All source documents 
should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.

FINAL / Version 5.0 1-AUGUST -2018 Page 72 Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with 
the source documents.  
The primary source document for this study  will be the subject’s medical record.  Data 
for the efficacy and tolerability variables will be recorded on a Data Sheet to be 
provided by Sponsor or designee and made part of the subject’s medical record.  The 
Data Sheet will be similar to a paper CRF and will serve as a “hard copy” source 
document in case the eCRF becomes damaged or otherwise compromised. If the 
investigator(s) maintain separate research records, both the medical record and the 
research records will be considered the source documents for t he purposes of auditing 
the study.  
The anonymity of subjects must be maintained.  Subjects will be identified by their 
initials and an assigned subject number on eCRFs and other documents submitted to 
the sponsor.  Documents that identify the subject beyond initials and subject number 
will not be submitted to the sponsor (e.g.; the signed informed consent document) and 
must be maintained in strict confidence by the investigator, except to the extent 
necessary to allow auditing by the regulatory authorities, s tudy monitor, or sponsor 
representatives.  
Data recorded on source documents will be entered into eCRFs.  The investigator must 
promptly review the completed eCRFs for each subject.  A study monitor representing 
the sponsor will review the source documents against the eCRF on a regular basis 
through the study period as per the Study Monitoring Plan.   
Each eCRF will be electronically signed and dated by the Investigator.  
10.6 DATA MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
For data coding, the following medical diction aries will be used:  
• AEs and concomitant diseases: MedDRA ; 
• Concomitant medication: World Health Organization (WHO) – Drug 
Visual and computerized methods of data validation will be applied in order to ensure 
accurate, consistent and reliable data for the subsequent statistical analysis.  These

over time, and possible undetected protocol violations (eligibility criteria, time and 
medication compliance, etc.).  
Data Manageme nt and the study monitor will generate electronic queries for resolution 
by the site.  
The database will be locked in order to protect write access after the following 
preconditions are fulfilled:  
• All data are entered in the database  
• All data queries are re solved 
• All necessary quality checks, in accordance with appropriate Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), have been performed  
• Decisions have been made and agreed as to the identities of all protocol violators  
• All eCRFs have been source verified by the stud y monitor in the remote data 
capture (RDC)  
• All eCRFs have been approved by the Investigator in the RDC system  
• Written authorization from Vizuri Health Sciences is obtained.  
Upon completion of the study and resolution of all outstanding queries, Data 
Management will lock the database and generate the SAS datasets necessary for data 
analysis and reporting.  
The Data Management group will use the Clinical Database for storing and managing 
all data generated by this trial.  
10.7 STUDY MONITORING

is being conducted according to the protocol.  Auditors representing the sponsor may 
also similarly evaluate the study and its monitors.  For these purposes, the investigator 
will make eCRFs and sourc e documents available when requested.  
In addition, the study may be evaluated by representatives of the regulatory authorities, 
who will also be allowed access to study documents.  The investigators should promptly 
notify Vizuri Health Sciences or its desig nee of any audits they have scheduled with 
any regulatory authority.  
The sponsor will promptly notify all investigators of all SAEs requiring expedited 
reporting that are considered unexpected and associated with the study drug.  The 
investigator must also report these AEs to the IRB/IEC responsible for reviewing the 
study. SAEs that are expected and unrelated to the study drug will be reported 
periodically.  
If Vizuri Health Sciences, its designee, the investigator, the IRB/IEC or regulatory 
authority discov er conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study should 
be halted or that the study center should be terminated, this action may be taken after 
appropriate consultation between Vizuri Health Sciences and the investigator.  
10.8 DRUG ACCOUNTABI LITY 
Upon receipt, the investigator is responsible for taking an inventory of the study drug.  
A record of this inventory must be kept and usage must be documented on study drug 
inventory forms provided by the Sponsor.  
10.9 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
The investigator shall retain records and source documents pertaining to the study, 
including any films, tracings, computer discs or tapes.  They will be retained for the 
longer of the maximum period required by the country and institution in which the 
study is conducted, o r the period specified by the sponsor at the time the study is 
completed, terminated or discontinued.

such transfer shall be documented in writing and provided to the sponsor.  
10.10 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  
The investigator will provide Vizuri Health Sciences sufficient and accurate 
information on financial interests (proprietary or equity interests , payments exclusive 
of clinical trial costs) to allow complete disclosure to regulatory authorities.  The 
investigator shall promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during 
the course of the investigation and for a period of one year following study completion.  
10.11 PUBLICATION POLICY  
Upon completion of the study, investigators are encouraged to publish the results in 
recognized scientific journals and at seminars or conferences.  For multi -center trials, 
no investigator will be authorized t o publish study results from an individual center 
until the earlier of the multi -center trial results are published or 12 months after the end 
or termination of the multi -center trial at all sites.  
A copy of all manuscripts and abstracts related to the study must be submitted to the 
sponsor for review and comment at least 30 days prior to submission for publication or 
for presentation at a scientific meeting.  Proposed abstracts and publications will be 
reviewed promptly.  The sponsor may delay publication  for up to 90 days to allow the 
filing of a patent application or for other important reasons.  The sponsor also reserves 
the right to delete from such materials any part or parts deemed to be confidential or 
proprietary.

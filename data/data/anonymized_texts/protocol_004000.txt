  Proprietary and Confidential  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A Randomized  Phase 3 , Open -Label Trial of Sipuleucel -T Administered to 
Patients on Active Surveillance for Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer  
Protocol Number:  P17-1 
Clinical Phase:  3 
Investigational Product, Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:  
Sipuleucel -T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy available as a suspension for 
intravenous infusion.  Sipuleucel -T consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells  
(PBMC) , including antigen presenting cells (APCs) that have been activated during a defined  
culture period with a recombinant human protein, PAP -GM-CSF, consisting of prostatic acid 
phosphatase (PAP), an antigen expressed in prostate cancer tissue, linked to granulocyte -
macrophage colony- stimulating factor (GM -CSF), an immune cell activator.  Each dose of 
sipuleucel -T contains a minimum of 50 million autologous CD54+ cells activated with PAP -
GM-CSF, suspended in 250 mL of Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP.  
The active components of sipuleucel -T are autologous APCs and PAP -GM-CSF.  During 
culture, the recombinant antigen binds  to and is  processed by APCs into smaller protein 
fragments.  The recombinant antigen is designed to target APCs, and may help direct the 
immune response to PAP.  Minimal residual levels of the intact PAP -GM-CSF are detectable 
in the final sipuleucel -T product.  
The patient's PBMCs  are obtained via a standard leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 days 
prior to the infusion date.  Due to the autologous nature of sipuleucel -T, it is important that the 
patient and physician adhere to the personalized leukapheresis and infusion schedules.  
The cellular composition of sipuleucel -T is dependent on the composition of cells obtained 
from the patient's leukapheresis.   In addition to APCs, the final product contains T cells, B 
cells, natura l killer (NK) cells, and other cells.  The number of cells present and the cellular 
composition of each sipuleucel -T dose will vary.  
The potency of sipuleucel -T is in part determined by measuring the increased expression of the 
CD54 molecule, also known as  ICAM -1, on the surface of APCs after culture with PAP -GM-
CSF. CD54 is a cell surface molecule that plays a role in the immunologic interactions between 
APCs and T cells, and is considered a marker of immune cell activation.  
In-process and final sterility tests are initiated prior to shipping, but the final results are not 
available for up to 7 days.  Sipuleucel -T is released for shipping based on acceptable results 
from 2 -day incubation of the in -process sterility test (Sipuleuce l-T, 2017) .

Primary Objective:  
• To assess the efficacy of sipuleucel -T in reducing histopathologic reclassification to a 
higher Gleason grade in prostate cancer su bjects on active surveillance (AS)  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To assess the differential receipt of local or systemic therapy (surgery, radiation , 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) ) in each study  arm, and the reasons for receipt of 
further local or systemic therapy  
• To assess differences in quality of life (i.e., patient -reported outcomes (PRO))  between 
sipuleucel -T and c ontrol arms  
• To evaluate the safety of sipuleucel -T in men with low to intermed iate risk localized 
prostate cancer  
Exploratory Objectives:

treatment 
Study Design  and Duration:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, open- label  study of immunotherapy with sipuleucel -T 
compared to control  subjects followed on AS .  The study will enroll subjects being followed 
by AS and initially  diagnosed within 12 months prior to Screening with either ISUP Grade 
Group 1 or 2 adenocarcinoma of the  prostate.  
This study consists of 3 phase s (see Table 1  and Table 2 ): 
Screening Phase:  
The Screening Phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and 
continues until randomization.  Screening procedures will be performed up to 30 days prior to  
randomization. 
 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 6 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  The following assessments will be performed on all subjects d uring the S creening P hase:   
• BICR of p rostate biopsy slides obtained from local pathologist  (ISUP Grade Group and 
Gleason Score)  
• Clinical evaluations (demographics, medical history, PE & vital signs , digital rectal 
examination (DRE) , Eastern Cooperative Onc ology Group ( ECOG)  performance 
status, cardiovascular r isk assessment & electrocardiogram  (ECG)) 
• Cardiovascular and thrombosis disease history  
• Concomitant m edications 
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• PROs/Quality of life questionnaires  
• Virology serology (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, HCV antibody (Ab), if Ab positive (Ab+) 
then HCV RNA), HIV -1, HIV- 2 antibody screen and H TLV -1, HTLV -2 antibodies  
• Hematology and c hemistry  
• PSA 
• Total t estosterone  
Active Phase:  
The Active Phase will begin at randomization and continues through completion of the end of 
Active Phase study visit (within 30 days of B iopsy 2) or until the study is terminated by the 
sponsor .   
Subject s who withdraw consent and discontinue from the study prior to completing the end of 
Active Phase study visit  will undergo an Early Withdrawal visit within 30 days following 
discontinuation notice. Subjects are encouraged to have, a s standard of care, a systematic  
prostate biopsy  (≥10 cores) with or without MRI at the investigator’s discretion prior to study 
withdrawal.  The H&E and special -stained slides from this biopsy will be submitted for BICR 
determination of their ISUP Grade Group classification prior to study withdrawal.  
After Screening  assessments are completed , eligible subjects will be randomized 2:1 to the 
sipuleucel -T arm or the control arm.  Subjects randomized to sipuleucel -T arm will undergo 
their first leukapheresis within 60 days of randomization and will receive 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T at approximately 2-week intervals.   Subjects randomized to t he control arm will 
be followed on AS  as described in the schedule of events ( Table 2 ).  
Subjects randomized to the sipul eucel -T arm will be evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, and 26 
weeks following the first infusion for : 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 7 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  • Immune responses (Week 0 prior to first infusion is baseline) 
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• Concomitant m edications 
• AEs and s erious adverse events ( SAEs ) (per reporting requirements for the sipuleucel -
T arm)  
Subjects randomized to the control arm will be evaluated (office visit or phone) at 3 months 
following randomization for:  
• Survival status  
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• Concomitant medications 
• All AEs and SAEs  
Subsequently, all subjects in the sipuleucel -T and control arms  will be followed every 6 months 
from date of randomization for at least 36 months for:  
• Immune responses ( sipuleucel -T arm only)  
• Survival status  
• PSA levels (should be collected prior to  DRE and biopsy procedures)  
• DRE assessments  
• Prostate cancer d isease progression  
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• Concomitant m edications 
• All AEs and SAEs   
Note , for subjects randomized to the  sipuleucel -T arm, scheduled events for the 26- week visit 
post first infusion and first 6- month visit post -randomization may take place on the same visit  
and only one set of immune samples need to be collected  
 
  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 8 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  During the Active Phase, all subjects in the sipuleucel -T and  control arms  will complete : 
•  PROs/Quality of life questionnaires (Max -PC, SF -12, EPIC -CP, and IPSS) annually 
(12-, 24-, and 36- month visits)  post randomization.  PROs/Quality of life questionnaires 
should be collected prior to any procedures on these spec ified visits.  
• Two ( 2) systematic biopsies (Biopsy 1 & Biopsy 2; ≥10 cores each)  will be 
administered as standard of care.   Additional cores may be collected by MRI guidance 
per investigator discretion ; however, MRI targeted cores collected at baseline should 
be repeated for Biopsy 1 & Biopsy 2 (Appendix 7 ). 
Biopsy 1 will be administered between 12 and 18 months, and Biopsy 2 will be administered 
between 33 and 39 months post randomization.  All hematoxylin and eosin (H&E ) and special 
stained slides will be assessed for histopathologic grading by BICR.  Slides from each biopsy will be considered as a group to determine the ISUP Grade Group as opposed to any single slide .  The BICR is blinded to a subject’s study arm randomiz ation.  BICR will receive the 
local pathology staining methods and Gleason score.  All subject information should be redacted from the local pathology reports and slides.  Local pathology r eports and slides will 
be identified only by study subject number.  All slides will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Post randomization, central pathology requested formalin -fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE)  
tissue blocks identified by study subject number will be sent to the central pathology lab for cutting and slide preparation for immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  and genomic analysis .  All tissue 
blocks will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Upon study completion, if the primary endpoint is met subjects on the control a rm may  be 
offered sipuleucel -T. 
Follow -up Phas e:  
Once a subject  from either the sipuleucel -T or control arms  completes the end of Active Phase 
visit, they will enter the Follow -up Phase and complete Follow -up Phase visits every 6 months 
starting from their last Active Phase visit.  The Follow -up Phase visits end when the  last subject 
enrolled completes B iopsy 2 and end of Active Phase visit or until the study is terminated by 
the sponsor.  All s ubjects will be assessed for:  
• Survival status  
• PROs/Quality of life questionnaires  
• PSA levels ( as available by local laboratory)  
• Prostate cancer d isease progression  
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• All AEs and SAEs

  Proprietary and Confidential  Study Population and Sample Size  
Potential subjects are  men ≥18 yea rs that have undergone prostate biopsy and diagnosed with 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate within the 12 months prior to study Screening .  Subjects 
diagnosed with either ISUP Grade Group 1 or 2 prostate cancer will undergo Screening  
procedures to ensure that they me et the inclusion and exclusion criteria.   
Subjects diagnosed with ISUP Grade Group 1 are required to have a minimum of 3 positive 
biopsy cores or one core with 50% or more cancer to be eligible for the study.   
Subjects diagnosed with ISUP Grade Group 2 will have less than 50%  of total number of any 
cores positive to be eligible for the study.  See inclusion criteria 4 for further details.    
Subjects will be stratified by 1 or >1 biopsy ≤12 months prior to screening that will balance 
between arms for the number of prior biopsies and the utilization of MRI guided biopsy for a 
second or confirmatory biopsy.  
Approximately 450 e ligible subjects will be randomized 2:1 to either sipuleucel -T arm or 
control  arm.  ISUP Grade Group 1 will be capped at 80% of study population. 
Stratification will be based on:  
• ISUP Grade Group 1 or 2 
• Number biopsies 1 or >1 (≤12 months of Screening ) 
Inclusion Criteria  
For a subject to be eligible for participation in this study, all  of the following criteria must be 
satisfied.  
1. Age is ≥ 18 years  
2. Written informed consent provided prior to the initiation of study procedures  
3. Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate initially diagnosed ≤12 months of 
Screening.  All biopsy slides with subject information redacted must be submitted for BICR.  
4. Prostate cancer diagnosis determined by BICR as one of the following:  
a. ISUP Grade Group 1 with 3 or more cores positive from a systematic (≥10 cores) 
biopsy  
b. ISUP Grade Group 1 with ≥ 1 core positive with ≥50% cancer involvement  from a 
systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 ,  25 January 2019 Page 17 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  c. ISUP Grade Group 1 from 3 or more positive cores from any combination of cores 
from a systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy and MRI targeted biopsy (note: multiple cores from each MRI targeted lesion will count as 1 core)  
d. ISUP Grade Group 1 from a negative systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy and an MRI targeted core positive with ≥50% cancer involvement  
e. ISUP Grade Group 2 from a systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy with <50% of the total 
number of any cores positive for cancer  
f. ISUP Grade Group 2 from a negative systematic (≥10 cores) biopsy and MRI 
targeted core(s) positive for Gleason 3+4 (see note below)   
g. ISUP Grade Group 2 from any combination of cores from a systematic (≥10 cores) 
biopsy and MRI targeted biopsy (see note be low) 
Note for f and g:  the total number of positive cores must be <50% of total cores from both 
the systematic biopsy and MRI targeted lesions; each MRI targeted lesion, irrespective of multiple positive cores, will each count as 1 core for the total numbe r of positive cores, e.g., 
4 targeted lesions with 2 positive cores each will only add 4 to the total core count.  
5. Subject consents to standard of care for biopsy frequency of 2 on- study prostate biopsies 
and to provide biopsy tissue for study endpoint ana lysis.  
6. Estimated life expectancy ≥ 10 years

ketoconazole, an estrogen -containing nutraceutical, or high dose calcitriol (>0.5 μg/day).  
The Investigator will consider herbal therapies on a case- by-case basis to determine whether 
they fall into the category of prohibited medications based on their potential for hormonal 
or anti -cancer or anti -cancer properties.  
11. Need for systemic chronic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., anti -tumor necrosis factor  
alpha monoclonal antibodies, glucocorticoids)

active infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Classification III- IV) (Appendix 6)  or unstable angina pectoris within the last 6 months, or 
psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements  as well as any 
condition that would preclude a subject from undergoing leukapheresis (e.g., within the 
previous 6 months: myocardial  infarction, interventional cardiology procedure such as 
angioplasty or stent placement, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) .   
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 ,  25 January 2019 Page 19 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  13. Hypogonadal (T <  175 ng/dL) or on continuous testosterone replacement therapy  
14. Positive serology for HIV -1, HIV -2 or HTLV -1, HTLV -2 
15. Active hepatitis B or C (See Appendix 8 and Appendix 9 for definitions)  
16. Any medical intervention, any other condition, or any other circumstance which, in the 
opinion of the investigator or the sponsor’s Medical Monitor, could compromise adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study’s objectives.  
Statistical Considerations  
The Phase 3, open- label  study is designed to assess the effects of sipuleucel -T in subjects on 
AS.  The primary endpoint will analyze a pproximately 450 subjects randomized (2:1 sipuleucel -
T arm versus control arm ). 
It is estimated that the proportion of increased histopathologic  grade reclassification  over the 36 
months following randomization for the control  arm will be approximately 0.30.  While there 
is no prior information on sipuleucel -T treatment response in early -stage disease available, a 
meaningful hypothesized reduction in this proportion is a  reduction by 0.14, giving a projected 
outcome proportion of upgrading in the sipuleucel -T arm of 0.16.  The null hypothesis of both 
arms having a proportion of 0.70 (= 1-  0.30) being free from upgrading at 36 months  versus the 
specific alternative hypothe sis of a sipuleucel -T arm outcome of 0.84 (= 1-  0.16).  The odds 
ratio associated with the specific alternative hypothesis is 2.25 ( sipuleucel -T arm odds over 
control arm odds).  Based on an overall 1- sided alpha of 0.025 approximately 300 subjects in 
the sipuleucel -T arm and 150 subjects in the control  arm will provide 90% power to demonstrate 
the superiority of sipuleucel -T to control .

adeq uate final report shortly after study participation is complete.   
1.4 Informed Consent  
Investigators are responsible for obtaining written informed consent from subjects prior to 
initiation of any study procedures.  The investigator or an appropriately qualif ied delegate will 
obtain informed consent, document the steps of the informed consent process in the subject’s medical record, and provide a copy of the signed ICF to the subject.  
The ICF, including any amendments, must first be reviewed and approved by th e sponsor or 
designee and then by the designated IRB prior to use in the study.  
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, or increases the potential risk to subjects, the ICF will be revised and submit ted to the IRB for 
review and approval.  The revised ICF must be used to obtain informed consent from subjects currently participating in the study if the information is relevant, or per the IRB’s instructions.  The revised ICF will be used to obtain infor med consent from any new subject who is enrolled 
in the study after the IRB approval date of the amendment. 
1.5 Subject Confidentiality  
Subjects’ medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered confidential, as 
defined by applicable local, state, and federal law, and disclosure of this information to third parties other than those noted below is prohibited.  Subject identifiers (e.g., name, initials, or date of birth) will be kept confidential.  A subject’s medical information may be given to the subject’s personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the subject’s welfare.  Data generated as a result of this study will be available for inspection on request by 
the FDA or other regulatory authorities, sponsor or its representatives, or the IRB.  Sponsor or 
designee may retain subjects’ medical information with subject identifiers redacted.  
Subject identifiers will not be collected on electronic case report forms ( eCRF s) maintained by 
the sponsor or designee  with the exception of date of birth and the C hain of I dentity (COI) 
number of each sipuleucel -T infusion.  Subject identifiers will not be disclosed in any 
publication related to this study.

  Proprietary and Confidential  Because sipuleucel -T is an autologous product, a unique COI number for each sipuleucel -T 
product  must be maintained from the time of initial collection of blood during leukapheresis 
until infusion, to ensure each subject receives the correct product.  Dendreon uses a COI number 
and the subject’s full name and date of birth for this purpose.  The COI for sipuleucel -T begins 
when the subject is scheduled for sipuleucel -T infusion and is referenced during leukapheresis, 
maintained through the manufacturing process, and finally, referenced prior to infusion.  The COI number and subject’s full name and date of birth will be revealed to Dendreon scheduling, manufacturing, and leukapheresis personnel.  This disclosure is critical to ensuring subjects’ 
safety.  
2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
2.1.1 Prostate Cancer 
In the United States, an estimated 164,690 cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 2018 (Siegel , 2018) .  However, many of these men will have disease that may never cause morbidity 
or mortality due to their diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Therefore, the management of newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer detected on the basis of prostate -specifi c antigen (PSA) 
remains controversial.  Recently, Cooperberg et al. showed a shift from initial active treatment (e.g., surgery, radiation) to choosing AS ( Cooperberg, 2015) .  Active surveillance ( AS) delays 
or indefinitely postpones  the complications of surgery, radiation or androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) , while allowing for subsequent interventional treatment with similar clinical 
efficacy associated with immediate treatment  (Dall’Era, 2017) .  Men on AS are advised to 
adhere to  follow -up protocols  and schedules  (Borkhorst, 2015) , yet 25% to 45% of men were 
no longer on AS  after 5 to 15 years of follow -up (Klotz, 2015) .  The most common reasons for 
discontinuing AS were  PSA-doubling time (43.5%), grade progression (35%) patient preference 
(6%), and stage progression (3%) ( Klotz, 2015 ).  Recently, the PRIAS study investigators 
concluded Gleason  upgrading and disease re-classification (≥ cT3) as the only indicators for an 
immediate switch to active treatment.  Surrogate indicators such as number of posit ive cores 
and a PSA -doubling time of <3 years  should not trigger immediate active treatment but instead 
continued follow -up to confirm higher -risk disease (Borkhorst, 2016 ).  Thus histopathologic 
progression is an important indicator for prostate cancer progression and th e need for treatment, 
and decreasing  histopathologic progression would be a significant benefit for the AS prostate 
cancer population.  
2.1.2 Sipuleucel -T 
Sipuleucel -T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy available as a suspension for intravenous 
infusion.  S ipuleucel -T consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMC) , 
including antigen presenting cells (APCs)  that have been activated during a defined culture 
period with a recombinant human protein, PAP -GM-CSF, consisting of prostatic acid 
phosphatase (PAP), an antigen expressed in prostate cancer tissue, linked to granulocyte -
macrophage colony -stimulating facto r (GM -CSF), an immune cell activator.  Each dose of 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 ,  25 January 2019 Page 29 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  sipuleucel -T contains a minimum of 50 million autologous CD54+ cells activated with PAP -
GM-CSF, suspended in 250 mL of Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP.  
The active components of sipuleucel -T are autologous APCs and PAP -GM-CSF. During 
culture, the recombinant antigen binds  to and is  processed by APCs into smaller peptide  
fragments. The recombinant antigen is designed to target APCs, and may help direct the immune 
response to PAP.  Minimal residual levels of  the intact PAP -GM-CSF are detectable in the final 
sipuleucel -T product.  
The patient's PBMCs are obtained via a standard leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 days 
prior to the infusion date.  Due to the autologous nature of sipuleucel -T, it is important  that the 
patient and physician adhere to the personalized leukapheresis and infusion schedules.  
The cellular composition of sipuleucel -T is dependent on the composition of cells obtained from 
the patient's leukapheresis.  In addition to APCs, the final pr oduct contains T cells, B cells, 
natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells.  The number of cells present and the cellular 
composition of each sipuleucel -T dose will vary.  
The potency of sipuleucel -T is in part determined by measuring the increased express ion of the 
CD54 molecule, also known as ICAM -1, on the surface of APCs after culture with PAP -GM-
CSF.  CD54 is a cell surface molecule that plays a role in the immunologic interactions between 
APCs and T cells, and is considered a marker of immune cell act ivation.  
In-process and final sterility tests are initiated prior to shipping, but the final results are not 
available for up to 7 days.  Sipuleucel -T is released for shipping based on acceptable results 
from 2 -day incubation of the in -process sterility te st (Sipuleuce l-T, 2017) . 
Sipuleucel -T induces robust and long- lived antigen -specific cellular and humoral immune 
responses that target prostate cancer cells.   The magnitude of the immune response correlates 
with overall survival (OS) in subjects with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer  
(mCRPC)  (Sheikh, 2013).  
Sipuleucel -T administered to subjects prior to radical prosta tectomy demonstrated both a 
systemic antigen -specific T cell response and a local response with the recruitment of activated 
effector T cells into the prostate tumor microenvironment (Fong, 2014).   In subjects with non-
metastatic hormone -sensitive prostate cancer, the magnitude of immunoglobulin G  responses 
to antigen was significantly higher, and the magnitude of secondary antibody responses (antigen 
spread) , as well as APC activation was significantly greater when compared to  subjects with 
mCRPC ( Antonarakis, 2017) .  These data suggest sipuleucel -T may have a more robust anti -
cancer effect in non -metastatic hormone -sensitive prostate cancer subjects and the potential to 
slow or inhibit the development of more aggressive disease requiring treatment for men on AS. 
The p urpose of this study is to determine if sipuleucel -T will decrease the development of 
histopathologic progression upon subsequent prostate biopsies for subjects on AS.

5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1  Study Design and Duration  
This is a multicenter, randomized, open- label study of immunotherapy with sipuleucel -T 
compared to control  subjects followed on AS .  The study will enroll subjects being followed by 
AS and initially diagnosed within 12 months prior to Screening with either ISUP Grade Group 
1 or 2 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  
This study consists of 3 phases (see Section 8.0 for more details):  
Screening Phase:  
The Screening Phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and continue s 
until randomization.  Screening procedures will be performed up to 30 days prior to 
randomization.  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 ,  25 January 2019 Page 32 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  The following assessments will be performed on all subjects during the Screening Phase:  
• BICR of p rostate biopsy slides obtained from local pathologist ( ISUP Grade Group and 
Gleason Score)  
• Clinical evaluations (demographics, medical history, PE & vital signs , digital rectal 
examination (DRE) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status , 
cardiovascular risk assessment & electrocardiogram  (ECG)) 
• Cardiovascular  and thrombosis disease history  
• Concomitant medications 
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• PROs/Quality of life questionnaires  
• Virology serology (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, HCV antibody(Ab), if Ab positive (Ab+) 
then HCV RNA) ), HIV -1 and HIV -2 antibody screen and HTLV -1, HTLV- 2 antibodies  
• Hematology and chemistry  
• PSA 
• Total testosterone  
Active Phase:  
The Active Phase will begin at randomization and continues through completion of the end of Active Phase study visit (within 30 days of Biopsy 2) or until the study is terminated by the 
sponsor .  Subjects who withdraw consent and discontinue from the study prior completing end 
of Active Phase study visit  will undergo an Early Withdrawal visit within 30 days following 
discontinuation notice ( Section 6.3 ).  Subjects are encouraged to have, as standard of care, a 
systematic prostate biopsy  (≥10 cores) with or without MRI at the investigator’s discretion prior 
to study withdrawal.  The H&E and special -stained slides from this biopsy will be submitted 
for  BICR determination of their ISUP Grade Group classification  prior to study withdrawal  
After Screening  assessments are completed , eligible subjects will be randomized 2:1 to the 
sipuleucel -T arm or the control arm.  Subjects randomized to sipuleucel -T arm will undergo 
their first leukapheresis within 60 days of ra ndomization and will receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel -T at approximately 2-week intervals.  Subjects randomized to the control arm will 
be followed on AS  as described in the schedule of events ( Table 2 ).

PR-2677.02 ,  25 January 2019 Page 33 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  Subjects randomized to the sipuleucel -T arm will be evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, and 26 weeks 
following the first infusion for:  
• Immune responses  (Week 0 prior to first infusion is baseline) 
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• Concomitant medications 
• Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) (per reporting requirements 
for the sipuleucel -T arm) ( Section 9)  
Subjects randomized to the control arm will be evaluated (office visit or phone) at 3 months 
following randomization for:  
• Survival status  
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• Concomitant medications 
• All AEs and SAEs  
Subsequently, all subjects in the sipuleucel -T and control arms will be followed every 6 months 
from date of randomization for at least 36 months  for: 
• Immune responses  (sipuleucel -T arm only)  
• Survival status  
• PSA levels (should be collected prior to DRE  and biopsy procedures)  
• DRE assessments  
• Prostate cancer d isease progression  
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• Concomitant medications  
• All AEs and SAEs  
Note , for subjects randomized to the  sipuleucel -T arm, scheduled events for the 26- week visit 
post first infusion and first 6 -month visit post randomization may take place on the same visit  
and only one set of immune samples need to be collec ted.

PR-2677.02 ,  25 January 2019 Page 34 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  During the Active Phase, all subjects in the sipuleucel -T and control arms will complete:  
•  PROs/Quality of life questionnaires (Max -PC, SF- 12, EPIC -CP, and IPSS) annually 
(12-, 24-, and 36- month visits) post randomization.  PROs/Quality of life quest ionnaires 
should be collected prior to any procedures on these specified visits.  
• Two (2) systematic biopsies (Biopsy 1 & Biopsy 2; ≥10 cores each) ) will be 
administered  as standard of care.  Additional cores may be collected by MRI guidance 
per investigator  discretion ; however, MRI targeted cores collected at baseline should be 
repeated for Biopsy 1 & Biopsy 2 ( Appendix 7) . 
Biopsy 1 will be administered between 12 and 18 months, and Biopsy 2 will be administered 
between 33 and 39 months post randomization.  All hematoxylin and eosin (H&E ) and special 
stained slides will be assessed for histopathologic grading by BICR. Slides from each biopsy 
will be considered as a group to determine the ISUP Grade Group as opposed to any single slide .   The BICR is blinded to a subject’s study arm randomization.  BICR will receive the local 
pathology staining methods and Gleason score.  All s ubject information should be redacted from 
the local pathology reports and slides.  Local pathology reports and slides will be identified only by study subject number.  All slides will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Post randomization, central pat hology requested formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE)  
tissue blocks identified by study subject number will be sent to the central pathology lab for 
cutting and slide preparation for immunohistochemistry (IHC)  and genomic analysis .  All tissue 
blocks will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Follow -up Phase:  
Once a subject from either the sipuleucel -T or control arm s completes the end of Active Phase 
visit, they will enter into Follow -up Phase and will complete Follow -up Phase visits every 6 
months  starting from their last Active Phase visit .  The Follow -up Phase end when the last 
subject enrolled completes Biopsy 2 and end of Active Phase visit or until the study is terminated by the sponsor. All subjects will be assessed for:  
• Survival status  
• PROs/ Quality of life questionnaires   
• PSA levels ( as available by local laboratory)  
• Prostate cancer d isease progression  
• All anti- prostate cancer therapies  
• AEs and SAEs ( per reporting requirements for each arm; S ection 9)

opinion of the investigator or the sponsor’s Medical Monitor, could compromise 
adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study’s objectives.  
6.3 Discontinuation from Study  
A subject may discontinue participation in the trial at any time without prejudice.  If a subject withdraws consent for any further study involvement, complete withdrawal of consent must be documented in the subject’ s medical record.  The date and reason for withdrawal will be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the e CRF . 
Whenever possible, every subject who withdraws consent and discontinues from the study will undergo a n Early Withdraw al Visit within 30 days following discontinuation notice .  Subjects 
are encouraged to have , as standard of care, a systematic prostate biopsy (≥10 cores) with or 
without MRI at the investigator’s discretion prior to study withdrawal.  The H&E and special -
stained slides fr om this biopsy will be submitted for BICR determination of their ISUP Grade 
Group classification prior to study withdrawal.  All AEs considered by the investigator to be 
related to sipuleucel -T that are ongoing at the time of discontinuation will be follow ed by the 
investigator until resolution, return to baseline, or a determination by the investigator that no 
further improvement is expected.  The investigator should make every reasonable attempt to ensure that the subject is contacted (via telephone or during the E arly Withdrawal Visit) to 
obtain the final status of any AEs and concomitant medications. 
6.3.1 Discontinuation from Sipuleucel -T Arm  
Declining the first sipuleucel -T infusion or associated leukapheresis will result in an automatic 
withdrawal from the study.  Subjects will complete an early withdraw  visit within 30 days of 
the scheduled sipuleucel -T infusion.  
Sipuleucel -T will be discontinued if a subject meets any of the following criteria:  
• The subject ne ver undergoes a leukapheresis for the purpose of receiving sipuleucel -T 
• The subject undergoes leukapheresis, but is unable to receive at least 1 partial (>0 mL) 
sipuleucel -T infusion for any reason at the discretion of sponsor’s Medical Monitor

• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the i nvestigator or sponsor  
6.3.2 Discontinuation from Study Participation  
A subject in either the sipuleucel -T or control study arm s will end study participation, including 
discontinuation of sipuleucel -T (sipuleucel -T arm only) , biopsy and blood sample collection, 
for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject withdraws consent or loses the ability to provide informed consent to 
participate in the study for any reason 
• The subject is diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer  
• The subject dies or is lost to follow -up (Section 6.5 ) 
6.4 Replacement of Subjects

mL) may be replaced.  
6.5 Lost to Follow -up 
If a subject fails to respond to requests for follow -up, the clinical trial site will send a certified 
letter, at a minimum, to the subject requesting contact with the clinic.  All attempts to resume contact (including copies of written correspondence) wil l be included in the subject's medical 
record.  Subjects who do not respond to requests for follow -up after all the above attempts to 
establish contact will be considered lost to follow -up.   
6.6 Permitted Therapies 
Subjects should receive full supportive care  in accordance with standard practice at the clinical 
trial site.

  Proprietary and Confidential  7.0 SIPULEUCEL- T TREATMENT  
7.1 Overview  
Dendreon will supply sipuleucel -T that must be  stored, handled, prepared, administered, and 
labeled as specified by the current version of the sipuleucel -T Investigator’s Brochure.  
Accountability documentation must be maintained to ensure that sipuleucel -T is accurately 
administered.  Such documentation will note request, shipment, receipt, storage, dispensation, 
administration, destruction, return, and use of required processes.  
7.2 Sipuleucel -T Treatment  
7.2.1 Leukapheresis and Infusion Scheduling  
Once a subject has completed  screening assessments and has been confirmed to be eligible and 
randomized to the sipuleucel -T arm , Dendreon will designate a leukapheresis center and the site 
will request a schedule for the subject’s leukapheresis procedures to occur at approximately 2 -
week intervals.  The date of each leukapheresis procedure will determine the date for the 
subsequent infusion of sipuleucel -T (approximately 3 days later).  
The clini cal trial site will receive confirmation of the leukapheresis and infusion dates and will 
schedule the subject’s infusion appointments accordingly.  If the subject is subsequently deemed 
ineligible for the study, the clinical trial site will be informed an d the leukapheresis and infusion 
appointments will be canceled.  
7.2.2 Pre-leukapheresis Assessments  
Prior to each leukapheresis, subject s will undergo a pre -leukapheresis assessment to determine 
their suitability for the leukapheresis procedure .  The pre-leukapheresis assessment s including 
any requested tests by the apheresis center  should be done within 7 days prior to each  
leukapheresis . 
If a subject has any infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or causing fever (temperature >  100.5°F or > 38.1°C) within  7 days  prior to a leukapheresis appointment, the 
appointment should be rescheduled to occur after the fever resolves and the investigator believes the subject is healthy enough to undergo the procedure.  
7.2.3 Subject Preparation for Leukapheres is 
The subject should be instructed to eat calcium -rich foods in advance of the leukapheresis 
procedure.  The subject should also be instructed to drink plenty of fluids a few days prior to the procedure to promote adequate venous access during leukapheres is, but to avoid drinking 
caffeinated beverages on the day of each leukapheresis procedure.  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019  Page 44 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  7.2.4 Leukapheresis  
To manufacture of one dose of sipuleucel -T, the subject will undergo leukapheresis in order to 
collect PBMC .  All PBMC collected from one leukapheresis procedure will be used to produce 
one dose of sipuleucel -T.  Immediately after completion of the leukapheresis procedure, the 
PBMC are transported to a Dendreon immunotherapy manufacturing facility (IMF).  
7.2.5 Sipuleucel -T Infusion 
Each sipuleucel -T product  is released by Dendreon for infusion approximately 3 days after the 
leukapheresis procedure.    The clinical trial site will provide all supplies required for infusion.  
Sipuleucel -T must be administered under the supervis ion of an investigator experienced in the 
medical treatment of prostate cancer and in an environment where resuscitation equipment is 
available.  
7.2.6 Sipuleucel -T Product Failures and Leukapheresis Rescheduling  
A subject may be scheduled for a repeat leukapheresis procedure if the subject’s leukapheresis procedure fails, sipuleucel -T does not meet quality release specifications, sipuleucel -T infusion 
is not started prior to its expiration, or for various other re asons.  Rescheduling will depend 
upon the capacities of the leukapheresis center and the Dendreon IMF, and ≥ 2 weeks should 
elapse between one leukapheresis procedure and the next  (1-week interval may be approved at 
the discretion of the Medical Monitor).  
If a subject’s subsequent  leukapheresis procedure is delayed or rescheduled for any reason, all 
protocol -specified pre -leukapheresis assessment conditions apply.  
In rare instances, it may be determined for a given subject that it is not possible to manufa cture 
sipuleucel -T that meets manufacturing release specifications  (Section 6.3.1) . 
7.3 Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
Subjects will receive 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T at approximately 2 week intervals .  Each dose 
of sipuleucel -T contains a minimum of 50 million autologous CD54+ cells activated with 
recombinant fusion protein composed PAP linked to GM -CSF (PA2024) .   
7.4 Sipuleucel -T Treatment Compliance  
Sipuleucel -T treatment compliance is evaluated by each  site’s clinical trial infusion personnel . 
7.5 Destruction and Return of Sipuleucel -T 
Clinical trial site personnel will dispose of sipuleucel -T bags and tubing according to 
institutional procedures for disposal of biohazardous waste that contains human blood.  All sipuleucel -T packaging materials and gel packs will be disposed of according to institutional 
procedures.  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol

  Proprietary and Confidential  8.2 Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained as described in Section 1.4.   
8.3 Screening  
All subjects must sign an ICF prior to the conduct of any study- related procedures.  A screening 
number will be assigned for  each subject.   Screening procedures will be performed up to 30 days 
prior to  randomization to allow suffic ient time for blood chemistries  and submission of all 
original stained pathology slides  along with local pathology report for BICR to determine ISUP 
Grade Group for inclusion criteria and randomization.  All subject information should be 
redacted from the local pathology reports and slides.  Local pathology r eports and slides will be 
identified only by subject screening number.  If a subject has more t han one  biopsy following 
their prostate cancer diagnosis , slides from each subsequent  biopsy will be sent for BICR.  The 
central pathologist’s report will determine whether the subject meets the prostate cancer 
eligibility criteria ( Section 6.0) .  All slides will be returned to the clinical trial site.  In the case 
of multiple biopsies, the biopsy with the highest ISUP Grade Group will be used as baseline.  
See the complete list of inclusion and exclusion cr iteria (Section 6.0) and the Schedule of Events 
(Table 1  and Table 2 ) for study details. 
Subjects who do not meet all inclusion criteria and/or who meet one or more  exclusion criteri a 
may be rescreened .  Rescreening is at the discretion of the investigator, but requires sponsor 
approval in writing.  Subjects who are to be rescreened must sign a new ICF prior to  rescreening.  
Rescreened subjects who had their initial screening performed within 30 days of randomization 
may use the initial screening laboratory results.  Rescreened subjects may use the initial ISUP 
Grade Group determined by BICR  if no additional biopsy has been administered .  Rescreening 
and subsequent randomization activities must be conducted in accordance with all protocol -
defined windows and timelines. 
Subjects who do not meet all eligibility criteria will be considered screen failures and will 
undergo no further study procedures.  The reason(s) for each screen failure will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the eC RF. 
8.4 Randomization  
Eligible s ubjects will be randomized to the sipuleucel -T arm or control  arms  in a 2:1 ratio based 
on a predetermined, computer -generated randomization schedule.  The randomization will be 
balanced by using block randomization.   
Stratification will be based on:  
• ISUP Grade Group 1 or 2 
• Number biopsies 1 or >1 (≤12 months of Screening)  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 52 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  Randomization will take  place across all clinical trial sites using an  Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT).  The I RT will assign a unique code, which will dictate the assignment  to 
either sipuleucel -T arm or control arm.  The requestor must use his or her own user identification 
and personal identificati on number when contacting the I RT, and will then give the relevant 
subject details to uniquely identify the subject.  
8.5 Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic information, including birth date, race, and ethnicit y will be recorded.   
Medical history will include date of prostate cancer diagnosis , ISUP Grade Group and prostate 
biopsy history.  Significant historic (with in the previous 5 years ) and current medical conditions 
or illnesses, allergies to medications, and surgical interventions occurring prior to informed 
consent will be recorded.  Medical history will include the subject’s serum PSA values and 
vaccinations in the 2 years prior to signing informed consent . 
8.6 Clinical Assessments

8.11 Histopathology Assessment  
During the Active Phase, subjects will have all H&E and special stained slides and local 
pathology reports from Biopsy 1 and Biopsy 2, as well as any unscheduled biopsies,  assessed 
for histopathologic grading by BICR .  Slides from each biopsy will be considered as a group to 
determine the ISUP Grade Group as opposed to any single slide.   All subject information should 
be redacted from th e local pathology reports and slides.  Local pathology r eports and slides will 
be identified only by study subject number.  All slides will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
Subjects on the Active Phase undergoing a radical prostatectomy will submit H&E and special 
stained slides from prostate slices for BICR  as described above.  These will be compared to  the 
ISUP Grade Group determined from previous biopsy.  FFPE tissue  blocks  from the radical 
prostatectomy as requested by central pathology  will be s ubmitted for IHC.  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 55 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  Subjects with an ISUP Grade Group upgrade and who remain on AS  (i.e., do not undergo 
prostate cancer therapy) will remain in the Active Phase and continue per the Schedule of Events  
(Table 1  and Table 2 ).  
8.12 Immunohistochemistry Evaluations  
Post randomization, s pecific FFPE tissue blocks from biopsies or surgery will be requested by 
central pathology from their BICR that represents areas of cancer  and benign prostate tissue 
identified on H&E and special stained slides.  All subject information should be redacted from 
the FFPE blocks , and FFPE blocks should be identified only by study subject number.  These 
blocks will be freshly cut by the central pathology for IHC to assess infiltration and 
classification of lymphocytes (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, FoxP3, CD56, Ki67, CD279, MECA- 79) 
to prostate cancer tissue.  The geographic distribution of T cell phenotypes will be described 
relative to the tumor (central, peripheral, adjacent, or benign tissue localization).  All FFPE 
blocks  will be returned to the clinical trial site.  
8.13 Sipuleucel -T Immune Monitoring  Assessments  
Blood samples for immune monitoring will be collected at the time points noted in the Schedule 
of Events ( Table 1 ) for subjects randomized to the sipuleucel -T arm . 
Immune monitoring assessments will include proliferation assays to evaluate PA2024 - and 
PAP-specific T cell responses, IFN -γ ELISPOT assays to assess the number of PA2024 - and 
PAP-specific T cells, and enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA ) to assess humoral 
response to PA2024 and PAP.  Fluorescent immunoassays will be used to determine the number 
and activation status of subtypes of T cells, B cells, and NK cells, and the levels and types of cytokines . 
8.13.1 Sipuleucel -T Product Parameters  
Prior to infusion, samples from pre and post -culture sipuleucel -T are used to assess product 
parameters as part of the sipuleucel -T manufacturing process.  Sipuleucel -T product parameters 
inclu de total nucleated cell (TNC)  count, APC count, and APC activation.  
8.13.2 Sipuleucel -T Product Characterization  
Samples of final product will be used to characterize sipuleucel -T utilizing  flow cytometry, 
protein array, spectral analyses, ELISA, and Luminex assays to assess the immune response.  Tests may include assessment of the number and activation status of subtypes of T cells, B cells, and NK cells, and the levels and types of cytokines produced during the manufacture of sipuleucel -T. 
8.13.3 Additional Optiona l Research  (AOR) 
At the time of informed consent, subjects will be given the opportunity to consent to participate in AOR.  Subjects who consent to AOR agree to allow s ponsor or designee  to retain their

and sipuleucel -T product parameters and characterization, during manufacture) indefinitely and 
to use them for other testing.  For subjects who consent to AOR, no additional blood collections 
will be required beyond those alr eady being collected as part of the study.  
AOR may include genetic testing, and retained samples may be sent to outside laboratories for 
testing.  
Samples retained for AOR will be used for research only, will not be sold, and will not be identified using subject names or other personal identifiers.  
FFPE tissue blocks from biopsies used for screening and on study biopsies or radical prostatectomy may be requested by the sponsor for genomic analysis of prostate cancer 
progression risk.  
8.13.4 Sample Retention  
Blood or serum samples obtained for clinical laboratory testing from all subjects will be retained 
by the central laboratory for up to 7 days and will then be destroyed.  
Blood or serum samples obtained for immune monitoring, or manufacturing process samples for sipuleucel -T product parameters and characterization will be retained for up to 5 years 
following sponsor ’s completion of the trial and will then be destroyed.  Subjects who consent 
to AOR agree for the sponsor to retain the samples indefinitely . 
Samples o btained or used for immune monitoring and sipuleucel -T product parameters and 
characterization from subjects who provide consent for AOR may be retained indefinitely.  
FFPE tissue blocks obtained for IHC and genomic analysis will be returned to the sites.  
9.0 SAFETY  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical 
studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide.   Safety reporting for t his trial will be conducted 
in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 as amended by the Final Rule published September 29, 2010 and detailed in the Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies (December 2012).  S ponsor  will be the final arbiter, should a 
difference of opinion exist regarding the nature, seriousness, severity, or relatedness of AEs.  
9.1 Adverse Events  
9.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject while participating in a study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with sipuleucel -T.  An AE can, therefore, 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 57 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  disease temporally associated with sipuleucel -T, whether or not considered related to 
sipuleucel -T.  AEs include exacerbation of a pre -existing illness, an increase in frequency or 
intensity of a pre -existing episodic event or condit ion, a condition detected or diagnosed after 
product administration (even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study) or 
a continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at Screening  that worsen following the start 
of the study.  
9.1.2 Categories for Ranking Severity of Adverse Events  
The most current version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) will be used to score AE severity by grades.  In general, the following severity definitions  apply:  
Mild (grade 1):  The AE results in mild, easily tolerated symptoms, or is asymptomatic with clinical or diagnostic observations only.  Intervention is not usually indicated.  
Moderate (grade 2):  The AE produces moderate symptoms with discomfort sufficient to interfere with some aspect of the subject’s normal daily activity.  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is required.  
Severe (grade 3):  The AE is medically significant but not immediately life threatening, results in discomfort or dis ability which is 
incapacitating and prevents most normal daily activities, clearly damaging to the health, requiring hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization or complicated treatment.  
Life-threatening (grade 4):  The AE could reasonably be  expected to result in death 
unless immediate medical intervention is undertaken.  
Fatal (grade 5):  The AE results in death.  
 
9.1.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Sipuleucel -T  
The following categories will be used to determine relationship of AEs to sipuleucel -T: 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 58 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  None:  The AE is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
Possible:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of sipuleucel -T, but could readily have been 
produced by the subject’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant medications administered to the subject . 
Probable:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of sipuleucel -T and could not readily have been 
produced by the subject’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant medications administere d 
to the subject.  
 
9.1.4 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs in the sipuleucel -T arm and control arm will be collected from randomization 
through the subject’s last study visit.  AEs and SAEs  will be reported and recorded in the 
subject’s medical record and entered on their eCRF . 
All AEs and SAEs reported in either the sipuleucel -T or control arms will be followed by the 
investigator until resolution, return to baseline, or the investigator determines that no further 
improvement is expected  until study completion.  The start and stop dates, description, 
seriousness, toxicity, relationship to study treatment, and outcome will be recorded.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse drug experience, subject 
hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  An important medical event that 
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions tha t do not result in subject 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 59 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  9.2.2 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs in the sipuleucel- T arm and control arm from randomization through the subject’s last 
study visit wi ll be reported on sponsor’s SAE Report  Form . 
All SAEs reported in both arms will be followed by the investigator until resolution, return to 
baseline, or the investigator determines that no further improvement is expected until study completion. 
SAEs must be reported to sponsor  or designee within 24 hours of the clinical trial site’s 
awareness of the events by completing the sponsor’s SAE Report Form if they meet the criteria 
described in Section 9.2.1.  If access t o the SAE Report Form is unavailable for any reason, the 
SAE information must be reported to sponsor  or designee within 24 hours by email or facsimile 
and a completed written report using sponsor ’s SAE Report form within 3 business days to:

Significant new information regarding each SAE must be reported to sponsor  or designee by 
recording the information on the SAE R eport Form within 24 hours  of the clinical trial site’s 
awareness of the new information and reported as noted above. 
9.2.3 Death Reports   
Deaths that occur during the study will be reported as SAEs and will be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record , sponsor’s  SAE Report Form  and on the e CRF . 
9.2.4 Expedited Reporting Requirements  
Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory authorities and all participating Principal 
Investigators of any AE that is serious, unexpected and considered to be at least possibly related to sipuleucel -T.  Such notification will be provided within 15 calendar days after Sponsor or 
designee’s initial receipt of the information.  If such an event is fatal or life -threatening, the 
appropriate regulatory authorities will be notified no later than 7 calendar days after Sponsor or designee’s  initial receipt of the information.  
Serious adverse events that are expected, such as disease progression, will not be reported by sponsor on an expedited basis.  See the sipuleucel -T Investigator’s Brochure for additional 
information regarding expected SAEs. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for notifying the relevant IRB of any SAE that occurs in a subject participating at their clinical trial site or any IND Safety Reports issued by sponsor , 
unless otherwise instru cted by relevant IRB policy.

PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 60 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  9.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities  
The following laboratory abnormalities will be considered AEs and recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and on the e CRF : 
• Any clinically significant result that is not part of another repo rted clinical diagnosis  
• Any result that meets the definition of an SAE  
• Any result leading to discontinuation or interruption of sipuleucel -T 
• Any result that requires therapeutic intervention or a change in subject management  
Laboratory abnormalities that do not meet the above conditions will not be recorded on the eCRF . 
10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
The Phase 3, open- label  study is designed to assess the effects of sipuleucel -T in subjects on 
AS.  Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to either a sipuleucel -T arm (investigational arm) or a 
control  arm, stratified by the ISUP Grade Group 1 or 2 and the number of biopsies showing the 
presence of disease prior to registration.  Data will be analyzed by arm under the intent- to-treat 
(ITT ) principle.  Generally  statistical tests will be performed at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance 
level unless otherwise noted.  
The phrases ‘statistical analysis’ or ‘analysis’ will be used to mean inferential analysis (such as 
performing tests of significance , reporting p- values and confidence intervals).  When no 
inferential analysis will be performed, the phrases ‘descriptive analysis’ or ‘descriptive 
statistics’ will be used (for instance, producing summary tables of means, standard deviations, percentages of responders).   
Statistical analysis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor.  A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety data is outlined below.  Details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
10.1 Sample Size Considerations  
The primary endpoint will analyze a pproximately 450 subjects randomized (2:1 sipuleucel -T 
versus control arm ), and for each subject , is dichotomous with success defined as having been 
observed to be free of histopathologic  upgrade after 36 months  of follow -up.  Based on data 
available, it is estimated that the proportion of histopathologic  upgrading by 36 months  
following randomization for control  arm subjects will be approximately 0.30.  While there is no 
prior information on treatment response to sipuleucel -T in early stage disease available, a 
meaningful hypothesized reduction in this proportion is a reduction by 0.14, giving a projec ted 
outcome proportion of upgrading in the sipuleucel -T arm of 0.16.  The null hypothesis of both 
arms having a proportion of 0.70 (= 1-  0.3) being free from upgrading at 36 months  versus the 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 61 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  specific alternative hypothesis of a sipuleucel -T arm outcome of  0.84 (= 1-  0.16).  The odds 
ratio associated with the specific alternative hypothesis is 2.25 ( sipuleucel -T arm odds over 
control arm odds).  Based on an overall 1- sided alpha of 0.025 approximately 300 subjects in 
the sipuleucel -T arm and 150 subjects in the control  arm will provide 90% power to demonstrate 
the superiority of sipuleucel -T to control . 
10.2 Analysis  Populations  
The Safety Analysis Population is defined as all randomized patients; the Sipuleucel -T safety 
population must have begun the treatment process.  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as the subset of patients in the ITT population who 
have completed all assessment per the protocol.    
10.3 Efficacy  Analysis  
The phr ases ‘statistical analysis’ or ‘analysis’ will be used to mean inferential analysis (such as 
performing tests of significance, reporting p- values and confidence intervals).  When no 
inferential analysis will be performed, the phrases ‘descriptive analysis’  or ‘descriptive 
statistics’ will be used (for instance, producing summary tables of means, standard deviations, percentages of responders).  All efficacy analyses will be conducted on  the ITT population and 
the per protocol population.  
Unless otherwise specified, the statistical tests are based on the superiority hypothesis using a one-sided p -value of 0.025 (equivalent to two- sided 0.05 with a result in the hypothesized 
direction).  The final analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed t he 36 month 
biopsy, or have histopathologic upgrade or have withdrawn from the study.   
10.4 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is proposed. 
10.5 Analysis of Study Endpoints  
10.5.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with out a histopathologic  upgrade over the 
36-months following randomization and will be summarized by study arm.  The primary 
endpoint for each subject  is dichotomous with success defined as having been observed to be 
free of histopathologic  upgrade  at Biopsy 2  33 to 39  months  after randomization.  
Histopathologic  upgrading occurs when a subject with ISUP Grade Group 1 prostate cancer, at 
randomization, is upgraded to Grade Group 2 or higher, or a subject with ISUP Grade Group 2 
prostate cancer, at randomization, is upgraded to Grade 3 or higher as determined by BICR, at 
any post -randomization biopsy.  Histopathologic  status is determined by biopsy and will be 
assessed at the scheduled biopsy or at any biopsy that is taken during radical -prostatectomy or 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 62 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  other time -point.  Subjects upgrading  before 36 months , or those found as upstaged at Biopsy 
2, or those not observed at 36 months  (i.e., do not complete Biopsy 2 prior to 39 months post 
randomization) will be regarded as failures in the primary analysis.  
The primary  analysis null hypothesis, H0: Ω ≤ 1, versus the alternative hypothesis, HA: Ω > 1; 
where Ω is the odds of success in the sipuleucel -T arm over the odds of success in the control 
arm.  The Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by ISUP Grade Group 1 or 2 and 
the number of biopsies showing the presence of disease prior to registration will be used to 
estimate the odds ratio, and will be computed using exact methods based on Monte Carlo computations due to the potential for small frequencies.  
10.5.2 Secondar y Endpoints  
The subsequent prostate cancer treatment, if any, for each subject will be determined.  The category of subsequent prostate cancer treatment will be identified (e.g., surgery, radiation, androgen deprivation therapy).  Subjects  initiating alternative intervention will be regarded as 
sipuleucel -T treatment failure s.  These data will be summarized descriptively and compared 
between study arms using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel  test.  
Quality of life data will be summarized descripti vely and compared between study treatment 
arms and in the aggregate within the efficacy population.  
Safety data will be summarized descriptively by study treatment arms and in the aggregate within the safety population. 
10.5.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
Immune response will be assessed at each specified time- point.  Immune response variables will 
be evaluated to determine if there is a correlation between the measures of immune response and upgrade or other changes t o the ISUP group grade of the subjec t’s prostate can cer.   
Subjects undergoing a radical prostatectomy will have the biopsy sample evaluated for 
histological status of the prostate cancer.  Histopathologic  change will be defined as any change 
in ISUP grade at baseline to an upgrade, no change in, or down- grade to a their ISUP baseline 
grade group  designation , or to a status indicating no prostate cancer disease identified.  These 
data will be summarized descriptively and compared between study arms.   
Biopsy results will be assessed to determine the rate of negative biopsy results.  This data will 
be summarized descriptively and compared between study arms.  
PSA velocity will be calculated as the slope of the simple linear regression of the natural log of 
PSA versus time.  
10.5.4 Biomarker Analysis  
The association of biomarkers with clinical response endpoints or survival may be assessed using appropriate statistical methods (e.g., analysis of variance [ANOVA], categorical or 
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 63 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  survival models) depending on the endpoints.  Other clinical covariates (such as baseline t umor 
characteristics and subject  demographics) may also be included in the model.  Association of 
biomarkers with clinical response or relevant time- to-event endpoints will also be explored in 
the overall population.  Results of these exploratory analyses will be presented in separate 
technical reports.  
10.5.5 Safety  
The safety parameters to be analyzed are the incidence, intensity, and type of AEs, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory results, and limited physical examinations (abnormalities will be recorded as AEs (Section 9.3).  Analysis of the safety parameters will be conducted on the safety population. 
10.5.5.1 Adverse Events  
AEs will be summarized and listed using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA version 18.0 or later ) by preferred term within each body system.  Tables to be 
produced will include the number and incidence of the following:  
• Incidence within system organ class  
• Incidence by decreasing frequency  
• Incidence by NCI CTCAE ( most current version) severity grade, by decreasing 
frequency  
• Incidence within 1 day of infusion  
• Incidence of SAEs  
• Incidence of AEs that resulted in premature discontinuation of study  
AEs that occur multiple times for a subject will be counted only once per subject in incidence 
summary tables.  In tables that enumerate AEs by severity, only the greatest severity for an AE 
occurring multiple times for a subject will be counted.  
10.5.5.2 Clinical Lab oratory Data 
Clinical laboratory test results will be summarized by type of laboratory test.   For continuous 
measurements, descriptive statistics will be calculated at baseline and for observed values and 
changes from baseline at each scheduled time point.   The number and percentage of subjects 
with abnormal values will be summarized.  The number and percentage of subjects with 
parameters with NCI -CTCAE toxicity Grade of ≥3 will be summarized.  Shift in toxicity grade 
from baseline to the worst grade experi enced by the subject during the study will be provided.  
10.5.5.3 Other Clinical Assessments  
Descriptive statistics of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) values and changes from baseline will be summarized at each scheduled time point.  Descriptive statistics o f other vital signs

  Proprietary and Confidential  (body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate) at baseline will also be summarized.  The number 
and percentage of subjects with values beyond clinically important limits will be summarized.  
Abnormal findings in physical examination wi ll be recorded and summarized as AEs.  Weight 
will be summarized and DRE results will be provided in a listing.  
10.5.6 Other  
10.5.6.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

11.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Study Materials  
Sponsor  or designee will provide an approved protocol and any requir ed amendments or 
administrative letters, the current Investigator’s Brochure , and the eCRF .  Dendreon or designee 
will also provide leukapheresis services at a Dendreon -qualified leukapheresis center and all 
applicable study- specific training materials and  reference binders.  Sponsor  or designee will 
additionally provide materials needed for the collection and shipment of laboratory samples, including samples for immune monitoring.  
The clinical trial site will provide all other supplies required to conduct the study at the clinical trial site.  
11.2 Study Documentation 
The Principal Investigator and clinical trial site personnel are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and centralized filing system containing all study- related documentation.  These 
files must be suitable for inspection by Dendreon or designee, IRBs, FDA, or other regulatory 
authorities at any time, and should consist of the following:  
• Copies of completed e CRF s 
• Subject files, containing supporting source documentation from the subject’s medical record, including clinical laboratory data, pathology reports, and the original signed ICF  
(including any updated ICFs requiring re -consenting)  
• Essential documents, as defined in ICH E6 Guideline for GCP  
• Drug accountability files, containing a complet e account of the receipt and disposition 
of all sipuleucel -T infusions  
The Principal Investigator shall retain records for a period of 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or the application is not approved for such 
indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified.

PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 66 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  11.3 Protocol Compliance  
To ensure accurate interpretation and implementation of th e study, the protocol will be carefully 
reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the clinical trial site personnel prior to study 
initiation.  
Any non- adherence to the protocol, FDA regulations, or GCP will be considered a protocol 
deviation, and will be discussed during a monitoring visit and documented via a visit follow -up 
letter.  The Principal Investigator will be responsible for reporting protocol deviations to the IRB per the IRB’s reporting requirements.  
A protocol exception is a specific type of protocol deviation wherein a subject does not meet eligibility requirements for the study, but a waiver allowing the subject to enter the study is prospectively granted by sponsor .  Protocol exceptions are rarely considered, and are granted 
only when a subj ect’s participation will not confound analysis or interpretation of safety data.  
11.4 Monitoring  
A sponsor  monitor or designee will visit the clinical trial site periodically to monitor adherence 
to the protocol, adherence to applicable FDA regulations, adherence to ICH E6 Guideline for GCP, and the maintenance of adequate and accurate records.  Electronic c ase report forms will 
be reviewed to ensure that key safety and efficacy data are reported as specified by the protocol.  The sponsor  monitor or designee must be permitted to access subjects’ complete medical 
records, laboratory data, and other source docume ntation as needed to appropriately monitor the 
trial. 
In addition to monitoring visits to the site, site management contacts (via phone/email) will be scheduled with the site to review study -related topics, such as, enrollment status, study staff 
training/ turnover, safety reporting, data entry and query resolution, regulatory documentation 
status, study materials/expiration status, and principal investigator oversight. Frequency of these site contacts varies depending on phase of the study (approximately we ekly during enrollment 
& closeout, and monthly during maintenance).  
11.5 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be established to provide safety oversight for this study.  
The primary role of the IDMC will be  to monitor ongoing safety data, provide recommendations 
to sponsor  executive management to protect the safety of study subjects.  The IDMC members 
will be required to attend meetings on a regular basis.  The IDMC will be completely 
independent from sponsor  and study personnel.  As part of the ongoing safety monitoring 
activities, the IDMC will have access to comparative results of safety and efficacy data (if necessary), aggregated by study arm.  
P17-1 (ProVent) Protocol  
PR-2677.02 , 25 January 2019   Page 67 of 78 Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  
  Proprietary and Confidential  The IDMC review of safety data will be conducted after the f irst 30 subjects have completed 
sipuleucel -T treatment.  Safety reviews will then be conducted approximately every 6 months 
during subject enrollment period  and then annually until the last subject completes Biopsy 2 .  
Study enrollment will not be suspende d during IDMC review periods.  
11.6 Quality Assurance  
A sponsor  Quality Assurance auditor or designee may arrange and conduct visits to the clinical 
trial site to audit the performance of the study and the study documents originating at the site.  
The Principal  Investigator will be informed of the outcome of audits.  
In addition, inspections by FDA, other regulatory authorities, or the IRB are possible at any time.  The Principal Investigator must inform sponsor  of any such inspection immediately.  
The clinical trial site must provide direct access to source documentation and subjects’ medical 
records for audits and inspections.  
11.7 Steering Committee  
The Steering Committee will be comprised of independent experts in the treatment of prostate cancer.  The Steering Co mmittee will consult and advise regarding study design, protocol 
development and amendments, data analysis and interpretation, and scientific publications.   
11.8 Disclosure of Data and Publication  
Publications and presentations proposed by clinical trial site personnel and/or principal investigator will be furnished to sponsor  for review and comment pursuant to the terms of the 
clinical study agreement between the clinical trial site and sponsor .

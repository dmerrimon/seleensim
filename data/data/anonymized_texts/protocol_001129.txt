1 Introduction 
The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) is to describe the statistical methods for all 
safety and efficacy analyses planned to be included for the clinical study report (CSR) of 
study CAMN107AUS37 (A phase II randomized, multicenter study of treatment-free 
remission in chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) patients who achieve and 
sustain MR4.5 after switching to nilotinib). 
The
 content of this SAP is based on protocol CAMN107AUS37  Amendment Version 04. All  
decisions regarding final analysis, as defined in the SAP document, have been made prior to 
database lock of the study data. 
 
The
 planned analysis identified in this SAP may be included in clinical study reports (CSRs), 
regulatory submissions, conference submissions or future manuscripts.  
 
 
I
n addition to the study protocol, the following documents were reviewed in preparation of 
this SAP: 
• Electronic case report form (eCRF) for Protocol CAMN107AUS37 
• ICH Guidance on Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (E9) 
1.1 Study D esign  
This is an open-label study of imatinib treated patients who are switched to nilotinib and their 
ability to discontinue TKI treatment once a confirmed MR4.5 is achieved and sustained 
MR4.0 or better for 2 years. 
 
 
Monitoring Phase (Years 1 and 2) 
Fifty-nine patients have been enrolled and were switched from imatinib to nilotinib 300 mg 
b.i.d. upon study entry. Patients will be monitored every 3 months for molecular response for 
up to 2 years. 
If during the Monitoring Phase, a patient has a PCR result demonstrating a loss of MR3.0, a 
subsequent unscheduled visit peripheral blood sample for PCR must be collected within 4 
weeks of the most recent sample. If loss of MR3.0 is confirmed, the patient will not be 
eligible for subsequent phases and will early terminate from the study. Patients who achieve a 

Novartis Confidential  Page 8 
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
MR4.5 will have the result confirmed by another sample drawn 4-6 weeks later. Once MR4.5 
is conf
irmed, patients will then enter the Consolidation Phase. 
Consolidation Phase 
Patients can enter the Consolidation Phase anytime during and up to the first 2 years on study, 
as soon as MR4.5 is confirmed. After confirmation of MR4.5, the date of the initial MR4.5 
results will be counted as the start of the Consolidation Phase. Patients will continue to be 
treated with nilotinib for 2 years during the Consolidation Phase. 
If during the Consolidation Phase, a patient has one PCR result above MR4.0 or a sample is 
missing, a subsequent unscheduled visit peripheral blood sample for PCR must be collected 
within 4 weeks of the most recent sample. If loss of MR4.0 is confirmed by the subsequent 
sample, the patient will not be eligible for nilotinib discontinuation and will early terminate 
from the study. 
Treatment-Free Remission (TFR) Phase 
The Treatment-Free Remission Phase will begin after the last scheduled PCR sample 
collected in the Consolidation Phase confirms the patient remains in MR4.0 or better.  
During the TFR phase patients will be monitored for two years. Once nilotinib treatment is 
stopped in the TFR Phase, patients will be followed by PCR every month for the first 6 
months, then every 2 months for the next 18 months. Confirmed loss of MMR (BCR-
ABL>0.1%IS) will trigger restarting nilotinib. 
Nilotinib Treatment Reinitiation (NTRI) Phase 
Patients who re-initiate nilotinib during the TFR Phase will be monitored by PCR once a 
month for the first 3 months, and then every 3 months until they reach 2 years from the start 
date of their TFR Phase. For patients who need to re-initiate nilotinib with less than a year left 
of their TFR Phase, they will be followed for one year in the Nilotinib Treatment Re-initiation 
Phase. 
1.2 Open Study and Blinded Data 
This study is an open label, single arm study where investigators, patients and Novartis 
employees involved in the analyses have full knowledge of the treatment allocation. 
1.3 Interim 
and Final Analysis  
No interim analysis will be performed for this study. 
The primary analyses of all efficacy and safety variables will be performed when all patients 
enrolled have completed 6 months of the TFR Phase, follow-up or discontinued from the 
study
. All analyses will include patients who entered the TFR Phase following a 12 month 
Consolidation Phase (Arm A) prior to protocol amendment 2 and a 24 month Consolidation 
Phase (formerly Arm B). 
 
After all patients enrolled have completed 12 and 24 months of follow-up, analyses of all 
efficacy and safety will be performed including the same patients as in the primary analyses. 
These analyses performed after the primary analyses will be considered secondary. No formal 
Novartis Confidential  Page 9 
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
testing of any kind will be performed at these analyses.

2 Statistical Methods 
2.1 Data Analysis General Information 
The final analysis will be performed .  No interim analysis will be 
performed for this study.  SAS version 9.3 or later software will be used to perform all data 
analyses and to generated tables, figures, and listings. 
2.1.1 Data Included in the Analysis 
The analysis cut-off date for the primary analysis of all study data will be established after all 
enrolled patients have completed 6 months of the TFR Phase, follow-up or discontinued 
from the study. A ll statistical analy ses will be performed using all da ta collec ted  in the 
da
tabase up to  the data cutoff date. All data with an assessment date or event start date (e.g. 
vital sign assessment date or start date of an adverse event) prior to or on the cut-off date 
will
 be included in the analysis. Any data collected bey ond the cut-off date will not be 
included in the analysis and will not be used for any derivations. 
All eve
nts with start date before or on the cut-off date and end date after the cut-off date will 
be reported as ‘ongoing. The same rule will be applied to events starting before or on the cut-
off date and not having documented end date. This approach applies, in particular, to adverse 
event and concomitant medication reports. For these events, the end date will not be imputed 
a
nd therefore will not appear in the listings. 
The analysis cut-off date for the secondary final analysis will be established after all enrolled 
patients have completed 12 and 24 months of follow-up, all efficacy and safety analyses will 
be performed. All analyses will be performed using all data collected in the database up to the 
data cutoff date for this secondary set of analyses. The same above rules regarding assessment 
dates will apply for this analysis. 
2.1.2 General Analysis Conventions 
Qualitative data (e.g., gender, race, etc.) will be summarized by means of contingency tables 
b
y overall patients; a missing category will be included as applicable. Percentages will be 
c
alculated using the number of patients in the relevant population or subgroup as the 
denominator. Percentages will be rounded to 1 decimal place 
Quantit
ative data (e.g., age, body weight, etc.) will be summarized by appropriate 
descriptiv
e statistics (i.e. mean, standard deviation, median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, 
minimum, and maximum) by overall patients. The number of decimal places for the minimum 
a
nd maximum will be based on the maximum number of decimal places of the data.  One 
additional decimal place will be used to summarize the mean, median, 25th percentile, and 75th 
percentile.  Two additional decimal places will be used to summarize the standard deviation.  
A maximum of 2 decimal places for the mean and 3 decimal places for the standard deviation 
will be used. 
All data
 collected on the CRF will be listed.  In general, there will be one listing per CRF 
page, but additional listings could be produced if necessary.

2.1.3 General Definitions  
2.1.3.1 Investigational Drug and Study Treatment 
Investigational drug , and stu dy treatment will refer to nilotinib (AMN107, Tasigna)  only.  
No control treatment is administered in this study.  
2.1.3.2 Date of First Administration of Investigational Drug 
The date of first administration of investigational drug is defined as the first date when a non-
zero dose of investigational drug is administered and recorded on the Dosage Administration 
Record (DAR) (e)CRF. The date of first administration of study drug will also be referred as 
start of investigational drug. 
2
.1.3.3 Date of Last Administration of Investigational Drug 
The date of last administration of investigational drug is defined as is the last date when a 
nonzero dose of investigational drug is administered and recorded on DAR eCRF. The date of 
last administration of investigational drug will also be referred as end of investigational drug. 
2
.1.3.4 Date of First Administration of Study Treatment  
The date of first administration of study treatment is the same as the date of first 
administration of investigational drug.  
2.1.3.5 Date of Last Administration of Study Treatment  
The date of last administration of study treatment is the same as the date of last administration 
of investigational drug. 
2.1.3.6 Study D ay 
The study day, describes the day of the event or assessment date, relative to the reference start 
da
te.  
The study day is defined as: 
 The date of the event (visit date, onset date of an event, assessment date etc.) − 
refe
rence start date + 1 if event is on or after the reference start date; 
 The date of the event (visit date, onset date of an event, assessment date etc.) − 
re
ference start date if event precedes the reference start date. 
The reference date for all assessments (safety, efficacy, pk, QoL/PRO, etc) is the start of 
study treatment.  
2.1.3.7 Time unit 
A year length is defined as 365.25 days. A month length is 30.5 days. If duration is reported in 
mont
hs, duration in days will be divided by 30.5.  If duration is  reported in years, duration in 
da
ys will be divided by 365.25. 
Novartis Confidential  Page 12  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
2.1.3.8 Baseline 
This study has multiple baselines for different phases of the study. 
For safety and efficacy evaluations, the last available assessment on or before the date of start 
of study treatment is defined as “baseline” assessment.  In the rare case that time of 
assessment and time of treatment start is captured, the last available assessment before the 
treatment start date/time is used for baseline. 
In addition to the above baseline for the monitoring phase at the start of the study, three 
additional baselines will be used for analyses regarding reporting a change from baseline in 
phase (e.g. shift tables): 
 M onitoring Phase baseline : is defined above. 
 Cons olidation Phase baseline:  last available assessment before the first dose date of 
the consolidation phase. 
 T reatment-Free Remission phase (TFR) baseline:  last available assessment before 
the first day of the TFR phase. 
 Nilotinib Treatment Reinitiation phase (NTRI) baseline:   last available assessment 
before the first dose date of the NTRI phase. 
If patients have no value as defined above for the baseline within a given study phase, the 
baseline result will be missing. 
2.1.3.9 On-treatment assessment/event and observation periods  
For adverse event (AE) reporting,  the overall observation period will be divided into mutually 
exclusive segments:  
 P re-treatment period : any day prior to a patient’s first dose of study drug during the 
monitoring phase 
 Monitoring phase : from date of first administration of study treatment until the day a 
patient enters the consolidation phase. Patients enter the consolidation phase after two 
consecutive BCR-ABL levels ≤ 0.0032%.  The day of the first measurement is the 
start of the consolidation phase. 
 Cons olidation phase : from date of first administration of study treatment during the 
consolidation phase to the date the last scheduled PCR sample collected in the 
consolidation phase confirms the patient remains in MR4.0 or better. 
 T reatment-Free Remission (TFR) phase:  from the day after the date the last 
scheduled PCR sample in the consolidation phase confirms a patient remains in 
MR4.0 or better to one of the following: 
o the day of the last scheduled visit during the TFR phase for patients that 
maintain MMR throughout the TFR phase 
o the day a scheduled PCR sample shows a confirmed loss of MMR for patients 
who re-start study treatment 
Novartis Confidential  Page 13  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
 Nilotinib Treatment Reinitiation (NTRI) phase:  from the day after a scheduled 
PCR sample shows a confirmed loss of MMR during the TFR phase until the last 
scheduled  visit during the NTRI phase. 
 F ollow-up period:  The follow-up period can have three possible start dates. 
o F or patients who maintain MMR throughout the TFR phase, the follow-up 
period begins the day after the last scheduled visit in the TFR phase. 
o F or patients who enter into the NTRI phase, the follow-up period begins the 
day after the last scheduled visit in the NTRI phas e. 
o F or patients who discontinue from the study early, the follow-up period begins 
the day after discontinuation. 
The follow-up period lasts until the last follow-up visit in the study.  If a subject does not 
ha
ve any follow-up visits, the follow-up period ends 30 days after the start of the follow-
up period. 
2.1.3.10 Last contact date  
The last contact date will be derived for patients not known to have died at the analysis cut-off 
using the last complete date among the following: 
 
Table 2-1 Last contact date data sources  
Source data  Conditions  
Last contact date/last date patient was known to 
be alive from Survival Follow -up page  
 Patient status is reported to be alive, lost to 
follow -up or unknown.  
Start/End* dates from drug administration record  
 Non-missing dose. Doses of 0 are allowed.  
End of treatment date from end of treatment page  
 No condition.  
Any efficacy assessment date if available  Evaluation is marked as ‘done’.  
Laboratory/PK collection dates  
 Sample collection marked as ‘done’.  
Vital signs date  
 At least one non -missing parameter value  
ECOG Performance Status date  
 Non-missing performance status  
Start/End dates of AE  Non-missing verbatim term  
The last contact date is defined as the latest complete date from the above list on or before 
the data cut-off date . The cut-off date will not be used for last contact date, unless the patient 
was seen or contacted on  that date. No date post cut-off date will be used. Completely 
im
puted dates (e.g. the analy sis cut- off date programmatically imputed to replace the 
missing end date of a dose administration record) will not be used to derive the last contact 
Novartis Confidential  Page 14  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
date. Partial date imputation is allowed for event (death)/censoring is coming from ‘Survival 
information’ eCRF.  
The last contact date will be used for censoring of patients in the analysis of overall survival. 
2.1.3.11 Withdrawal of Informed Consent 
Any data collected in the clinical database after a subject withdraws informed consent from all 
further participation in the trial will not be included in the analysis.  The date on which a 
patient withdraws full consent or completes the study is recorded in the eCRF. 
2.2 
Analysis Sets 
2.2.1.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
The Full Analysis Set for the primary analysis comprises all patients who entered the TFR 
Phase. 
The FAS will be the primary set for all efficacy analyses and safety analyses in the TFR Phase 
only. 
2.2.1.2 Safety Set (SS)  
The safety set consists of all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug and had at 
least one post-baseline safety assessment after enrollment. 
The statement that a patient had no adverse events (on the Adverse Event eCRF) constitutes a 
safety assessment.   
Safety analyses will be presented by phase and visit within phase where applicable. 
The safety set will be used for all safety and patient reported outcomes in the monitoring and 
consolidation phase. 
2.2.1.3 Per-Protocol Set 
No per-protocol set is defined for this study. 
2.3 Patient Dispo
sition, Demographics and Other Baseline 
Characteristics 
The FAS and SS will be used for these all disposition, demographics, and baseline 
characteristics analyses.  Separate tables will be produced for the two analysis sets. 
All 
demographic and baseline disease characteristics data will be summarized and listed by 
overall patients.  Categorical data will be summarized by frequency counts and percentages;.  
Continuous data will be summarized by descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, 
media
n, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, minimum, and maximum). 
2.3.1 Patient Disposition 
The number of patients enrolled, randomized,  and in the safety set will be summarized. 
Novartis Confidential  Page 15  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
The number and percentage of patients who entered in the different phases of the study, 
discontinued treatment, discontinued the study, and the study phase in which discontinuation 
occurred will be summarized.   
Patient disposition information will be summarized for the SS and FAS. 
2
.3.2 Protocol Deviations 
The number of patients with major and minor protocol deviations will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages by type of deviation for the SS and FAS. 
2.3.3 Background and Demographic Characteristics 
The following demographic and other baseline data will be summarized for the SS and FAS: 
 Age  (years) 
 Ge nder 
 R ace 
 S creening ECOG Status 
 P rior therapy types 
Sokal risk score at time of CML diagnosis will be summarized categorically using low, 
intermediate, and high categories.   If a subject does not have a classification collected on the 
Sokal risk score relative risk will be derived using the below formula (Sokal, et al 1984).   
Relative 
risk = exp{0.0116*(age(yrs) – 43.4) + 0.0345*(spleen(cm) – 7.51) + 
0.188*[
(platelets(x10^9L)/700)^2 – 0.563] + 0.0887*(myeloblasts(%) – 2.10) 
 Age  is the age in years collected on the demography eCRF page at screening 
 Spleen is the distance in cm between the spleen and costal margin at screening 
 P latelates are collected in the laboratory data at screening 
 M yeloblasts are collected in the laboratory data at screening 
High, intermediate, and low Sokal risk scores are defined as follows: 
 Low risk patients have a relative risk < 0.8 
 Intermediate riks patients have relative risk ≥ 0.8 and ≤ 1.2 
 High risk patients have relative risk > 1.2 
Prior Imatinib Treatment duration will be summarized. Prior Imatinib treatment information 
will be obtained from the prior antineoplastic therapy data collected. Medications identified as 
Imatinib or Gleevac will be used for this summary. Partial date imputation rules will be used 
as specified in section 2.4.2.

.4.1.1 Duration of Exposure to Study Treatment 
Duration of exposure to study treatment is considered by taking into account the duration of 
exposure to the study treatment: 
Dur
ation of exposure to study treatment ( months ) = (date of last administration to study 
treatment ) – (date of first administration of study treatment) + 1/ 30.5.  
Dur
ation of exposure to study treatment ( days) = (date of last administration to study 
treatment ) – (date of first administration of study treatment) + 1.  
S
ummary of duration of exposure of study treatment in months will include continuous 
summaries. 
Duration of exposure will also be summarized for Overall study, Monitoring, Consolidation 
and Nilotinib Reinitaition Phases (if applicable). The duration of exposure to study treatment 
for each phase will use the same above formula with the exception of using last date of 
exposure to study treatment within the specified phase and date of first administration of study 
tre
atment within the specified phase. 
Date of last administration to study treatment  is defined as follows within each study phase: 
 F or non-last study phases and for patients still ongoing on treatment when entering the 
next phase before the data cut-off date, the date of last administration to study 
treatment  is defined as the last date in the study phase. 
 F or the last study phase (in database at data cutoff date) and for patients ongoing on 
treatment, the date of last administration to study treatment  is defined as the earlier 
date of the following two dates: 
Novartis Confidential  Page 17  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
o Da ta cut-off date 
o The  last date of the last available dates reported on the dose administration 
record.  
o F or the last study phase (in database at data cut-off date) and for patients who 
entered post-treatment follow up phase before the data cut-off date, the date of 
last dose is defined as the date of the last non-zero dose of study drug reported 
in the dose administration record CRF page. 
2.4.1.2 Cumulative Dose 
Cumulative dose of a study treatment is defined as the total dose given during the study 
treatment exposure and will be summarized for overall study, Monitoring, Consolidation and 
Nilotinib Reinitaition Phases (if applicable). 
The planned cumulative dose  for a study treatment component refers to the total planned 
dose as per the protocol up to the last date of drug administration.  
The actual  cumulative dose  refers to the total actual dose administered, over the duration for 
which the subject is on the study treatment as documented in the Dose Administration eCRF.  
F
or patients who did not take any drug the cumulative dose is by definition equal to zero. 
F
or continuous dosing, the actual cumulative dose is the sum of the non-zero doses recorded 
over the dosing period and the planned cumulative dose is the planned starting dose summed 
over the same dosing period. 
2.4.1.3 Average Daily Dose 
Average daily dose will be summarized for overall study, Monitoring, Consolidation and 
Nilotinib Reinitaition Phases (if applicable). 
Average daily dose = actual cumulative dose/ Duration of exposure to study treatment ( days). 
2.4.1.4 Dose Intensity and Relative Dose Intensity 
Dose intensity (DI) for patients with non-zero duration of exposure is  defined as follows:  
DI (mg / months) = Actual Cumulative dose ( mg) / Duration of exposure to study treatment 
(months ). 
For patients who did not take any drug the DI is by definition equal to zero.  
Planned dose intensity (PDI)  is defined as follows:  
P
DI (mg / months) = Planned Cumulative dose ( mg) / Duration of exposure (months ) 
Re
lative dose intensity  (RDI)  is defined as follows:  
RDI = DI (mg / months))  / PDI (mg / months) 
DI and RDI  will be summarized for Overall study, Monitoring, Consolidation and Nilotinib 
Reinitaition Phases (if applicable).

SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
2.4.1.5 Dose Reductions, Interruptions or Permanent Discontinuations 
The number of patients who have dose reductions, permanent discontinuations or 
interruptions, and the reasons, will be summarized.  
‘Dose interrupted’, and ‘Dose permanently discontinued’ fields from the Dosage 
Administration CRF  pages (DAR) will be used to determine the dose reductions, dose 
interruptions, and permanent discontinuations, respectively. 
The corresponding fields ‘Reason for dose changes’ will be used to summarize the reasons. 
F
or the purpose of summarizing interruptions and reasons, in case multiple entries for 
interruption that are entered on consecutive days with different reasons will be counted as 
separate interruptions. However, if the reason is the same in this mentioned multiple entries 
on consecutive days, then it will be counted as one interruption.  
Reduction : A dose change where the prescribed dose level is lower than the previous 
prescribed dose level or where the actual dose administered/total daily dose is lower than the 
planned dose . Only dose change is collected in the CRF, number of reductions will be derived 
programmatically  based on the change and the  direction of the change. 
Missing data:  If dose is recorded but regimen is missing or entered as ‘none’, it is assumed 
that the study treatment was taken as per-protocol. 
2.4.2 Prior,  Concomitant and Post Therapies 
2.4
.2.1 Data Handling 
If partial dates occur, the convention for replacing missing dates for the purposes of 
calculating derived variables is as follows: 
For partial start dates: 
 I f the year is unknown, then do not impute the date but assign as missing value. 
 I f the year is known, but month or month and day are unknown, then: 
o I f the year matches the year of of first administration of study treatment, then 
impute the month and day of the of first administration of study treatment. 
o Othe rwise, assign 01 January 
 I f the year and month are known, but day is unknown, then: 
o I f the month and year match the month and year of the of first administration 
of study treatment, then impute the day of the of first administration of study 
treatment. 
o O therwise, assign 01 
For end dates: 
 I f the year is unknown, then do not impute the date but assign a missing value. 
Novartis Confidential  Page 19  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
 If the month is unknown, then assign the last day of the year, 31 December. If this 
results in a date after the of last administration of study treatment, assign the day and 
month of the last administration of study treatment.  
 If the day is unknown, then assign the last day of the month. 
2.4.2.2 Prior Antineoplastic Therapy 
The number and percentage of patients who received any prior anti-neoplastic radiotherapy 
will be summarized. Prior anti-neoplastic therapies will be summarized by therapy type (e.g. 
c
hemotherapy, hormonal therapy etc.), and also by lowest ATC class and preferred term. 
Summaries will also include total number of regimens.  
All 
prior antineoplastic therapy data will be listed. 
Anti-neoplastictherapies will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary (WHO-DD);  Details 
regarding WHO-DD version will be included in the footnote in the tables/listings.  
The above analyses will be performed using the safety set. 
2
.4.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medications/significant non-drug therapies will be listed and 
summarized for the safety set. 
Me
dications will be classified as prior or concomitant based on the following rules: 
 Prior medications are medications that started before the first dose of study drug 
regardless of whether the medication ended before or after the first dose of study drug 
 Concomitant medications are medications that started on or after the first dose of study 
drug, or started before the first dose of study drug and continued after the first dose of 
study drug. 
o Me dications starting on or after the start of study treatment but no later than 30 
days after start of last dose of study treatment and 
o Me dications starting prior to start of study treatment and continuing after the 
start of study treatment 
The number and percentage of patients with prior and concomitant medication will be 
presented separately by ATC class and preferred term according to the WHO DRL dictionary. 
Any concomitant medication starting and ending prior to the start of study treatment or 
star
ting more than 30 days after the  last date of study treatment will be flagged in the listing.  
2.5 Efficacy Evaluation 
2.5.1 Definition of Efficacy Variables 
2.5.1.1 Molecular Response 
Molecular response will be assessed in all patients. Levels of BCR-ABL transcripts will be 
determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) testing of peripheral blood. The samples 
Novartis Confidential  Page 20  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
will be sent to a Novartis designated central laboratory with validated PCR technology that 
has a sensitivity of at least 4.5 logs to evaluate BCR-ABL transcript levels by RQ-PCR. The 
percent ratio of BCR-ABL transcripts versus control gene transcripts converted to IS will be 
calculated for each sample. 
Molecular response and related variables are defined as the following: 
 M ajor molecular response (MMR) 
Major molecular response is defined as a value of ≤ 0.1% of BCR-ABL ratio on the 
International Scale (IS). For statistical comparison purpose, MMR will be considered 
as a binary variable with patients achieving MMR grouped as ‘responders’ and 
patients not achieving MMR, patients with missing PCR evaluations grouped as ‘non-
responders’. 
 L oss of a major molecular response (MMR) is defined as a BCR-ABL ratio > 0.1%  
 M olecular response 4.0  (MR4.0) 
MR
4 is defined as a value of ≤ 0.01% of BCR-ABL ratio on the International Scale 
(IS).  
 L oss of MR4 .0 is defined as a BCR-ABL ratio > 0.01% (on international scale ). 
 Conf irm ed Loss of MR4.0  is defined as is two consecutive BCR-ABL > 0.01% IS 
after the achievement of MR4.0. 
 M olecular response 4.5 (MR4.5) 
MR4.5 is defined as a value of ≤ 0.0032% of BCR-ABL ratio on the International 
Scale (IS).  
 L oss of MR4.5 is defined as a BCR-ABL ratio > 0.0032% (on international scale) 
 Conf irm ed Loss of MR4.5  is defined as two consecutive BCR-ABL > 0.0032% IS 
after the achievement of MR4.5. 
 M olecular Relapse  is defined as having two consecutive BCR-ABL levels >0.1%. 
2.5.1.2 Relapse- Free Survival (RFS) 
Relapse-free survival is defined as time in months from date of cessation of nilotinib therapy 
(date of entering TFR phase) to the first documented molecular relapse.  The duration will be 
c
alculated by (date of first document molecular relapse – date of nilotinib treatment 
disconti
nuation + 1)/30.5.  Molecular relapse is defined as having a confirmed BCR-ABL 
ratio above MMR (2 consecutive BCR-ABL levels >0.1%IS taken approximately 4 weeks 
apart) variable 
If a patient does not experience molecular relapse after nilotinib treatment discontinuation the 
relapse-free survival time will be considered censored at the following duration: (date of last 
RQ-PCR sample prior to treatment discontinuation – date of nilotinib treatment 
disconti
nuation + 1)/30.5. 
This analysis will be performed on the FAS. 
Novartis Confidential  Page 21  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
2.5.1.3 Overall Survival (OS) 
Overall survival  is defined as the time in months from the date of cessation of nilotinib 
therapy (date of entering TFR phase) to the date of death from any cause at any time during 
the study, including the follow-up period after discontinuation of study up to cut-off date. 
For patients who do not have events on or before the cut-off date, the time will be censored at 
the 
date of last assessment (from the list of sources specified below) for patients who are still 
in study before the follow-up period and at the date of last contact for patients who are in the 
follow-up period after early discontinuation of study (from the End of Treatment CRF page). 
Specific last assessment date sources for this study are: 
 P CR (RQ-PCR) testing of peripheral blood sample dates  
 S tart/End dates from drug administration record with non-missing total daily dose 
 L aboratory/PK collection dates  
 Vital si gns date with at least one non-missing measurement 
 ECOG pe rformance status date 
 S tart/End dates of AE with non-missing AE name 
This analysis will be performed on the FAS. 
2.5.1.4 Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
Progression free survival is defined as the time in months from the date of cessation of 
nilotinib therapy (date of entering TFR phase) to the date of progression at any time after the 
start of the TFR phase.  Progression is defined as the first reported progression to accelerated 
phase (AP) or blast crisis (BC) as reported on the disease response eCRF after the start of the 
TFR phase.  The duration will be calculated by (date of first documented progression – date of 
nil
otinib treatment discontinuation + 1)/30.5.  If a subject does not experience progression 
after the start of the TFR phase, they will be censored at their last AP or BC assessment. 
2.5.1.5 Treatment Free Survival (TFS) 
Treatment free survival is defined as the time in months from the cessation of nilotinib 
therapy (date of entering TFR phase) to the date of treatment reinitiation at the start of the 
NTRI phase.  The duration will be calculated by (NTRI start date – TFR start date + 1)/30.5.  
S
ubjects who do not reinitiate nilotinib will be censored at their study completion date. 
2.5.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the molecular relapse free rate (RFR) at 6 months after 
discontinuation from nilotinib therapy in patients with MR4.5.   
2.5.2.1 Data Handling 
Patients with confirmed MR4.5 and without confirmed loss of MR4.5 prior to the start of the 
TFR phase will be included in this analysis.  Patients without consecutive confirmed BCR-
ABL >0.1%IS measurements within 6 months after entering the TFR phase will be considered 
responders.   
Novartis Confidential  Page 22  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
Unscheduled visits falling between the start of the TFR phase and the scheduled 6 month TFR 
visit will be considered when determining if a subject is not a responder.  If a subject is 
missing the 6 month TFR visit, any unscheduled visit during the TFR phase occurring ≤ 185 
days after the TFR start date will be considered when determining of a subject is not a 
responder. 
2.5.2.2 Statistical Hypothesis, Model, and Method of Analysis 
The proportion of patients without molecular relapse within 6 months of starting the TFR 
phase will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  The demoninator for this 
proportion will be the number of patients who enter the TFR phase with confirmed MR4.5 
and without confirmed loss of MR4.5 prior to the start of the TFR phase.  A 95% confidence 
interval calculated using the exact Clopper-Pearson method will be provided.  
No statistical hypothesis will be tested on the primary efficacy variable. 
The analysis will be performed on the FAS. 
2.5.2.3 Supportive Analyses 
An exploratory analysis of the relapse free rate after starting the TFR phase will be performed 
using a logistic regression model to evaluate the dependence of relapse (Yes or No) on 
important prognostic variables.  The following parameters will be included in the model as 
covariates: 
 Age  
 Ge nder 
 S okal risk score classification (high/medium/low) 
 Duration of nilotinib in months defined as (date of last dose of study drug prior to start 
of consolidation phase – date of first dose of study drug + 1)/30.5. 
 Ma intenance of MR4.5 in the TFR phase defined as (date of confirmed loss of MR4.5 
– start date of MR4.5 + 1)/30.5. If a subject loses MR4.5 after the start of the TFR 
pha
se and regains it, only the longest interval of sustained MR4.5 will be considered.  
The start date of sustained MR4.5 is the date of confirmed MR4.5 at the beginning of a 
sustained MR4.5 interval.  If confirmed MR4.5 for an interval occurs prior to the start 
of 
the TFR phase, the start of the TFR phase will be considered the start of the 
interval.  Only patients who achieved MR4.5 when entering the TFR phase will be 
included in this anlaysis. 
o I f the subject does not have confirmed MR4.5 loss throughout the duration of 
the study, the end date will be taken as the last BCR-ABL assessment 
collected.  This includes patients that early terminate from the study. 
o If the patient has a confirmed loss of MR4.5 after the start of the TFR phase 
the first of the consecutive BCR-ABL > 0.0032%IS measurements will be 
considered the end date of MR4.5 maintenance. 
Novartis Confidential  Page 23  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
Stepwise selection of the covariates will be used.  Signficance level is 0.05 for a covariate to 
remain in the model.  Parameter estimates of the covariates as well as odds ratio estimates and 
95% confidence intervals will be provided. 
This analysis will be performed on the FAS. 
2.5.3 Secondary Endpoints 
The key secondary objective of the study is to evaluate relapse-free survival. 
The other secondary objectives of the study are: 
 To evaluate molecular relapse free rates at 12 and 24 months after nilotinib treatment 
discontinuation 
 To evaluate the proportion of patients who regain MR4.5 after restarting nilotinib 
following molecular relapse 
 To describe the impact of nilotinib treatment discontinuation on progression to AP/BC 
and CML-related deaths 
 Ove rall survival 
2.5.3.1 Statistical Analysis Methods for the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
 Relapse-free survival (as described in Section 2.5.1.2) after the start of the TFR phase 
will be summarized and graphed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimates of 
the 25th, median, 75th percentiles for the relapse-free survival and its 95% confidence 
intervals will be provided, if applicable.  This analysis will be performed on the FAS. 
 Ove rall survival (as described in Section 2.5.1.3) after the start of the TFR phase will 
be summarized and graphed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method as 
described above.  Patients who are alive at the date of last contact will be treated as 
censored observations.  This analysis will be performed on the FAS. 
 P rogression free survival (as described in section 2.5.1.4) after the start of the TFR 
phase will be summarized and graphed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method 
as described above.  Progression is defined as the first reported progression to 
accelerated phase (AP) or blast crisis (BC) as reported on the disease response eCRF 
after the start of the TFR phase.  This analysis will be performed on the FAS. 
 Treatment free survival (as described in section 2.5.1.5) after the start of the TFR 
phase will be summarized and graphed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method 
as described above.  This analysis will be performed on the FAS. 
 The  molecular relapse free rates at 12 and 24 months after the start of the TFR phase  
will be summarized and analyzed using the same multivariate logistic regression 
model as the primary efficacy endpoint. 
 The rate of patients who confirm MR4.5 after restarting nilotinib treatment following a 
mol
ecular relapse will be presented with an exact 95% Clopper-Pearson method.  The 
time to regain MR4.5 (months) will be summarized and graphed using the product-
Novartis Confidential  Page 24  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
limit (Kaplan -Meier) method as described above.  The time to regain MR4.5 is defined 
as (date of confirmed MR4.5 – start date of NTRI phase + 1)/30.5.  If a patient does 
not 
regain MR4.5 prior to the end of the NTRI phase, the patient will be censored at 
the last BCR-ABL ratio assessment prior to treatment discontinuation.  The time to 
regain MR4.5 will also be graphed with cumulative curves to depict current MR4.5 
rates over time in the NTRI phase by considering censored patients as non-responders.  
I
n addition, the time by which 50% of retreated patients have regained MR4.5 will be 
calculated. 
 The  rate of patients who confirm MR4.0 and MMR after restarting nilotinib will be 
summarized using the same method as described above for the rate of patients who 
confirm MR4.5. 
 The  number of patients with stable molecular response (MR4.5, MR4.0, or MMR) 
during the NTRI phase will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  Each 
response will be summarized separately.  Stable molecular response is defined as 
achievement of confirmed molecular response in the NTRI phase if again the same 
response is confirmed after 6 months of the original confirmation irrespective of 
whether there is loss of response in between achievement and 6 months.   This analysis 
will be performed on the FAS only for subjects who have entered the NTRI phase. 
 The  number of CML related deaths will be summarized using frequencies and 
percentages. 
The FAS for the primary analysis as described above will be used for these analyses.  
2.5.3.2 BCR-ABL Ratio (%)

SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term using 
the latest MedDRA version available. Grading will be based on CTCAE Version 4.03. 
Adverse events will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage of patients 
having any adverse event, having an adverse event in each primary system organ class, and 
having an adverse event with a particular preferred term within a system organ class. 
The following selection of AEs will be listed and summarized separately. All summaries will 
be by system organ class (SOC), preferred term (PT), and severity grade unless otherwise 
specified.  Summaries will include a total column. 
 AE s by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) 
 AE s by PT 
 AE s by relationship to study drug 
 AE s occurring in >= %5 of all patients 
 AEs by severity grade group (Grade 1 or 2 and Grade 3 or 4)

suspected to be related to study drug. 
Summaries will be repeated for the safety set, safety set by phase, full analysis set, and full 
a
nalysis set by phase.  Full anlaysis set by phase tables will only include the TFR and NTRI 
pha
ses. 
Figures for incidences of AEs occurring in the consolidation and TFR phases and for 
incidences of AEs occurring in the TFR and NTRI phases will be provided for both the SS 
and FAS. The incidence rate will be calculated by dividing the number of patients with any 
AE at a particular time by the number of patients in the safety set who are continuing in the 
study at that time.

For laboratory tests where grades are not defined by CTCAE, results will be graded by the 
low/normal/high classifications based on laboratory normal ranges . 
The following by-safety subset summaries will be generated separately for hematology, and 
biochemistry laboratory tests: 
 S hift tables using CTCAE grades to compare baseline to the worst on-phase value.  Four 
different baseline definitions for the different study phases, as defined in section 2.1.3.8, 
will
 be used. 
 F or laboratory tests where CTCAE grades are not defined, shift tables using the 
low/normal/high/(low and high). Four different baseline definitions for the different study 
pha
ses, as defined in section 2.1.3.8, will be used. 
 S ummary statistics of raw values and change from baseline by time point and by study 
pha
se 
 L isting of all laboratory data with values flagged to show the corresponding CTCAE 
grades and the classifications relative to the laboratory normal ranges. 
2.6.3 Serum and urine pregnancy test results will be listed.ECG Analysis 
A standard 12 lead ECG will be performed at screening, Day 1, and Day 8.  After a dose 
interruption or after any dose changes, additional (unscheduled) ECGs are required. 
Summary statistics for raw values and change from baseline of heart rate, PR interval, QRS 
dura
tion, QT interval, QTcF, QTcB, and frequencies and percentages of investigator 
interpretation will be presented by phase and visit within phase. 
A 
shift table for QTinterval and QTc values by phase will be provided using the following 
categories: 
 < = 450 ms 
 > 450 to 480 
 > 480 to 500 
 > 500  
The largest post-baseline result in each phase will be included in the shift table. 
F
our different baseline definitions for the different study phases, as defined in section 2.1.3.8, 
will
 be used. 
2.6.4 Vital Signs 
Vital signs raw values and change from baseline (weight, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure) will be summarized by phase and visit within phase   
Vital si
gns data will be summarized by shift table based on notable values by phase. 
The criteria for clinically notable abnormalities are defined as follows: 
Clinically notable values above normal 
 S ystolic BP: ≥ 140 mmHg 
Novartis Confidential  Page 32  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
 Diastolic BP: ≥ 90 mmHg 
 B ody Temperature (C): ≥ 37.5◦C 
 W eight: Baseline ≥ 110kg; Post-baseline: increase from baseline of ≥ 10% 
 He art rate: Baseline: ≥ 120 beats per minute (bpm); Post-baseline: ≥ 120 beats per 
minute (bpm) with increase from baseline of ≥ 15 bpm 
Clinically notable values below normal 
 S ystolic BP: ≤ 90 mmHg 
 Dia stolic BP: ≤ 40 mmHg 
 B ody Temperature (C): ≤ 35◦C 
 W eight: Baseline ≤ 60kg; Post-baseline: decrease from baseline of ≥ 10% 
 He art rate: Baseline: ≤ 50 bpm; Post-baseline: ≤ 50 bpm with decrease from baseline 
of ≥ 15 bpm 
F
our different baseline definitions for different study phases, as defined in section 2.1.3.8, will 
be used. 
Vital signs data will be listed. 
2.6.5 Physical Examination 
Significant physical examination findings that are present prior to the start of study drug must 
be summarized with the medical history data.  Significant findings made after the start of 
study drug, which meets the definition of an adverse event, will be summarized with the 
adverse event data. 
2.6.6 Extramedullary Involvement 
Extramedullary involvement data such as presence and location will be listed. 
2.6.7 ECOG Performance Status 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages by phase and visit within phase.

.6.8 Patient-reported outcomes 
2.6.8.1 MDASI-CML 
The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory for CML patients (MDASI-CML) will be used to 
assess the nature and impact of symptom burden on life.  The MDASI-CML consists of 20 
validated symptom items and 6 validated core interference items.  Each item is assessed on an 
11 point scale with responses from 0-10, = being “not present” and 10 being “as bad as you 
c
an imagine”. 
Novartis Confidential  Page 33  
SAP V1.0 21-Jun-2018 (1:53) CAMN107AUS37 
 
The interference score will be calculated when a patient scores at least 4 items out of the 6 
interference items using the formula: (sum of scores for the items answered) / number of 
items answered.   If a subject responds to less than 4 interference items, the interference score 
will be considered missing. 
The symptom score will be calculated when a patient scores at least 8 items out of the 14 
symptom items using the formula: (sum of scores for the items answered) / number of items 
answered.   If a subject responds to less than 8 symptom items, the symptom score will be 
considered missing (Ceeland, 2009). 
The symptom and interference subscale total scores with their change from baseline will be 
summ
arized descriptively at all post-baseline time points by phase and visit within phase. 
This analysis will be performed on the SS. 
2.6.8.2 EQ-5D-3L 
The EQ-5D-3L will be used to assess the impact of nilotinib treatment discontinuation in 
patient utility.  The questionnaire comprises 5 items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and the EQ visual analog scale.  Each item has 3 
levels (no problems, some problems, and extreme problems) and visual analog has a scale of 0 
to 100 (0=works imaginable health state, 100=best imaginable health state). 
The percentages of patients at each level of the five items of the EQ-5D-3L will be 
summarized overall as appropriate at baseline and all post-baseline time points by phase and 
visit within phase. 
The visual analog scale raw values and change from baseline will be summarized using 
numeric summary statistics by visit and phase. 
This analysis will be performed on the SS. 
2.6.8.3 SF-8 Questionnaire 
The SF-8 Questionnaire consists of 8 items (general health, physical functioning, role-
physical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) will be 
used to assess the impact of nilotinib treatment discontinuation on the quality of life.  Each 
item has a 5 or 6 point response range.  Physical and mental component summary measures 
(calculated using Optum’s norm-based scoring method) will be summarized at baseline and 
all post-baseline time points using numeric summary statistics.  I ndividual item scores will be 
listed. 
This analysis will be performed on the SS.

Research Aims:   
 
1. Research Questions(s):   Does the administration of intrathecal morphine after delivery reduce the 
risk of post -dural puncture headache (PDPH)  following unintentional dural puncture  (UDP)  with a 
17-g Tuohy needle in obstetric patients?   
 
2. Hypotheses:   Intrathecal morphine  decreases the incidence of PDPH  as compared to placebo  after 
UDP  with a Tuohy needle in obstetric patients.  
 
Background:   Unintentional dural puncture is a known risk of neuraxial techniques, occurring in roughly 
1% of all epidural catheter placements.1-3  The incidence of PDPH after unintentional dural puncture is 50 -
80%.3-5  The International Headache Society has defined PDPH as a headache that occurs following a dural 
puncture , worsens within 15 minutes after sitting or sta nding and improves within 15 minutes after lying, 
with at least one of the following: neck stiffness, tinnitus, hypacusia, photophobia, or nausea.  The headache 
develops within 5 days after dural puncture and resolves either spontaneously within 1 week or within 48 
hours after effective treatment of the spinal fluid leak (usually by epidural blood patch).6  PDPH can be a 
significant cause of maternal morbidity in the obstetric patient.  In addition to interfering with the mother’s 
ability to care for  her newborn, treatment of PDPH can increase health care costs by prolonging the length 
of hospitalization and  number of emergency room visits.7   
Several strategies exist to t reat PDPH, but currently there are no proven interventions for preventing or 
reducing the likelihood of PDPH following unintentional dural puncture.8,9 Previously investigated 
strategies include prophylactic epidural blood patch, the use of intrathecal (IT) catheter with delayed 
removal,  intrathecal saline injection and infusion,  and cosyntropin administration.10-15  Retrospective  and 
observational  studies have demonstrated a decrease in PDPH rates following unintentional dural puncture 
when intrathecal catheters are p laced instead of subsequent placement of an epidural catheter.1,12  Other 
observational studies have examined the use of intrathecal opioids t o reduce the incidence of PDPH.14,16  
Recently, one randomized controlled trial  explored the use of epidural morphine for the prevention and 
treatment of PDPH with positive results. Al -metwalli showed a decrease in the PDPH rate from 48% to 
12% after administration of epidural morphine 3 mg at the time of delivery and again at 24 hours 
postpartum .17  Administration of epidural morphine following UDP may produce unpredictable central 
nervous system side effects , however , as a large  dural hole may facilitate intrathecal translocation of 
epidural morphine , increasing the risk of respirat ory depression.   At our institution, it is common practice 
for an intrathecal catheter to be placed after UDP instead of an epidural catheter at another spinal level. 
Given that the administration of epidural morphine  after known UDP may have  unpredictable effects and 
that the use of intrathecal catheters following UDP is a common practice , we feel i t is necessary to study 
the use of intrathecal morphine administration following UDP to decrease the incidence of PDPH .  In our 
randomized prospec tive study, the rates of PDPH following unintentional dural puncture with placement 
of an intrathecal catheter will be compared in two groups:  intrathecal morphine versus intrathecal saline

administer intrathecal morphine 150 μg as this is the current dose given to parturients receiving morphine 
via spinal administration for Cesarean delivery  and has a predictable side effect profile and history of safety 
in this population .  The dose roughly corresponds to the epidural morphine dose administered by Al -
metwalli in his randomized controlled trial.17

Significance:   PDPH can lead to significant morbidity.  Alon g with headache, patients may develop cranial 
nerve palsy during the postpartum period leading to permanent disability.  In addition, new mothers are 
unable to bond with their babies due to headache and assoc iated symptoms including nausea, vomiting  and 
limited mobility secondary to pain .  PDPH can negatively impact patient satisfaction with postpartum 
recovery.   Therefore, an effective intervention to decrease the risk of PDPH after UDP would be useful.

IRB# STU00043549  Investigational Plan:  
 
Study design:  prospective, randomized -control led, blinded  study  
 
Methods:  
1. Size of study groups(s):    
The incidence of PDPH has been estimated to  approximately  50% after unintentional dural puncture .18 
Assuming that a decrease of at least 50% would be necessary to suggest a clinical utility of this treatment, 
we determined that a sample size of 6 4 patients in each group would be required to achieve an 80% power 
to detect this difference between epidural and intrathecal catheter.  Group sample sizes of 64 achieve 80% 
power to detect a  difference between the group proportions of 0.25. The proportion in group one (the 
treatment  group) is assumed to be 0.5 under the null hypothesis and 0. 25 under the alternative  hypothesis. 
The proportion in group two (the control group) is 0.5. The test statistic used  is the two -sided Fisher's exact 
test. The significa nce level of the test was targeted at  0.05. The significance level actually achieved by this 
design is 0.03.   Sample size was calculated using PASS 11, version 11.0.01, release date 11/3/2010 (NCSS 
Inc. Kaysville , UT). To account for protocol exclusions an d patients lost to follow -up, 170 patients will be 
randomized .  Recruitment for this project will take roughly 1 -2yrs.  
 
2. Patient entry, exclusion and dropout criteria:  
Inclusion :  Postpartum patients  following vaginal delivery  with an unintentional dural puncture and 
functioning intrathecal catheter .  Patients must be 18 years of age or older and English speaking.  
Exclusion:   Previous PDPH , body mass index BMI>40  kg/m2, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) , morphine 
allergy  and patient s who receive Cesarean delivery (as these patients would all receive intrathecal morphine 
and could therefore not be randomized ).   
 
3. Protocol specific methods:   Eligible patients  will be asked by anesthesia personnel to participate in this 
study shortly following delivery  when the nurse taking care of the patient deems the patient appropriate for 
discharge .  Informed, written consent will be obtained  and the pharmacy on the 10th floor Prentice Women’s 
Hospital  will determine group allocation  by randomization table .  The patient will be randomized to one 
of two groups:  intrathecal morphine  (treatment)  vs. saline (control)  which will be administered  through the 
existing intrathecal catheter .  Patients randomized to the treatment group  (morphine)  will receive 
preservative -free morphine 0.3 mL (150 mcg) intrathecally .  Those randomized to the control group will 
receive  normal saline 0.3 mL intrathecally .   The drugs will be prepared in  syringes by a pharmacist on the 
10th floor Prentice Women’s Hosptial  and labeled as “IT morphine study drug. ”  The anesthesiologist 
injecting the study drug, the study nurse collecting follow -up data, and the patient will be blinded to group 
assignment. After thoroughly  sanitizing the catheter port with a Chloroprep wipe and allowing adequate 
time for drying of the  Chloroprep, t he anesthesiologist will first attach a 3 -mL syringe to the catheter port 
and aspirate to a volume of 1  mL. This syringe will then be removed from the port.   The study drug will 
then be administered through the intrathecal catheter via the t uberculin syringe.  The 3-mL syringe 
containing the aspirate will then be injected via the catheter , effectively flushing the study drug through the 
catheter.  The intrathecal catheter will be removed  immediately following the injection .  If the 
anesthesiol ogist is unable to aspirate from the catheter, the intrathecal drug will be  administered and flushed 
with 1.0 mL of preservative free saline to ensure drug delivery.  The inability to aspirate will be noted on 
the data sheet at the time of administration.  Sterile gloves will be used for all morphine or saline 
administration.   
 
After administration of intrathecal morphine, all patients will  have their respirations monitored every hour 
for a period of 12 hours and then every two hours for a period of 12  hours.  This is standard protocol after 
the administration of neuraxial morphine at NMH.  If the patient develops symptoms of nausea, vomiting, 
urinary retention or pruritus, she will receive standard interventions per the NMH order -set for neuraxial 
opioi ds.

On postpartum days 1 -5, all patients will be visited daily while inpatient and called by phone after discharge 
from the hospital.  The following  information will be also recorded  in this study : presence or absence of 
PDPH  (as defined by the Internat ional Headache Society) , signs and symptoms of cranial nerve injury, the 
patient’s verbal rating score for pain  (VRSP, 0 -10 scale) , current headache treatments including oral 
analgesics, intravenous caffeine, or epidural blood patch , side effects of intrat hecal morphine (respiratory 
depression, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention .  Patients who develop a headache will be followed 
for 3 days after the resolution of their headache.  Physician observers will make treatment recommendations 
accordin g to the following protocol ( previously described by Scavone et al, 200415):  Mild postural 
head aches (defined as VRSP <4) will be treated with conservative therapy including oral hydration, 
increased oral caffeine intake, and oral analgesics as needed.  Moderate postural headaches (defined as 
VRSP 4 -6 without limitation of childcare ability) will al so receive conservative therapy.  Patients with 
moderate postural headaches limiting childcare abilities, and patients complaining of severe postural 
headaches (defined as VRSP >6) will be advised to undergo a therapeutic epidural blood patch  (EBP) .  This 
treatment will consist of the epidural injection  of 20 mL of autologous blood  over 2 to 3 min through the 
epidural needle, injected at the level of the presumed UDP or one level below.  The patient will be 
positioned  in the sitting position for the procedure and then repositioned supine for a period of 1 hour after 
the epidural blood injection.   The EBP will not be performed for at least 24 h ours after dural puncture.  If 
the EBP fails to relieve the headache after 24 hours, or if the headache recurs after successful treatment, the 
EBP may be repeated.   The protocol outlined above follows standard procedure at NMH.  
 
4. Risks/Benefits:    
Risks to study patients include:  itching, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, cons tipation, dizziness, 
hypotension, depression of cough reflex and slowing of respirations . The rare risk is respiratory depression 
leading to respiratory arrest.   
 
The presumed risks are similar to that assumed by  any parturient who receiv es spinal morphine for Cesarean 
delivery, which is common practice.  To minimize the  risk of apnea, patient will be monitored postpartum 
in the same manner that patients receiving neuraxial morphine for Cesarean delivery are routinely 
monitored  as described above .   
 
 If any patient experiences nausea, vomiting or pruritus, she will be treated with medications based on the 
clinical scenario as evaluated by the attending anesthesiologist on duty who will not be blinded to treatment 
group.  There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality.    
 
Confidentiality:  Access to electronic data is computer password protected.  All data will be deleted from 
the password protected computer 5 years after manuscript preparation. Electronic and paper documents will 
be destroyed u sing current technology. The paper documents will be shredded using the current vendor for 
HIPAA sensitive documents using the current technique.  
 
 
Data Analysis:  
1. Data collection form:   Data collection form attached.  
 
2. Data evaluation:   The primary outcome is the incidence of PDPH.  The intrathecal morphine and 
saline groups will be compared using the Fisher ’s exact test.  The clinical characteristics of the study groups 
will be compared between groups using the Mann Whitney test for interval and continuous data and a χ2 
statistic for nominal data. Secondary outcomes include severity of headache, need for epidural blood patch, 
rate of neuraxial infection, neuraxial complications.  P < 0.05 will be required to reject the null hypothesis.

84.1 Cancer Immunotherapy and Immune System
The primary modalities of cancer treatment are Surgery, Chemotherapy, and 
Radiation therapy. Unfortunately, cancer conti nues to rise as a primary cause of death 
in the United States because these current mo dalities are unable to cure most patients 
once cancer has metastasized[1]. Recently t he field of immunotherapy has gained 
significant interest as basic science discoveries have been translated to FDA 
approved clinical therapies, including checkpoint blockade immunotherapy[2, 3].
Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy (CBI), including anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, has received mainstream attention due to the potential for dramatic and durable clinical  responses in certain patient s with metastatic disease[4-
6]. CBI is now FDA approved for melanoma and lung cancers and is helping to establish immunotherapy as a new fourth moda lity of cancer care. Unfortunately, not 
all patients respond to single  agent or dual agent CBI and the activity of current 
agents appears to be limited to certain disease types. Thus the next logical step is 
combining CBI with surgery, chemotherapy  or radiation therapy and understanding 
how to best incorporate immunotherapy in to palliative and defi nitive treatment 
regimens[7, 8].
It is now widely accepted that the immune system plays a critical role in tumor 
biology, as described by the three E's of cancer immunoediting, elimination, equilibrium, and escape[9]. The term elimination represents the classical paradigm 
of immuno-surveillance, where the immune sy stem is seeking and eradicating cells 
which have undergone maligna nt transformation. Equilibrium represents a dynamic 
state potentially lasting years where malignant cells under internal and external stress 
adapt and respond to survive while interacting and modulating the immune system. 
Tumor escape denotes a phase where select cancer cells have overcome barriers to 
continued growth and can proliferate and spread in an immunocompetent host. As 
these interactions between the immune system and cancer cells becomes better 
understood additional targets and strate gies for immuno-modulation have been 
discovered and translated for clinical bene fit. Immunotherapy aims to provide a 
highly specific, efficacious, and well tolerated anti-cancer therapy. However, until 
very recently most immunotherapy approaches have not proven to be very potent. 
Methods which enhance the induction and potency of the immune response are 
needed in order to continue the progress of immunotherapy in the clinic.
Development of an immune response is a complex and highly regulated process 
which involves interaction of multiple different cell types. In a simplified example, an antigen presenting cell (APC) such as a macrophage or dendritic cell (DC) captures 
an antigen which it then presents via MHC on the cell surface[10]. The APC then 
migrates back to a lymph node where it interacts with CD4 T-helper cells. The T-cell 
receptor binds to the antigen presented on  MHC and in the presence of proper co-
stimulation, a T- or B-cell is then signaled to propagate an immune response resulting in development of cytotoxic effector T-cells or tumor specific antibodies, 
respectively. There are classically two sign als which are needed in order to induce a 
specific immune response: Signal 1 is the antigen; Signal 2 is the co-stimulatory

9surface molecule. Professional APCs including DCs are the most potent antigen 
presenting cells capable of inducing immune responses due to their high antigen 
presentation capacity, high expression of co-stimulatory molecules and ability to 
secrete significant levels of co-stimulatory cytokines. The presence of these co-
stimulatory molecules cannot be understated as DCs, which do not express co-
stimulatory molecules, can cause T-cell an ergy and actively suppress development of 
a specific immune response[10]. Unfortunately the tumor microenvironment is highly immunosuppressive and tumor cells use sophisticated mechanisms to inhibit immune responses. Indeed, there are a variety of different mechanisms used by tumors to 
suppress the immune response including ph ysical barriers, loss of antigen or MHC, 
increasing expression of inhibitory cell surface molecules, secretion of inhibitory cytokines, and recruitment of suppressor ce ll populations such as T-regulatory cells 
(Tregs) or Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)[11-13]. The presence of these powerful inhibitory mechanisms highlights the need for combinatorial 
immunotherapy strategies to unlock the full potential of the immune system to fight 
cancer. 
While immunotherapy is establishing its elf as a novel and effective modality of 
cancer treatment, the current use FDA appr oved indication for CBI is in patients 
with metastatic disease. The ability for cancers to metastasize depends on a number 
of factors including histology, location, time, as well as the genetics or biology of the 
cancer. Interestingly, some aggressive tumors metastasize early in the course of disease while other cancers behave more indolently and may never metastasize. 
Along these lines there is a term called oligometastatic disease in which metastases 
are limited in number and location (for example only 3 lung metastasis, or only 2 
liver metastasis). Although there is no strict definition of oligometastases, it is
commonly interpreted to be no more than 5 or 6 metastatic sites. The presence of 
an oligometastatic state was originally coined by Hellman et al., who hypothesized 
that patients with olgiometastatic disease might derive benefit from effective local 
therapy applied to all sites of disease[14]. Clinical data has supported this hypothesis 
and the aggressive treatment of metastatic disease with surgery and chemotherapy in patients with isolated pulmonary metastases or liver metastases has resulted in long 
term survival[15-17]. The optimal type of  treatment for metastases depends on a 
number of factors including histology, loca tion, size, and number of sites. However, 
options for definitive local therapy include surgery (metastectomy), other ablative 
therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryotherapy, specific targeted 
systemic therapies including hormonal therapy, or ablative radiation therapy 
(Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). In this trial we are investigating 
combining checkpoint blockade immunothera py with focused radiation therapy 
(SBRT) in attempt to enhance response rates and improve clinical outcomes for 
these patients.
4.2 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)

10Radiation therapy has a long and established history in the field of oncology[18].
Recently, technological advances have allowed radiation oncologists to effectively treattumors anywhere in the body using SBRT[19]. This ability to deliver high tumoricidal doses while limiting dose to surrounding normal structures has been a major advance and fundamental shift in the field of radiation oncology. The term stereotactic radiation or stereotaxy refers to the use of a referenced three-dimensional coordinate system to locate targets inside the body and deliver highly focused beams of radiation to that site with millimeter accuracy. Stereotactic delivery of radiation is usually termed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for extracranial tumors, and referred to as Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for intracranial tumors. Because of the accuracy and ability to precisely modify the radiation dose distribution to minimize radiation to normal tissue, stereotactic radiation allows for "hypofractionation" or delivery of very 
high doses of radiation during each fraction of treatment. In the United States, clinical stereotactic radiation courses are currently completed in 1 to 5 fractions total. This is a dramatic shortening of total treatment time compared to conventionally fractionated radiation which can range from between 2-8 weeks or 10-40 fractions to complete. Clinically, stereotactic radiation achieves excellent local control rates, for example SRS for AVMs[20], trigeminal neuralgia[21], pituitary adenoma[22], brain metastases[23].SBRT for early stage lung cancer has local control rates rivaling those of surgery[24].
SBRT is also being increasingly used as an effective local therapy for metastatic lesions or in patients with oligometastatic disease. Local control rates greater than 75% have 
been reported for metastatic tumors of the lung, liver, and spine, which is significantly higher than standard conventional moderate dose radiation[25-27]. Given these response rates, SBRT is being used in place of surgery for oligometastatic disease to target pulmonary metastasis, especially in patients who are not optimal surgical candidates. A number of institutions have reported favorable outcomes using either single or multi-fraction SBRT for oligometasta tic sites within the lung. For example, a 
90% control rate at 9 months was reported with SBRT was prescribed to 26 Gy in a single fraction[28].  Hof et al, reported a 63% progression free survival at 3 years when SBRT was prescribed to 12-30Gy[29]. Le et al, treated early stage and metastatic lung tumors with SBRT using doses of 15-30 Gy and report a local control of 91% for doses greater than 20 Gy and 54% for doses less than  20 Gy[26].  However, toxicity was rare 
when doses of less than 25 Gy were given[26]. Thus a dose of 9.5 Gy x 3 will allow for safe targeting of pulmonary metastases. Radi osensitizing effects of checkpoint blockade 
may result in synergistic effects and may improve the local control rates radiation while providing acceptable toxicity. There have been reports of high grade pneumonitis in patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, although there has been no definitive evidence of supra-additive toxicity when radiation is combined with CBI[30, 31].
Regarding liver metastases, systemic chemotherapy or molecular-targeted agents rarely achieve long term control. On the other hand, surgical removal of colorectal liver metastases has resulted in reported 5-year survival rates approaching 50%, demonstrating that local therapy has a potential curative role in patients with oligometastatic disease[17, 25, 32]. In inoperable patients, the benefit of local therapy is

11less clear, however long-term survival has been reported after the resection of liver 
metastases from sarcoma, breast cancer, and other histologies [33]. Classically the dose limiting toxicity with radiation therapy to the liver has been radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). However, with the technological advances in radiation therapy and image guidance SBRT can now be delivered sa fely resulting in high tumor doses to 
portions of the liver while sparing other portions of the liver. For example, no cases of RILD after radiation for colorectal liver metastases were seen when the mean liver dose was <31 Gy at the University of Michigan[34]. A phase I dose-escalation trial of single fraction treatment for liver metastases reported even high doses up to 30Gy in 1 fraction with no dose-limiting toxicity and a 2 year actuarial survival rate of 50% at a medial followup of 17 months[35].
In summary, SBRT has been well tolerated and efficacious with minimal toxicity in 
national and international trials. This sign ificant advancement in radiation technology 
and capability calls for a re-evaluation of th e effects of focused radiation on the immune 
system and in combination with immunotherapy.  Based on data above, in this study we will evaluate whether CBI plus 28.5Gy of SBRT (9.5Gy x 3 fractions) improves objective response rates and local as well as distant control.

124.3 Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy
Recently, there have been several signif icant and critical advancements in the 
immunotherapy field[37, 38] including a doptive T-cell transfer, dendritic cell 
vaccines, peptide vaccines, oncolytic viruse s, cytokine therapy, agonist monoclonal 
antibodies, and small molecules. Of thes e new advancements, checkpoint blockade 
Immunotherapy (CBI) is perhaps one of the most exciting in recent years. The 
significant interest in checkpoint bloc kade immunotherapy (CBI) stems from the 
dramatic and durable responses observed in a subset of patients  with metastatic 
disease who have been heavily pre-treated.  At its core, CBI functions to inhibit 
negative regulators of immune responses, or  in other words removing the brakes on 
the immune system. For decades immunothe rapy approaches have focused on 
attempting to positively stimulate the immune responses without necessarily addressing the powerful negative regulatory systems that are in place which dampen 
or prevent excessive immune responses. It  is now understood that disabling these 
negative regulators or checkpoints can resu lt in robust and clinically efficacious 
immune responses which in some cases can c ontrol widely metastatic disease. CTLA-
4 (Cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen 4) is a receptor present on the surface of T-cells which binds the co-stimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 on APCs with a much higher affinity than CD28. Instead of transmitting a positive co-stimulatory signal to the T-cell, ligation of CTLA-4 transmits a powerful inhibitory signal to T cells which can block T-cell activation. Indeed, CTLA-4  is one of the most powerful negative 
regulatory molecules on the cell surface of  T-cells[36]. Similarly, Programmed death 
receptor 1 (PD-1) is a receptor on T-cells which binds PD-L1 or PD-L2 and recruits SHP phosphatases to impose a powerful inhibitory signal on T-cell activation and proliferation. Inhibiting the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways is now FDA approved for 
metastatic melanoma, NSCLC cell lung cancer and Kidney Cancer. 
In 2011 the FDA granted approval to the anti-CTLA-4 drug ipilimumab (Yervoy, 
Bristol-Myers Squibb) for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In 
Sept 2014 the FDA granted approval to  the anti-PD-1 drug pembrolizumab
(Keytruda, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.) for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma. 
In Dec 2014 the FDA granted accelerated ap proval for the anti-PD-1 drug nivolumab 
(Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for patient s with progressive unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma after treatment with ipilimumab or BRAF inhibitor. Nivolumab received FDA approval on March 4
th2015 for treatment of advanced squamous 
NSCLC that has progressed after treatment  with platinum-based chemotherapy. In 
the phase II clinical trial CheckMate- 063, tumors shrank in 15% of patients who 
took Opdivo, and 26% had stable disease. Additionally the phase III CheckMate-017 
trial in which NSCLC patients received either docetaxel chemotherapy or Opdivo 
was stopped early after it became evident th at nivolumab outperfo rmed docetaxel. In 
Sept 2015 the FDA granted accelerated appr oval to nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 wild-type, unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma. Along the same lines, the anti-PD-1 drug Keytruda

non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whos e disease has progressed after other 
treatments and with tumors that express a protein called PD-L1. In the KEYNOTE-
001 trial Keytruda resulted in  an overall response rate of  41% (n=25/61) in patients

FDA approved Nivolumab to treat patients with advanced (metastatic) renal cell 
carcinoma. Additionally CBI has demonstrated clinical activity in a variety of tumor types including bladder cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and prostate cancer among many others [4-6, 30, 37-42]. The body of clin ical data evaluating the activity of CBI 
is established and remarkable[39-46] w ith additional FDA approved indications for 
different disease sites anticipated.
Immunotherapies and CBI can have unique pr ofile of side effect termed termed 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Examples of irAE include dermatologic (rash), gastrointestinal (colitis), hepatic (hepatitis), endocrine (hypophysitis), pulmonary (pneumonitis) and are thought to relate to  general increased activity of the immune 
system and inflammation. CBI has been studied in Phase III clinical trials with large numbers of patients evaluated and the general frequencies of irAE have been reported. 
These reported frequencies serve as refere nce values for estimating any increased 
toxicity with combinatorial therapies. 
4.4 Rationale for SBRT combined with CBI
There is now an established body of pre-clinical literature demonstrating that radiation can modify anti-tumor immune responses. Radiation has been demonstrated to cause upregulation of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and increase presentation of antigens on surface of tumor cells [43-48]. The DNA damage and reactive oxygen species induced by radiation have been shown to result in inflammatory tumor cell death and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1), which can activate antigen presenting cells[49-51]. Radiation induced activation of antigen presenting cells has also been demonstrated in animal models to enhance tumor antigen cross-presentation in the draining lymph node and result in ac tivation and proliferation of tumor specific 
cytotoxic T-cells[47, 52-57]. Radiation has also been shown to influence expression of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1, IL-2, L-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, CXCL-16, as 
well as Type I and Type II Interferons which may play a critical role in modulating immune responses[58-65]. Undoubtedly due to the culmination of these effects, multiple groups have demonstrated that radiation can cause tumor cells to become more susceptible to immune mediated attack[44, 45, 66]. Indeed some authors have suggested that the therapeutic effects of radiation alone may depend on the status of the host immune system and anti-tumor immune responses in the radiation field[54, 63, 67-69].Given these effects using radiation alone there has been a significant effort to combine radiation with various immunotherapies with sometimes striking results within the radiation field (radiosensitizing immunotherapy), as well as distantly outside the radiation field (abscopal responses)[44, 47, 53, 65, 66, 69-78]. A number of excellent 
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
14reviews have also highlighted the potential benefits and ongoing clinical trials of 
radiation combined with immunotherapy[61, 79-83].
Along these lines, recent evidence has demonstrated that focused radiation can in fact stimulate an anti-tumor immune response outsi de of the radiation field, termed the 
abscopal effect. This phenomenon was originally coined by Dr. R.H. Mole in 1953 as an effect of radiation away from the primary ta rget, or in other words, an action at a 
distance (49).  Work by Silvia Formenti and colleagues from New York University hasfurther characterized the abscopal effect (50) (51). Demaria et al. found that growth of a 
non-irradiated mammary carcinoma was impaired with the use of Flt3-ligand and radiation to a contralateral tumor (50). The authors also provided evidence that this
effect was T-cell dependent as it was not observed in T-cell deficient hosts. Given that radiation is capable of induci ng inflammation, apoptosis, cell death, and release of tumor 
antigens (53), this would create an ideal lo cal environment for induction of a potent 
immune response (50) (54) (55) (56). Thus th e preponderance of pre-clinical data would 
suggest that adding SBRT to CBI has the potential to enhance systemic anti-tumor 
immune responses which c ould help to control systemic metastatic disease and improve 
objective response rates. Indeed, a number of  ongoing clinical trials are evaluating 
radiation therapy combined with CBI. 
On the basis of this preclinical and clinical evidence, we propose a phase II studyof CBI combined with SBRT in patients with metastatic disease. With published dataestablishing the relative safety of multi-fraction SBRT to the brain, lungs, liver, prostate, and pancreas, we have decided to proceed with 28.5 Gy of SBRT (9.5Gy x3fractions) concurrently with CBI. However, the use of a three fractions concurrentwith CBI is not of proven benefit. This investigation aims to confirm the safety andefficacy for SBRT used concurrently with a CBI in the setting of metastaticdisease. The dose selected has been c a r e f u l l y  chosen with the belief that it issafe and effective based on prior experience with SBRT. All patients will betreated with three fractions, targeted to the lesion concurrently with CBI. 
Patient’s with metastatic disease have a poor prognosis. Current treatment modalities are 
generally palliative and patients are rarely cured, thus additional treatment modalities are 
certainly needed. This proposed study represents a logical extension of the current understanding of immunotherapy and radiation therapy and potential for synergy between these two modalities. This study will refine the current understanding of radiation tolerance for normal tissues in 3 fractions, thereby making it possible to treat future patients more safely and aggressively. Additionally, this study could identify a new indication for SBRT in specifically for enhancing the systemic effects of immunotherapy. Finally, this study has the potential to translate into improved local as well as distant control ultimately improved overall survival.

6.TREATMENT PLAN  
6.1 Diagnostic Procedures
A CT scan or MRI will be performed for tumor localization using rigid
immobilization appropriate for stereotactic treatment. A separate PET-CT may beperformed (optional) for diagnostic purposes and can be used for treatment planningwith fusion – the identical study would be performed if the patient were havingstandard conventional dose radiation.
6.2 Therapeutic Procedures
Patients will be pre-screened for eligibility and should be enrolled and randomized prior to starting immunotherapy. However, patient s who have started immunotherapy up to 5 
days prior to enrollment will be still be eligible for screening, randomization, and 
enrollment.
Upon confirmation of eligibility and enrollment in the study, the following will
be completed:
1) Demographics review, medical history and clinical exam
2) Review of concurrent medications3) Vital signs, height and weight4) Laboratory Bloodwork including: CBC, BMP, LFT.
5) Plasma and Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected and
subsequently frozen for immune monitoring assays. 
6) Tumor measurements (Recist 1.1) within 4 weeks prior to start of CBI
Upon randomization into the SBRT arm of th e protocol, patients will be seen by at 
least one of the Co-Investigator Radiation Oncologists. CT simulation will be
performed with fabrication of a radiation therapy immobilization device (such as a Vac-Lok) which will be custom made for each patient. The treating radiation 
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
17oncologist will identify the location of the tumor. Gross tumor volume (GTV) 
delineation will be performed on sequential axial computed tomography images. An SBRT treatment plan will be developed based on tumor size and location. The dose will be prescribed to the minimal isodose line that completely covers the GTV plus a 5 
mm margin. Adjacent normal structures including but not limited to the chest wall, spinal cord, heart, esophagus, aorta, kidne ys, rectum, bowel, liver, and stomach within 
5 cm of the GTV will be identified for the purpose of limiting incidental radiation to these structures.
In addition, prior to treatment delivery, a four-dimensional cone beam CT study willbe performed on individual patients to asse ss respiration in these patients and to
determine tumor targeting accuracy for those tumors that may be subject to respiratorymotion such as those in the lung, abdomen, or liver. If tumor motion is greater than
5 mm, the planning target volume (PTV) will be expanded to account for respiration.
Within three weeks of the 1
stcycle of checkpoint blockade, SBRT will be administered
using image-guidance. An Vac-Lok (or equi valent immob ilization device such as 
Alpha-Cradle) will be used to minimize movement of the chest, spine, and
abdomen during treatment. During trea tment, cone beam CT images of the patient’s
body site of interest will be obtained. Cone beam CT scan will be obtainedimmediately prior to treatment and will be repeated until the treatment shift, required
to align the CT planning scan and the cone beam CT scan performed on the day of
treatment cone beam CT, is within tolerance for the body site per standard clinical 
practice. 
The patient will receive SBRT within 1-21 days of the start of Cycle#1 of CBI.
Afterwards, the patient will continue to receive CBI as indicated and recommended by the treating medical oncologist. Patients will be evaluated for adverse
events/toxicities during their treatment.
6.2.1 The dose limits for surrounding cr itical structures are as follows [Base in part from 
Stereotactic body radiation therapy: The report of AAPM Task Group 101, Med. 
Phys. 37(8), August 2010]:

6.3 Follow-Up Procedures
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
18Subsequent to Cycle 1 Day 1, patients will be followed clinically, radiographically, and 
with bloodwork. A detailed medi cal and physical examination will be performed at 8 
weeks and 16 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months. A complete 
blood count (CBC) and comprehensive chemis try panel and CT scan including the 
treated site will be performed at the 8 week and 16 week follow-up and will continue at intervals of every 6 months until 2 years post SBRT treatment.
Tumor measurements (Recist 1.1) at 8 weeks (+/- 10 days) and 16 weeks (+/- 10
days) will be used to determine radiographic response.
6.4 Duration of Therapy
The patient will receive CBI as indicated and recommended by the treating medical 
oncologist. 
6.5 Duration of Follow-Up
It is anticipated that this study will last 5 years. Routine follow-up appointments as clinically indicated after 2 years will be used to capture and determine overall survival endpoints. 
6.6 Criteria for Patient Removal
Unacceptable adverse events grade IV or greater with an attribution of possibly
related to CBI Monotherapy, Combination CBI, or CBI combined with SBRT. 
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment.Extraordinary Medical Circumstance: If at any time the treating physician feels 
constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patients’s health the patient can be removed from protocol therapy. 
Patient can elect to discontinue treatment at any time.
6.7 Alternatives
The study has been designed to minimize potential risks to participants. This is
primarily through designation of a dose range shown to be safe in previous SBRTtrials and careful patient monitoring. The risks of CBI are detailed in section 7 as well as in the manufacturer treatment guidelines. Risks to confidentiality will beminimized by having access to study records available only to the investigators withthe exception of the standard clinical records (lab values, dictations, operative notes,etc) which are maintained through the UCSD Health System and Moores Cancer Center.
Standard therapies for metastatic disease include conventional radiotherapy,chemotherapy, or observation. Such treatment may or may not be applicable forpatients enrolled in this study. Regardless, patients will be expected to forgostandard chemotherapy or radiothera py until there is evidence of clinical or
radiographic disease progression. The amount of radiation administered viaprotocol therapy will be considered in de termining how much additional radiation
can be given using conventional external beam fractionation.

INFORMATION  
7.1 ANTI-CTLA-4 DRUG INFORM ATION AND ADMINISTRATION
7.1.1 Relevant Prior Clinical Information
The results of a randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial published in 2010 showed a 
first-ever overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with previously treated stage III/stage IV metastatic melanoma who received ipilimumab compared with the controls. The patients in that trial (N= 676) were randomized to receive either 
glycoprotein 100 (gp100) vaccine with Ipilimumab, gp100 alone, or Ipilimumab monotherapy in a 3:1:1 ratio. Patients receiving Ipilimumab monotherapy or with gp100 experienced a significantly longer median OS compared to those who received gp100 alone (approximately 10 vs . 6.4 months respectively). The risk of 
progression was reduced 19% with Ipilimumab plus gp100 and 36% with 
Ipilimumab alone compared to gp100 al one; subsequently, the FDA approved 
Ipilimumab alone in 2011. This OS advantage was observed while using a lower dose (3 mg/kg), than preceding studies (10 mg/kg) with a durable response demonstrated despite the lack of a maintenance phase.
In a Phase 1 trial testing ipilimumab in patients with stage III and IV melanoma, 
three doses were given: 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 3 mg/kg. A dose-response was VHHQZLWKRQO\WKHPJNJGRVHDFKLHYLQJWURXJKFRQFHQWUDWLRQV RIȝJP/

March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
20steady state with the 3-mg/kg regimen is 21.8
The effects of various covariates on Ipilimumab pharmacokinetics have been 
assessed in population pharmacokinetic analyses. Ipilimumab CL increases with increasing body weight; however, no dose ad justment of ipilimumab is required 
for body weight after administration on a milligram per kilogram basis. The following factors have no clinically meaningful effect on the CL of Ipilimumab: age (range 26 to 86 years), gender, performance status, renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment, prior use of systemic anticancer therapy, or baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. [84].
Renal Impairment: Creatinine clearance at baseline does not have a clinically 
important effect on Ipilimumab pharmacokinetics in patients with calculated creatinine clearance values of 29 mL/min or greater[84].
Hepatic Impairment: Baseline AST, total bilirubin, and ALT levels does not have 
a clinically important effect on Ipilimumab pharmacokinetics in patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment[84].
7.1.2 Safety Profile
Ipilimumab has been reported to cause high levels of adverse events (AEs), the most common of which are immune relate d[84]. Blockade of CTLA-4 may cause 
an increase in self-reactive T cells and autoimmunity leading to rash, vitiligo, 
diarrhea, colitis, uveitis, episcleritis, he patitis and hypophysitis.called immune 
related adverse events (irAEs).
The results of dose escalation studies have shown that increasing dosage 
correlates with increased efficacy as well as increased severity of irAEs. Roughly 60% of patients taking Ipilimumab experienced an irAE of any grade, with 10-15% of those grade 3 or 4 at the 3m g/kg dose. The most commonly reported 
adverse effects at the 3 mg/kg dose are grade I and II adverse events including rash, pruritus and diarrhea[84]. A cases se ries of 11 patients found an increased 
rate of transaminitis compared to the results from the Hodi et al trial[37]. Six of eleven patients had >Grade 1 elevations  of liver enzymes compared to only 3 
patients in the Hodi trial; four of eleven had grade 3 elevations compared to none 
in the Hodi trial[37].
irAEs can have a delayed onset and may be persistent. The reported median time 
to onset of an irAE depends on event type but ranges from 3.1 to 11 weeks. The median time to resolution of any grade II-IV event has been reported to be 4.9 weeks. Diarrhea, the most common irAE in clinical trials, has a median time to resolution of 1-2 weeks but it may be longer than 4 weeks for a grade III or IV event. The standard of care for treating irAEs is systemic administration of corticosteroids, as the majority of irAEs caused by ipilimumab can be resolved with steroids alone. Additional therapies that have been published include immune-suppressants, hormone replacement therapy for irAEs of the endocrine 
system, and intravenous immunoglobulin for immune-mediated blood disorders.

21Ipilimumab has been attributed to the death of 14 patients in the Hodi et al trial, 7 
of those due to immune related adverse events[37]. A boxed warning regarding the risk of enterocolitis, hepatitis, derma titis, neuropathies, a nd endocrinopathies 
is included with ipilimumab. A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for ipilimumab is mandated by the FDA to ensure that the benefits of ipilimumab outweigh the risk of these severe irAEs.
7.1.3 Ipilimumab Dosing
Ipilimumab will be dosed and scheduled according to FDA approved labels or per institutional guidelines at discretion of treating medical oncologist. For additional details regarding drug storage, prepar ation, and administration please refer to 
Ipilimumab package insert[84].
7.1.4 Treatment of Ipilimumab Related Infusion Reactions
Infusion reactions should be graded a ccording to CTCAE Version 4.0 Allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity criteria. Severe infusion reactions require the immediate 
interruption of ipilimumab therapy and permanent discontinuation from further treatment. Appropriate medical therapy including epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen should be available for use 
in the treatment of such reactions. Subjects should be carefully observed until the complete resolution of all signs and symptoms. In each case of an infusion reaction, the investigator should institu te treatment measures accord ing to the best available 
medical practice.
7.2 ANTI-PD-1/ ANTI-PD-L1 DRUG INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATION
7.2.1 Relevant Prior Clinical Information
Nivolumab (Opdivo) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody 
that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) cell surface membrane receptor, a 
negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes[85].
Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune 
responses and antigen-specific T cell respons es to both foreign antigens as well as 
self antigens. PD-1 receptor blockade by Nivolumab is an FDA approved approach for immunotherapy of advanced metastatic  melanoma, lung ca ncer, and renal cell 
carcinoma[85]. Nivolumab receiv ed FDA approval on March 4
th2015 for treatment 
of advanced squamous NSCLC that has pr ogressed after treatment with platinum-
based chemotherapy. In the phase II clin ical trial CheckMate-063, tumors shrank in 
15% of patients who took Opdivo, and 26% had stable disease. Additionally the 
phase III CheckMate-017 trial in which NSCLC patients received either docetaxel chemotherapy or Opdivo was stopped earl y after it became evident that nivolumab 
outperformed docetaxel.

7.2.2 Safety Profiles
7.2.2.1 Nivolumab
Patients have received nivolumab at  doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 20 
mg/kg intravenously every 2 week s with no maximal tolerated dose 
identified[85]. The incidence, seve rity and relationship of AEs are 
generally similar across dose levels and tumor types. Nivolumab related 
AEs of any grade occur in approximately 75% of subjects[85]. The most frequently reported AEs are fatigue (54.9%), decreased appetite (35.0%), 
diarrhea (34.3%), nausea (30.1%), and cough (29.4%). Most treatment-related AEs are low grade. Treatment-related high grade (Grade 3-4) AEs have been reported in  approximately. 17.0% of subjects. The most 
common treatment-related high grade AEs are fatigue (2.3%) and diarrhea (1%). Drug-related SAEs have been reported to occur in approximately in 11% of subjects. Se lect AE categories include: GI AEs, 
pulmonary AEs, renal AEs, hepatic AE s, skin AEs, and endocrinopathies. 
Patients who receive 10 mg/kg have had a numerically greater frequency of high-grade select AEs including the subcategories of endocrinopathies, 
GI, pulmonary, and infusion reaction.  High grade events have been 
reported to resolve following the treatment guidelines for the treatment of 
pulmonary events, GI events, hepatic events, renal events, and endocrine events, respectively. Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation have been reported in 10.5%, the most frequent of these were 
pneumonitis (2.6%) and colitis (1.0%)[85].

The most common adverse reactions with Pembrolizumab include 
fatigue, pruritus, rash, constipati on, diarrhea, nausea, and decreased 
appetite (Reported in >20% of patients) [86]. Pneumonitis has been reported to occur in approximately 2.9%  of melanoma patients, including 
Grade 2 or 3 cases in 1.9% and 0.2% of patients, respectively [86]. The 
median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months (range 0.3 
weeks-9.9 months). The median dura tion was 4.9 months (range1 week-
14.4 months). Five of eight patients with Grade 2 and one patient with 
Grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids  followed by a corticosteroid taper. The median initial dose of high-dose corticosteroid  treatment was 63.4 mg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent  with a median duration of treatment of 3 days 
(range 1-34) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of Pembrolizumab in  3 (0.7%) patients. Pneumonitis 
completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with Grade 2-3pneumonitis[86]. Colitis has been reported to occur in approximately 1% of patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 0.2% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. The median time to onset of colitis was 6.5 months (range 2.3-9.8). The median duration wa s 2.6 months (range 0.6 weeks-3.6
months). All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high-dose corticosteroids with a median initial dose of 70 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; the median duration of initial treatment was 7 days (range 4-41), followed by a corticosteroid taper. Hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) has been reported to occur in approximately 0.5% of patients, including  Grade 4 in 0.2% of patients. The time to onset was 22 days for the case of Grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. Hypophysitis has been reported to occur in approximately 0.5% ofpatients including Grade 2 and Grade 4 at at 0.2% each in patients. The time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Hypophysitis may require permanent hormone replacement therapy. Nephritis has been reported to occur in approximately 0.7% of patients, including Grade 2 
autoimmune nephritis (0.2%), and Grade 3 and Grade 4 interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%). All patients fully recovered renalfunction with treatment with high-dose corticosteroids  followed by a corticosteroid taper. Hyperthyroidism has been reported to occur in approximately 1.2% of pa tients, including Grade 2 or Grade 3 cases at 
0.5% and 0.2% respectively. The me dian time to onset was 1.5 months 
(range 0.5-2.1). The median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). 
The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions

2911 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
        11.1     Antitumor Effect-Solid Tumors
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response 8
weeks after the initial treatment, 16 weeks after treatment, and at 6 month intervals thereafter. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new
international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST 1.1) Committee (30). Changes in only the largest diameter
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST
criteria.
The RECIST read at 16 weeks will be used to determine the objective response rate
for the primary endpoint of this study.  
11.2 Definitions
Evaluable Population: will consist of all patients who have received at least 1
cycle of CBI with or without SBRT. 
Safety Population: Will consist of all subjects who were enrolled and have
received at least 1 cycle of CBI with or without SBRT. This will be used to
assess the clinical safety and tolerability of the study.
Evaluable for Objective Response: Patients who have measurable disease
present at baseline and have received at least 1 cycle of CBI , and have had theirdisease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients willhave their response classified according to the definitions stated below.
11.3 Disease Parameters
Measurable Disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded)as >0.5 cm with diagnostic techniques (CT, PET/CT (all are optional), or MRI).
All tumor measurements must be recorded in centimeters.
Non-Measurable Disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small
lesions (longest diameter <0.5 cm with diagnostic techniques), are considerednon-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites,pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis, inflammatory breast disease, andcystic lesions are all non-measurable. 
Target Lesions: Target lesion in this study will be considered metastatic sites up to a 
maximum of 3 lesions per patient. They should be recorded and measured at 
baseline. Target lesions should be equal to  or larger than 1.0 cm in the smallest 
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
30cross-sectional diameter on CT or MRI a nd/or any lesion that shows increase 
metabolic uptake on PET/CT scans. 
Non-Target Lesions: Non-Target lesion in this study will be considered metastatic 
sites up to a maximum of 10 lesions per patient. They should be recorded and 
measured at baseline. Non-target lesions should be equal to or larger than 0.5 cm in the smallest cross-sectional diameter on CT or MRI and/or any lesion that shows increase metabolic uptake on PET/CT scans. Importantly, a sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all non-target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD of the non-target lesions will be used as 
reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.
11.4 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation. All baselineevaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of
treatment and never more than 6 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination whenboth methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.
Conventional CT, PET/CT (all are optional), and MRI These techniques should be
performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CTshould be performed using a 5 m m contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies
to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
11.5 Response Criteria (via RECIST 1.1)
11.5.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all targeted and Non-Targeted lesions
Objective Response (OR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest
diameter (LD) of targeted and Non-targeted lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum LD
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of 
Targeted or Non- Targeted lesions, taking as reference
the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment
started or the appearance of one or more new lesions
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor
sufficient
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
31smallest sum LD since the treatment started
11.5.2 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference forprogressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatmentstarted). Best overall response will be based on the overall response of the Non-
targeted lesions.
11.5.3 Duration of Response
Response will be defined as evidence of CR, PR, or stable disease. Theduration of response will be measured from the start of treatment until thecriteria for progression are met.
Duration of CR or PR: The duration of CR or PR will be recorded from
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first
recorded) until the first date that current or progressive disease is objectivelydocumented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallestmeasurements recorded since the treatment started).
Duration of Stable Disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the
treatment and must be at least 6 mo nths in duration or until the criteria for
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recordedsince the treatment started.
11.5.4 Clinical Response Parameters
Time to Local Progression (TTLP) is defined as the elapsed time from the start
of treatment to the date of documented local progression or death, whicheverhappens earliest.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined is the time from starting treatment
to the time of first documented tumor progression or death due to any
cause, whichever occurs first. Death is considered as an event here. For
subjects whose disease does not progress or who do not die, PFS will be
censored at the time of the last visit.
Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from starting treatment to
the time of first documented tumor progression. Subjects who do not progress
will be censored at the time of the last contact. In addition, death from anycause will also be censored.
Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from starting treatment until death
due to any cause. For subjects who do not die, time to death will be censored
at the time of last contact.

All responses will be reviewed by the study co-investigator radiologist.
12 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
12.1      General
Adverse event collection and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. This
study will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI CommonTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events v ersion 4.0 (CTCAE v 4.0) that is available
at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting//ctc.html.
Information on all Grade 3 or greater adverse events, whether reported by theparticipant, directly observed, or detected by physical examination, laboratory testor other means, will be collected, recorded, followed and reported as described in the following sections. In addition, grade 1 and 2 adverse events treated with concomitant medicine/procedure or deemed to be of clinical  significance by a study investigator will 
be collected, recorded, followed and reported as described in the following sections.
Participants should be instructed to report any serious post-study event(s) that
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator shouldnotify the IRB and any other applicable regulatory agency of any unanticipateddeath or adverse event occurring after a participant has discontinued or terminatedstudy participation that may reasonably be related to the study.
12.2 Definitions
12.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of
study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is
not considered to be related to the study.
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only
if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostictests.
For this Phase II study only Grade 3 or higher adverse events, or grade 1 and 2 
adverse events treated with concomitant medicine/procedure,  or grade 1 and 2 adverse events deemed to be of clinical significance by a study investigator will be collected.
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
3312.2.2 Serious adverse event (SAE)
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition
which:
xis fatal or life-threatening;
xrequires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization;
xresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
xconstitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
xjeopardizes the participant and requires medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for:
xroutine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated withany deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures
xelective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen
xemergency outpatient  treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious
criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission
xrespite care
12.2.3 Expectedness
xExpected: Expected adverse events are those that have been previously
identified as resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes ofthis study, an adverse event is considered expected when it appears in the
current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or isincluded in the informed consent document as a potential risk.
xUnexpected: An adverse event is considered unexpected when it varies in
nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverseevent list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is notincluded in the informed consent document as a potential risk
12.2.4 Attribution
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:
xDefinite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
xProbable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
xPossible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.
xUnlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.
xUnrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
12.3 Potential Adverse Events
Signs and symptoms of disease progression are not considered AEs. The development
of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE. New cancers are those that arenot the primary reason for administration of study treatment and have been
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
34identified after inclusion of the patient into the clinical study.
Because patients are receiving standard treatments, which are not part of this study,
their treating physician will be counseling them on the risk of their treatments,including the risk of surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, whichever isappropriate for the type and the stage of the ir cancer. The procedures related to the
study are phlebotomy, PET imaging (all are optional), SBRT, and CBI administration.
Phlebotomy can cause pain, bleeding, and r are needle site infection. PET imaging
results in low dose radiation exposure (see Investigator’s Brochure for details of
dosimetry), which has an extremely small risk of causing a secondary cancer.
12.4 Stereotactic Body Radiation Treatment
It is difficult at this time to predict with confidence the complication rate from theproposed SBRT; however, it is reasonable to extrapolate from the current experience
and reported literature with SBRT. One significant toxicity is radiation pneumonitis,
which can be manifested as fever, increased excertional dypsnea, pleuritic chest pain,
and peritumoral infiltrate on chest imaging. It generally occurs between 1 to 3
months of completion of radiotherapy. The risk of grade 2-4 radiation pneumonitis is
aproximately 10-15% in patients treated with standard fractionated large field
radiotherapy and higher in patients treated with combined chemoradiotherapy. It ishighly dependent on the volume of the lung treated to high dose and the mean
lung dose. At this point, the incidence of RT pneumonitis from SBRT combined 
with immunotherapy for small pulmonary tumors is unknown. However, if the
treated tumor volume is kept 65 cc, the risk should be <10-15% with the proposed
dose level.
Other toxicities commonly associated with such treatment includes colitis, diarrhea, 
hypophysitis, rash, arthritis, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss. Some
of these symptoms can also be due to tumor progression. Clinical and radiographic
assessments will be performed as indicated to identify all adverse effects, ascertain
their etiology, and provide the most appropriate palliative measures. Complications
orther than radiation pneumonitis, if any, will be graded according to the Common
Toxicity Criteria, National Cancer Institute, version 4.0.
12.5 Reporting Procedures
12.5.1 General
Adverse events will be recorded at each visit. If an adverse event requiring
medical attention occurs between visits, this will be recorded as well. Thevariables to be recorded for each adverse event include, but are not limited to,onset, resolution, intensity, action taken, outcome, causality rating and whether itconstitutes an SAE or not. The intensity of the adverse event should becaptured using CTCAE criteria, version 4.0, when possible.

CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
36subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it, and
will be given a copy of the document. No subject will enter the study or have
study-specific procedures done before his/her informed consent has been obtained.
In accordance with the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA), the written informed consent document (or a separate documentto be given in conjunction with the consent document) will include a subjectauthorization to release medical information to the study sponsor andsupporting agencies and/or allow these bodies, a regulatory authority, orInstitutional Review Board access to subjects’ medical information that includesall hospital records relevant to the study, including subjects’ medical history.
14.3 Ethics and GCP
This study will be carried out in compliance with the protocol and Good ClinicalPractice, as described in:
1. ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 1996.
2. US 21 Code of Federal Regulations dealing with clinical studies (including
parts 50 and 56 concerning informed consent and IRB regulations).
3. Declaration of Helsinki, concerning medical research in humans
(Recommendations Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving 
Human Subjects, Helsinki 1964, amended Tokyo 1975, Venice 1983, HongKong 1989, Somerset West 1996).
The investigators agree to adhere to the instructions and procedures described in
it and thereby to adhere to the principles of Good Clinical Practice that it conforms
to.
15 ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1 Endpoints
15.1.1 Primary Objectives
To determine whether SBRT combined with concurrent CBI improves the objective response rate compared to CBI alone in patients with metastatic disease.
15.1.2 Secondary Objectives
oTo assess the safety and toxicity of  CBI used concurrently with SBRT 
delivered in the population enrolled using grading with CTCAE v. 4.0
oTo assess progression free survival and overall survival in patients after 
completion of SBRT in combination with CBI. Progression-free survival
will be measured from time of enrollm ent to date of disease progression
or death. Patients who are lost to follow-up will be censored fordetermination of progression-free survival on the date of their last
evaluation. Overall survival is defined as time from enrollment to death
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
37due to any cause.
oTo assess the rates of stable disease gr eat than or equal to 6 months  during 
and after SBRT in combination with CBI compared to CBI alone
oTo determine whether SBRT combined with concurrent CBI results 
improvements in anti-tumor immune responses compared to CBI alone
15.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate
The primary endpoint will be objective response rate at 16 weeks. The treatmentregimen would be considered of insufficient activity for further study in this
population if the 16 week objective response is 10% less than historical controls. 
The objective response rate to CBI monotherapy depends on disease type and is 
reported to be approximately 40% in melanoma and 20-25% in NSCLC. Dual agent 
checkpoint blockade has recently been shown to have a response rate of 61% in 
Metastatic melanoma. In order to detect a cumulative relative 33% increase in 
objective response rate [i.e. from 61% to 81% (for dual agent), 40% to 53% for 
single agent in melanoma, and 25% to 33% in NSCLC] with a one tailed p value 
<0.05% with 80% power incorporating the respective frequencies of tumor types this 
would require 146 patients total. 
15.3 Safety Run-In Phase
There is no significant published experience with SBRT used concurrently withCBI in this study population. Therefore, to ensure that the combination is safe, the
first six patients will be treated and observed for toxicity for 30 days after
radiation before continuing with further accrual. 6 patients will be enrolled at the
proposed dose of CBI and SBRT. If 3 toxicity events occur in the first 6
patients within 30 days of therapy, we proceed with additional accrual with thisregimen to complete a total of 146 patients. If 4 toxicity events occur among
the first 6 patients, we will suspend the study pending data review.
Toxicity Event: JUDGH 3 adverse event (CTCAE v 4.0) with an attribution of
possible, probable, or definite.
15.4 Early Stopping Guidelines:
This study will monitor site-specific grade 4/5 toxicity. If it becomes evidentthat the proportion of grade 4/5 toxicity at specific sites convincingly exceeds30%, the study will be halted for a safety consultation. Specifically, we willapply a Bayesian toxicity monitoring rule that suspends the enrollment if theposterior probability of toxicity being larger than 30% threshold is 75% or higher.
15.5 Analysis of Primary Objectives
The primary efficacy analysis will be the objective response rate of SBRT combined with concurrent CBI compared to CBI alone in patients with metastatic disease. Objective response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of Non-Targeted lesion/lesions, taking as reference the
CBI and SBRT
Protocol PI: Andrew Sharabi, M.D.,Ph.D
March 4, 2019 (Version 9.0)
38baseline sum LD. The analysis population includes all registered subjects who have
received the three fractions of SBRT.
15.6 Analysis of Secondary Objectives
oFor safety analysis, adverse events will be summarized by type and grade.
oTo determine whether SBRT combined with concurrent CBI results in statistically 
significant improvements in anti-tumor imm une responses compared to CBI alone 
we will perform immunologic assays quantifying lymphocyte specificity and 
activation, including Immune cell Sequenc ing, ProtoArrays, Immunoassays, and
multiparametric flow cytometry.
oHazard rate estimates and 95% confidence intervals as well as Kaplan-Meier
(KM) estimates will be used to summarize survival (OS), progression free
survival (PFS), time to loco regional progression (TTLP) and time to distant
progression (TTDP), duration of response functions over time, and stable disease 
(SD). The median OS, PFS, TTLP, TTDP, and SD will be reported.
15.7 Evaluation of Toxicity
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment of CBI.
15.8 Evaluation of Response
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if
there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patientwill be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partialresponse, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignantdisease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 8)unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of
those who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of
the response rate. Patients in response ca tegories 4-8 should be considered to have a
treatment failure (disease progression).
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. Sub-analyses may then be
performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom majorprotocol deviations have been identified (e .g., early death due to other reasons, early
discontinuation of treatment, major protoc ol violations, etc.). However, these sub-
analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatmentefficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearlyreported. The reason for performing subset analyses would be to generate hypothesesfor future prospective clinical trials.

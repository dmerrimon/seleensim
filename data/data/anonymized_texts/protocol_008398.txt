1.1 Study Objectives :   71 
To assess the effect of using Fiasp®  in a closed- loop system:  72 
Part 1:  To assess how the 670G system adapts to the introduction of Fias p® 73 
insulin  74 
Part 2:  To assess changes experienced clinicians will make to the use of Fiasp®  75 
insulin in the 670G pump 76

1.2 BACKGROUND INFORMAT ION 79 
1.2.1 Fiasp ®  80 
Faster -acting insulin aspart (faster aspart or Fiasp®) is insulin aspart in a new formulation 81 
that contains two well -known excipients  generally  recognized as  safe (GRAS), niacinamide 82 
and L-arginine. These are both listed in the US Food and Drug Administration inactive 83 
ingredient database, in products for injection, at higher concentrations than used in Fiasp®.  84 
With Fiasp® , niacinamide is considered responsible for faster initial absorption after 85 
subcutaneous administration and L- arginine serves as a stabilizing agent. In subjects with 86 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM),  Fiasp® administered by subcutaneous injection had 87 
twice -as-fast onset of appearance, a 2-fold higher early exposure, and >50% greater early 88 
glucose-lowering effect compared with insulin aspart 1,2. When Fiasp® is administered by 89 
subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy, the rapid onset of action is even more 90 
pronounc ed.  The time to half-maximal activity was reduced by 11.8 minutes, the time to 91 
peak activity was reduced by 25.7 minutes , and the duration of insulin activity was reduced 92 
by 35.4 minutes  when compared to insulin aspart 3 (see Figure 1 below). 93 
 94 
Figure 1-1:  Fiasp®  Pharmacokinetics .  A bolus of 0.15 U/kg of aspart (grey) (n=46) or  95 
Fiasp®  (blue) (n=44) was given subcutaneously by an insulin pump and serum insulin 96 
concentrations were measure. 97 
 98 
In a 6 week double-blind, randomized, crossover active-controlled trial comparing aspart to  99 

Fiasp®  using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump therapy, the  Fiasp®  100 
two hour post prandial glucose levels were significantly lower following a standardized meal 101 
test 4 (Figure 1-2)  102 
 103 
Figure 1-2: Mean bas eline-adj usted plasma glucose levels following either insulin aspart (in 104 
grey) or  Fiasp®  (in blue) given as an insulin pump bolus at the onset of a standardized 105 
liquid meal (Boost) which h as 102 grams of CHO.  The bolus calculator in their pump was 106 
used for each meal dose. 107 
 108 
The more rapid onset of action and shorter duration could be very beneficial to full closed- 109 
loop control allowing an earlier onset of insulin action to cover the postprandial glucose rise, 110 
and decreasing the residual insulin after a meal to prevent late hypoglycemia.   Fiasp® has 111 
not been tested in a hybrid closed- loop system. 112 
Fiasp® was approved by the FDA on September 29, 2017 for people with type 1 and type 2 113 
diabetes in a pre-filled FlexTouch® pen and in 10 ml vials.  It was approved to be given by 114 
injection, but not for use in pumps.  In Europe it was approved for use by injections and in 115 
insulin infusion pumps.  In both the US and Europe it was approved for use in pregnancy.  116 
There has been one study published on pump compatibility of Fiasp® 5 which showed a 117 
premature end of infusion set wear in 10% of 210 Fiasp® infusions, and 4% of 98 aspart 118 
infusions (p=ns).   119 
 120 
1.2.2 Medtronic 670G Hybrid Closed- loop 121 
The Medtronic 670G hybrid closed loop system is the first fully integrated system designed 122 
for continuous day and night closed -loop control.  The sy stem requires meal announcement 123 
with an estimate of carbohydrate intake and a premeal insulin bolus to optimize glucose 124 
excursions.  We published the first results of using this system in 2015 in adolescents 125 
attending a diabetes camp 6, and the 670G system was approved for commercial sale by 126 
the FDA on September 28th, 2016.  We have had adolescents using this system  for 2 ½ 127 
years, 7-14 year olds using the system for 15 months, and 5 to 6 year olds have been using 128 

this system at Stanford for over 3 months as part of the pivotal trials with extended use of 129 
the system after the initial 3 month pivotal  phase.  Both the adult and pediatric clinics now 130 
have patients using the 670G system.   131

 136 
The safety and effectiveness of the in-home use of a hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system was 137 
investigated in adolescents (n = 30, ages 14– 21 years) and adults (n = 94, ages 22– 75 138 
years) w ith type 1 diabetes in a multicenter pivotal trial  7. The 670G  system was used 139 
during a 2-week run-in phase without HCL control, or Auto Mode, enabled (Manual Mode) 140 
and then in Auto Mode during a 3- month study phase.  Data from the trial is seen below, in 141

The adolescents  used the system for a median 75.8%  of the time, and adults used the 146 
system for a median 88.0% of the time. From baseline run-in to the end of study phase the 147 
adolescent HbA1c decreased from 7.7% to 7.1% (P < 0.001) and adult HbA1c levels 148 
decreased from 7.3% to 6.8% (P < 0.001).  The proportion of overall in-target (71– 180 149 
mg/dL) sensor glucose (SG) values increased from 60.4% to 67.2% (P < 0.001) in 150 
adolescents  and from 68.8% to 73.8% (P < 0.001) in adults. Figure 1-4 provides a graph of 151 
the sensor values for both adolescent and adult subjects comparing their baseline data to 152 
their data using the 670G.  There were no severe hypoglycemic or  diabetic ketoacidosis 153 
events in either cohort.  154

 161 
1.2.3 Use Of A Standard Breakfast To Assess Insulin Pharmacodynamics Data 162 
In An Outpatient Setting.  163 
In a study to assess the effect of hyaluronidase administration on insulin 164 
pharmacodynamics, 14 subjects were instructed to eat the same breakfast meal each day, 165 
give an insulin bolus based on their usual insulin-to -carbohydrate ratio and correction 166 
factor, and they were instructed not to eat for at least 3 hours following breakfast.  Subjects 167 
were required to document their food intake each morning at breakfast and the 168 
carbohydrate content was verified on the pump download bolus history.  Postprandial 169 
glucodynamic parameters including peak glucose concentration (C max), time to C max (tmax), 170 
A
and estimated average glucose excursions were assessed using sensor glucose values at 171 
a time interval of 0 to 180 minutes after breakfast bolus.  If a bolus was given between 120- 172 
180 minutes following the breakfast bolus, CGM values were only used up to the time of the 173 
bolus.  The glucose at the time of the breakfast bolus (Time 0) was set to 0 mg/dL for each 174 
meal, and the remaining CGM values were adjusted proportionally to allow analysis of 175 
postprandial glucodynamic parameters.  We utilized a mixed-effects model ac counting for 176 
crossover study design of the study with the sequence of treatment nested within the 177 
patient, and this was the random effect.  Breakfast meals were excluded from postprandial 178 
analysis if: 1) the rate of change was greater than 0.5mg/d L/min in the 1 hour prior to 179 
breakfast, 2) subjects gave a subsequent bolus prior to 120 minutes following the breakfast 180 
bolus, or 3) subjects deviated from their typical breakfast.  181 
For the postprandial glucose analysis (Table 2)  there were limited observations available, 182 
but the estimated average glucose excursion was less for hyaluronidase compared to 183 
standard weeks on Day 1 of infusion set life (12- 24 hours after the first hyaluronidase 184 
infusion) and Day 3 of infusion set life (immediately after second hyaluronidase infusion).  185 
This effect was lost on Day 2 of infusion set life (36-48 hours after the first hyaluronidase 186 
infusion) and Day 4 of infusion set life (24 hours after the second hyaluronidase infusion). 187 
The study was not powered to show a difference in glucodynamic parameters, but Cmax 188 
and tmax tended to be lower immediately after hyaluronidase infusions.  Postprandial 189 
profiles obtained from CGM glucose values are presented in mean ± standard error for 190 
meals analyzed on Days 1-4 of infusion set life in Fi gure 3.  There were too few meals 191 
available for analysis beyond Day 4 of infusion set life to allow postprandial analysis.  192

1.3 Study Overview  210 
 211 
Use of Fiasp®:  Fiasp® insulin has been approved for sale in the USA , and has been 212 
available since February 7th 2018.  Although it is not approved for pumps, it will be used in 213 
pumps off-label because of it has a more rapid onset of action.  The 670G closed-loop 214 
system automati cally adjusts basal rates throughout the day and night to minimize hyper 215 
and hypoglycemia.  Use of the 670G provides a unique opportunity to assess how  Fiasp® 216 
works in a closed-loop system and to determine if any changes need to be made to the 217 
670G pump to optimize the use of Fiasp®.  218 
 219 
According to the FDA guidelines we do not think this study requires an IND since we meet 220 
all of the following six conditions:      221 
i. it is not intended to be reported to FDA in support of a new indication for use or to 222 
support any other significant change in the labeling for the drug; 223 
ii. it is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product;  224 
iii. it does not involve a route of administration (it is still being given subcutaneously) or 225 
dosage level, use in a subject population, or other factor that significantly increases 226 
the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the 227 
drug product; 228 
iv. it is conducted in compliance with the requirements for IRB review and informed 229 
consent [21 CFR parts 56 and 50, respectively]; 230 
v. it is conducted in compliance with the requirements concerning the promotion and 231 
sale of drugs [21 CFR 312.7]; and  232 
vi. it does not intend to invoke 21 CFR 50.24.”  233 
  234 
 235 
1.4 Protocol Synopsis:  236 
 237 
This is a pilot  outpatient  study conducted at Stanford to obtain preliminary data on 238 
how Fiasp®  works in a closed- loop system. The plan will be to enroll up to 20  239 
subjects  for each part of the study .  Part 1 is a blinded cross -over study to assess 240 
how well Fiasp®  insulin works when used with the 670G pump compared to aspart 241 
insulin and will take 6 weeks for a subject to complete.  Part 2 is a Fiasp® 242 
optimization phase to assess if making changes to meal coverage with the 243 
knowledge that Fiasp®  is being used can optimize the advantage s of the 670G 244 
pump with Fiasp® use , and to observe longer term use of Fiasp®  in the 670G 245 
pump. This will be a 6 week  study .    246 
 247 
Part 1:  Randomized cross -over, blinded study which includes  assessment of meal 248 
pharmacodynamics . 249 
Part 1 will be a randomized cr oss-over blinded study and will also t est to see how  250 
the 670G pump responds to the introduction of Fiasp®  insulin.  Subjects enrolled in 251 
the study will have a 2 week period of optimization with weekly assessments of their 252 
Carelink download before entering the blinded phase of the study.  They will use 253 
their usual home insulin during the optimization phase.  They will then been started 254 
on their first blinded insulin (aspart or Fiasp® ) which they will use for 2 weeks, 255 
before they cross -over to the other insulin.  During the second week of each arm we 256 
will: 257 
1)  Assess CGM measurements of:  258 
a) time in range (70- 180 mg/dl)  259 
b) percent time <70 mg/dl,  260 
c) mean glucose,  261 
d) glucose CV,  262 
2) Pump data for:   263 
a) CHO:I ratios at Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner,   264 
b) total daily insulin dose,  265 
c) total daily basal insulin,  266 
d) insulin delivery form MN to 6AM, and 6AM to MN  267 
3) We will test to see if there is any difference in pharmacodynamics  when 268 
using Fiasp®  in the home environment when they are eating their usual  269 
breakfast .   270 
4) We will also assess their glucose levels  following a high fat meal  at dinner of 271 
at least 30 grams of fat.   272 
 273 
Part II:   Extended Use Observational Study.  274 
This study  will consist of  6 weeks  of closely monitored home use of the 670G pump 275 
with review of their pump and sensor downloads every 2 weeks by clinicians who 276 
are experienced in using the 670G pump.  The goals of this phase of the study are 277 
to:     278 
1) Assess how Fiasp®  changes meal bolusing, i.e. do adjustments need to be 279 
made in their carbohydrate to insulin ratios or timing of their boluses when 280 
they are using Fiasp®   I 281 
2) Assess how Fiasp®  works with the higher fat meals that may occur with 282 
dinner, i.e. will the dinner d ose need to be divided into early and late boluses  283 
3) Assess how Fiasp®  affects infusion sites under usual care conditions, i.e are 284 
there any local reactions to Fiasp®  285 
4) Assess if  Fiasp®  becomes less effective  over the life an infusion set  (are sets 286 
changed more frequently)    287 
5) Assess how the 670G performs when Fiasp®  is used:   288 
a. Do insulin -to-carbohydrate ratios need to be modified  289 
b. Does duration of insulin action need to be modified  290 
c. Is more or less basal insulin delivered 291 
d. Does the total daily  dose change  292 
e. Does  the performance of the 670G change overnight (MN to 6AM) 293 
and during the day (6AM to MN) in terms of time in range, mean 294 
glucose and % of readings <70 mg/dL.  295 
 296 
will include both males and females and an enrollment goal will be to achieve an 297 
approximately equal sex distribution.  Their total daily insulin dose should be at least 298 
0.3 units/kg/day and they should be eating at least 60 grams of carbohydrate each 299 
day. 300 
 301

Recruitment Plan:  372 
We will contact subjects at our clinic who are using the 670G system  and are using 373 
Novolog or Fiasp®  insulin .  A short description of the present study will be given to 374 
them via email, phone or in- person.  If the subject expresses interest, then the study 375 
will be presented in detail.  The goal will be to enroll four subjects each week to 376 
establish cohorts of 4 subjects.  377 
  378 
Informed Consent Plan and HIPAA Authorizations:  379 
The subject will be allowed sufficient time to read over the IRB approved consent 380 
form, and given opportunity to have all questions answered.  The consent will 381 
contain a brief description of the research project, as well as the procedures and 382 
treatments to  be undertaken, and the risks of each treatment and procedure.  383 
Consent form will be obtained by delegated research staff. The PI and study staff 384 
will be available to fully discuss consent with the subjects as needed.  Subjects 385 
have the right to withdraw at any time during the study.  The subject  will be provided 386 
with the Informed Consent Form to read and will be given the opportunity to ask 387 
questions.  If the subject agrees  to participate, the Informed Consent Form will be 388 
signed.  A copy of the consent fo rm will be provided to the subject and another copy 389 
will be added to the subject’s clinic chart.    Written informed consent must be 390 
obtained from the subject prior  to performing any study -specific procedures that are 391 
not part of the subject’s routine care.   392 
 393 
Eligibility Assessment and Baseline Data Collect ion 394 
Potential subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility through the elicitation of a 395 
medical history, performance of a physical examination by study personnel . 396 
  397 
Historical Information and Physical Exam  398 
A history will be elicited from the subject and/or extracted from available medical 399 
records with regard to the subject’s diabetes history, current diabetes management, 400 
other past and current medical problems, past and current medications, and drug 401 
allergies.  A study focused physical exam (including height,  weight measurements  402 
and infusion site assessments ) will be performed by the study investigator or 403 
designee (an attending physician, fellow, nurse practitioner or a physician 404 
assistant).  405 
 406 
HbA1c  407 
A point of care HbA1c level will be obtained at the time of enrollment, at the start of 408 
the 3 month observational study and at the end of the observational study .   409 
 410 
Authorization Procedures  411 
As part of the informed consent process, each subject  will be asked to sign an 412 
authorization for release of personal information.  The investigator, or his or her 413 
designee, will review what study specific information will be collected and to whom 414 
that information will be disclosed.  After speaking with the s ubject, questions will be 415 
answered about the details regarding authorization.  416 
  417 
CHAPTER 3:   PROTOCOL P ROCEDURES  418 
 419 
 420 
Visit 1:   Informed consent  process :    421 
Informed consent process:  The protocol will be reviewed with the subjects, they will 422 
be given time to read the informed consent and ask any questions about the study.   423 
 424 
History and physical exa m: Including age at diagnosis of diabetes, duration of 425 
diabet es, any retinal, renal or cardiac conditions.  H eight, weight, and examination 426 
of skin where infusion sets are inserted.    427 
 428 
Laboratory tests :  Point of care A1c will be obtained and urine pregnancy test will be 429 
obtained on all women who are pre- menopausal.  430 
 431 
Training on home procedures:  432 
 433 
Blood glucose monitoring:  Subjects will test blood glucose using a Bayer Contour 434 
Next Link home glucose meter at least 3 times daily.  Subjects will be instructed to 435 
check blood ketones using a blood ketone meter if there is unexplained sensor 436 
hyperglcyem ia and the blood glucose meter reading is greater than 250 mg/dL.  437 
 438 
Calibration of Guardian Sensor:  They will be instructed to calibrate the Guardian 439 
sensor before breakfast and before dinner each day when there are no rate of 440 
change arrows and after washing their hands or using the second drop of blood.  441 
They will also be instructed to calibrate if the Guardian is showing more than a 20% 442 
error when compared to their Contour Next blood glucose reading and the Guardian 443 
is not showing a rapid rate of change.  444 
 445 
Replacement of Guardian Sensor:  If the Guardian sensor stops functioning during 446 
the study, the subjects will insert a new sensor.   447 
 448 
Determination of an infusion set failure:    449 
They will be instructed to replace the infusion set if:  450 
1. Their ketone level is greater than 0.6 mmol/L,  451 
2. There is evidence of infection at the infusion site 452 
3. Their blood glucose (meter) does not decrease by at least 50 mg/dL within 1 453 
hour of a correction bolus for unexplained hyperglycemia with  a blood 454 
glucose greater than 250 mg/dL.  455 
4. There is a pump occlusion alarm.  456 
 457 
Documentation of infusion site reactions:  At home they will exam the infusion set 458 
site at time of infusion set failure for signs of infection.  They will record bleeding, 459 
redness, induration, and bruising in mm, and call one of the investigators if there is 460 
more than 10 mm of erythema or induration.  They will be given a ruler for making 461 
these measurements. If there is more than 3 mm of induration or redness they will 462 
be asked to take a picture and enter these measurments into a text to the study 463 
coordinator or submit the i nformation directly into RedCap.   464 
 465 
The goal will be to have sensor wear at least 80% of the time and in automode at 466 
least 70% of the time.  There pump will be uploaded to a resear ch Carelink account 467 
each week.  While in the blinded phase of the study the clinical staff will refrain from 468 
making changes to 670G pump settings unless requested by the subject or for 469 
safety reasons such as an episode of severe hypoglcyemia (unconscousnes s or 470 
seizure), >10% time <70 mg/dl, or >20% of the time over 250 mg/dl.   471 
 472 
Part 1:  Randomized,  cross- over, blinded study to assess any adaptations of 473 
the 670G pump to Fiasp® and to assess meal pharmacodynamics of Fiasp®  474 
compared to aspart with a typical breakfast in the home environment  475 
 476 
Participants will have a 2 week run- in on their usual home insulin (aspart of Fiasp® ).  477 
During the run- in, there pump will be downloaded weekly, reviewed by the clinical 478 
staff and adjustments will be made to their settings as needed to optimize their 479 
glycemic control.  P articipants will then be randomly assigned to 2 sequences of 480 
testing starting with either aspart or Fiasp® .  They will use each insulin for two 481 
weeks.  The participants  and the investigators will be blinded to the insulin.  During 482 
the second week of using a blinded insulin they will have the meal 483 
pharmacodynamics testing.  They will then cross -over to the other insulin and 484 
during the second week they will repeat meal pharmacodynamics testing.  At the 485 
end of each week they will upload their 670G pump to a Carelink clinical (research) 486 
account and it will be reviewed by the res earch staff  for safety purposes .   487 
 488 
Procedure for meal testing.  For each week of meal testing they will be asked to 489 
have 3 days with a consistent breakfast that is the same for all 6 days they are 490 
doing a meal test  (3 days on each insulin) .  The breakfast  studies should ideally 491 
occur on standard work days (not holidays or weekends).  On these three days they 492 
will be asked to have a dinner with at least 30 grams of fat and no additional food in 493 
the evening (unless they are treating hypoglycemia).  They will  be asked to take a 494 
picture of the dinner meal and identify their food and portion sizes .  If they have a 495 
smart phone (Android or Apple),  they may download Calorie Mamma® or Calorie 496 
King® to help them in calculating carbohydrates, protein and fat from the meal.  497 
They will do this for each of their dinner meals  on each of the days they are doing 498 
the breakfast study , and for the breakfast meal s they are eating each morning as 499 
part of the pharmacodynamic testing.  They will change their infusion set before 500 
dinner prior to the first day of starting a standard breakfast, i.e., i f they work from 501 
Monday to Friday, this could be done on Sunday.  502 
 503 
They are blinded to the insulin and the insulin dose decisions for these meals is also 504 
not under their control since:  1)  The overnight insulin delivery is not under their 505 
control, 2) The timing of the meal bolus will be the same for all mornings, the dose 506 
will be given immediately before eating, 3) They dose of insulin will be determined 507 
by their pump using their preset insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio and they will be eating 508 
the same amount of carbohydrates each morning.  They also will not be getting a 509 
correction dose of insulin in the morning because they are using the closed- loop 510 
controller overnight.  If they required a correction dose of insulin, we will not use the 511 
data from that morning in our data analysis.   We will assess during each of these 512 
four weeks the time in- range (70- 180 mg/dl), mean glucose, CV, and time <70 513 
mg/dl.   514 
 515 
At the end of each two week period of blinded insulin use the participants and the 516 
health care providers will be given a questionnaire asking them which insulin they 517 
thought they were using, and if they had noticed any advantages to disadvantages 518 
while they were using this insulin, and whether  they would have wanted to make 519 
any changes to their insulin delivery settings while using the insulin.  520 
 521 
 522 
Part 2: Extended Use O ptimization  Study   523 
 524 
To be eligible for Part 2 one of the inclusion criteria will be that the subject is 525 
currently using Fiasp® i nsulin under their usual care.  Subjects for Part 1 may 526 
participate in part 2, and we will also recruit subjects outside of part 2 who are 527 
currently using a 670G pump and taking Fiasp insulin.  They will download their 528 
670G pump to a research Carelink account every 2 weeks.  Their data will be 529 
reviewed within 3 days by the clinicians managing the study at each research 530 
clinical site.  An email, text or phone call will be made to the subject after reviewing 531 
their pump/sensor data.  Recommendations for dosage changes will be recorded on 532 
a case report form or directly into RedCap.  The  study investigators will meet every 533 
2 to 4 weeks during the study to review clinical issues and insights that have been 534 
observed.   535 
 536 
To assess the long term effect of using Fiasp ® on infusion sites and insulin action, 537 
they will be asked to use Fiasp®  as long as they see benefit in using it after the 538 
initial meal boluses testing is completed.  Each time they change their infusion set, 539 
we will ask them to examine the site for any bl eeding, redness or induration, and 540 
measure these changes and take a picture if there are any findings.  (See 541 
Documentation of infusion site reactions).  We will have them download to a 542 
CareLink research data base every two weeks to look at their total dail y insulin 543 
requirements, glucose values, and basal insulin requirements with extended use of 544 
Fiasp® .  They will have an email sent to them every 2 weeks by RedCap to assess 545 
for issues they have observed while using Fiasp® .   546 
 547 
Documentation of infusion site reactions:  At home subjects will exam the ir infusion 548 
set site when they are changing an infusion set and assess for bleeding, signs of a 549 
local tissue reaction or infection.  They will record redness, induration, and bruising 550 
in mm, and call one of the investigators if there is more than 10 mm of erythema or 551 
induration.  They will be given a ruler for making these measurements. If there is 552 
more than 3 mm of indurati on or redness they will be asked to take a picture and 553 
enter these measurements and send a text to the study coordinator or submit the 554 
information directly into RedCap.   555 
 556 
They will be instructed to replace the infusion set if:  557 
1. Their ketone level is greater than 0.6 mmol/L,  558 
2. There is evidence of infection at the infusion site 559 
3. Their blood glucose (meter) does not decrease by at least 50 mg/dL within 1 560 
hour of a correction bolus for  unexplained hyperglycemia with a blood 561 
glucose greater than 250 mg/dL.  562 
4. There is a pump occlusion alarm.  563 
  564 
CHAPTER 4:  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND PROTOCOL MONITORING  565 
 566 
Definition  567 
A reportable adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that meets criteria 568 
for a serious adverse event or any unexpected medical occurrence in a st udy 569 
subject that is study or device- related.  Skin irritation from sensor wear will be 570 
recorded in specific sections of the case report forms.  An adverse event form is 571 
only completed if skin irritation is severe or antibiotics are required.   572 
 573 
Hypoglycemic events are recorded as Adverse Events if the event required 574 
assistance of another person due to altered consciousness to actively administer 575 
carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.  This means that the subject 576 
was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat him or herself, 577 
was unable to verbalize his or her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or 578 
combative, or experienced seizure or coma.  These episodes may be associated 579 
with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma.  If plasma glucose 580 
measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery 581 
attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient 582 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasm a glucose concentration.   583 
 584 
Hyperglycemic events are recorded as Adverse Events if the event involved diabetic 585 
ketoacidosis ( DKA) , as defined by the DCCT, and had all of the following:  586 
1) Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting 587 
2) Serum ketones  greater than 1.6 mM,  or large/moderate urine ketones  588 
3) Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15 589 
4) Treatment provided in a health care facility  590 
 591 
Recording of Adverse Events  592 
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made to remain alert to 593 
possible adverse events or untoward findings.  The first concern will be the safety of 594 
the subject, and appropriate medical intervention will be made.  595 
 596 
The investigator will elicit reports of adverse events from the subject at each visit 597 
and complete all adverse event forms online.  Each adverse event form is reviewed 598 
by the Coordinating Center  to verify the coding and the reporting that is required.       599 
 600 
The study investigator will assess the relationship of any adverse event to be 601 
related or unrelated by determining if there is a reasonable possibility that the 602 
adverse event may have been caused by the study device or study procedures.    603 
 604 
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three- point scale: (1) mild, (2) 605 
moderate, or (3) severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of 606 
intensity: thus a severe adverse event is not necessarily serious.  For example, 607 
itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.   608 
 609 
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of 610 
the study will be followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no 611 
further change in the condition is expected.   612 
 613 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dict ionary.  614 
 615 
Definitions of relationship and intensity are listed on the website data entry form.   616 
 617 
Adverse events that continue after the subject’s discontinuation or completion of the 618 
study will be followed until their medical outcome is determined or unti l no further 619 
change in the condition is expected.   620 
  621 
Reporting Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events  622 
A serious adverse event is any untoward occurrence that:   Results in death;  is life- 623 
threatening (a non life- threatening  event which, had it been more severe, might 624 
have become life- threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse 625 
event) ; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 626 
results in a disability or permanent damage w hich causes  a substantial disruption of 627 
a person's ability to conduct normal life functions ; results in  a congenital 628 
anomaly/birth defect ;  requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or 629 
damage (Devices) ; or any other serious (Important Medical E vent) which may 630 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) 631 
to prevent a serious adverse event.  632 
 633 
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Event  is defined as an adverse event caused by, 634 
or associated with, a device, if that effect or problem was not previously identified in 635 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence.  636 
 637 
Serious or unexpected adverse events must be reported to the Principal 638 
Investigator immediately .  639 
Bruce Buckingham, M.D.  640 
Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes  641 
780 Welch Road, Room CJ320H  642

Office Phone 650- 725-6549  644 
Office Fax 650- 736-6690 645 
 646 
The principle investigator will notify all participating investigators of any adverse 647 
device event that is both serious and unexpected. Notification will be made within 648 
10 days after becoming aware of the event.  649 
 650 
Dr. Buckingham will inform the IRB of serious study -related adverse events and 651 
abide by any other reporting requirements specific to their IRB.  652 
 653 
Potential Risks and Side Effects 654 
There may be a higher frequency of hypoglycemia immediately following a meal bolus.  655 
There may be prolonged hyperglycem ia following a high fat meal. There may be local tissue 656 
reactions at the FIASP®  infusion sites.  Infusion sites may need to be changed more 657 
frequently than usual when infusing FIASP® .  As with any insulin, there is a risk for both 658 
high and low blood glucos e levels occurring if there is a mismatch between your insulin 659 
needs and the insulin levels provided by the insulin.  See hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 660 
risks below.  It is very rare, but allergic reactions to insulin may occur.   661 
 662 
Risk of Hypoglycemia 663 
As with any person having insulin -dependent diabetes, there is always a risk of 664 
having a low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).  The frequency of nocturnal 665 
hypoglycemia should be no more than it would be as part of daily living with 666 
diabetes.  Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include sweating, jitteriness, and not 667 
feeling well.  Just as at home, there is the possibility of loss of consciousness or 668 
seizures (convulsions) and that for a few days you may not be as aware of 669 
symptoms of low blood sugar.  Even if sev ere low blood sugar does occur, it almost 670 
always goes away quickly with treatment to raise the blood sugar.  671 
 672 
Risk of Hyperglycemia 673 
As with any person having insulin -dependent diabetes, there is always a risk of 674 
having a high blood sugar ( hyperglycemia).  The frequency should be no more than 675 
it would be as part of daily living with diabetes.    676 
 677 
Protection Against Risks and Treatment of Side Effects :  678 
Subjects will be given descriptions of possible side effects from wearing an infusion 679 
set, and local side ef fects with insulin infusion set s or Guardian sensor  insertion 680 
sets. They will be told to contact the study staff if they see any signs of a skin 681 
reaction.  Based on the severity of local skin reaction, topical anti -inflammatory 682 
medications can be used (suc h as topical steroids).  683 
 684 
Other Risks 685 
Some subjects may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives 686 
used to secure the CGM  sensor , or to secure the insulin infusion sets for the 687 
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion ( CSII).  If these reactions occur, different 688 
adhesives or “under -taping” (such as with IV 3000, Tegaderm, etc.) will be tried, 689 
sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topical steroid cream or other medication 690 
may be required.  691 
 692 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection.  The CGM 693 
sensor and insulin infusion set sites are inserted under the skin.  It is possible that 694 
any part that is inserted under the skin may cause an infection.  These occur very 695 
infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur,  oral and/or topical antibiotics can be 696 
used.  The risk of skin problems could be greater if a sensor  or infusion set  is used 697 
for extended periods of time.  Therefore participants will be carefully instructed 698 
about daily inspection of their sensor and infusion set sites . 699 
 700 
Data downloaded from the CGM  sensor , insulin  pump, and the home glucose and 701 
ketone meter s will be collected for the study as measures of diabetes self - 702 
management  behaviors.  Some people may be uncomfortable with the researchers' 703 
having suc h detailed information about their daily diabetes habits .   704 
 705 
CHAPTER 5:  MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS  706 
 707 
Potential Benef its 708 
Fiasp®  may provide a more rapid onset of insulin action and improved post -prandial 709 
glycemic control.  710 
 711 
Subject Compensation 712 
For Part 1,  participants  will be compensated  $50 for each visit, $15 for completing 713 
weekly uploads to Carelink for a maximum payment of $245.  For part 2, subject will 714 
receive $50 for each visit , and $2 0 for uploading to Carelink and contact with the 715 
investigators every two weeks they are in the extension phase.   Maximum payment 716 
of $160.   Compensation of partial participation will be prorated.   717 
 718 
Subject Withdrawal  719 
Participation in the study is voluntary, and a subject may withdraw at any time.  The 720 
investigator may withdraw a subject who is not complying with the protocol. For 721 
subjects who withdraw, their data will be used up until the time of withdrawal.  722 
 723 
Subject Discontinuation Criteria 724 
Subjects who become pregnant will be discontinued from the study.  The 725 
investigator may withdraw a subject who is not complying with the protocol. 726 
Withdrawal of a subject will be considered for the following reasons:  1) Failure to 727 
monitor their sensor and infusion sites on a daily basis ; 2) developing >1.0 mmol/L 728 
ketones  on 2 or more occasions and failing to change their infusion set  or a single 729 
episode of diabetic ketoacidosis due to an infusion site failure.  For subjects who 730 
withdraw  or who are withdrawn, their data will be used for analysis purposes up until 731 
the time of withdrawal.  732 
 733 
Confidentiality  734 
For security and confidentiality purposes, subjects will be assigned an identifier that 735 
will be used instead of their name.  De -identified subject information may also be 736 
provided to Medtronic Diabetes .   737 
 738 
Level of Risk 739 
This research proposal in children is consistent with United States Department of 740 
Health and Human Services, Protection of Human Subjects, Subpart D, Section 741 
46.404  (Research not involving more  than minimal risk ).   742 
 743

CHAPTER 6:  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  747 
 748 
This is a pilot study to determine if there are any clinical issues with using Fiasp®  in 749 
the 670G hybrid closed -loop system.   These studies are not statistic ally powered.  750 
 751 
In the blinded cross -over studies (P art I) we will use data obtained during the 752 
second week of each arm to compare the following measurements  using a mixed- 753 
effects model accounting for crossover study design of the study with the sequence 754 
of trea tment nested within the patient : 755 
a) time in range (70- 180 mg/dl)  756 
b) percent time <70 mg/dl,  757 
c) mean glucose,  758 
d) glucose CV,  759 
e) total daily insulin dose,  760 
f) total daily basal insulin,  761 
g) insulin delivery form MN to 6AM, and 6AM to MN   762 
 763 
We will test to see if there is any difference in pharmacodynamics when using 764 
Fiasp® in the home environment when they are eating their usual breakfast.   765 
Insulin pharmacodynamics following the standard breakfast will be assessed by 766 
measuring the peak gluc ose concentration (C max), time to C max (tmax), and estimated 767 
average glucose excursions were assessed using sensor glucose values at a time 768 
interval of 0 to 180 minutes after breakfast bolus.  If a bolus was given between 769 
120-180 minutes following the breakfast bolus, CGM values were only used up to 770 
the time of the bolus.  The glucose at the time of the br eakfast bolus (Time 0) will be 771 
set to 0  mg/dL  for each meal, and the remaining CGM values were adjusted 772 
proportionally to allow analysis of postprandi al glucodynamic parameters.  We will 773 
utilize  a mixed- effects model accounting for crossover study design of the study with 774 
the sequence of treatment nested within the patient.  Breakfast meals are excluded 775 
from postprandial analysis if: 1) the rat e of change was greater than 0.3mg/dL/min 776 
in the 1 hour prior to breakfast, 2) subjects gave a subsequent bolus prior to 120 777 
minutes following the breakfast bolus, or 3) subjects deviated from their typical 778 
breakfast.   Dinner meals will be assessed when there has been no additional food 779 
intake after dinner.  The duration of insulin delivery to cover the meal will be 780 
determined by the time it takes the post prandial glucose to reach 16 0 mg/dL 781 
beyond 1 hour of eating.  The peak glucose will also be recorded.  782 
 783 
During t he 6 week  optimization study (Part II)  we will use data obtained during the 784 
first two weeks of the study (before data was reviewed and changes made by the 785 
investigators) to data obtained during the last two weeks of the 3 month optimization 786 
period.  We wil l compare the following measurements using paired t -tests for data 787 
with a normal distribution and a Mann- Whitney rank sum test for data that is not 788 
normally distributed:  789 
a) time in range (70- 180 mg/dl)  790 
b) percent time <70 mg/dl,  791 
c) mean glucose,  792 
d) glucose CV,  793 
e) total daily insulin dose,  794 
f) total daily basal insulin,  795 
g) insulin delivery form MN to 6AM, and 6AM to MN  796 
h) CHO:I ratios at breakfast, lunch and dinner  797 
i) Active insulin time  798 
j) Number of days between infusion set changes  799 
k) Erythema (mm) and induration (mm) at infusion sites  when they are changed  800 
l) Average daily insulin, and mean glucose for each day of infusion set wear  801 
m) Number of episodes of unexplained hyperglycemia in the first month vrs the 802 
last month 803

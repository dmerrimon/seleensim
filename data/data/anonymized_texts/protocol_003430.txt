RESEARCH CONSENT FORM
Protocol Title:  Phone-Based Postpartum Continuing Care:  Smoking 
Cessation Beginning in Pregnancy 
Study No.: HP-00054014
Principal Investigator:    Katrina Mark, MD, 410-328-4204
Sponsor:  National Institutes of Health (NIH)
You have been invited to take part in a study of pregnant and postpartum ( the period  beginning 
immediately  after the birth  of a child)  women offered at this clinic, Maryland Women’s Center (MWC). 
The process by which you learn about the study and make your decision is called informed consent.  Joining this study is voluntary.  When all your questions have been answered, you will decide if you want to be in the study.  If you agree to take part, you will sign this consent form. We will give you a signed copy to keep.  
PURPOSE OF STUDY
The main purpose of the study is to improve the existing services to pregnant and postpartum 
women who smoke or who have smoked tobacco in the recent past.  The study will develop and expand treatment and support for pregnant and postpartum women.
Some pregnant women who smoked prior to pregnancy cut down or quit smoking during 
pregnancy but start smoking again and in greater amounts once the baby is born. A return to smoking has negative health effects for the baby and mothers. We are concerned about this problem and are interested in developing a continuing care program that extends from pregnancy into the postpartum period. 
As things are hectic soon after a new baby is born, we believe a telephone-based postpartum 
continuing care program that offers smoking cessa tion (the act of quitting smoking) counseling is 
a good way to reach new mothers. This study will test the effectiveness of the phone-based postpartum continuing care (PPCC). 
PPCC takes a hands-on approach to identify women who are having cravings to smoking or have 
started smoking again.  PPCC will help women who are having a hard time and assist them in regaining control over their cravings. 
You will be one of approximately 130 pregnant females age 18 years or older to take part in this 
study at MWC.
You can take part in this study if you are less than 27 weeks pregnant and you are planning to keep your baby.

Page 2 of 8PROCEDURES
If you agree to participate you will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin, to one of the 
following two groups at week 26 of your pregnancy:
oStandard Continuing Care 
oExperimental Phone-based Postpartum Continuing Care (PPCC)
Neither you nor the study staff will choose what group you get assigned to.  A computer program 
will assign you to a group.  You will have an equal chance of being in either group.  
If by chance you are selected to the PPCC, you will receive in the mail a package with a letter 
letting you know when you will receive your first call.  In the package you will also find a manual called “Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby” to use along with the calls and a pedometer to help you stay fit and healthy during the weeks ahead and beyond.  A Counselor will call you in week 36 of your pregnancy and will continue to call you for 6 months.  You will receive ten calls from a PPCC Counselor and we encourage you to use the manual to follow along with the calls.  All sessions will be digitally recorded for quality control and training purposes.  In the calls, the PPCC Counselor will discuss things known to be associated with smoking, such as mood, stress, and partner support. The PPCC counselors will also educate you on how to reduce the risks of nicotine transmission to your infant that are passed by breastfeeding while smoking or smoking in the presence of your child.  Each call will take 15-30 minutes.  You are encouraged to call in at any time if you are having cravings or would like the support of your PPCC Counselor.
If by chance you are selected in the Standard Continuing Care group you will receive referrals to 
a 24/7 smoking quit line.
As part of the study, regardless of the group to which you are selected, you will have evaluations.  
The evaluations will ask questions to see how you are doing.  We will ask you to answer questions about stressors in your life, your emotional and social support, and your alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. 
The evaluations will occur at six time points: 
oEnrollment (“intake”) 
o3 months post-intake 
o6 months post-intake 
o6 weeks postpartum 
o3 months postpartum 
o6 months postpartum 
The evaluations may be scheduled at the same time as your regular appointments or outside of 
your clinical visits.  If you prefer we can come to your home to complete the evaluations.  
As part of the study we will ask for a urine sample to measure the levels of cotinine (a by-product 
of nicotine) in your body.  If the study evaluations are done at the same time as your prenatal and postpartum appointments, we will use the urine you normally give as part of your clinical appointments to test for cotinine levels.  If the study evaluations do not coincide with your clinic appointments, we will collect a urine sample from you to test cotinine levels.  At the 6 months postpartum time point, we will test the cotinin e level of your child.  This will be done by placing

Page 3 of 8cotton rolls or urine collection pads in your child’s diaper upon arrival to your visit (at home or at 
the clinic) and removing the cotton rolls or pads after completing the evaluations to test for cotinine level.
The evaluations will take no longer than 30 minutes to complete at each time point. The same 
measures will be completed each time.  
We realize that contact information and living arrangements can change unexpectedly, so to help 
research staff keep in touch with you over the course of the study and schedule your follow-up evaluations, we would like to gather information about several alternate ways we may be able to contact you. We will document this information on a Locator Form. Research staff from MWC or Battelle Centers Memorial Institute/Public Health Research & Evaluation may attempt to contact 
you at any of the addresses or phone numbers listed to schedule and/or complete your follow-up evaluations. 

You will be compensated with a Wal-Mart gift card for your time and effort at each study evaluation.  
There are a total of six evaluations. Bus tokens may also be provided if needed for transportation to the clinic. No incentive will be offered for missed or skipped visits.
POTENTIAL RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:
You may experience potential risks and discomforts from the study evaluations and the PPCC 
calls.  
There is a potential risk of breach of confidentiality (privacy).  Loss of confidentiality will be 
minimized by storing data in a secure and locked location and using only research ID numbers instead of your name on both the evaluations and the calls.  In order to protect information about your identity and data with your answers, we will keep them in two separate files that are only linked through a research ID.  We will only report data on groups of people.  Electronic data will be password-protected.  
If there is a question that you are not comfortable answering you do not need to answer it.  You 
can stop at anytime if you do not wish to continue.  If you have something very private to say, you have the right to tell the research staff or PPCC Counselor to turn off the recorder.
Should mental distress be reported to research staff or PPCC Counselor, they will call the 
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline with you on the line and/or offer appropriate local referrals to resources available.
In the event that you miscarry, you will be referred to the clinic’s on-site psychiatrist and/or 
social worker for appropriate community referrals for both mental health and smoking cessation.  You can choose whether to continue or discontinue participation in the study at that time. 
In the event of preterm birth, you will continue to be in the study and special considerations will 
be made to conduct follow-up interviews where and when it is most convenient for you. 
There may be risks in this study which are not yet known.

Page 6 of 8You should understand that a certificate does not prevent you or a member of your family from 
releasing information about your involvement in this research if you want to.  Note, however, that if an insurer, employer, or other person learns about your participation and you say it is all right for them to have this research information, then the investigator may not use the Certificate of Confidentiality to withhold this information from them.  This means you must actively protect your own privacy.  You have to be careful about whom you permit to look at your research information.  
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing voluntarily, without your consent, information that would identify you as a participant in the research project if we find out about child/elder abuse, harm to self/others, etc., as we will report it to the appropriate authorities.  
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW
Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to take part in this research. You 
are free to withdraw your consent at anytime. Refusal to take part or to stop taking part in the study will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.

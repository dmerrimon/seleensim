 2.0 Introduction and Background 
2.1 Introduction and Background 
The accurate detection and localization of cancers in vivo  are critical to medical decisions 
and improved treatments. Unfortunately, limitations of contrast (reporter) agents, 
resolution, and restrictions of depth reduce the ability of most imaging methods to detect 
and localize multiple contrast agents simultaneously. Alternatively, optical -fluorescent 
imaging can simultaneously detect multiple biomarkers using fluorescently labeled peptides or antibodies as contrast agents; however, these approaches are restricted to 
superficial detection, as light scattering degrades the spatial resolution at increased 
penetration depths greater than 8 mm. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is emerging as an alternative modality that is not restricted by many of the limitations of the imaging used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases
1. MSOT was initially developed for 
research, but has been adapted for clinical uses2-4 (see Table 1). 
 Optoacoustic imaging is based upon a “light -in, sound-out,” i.e. shining a light into the 
tissue and 
when the light hits the tissue, it can send a sound wave which we will capture 
using the MSOT device , approach through which absorption of near -infrared light (NIR) 
within biological tissues generates ultrasonic waves with much l ess scattering, longer 
range of detection, and higher accuracy compared with traditional optical imaging. The optoacoustic approach is unique, with increased optical contrast and signal -to-noise 
ratios
1. Optoacoustic imaging retains the advantages of optical imaging, including high 
specificity to identify functional and molecular processes in living organisms with high sensitivity. Most tissues are relatively transparent to NIR light in the range of 600 to 900 nm; therefore, use of NIR light excitation and ultrasound signals renders photon scattering 
irrelevant to image formation, enabling high-resolution images of the biological function 
of tumors and organs. Once the sound waves are generated, they obey  the physical laws 
of sound transmission; the intensity of the sound increases with the number of molecules excited, but is reduced by distance and the extent of ultrasound diffraction due to different 
densities of tissue. In MSOT, multiple spectral components of NIR light are varied 
automatically to excite specific molecules, permitting accurate tomographic images to be constructed from the resulting ultrasonic signals. MSOT is also unique in its ability 
to detect multiple contrast agents 
simultaneously based upon differential spectral shape.  
Changes in vasculature are often 
associated with both tumor development 
and progression, but microvascular changes occur below the resolution of common clinical imaging modalities. 
MSOT identifies microvascularity and 
tissue oxygenation by hemoglobin absorption of multiple wavelengths of light to generate high optoacoustic contrast
1,4-6.

absorbers that serve as endogenous 
contrast for MSOT  
Version 6.0 (21-Jul-2021)  
Confidential    Page 6 of 30 
 Because oxy - and deoxy -hemoglobin each generate a unique optoacoustic signal, both 
oxy- and deoxy -hemoglobin can be observed simultaneously without the addition of 
exogenous contrast agents using MSOT (Figure 1). MSOT can distinguish between 
oxygenation states of hemoglobin, i.e. oxy -hemoglobin vs deoxy -hemoglobin, allowing 
visualization of differential blood saturation by oxygen within tissues, including the 
capability to differentiate between tumor and the surrounding tissue2,7 as well as 
inflammation associated with Crohn’s disease3.  
Imaging of tumors and cancer -related morphologic changes in tissues by MSOT is 
facilitated through exogenous contrast agents, including clinically approved optical dyes (e.g., isosulfan blue or indocyanine green)
8, markers targeted to cell surface molecules, 
for example, EGFR 11, the tumor microenvironment (e.g., pH)9, and endogenous 
absorbers (i.e., oxyhemoglobin)2,10. Use of MSOT in multiple tissue types and at varying 
depths, i.e., at least 5 cm3,8, can provide functional real -time three-dimensional (3D) 
information at high spati al resolution in vivo1. This ability will have a significant impact on 
clinical care in systemic diseases, including cancer involving multiple organs. The ability of MSOT to identify tumors indicates great potential for clinical applicability for  solid 
tumors, such as melanoma, head and neck, breast, pancreatic, prostate, colon, and potentially, liver cancer.  
 
2.2 Clinical Studies  
MSOT has been used in research1,6,11,12 and clinical studies2,3,7,8 (including 6 clinical trials 
described in Table 1) and there has been no evidence of serious adverse events associated with the use of the device. Using a similar instrument in breast cancer, an optoacoustic imaging system from Seno Medical Instruments has received a CE mark in 
April 2014. Confirmatory studies for product approval of this particular device and specific 
indication have been started during the last years (with a focus on safety and performance).  Presently, there has not been any association of phototoxicity associated 
with the use of MSOT in any clinical trial ( Table 1).

 5.0 Subject Registration and Enrollment  
5.1 Required protocol specific regulatory doc uments  
This protocol, the Informed Consent document, any information to be given to the 
patient, and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB by the 
Principal Investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB before the study is 
activated.  
5.2 Patient Registration and Enrollment  
 
Patients must have signed and dated all applicable consents and authorization forms to be registered in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS)  system, 
which is sponsored by The University of Oklahoma Stephenson Cancer Center (OU-SCC). 
First, the study site should send the required documentation to 
SCC-IIT -
Office@ouhsc.edu  for confirmation of eligibility. A Screening identification 
(Screening ID) number will be provided by OU -SCC research staff. After all 
screening procedures and assessments have been completed and eligibility has 
been established, the subject Study ID number will be generated by OU -SCC. 
Once the patient has been provided a Study ID number, only the Study ID number 
should be used.  
Patients must not start protocol procedures prior to registration and enrollment. A 
patient will start protocol procedures only after the pre-treatment evaluation is 
complete and eligibility criteria have been met.  
NOTE: Per the Institutional Review Board (IRB) reporting, a patient is considered 
accrued once he or she signs a consent form for the study. A patient is considered enrolled once the patient begins treatment.

7.0 Study Plan 
7.1 Study -Related Activities   
Study Procedures  
• Upon receipt of a signed consent form, the research study team will generate a unique identification number so that subjects are de-identified for analysis of data. Any 
standard imaging measurements will be added in Appendix A and B
. This unique 
identification number will be used on the case report form (
Appendix A  and B ).  
• Patients will go through standard care procedures to prepare for surgery. Medically established diagnostic procedures will be used to detect tumor and lymph node 
margins.  
• To evaluate the safety of MSOT  (Figure 2), 
the device will be used to obtain images of 
the tumor or lymph node margins for  investigational use only to compare t o clinical 
pathology and patient’s medical record.   
• As part of the standard of care surgery preparation for cancer resection for all tumor types, patients will be injected with standard doses of Isosulfan Blue/  Indocyanine (IC) 
Green for either lymph node or tumor identification as part of the standard surgical 
procedure. The MSOT device will detect the presence of dye at the standard dose of 
dye used for surgical evaluation of tissue.

 • Images will be obtained pre- and post -surgery  (example simulation of operating room 
shown Figure 3 ). All 
imaging will be done 
in a closed surgical 
patient; no imaging will be performed on an open surgical 
patient. Dr. Lacey 
McNally has been trained in the use of the MSOT Acuity by the manufacturer, and 
she will be the MSOT 
operator for all MSOT imaging for this study. Dr. McNally will train 
the surgeon and 
surgical staff in the proper procedure for using the handheld 
detector and will maintain training records for this purpose. Only Dr. Mc Nally and her 
research staff will perform post -imaging analysis on the de-identified digital images 
stored on the MSOT Acuity. The pathologist and clinician will perform all clinical evaluations of tumor samples as well as post -imaging assessment of treatm ent area 
and report where indicated on the imaging case report form. MSOT imaging will be for 
research only and no treatment decisions will be based on the MSOT images 
obtained.  
• Logistics: The MSOT device will be used in The University of Oklahoma Health 
Sciences Center (OUHSC), and will reside in a temperature controlled and locked 
room . 
Table 2 Clinical Protocol for MSOT Imaging 
Step  Description  
1 Prior to the time of surgery, the MSOT operator will ensure that the MSOT Acuity has  
been cleaned according to the manufacturer’s recommendations found in the Instructi on 
Manual -MSOT Acuity Cleaning & Disinfection.  
2 A case report form with a unique identification number will be generated for each study 
participant (Appendix A ). 
3 The MSOT operator will maneuver the MSOT Acuity to the operating room and plug uni t 
into proper electrical outlet. The MSOT Acuity will be positioned to allow easy access to 
the region of interest for imaging. The  wheels will be locked into place to prevent 
acquisition unit from rolling during imaging.

number as the Patient ID.  
8 The MSOT operator will Click on the Examination tab in the task bar to open 
the Examination screen.  
 
9 The Select preset * window will open, 
and the MSOT operator will choose the Hb, HbO

*NOTE : Wavelengths and power 
settings are factory preset and cannot be changed manually by the user.   
      
 
 
 
10 The system performs an automatic system self -test each time the Examination  screen is 
accessed for the first time after the system was switched on.  
11 The transducer  must remain in the magnetic probe holder  fixed to the acquisition unit until 
the system self -test has been completed. If the ultrasound probe is not in the probe holder, 
the MSOT operator will make sure that it is placed there.  
12 The staff will don safety goggles. The MSOT operator can 
control laser activation and deactivation via touch screen or 
keyboard in combination with the connected foot pedal.

 13 The MSOT operator will hold the foot pedal until the self -test routine is finished. If the 
self-test is interrupted by releasing the foot pedal before the system self-test has been 
finalized, the test routine will need to be performed again.  
14 A blue indicator in the signaling device on top of the 
system and in the front panel shows that the laser is ready 
for emission.  
  
 
15 The MSOT operator will record the self -test completion on the case report form and note 
the Start  scan time. 
NOTE:  THE FOOT PEDAL WILL BE RELEASED ONCE SELF -TEST ROUTINE IS COMPLETE.  
 
16 The MSOT operator will tell the surgical team when the self -test routine has been 
successfully completed.  
17 The MSOT operator will remove the probe from the magnetic 
holder to disinfect it using a germicidal disposable wipe (Sani -
Cloth AF3, PDI, Orangeburg, NY), ensuring that the entire surface 
of the probe is moistened with the disinfectant.   
 
18 The MSOT operator will remove a second wipe from the package and repeat the 
disinfection process, ensuring that the entire surface of the probe is moi stened with the 
disinfectant and allowed to dwell for at least 3 minutes.  
NOTE: MSOT Operator will note dwell time on Imaging Case Report Form (Appendix A ). 
 
19 After the 3 -minute exposure time of the disinfectant, the MSOT operator will dry the probe 
surface with a commercially available, single -use, lint -free, low -germ towel.  
20 A member of the surgical team will cover the handheld probe with a single -use ultrasoni c 
probe drape (US.10.150.080, SonoGuard, Promecon GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), whi ch will be the only part of the Acuity device to make contact with the patient, see  (
Figure 3). 
 
21 Once time -out procedures have been completed, the surgical team will prepare the 
patient/region of interest on the skin for the initial MSOT scanning.  
22 The skin surface will be cleaned following standard procedures . The skin will be dry 
without any alcohol pooling per manufacturer i nstructions , then ultrasound gel (#03- 034, 
Aquasonic clear ultrasound gel, Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ) will be applied to 
the area to be scanned.  
23 The surgeon will place the imaging probe on the prepped skin area to be imaged BEFORE 
the la ser is activated to avoid excess laser radiation.  
24 Once the surgeon has the probe in place, the MSOT operator will press the foot pedal to 
activate the laser radiation for imaging. The MSOT operator will communicate with the 
surgeon as an image is acqui red and coordinate the timing of the laser activation for 
additional scans. Release of the foot pedal will immediately shut down the laser system 
and stop the imaging procedure.  
25 The MSOT operator will record Scan comments  on the screen to be saved for each image 
acquired in the image sequence.  
NOTE:  Total number of images acquired in the image sequence will be recorded on the Imaging Case Report Form 
(Appendix A ).

26 A yellow indicator in the signaling device on top of the 
system and in the front panel shows that laser light is 
emitted through the aperture of the handheld probe. Keep the aperture of the probe on the region of interest or towards the floor. NEVER direct the aperture of the probe towards eyes while this indicator is on.  
Once the foot pedal is released laser emission is stopped and the laser emission indicator will turn off.  
  
 
27 The patient will undergo surgery for resection of the identified volume of tissue accordi ng 
to standard care.  
28 After tumor or lymph node removal and incision has been closed, the area of interest will 
be reimaged by MSOT to obtain post -surgery images in the operating room by repeating 
steps 16 through 23.  
29 An estimate of the percent amount of tumor remaining will be estimated by algorithms 
within in the MSOT computer programming for investigational use only . 
30 The resected tumor will be taken to Pathology for volume assessment and pathological 
identification per medically established diagnostic standard care.  
31 Data from the MSOT imaging is for research purposes only and not for treatment , and 
digital images will be kept on the MSOT computer, which will be stored in a secured room 
accessible only to study personnel.  
32 Key parameter s will be recorded on (Appendix A  and B). 
7.2 Duration of Follow Up 
 
Subjects will be actively enrolled only for the duration of pre-op through 
surgical recovery, and until post-op discharge unless any  study -related 
adverse event occurs. Medical record review will occur up to 6 months to allow 
for follow -up pathology assessments to be gathered and provide information 
to allow for analyses to be performed as previously described.  
7.3 Criteria for Removal fro m Study  
 
Patients can request to withdraw from the study at any time. Should patients 
consent to the study, but have tumor progression that prevents them from being a surgical candidate within 30 days, these patients  may be removed at 
the Investigator’s discretion. T here is no reason to remove a patient 
otherwise from the study.

 8.0 Adverse Events List and Reporting Requirements  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered an investigational product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), sy mptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medical product, whether or not considered related to the medical product. All AEs are assessed by the center for severity, causality, outcome, 
seriousness, and if unanticipated.  
8.1 Adverse Event List for MSOT   
 
A slight, reversible reddening and temperature increase of sensitive skin. 
All adverse events and expected treatment effects, including mild events, 
will be monitored throughout the study  until discharge.  
8.2 Adverse Event Characteristics 
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and 
grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. 
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the 
CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
• ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ (see Section 
8.1 above) for expedited reporting purposes only.   
 
• Attribution of the AE:  
 
- Definite – The AE is clearly  related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely  related  to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
8.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
 
Serious is defined as  an adverse event that results in the following outcome:  
• Death  
• L ife-threatening event  (i.e. an event that places the patient, in the 
view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred). This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death  
Version 6.0 (21-Jul-2021)  
Confidential    Page 17 of 30 
 • Requires or prolongs hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• C ongenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical  
judgement, may jeopardize the patient, and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
8.4 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  Reporting Requirements  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) means any serious  adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or  application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
A medical review shall immediately occur with all reported Unanticipated 
Adverse Device Effects (UADE). The UADE shall be assessed for an 
unreasonable risks’  determination. If an unreasonable risk has been 
determined, then the trial or the parts that cause the risk shall be stopped 
between 5-15 working days  after making the determination.  
 
8.5 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or 
Deviations 
 
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, 
deviations or protocol changes will be promptly reported by the princi pal 
investigator to the IRB and sponsor or appropriate government agency, if 
appropriate and per institutional guidelines.  
 A description of all AEs and UADEs will be recorded on REDCap. All UADEs should be reported using the Sponsor Form (UADE Reporting Form) and MedWatch3500A to the following email or fax within 24 hours of 
the site notification of the event:  
 Email: SCCIITreporting@ouhsc.edu or  
Fax: 1 -405-271-1416  
 In compliance with FDA regulations 21 CFR 812.150, any UADEs occurring during the investigation should be reported to the sponsor and reviewing IRB within 10 days of first notice of the event. The sponsor will conduct an 
Version 6.0 (21-Jul-2021)  
Confidential    Page 18 of 30 
 evaluation of the UADE and report t he results of such evaluation as an 
UADE Report to FDA, all reviewing IRBs, and participating investigators 
within 10 working days after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect.  
 
An UADE Report will consist of a completed MedWatch 3500A form and a 
cover letter that provides an analysis of the event. Thereafter the sponsor shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as per requests from FDA . 
 
8.6 Post -imaging Procedural Events for MSOT 
 
The post -imaging procedural events for MSOT are those events that are 
expected and standard to post -imaging as for ultrasound and include slight, 
reversible reddening and temperature increase of sensitive skin for a 
duration of ≤ 24 hours post -surgery. All unexpected events shall be 
captured. Post -imaging procedural events that occur in increased frequency 
and severity over what should normally occur in the medical opinion of the 
investigator will be considered adverse events (AE). AEs will be reported.  
9.0 Data and Safety Monitoring 
Safety oversight will be performed by Stephenson Cancer Center’s (SCC) internal Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The DSMC is composed of individuals with 
the appropriate expertise in adult and pediatric hematology and medical oncology, radiation oncology, translational and correlative science, pharmacy, nursing and biostatistics. The DSMC operates under the rules of an approved data safety monitoring 
plan which complies with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines published as 
Essential Elements of a Data and Safety  Monitoring Plan for Clinical Trials Funded by 
NCI as of January 2005 and the “ NIH Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring,” NIH Guide 
for Grants and Contracts , http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html
. 
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee is charged with oversight of participant safety, study conduct and the validity and integrity of data for clinical trials at SCC. While the focus of the DSMC is to monitor i nterventional investigator -initiated trials (IITs) that are 
not subject to external monitoring, it has the authority to monitor any SCC protocol when potential concerns are identified. The DSMC also has the authority to suspend or close a 
study until the principal investigator addresses any issues that may cause harm or 
increase risks to subjects.  The DSMC reports all findings to the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
Version 6.0 (21-Jul-2021)  
Confidential    Page 19 of 30 
 Under the direction of the DSMC chair, a full board meeting is convened on a quarterly 
basis to review the accumulated safety data, accrual information, and additional 
information as stated in the DSMC plan.  
9.1 DSMC Auditing 
 
In addition to monitoring, the DSMC oversees an internal auditing process to ensure 
subject safety and data quality. All cancer -related clinical trials active at the SCC are 
eligible for audit; however, priority is placed on those clinical trials that are not monitored 
or audited by an outside entity. If an external entity conducts an audit of a clinical trial at the SCC, th en the findings of that audit are reported to the DSMC, either through the 
formal audit report provided by the external auditing entity, if available, or from the PI, 
who will report any findings communicated during the audit process.
 
 
9.2 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.2.1  Data Quality Assurance  
 
Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) will be responsible for clinical 
monitoring of all data for this study.  
 
9.2.2  Electronic Database and Case Report Forms  
 
The Principal Investigator and designated team will develop a study -specific 
electronic database in REDCap and study -specific case report forms for 
study data entry.  All study data will be recorded into the REDCap database 
sponsored by OU -SCC and stored in a 21 CFR 11-compliant database . 
Appendix A and B will be paper based and later scanned into REDCAP.  
Only the Investigator and assigned research staff will have ac cess to the 
study data.  All  case report forms will be available to Sponsor, IRB or 
regulatory authorities in event of an audit or inspection.    
 
9.2.3  Data Disclosure  and Subject Confidentiality  
 
Subject medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered 
confidential. Disclosure to third parties other than those noted below is prohibited. All reports and communications relating to subjects in this study will identify each subject only by their initials and number. Medical 
information resulting from a subject’s participation in this study may be given 
to the subject’s personal physician or to the appropriate medical personnel responsible for the subject ’s welfare. Data generated as a result of this 
study are to be available for inspection on request by FDA or other 
government regulatory agency inspectors, the SCC clinical trial office 
auditors and monitors, Office of Compliance, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) . 
Version 6.0 (21-Jul-2021)  
Confidential    Page 20 of 30 
 All evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will be 
identified by a coded number , and/or initials to maintain subject 
confidentiality. All study records will be kept in a locked file cabinet or other 
secured area. All computer entry and networking programs will be 
identifiable only by coded numbers and/or initials. Subject personal medical 
information may be reviewed by representatives of the Sponsor, IRB, or regulatory authorities in the course of monitoring the progress of the clinical trial. Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain such information as 
confidential.  
9.2.4  Record Ret ention 
 
In accordance with 21 CFR 812.140, t he Sponsor and Investigator  will retain 
all research documents  relating to the participation in the clinical trial.   
These documents must be retained for a period of two years after the date 
on which the investigation is terminated or completed, or the date that the 
records are no longer required for purposes of supporting a premarket 
approval application, a notice of completion of a product development protocol, a humanitarian device exemption application, a prem arket 
notification submission, or a request for De Novo classification.  
 
If the transfer of records custody  during the retention period is accepted by 
any other person, notice of transfer must be given to FDA not later than 10 working days after transfer occurs.  
 
9.3 Study Monitoring 
 
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored at periodic intervals throughout the study per FDA/ICH “Guidance for Industry – E6 Good Clinical Practice: 
Consolidated Guidance” dated April 1996. All Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be 
up to 100% source verified against corresponding source documentation (e.g., 
office and clinical laboratory records) for each s ubject. The monitoring visits 
provide the PI with the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study, to verify appropriate consent form procedures, and to verify the accuracy and 
completeness of CRFs, to resolve any inconsistencies in the study records  and to 
assure that all protocol requirements, applicable FDA regulations, other 
requirements, and Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled.  
Furthermore, this study will fall under the purview of the Stephenson Cancer 
Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  
10.0 Statistical Considerations 
10.1 Analysis of Primary Objective 
  
Version 6.0 (21-Jul-2021)  
Confidential    Page 21 of 30 
 10.1.1  The primary objectives are to estimate the rate of adverse events 
and measure the skin temperature change following MSOT imaging  
both pre- and post -surgery .  The adverse events will  be estimated by 
grade, type and relatedness.  The first analysis will pool all grade 3 
unexpected events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to 
MSOT together and then construct a 95% exact Clopper -Pearson 
binomial confidence interval for thi s estimate.  Additionally, 
measurement of skin temperature will be evaluated where skin 
temperature greater than 44oC will be recorded13.  A 95% exact 
Clopper -Pearson binomial confidence interval for the evaluation of 
skin temperature will be conducted 
10.2 Analysis of Secondary Objective 
 
10.2.1  There are three secondary outcomes of interest, two of these will be 
based upon a positivity (yes/no) (secondary outcomes 1 and 3) and 
one of these will assess on a continuous scale tumor size/ volume 
(secondary outcome 2).  In each of these analyses, we will compare 
the information gathered from the MSOT approach (size, positivity 
tumor (yes/no) , positivity of dye (yes/no) ) for each patient and then 
compare these measures to those that are available from information 
gathered in the standard of care approach (i.e., from pathology reports after resection).  
 
For continuous outcomes we will examine three characteristics based on comparing the MSOT and standard of care (“gold standard”) assessments.  These include: 1) the mean difference in 
the measure (i.e., tumor volume or size), 2) the correlation between 
the measures taken using MSOT or standard of care; and 3) the 
comparison of variability of the measures from the two approaches (MSOT and standard of care).  For the first approach we will calculate a paired t -test, for the second we will estimate a Pearson correlation 
and for the third we will perform an F -test to compare the equality of 
variances.  With the expanded sample size of 50 patients we can 
detect a difference in v alues of volume (or size) equal to 0.4 standard 
deviations or less of the measure of difference in tumor volumes (or 
size) with 80% power using a paired t -test with alpha=0.05 (2-sided).  
In addition, there is 80% power to detect a correlation of 0.38 (or 
larger) with an alpha=0.05 (2-sided).  Finally, there is 80% power to detect a ratio of 2.24 (or larger) when comparing variances between 
the two groups (note: this ratio corresponds to a ratio of 1.5 on the 
standard deviation scale).    
 If the study is terminated early with 45 patients scanned, we can still 
detect a difference in values of volume (or size) equal to 0.43 
standard deviations or less of the measure of difference in tumor 
volumes (or size) with 80% power using a paired t -test with 
Version 6.0 (21-Jul-2021)  
Confidential    Page 22 of 30 
 alpha=0.05 ( 2-sided).  In addition, there is 80% power  to detect a 
correlation of 0.40 (or larger) with an alpha=0.05 (2-sided). 
Additionally, t here is 80% power to detect a ratio of 2.35 (or larger) 
when comparing variances between the two groups (note: this ratio 
corresponds to a ratio of 1.53 on the standard deviation scale)  
 
For binary outcomes (positivity  and presence of dye), we will 
estimate the MSOT approach and the corresponding 95% Clopper -
Pearson exact binomial confidence interval.  Accuracy is defined as the number of patients where the MSOT and standard of care 
approach are in agreement (i.e., both are positive or both are negative).  In addition, we can examine other characteristics of the two approaches including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
value and negative predictive values.  
10.3 Power and Sample Size   
 
10.3.1  We will initially accrue 10 patients for safety analysis regarding the 
use of the MSOT device pre- and post -surgery.  If there are no grade 
III-V AEs observed in the patients  as defined in CTCAE v5.0 per 
Section 8.2 , we will submit an IDE supplement  to request an 
enrollment expansion for an additional 40 patients , for a total of 50 
patients . Up to an additional 55 patients will be accrued (to account 
for patient dropouts ) to enroll 40 patients. Thus, a total of 50 patients  
will be enrolled and scanned (10 patients in the initial analysis and 
40 patients following the interim analysis) in order to gather sufficient 
data to evaluate the proportion of patients with adverse events that 
may be associated with the MSOT approach.  The MSOT approach 
is not expected to be related to any adverse events except for a 
possible slight, reversible reddening and temperature increase of sensitive skin.  Nevertheless, this study will allow us to estimate the proportion of unexpected adverse events of grade 3 or higher that 
are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the MSOT approach.  
With 50 patients, the upper bound of a 95% Clopper -Pearson exact 
confidence interval will be less than 20% if the observed rate of adverse events is 8% or less (4 out of 50 or less).  We expect that  
the actual value will be 0 out of 50 – and if this is observed the upper 
bound of this confidence interval will be 7.1% which would provide a useful upper bound for the potential of adverse events.   
 
The study will be terminated early , after 45 patients  in tot al are 
enrolled and scanned, if 3 or fewer AEs are observed in the patients 
scanned by the MSOT device, based on the assumption that the 
upper limit of the 95% Clopper -Pearson exact confidence interval will 
be less than 20%.  The upper limit of the 95% Clopper -Pearson exact 
confidence interval will be 7.9%, 11.7%, 15.1% or 18.3% respectively for 0, 1, 2, or 3 observed AE s. 
Version 6.0 (21-Jul-2021)  
Confidential    Page 23 of 30 
  
10.3.2  Interim analysis : This study will initially accrue 10 patients to identify 
any potential grade III or IV AEs defined in CTCAE v5.0 per Section 
8.2. As yet, no study using MSOT in over 600 patients has observed 
any grade III or IV AEs2,3,14,15. An interim analysis will be conducted 
after the first 10 patients. If there are no grade III or IV AEs observed 
in the patients, we will submit an IDE supplement with preliminary safety data, to request an enrollment expansion to 50 patients.
 If any 
grade V AEs occur during the investigation, the FDA will be notified 
immediately and the study halted for further accrual until discussed with 
FDA.  
10.4 Estimated Accrual Rate  
 
10.4.1  The estimated accrual rate is 10-20 patients per m onth after the 
initial accrual of 10 patients . 
 
10.5 Estimated Study Length   
 
10.5.1  Subjects will be actively enrolled only for the duration of pre-op 
through surgical recovery, and until post-op discharge unless  any 
study -related adverse event occurs.  Medical recor d review will occur 
up to 6 months to allow for follow -up pathology assessments to be 
gathered and provide information to allow for analyses to be performed as previously described.
